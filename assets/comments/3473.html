        There is the old joke (or new, as it is about the Euro) of the fat German who turns up at a Greek hotel and leaves a 500 Euro note with the manager for safe-keeping while Herr Schmidt goes sightseeing. The manager scoots off to pay the butcher the 500 Euros he owes him, the butcher takes note this to the cobbler for all the shoe repairs, the cobbler takes it to the local whore for services rendered, the hooker in turn runs to the hotel to pay for the rooms she hired.When Herr Schmidt returns to the hotel he reclaims his 500 Euro note, and everyone in the village is happy: all debts have been settled.There, that’s economics for you.

        The Greeks just want to go back to working their old scam.  They sell debt denominated in whatever the name is of their barely worth the paper it’s printed currency to suckers.  Then they purposely devalue the currency to even lower levels, paying back the chumps in toilet paper with numbers written in crayon.  In some parts of the world this is called fraud, but in pre-Euro Greece and Italy, this is what passed for monetary policy.  To get their hands on real currency, they made sure that there were few barriers to entry to fat German auto workers, English slags, and various Scandinavian pencil pushers.  The Greeks happily took their marks, pounds, and lutefisk (or whatever you call Scandinavian money), stuffed that in their mattresses, and used the pathetic Greek currency to wipe their arses as they laughed at the Northern European marks over ouzo.The real joke is that every banker and treasury official in Europe know this when they invited the Greek three-card monte dealers into the ECU.  Much like the nice guy who marries the local tramp, believing that his virtue would transform her into an honest woman, they will be ruined: financially, socially, and morally.

        No country was more ill-fit to join a trans-national organization which should never have  existed in the first place. Greeks love to not work. That is what they do. The largest employer is government, and no one in government works (not entirely a bad thing). People who like to work left the county, and didn’t come back. What Greeks like is to get paid for not working. The Germans made that possible, for a time.Yes, the Greeks can leave the EU, and the debt, and print their own money. They should. But of course everybody should  know that they will do a Weimar to that currency, because they are Greek.

        I can dig a little schadenfreude like the next guy but I hear a faint whisper from the graveyards in Flanders Field and Bergen Belsen that Europe melting down can have serious repercussions. Hope not.

            I think Mark Steyn has it right. In the past during times of crisis, Europeans looked for a man on a horse to lead them. Today, the men are too old and flabby to get on the horse.

        Dear Lord, preserve us from left-wing idiots.“The government that had put the country through an assault course of austerity would soon be over”Here’s the rub, Greece: the austerity you growl at is there because there is no money to pay for all the socialist excesses and spend-what-you-like philosophies your kind so enjoy. When you kill off the goose, the golden eggs stop appearing. Who knew?Oh sure, someone will come along and offer you money. That’s the thing about whores: someone will pay up for the (temporary) pleasure of your company.I live in another part of the EU. I’d rather not live in the EU at all, but the people who run my country think people such as me like being ruled by fat socialists in Brussels, aided by ex-communists in Berlin. Oh well, thank heavens Britain’s EU huge ‘membership fee’ precludes us having to find money to keep the Greeks solvent.Oh, wait…

        Greece has defaulted on its government debt many times within the last 150 years, and they will not hesitate to do so again.Aside from Russia, Iran and China will also look to make friends with Greece.Argentina still exists; they are running neck and neck with Greece as world champ defaulters
