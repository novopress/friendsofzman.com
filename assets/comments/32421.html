        It turns out Pat Buchanan Ross Perot, and Ron Paul were right. And the haughty American voters laughed at them.It is they who have the last laugh! Karma’s a bitch!

                Kamala perhaps *is* karma.  The epitome of AA absurdity in America!  If she does reach the highest office in the land, she will hold absolute claim to being the worse mediocrity to ever hold the office—and it will be to our country’s deserved detriment for creating and promoting such policy.

                        You know, you’re probably correct.  Most folk I deal with are humble and seem to realize that they “don’t know” everything.  In that way they prove to be good and wise citizens/neighbors—and more importantly, steadfast friends when needed.

            Poor Pat entered politics when legacy media had near total control of the landscape and the RNC was unified in a full neocon ideology. He didn’t stand a chance. If his career was 20 years later we would have likely had a President Buchanan instead of Trump.

                    He had a chance in 1996, but when we got to South Carolina after beating Dole in New Hampshire, we met the real Republican Party. We had doors slammed in our faces by folks from The Citadel and could not get volunteers. The Republican Party threatened anybody with permanent exile if they cooperated with us.It was an education for me, as I believed we were heading into Pat’s prime territory, and so did he. It was brutal, because everyone knew that the election was a joke (Dole was a cuck behind closed doors and only wanted the nomination; he had no intention of winning) and we were staring down four more years of Bill and Hill.I’ve never cared much for South Carolinians after that. They were the ones who put an end to Pat’s political career. They can have Moonface Tim Scott and Ladybug Lindsey forever.

                        I share your sentiments.  As a Floridian, there is something about the Carolinian people that just never sat right with me.  I cannot quite put my finger on it.  They seem foreign
I will take a person from Georgia or Bama or even Louisiana any day of the week.  Mississippi strikes me as a little off too, but in a different way
Such is life in the Southeast

                            We were close…if he had been able to win SC, I think we would’ve been able to get some momentum and cash going into the rest of the primaries, esp. Super Tuesday.
He wouldn’t have beaten Clinton, but he would’ve been the prime contender in 2000 in an open GOP field.

                            I see my fellow South Carolinians who support, Haley, Graham, and Scott as foreign as well. I voted for Buchanan in the 96 primary, but don’t recall knowing anyone else in my circle who did.  I remember being told that protectionist trade policies and foreign policy isolationism wasn’t the right approach for the country.  All the while, the manufacturing and textile industry was being gutted at the time.  The Republican Party had a complete stranglehold on Evangelicals then.  There has been a shift in South Carolina with Trump dominating the 2016 and 2024 primaries.

                            Bob Dole deserved this because during one contentious government shutdown instigated by Gingrich over Clintons refusal to go along with welfare reform.Gingrich was hours away from Clinton caving, when Dole went behind his back and made a deal with the Clintonistas to reopen the government.Bob Novak said of Dole, “Gingrich maneuvered himself and the party into a crusade against Washington. Dole is a creature of Washington and people like Dole don’t do well during a crusade.”that prompted the comment Gingrich made after Dole stabbed him in the back.

                        I’m talking domestic economic policy.Buchanan, Perot, Paul all balanced budget hawks.Although Trump is right about making other countries pay their share, he didn’t cut off much foreign aid at all. Especially to a certain sacred cow in the middle east.Trump is a Keynsian. If he thinks printing cheap money will stimulate the economy he will and did do it.

                I tend to believe that virtually anyone the Rs put up against H in 2016 would have won. I’ve never believed it was a triumph of “maga.” She lost it more than he won it. So while I think you are correct, I think it’s just as correct to say Mitt Romney could have won in 2016.

                    Yes and no – Hillary was reviled and rightfully so.  But a more genteel candidate (romney style) would not have been able to take advantage of it to the extent Trump did.  Love him or hate him, Trump showed he was a fighter.

                    Disagree strongly. It was Trump appealing to the previously ignored “Middle American Radicals,” (a term coined by Donald Warren, and a subsequent policy devised by Sam Francis and Pat Buchanan) that won the GOP nomination and defeated Hillary.
Jeb, Marco, Kasich and the rest of the GOP were a continuation of the tired global agenda which ignored regular white working folks, and had no hope of energizing them to defeat Hillary.  It took the populist campaign of Trump to defeat her.
When Trump took office, well, that’s another subject, that differs from his 2016 campaign.

            I worked for Buchanan in 92 and 96. It’s very hard to get any news about his health or Shelley’s. He has gone completely silent since his sudden retirement and all I have are rumors. I hope he has some peace now.

                If anyone knows, please write something. Obviously I’m not using my real name, but I did work for Pat. In the 2000s I lost touch with my last two remaining friends from the campaign as they drifted away from the world of politics entirely for other concerns. Life moved on.
It’s painful for me to have lost this man’s voice at the very moment when what he taught us would ripen has come to fruition. I wish I knew what he thought of this.

            American voters were warned many, many times of all of the impending disasters that were building up in American life over the past 40 years.  Already in the early 80s, demographers were warning of the impending SS disaster in the 2020s.  Around the turn of the century, a secretary of the treasury (or maybe it was some other high level bureaucrat, but I don’t recall. Maybe it was from budget office) quit to go on a tour warning Americans of the impending budget disasters.The American Society of Civil Engineers has been warning us for decades of the impending disaster of infrastructure which is rapidly aging.  We see our terrible air ports, but we don’t see the 100 year old decrepit dams just waiting to fail like happened last month to the Rapidan Dam.  Or diversity working in the DOTs causing failures with our ancient bridges and roads.  They all have the money to paint BLM and homoflag murals on the road, but they just cannot find the money to maintain bridges carrying 10s of thousands of cars and trucks a day.  The bridge that fell in Pittsburgh in 2020 or 2021 was a case study in ‘clownshow government.’  They inspected the bridge every year and every year it was rated unsafe in bad condition, complete with pictures of failing support.  The engineer’s recommendations were promptly ignored.  What is the point of an inspection if you will not act on the report you get?

                The doomsayers (count me among them) have been wrong, but that’s possibly because the doomsaying assumes some fiscal laws that have been defied, or disproven, since at least ‘08. We’ll see if debts don’t actually have to be repaid.

                    I have nothing more than vague impressions. The way our global economy is connected, it would only to take a few players to have a major impact in key areas. The key players don’t have complete control, but that was never required.In coordination, for a little while, a small group could appear to defy economic gravity for their own reasons.Some debts will never get repaid, but then we are over due for that. Economic debt jubilees are an act of mercy and kindness from the wealthy to the poor. The idea that we make debt slaves of our own society forever are the dreams of the avaristic, not the ordinary people.

                    Admittedly, I used to be a doomsayer, but I’ve stopped in recent years.  I am highly skeptical of a total collapse.  People saw the Soviet Union collapse and thought a societal governmental collapse was easily possible. But the SU didn’t collapse, the elite gave up and voluntarily ended it. It was obviously chaotic and they probably wouldn’t have given up if not for the economic and social conditions they were facing. But they probably could have gotten through those hard times if they had the political will to do so.But that isn’t to say that our problems aren’t very real and with very serious repercussions.  Whether or not AINO collapses, we’re still going to see infrastructure collapses. Bridges will fall. Dams will fail. Roads will deteriorate and many other failures.  We could have spent our money upgrading century old infrastructure, but we chose to spend it on endless wars and grifts.One of the major reasons we have millions of people invading the US is they need the workers to pay the taxes to fund SS. It’s not really working because so many of these people get on the dole. But SS is at least one important reason for it. Same in Europe.  Heaven forbid the Boomers who chose not to have children would accept later retirement and means based SS payments.  Instead, they are selling out their country to ensure they get to spend the last years of their lives in hedonistic pleasure.

        “Americans are about to get poor because they no longer deserve to be otherwise.”Americans are poor because they are stupid.Ever since the 1980’s, Americans believed the lie that they can live on credit. They never challenged the fact that most college degrees are (a) useless (b) overpriced and have demonized blue collar workers. And even if they didn’t demonize blue collar work, they successfully outsourced those jobs.Americans believe they are somehow “entitled” to home ownership because it’s a “right”, no thanks to the Clinton administration. Americans think having a $75,000 pick up truck with a 72 month repayment plan of $1,400 at month at 8% interest is a good idea. Americans think paying $6.00 for a coffee at Starbucks is realistic. Americans are willing to spend $500 to take the family to Disneyland for a day. Americans believe they should be paid $20/hour for flipping burgers so they can somehow buy a house, car and raise a family.Europeans are not rich, but we’re not broke either. While the majority of us rent our homes, we’re not in debt or living on the streets. Our children may not be inventing the latest microchip or phone App, but they’re not saddled with university debt that will take them a lifetime to repay. We take 30-days of holiday and have the cash in our pockets to pay for it. Europeans have always lived modest lives and we’re okay living that way because it’s a smart way to live.So maybe you’re right. Americans did get exactly what they deserve.

            Home ownership should be attainable for the average American. We have plenty of space, infrastructure, and competence where it should be a given for anyone but the lowest level rung. Like the stock market, housing has been bought off by parasites with central bank money who need to plop it somewhere safe and has made it unaffordable to nearly everyone.Also, most Americans do live modestly, and the people you are describing are middle-upper class strivers who, while amounting to a lot of the consumption, are only 5-10 percent of the population. Americans spend most of their money escaping the diversity forced upon us.

                Don’t believe the hype!
The biggest reason housing is unaffordable is gorram gov’t policy. Since ’82, there has been a more or less steady tariff of at least 20% and strict quotas on imported softwood. They destroyed our timber industry with insane environist (there’s no “mental” in “environmentalists”) policies and Canada’s with making it illegal for Americans to buy as much as they wanted, at prices Canadians were willing to take.
Similar with steel, plastics, copper, aluminum, asphalt shingles, etc.

                Apparently adding 10 million illiterate, unskilled, dirt poor illegals to the population over the past 4 years along with another 10-20 million in the 20 years before that affected the housing supply.
Black swan, totally unpredictable, I guess.

                    Let’s use your numbers. 30 million is a little under 10% of the US population. Yes, heavily end-weighted so the last 4 is around 3%. Are you telling me you doubt we could have built ~1% more houses over the last 4? Why weren’t they built? Look at what the Greatest built on returning from WWII.
I don’t like immigration any more than you do. But the math is what it is.

                        Let’s move past ancient history and talk about today.Americans are not doing well and their children are in worse financial condition than their parents were at the same age. All economic and social indicators are pretty clear on that fact. It’s not just the lower or lower middle class, everyone in the US is being affected the same with the exception of the upper 1% (as is always the case anywhere).There are plenty of Americans making well into six figures, living in lovely HOA neighborhoods, who are literally one paycheck away from being on the street. So don’t kid yourself. It was like that when I lived in Silicon Valley back in the 80’s and nothing has changed. Their kids are in for a rude awakening when they try to follow in their parents footsteps.Don’t get me wrong, I have great respect for what America has accomplished as a nation and what America can accomplish is unquestionable. But their day-to-day decision making skills seem to be driven by moronic YouTube influencers, and that will not end well for anyone.There’s no argument that we will both suffer the fate of uncontrolled immigration and incompetent politicians bent on their own agendas which are not in line with that the majority of people want.Biden screwed you, Merkle screwed us.And Ursla von der Leyen is still screwing Europe.As for the Brits and the French that’s nothing new really. Just more and more of the old colonial chickens coming home to roost.But I have to agree, our fates are sealed.

It has gotten much worse. Those in Silicon Valley who make six figures now generally don’t have to worry about HOA fees, just paying the exorbitant rent. The mass exodus from California has not alleviated the housing issue, either, and as the productive leave the worthless “migrants” stream in to help slightly mitigate the population loss. California remains the wealthiest and most prosperous state but it is a house of cards, too, arguably the most tenuous of the lot.

Excellent post, but it’s not chickens coming home to roost, because there’s no logical relationship between “colonialism is evil, let’s stop doing it” and “we have an obligation to let them colonize us.”
The notion that this is the inevitable result of colonialism, that it’s of our own making, is an enemy warfare meme. Germany is not being invaded by an army of vengeful Askari.

                                By colonialism I mean the majority of foreigners who have been migrating into the UK, Netherlands and France over the past 80-years (long before the recent immigration surge) were commonwealth citizens who had the legal right to move to the mother country. As soon as Algerians, Moroccans and Indians had the means and opportunity to leave their shit-hole countries for the West, they did. And in numbers that have been steadily accumulating since then.The results, as we’re seeing in Germany with the Turks (who we invited as guest workers 60-years ago) are not just the odd million who just showed up.These are passport carrying citizens going back two and three generations. Many of whom brought aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. who all set up home, married, and reproduced in greater numbers than the “native” inhabitants.What you’re not hearing about is the immigrants from Bulgaria, Romania and Albania who are all part of the EU and can travel here unrestricted.

This is the problematic bit, but that is not a consequence of colonialism per se, it’s a consequence of a corrupt elite who, at best, wanted cheap labor and at worse, was out to destroy Europe from the start. That’s why Sweden is as mercilessly diversified as Germany and Britain, despite their only colonies being in the Baltic.
These make up the organized gangs that break into our homes, sell drugs, conduct human trafficking, prostitution, etc.
Very important point. The people bombing Swedish cities are Albanians, not Arabs.

                        Many responses possible, but you’re assuming an immigration distribution dolloped carefully across what was originally natural organic growth.
It wasn’t. Chew on the obvious implications of that.
Not just on housing, but schooling, roads, infrastructure, tax bases, social cohesion, etc.
”Deport them!”
Best analogy I can think of is when the Black Plague wiped out 1/3 of Europe, an economic boom that ignited the Renaissance was possible.
Useless eaters is a thing, unfortunately.

                            The economic boom in Europe happened because there simply wasn’t enough labor, so necessity invented the early seeds of the industrial revolution. This had already been in motion before the Black Death, because back then the world ran on meritocracy, the more intelligent and successfully-reproducing fraction was rapidly upwardly-mobilizing themselves out of being tenant peasants (the remainder being low-IQ with a near 100% child death rate), and there were literally not enough warm bodies left to till the fields.

                            I’m not assuming that at all! Put the entire 10 million into one year if that trips your trigger. That’s 3% of the US population, and largely, migrants are larger family size than empty nesters or DINKs or MGTOWs or similar. We should be able to get by with under +2% growth in housing. We couldn’t even do that?????

                        Per one report there are about 100,000 vacant homes in Los Angeles alone, and I would guess most are foreclosures. Lack of physical housing isn’t the problem, and no one HAS to live on the streets (there’s plenty of public assistance). Tolerating vagrants and criminals is the problem (including illegals, who should receive zero public assistance).
However, when it takes $300,000 in permits before you can stick a shovel in the ground to build a single-family home, THAT is a problem for everyone. (Real number from San Francisco, tripled from about 15 years ago.)

                            Not too different here.You can look at the statistics going back 80 years and while there was a massive increase in housing construction after the war, it pretty much plateaued in the late 80’s and has remained relatively stagnant ever since. Especially single family homes.German towns are simply not giving out building permits which is why the majority of homes on the German market are over 30-years old as often the former owners simply died and the heirs want the money. And because Germans don’t tend to upgrade after they move in, no one wants a 1970’s avocado green bathroom and kitchen.Not to mention the plumbing, electrical and heating systems, along with the roofs and windows, generally have to all be replaced. And pray the cellar doesn’t have water intrusion issues!That means you if you can even find one, it’s often a horrible, 30 or 40 year old house for 350,000 Euro which will cost nearly that much again to renovate.And now, thanks to our liberal government, when a house goes up for sale, the township has the first right to purchase it. It’s a new rule used to provide housing for our new “residents” since there is a serious housing shortage Thankfully, German townships don’t have the money they once did, so it doesn’t happen very often.

                I’m not sure we know what living modestly means anymore. Detached 3 bedroom house with a garage, 1/4 acre of unproductive land, getting everywhere by car, buying new instead of fixing/mending old, food from the supermarket, phones, cable subscriptions, etc. And the luxury of moving when the neighborhood goes, like tossing that old pair of jeans wearing thin at the knee. Pretty amazing when you think about it.

                “Home ownership should be attainable for the average American. “Should be, but seems it never will be.  Wife the other day told me she looked up her childhood home in Scottsdale, AZ on Zillo.  She grew up in a bare bones three bedroom home in lower middle class area.  The home was nothing to rave about, but suited the family at that stage of growth and was at that time what we’d call a “starter home” for a young family.  The home she told me was now worth *more* than our current retirement digs here in poorish, Tucson, AZ.  She then remarked something to the effect of it being a dump compared to our home.Realtors here discuss lower level priced “entry” homes as having to be in the lower 30% price of the homes in the community.  The median price in this berg is $330k, while the media *household* income is in the mid $40K.  No young family is going to be able to have their own home, even if they can find one for sale at that price.

                Much of Germany’s pain was inflicted by the GAE through the Ukraine war and denial of cheap energy from Russia via sanctions and the industrial sabotage of Nordstream II. That was courtesy of the same folks behind the deindustrialization of the United States, which was one of the greatest crimes in history up until that time.

                    Germany did this to herself. Never mind the nuclear shutdown and the Energy-Turn, their national Green action plan, but if they’d allowed fracking, they wouldn’t have needed Russian gas in the first place.
Oh, wait, fracking IS legal! For geothermal energy…
You heat that sound like geese honking? That’s the French laughing on their way to the bank: they have two nuclear units on the Rhine, servicing Germany for when their propellers-onna-stick don’t produce, and two on the English Channel doing the same for England.

                        Yep, Germany willingly and knowingly put themselves in this spot. It was not a secret that, sooner or later, it was going to end poorly. The Ukraine war and Nord Stream just sped up the outcome.

                            True in part but they did rely on Russian energy and it worked out well for them.Until it didn’t. Nord Stream wasn’t a bad idea, but to base your industrial sector on Russian goodwill is criminally stupid, because Russia will not always have a president as reasonable, pro-Western and peace-loving as Putin.Few countries have the privilege of resource autarky, but your energy production, at least, should be domestic if at all possible.Germany has plenty of coal, which they’re now re-discovering, and modern coal plants are almost as clean as gas. A coal plant director here in Denmark bragged that the air that came out of his plant was cleaner than when it came in – and it might even be true, except for the Demon Gas, of course.

                                No doubt energy self-sufficiency is the ideal, yes, but a close second is a steady supply no matter how tenuous. Germany had the latter and now has neither. But, yeah, that coal has promise.

                        Let’s just call a spade a spade. The entirety of the West–save, for the most part, the Slavic world–joined hands and walked into a propeller. Germany did much harm to itself, but the BFE exported a self-loathing ideology that made suicide seem lovely.

                        France is on the cusp as well.  Why with nukes?  Because they are not building more, fast enough.  Their plants are aging and reaching end of life.  Their latest planet I read is still not on line after 8 or so years over schedule.  Those with more current info should chime in, but that was my last reading on the situation.

                            Fairly spot on. The renewal of France’s nuclear program relied on the EPR-reactor, which has gone three decades over scheduled development time and was put on ice during the Sarkozy presidency.But a lot of the latest reactor shutdowns during Covid seemed oddly synchronized to be regular maintenance, rather than another way to squeeze the consumers and stymie industry. Normally, you’d have staggered these shutdowns.The good news is that the Swedes and the Dutch are restarting their nuclear industry. Alas, a decade or so back, Sweden made itillegal to conduct nuclear power research, so a lot of their expertise is gone.

The current “climate crisis” is also more German self flagellation. While the US has oil it can’t use, German has plenty of coal we can’t use.
Evidently Dutch cow farts are the latest threat.

            Spot on. It was all fun and games as long as the pain was confined only to the blue collar workers thrown out of work due to deindustrialization. Reality is about to spread upwards and in fact that has started. Watch evictions spun as the solution to the housing crisis, and those burger flippers paid $40 per hour. To be fair to my countrymen, they had little say in these policies but to their shame they went along with them.

                    Been looking at buying a car. First time in well over a decade. Amazed to see what’s happened to European brands. As you mentioned, they’ve become “lease” brands because their quality has fallen so much. Audi and Mercedes are crap – expensive crap, living off of their styling and past quality. BMWs are still reasonably reliable but so expensive to maintain and service that they’re still not worth it. Even more mid-priced VWs are crap and not worth owning. Volvos are worthless as well.And none of them are in the same universe as the Japanese brands. Even BMW’s reliability is only good compared to the Europeans. It’s a joke compared to Lexus or Acura.

                        There’s truth to that. Some years ago, Merkle though “cash for clunkers” was going to improve life for the top three German automakers.
Instead, thrifty Germans bought must less expensive cars from the French, Italians and Japanese to no ones surprise.

                            I was truly shocked by the reduction in quality. Sure, Mercedes and BMWs were always way too expensive, but they were quality cars. Not sure about Audi.
Now, their reliability ratings are average at best and that’s in the first few years of the car. After that, they fall apart. And don’t get into their costs for repairs. Sure, they have styling, but they’re eating their seed corn. It take awhile, but, sooner or later, your reputation matches the quality of the cars. The European brands will be in trouble over time.

                                Part of the reason all the German marques are now lease-mobiles is that the simulation tools for every part in a car are so powerful they can engineer out every last penny.
So, they wind up with 90% of parts that last through the new and CPO lease periods, 9% that get replaced under warranty, and 1% that create a lemon.

                                I have a customer who needed new motor mounts on a 2019 BMW. Very rare for any modern car of any brand to need motor mounts before 200,000 or ten years in service. They weren’t cheap and he paid a pretty penny to have them installed because of stupid, “German engineering.”

                        I have to disagree about BMW reliability. You regularly see horror stories about their engines. There seem to be fewer such stories about Audi and M-B.
Another problem with BMW is their now horrible styling, which is a sop to the Chinese market.
Finally, something called ‘Art Mode’ has no place inside what claims to be ‘The Ultimate Driving Machine.’

                        Compsci:  Just bought a car, and didn’t even consider an over-priced German one.  Way back in late ’80s, I thought my Volkswagen Jetta was the most reliable thing ever.  Now German carsare the vehicle of choice of rappers.  Considered a Lexus GX 460, but didn’t want to pay for 91 octane gas.  We wanted something durable and reliable, with 4 wheel drive and a V6 engine but without all of the newest cars’ excess electronics – went with a lightly- used Toyota 4runner.

                                Seems fine to us – a bit louder than the rav but not enough to bother us.  Handles more like a truck (built on Tacoma frame) but dealer put new tires on and seats are comfortable.  Even in 2 wheel drive it sticks to our curvy roads and handles the 35-40% hills on the dirt road just fine.  We don’t want a cushiony-boat.  I’ve read the limited model has a cushy ride (and 20″ tires) ; we got the SR5 premium (17″ tires) and are quite satisfied.

                            4Runners are bullet proof with a simple, V6 engine. Unfortunately, Toyota is changing the engine to 4 cylinder turbo that will wear out after 100k miles.

Since then I have had a Subaru, and Jsut got a second (used) Subaru.

                                    No doubt, Tacos are the standard.  But 2005-2021 Nissan Frontiers with the VQ40DE V-6 are good stuff.  Manual or auto.  Sending my kiddo off to college with my old Fronty with more than a quarter-million miles on the odo, no worries.  I expect her to get anohter 100k miles out of it before trading it in after graduation.  General maintenance and few things here &amp; there.  Only mods are helper/load-leveling springs in the rear due to sag whilst towing at 100,000 miles and…nothing else.  Mines basic, it has AC and a radio.

                        Have you ever heard of American cars? Try em some time. All current American cars / trucks / SUV’s are over priced, over optioned, over engineered, over complicated, over “moduled” cheaped out piles of scrap same as the Euro’s but on the whole more reliable and less costly both up front and to maintain. I know I fix them for a living. You want a prestige brand at economy car prices, with American reliability.When I say American reliability i mean relative to the prestige Euro brands.

                    We floated Greece for a long time while they happily retired at 55. Who was the fool, eh?Spain, for those who don’t know, is actually the 8th largest automobile producer country in the world. And if they would just stop growing avocados in the desert they wouldn’t have a water crisis.Italy. Well, what can you say. They build Fiats so their spare parts suppliers and repair shops are always busy – is a self promoting economy. Anything good that comes out of Italy comes from the north. But at least in the south the holiday villas are cheap and the food is good!

                I’m not here to defend Germany, Karl can do that, but to claim Germany has no “natural resources” is absurd.  And prior to the general insanity of the “Greens” did quite well.  Additionally, Germany had perhaps one of the most intelligent ways of developing their workforce.  A reasonable and thoughtful bifurcation between those who attend an advanced university education and those who enter the workforce in what we in American call the “trades”.
Karl can elaborate if he cares to spend the time educating yet another ignorant American—and good god we are ignorant of other countries.

                    Thank you. It’s true and the system worked quite well until it didn’t.Unfortunately, just like in America, all that is coming to an end here too. German industries are leaving in greater numbers every year, taking skilled jobs out of the country with fewer opportunities left behind.We all knew the “diversity brings new workers” was BS since none of these people have any useful skills or a work ethic.As you are seeing in States like California, trying to run a successful company in Germany is becoming more and more difficult no thanks to all the additional internal German bureaucracyand now EU involvement. Which is why our eastern neighbors are enjoying a boom in their economies and one of the quiet reasons they don’t want the US or NATO screwing around in their back yards.Great Britain is the European canary, and it’s been decomposing on the bottom of its cage for decades.Cheap Russian gas and nuclear plants only go so far. You can have all the skilled talent and resources you could wish for, but if you’re not allowed to use them, what to do?

                        Here’s today’s example of what you decry.  The AZ Dept of Education has come out with the stat’s on truancy in our public school system.  The numbers of course track the school’s demographics, but the worse, here where I live, are in the 70% range.‘Lot’s of blaming of schools and teachers.  Same old, same old.  But no one mentions the demographics, nor do they question whether or not our system using a “Prussian” education model is suitable for non-Whites (it isn’t).  For example, the lowest truancy in the system is in my neighborhood district at 25%.  Who’d have thunk…. 😉

                        German schools are still pretty good, but due to the numbers of immigrants (including those from old East Block EU countries) they’re trying to cater to, they’re getting worse. Especially in larger cities like Berlin or FrankfurtI remember California was trying to be bi-lingual by catering to Mexican students who couldn’t speak, read or write English. The result was to bring down the education level to the lowest common denominator resulting in local kids getting the short end of the stick.It’s been happening here for a while too. But Germans have figured out the solution seems to be move to more rural areas (white flight) which is also happening here too since foreigners prefer to remain in big cities.Just like Paris, there’s no reason to go to Berlin.

                            That is a shame to hear.My son is an engineer and went to a pretty good school here in the USA.   He’s worked in one company since graduation. Your “landsmen” bought his company a while back.  He goes back to Germany every so often for consultation and planning.  He’s now in charge of North American operations.He remarks that your (German) “technicians” are often better/more knowledgeable than his/our degreed engineers!  Indeed, he never knows whom he’s talking to wrt their education level unless he reads all their title goobly gook Germans are so enamored of—like “Herr Doctor Professor” for academics (always cracked me up).Anyway, thought you should know that.  I never considered such a trivial accomplishment.  The decline here, I accept, but over there it seems more poignant somehow.

                        It’s more the case of bad money driving out good money, with the white guys on the Volkswagen assembly plants being replaced with cheaper substitutes.
The principal is still fairly unadulterated, with miscegenation rates much lower than in America.
For now.

Also true. But we’ve been winning the propaganda war for the last ten years. If it wasn’t for the massive globalist censorship clampdown, we’d have owned Youtube, Twitter and Facebook by now.
In the noughties, Jared Taylor mailed photocopied newsletters to a few thousand subscribers, today he has millions of followers.
We’ve crippled Hollywood, Jewstream media and the uniparty. We’re winning this war, gentlemen, but Rome wasn’t burned in one day.

                    Not for long I believe.  Last I read, Germany—as does the USA—has a slightly higher percentage of the non-White population at the prime ages of early youth through marriage.  This being due to Merkle allowing that 1.5M alien invasion a couple of decades ago.  Those with more knowledge, speak up.
Demographics is destiny.

                        Not far from the truth. But as I commented earlier, the 1.5M was just the part we all see (tip of the ice burg). Foreigners have been here since after WW2 and have been marrying and breeding ever since. White Europeans, who generally don’t rely on social welfare, tend not to have kids for various reasons. But regardless, the demographics speak for themselves.

                        I hate to admit it, but the Germans stole steel technology from the Brits who were world leaders in steel production.
But once we figured it out we did what we have a history of doing with new technology – started a couple of world wars.
You should all be thankful we’re no longer technically innovative! 🙂

                            The Germans did some original work in chemistry, which is why people interested in the subject for about 100 years or learned German. The invented many of the modern color dyes, etc.The English were hardly beneath “borrowing” technology either.

                            What a decline.  I remember visiting Canada’s expo 67.  We had to go to the German pavilion.  Why, to see the endless variety of machine tooling they made.  Beautiful.  Most such stuff was no longer made here and what was used were old WWII vintage.  Excellent for their day, but of first generation wrt production efficiency.  No, Germany machinery was the future at that time.  A few years later, Japan came on the scene heavy.

            While the majority of us rent our homes
Majority of Europeans own their homes. The only outliers are Switzerland, Germany and Austria and even there it’s very close.
Renting for life is weird. It results in government goons expelling hapless German pensioners from “their” homes to make room for migrants. It makes renters vote for leftist parties that regulate the rental market, while their policies also change the German neighborhood to a Turkish or Afghan or African neighborhood.

                Used to live in Germany. Never understood their lack of desire to own a home. Even weirder, renters would fix up their rented apartments, painting, fixing electrical, etc., all on their own. It was bizarre.

                                Very true! If you rent or buy a home in Germany, there will not be a kitchen and no lights in the rooms either when you move in.
Only unless you make an agreement with the previous tenants and offer to buy their old kitchen since they are legally required to take it with them. Why? Germany!
To be honest, it’s quite stupid really considering what a kitchen costs these days – plus a new stove, oven, dishwasher and refrigerator. It makes no sense.
At least it keeps the kitchen manufacturers busy.

            Americans *are* poor, but they don’t have to be.  More trees than Canada, more oil than Russia, more coal than China, and more agriculture than Southeast Asia.  Get rid of the invaders and the regulators and it would be a new age of the manufacturing barons.  The fact that we don’t to that makes poverty a choice.

                Control of energy and food is the goal of those who want to enrich themselves and subjugate and genocide the Heritage white population. The totalitarian oppression that is spreading indicates those who want this to continue intend to keep an increasingly poor white population from changing that dynamic.

                Run well America would be very rich indeed. Argentina is a lesson here because it’s a smaller version of the same situation, a country blessed by nature. Argentina started squandering its advantages decades before America did but it shows how crazy politics can completely negate natural advantages. There are no signs the other half of America understands any of this which is a bad sign

                    Argentina, where I’ve been living for 20 years now, has a different “heritage” population than did the Anglophone countries and in large measure the squandering has been due to that plus the financial parasites of global infamy realizing that the Argentine population of yore was as easy to befuddle as the present USA population seems to have become; it just took longer. And yet, the present government here seems to be making sincere and somewhat successful efforts at purging bureaucracy, a good start.

                The US does not have more trees than Canada, though it does have a larger variety of forest-types.But what forests remain west of the Mississippi (after a century of industrial-scale logging) are critical for preserving watersheds, and those are being lost to fire at a dizzying rate.  Things are getting hotter and drier and have been for a couple of decades now.  But don’t take my word for it, just ask a wheat farmer in Montana.This is why the notion of some sort of western redoubt for tens of millions of white people in the northern Rockies is idiocy.  There is simply not enough resources to support that many people.The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing conservatives that ecological literacy was code for marxism.

                    Baloney! There are plenty of examples of private landowners that have changed their land management practices, and see a huge turnaround. Same with Kenya. There are also plenty of examples of landowners continuing the same-old same-old management practices of the last couple centuries and turning it to sage and prickly pear.
Google something called “holistic range management” and learn something rather than spout decades-old talking points.

                “More trees than Canada, more oil than Russia,”This is categorically false.  The US oil reserves are much smaller.  Probably less trees too.The high US oil production (though we are still a huge net-importer of oil despite what you may hear on fox news) is artificial in a sense.  It’s tight oil which requires huge amounts of money and only produces a lot of oil for the first 12-18 months.  1/2 the wells are unprofitable.  So many oil companies have declared bankruptcy in the various tight oil plays around the country.  I’ve read (from pessimists like Gail the actuarial) that the North Dakota tight oil has lost money overall.  She may be a pessimist, but she doesn’t pull stuff out of her rear.Even if it were profitable, the harder oil is to produce, the less you get out of it by definition. We have thousands of wells with nodding donkeys producing a barrel or so a day.  As the difficulty in producing it rises, the EROI goes down.  Russia has its own particular problems, but their production is probably a lot easier than ours and they have a lot more.From the EIA“U.S. crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves increased 9% from 44.4 billion barrels to 48.3 billion barrels at year-end 2022”Again, the EIA“Russia’s proved oil reserves were 80 billion barrels as of January 1, 2024.”I don’t know what they mean by “proved” because that could be p10 or p90 and that would be a huge difference.

            Americans believe they are somehow “entitled” to home ownership because it’s a “right”It should be. Not only because muh rights (which, for once, oughtn’t be in scare quotes) but because national security: if you own your home, you own a little bit of the country and that subtly changes your perspective on matters of the Mutterland, because you suddenly have to think in terms of keeping the neighborhood nice and white, if you don’t want your house to depreciate in value. Renters don’t care about the neighborhood because they have no ownership to it.Home ownership rate in Singapore: +92%

                    Tangentially to this, I’ll take a speculative stab at the low German home ownership rates: If you have a strong sense of living in your ancestral homeland, you don’t need to buy a home to feel like you have one.
If your sense of belonging springs from the notion that a home is something that needs to be wrestled from the wilderness, or won in competition with other tribes, ownership becomes more important.

                            The Anglo-Saxons, despite being of German origin, evolved differently on that island.Or perhapsbecauseof their German origin. Britain always had a smattering of Brythonic and Celtic natives living in the fringe areas, a perpetual reminder that the A-S are foreign invaders.There are no remnants of the tribes that lived in Germany before the Germans came, nobody to tell them “you took this land from us.”This ties on to the difference between implicit and explicit nationalism: if your country is named after your tribe, rather than vice versa, you don’t need much parading and flag-waving and allegiance-swearing, and lapel-pin-wearing to convince the people they are part of a nation, that their country is their inalienable homeland.Copypasta warning! American journalist Lothrop Stoddard wrote thusly sometimes in the twenties:To understand America, you must dispossess your mind of the idea that there is an American people at all, as we understand people in Europe. To be a ‘people’ is the dominant ideal of the American, an ideal which they claim with all appropriate fierceness to have realized, knowing all the while they they have done nothing of the sort, and that their only hope of realizing anything of this kind is to stop immigration, do away with their present social system and then wait five centuries for events to develop.If you took the whole population of Europe, mixed it roughly in a mortar, added a certain flavouring of Africans, Asiatics and the like, crushed it with your pestle and scattered the result thinly over the Continent, you would have something closely approximating to America.It would, however, more closely approximate to a ‘people’ than do the Americans at present, for instead of being properly mixed, they are divided into ethnographic strata, which only touch at the edges.America tries to forget this, and succeeds by vigorous newspaper propaganda in making Europe forget it, because in these stirring times it is well to belong to a ‘united people’.

                            It’s not clear we’re of near German origin.English shares some words with German. It also shares a lot of words with Latin and French.There is a Northern European viewpoint that is closer to each other than Southern Europe. But ultimately, WWI and WWII was the English and the Germans duking it out for world domination. (Hint: The Jews won). Less than 100 years ago, people were pretty aware that Germans &lt;&gt; English.

            Germany was doing very well until Merkel and the Eurocrats decided to flood the country with ill-behaved migrants, sign on to the USA’s proxy war against Russia, and wreck the energy industries with Green idiocy. The future for the stolidBürgerinandBürgerdoesn’t look much better than that of their American counterparts.
Too bad. I lived in Germany for 15 years and am fond of the country and it’s people.

                    It certainly didn’t help that Germany was split in two, and the functional half that worked and produced and made the country wealthy ended up paying for the other half after the reunification.
Not to mention we were also busy working to pay off our war debts for both wars.
Imagine what Germany could have done on a commercial, economic and scientific level if we hadn’t wasted blood, treasure and brain power on two pointless wars.
(Tongue in cheek) America would still be trying to figure out how to put a man on the moon.

                        Germany screws itself every few years. On a roll from 1871 to 1914, Just starting recover until 1939, knocked flat and divided in 1945, then a pretty decent recovery followed by reunification in 1991. Things going well until Merkel’s Millions of Male Muslim Migrants, the astonishing stupidity ofdie Energiewendeand joining the US in its sanctions war on Russia.
The Germans just must need to be beaten down when things start to look up.

            Best place to put this comment is behind Karl, but applies to many that follow him.  Karl is correct—credit is the problem, or at least a big part of it.  I was a youngster living with a single parent when we (mother) received (1960’s) an unsolicited bank credit card in the mail.  The limit on it was $300, which was greater than her *monthly* take home pay.  I remember sitting at the table with her as she wondered what the hell is this thing?  Heretofore, we have never seen a credit card, but had heard “rich people” used them.We were poor, but not that poor by community standards and had no debt outside of a house payment, which was comparable to typical rents of the time.  We lived simply and adequately.  If we wanted something outside of daily needs, we saved.  Fortunately, that understanding was ingrained at her age and she never used the card for unplanned, impulse purchases.  When she died, she had no debt.  None, zero, and a somewhat large estate for one of her class.A few years later, I attended university and one of the first things encountered were solicitation areas for incoming students where banks were signing up these 18 yo’s to receive credit cards with limits of unsecured credit up to $500.  Might as well have a table and sell illicit drugs to such “minds of mush.”One can only imagine how much better off the average person would be *without* the hidden tax of interest on all those credit card purchases they made throughout their lives.  Indeed, the typical decision making process on sales here has been (for decades now), “can I make the monthly payment”—not, “can I afford the item”, or even if the item is necessary, useful, or affordable.Credit allowed us to live beyond our means.  The GAE and dollar world reserve currency allowed us to pass much of those (hidden) costs onto the world at large.Karl is not alone in his understanding—even some fat Americans understand this scheme as well!

                Great comment and thanks for the reminder that widespread consumer credit is a relatively new disease. I’m younger than you but there was no table set up to peddle credit cards when I entered University. It may be that where I went to school was poorer and a higher credit risk (when that mattered).
Consumer credit is poison.

                    I remember the first time I saw someone buying groceries with a credit card (early 1980’s).  I was fairly shocked as we always either paid with cash or check up to that time.  Now, it’s pretty much the opposite.  Times have changed and not for the better.

                It’s been awhile since I purchased a new car, since my 14 year old Honda keeps cranking out miles like it’s new.  But I recall car salesmen used to negotiate a monthly payment you could afford rather than haggling over the purchase price.  I’m not sure if that is still a thing.

                    I can’t be sure either, but I assume it is *the* thing still.  I have reached a point in my life, the end point obviously, where such a purchase can be done in cash.  Albeit, the last several cars *were* on credit or loans simply because the car companies offered 0%!  Even with the EV’s as of a few months ago (7-8% then charged for car loans) when I bought one.This was a somewhat better deal than selling investments, and no, out the door price was discussed first, payment discussion after the deal was made. (Although today’s market news makes one think twice.)  It is difficult to tell young folk just how much freedom there is in having cash in the bank so to speak rather than simply loans being serviced.  As Karl said, everyone wants to live above their means via credit.Here’s a great anecdote.  Daughter graduates from college and begins work at hospital.  She moves into first apartment with other millennials in the complex. She has the car we bought her 8 years back.  She buys nothing but clothing outfits for work.  She saves her money.  The complex parking lot is “filled” with brand new cars.  She stands out as the one junker in the lot.  One day we visit and parked next to her junker was aLamborghini!  This particular millennial boy/man was known to her and managed to buy a $250K car when he landed his first job!  Maybe he was rich, but then why live in a relatively dumpy apartment complex?  Sigh….

                        Around here (Western Oregon), it’s Teslas. My neighborhood has lots of apartment complexes and you always see tons of those damn things in the parking lots or parked out front. I think part of what drives it is that this is tree-hugger land and they need to be seen “saving the planet”. Between the crippling rent and the crippling payment on the Tesla, these people will never save anything. I’m sure most of them have huge student loans too.

                    Because we weren’t sure when the insurance check for our wrecked carwould clear, we applied for a car loan.  USAA offered us their lowest rate for a 36 month loan, but also includedrates for a 72 month loan.  I cannot imagine paying on a car for 5 years. Fortunately the check cleared and we had enough additional cash on hand to pay in full and get an excellent out-the-door price.  Fwiw, the two dealers we visited, in two different states, were almost empty.  And one additional place that wouldn’t budge on price over the phone still has the vehicle we were interested in for sale, albeit at $800 less than they did a week ago.

                        Can’t go wrong with a 4runner. We got my wife a 2018 model in brand new for a great deal (through a dealer friend).  It’s fully off road equipped and is great for long trips.  Gas mileage is great.  It is of course paid for.  I bought a Ford Bronco in February.  I refuse to have a car loan so I paid cash.  It’s excellent.  We are planning on moving rural in a few years and we will be needing the capable trucks.  If I don’t ever have to buy another car again I won’t.

                            Tired Citizen:  We got a 2017, with 50k miles, for a great price. In pristine condition, with the heavy duty rubber mats and brand-new tires – and dealer threw in the tonneau cover at ourrequest.  We were looking at a 2019 off-road model (about 3 hours away in the opposite direction of where we bought one) but it was red, and the dealer wouldn’t budge on the almost $36 k price.  Today it’s listed for $34,950.  If they had been willing to bargain they might have had a cash sale.  Their loss.

            LOL Karl went to the jugular!To be fair, no lies detected, Americans have been propagandized for decades into entitlements that apparently do not need people to work hard to be built. Europeans, not being perfect, have been put in an economic diet that almost mimics the difference in bodies between Americans and Europeans.We have enjoyed the benefits of cheap energy and having great academic institutions and a job market that can use the best talent around the world for decades. But the party has been ending for decades. It starts at the bottom but it starts going up.We need to wise up about how America is about merit and the shameless use of cheap energy, plus stealing brains that want to be rewarded for their natural gifts. And a strict immigration policy that keeps out the orcs. But we need to starve the gay communist federal government to restart the old USA. We need to restore the republic we could not keep!

No. We need to cut out the whitest homeland possible and learn from the mistakes of the old republic, which were manifold.

Disney and Starbucks are in the EU too.  Not to mention Disneyworld gets a lot of European visitors.

                I will grant you Disney Paris has done very well despite a very slow start. But that’s due to difference in culture and if you understand that, it explains why they put it in France. Because it would have been a total disaster in Germany.Walmart is a good example of what doesn’t work everywhere. It works great in the USA (my favorite after Bass Pro) but here in Germany, total failure. However American fast food is very popular in Germany with McDonalds, Burger King and KFC leading the way.CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE US TACO BELL???Starbucks is generally in train stations where only the very desperate drink that black liquid they call “coffee”. No self respecting Italian would be caught dead in one. 😉

                        To be fair, as we did with steel production, we learned how to do concentration camps from the Brits during their Boer war.

Everyone conveniently forgets that America had concentration camps in the 20th century at the same time the Nazis had them.  We rounded up the Japs and some Germans and Italians, took all their stuff and sent them to concentration camps.  We were forcibly sterilizing people for eugenic reasons into the 1970s.  I think the last court ordered sterlization was in like 1978, but I don’t recall for sure.

The endless chatter about Yatzees is the gift of Jewish governance and the intersection of Boomer fascination with WWII that keeps on giving. God willing, my children will able to talk coherently about evil and 20th century history. Right now society babbles like the History Channel on continuous loop about nothing. H man bad!!!  Okay…

                    IDK, I think “deserve” is too strong a word.  Despite the voters being fed nonstop propaganda and have their voting choice severely limited, it’s not like we the voters haven’t tried stopping them.I just hope what is going on in the UK expands rapidly to all of the UK.The elite have no fear of the Real Brits, or in the US,  the Real Americans. Fear of prison used to hold them in check. Now that fear is gone.  They need to fear either lady justice or the people. They fear diversity in both countries.  The loudest wheel gets the grease.

                That is not completely true. Much is exaggerated when comparing/computing our “taxes” and what we get for them. I no longer fall for this line from our elites.For one, you have certain benefits like health care often included in the Euro tax rate, such as it may be. We do not.Second we often conflate in that we have several large taxing entities in many American jurisdictions. I was born in NYC. My father, who lived and died there, was plagued by income tax from City, State, and Fed’s. Added up to a 50%+ rate for most of his life.When I retired early from university, the burden of health care fell directly upon me. State health insurance for retirees costs were well over $1000 per month. Didn’t go down until Medicare at 65.It’s not as simple as folks would have you think to get an apples to apples comparison to our European cousins.

                By the time you add up federal, state, local, sales, property and God knows what other taxes, we are probably not that different.  Toss in “hidden” taxes like paying for health care and higher ed, and we may actually be worse off.  Comparing what one pays in versus what one gets out, who knows who is better off.

And if you’re from a less prosperous part of Europe, you came here with more of a depression-era mindset. You save because you never know what’s around the corner or who’s going to invade your country. I am thankful that I grew up with that mentality.

        “The market” is a Boomer Ponzi scheme that has been institutionalized as a national retirement program. It is clear that it responds not to “free market” incentives, but to political decisions and government policies — interest rates, housing credits, MFN deals, tax breaks, tax-sheltered investment accounts.I stayed out, and I feel like I got fucked. I applied the basics of sound financial decision-making — saved money, no debt, no impulse buys, used cars, no vacations, tried to get a steady 3-5% interest rate on savings.But if you weren’t in on the scam it turned out that didn’t do much for you. I always thought that pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. Stupid me. Pure greed and fecklessness became national policy for three decades. When the “market” crashes people are going to scream for government to bail them out. And it will, just like in 2008. That is how socialism comes to America.The fat Boomers are dependent on the stock Ponzi and on offshoring jobs to China to keep the share prices up. The Millennials who cannot afford a half-million dollar house are not going going to keep bidding up Tesla and Apple share prices to ridiculous levels to pay for the Boomer retirements.This cannot end well. The Democrats are probably salivating about the prospects of seizing 401(k)s and converting them to government-guaranteed crypto retirement pensions.

            The seizing pensions has been proposed for decades now, by some economists no less.  It’s the conversion of paper script, or other liquid assets into crypto that’s “interesting”.  In any event, it was shown years ago via some simple paper and pen scribbles that such seizure would not cure what ails the government fiscal problems for more than a year or two.

        One thing to keep in mind is that federal govt tax receipts are highly tied to asset prices. Even without a recession, govt deficits increase significantly when the market corrects. If you throw in a recession – and thus have a big increase in govt spending – the deficit will explode.
Outside a catastrophic war, govt debt is what will ultimately bring down GAE. A recession with a crash in asset prices will push forward that timeline.

        The trouble is Jerome Powell is not in a rate cutting mood and has made this clear.Powell predictably has been tagged as the fall guy. Bill Ackman last night commented that Powell had been too slow to earlier increase interest rates and too slow to cut them now. Yes, ethnicity plays a role here, and left unsaid is the world economy was a tinderbox in the aftermath of the Covid madness and inflation remains a massive systemic problem that threatens to get incredibly worse. Powell will be pressured to cut rates by more than the expected .25 percent, and if he does, the price shocks only will accelerate and prove him right.Dump overvalued Harris stocks. Short sell Trump presidency II popularity stocks. This portends to be deep and prolonged. As we see in Britain, besieged Westerners are ready to revolt, too, and winning the presidential election will be the equivalent of getting extra dessert with the last meal prior to execution. Also pray, if you are so inclined, for peace because folks in the GAE are likely to do anything to break their fall no matter how stupid.

                Z and others I read had commented on the apparent failure of the predicted repercussions from the lockdowns to emerge. While it doesn’t account for all of what is happening at the moment, some of this is just the sugar rush of liquidity poured into Western economies from 2020-2023 burning off. Basic economics didn’t change but they did got delayed a bit. This also shows the complete uselessness of hypothetical UBI over the long term, which doesn’t mean Western governments won’t try it anyhow.

                            I would think the very high interest of the early 80s was what kicked it all off.  People were loading up with credit card debt and then refinancing their homes at the new lower mortgage rate. My parents did this several times over the period of 1980-2005.  That’s what 25 years of falling rates did or at least it appears that way to me.  The problem is, you eventually hit a point where it is already too low.Since we started outsourcing everything, all the talent is retired and no new talent was behind them.  There was supposed to be some chip manufacturers building chip factories in America, but they cannot find the talent in the US to work in them.  I would think we don’t even have the machinists or even machine operators to work in a regular old factory making blenders or something.

            The Fed has just been following short-term treasury rates.  Given that a rate cut should be in the offing since after years of stability the rates have dropped.  If he doesn’t cut in the next few weeks then maybe there is some grand plan, but my bet will be on a rate cut because just mirroring the market is a pretty safe way to play.

        I think the stock market will be fine. It’s still the best way to get this excess money out of the economy. There is still too much money in the economy which is why inflation has been so sticky (yes, despite what the media tells you, the inflation rates would be unacceptable in any other time). The stock market bubbles are great for the people in charge and gets money out of the system. I still think they have an interest in doing so.The real problem is that our Greatest Ally is committing blatant and illegal acts of war against a government with a large military and lots of regional force protection. Israel has gone completely rogue and has a bloodthirsty, power-mad maniac in charge, and we have no idea who is in charge in DC to manage the situation. In any other time, the President would have given one if not multiple addresses to the nation, but we don’t have a President. The VP, and nominee for President, isn’t out there talking about it either. She’s talking about zoomer memes. Everyone is just out to lunch. It’s a bizarre and uncertain situation, and the one thing that is really bad for the stock market is uncertainty.

        I don’t know if this is the foothills of the big crash but it has to come. The Ukraine war sped up the revelation to the perpetual chumps that Western economies don’t produce very much tangible value. A country with a nominal GDP the size of Italy outproduced the entire west in artillery shells and other weapons. There’s a latency built in but eventually that made people realize that moving money around on screens is not producing value. It didn’t help that one of the most visible genuine products of the US, Boeing airliners, started dropping doors and wheels left and right. A real “correction” would be a devastating tsunami

        When on that Dow-Jones historical chart, I untick both “inflation-adjusted” and “log scale” I am struck by how closely the raw numbers follow the national debt.
Of course, I’m old enough to remember when the national debt hit a billion and everyone was in a panic. But then it was still real money. Now it’s not even imaginary money, it’s square root of -1 money.

        I think everyone’s being a little quick to jump on the Doom Wagon. Yes, we’re screwed in the long run, but as I type this the Dow is only down about 1,000 points. That seems like a lot given that a lot of us remember Dow 1,000 and Dow 10,000. But today, 1,000 points is 2.5%. It hasn’t even tripped the breakers (7%, then 13%).The Government Party simply will not permit conditions that would allow the man they just tried to murder to win in November.The best advice always and everywhere is to keep your head. There are a lot of opportunists waiting to prey on us all.  A sudden panic run in stocks strongly benefits people with the available cash to buy low.  So maybe all the “news” is just a way to drive a panic to then cash in on,Odds are that nothing much will happen. All of this crap is intended to freak people out which makes it easier to take their money and send their kids off to yet another war. So don’t give them that power.Do smart things: pay off your debts, and if you have savings, move it someplace that isn’t stocks. Most company 401K programs have a variety of options that aren’t all large cap stocks. Clear out that credit card. That sort of thing.In times of uncertainty, focus on what you can control.

                Hunting is the easy part if there’s a population die-off big enough to make subsistence hunting a viable strategy.  It’s the butchering and storage that matters so you don’t accidentally kill yourself by spoiling the meat.
Where I grew up, there were lots of dead deer in November…but nearly everyone took their carcass to the local butcher.
Now there’s a guy who will make bank in a TEOTWAWKI scenario.  Which this isn’t.

            If the “government party” had tried to kill Trump, he’d be dead. That is, if it was the same “deep state” who’d been out to get him since 2016, he’d be dead. I’m leaning more to the Biden circle specifically as the source of the plot, and it was a rush job, to save his presidency that was under assault. If he could get rid of Trump, then he could fend off the coup against him. Biden hadn’t expected to face a coup. He was more blindsided by it than anyone. The fool thought they actually loved him. So in desperation, with barely 2 weeks to work with, “he” hatched this plot. “Crooks” was just the best they could come up with on short notice.  Supporting data points: his withdrawal (falling on his sword for failure) only 1 week later. Physician Jill’s nearby event drawing away resources. Blackrock connection of “Crooks.” The Biden white house is a Blackrock white house after all.Any attempt to explain what happened has to factor in some incompetence, whether of the USSS, the shooter, or both. In an Occam’s Razor sort of way, trying to distill it down to the minimum incompetence required, is how I end up with this scenario. “Crooks” was no doubt better trained and more skilled than we’ve been told, but in the moment he failed, and due to the rushed nature of the job, there was no second shooter or more elaborate plan. The USSS wasn’t so much incompetent but deliberately misallocated, misdeployed, and miscommunicated by someone in charge. The incompetence belonged mostly to “Crooks,” who I doubt just lucked into finding the one unguarded roof. And also to his handler(s) who hoped/believed that this one man alone would get it done.

                The Government Party’s main strategy is to do bad things but not be seen doing it.  Nordstream, Moscow theater, rigged elections, etc.
They used apathy to try and kill him.  And they cratered his security to give the appearance of a lone wolf taking advantage of incompetence.
The muted response by both wings of the Government Party and its media reflect a government that is stunned that they missed.

                1,033 pt sell off is not a crater.  It’s barely a pothole.  Low 30,000’s?  Ok, that’s a correction, but given how hyperinflated the market is, still not a crater.  It would only erase the “gains” since Trump left.

                Judging by their ham fisted assassination attempt, I’m not the one overestimating their abilities. But I understand your point.i just meant they’ll pump whatever they need to into the economy to make it look like things are fine. Then let it collapse if Trump prevails.Zman writes a lot about the collapse in competence. The problem with stupid people is they think they can control all outcomes. I think they’ll be proven wrong, again. But I don’t think the system will implode.They’ll just push the easy button again because the Fed’s paradoxical dual mandate says maintaining low unemployment is a Fed responsibility.

        When the ‘market’ went down to 17,000, I waited and got OUT altogether at 33k, locking in earnings and ran. Sure cash gets eaten away by inflation moths BUT it does not have the habit of disappearing overnight, when the criminals take their ‘earnings’ and leave everyone else holding the bag.Life is too short to ‘watch’ your lucre every gdamn day. Who has their focus on money, money, money all the time?Haha, right.Lo and behold this thing called ‘cash’ although also fake and numbers on a screen, grows with the horrors of high interest rates. As for inflation, yes everything costs much more — but IMO the best hedge against that is to buy less. Make more food from scratch. Fix your own damn shit. Let the Normie consumerists take it up the ass. It’s their world.On another note, saw a fat, hunchbacked older woman proudly wearing a tee shirt emblazoned with an American flag and giant words, “I Identify as Vaccinated.”I shit you not.

            By accident, out of what conservatives pretty much rightly diagnose as aversion to “responsibility” and “consequences” and such, the left (or whatever) has stumbled into a great insight, upon which they consistently act whether or not they consciously acknowledge it: Of all things fake and gay, The Economy™—I’d say economicsin toto—is the fakest.The best evidence that antisemitism is irrational, a distorted envy, is that JQ enjoyers don’t accept this revelation. Instead they’re the staunchest defenders of a financial—offinance’s—worldview. See this page. Half of it is wishes to immanentize the libertarian-economic eschatonbecause it will further impoverish normal people.We used to respond to things like that with “Post nose.” Good times.

        These words are scary for those who are unfit to face the coming future of hardship and challenge. For them, whining is the only tool they have for enhancing survival in an environment of existential competition. They produce nothing of value and solely rely on government gibs for sustenance. When resources become scarce, nature has no use for the parasite. DC is a cesspool of parasites. The time is soon approaching when all good men must turn on the light, take off your shoe, and smash the cockroach in the corner.

            It’s a target rich environment these days.  You also have the whole “will Iran attack Israel? / WW3” thing.  And the Left’s collective freak out about Trump’s epic NABJ appearance where his smack down of the ABC reporter was cheered by audience members.
There is a not small number of people cheering as white Britains flee the knife wielding savages.  Serves them right.

        I wonder if you aren’t overly pessimistic Z. Russia had two decades of disorder because they had a LOT of old Soviet baggage to get rid of. Add in thug politics, black markets, massive corruption…and a populace that was used to a relatively low living standard compared to ours.Note that Putler’s fortunes began to change when he ran the jews out of the nation’s finances and corporations out on a rail. He tied the Ruble to gold. He made honest national sacrifices that paid off later. In short – he created a fair marketplace where non-jews and non-westerners could safely invest and expect to see a return. What was the time frame for that? 5 years?All we have for baggage is political correctness. That dies the second the lights go out, and people start getting hungry. America is chock full of businessmen, builders, shakers and movers champing at the bit be heritage Americans.Our turn around *might* be significantly faster than that of the Russians.

                Disagree. Empty stomachs and cold houses in the winter change everything. The widespread anti-white oppression is an inadvertent admission of this but will prove ultimately futile. The pain that is coming will be horrible but will lead to carving out of homelands.

                    How do I trust these whites when I know what they have said about me? They will burn their BLM merchandise and torch the photographs, but we have a problem going forward in many parts of the US where whites have been at each other’s throats for generations. We have been conditioned to hate each other and many do.
Lack of trust in good times must logically entail even less trust in bad times. I don’t know these White Injuns.

Maybe several decades, maybe centuries, and possibly never as it was a unique conjuncture of circumstances that led to the rise of the West. Maybe the unfolding of events will be similar to Miller’s “A Canticle for Leibowitz.”

        Another thing to keep in mind is that the S&amp;P 500 is highly tied to employment via 401ks and target-date funds, which are invested in index funds, mostly the S&amp;P 500 on the stock side. A huge portion of the new money coming into the market – the money that matters – is 401k contributions. Rising unemployment reduces that inflow.Heaven forbid your average Joe start to move their 401k money out of the default target-date fund and into cash or bonds. The last 15 years has seen a huge decline in active stocks funds, i.e., funds with a person deciding whether to buy a stock or not, so there’s fewer and fewer people available to be on the other side of the trade from the index funds. If holders of index funds decide to start selling in even small numbers, it could get ugly quickly as they wouldn’t find enough people to sell to.

                Well, that’s another issue related to index funds and 401ks. The stock market is no longer a pricing and capital allocation mechanism. It’s now a retirement plan for a large portion of the country. That makes the Fed and the govt look at it very differently. They simply can’t let it collapse like in the 1930s or even 2008-2009.Between govt receipts and so many people relying on the stock market, the govt will have to step in to protect it at some point. Maybe they’ll allow a 20% or even 30% drop, but they will intervene to keep it afloat because so many other things – govt debt and people’s retirement – are at stake.

                    If and likely when the government “steps in,” look forde factoseizure and putting the accounts into a non-existent “lock box” for safe-keeping and propping up ESG companies and the MIC. This has been threatened for decades now, and these are the same folks who never let a crisis go to waste.
Also note the threats to tax unrealized capital gains. Seemingly unrelated but the same goal–keeping the grift going longer.

                        401ks are like everything else – if you don’t hold it, you don’t own it.  We took some out to pay in full for the property we bought in 2023 plus a few other debts.  We still have a significant sum remaining, but my husband’s still working so we take quite a tax hit on withdrawals, and his employer only recently started offering a decent match to 401 with holding, so he wants to wait.  It’s a gamble.

                            The problem is that once you purchase equity stakes held in your 401(k) you no longer have any money… you have spent the money and the only way you get it back is for someone to buy the equity stakes from you at the same or higher price that you purchased it for.It is the very definition of the Ponzi.Conversely if you hold paper money in the bank it is only as valuable as the government says it is, and if the government wants to print more paper then they devalue your current paper holdings.Unless you hold an asset that continually generates revenue, like rental property, you are pretty much at the mercy of the government and can get screwed at any time.Paying for the property in full was a good choice, as long as you can pay the property taxes you can keep it and use it, it is a tangible asset.

                                It’s not a Ponzi, but the rest is pretty much spot on.
A Ponzi would be something like Social Security.

                            It absolutely is a gamble. As to the things you can actually hold or touch, I suspect the proposed unrealized capital gains tax is focused on those, particularly the real estate the Boomers and early X’ers intend to pass onto children and grandchildren. It really is a matter of holding and hiding now to the fullest extent possible. There is no easy solution, but you do have to roll your eyes when people discuss, say, gold and then go on to explain it is in the form of tokens/securities/funds. I mean, really, they own at best hypothetical gold, which means when the State decides, they own nothing.Along these lines, I expect the elite schism that seems to have formed is because of a similar mentality that has been somewhat disabused. These Clouds seem to have realized that the Gramscian-liked Marxism that’s all the rage will now include economics as well as social life. Who could have seen that coming?

                Overtime disappeared at the beginning of the year with no prospect of any more.  I am applying for part-time jobs now and intend to work until I am 72 at least. Thank God at 66 I still have a strong back.   Retirement may never happen, but I have a  large garden and orchard and will probably be raising chickens again in the backyard.   I had them before in wealthier times in a trendy West LA neighborhood; this time the set up will be more rustic.   Watch for backyard swine to make a comeback and I don’t mean pet miniature potbellied pigs.  I remember eating squirrel when I was a kid and I didn’t like it, but the neighborhood tree rats are looking sort of good.I

I would be very interested to know how and when that began.

                        I think people always retired in an sense—unless they died first—it’s the how, where, and when that’s changed.  I bet it was the same in Germany.  The old used to do what they could as they got old and were part of an extended family within which the found support.  Around the Great Depression, things started to perceptibly change for oldsters, who—unable to work, became a distinguishable older class.  Hence FDR’s initiation of Social Security.People get old, has been forever.  At some age the best you can do is take care of your bodily functions.  Now if you are talking about the able bodied person choosing to do no productive work, well that’s probably something only in rich societies and after affluence came about.  It is also going to decline as affluence declines.  Still, it doesn’t give me any peace of mind to see oldsters working in occupations that usually employ the young.  Seeing grandma come over to bus my table makes me get up to help her.  🙁

                            Might be true of city slickers, but it’s a fairly new phenomenon to rurals. Since one of the kids is taking over the spread, dad takes it a bit easier, takes the old pickup out to fix fence, and is available when you need to move the cattle. Though he will be driving his pickup, not riding a horse.
Still is that way for a lot of people.

                        People did always slow down with age and eventually stop working. That’s true of even slaves in ye olde days. The concept of a 20-30 year vacation until you died is a recent development, only supportable by the industrial revolution and large scale governments. That’s the 20th century in the developed world.Retirement as a concept came to the US during WWII. Wage controls were put in place during the war. Corporations started to offer pension plans, conveniently timed for the first attack of a men eating on industrial food their whole lives. Depressed wages and keep “company men” was attractive for several decades in the 20th century.Social security plus pensions made retirement viable for the American masses. I suspect however, the concept dies with the Boomers.

                            I was going to say official retirement came in with FDR’s Social Security, a scheme to get the young ones off the farm and into the city factories owned by FDR’s buddies.Government subsidised wage suppression that broke the extended family and family farm model of a predominately agricultural America.  (Even our school year was timed to the harvest season.)The first SS check was mailed in 1944, wasn’t it?That would put the scheme right in line with WWII wage controls and corporate pension plans.Related, old age state pension was invented in Germany by the great Bismark.  German policy supported labor, Anglo policy exploited it.

                    I prefer hunting deer to squirrels, it’s a lot of work to drag and cut it but once you have it cut and wrapped and frozen you have meat for a long time. You have to kill and skin a LOT of squirrels to match what you get out of even one small deer. Too much hassle.
Which reminds me, I should thaw some venison for tomorrow, killed five of the bastards last year…

                        I’ll probably never eat another squirrel in my life. Venison is great, but I think it was very rare in the 30s and 40s Tennessee and Illinois when my parents grew up, so it wasn’t something I was exposed to growing up. I’ve known plenty of folks since that hunt deer in Texas, Colorado, Kansas, Mississippi— all over.  I am happy some of my nephews are hunters and if my daughters fell for hunters . . . let’s just say that would be a plus.   Bride price denominated in a decent currency: venison jerky!

                “Retirement more or less is a thing of the past even now.”
Yes, very sad—and dangerous.  The aspect of what Citizen talks about, the Fed’s propping up of market to avoid people starving in retirement, seems not to useful to those retiring with *no* real assets except a bit of equity in a house and maybe $100K in the bank.  Every analysis I’ve seen says this description—or worse—applies to 80-90% of the population.

                    Mass retirement is a 20th century concept. The general human condition is to work until you can’t work any more and then ask the kids for help.

                        That was very much the case in Germany and Austria and probably Switzerland too. Until at least the 1940’s, on farms anyway, the old people would move out of the main house and their kids would move in. They’d build a little addition onto the side of the family farmhouse and the old folks stayed there until they died. This is one of the reasons many really old German farm houses are so large. As the family grew, so did the buildings.I’d have to dust off some history books and read up on German retirement scheme and when exactly it became a part of regular society. I would guess probably like in the US and the UK slowly became a society norm, sometime after WW1 once the depressions were over.Prior to WW1, I believe the only people to receive what we would call retirement benefits (aka State pensions) were State employees and members of the military.

                            Okay, why am I not surprised. Quick Google and I got this from the American Social Security website!The German PrecedentGermany became the first nation in the world to adopt an old-age social insurance program in 1889, designed by Germany’s Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck.The idea was first put forward, at Bismarck’s behest, in 1881 by Germany’s Emperor, William the First, in a ground-breaking letter to the German Parliament. William wrote:“. . . those who are disabled from work by age and invalidity have a well-grounded claim to care from the state.”One persistent myth about the German program is that it adopted age 65 as the standard retirement age because that was Bismarck’s age. In fact, Germany initially set age 70 as the retirement age (and Bismarck himself was 74 at the time) and it was not until 27 years later (in 1916) that the age was lowered to 65. By that time, Bismarck had been dead for 18 years.Source:https://www.ssa.gov/history/age65.html#:~:text=Germany%20became%20the%20first%20nation,letter%20to%20the%20German%20Parliament.

                                But remember that Bismarck and the Kaiser were trying to undercut (or accommodate, if you will) the Social Democrats. Also recall that employers like Krupp had welfare provisions for their workers before it was enacted as legislation. Provisions that most American workers still don’t have. “Dirigisme” is the word.

                    Try the house and $100K in debt- with no income and $500 left in cash, in an envelope – and now you’re in my ballpark. At least I finally got the 36 year-old beater running, and still have 1200 gallons of water in the house tank. (And, the ditch is full, so grey water for the swamp cooler and flush.)

                Not to pick on you—I know nothing of your situation and past.  However, a common caveat is that if you can’t afford a downturn, you should not have that money in such an asset class.  In other words, if you are retired or just about to be and you depend upon those assets to fund you retirement expenses, you’ve made a financial mistake.My suspicion is that any number of folks today decrying the current downturn are in that position.  I lived through the “dot com” crash and the Great Recession and never missed a beat as I was employed with only a house payment needed.  Raises always went 50/50 into the 401k and into the family coffer.When I retired, it was with pension and no debt of any kind.  Pension was enough to pay bills, so the 401k could “ride the market”.  No change today, except now I have assets on hand to fund bills for a few years if even if the pension goes South.Yes, I’ve been blessed.  Nonetheless, some of the above applies even to those not so blessed.

            I dunno. The fact of a big crash prior to the election (if this materializes into one) would suggest the fix is not in for Kamala. Or at least that the ptb are divided on the matter, which is the way it appears to me.

        As is usually the case, the great transition will take time.
Yeah, but in general things go down a lot faster than they go up.  Including economies.
Why?
Because it is far easier to destroy than build.

        The markets more often than not seem to have a correction in late July-ish since I’ve been alive. My theory has been that this is the time people go on vacation so that lessens activity in the markets, maybe? Could be nothing more than that.

        The DOW actually doubled from its scamdemic 2020 low – fueled of course as has everything since 2008/9 by central bank helicopter money raining from the skies.  35T in debt which no doubt will all be repaid with interest – just like dumb &amp; dumber Jim Carrey….

        There’s a guy I follow (he’s jewish btw), on the basis of whose forecasts I cashed out of the stock market completely back in March, as I posted here at that time. He called the tops and bottoms of the 2020 covid crash almost perfectly, and he did it before anybody had heard of covid. He also at that time predicted that subsequently the SP500 would see a great rally to 4000+. So I did some stock buying at the covid bottom he predicted, which did in fact turn out to be the bottom.For the last year or so he’s been banging the drum that we are near a major long term top in the market, comparing it to 1929, to be followed by a 9-17 year long bear market. Time will tell if he’s been as precise about calling the top numbers wise, but I don’t think that’s all that important. The important thing is to get out of the way of the steamroller. BTW this guy is completely apolitical in his forecasts, nothing about geopolitics, he is 100% about the numbers.According to him (his name’s Avi Gilburt) if you got out today, even after the losses of the last few days, that wouldn’t be a bad thing. But, after the initial decline, down to the low 3000s (we’ve obviously still got a ways to go to get there), there should be a big multi year bear rally back to the upper 4000s (which incidentally would give us a beautiful “head and shoulders”), before the bear market really turns serious. Energy stocks should do well in that time, could be the new leaders instead of silly tech meme stocks. So I am looking at re-entering the market in a few weeks or months to ride that bear rally.

            Maybe you and me read Avi Gilburt differently. I think he has been predicting multi decades stock market crash after S&amp;P would hit about 5500. He has been comparing this incoming crash to the Great Depression in severity and length.

                No disagreement there. Most recently, about a week ago, he said he thought the market “most likely” had one more rally in it to about 5800, but in the same note he said he wasn’t that confident about putting money into it.
It’s been a while since I saw him lay out the bear market rally that should come after the initial crash. The head and shoulders was my inference, not his, but I couldn’t help but notice how that lined up.

                    It’s the national debt.  The deficient was never shrunk, it exploded in 2020, and was never thereafter reduced—indeed, it increased because of Biden paying back his constituents.  That deficit needs to be funded through sale of Treasuries, currently $3T+ yearly.At a certain point you can’t get enough suckers in the GAE, so the Fed buys them.  The Fed buying your debt is the same as taking money from your right pocket and putting it in your left and counting that as an “asset” or increase in wealth.This is not unnoticed by the suckers in the GAE.  They reduce their exposure—even though they need to settle transactions in dollars—they seem to have enough, especially in a recession.  Of course, our enemies do the same and now attempt to invent their own alternative system for exchange, BRICS—which now has dozens of members—joined or in the process of joining.  The point to BRICS aside from escaping from dollars is to make a currency for exchange measurable in something other than the “full faith and credit” of the United States—who has been shown to no longer be sane and therefore reliable.However, all is not lost if you are the Fed’s.  That’s the reason for the hard push on digital currency.  Soon, your own money will be theirs.  Like gold and silver, if you don’t possess it, and who does, you don’t own it.  Beware.

                            Yes, but the added to the baseline thing was that Obama would never allow a fully defined budget to be passed.  That’s right, the USA went the full Obama term on continuing resolutions without a formal budget being decided (IIRC).  Remember the shutdown and near shutdowns under Obama because he’d not sign the Rep budget?  That.

        Dear Z,
Thank you for emphasizing what this country deserves.
For half a century we have focused on giving people what they want (which tends to be the opposite of what they deserve) and it has made Americans into delusional and petulant children.
I say let the poverty come. It is time Americans reconnect with reality and realize what is up and what is down.
