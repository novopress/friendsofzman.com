        The amount of friends who I thought were sane but have gone totally woke over George Floyd is astonishing.  Instagram is full of friends posting BLM posters, praising their kids for protesting, begging for patience as they listen better, etc.  People who I thought were normies are actually too far gone.  Are normies becoming extinct?

            What do these people do for a living? Do they deal with the public? The reason I ask is that the new BLM rhetoric is ‚ÄúSilence is violence.‚Äù People are getting called out for simply not saying anything. So, these people might only be supporting BLM out of fear, to stay on the good side of the mobs, so they won‚Äôt lose their jobs, or customers, or whatever.I personally don‚Äôt care about this now. But if I had to worry about kids and mortgage payments and still had my old newspaper job, maybe I‚Äôd also be paying lip service to BLM. Better to be a phony than be jobless and homeless.

                They are public declarations that 2+2=5 !The Roman Senators offended by Caesar‚Äôs ostentatious fashion crime of wearing only purple, all had a go at stabbing him .Maybe that‚Äôs the point ‚Äì to elicit complicity and implicate oneself in the lie?I too am not in a position where I‚Äôd have to willingly go against my conscience.

                It is better to be a phony right up until some joggers bust your skull open for being white, or rape your daughter for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.I like the salesman/market comparison our esteemed blog host uses. I am a former marketing guy myself, and I see things slightly different.The market has changed. Our enemies are now making fatal mistakes, one after another. Normie now has no choice‚Ä¶ When shitlibs disband police departments to appease the blacks‚Ä¶ And run dementia patients as presidential candidates‚Ä¶ and Normie personally has to deal with the growingly dire fallout from leftist idiocy‚Ä¶ He has nowhere else to go. I am unhappy with letting the left take ownership of our language and telling us what terms we can and can‚Äôt use. If we have to moderate our language for normie and the left, they‚Äôll be moderating everything else too. In fact, that is precisely how I got here‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt take their cultural Marxism anymore.Could it be that the market is so bad‚Ä¶ that the drunken sales guy spewing racial slurs actually looks GOOD to Normie? If it isn‚Äôt now‚Ä¶ It soon will be and no bones about it!Our ancestors were not hateful, sadistic morons. They understood the black man and did what was necessary to control his nastier behaviour problems. Because blacks have low IQ, their justice has to be simple, fast ‚Äì and brutal. When they lynched a black the perp almost invariably needed it. Even black slaves lived better than the wild blacks if Africa.I see vast herds of normies headed our way‚Ä¶and the challenge will be to prevent them from running away with the dissident movement and cucking it as they did with the Tea Party, the Oath Keepers and others.Best of luck to you and the boys, Z.

                    Glenfilthie,I see where you are going with the rejection of self-moderation but I don‚Äôt think the tide has washed in yet. It‚Äôs easy to become comfortable in the harsher language of subjects we know to be true (and even be pleasantly surprised when we discover a normie receptive to our ideas) but dont think for a second that normie won‚Äôt enthusiastically serve you up right now in a last gasp effort to fit in with the new social norms.Yes, there is a hunger growing among Ours for truth and no small amount of disgust for the way things are going‚Ä¶ but it is still the time for delicacy and diplomacy.I would gladly welcome mayhem now for the sake of my children. This is the long struggle though. If we are to have a chance it will be a multi-generational struggle. Our kids and grandkids will not escape it. Patience is Our path. I will not be around to see the end result.

                They practice what 99% of us have been practicing for decades: keeping our true thoughts to ourselves when needed. But now our enemies have changed the rules: a public protestation of piety to the new idols.No brotherhood means we face our fate alone. A family, a home, a career are now at stake and there is no one who can stand with you to push back and do so effectively. We don‚Äôt need martyrs we need warriors.Swallow that bitter pill for you will find it a great motivator. Doing so to simply get along and survive is to die before you‚Äôre dead. Find a way to seek out your natural brothers. Do so sub-rosa. Build yours until you can break theirs.That first step to free yourself from their yoke will be the most difficult. Once you begin, a sense of purpose and a need for action through brotherhood will fill you with an appetite to drive forward. Do so wisely. We don‚Äôt need everybody‚Ä¶just enough willing to see it to the end.

            Normies follow the pack. Safer that way. The problem is, the longer you follow, the more you internalize. Their brains are literally rewiring themselves. Wife shared a verse from 2 peter the other day to help me feel a bit better.And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:‚Ä¶These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.

                    To some degree. I like the poetry of King James. Every translation has its strengths and weaknesses, IMHO. There‚Äôs a lot of theology that is inferred by many of the translations (and don‚Äôt get me started on ‚Äòcommentary‚Äô footnotes ‚Äì it‚Äôs one thing to put the Greek in the note, another completely to ‚Äòexplain‚Äô a passage for the reader).

        My close family has really seen the light after these recent chimpouts. Scenes of blacks burning down cities, taking down historical monuments, wanting to defund the police &amp; whites being blamed for everything has made them terrified but angry at the same time. I think now is the ripe moment for normies to buy into a new political ideology, as you put it. It‚Äôs now or never, if whites can‚Äôt wake up during this tumultuous time, then it‚Äôll never happen I‚Äôm afraid.

                            Yes, it still exists and always will. It is ENORMOUS. Most people don‚Äôt grasp the sheer scale of the thing. Or the fact that it‚Äôs carved of sheer, living granite. It was put up there, so it can be removed, but doing so would cost an enormous sum and would take years. But here‚Äôs how stupid joggers are: A member of the Atlanta City Council‚Äìabout 20 yrs ago now‚Äìsuggested that the carving be sandblasted off of Stone Mountain. No, that carving is not going anywhere, which is not to say they won‚Äôt cover it up somehow, but even that would be a enormous undertaking and would cost Lord KNOWS how much (and would have to be maintained at significant, continuing expense to the state of Georgia), so we can expect that carving to remain, although possibly not to public view.

                They are methodically and inexorably showing us just what they intend to do.  Any and all remnants of bad whytes will be removed ‚Äî first white supremacy, then removal of statues, banning of symbols, and renaming (schools and) military bases.A great proportion of the soldiers ‚Äî enlisted and junior officers come from the old South.  I wonder how they‚Äôll react?Impure thoughts aired are now proscribed.  How long until they justify full life reviews to determine prohibited thoughts and private action?  It is coming.

                    Don‚Äôt be too optimistic about the current crop of military folks. From the first day the enter the service, and continuing daily throughout their careers, they are hammered with the poz. Just recently, I had to sign a Page 13 (generic letter of acknowledgement) that I would not be involved in any way with any WS groups. They intentionally left the definitions vague, but people have been disciplined for joining different white/European/Southern identity orgs.Remember, the US military has always been the proving ground for every left-wing movement. It‚Äôs a captive audience that is very used to doing whatever they are told. Oh sure, many don‚Äôt actually believe it, but they won‚Äôt dare go against it. We all see what happens to those who do.

                    You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs lost when they seriously begin to ‚Äúerase‚Äù the founding Fathers.  Most all of whom are directly or indirectly cursed with the sins of racism and slavery.It never ends.  It began with allowing the creation/elevation of their pseudo hero‚Äôs to the pantheon of national recognition‚ÄîMLB, Chavez, Parks.  Whites were generous in that regard‚Äî‚Äúlet them have their own paid holiday‚Äù‚Äîthey said.But appeasement never ends and only brought more demands as resentment grew. Reconciliation only announced our weakness. The South was ripe for deconstruction and humiliation when White numbers declined below 50%‚Äîjust needed the spark to cow poor Normie into acceptance.Statutes and now military bases. Watch for the first base to be named in honor of their latest martyr, Floyd.(Navy ships have also been so named recently.)And perhaps they are right.  In a society where equality and diversity are sacred issues‚Äîrather than liberty and freedom‚Äîthen such folk are the appropriate icons.  To the victor goes the spoils.  Early Christians took over ancient pagan temples throughout the Middle East, scratching out the old gods and carving in crosses.  Mohammedans in turn took over the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople.My dog is the park immediately goes to the largest tree, sniffs, and then pisses all around it‚Äîannouncing to all that he is now the top dog.  And so it goes.

                    A great proportion of the soldiers ‚Äî enlisted and junior officers come from the old South. I wonder how they‚Äôll react?And these young men (and wiminz) have been bathed in the diversity Kool-Aid since conception, the same as any coastal kid from NY, MA, CA etc. The officers got mega-doses of it through their respective commissioning sources, especially the ROTC kids.  Once they arrive at their duty stations, they are subjected to constant diversity and inclusion conditioning and practically forced to swear a greater allegiance to those ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù than the ones of the very country they vowed to defend. The ones who object to it will remain silent for fear of facing figurative (for now) public execution. I spent too many years on active duty to be optimistic about the good ole boy soldier/sailor/airman/marine rising up against left-wing tyranny. They will likely keep their mouths shut, their heads down, and do their jobs until it‚Äôs time to ETS, leaving their chosen branch to rot from the inside without them. It is the same thing we see with law enforcement nationwide.  The situation for them passed untenable years ago and has now reached a point of lunacy. They‚Äôre used to working without support from the top, but we‚Äôve arrived at a place where the people who control their money are about to zip the purse shut for good while they say and do nothing as maniacs call for cops to be shot dead like wounded animals. How much worse can it get for them? If you know a cop then you know someone who is positively terrified to to do their job, yet day in and day out, they press on.

                                I think investing in supporting police a wise investment.I think the elites will regret betraying the police, the army, forcing degradation upon them.Jim Crow you know was far a worse mistake than slavery; it was degradation, no other impact.  A slave can understand being worked for money ‚Äì but to degrade ? Only yo raise the status of poor whites?As we can see before us, degradation is worse than chains, than death.Of course this isn‚Äôt even nogs idea.  Its the Karens and the usual suspects.

                        What was once the norm, and acceptable: first they criticized, then attacked, then made immoral, and finally unthinkable.  At the end, it all will be illegal, if that even matters anymore at that point.  But yes, once things like honor, truth and believing in the goodness and supremacy of our then-culture, the reality of two sexes, that marriage was between a biological male and female, these were things of which most were guilty.  And though all of this, they hated us and our beliefs, and they lied, and schemed, and burrowed beneath and within us.  Now we are without recourse.

                        the covid lockdown has done economic ddamage to the world economy and the complex supply chains. It‚Äôs not all visable yet, but lots of countries overseas are faceing dire times ahead . I have noticed locally that nce things dissapear form the wearhouses , stores cannot order more of them from overseas. I think this will be getting much worse soon.

        Normie and a lot of dissidents think the ship will right itself in the November election. Supposedly that is when the silents will have their voice heard. I mean, just look at Biden. Trump will destroy him in the debates.The coronvirus lockdowns were just a trial run to see what normie would put up with. For God‚Äôs sake they are still wearing masks! Now most really do think this present theater is about black lives and justice. Need I quote a title from Derbyshire‚Äôs book here?

                I was in the odd position of never really being challenged on the lockdown. All my business is ‚Äúessential‚Äù and none of the Rural Kings, feed stores and big hardware stores near me even required masks. Some of the ones in the city did, but I managed to avoid frequenting them when doing my business.The only time I had to wear a mask was when taking my daughter to the urgent care for a dislocated kneecap. They had me over a barrel then. The most offensive thing was that there was a metal detector at the entrance to this new urgent care in this nice 99.999% White small town. It was totally incongruous. They made me hand over my pocket knife. I didn‚Äôt have a gun because it‚Äôs state law in Ohio to not bring a gun into a hospital.

            My city is totally locked down. I see people alone in cars with masks. People on the streets with masks with holes cut for them to breath through. Walking down the sidewalk people get out of my way and walk on the street. It‚Äôs really weird.The thing is I still live in the heart of darkness and my eyes are filled with ugliness daily but the horror-show only gets worse .Egad !

                My shock is that such things as mask wearing and other ‚Äúpreventatives‚Äù are not even justified under scientific study.  I read whenever bored or motivated enough the direct, published studies that are supposed to drive such economy shattering recommendations by our ‚Äúexperts‚Äù.  And I find that in any number of cases, their recommendations are at odds with current data and analysis.For example:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372NEJM, May 21 study on mask use by public.  I‚Äôll save you the read.  Mask use in close, constant contact settings‚Äîlike hospitals, nursing homes‚Äîgood.  Mask use by folks in outside settings, brief encounters (stores), not shown to be effective‚Äîpossibly even counter productive.Thats the science.  What goes against the science must be done with ulterior motivation, and yet folks argue with me that some self-declared expert on TV knows what‚Äôs best.  Perhaps it‚Äôs as simple as‚Ä¶most folk are too stupid to be anything, but slaves!

                I find this so strange.Go to Toronto, the second worst hit city in Canada by COVID, and it seems like nobody gives a fuck. Few people wearing masks, people out in groups, etc. People from all swaths of life just don‚Äôt care, from rich to poor. Maybe some superficial ‚Äúefforts‚Äù (elbow bump instead of handshake).If we had to see one benefit of non-white immigration, I suppose this is it. Arabs, blacks, Indians, and the various 3rd worlders living in the GTA are not keen on ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù. Karen can‚Äôt really shame you because there are so many of THEM not doing it.

                    In my neck of the woods, its Whites that don‚Äôt wear masks. Latinos and Blacks seems to enjoy wearing them probably because it was anti social a few months ago.Its getting less common and around here honestly no one cares. Its nearly back to normal or whatever passes for it.There are a few areas with Goodwhites and Karens, they‚Äôve bothered friends of mine but I get left alone. I guess I look too feral.

            All this is temporary, David. Race reality IS going to reassert itself, good and hard. Many on both sides of the divide hate Trump‚Ä¶ But there he is. People laugh at derision at the mass media and our leftist rulers. A lot of leftists are horrified at the notion of disbanded police departments.When the police departments fall, and the chimp-outs come daily to respectable and affluent neighborhoods, when the beautiful people start getting their noses rubbed in leftist militancy‚Ä¶ Normie is gonna fuggin snap. He‚Äôs halfway there already. Historically‚Ä¶ This is what happens. Black supremacy is going to be a very, very short lived phenomenon.The 600 lb gorilla in the room is not Normie. It‚Äôs Lefty‚Ä¶ And once we deal with the blacks‚Ä¶ If we‚Äôre smart we‚Äôll deal with Lefty too.‚ÄúIF‚Äù we‚Äôre smart‚Ä¶ And that is a very big ‚Äòif‚Äô.

                I have found that people on the normie left are easier to convince than people on the normie right. Normie right are true believers in blank slate, stock markets, ‚Äúwe all came from somewhere‚Äù. Look at the cowboy hat black man from Wisconsin standing up for cops on TV!I sense that normie leftists recognize the truth but are ashamed and afraid to express it. Their rejection of the truth can come out as anger, denial, or fear.I predict that when the hammer drops the normie leftists will fight more viciously to defend their neighborhoods, schools, and lifestyles than the righties will. Go to any normie left establishment ‚Äì craft brewery, good school, Trader Joe‚Äôs ‚Äì they are in fact white ethnostates.

        People seeing themselves as the reasonable middle is pervasive, largely because being in the middle means they think they are safe from backlash from both the extreme left and extreme right.For example, the normie overwhelmingly supporting BLM, but also overwhelmingly supported using federal troops to quash the riots.One way to break the conditioning is to show that even the most milquetoast normie take will lead the mob to destroy you.  The Drew Brees incident jarred my old man.  I asked him, flat out, why he watches and cheers people who hate him every fall.  Planning to do the same for my brother in law.

                        Well, some Boomers mean it. I stopped watching niggerball about 20 years ago. No college or pro football or basketball.I watched a little soccer, but I see too many blacks there now. I was a football coach at one point decades ago.

                    One way we can identify ‚Äúprospects‚Äù for Our Thing is stuff like this. More and more people are disgusted and horrified at the directions being taken by many aspects of the pop culture. If your friend is willing to swear off football he may be ready for other ideas.Which issue to lead him too? Well, all our ideas are connected to some degree just like those of the enemy so it may not matter which specific thing you pick. Just base it on what you know about him. If he likes guns, as do many normie whites, invite him to a shooting event. If he‚Äôs the intellectual type and has expressed some interest in the JQ, maybe suggestThe Culture of Critiqueto him. The point is bring him into ‚Äúthe network‚Äù.Footnote: This is one reason I get pissed off when I hear people on this or other DR blogs speaking ill of the ‚Äú2A boomer types‚Äù. Think of those network diagrams you may have seen. These are often drawn to show the ‚Äúnodes‚Äù in different colors or sizes by how many connections they have with other nodes. Guns and 2A issues are a YUUGE node (in the US at least). Those things have millions of connections to other nodes and many to our ideas as well. Just the other day one of my favorite (but totally civ-natty) YouTube gun channels talked about the riots and flashed up a shot of Soros, clearly linking the two. Yesterday he was expressing some skepticism about the lockdowns. He‚Äôs clearly being influenced by some of our ideas. He‚Äôs been talking to some people ‚Äì our people. He may not openly embrace the DR yet but he‚Äôs preparing his viewers for openness to some of what we talk about. Also, when the time comes I think he will make the right choices about whom to cast his lot with.

        I had a bit of an epiphany about this last night because I of the existential dread I was feeling about where we are headed. Once I realized what the ‚Äòplay‚Äô is I felt much better. This was also partially fueled by being blackpilled and defeatist on yesterday‚Äôs replies.I ain‚Äôt that guy. I‚Äôve already faced consequences on this very topic most of you can‚Äôt (and shouldn‚Äôt) imagine. So how to prevent more of you from joining me? Then it hit me and it is something from the Game era and from Heartiste (PBUH). You are dealing with a mercurial emotional ego driven creature with the reasoning capacity of a 5 year old: modern western wahmen.How do you steer such a creature?Agree and Amplify!This is the weapon that you should deploy -immediately- to every Karen, soyboy, and normie that you know. Instead of pushing back that they are brainwashed cultists (they are), simply push them over the cliff and outwoke them.Karen: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you aren‚Äôt being more proactive in seeking outhereticsracists to destroy!‚ÄùYou: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you are just trying to cancel people. We need to literally start killing them. This is the only way to really be sure since they can never be trusted again. At the minimum, life in prison.‚ÄùYou see where I‚Äôm going with this, but be sure the target‚Äôs of your wrath are shitlibs, fellow whites, soyboys, numales, and lefty wahmen only. Get the ‚Äòrevolution it‚Äôs eats own children‚Äô kicked into overdrive so the purity spiral and circular firing squad gets turned up to 11. You cannot reason with these people but they DO respond to being not pious and holy enough. Use their religiosity as a weapon against them.p.s. The ability to link a disqus account appears to be broken today just fyi. ‚ÄúInvalid Request:Invalid parameter: redirect_uri (should match predefined callback URI)‚Äù

                It is as simple as taking whatever virtue signal they are spewing and dialing it up to Clown World Mega proportions. For normies, you want to follow up with questions like, I thought you supported this cause? Of course people need to be imprisoned or killed. This will cause enough cogdis in a normie that you gently ‚Äòsteer‚Äô them back off the cliff.For shitlibs, you want to do the opposite and go full throttle. You must -always- keep them off their feet. This is the ‚Äòneg‚Äô from Game Theory applied to woke bullshit. You mean you only PARTLY support BLM because you don‚Äôt think imprisonment and execution are ok. Reverse psychology. They are NOT holy and righteous enough, you are. Ultimately, in a perfect world you‚Äôd catch them on video saying that insufficiently pious whites should be imprisoned and killed.This is how the Heartistes, Rooshes, etc. of the world (and perhaps Apex Preds üôÇ ) managed to bed lots of stupid lefty women in the 00s. Once you understand the childlike mind you are dealing with manipulating it isn‚Äôt terribly difficult.

            JFC, sorry for the grammar / spelling mistakes in that. This is why I like having an edit button attached to an account. üôÇp.s. For the above strategy, the idea for normies is to ‚Äòshock the system‚Äô so they see in their confused minds the end game which likely will be tithes, danegeld, imprisonment, etc. for the insufficiently woke. There is a -lot- of historical precedent for this. For the wokesters the idea is to simply get them to destroy each other in case it wasn‚Äôt clear why you are using the same strategy on both groups. I often hear people saying ‚Äòwhat do we do‚Äô. I just told you‚Ä¶. go forth and prosper!

            Apex, I‚Äôve been using that technique for a few years now, and I can vouch for it being effective. I tend to do the ‚Äúslow push‚Äù leading to 11 rather going directly to 11, i.e. I make normie turn the dial with me.Normie: We need to bring communities together and fight against racism and social injustice.Me: Absolutely, but talking isn‚Äôt enough. People have been talking about these things for years. We need to actually do something. (Start slowly pushing Normie toward changes in his life.)Normie: Of course, of course. I just contributed to the NAACP and Unity for All.Me: That‚Äôs great. I contributed to not just those groups, but other worthy organizations. (Show Normie that you care more.) But we whites shouldn‚Äôt think that we can just buy our way out of our guilt. You, me, all of us here. We‚Äôre all guilty of white privilege and oppression. Giving away a few hundred dollars ‚Äì money that we don‚Äôt even notice it‚Äôs so small ‚Äì isn‚Äôt enough.Normie: (He‚Äôs getting slightly nervous now. This is going past where whites usually go.) Well, sure. That‚Äôs why I went to the march, to show my support.Me: Yes, and that was great. But, again, it‚Äôs just words. We need action. Action that matters.Normie: (He‚Äôs starting to look a bit confused.) Like what?Me: First off, what about our neighbors who didn‚Äôt go to the march or who haven‚Äôt posted on Facebook supporting BLM and condemning racial injustice. Their silence shows that they don‚Äôt support BLM and that they believe racial injustice is just fine.Normie: Well, I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs happening. They may just think that things are complicated.Me: Complicated? What‚Äôs complicated about police murdering an innocent man? What‚Äôs complicated about white racism and oppression of minorities? We need to start posting the names of those who didn‚Äôt go to the march and who haven‚Äôt put up on Facebook their support of BLM and their opposition to racial injustice.Normie: (Definitely getting nervous now.) I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. We start publicly naming people who we think don‚Äôt agree with us.Me: Absolutely. It‚Äôs not just that they don‚Äôt agree with us. It‚Äôs that they‚Äôre condoning racism, police brutality and white privilege. The world should know that they‚Äôre racists. If they‚Äôre not, then let them post on social media that they want to join the fight against racism.Normie: I don‚Äôt know. Isn‚Äôt that like blacklisting people for their political beliefs? I mean, I totally disagree with them, but we should have freedom of speech.Me: Freedom of speech?! These people are racists and support murdering blacks because of their color. We can‚Äôt let people like that get away with those beliefs. Besides, they can say what they want. We‚Äôre not the government. We‚Äôre not stopping them from saying that they‚Äôre racists. We‚Äôre just telling the world about them.Normie: It just seems like we‚Äôre attacking people. They haven‚Äôt even said anything.Me: Their silence says what they believe in. And what‚Äôs wrong with attacking racists? In fact, we should contact their employers and let them know that they have racists working for them.Normie: Wait. Now you want to get them fired?Me: Absolutely. They‚Äôre racists! Besides, I‚Äôm not firing them. I‚Äôm just letting their boss know that they‚Äôre racist. He can decide what to do. Of course, we should let the boss know that if he keeps a racist around, that makes him and the company racist. And we‚Äôll definitely let the world know that he and the company are racist.That‚Äôs how you let Normie see where this is going.

                I see what you are saying but the problem is you are dealing with Joe Six Pack here who is NOT the sharpest tool in the shed. That subtle build technique you are using is great for ‚Äòclosing‚Äô leftist retard women and bedding them. For what you are trying to accomplish, it may have the exact opposite effect.You are pitching softballs that they may absorb as truth in this hysterical time of clown world insanity. By slow boiling them, you may find them agreeing with you at the end because midwits gonna midwit. This is why I drop the hammer much earlier because that is how you get that cogdis circuit misfire when you go from shame them on Facebook directly to fire them, imprison them, or kill them depending on their history.But to each his own, at least we have an active psyop warfare strategy instead of sitting around kvetching w/ no game plan.

            Haha, I made a similar comment maybe a week ago. Too lazy to go find it. Wahmen and soys are a collective hysterical woman, and White Men are men.We‚Äôre being faced with a giant shit test and we‚Äôre badly failing. Feminism is a shit test too. White men failed that one.These are existential. I pass every time, mostly because I don‚Äôt give a fuck about feminism or white privilege, and wahmen / soys are just annoying flies buzzing around. 99% of white men fail though.

                                As a small child I attended the mortgage burning for my Episcopal church building. A year ago, five queers were running the place and there were approximately five attendees. The diocese carried the operating expenses including salaries.A few weeks ago the building was listed for sale. The other Episcopal church within 50 miles is bordering on collapse and it will go under according to childhood friends this next year.From ashes to ashes and from dust to dust. I converted to Orthodox Christian. Queers and SJW need not apply.

                                    My mom‚Äôs church is dying for the same reasons. A few years ago they went Hard Left and drove all the families away. So now the church membership are all aging liberals ‚Äì congregational hospice, it‚Äôs just a matter of time before the church literally dies off. I told my mom to stop arguing the finer points of Protestant theology and instead start commenting how their church building, the oldest in her state, constructed in 1805, will make really nice condo‚Äôs in a few years. Apparently that line has caught some people‚Äôs attention. But not enough to change anything.

                I wish someone would grab that anti-Pope by his scrawny neck and point that fact out. I lay this on whole thing on him and his washing Saracen feet stunt. I say this as a Roman Catholic. Of course, that would take Cardinals and influential Bishops to do so, and they obediently went along with the entire shutting the churches down for covid. You know, cause Jesus wasn‚Äôt a rock the boat type. Isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúGo along, get along‚Äù in the gospels somewhere?

                    @Penitent:I too am R.C.And as the lovely Ann Barnhardt likes to point out: if one, just one of these gutless, feckless, useless Cardinals stopped being ‚Äúafraid for their lives‚Äù and had 1 other person film them on an iPhone, followed by a quick upload, they would begin to put an end to this whole thing.Imagine: a five-minute video naming names and telling the truth, and the whole house of cards would begin to tumble.But that would, of course mean, that said Cardinal  (of the video) would likely lose his life. But I thought that‚Äôs what the R.C. church was based upon?I have lost no love for any of those useless men.

                    Actually He allowed a prostitute to wash his feet. And kept the company of the unclean and deviant but not in the way the demented Lefties like to portray, as if he was just cool with what they did and hip to different ‚Äúlifestyles‚Äù. Jesus always forgave but with the admonition and command to ‚ÄúGo, and sin no more‚Äù. Quite a different reality.If the anti-Pope washed the feet of M.E. and African migrants seeking admission to the faith, eschewing their former religions, and repenting their sins‚Ä¶ he would have at least been doctrinally and theologically correct.Instead he argued ‚Äúsuccor to the poor‚Äù which is patently misleading. Were their feet so dirty as to require medical attention? That would be an act of charity. None of these migrants were seeking the faith and repenting so it was just a gross stunt. Either way he upsets God‚Äôs order and instead of rendering aid to those people in their homelands serves up his own tribe as a sacrifice to feels.Bergoglio has betrayed his role as defender of Christendom and betrayed the people of Europe, may Satan take his duplicitous soul.I don‚Äôt want to hijack Zman‚Äôs comment section so I‚Äôll leave it there. Just thought it was a pertinent point.

                        Actually He allowed a prostitute to wash his feet.Right, my mistake.Still, Christians are a bunch of wet hens, morally, and get a virtue-buzz when they wash the feet of criminals. And the more reprehensible the criminal, the more virtue they experience, because the bigger the sinner, the more joy in heaven over you forgiving him his transgressions against you.Forgiving the virtuous is child‚Äôs play, only a good Christian can forgive their brother‚Äôs murderer.

                            They‚Äôve been tricked- into reciting the shahada.

This is where and how they‚Äôve been quietly hijacked. Redirected, all unknowing. The Zman gives us a perfect picture, today, of the means.

I hesitate to explain, but will.
It‚Äôs a short explanation, too.

The Christians are absolutely necessary for what they do, just as ‚Äúatheists‚Äù- not active anti-theists, but simply those with a different operating framework- are absolutely necessary for what they can do.  Complementary.

                                If they have been highjacked, it is as much their own fault as that of the kidnappers. The Scriptures are there for their learning, and there are sound churches, too, but you have to DO something to find them, so the people you are talking about can‚Äôt be bothered‚Äìfor exactly the reason Zman says in this article‚Äìthey like to feel good about themselves. They like feeling smug. And making an EFFORT to learn anything is beyond their capacity or their will. THEY DON‚ÄôT WANT IT. These people are highjacked because of their own ignorance‚Äìwillful ignornace‚Äìand their own egos.Nothing remotely Christian about that.

                            No. You are confused. Nobody‚Äìincluding God‚Äìforgives unilaterally. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. Forgiveness and pardon followONLY upon (1) confession of guilt; and (2) request for pardon and forgiveness.These people who go around indulging their egos by all this trendy ‚Äúforgiving‚Äù are not Christians at all, regardless of what they, or you, or the public at large may think.Forgiveness is not, and by definition cannot be, unilateral.

Your theology may differ (Christians all seem to have their own, personal Jesus who coincidentally always happen to share their idiosyncratic moral values) but the huge majority of Christians are all about bending the knee and washing the foot, and it‚Äôs not just the prelates either: next to cat ladies and e-thots, the bane of our generation is church ladies.But if you could post a link to some Christian organisation embracing ethno-nationalism or even Christian nationalism, I‚Äôm all ears. Half of all the organisations footnoted in Michelle Malkin‚Äôs book about the refugee-industrial complex, are Christian.

It shouldn‚Äôt be comfortable, or an easy fit, for a creature to emulate or kneel before divine perfection. I love a well shaped womans leg but I strive mightily to not look lasciviously at women who are not Mrs. P. I enjoyed the thrill of combat but should have eschewed that primal exhilaration. I enjoy victory too much, pride too often, and can relish petty revenge.No friend, an easily adaptable god for me would be Conan‚Äôs Krom or Thor. Easy: drink, rut, win, enjoy and vengeance.  But those aren‚Äôt God.You might be placing the cart before the horse. What you think of as personally adapting Jesus to them may be quite the contrary‚Ä¶ they are emulating the will of their master whether or not they‚Äôd rather do things as they saw fit.I ended up going on too long again and I spent the night working on a mountain in blustering winds so I‚Äôll sleep now.

                            Some are ‚Äúwet hens‚Äù.. I like that saying.Perhaps. Depends on what you view as a Christian.Was the act of these sorry whites a Christian act? It must be broken down.Were the black recipients penitents seeking forgiveness and entrance into the Body of Christ and thus the act was given as a humble welcome from one sinner to another? No.The blacks were not approaching with humility seeking closeness to God and were instead looking for homage from the whites. This is the act of a victor or conqueror for them and nothing to do with God.The whites for their part were not committing the act as a humble act of welcome to another Believer into the fold or as Christ did to teach the act of service. These whites virtue signalled to their peers some inane misconstrued guilt for ‚Äúwhite crimes‚Äù against the blacks.Nowhere in the gospels is that motivation portrayed. What these whites and blacks committed is a deformation of Christ‚Äôs intent and therefore heresy. Anathema.To approach Christianity as a simple set of good/bad checklists and masochistic tasks is churchianity. Obedience to God requires thought and nuance. If you stop at ‚ÄúAbove all love one another deeply‚Äù as the Left likes to quote‚Ä¶ you never beg the question of what is the rest of the ‚Äúall‚Äù. The verse doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúLove everything and dont worry about the rest‚Äù.Christians are supposed to be humble but brave. Forgiving but resolute. Healer, but crusader if necessary. It‚Äôs a tough row to hoe for flawed creatures. This hippy-dippy squishy pseudo-Christianity is apostasy.Sorry to drag on Felix. I respect your point of view and enjoy your writing so I took the time. I just wanted to make you aware there is a robust masculinity to Christ and oft what you see with the churchianity types is a feminine-exclusive mockery of gentle aspect of Christianity.

        The tact I try to use is that you need to love yourself before you can love anyone else, no one is going to respect a loser who hates himself and tries to gloat about being a loser.  Not sure if it works or not though.  I extend it with my analogy about how the airline safety video tells you to put your oxygen mask on first: you won‚Äôt be able to help anyone if you don‚Äôt bother to save yourself first.  I then take it to the next step and ask them if they‚Äôd then put the mask on their own kid first, or a total stranger; what if it wasn‚Äôt your kid but your nephew?  Second cousin? Etc.Seems like maybe it‚Äôs a method to get people to ‚Äúback in‚Äù to our way of thinking; it‚Äôs a bit of a leap to get people to believe that they‚Äôve been lied to their whole lives and that they were duped by it.

            First off: tack, not tact.  Sorry, pet peeve.You are right on about loving yourself; and it goes farther into the concept of respect.  In terms of the airline question, I would put on my mask and then the mask of anyone dear to me if they were incapable.  If a stranger were having trouble, I might help them only so much as it would not endanger me in any way.As to the article.  I don‚Äôt want to be a good person, except to my wife and kids.  Everyone else can FOAD; especially if they are involved in promulgating this unpleasantness in any way.  I walked away from my siblings because they all devolved into a pack of leaches wanting some level of ‚Äúgibs‚Äù justified by our blood relation.As to the site.

        All due respect, Z, I strongly disagree here. The whole concept of ‚Äúreaching out to normies‚Äù is a giant waste of time and is comparable to the alt-right‚Äôs obsession with the unicorn black MAGAtards.Andrew Anglin actually wrote a great article on this a few days ago. In a nutshell, we‚Äôre not gonna convince any more ‚Äúnormies‚Äù of our ideas and positions. Those who wanted to choose a side have already chosen it. Battle lines have been drawn. The information on immigration, Zionism, neocon ideology etc. is widely and freely available online. If ‚Äúnormies‚Äù actually gave a shit, they would have done the research and changed their positions. The miniscule number of ‚Äúnormies‚Äù is not worth paying attention to. They are irrelevant. For better or worse, revolutions are made by a small number of strong-willed men.

                Without sounding like a snob, we ended up here because we are predisposed to critical thinking and not afraid of PC bullshit. Yes, so far we are only discussing issues anonymously, but it‚Äôs a start. The ‚Äúnormies‚Äù are either too scared, too dumb, or too apathetic to be relevant.

Were people less intelligent back then?Read the comments on all major DisRight talkboards, and you‚Äôll find plenty who being with ‚ÄúI used to think‚Ä¶‚ÄùNo, proselytizing works. And I suspect it works better than we think. Several of my ostensibly Normie friends are total race realists and anti-globohomo ‚Äì they don‚Äôt dare come out of the closet publicly due to the social penalty, so they pretend to be Normies, and I know for a fact they were bona fide Polyanna CultMarx only a few years back, so yes, pushing the Overton Window works.

            I can‚Äôt disagree with bubba more. The number of normies isn‚Äôt miniscule. Trump won the election on the backs of normies. Those patriotic flag-waving MAGA folks at the Trump rallies are normies. The immigration issue wasn‚Äôt allowed into the mainstream until Trump shoved it there during the 2016 campaign. The info on Zionism, critical neocon idealogy and immigration (legal) isn‚Äôt in the mainstream. Rush and Hannity and even Tucker won‚Äôt (or can‚Äôt) talk about certain topics. Many of our guys have been and are still being banned from big online platforms, like FB, twitter, and youtube. Many books (like Greg Johnson‚Äôs) have been banned from Amazon. Reaching out selling to normies is critical and you won‚Äôt find more fertile ground to close the deal. Normies already love America. That‚Äôs a great starting point.

                Exactly my point. The normies don‚Äôt give a shit about facts. Everyone knows blacks are predisposed to violence and live in dysfunctional communities. Everyone knows Jews run the media. Everyone knows immigration is out of control.The normies simply A) don‚Äôt give a shit or B) are too scared to say anything that rocks the boat. Either way, pandering to them is pointless.

        FWIW I was normie until I went broke for a while after ‚Äò08.  Eating plain rice, taking a job as a janitor, and selling possessions to make rent put things in perspective.  I believe prosperity, or at least its appearance, is the biggest barrier to appealing to normie.

For instance, when someone says ‚Äòwhite‚Äô, normie hears ‚Äòinequality‚Äô. On some level he knows that white means white and that he‚Äôs disliked simply for being white, but he can afford to delude himself.  He has the luxury of being naive.

        Look, IMO to seek to come up with ideas to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù this ‚ÄúNormie‚Äù is to BE Normie. To buy into the idea that what ails the culture can be fixed at the ballot box. Again, one man‚Äôs opinion here, you might as well buy into the any other leftist premise along the way. There are plenty on the march now to choose from.Once their nation fell, partisans had to figure out ways to survive once they chose to take to the forests. They made the choice NOT to collaborate. Not to be hauled off to a labor camp. Now it was about survival in the forest.That is where dissidents are at now. Trying to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù Normie runs the risk of outing ones self TO Normie. Gives Normie the power to out YOU to your employer, government agencies, and so on. Do you really trust Normie enough to do that? In terms of your risk/reward analysis, again: do you really trust Normie enough to do that? To EMPOWER Normie to do that?Scroll back the record to November 2016. Has life gotten better since then? Did you ‚Äúvote‚Äù your life better? The life of the Nation? Without going into the alternatives, Hellery and what that could have entailed, stay on bird in the hand. What evididece, real PROOF do you have that the ballot box will heal what ails?None.The choice may be, re-elect POTUS Trump and see a continuation of chaos. Or elect the feeble front man, and see chaos magically ‚Äúend‚Äù, to replaced by repression.In either of the above cases, if you choose to take to the forests, wisdom dictates you plan on how to best survive, or even prosper, within. IMO it starts with NOT wasting time on Normie with the risks that entails, especially in blue states and locales where you are really against the mob. Stay gray, choose your forest and keep your discipline. People that recommend home schooling are on a better track, as they suggest a specific strategy for inoculating your children from Marxist programming.

            I‚Äôm with Owl on this. Z is begging the question that ‚ÄúWake Up Normie‚Äù (‚ÄúSell To‚Äù) should be a strategy at all. Given limited time and personal resources, I believe those of us behind enemy lines should be vacating, not worrying about those that are asleep or panicking. Sell the house before the bubble pops, liquidate your junk, get mobile and retreat to areas where the potential to find community and protection is greater. My company will eventually show up on the Silence Is Violence radar. When it happens, I‚Äôll maintain silence, not show fealty, and be gone. The work lies ahead. There is enough to occupy all of my time, energy and emotion.

                Moss, I agree with your points, and you put it better than I did in terms of specific, concrete suggestions. I live within commuting distance of a blue capitol that was sacked recently and is undergoing continued turmoil. Already, the housing prices here have INCREASED since the riots, when I was expecting them to go down.While my wife is not a Normie, as a decent woman she has normal concerns. Yet, she has agreed to the plan of sell and get out while the getting is good. That makes her the only ‚ÄúNormie‚Äù I need to convince. However, SHE has convinced another family member to do the same, sell and get out while the getting is good.We have been around the country and have a feel for the places still worth living in. We are in the process of picking one.

                    Fellow Educated Redneck,I contend that Z‚Äôs choice of topics suggests he thinks this is important enough to discuss. So, I stand by my position.Lao Tzu might agree that the hills are a good place to attack from, in numbers of course.And the Rich Young Ruler that Jesus turned away was confronted with his idol. It had nothing to do with wealth and everything to do with his heart. Jesus read saw into his heart and mind, that‚Äôs all. A strange reference to my position, IMO. I appreciate you weighing in.

        My own personal piece of advice: dont be afraid to plant the seed and wait and dont be frustrated. We are in this for the long haul. I consider myself fairly aware of what is going on, but it took me years and i had to hear things multiple times before i could accept them, and i went down several dead ends that wasted months of time and on and on. People will need time, in fact its probably a red flag if they instantly go from normie to believing it all imo.The number one personality trait youre looking for in my experience is lack of fear of ideas, or intellectual oppenness ‚Äì someone who can dive into ideas they disagree with because they are curious to understand them if nothing else. That person may only take one seed of one idea to change their mind.

            Still flipping over in my head of how to defeat the sportsball fanaticism.  If/when whites find a way to bring one of their enemies to their knees, the world will change, and all they need to do is &lt;i&gt;not show up&lt;/i&gt;; but Z is right, trying to sell them on the idea of giving something up is hard.

                Since I don‚Äôt follow the negro felon league anymore, I‚Äôm not sure, but would guess there‚Äôs a reasonable chance they may not even have a season.  Or if so, then a truncated, largely no fans in the stands season.  As well, it would seem the college season may also be kaput.  A lot of fans may walk away in that scenario once they realize they can actually live w/o it.

        ‚ÄúOne of the truths about politics that many would prefer to ignore is that politics is not about facts and reason. The game is about persuasion.‚ÄùToo many WN want to believe that facts and reason persuade, but they cannot persuade people of modest IQ who can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt make the effort to understand, and, as you note, whose psychological comfort zone is wildly threatened by (what they see as because Jewvision has told them so) deviating from the safety of the herd.Messaging has to be simple , which is why those who ‚Äòmeme‚Äô well are so effective in this day.And, that messaging has to be visual, with few words.The age of persuasion through the written word is long over, if it ever was ‚Äì someone like me who does not deal with the media of podcast (talk radio) and videos is soon out of the loop.The despised minority angle is probably a winner ‚Äì picture kneeling before the Negro through eternity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but we cannot forget that liberal culture has created generations of Whites who have no internalized notion of duty to their children/grandchildren.For that reason, the Boomers and most Gen-Xers are a write off.  They will just follow the pack and the young White man is the hope.

            Note the discrepancy in reciprocating of foot washing.  If one wants to signal fellowship and reconciliation, then such an act is done by both parties.  But when it symbolizes subservience, only one party washes.  That is how I explain it to others.

            You are 100% wrong about interracial porn. It has a secondary knock-on effect of letting black males live out fantasy yes. It‚Äôsprimaryfunction and this has been the case for decades since porn become legal is to normalize the white female / black male paradigm. Negro bucks are the ‚Äòright‚Äô choice for feminine white women. This is consumed by young white males who then internalize this pathology.Taking their already broken sense of identity even further down. Hence the multi-prong attack of faggotry/trans/etc plus the IR porn. You are seeing an explosion in the number of white boys who ID as gay/bi/etc as well as just a general pussification / emasculation of young men. Fellow whites have been very busy haven‚Äôt they? And they have been the porn kingpins since inception. Again, should all this turn a different way remember well who did this and why so we can also say ‚Äònever again‚Äô just like they do.

                I‚Äôve always though of interspecies romance as bestiality.

Now they have parades in the street with their farm animals and are sent into schools and libraries to recruit converts ‚Äì i.e the ‚Äòfallacy‚Äô of the slippery slope.I looked into it a bit ‚Äì Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft and who was behind the changes ‚Äònormalizing‚Äô homomania in the American Psychiatirc Association DSM.The statistics relating to both pathologies as well , but it‚Äôs very challenging not to be repulsed, and it‚Äôs not a topic that any normal person would want to discuss.When it has come up, just listing off all the statistics usually shuts up whomever you‚Äôre talking to tout-de-suite. Works esp. great if there is an audience.The people responsible need to be called to account .

        Some things sell themselves. The propaganda organs try to hide the violent attacks on whites. We need to circulate the available vids as widely as possible and ask ‚Äúimagine when your children are a minority.‚Äù I do think there will be a backlash, but the question is whether it will be overwhelmed by those who prefer to be subjugated.

        ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so much that he fears being at the mercy of non-whites.‚Äù ‚Äì Jackpot.  That‚Äôs the problem right there.  And this is why, I think exiled right wing Californians peppered throughout mostly the west are years ahead of the rest of the country.  Californians who know what to fear and why.  Whites are now a sub-minority in the state.  The malfunctioning school systems are La-Raza brainwashing operations and have been for years.  So when Tarantino does that hyper-sentimental, boring nostalgia trip about Hollywood and The Valley, in-between his blaxploitation movies, it was actually an obituary of a formerly white place.  You would think normie would look beyond his geography and get a clue. ‚ÄúOh, California is so crazy.‚Äù‚Ä¶Why is that normie?‚Ä¶..you idiot‚Ä¶..you fool.

            You are right.  An obituary.  That‚Äôs one way to look at that film.  I love that movie, though, and bought the DVD.  When it first came out, I went to see it in a theater.  I was lmao throughout.  It really took me back to 1969 when my husband was on deployment during the Vietnam War.  We were living near a base in So Cali in 1970, so I had time to get used to the ethos in that place.  I remember being disturbed then that Sharon Tate was married to Roman Polanski.  The thing I noticed about the film when I thought about it later was the lack of blacks in it ‚Äî so refreshing that they weren‚Äôt cluttering up the place, being irrelevant characters in most of the lives of people I know, or even in Hollywood back then.  Wish the movie‚Äôs ending was what actually transpired ‚Äúonce upon a time‚Ä¶‚Äù

            A lot of my current understanding of things derives from growing up in Baltimore during The Great Transition as it went from white to black.  A lot of the trouble I have understanding the pozzed whites here on the West Coast is that I tend to assume most of the goodwhites here are just hypocrites who deny what they know from experience.  Most don‚Äôt have the experience I did though.  I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone the experience of being white in Baltimore, Detroit, CA, South Africa, or any other place overrun by PoC but it does seem to prime a person to become aware of a lot of uncomfortable truths.  White people who‚Äôve come out of such places have a great role in awakening others to the reality of just what will happen to them if they allow the demographic tsunami to keep rolling in.  Schools, shopping, recreation, neighborhoods, walking in the park, driving, and of course work ‚Äì let the PoC take over and it all goes to shit, and shityouwill still have to pay for.

        My reading of the state of normie in Britain is rather different than those about US normies in the comments above.I have been quite active on social media during this spasm and I can report that more than few eyes have been opened. Several previously card-carrying civnats and normiecons of my acquaintance are starting to look pink around the gills. I am seeing a level of awareness on my timelines that I did not see even a month ago. Very encouraging and, yes, I am doing my bit to nudge them along. No pushback at all.

            Well, keep a light on for us over here (and maybe a visa handy). You guys still have a chance demographically. That‚Äôs done over here. We can‚Äôt save what was once our country. That horse is out of the barn even if that‚Äôs hard to see right now.Honestly though, any of the European countries could do what the Dems did here, except in reverse. They brought in non-whites to tip the scales. If whites woke up in England and took control of the government, they could import whites from S.A., USA, Canada, NZ and Australia, offering them a homeland for their people. They would come, and they would be severely pissed off.

                If the UK had a government committed to BRITISH people, I would immediately leave this shithole Ontario and go back to my ancestral homeland.As it stands now, though, the UK is on the same path as us but with further to fall. It is probably more depressing to live through a place going from 85% white to 50%, than from 50% to 30% (Toronto).It‚Äôs all by design. Everywhere has to be the same to keep us from leaving.

                    Yep, at the moment, Europe and the UK are better demographically than the US and, I guess, Canada, but they‚Äôre still on the same path, just a bit behind us. In ~20 years, they‚Äôll be right where we are now unless they change course. And I truly hope that they do. We may need a place to flee to.

                    They think just one more self-flagellation and they will reach heaven.  They complete the ritual and a black man tells him, no, you must do more, you must degrade yourself more.  Such is the pattern they will follow, their own personal hell, for eternity.Even Dante would find that a little extreme.

        Zman‚Äôs suggestions are good strategy but also, in my view, a litmus test.If any normie is still unmoved at the prospect of their children being loathed and detested minorities, then you know immediately that he or she is unsalvageable.

        Most normies are not much interested in details. They live in the moment. Any interest in the past is almost always for entertainment purposes or a justification for the present.¬†Z is absolutely correct: any appeal that isn‚Äôt immediate and at the gut level is wasted breath.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to become a minority, a hated minority even if we stop all immigration. What‚Äôs your plan? Let the market decide? Allow the Constitution to magically undo what has been done to us during the past 70 years? Our forefathers resorted to much stronger actions with a lot less at stake‚Ä¶but we‚Äôre going to continue being reasonable? That‚Äôs your plan? Let the system function as it was designed to do and all will right itself? You‚Äôre living in nostalgia America. It no longer exists. It‚Äôs been dead for awhile.¬†Like every other damned group in this country we need to learn to take our own side. We are stewards of our inheritance not its wholesalers. The opportunities your fathers had are no longer available to your descendants. What will you tell your children and grandchildren who have greater social demands placed upon them with fewer and fewer means of meeting for pushing back on those demands? It‚Äôs progress. It‚Äôs just how things worked out? You need to be creative and find a way to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, Little Horatio Alger! ‚Äù (Make your own canned pitch. One that you can extrapolate upon when the opportunity arises.)Aim at the gut. Keep a bit of iron in your voice with a bit of humorous needling.¬†Part with them suggesting that we all need to widen this discussion. Most normies in one form or another see a lot of what we see, they just lack a framework in which to understand it. Getting someone to see the problem as an intentional and manipulated problem is always the first step. How to deal with it and why action is called for can come later.¬†Zman‚Äôs post today is a necessity. This blog attracts a certain type of individual, both commenters and readers. We all tend to overthink things far beyond what most normies are capable of responding to, at least initially. A normie friendly pitch, a brief one, will grab their attention¬†where a more weighty and/or lengthy one will not.

            Every conversation should include whitey becoming a minority.  A despised minority.  If I have time I like to briefly describe the ‚Äô65 Immigration Act, saying that‚Äôs where it all started. I‚Äôve yet to find a Normie who‚Äôs aware of that.  They tend to think becoming more multiracial is natural and they way America is supposed to be.

                ‚Äô65 is a good place to begin once you‚Äôve caught their interest.The immigration act.The attack on family stability with the Griswold Act making contraception easily and the freely available.The attack on public decency with the overturning of the moral code Challahwood once had to abide by.  The Pawnbroker gave a green light to nudity in film. It was only a foot in the door if even that but in hindsight it gave the redlight district access to mainstreet and everyone‚Äôs home.An attack on cultural unity, an attack on family stability &amp; formation and attack on public decency.  All of it planned with an intent to do harm to our social fabric.  About as natural as putting strychnine into a salt shaker.

        Look how popular sites such as Unz and Dlive are, as well as various right-wing radio shows, videos, blogs and websites. The situation   is not as hopeless as it may seem. There are a lot of people who agree in regard to race and  immigration. The far-left  makes the most noise, but to invoke Nixon and Trump, there is a  silent majority.

            I hope you are correct about ‚Äúright-wing radio shows,‚Äù which seem counterproductive because of how strongly they affirm the ‚Äúracism is bad‚Äù and ‚Äúyour belief is only valid if it helps blacks or you can find a black person who supports it‚Äù narratives.‚ÄúLowest black unemployment ever!‚Äù or ‚ÄúCandice Owens supports my beliefs!‚Äù are sad examples.

        These riots and the sucking up to the rioters has been demoralizing as hell. Watching all of this just makes me think ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doomed‚ÄùThe videos of cops kneeling and taking the knee and joining the protests is the strangest thing I‚Äôve ever seen.  While one group of cops was cucking in the worst possible way, another groups of cops was literally slashing tires in the Kmart parking lot.

There I was, reading ‚ÄúThe Shining‚Äù on the porch. I was so engrossed, night had fallen.

All the house lights were off, only the porch light was on. The crickets and frogs were singing like mad. I got to the bathtub scene, her dead, wet hands reaching for his neck, and the crickets and frogs‚Ä¶ stopped.

Pitch black. Total silence.
No light switch inside by the door.
I would have cross that room-
in the dark.

Too scared to move. To move outside that fragile cone of light, on the porch.

                FWIW, most states have breakdowns of demographics for their public school systems.  It‚Äôs a round about way to find out things your realtor can‚Äôt tell you.

        I like this. The single most important argument, and fact (sometimes they do collide but not often) is that whites will become minority. Normie thinks he can afford to be ‚Äònice guy‚Äô (as leftie defines it) b/c he still subconsciously ignores that his kind will be minority in his granddaughter‚Äôs generation. But removing that psychological shield of (false) safety, ie denial, can trigger a strong reaction. Some can‚Äôt handle it. Like Z said, you can‚Äôt save ‚Äôem all.

        For a great example of normie thinking, read the comments at this Powerline post about a black woman in Washington D.C. calling out Black Lives Matter supporters.  They are enraptured by her.  One even says, ‚Äúif we could get 15-20% of blacks thinking like this, the left would never win another election.‚Äùhttps://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2020/06/blm-is-a-joke.php

        Good essay. You cannot sell something a person doesn‚Äôt want. But you can make them believe you have their best interests at heart when they are ready to buy. Then you‚Äôll be their first choice. This is why it‚Äôs important to emphasize that racial separation is about love, not hate. Normies don‚Äôt like hate, but they‚Äôve been taught that ‚Äòlove‚Äô is the answer to everything. Also, the idea that we‚Äôre not talking about war, but a ‚Äòracial divorce‚Äô (as Greg Johnson puts it). This way of describing what WN stands for is more relatable.

            Yes, they have been taught that ‚ÄúLOVE‚Äù is the answer. All you need is love and all that crap.I have asked Joe Normie if he believes that God is Love.

        Z-Man‚Äôs comment about ‚Äúnever been a better time to sell dissident ideas to the normie‚Äù would be so true if facts governed thinking.¬†I certainly hope he is right.¬†But living in a deep blue area of the country has made me acutely aware of the social pressures to follow the new state religion.¬†Right now the dissident right lacks a megaphone and institutional presence (at least around here).¬†It seems that the current main priority would be to simply keep the flame alive and wait for the left to further overreach.¬†As for persuading ‚Äúnormie‚Äù, perhaps citing polls such as that showing that 72% (Monmouth University) of blacks are basically satisfied with their local police might help.¬†In other words, corporate (‚Äúnormie‚Äù) America is more ‚Äúwoke‚Äù than blacks!

        Racism is the pivotal issue here, the preference of your own kin to others.As long as Normie feels that is wrong, he will remain lost. Rather than snarky comments and coded messages, Normie must be told in clear language and in dead earnesty: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with being a racist, it‚Äôs how we were all created.‚Äù Forget explaining about HBD or crime rates, tackle the core, moral condemnation head on.The apposite analogy is family: ask Normie if preferring your own family to the neighbor‚Äôs is morally reprehensible and if it entails hating the neighbor or wishing to kill him.

            Yes. I have told people before that EVERYONE is racist because we all recognize those who are different. Why? Evolution. We evolved because nature or God or both wanted us to be able to recognize our own kind and those that were NOT our own kind.If you don‚Äôt like that fact, take it up with God.For generations on end we knew what a nation was. A nation is a community of people who share a common language, culture, values, traditions, ethnicity, descent, and history. That is what God was talking about when He told us he would judge the nations.

            Felix,Yeah, in my head, there is a constant battle between your reasoning and Z‚Äôs. I see both sides. As you say, this is a morality play. However, I just don‚Äôt know if Joe Normie is mentally ready for such a leap. Too much, too fast, and he won‚Äôt listen.Whites in the states, at least, have literally been brought up on the evils of racism, well, white racism. We‚Äôve been conditioned to view expression of white pride to be demonic.You‚Äôre asking Joe Normie to make a mental leap the size of the Grand Canyon. He‚Äôs not going to do it. He has to make this journey on his own ‚Äì with us leading him. He won‚Äôt make that journey with a guy he thinks is Hitler. (And, yeah, I know that a lot of Hitler‚Äôs ideas ‚Äì ethnic nationalism, not being ruled by a small minority, pride of people, etc. ‚Äì were good things.)The compromise ‚Äì for me, at least ‚Äì is getting Normie to admit that it‚Äôs OK for whites to be proud of their heritage, just like any other group. Normies are all about fairness. If you ask them if it‚Äôs OK for blacks or Asians to be proud of their history and people, Normie will answer, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù OK, Normie, then shouldn‚Äôt whites be able to be proud of their history and people? Here‚Äôs how they always answer, ‚ÄúWell, yes, but we should also acknowledge the terrible things that whites have done, like slavery.‚ÄùThe reply: Well, every group has things in their past that were pretty terrible. Look what the Japanese did to the Chinese. But that doesn‚Äôt stop the Japanese from being proud of who they are. Shouldn‚Äôt the same be true for whites?Normie: Well, yeah, I guess, but like I said, we shouldn‚Äôt forgot the bad things that we‚Äôve done.Me: Well, sure, but you‚Äôre not demanding that other groups list their bad deeds every time they say that their proud of who they are. A black guy can simply say that he‚Äôs proud to be black. Do you have different rules for whites?Normie: Well, no. It‚Äôs just that we should be aware of how a white saying that he‚Äôs proud of his heritage looks to other groups.Me: So you are saying that there are different rules. I can‚Äôt just say that I‚Äôm proud of my European heritage and the many great things that European Americans accomplished. That‚Äôs not fair. You‚Äôre being racist against whites. How is that better than those who are racist against blacks?Just keep hammering the guy with fairness. It will wear him down. Btw, this fairness technique doesn‚Äôt do a thing with white women. They don‚Äôt care about fairness one bit, nor have they in the past. For them, it‚Äôs purely about staying good with the dominant tribe/religion.With white women, I kind of agree with you. State calmly and strongly that you are proud of who you are. Women respect strength. Maybe bring up that their children will be discriminated against. Fear is another motivator for women, though most upper-middle class white women believe that they and their kids won‚Äôt have to deal with the brown horde, so that doesn‚Äôt always work.

            Well, yes I‚Äôd be very wary of giving ‚Äúfull membership‚Äù to just any rando who thinks, say, that dissolving the police is a stupid idea.  Lineman below mentions keeping him from joining the enemy.  In a post above Mitch describes seeing some of his friends posting pictures on Instagram of their kids protesting with BLM signs.  Raising doubts among normies about the pozzed narrative won‚Äôt necessarily bring them here but it‚Äôs worth it if it gets them to at least remain silent when this stuff happens.Social media allows virtue signalling campaigns like posting BLM signs and Floyd protests to spread.  Interestingly, this can be modeled somewhat like the spread of a virus.  Getting people to at least NOT participate in the latest pozzed madness is a way to, dare I say, ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù of these things.  A person who is exposed to a virtue signalling pandemic but doesn‚Äôt pass it on is like those people who get exposed to Covid-19 without getting sick.

        He rejects the chaos of open borders, because he is an orderly sort of guy. He wants a tough border, but as long as there is a legal process, he is fine with immigration.We were bombarded with stuff like this watching the cartoons as kids!  Can you blame normie for this?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZQl6XBo64MThis is pretty weak sauce compared to what the kids are getting today.If you want to see a glimpse of tommorow‚Äôs society, watch some sesame street and cartoons.

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶reaching the magic state of being not racist. Since no such place exists..‚Äù

That‚Äôs just it. All of their manufactured crises are unreal, unattainable, and unresolvable.

A false form of grace, since billions have found better lives through the gift of grace. The observable evidence is that grace works.

Is this falsity an exploitable weakness, then?

Our job is to defeat evil, after all.
Not run away, not wait for rescue, but to confront and defeat it.

Evil works by twisting our instinct towards its own end- thus, the Good is the stronger power, the deeper design.

            That‚Äôs just it. All of their manufactured crises are unreal, unattainable, and unresolvable.Just so. The reason ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a racist‚Äù works so well, is because everybody is a racist so the accusation always hits a spot.We‚Äôre not progressing as long as ‚Äúracist‚Äù is a slur, rather than a simple statement about unalterable human nature. Every time you insist that you are not a racist, you are affirming that being racist is a bad thing, helping to forge the weapon Globohomo wields so ruthlessly at our people.Always counter an accusation of racism with a polite, mildly curious ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with being a racist?‚Äù You love your family more than you love your neighbor‚Äôs family; does that make you an evil person?

        When do we start being honest about what we stand for?We‚Äôre supposed to tell people what ‚Äúthey need to believe‚Äù rather than what really happens when you believe the market is magical?Being honest is the equivalent of walking into church drunk?We‚Äôre all Straussians now?  Preach exoteric falsehoods about markets &amp; race &amp; save the esoteric truth for the inner party?Trying to out-Jew the Jews is a helluva way to appeal to quality Whites.I‚Äôd rather red-pill 3 guys who can handle honesty than 6 who have to be blindfolded just to meet us halfway.There‚Äôs sometimes a fine line between good salesmanship and fraud but this advice seems firmly planted in the ‚Äúfraud‚Äù camp.

        Slightly Off-Topic, but not really.If anyone is intellectually curious about societal &amp; cultural shifts, revulooshun, and especially how this is all being re-played today, just as it was back in France in the mid-to-late 1700‚Äôs here‚Äôs an interesting talk that Ann Barnhardt (blogger, these days) gave about the French Rev., and importantly, the things leading up to it.This video was made in 2012, but is very,veryrelevanttoday.It‚Äôs about proto-Marxist progression and subsequent genocide is playing out today.(‚ÄúProto‚Äù Marxist b/c Marx the man wasn‚Äôt yet born when the French Rev. took place.)https://www.barnhardt.biz/2020/06/08/its-a-religion-its-the-antichurch-right-here-right-now/

            Thanks, Carrie, I think it was Rwc who first reminded me of Barnhardt, and she has been on fire.

Hat tip to Rwc, thank you.
The AntiChurch, I totally agree.

        The reason I‚Äôve been lurking here for the last couple of years was to read the ‚Äònormie‚Äô comments.The one¬†‚ÄòTruth‚Äô I could count on was that the official story was not true .I had inform myself the hard way, by going to libraries and the libraries didn‚Äôt have the books I wanted to read, even when I put in requests for inter-library loans .Even after I got online in the mid 2000‚Äôs I didn‚Äôt find Kevin MacDonald until 2011 ‚Äì that put me back on track .That‚Äôs why I admire men like Adrian Arcand,¬†Revillo Oliver , George Lincoln Rockwell and Dr. Wm. Luther Pierce. They had to do it the hard way by going to Libraries and digging through microfiches of vintage newspapers. Then they stood up and told the world what they had found.That‚Äôs not to mention inventors like Thomas Edison , industrialists Henry Ford and genuine heroes like Charles Lindberg.Now it‚Äôs all there for anyone who want‚Äôs to know.The last time something this big happened was When Guttenberg published his bible.About 15 million Europeans out of a population of about 90 million were slaughtered ‚Äì that‚Äôs about 1/6th of the population .Everyone knows this !All of you are inspirational. Especially the ladies.

        I don‚Äôt understand why someone who rejects democracy is interested in selling normie, a decent but useless fellow.

Even if he votes, its useless.
The idea we‚Äôd get a war captain with democracy is idiotic, I cop to being an idiot myself with Trump.  He‚Äôs better than the alternative.

Normie will get it after his children are raped in front of him and he somehow survives, even then most of them willrun like the curs they are.

                    That‚Äôs why building a community (as much as that might seem a pipe dream at the moment) is so huge. Witnessing with their own eyes a group of normal whites enjoying themselves and feeling good about their people without looking like a bunch of Nazis would change a lot of minds very quickly.Imagine Joe (or even Jane) Normie looking at one gathering where they must be around people that they don‚Äôt really feel comfortable with and where they have to acknowledge their sins. Then, they see another group where they can let their guard down, feel comfortable and no one asks them to grovel. Sure, some self-hating whites or the truly indoctrinated will choose the former, but most will choose the latter.

                            Moss, this is an important point. Normie is lost and in turmoil.  Offer him a place to rest his emotional head, and he is ours.  We don‚Äôt win this through politics, and voting is pointless now.  We win it through community and shared faith.  They offer Normie a physical and emotional refuge, and that‚Äôs what he wants and needs right now.  Some will flatly refuse the offer, and others will be receptive but unable to divorce themselves from the politics of the situation, the politics that is placed front and center by the usual suspects, and which we must walk away from.  Blind side everyone, converts and enemies alike, with appeals to community and faith.  To the matter of whether there is a ticket out and away from the hell we are descending into, my take is that faith and community are the paths of redemption and renewal.

                History teaches that when you go to war, your chances of success go way up when you first train your troops to be better combatants. if you believe the war will be won with words, then by all means, train a cadre of salesmen. If you believe the war will more visceral and existential, then train accordingly. Look to the internet for videos of people trying to persuade rioters &amp; looters to back down. See how well that worked.

            So what‚Äôs your Plan B? Rollover and die.We‚Äôre just trying to move forward. Recruit where you can. Build relationships IRL. Will that lead to anything? I don‚Äôt know, but ‚Äúenjoying the decline‚Äù seems a cowardly way to go. Also, we have the blueprint for success. Small but dedicated and organized groups can accomplish a great deal. Granted, the other side knows this as well and will do whatever it can to stop us, but I suspect that over time, they‚Äôll have other problems to deal with as POC take the reigns of power.

                    On the contrary. Leftie race pandering is basically noblesse oblige, with Leftie as the noble. The more oblige he displays, the more noble he feels.The key is to deflate the notion that being a racist is morally suspect.

                I have no quarrel with proselytizing and recruiting. Go for it. I hope you succeed. And I‚Äôm not enjoying the decline. Rather, I‚Äôm suggesting that burying your head in the sand is not a sound survival strategy either.

                    TomA. To your point, when your back is against the wall you find where the real test lies. I‚Äôm not putting stock in it, but perhaps our people will find some deep, genetic-ingrained power to fight their way out.On the topic of waking Normie up, the goal would be to help them act out of strength vs desperation.

                I can‚Äôt stand the ‚Äúenjoy the decline‚Äù people.There are so many single white women in their 30s, looking for a decent husband. Many white men are giant man children who either never put down the work to have a career, or want to pump and dump. Most are ‚Äúenjoying the decline‚Äù on a subconscious level. They are afraid of putting in the hard work to improve their and their childrens‚Äô future. Game is good and stuff but it should be used as a tool to find and hold a good relationship or marriage.You had this point earlier, but the issue really is with white men.

                        I guess its a matter of perspective. You believe a well-organized militia is going to beat the Jackboot army of a future tyrant and I will put my money on a few dozen unknowns aiming their efforts at a few dozen tyrannical power-players calling the shots. Ancient wisdom . . . a man operating solely out of his own skull cannot be betrayed.

        Normie conservatives have very little ability to envision their world becoming much worse than what it is now. Bad whites who are in the middle of vibrancy are far less deluded than bad whites that live in largely white areas such as Wisconsin. That is why they could support Paul Ryan.

I don‚Äôt know any Texas normies who think that Texas will go blue like California, a formerly solid red state, did. They firmly believe that their Mexicans are different. They won‚Äôt believe it till it happens repeatedly.

        It is hard to reach normie until they become desperate because the left controls the culture and conservatives have already acquiesced to letting them control it.


I don‚Äôt know of a single conservative normie male who is desperate. They feel guns will save them and are anxious for BLM and antifa to come to their areas. They also believe that there are militias ready to kick ass.

            One story of tye transition. I was a lefty , was and still am a college prof at an ivy type school.  I was on a site where sailer comments and thought he was an awful racist but i kept reading because he was so logical.  Once i started reading and couldnt refute his arguments i switched my politics.  But its kind of miserable. I have to guard my tongue 24 7 and its distanced me from my friends who are almost all left.  Plus eventually the cultural revolution is going to get me.  Sure would be nice if there was somewhere to go for people in our thing.

                Anon, you have to find a community of like minded. You have to seek them out, they won‚Äôt come to you. Church, grass root political groups. There are many of us out there who are looking for ppl like you. It‚Äôs too hard to go it alone. Find a support group.

        I agree with the post.  Lots of new customers.  I found that many are receptive to the facts if presented in a matter-of-fact diffident way.  I always act unhappy about the cruel facts of IQ and genetics.  I also have professional credentials so that might make it easier for me.   When i first started talking IQ race realism in the comments of normie blogs it was as if i dropped a turd in the punch bowl.  It is satisfing to see others pick up where i left off and repost stuff they got from me.  I don‚Äôt do the twitters. Anyone seen race realism there?  The counter auguments are easy to bat down.  For instanse, Gould‚Äôs the mismeasurement of man was humourously written prior to the bell curve.  No serious refutation of the bell curve has emerged.  When we win, we should commision  a statue of C Murray.

        We need our own theater. Besides released doxxed a customer email complaint about Amazon BLM support.We need lawsuits against Bezos personally seeking damages for this man and class action alleging Bezos has sent conservative customers info to anti factor harassment.And also class action on behalf of White victims of Black hate crimes that Bezos helped by donating and supporting a criminal Rico enterprise BLM. And showed depraved indifference to Black on White hate crimes.Indeed he should be sued globally there are many unemployed lawyers. Tobacco companies were immune until they were not.Even if losing Bezos should be forced into court to testify.

        i wonder if all those joggers at the funeral realize they are asking for mercy and guidance from a white god named Jesus. Probably not. Well, maybe they do .and this fact proves what Zman says all the time. If the whites go away the joggers are out of Business.
