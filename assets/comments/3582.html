        It all depends on what kind of unity you are seeking. The Paris Parade claims to be about unity, but is really just whistling past the graveyard of the consequences of multiculturalism. When push comes to shove I’m not sure Europe has what it takes to resist the “unity” efforts of Islam.And I think people feel there are more Moslems in their countries than the hard numbers indicate because of the outsized negative influence Moslem “culture” has on Western civilization, with all it’s attendant problems.Gosh, I really miss Breitbart! He could really take the Left to the woodshed. We sure could use him now.

        “There were still more arrests for other types of terrorism (motivated by separatism, for example) in Europe in 2013”So, the separatists want to separate. That’s all. Can be a problem for the larger country but not the end of the world. In the 60s and 70s in the UK, for example, the Welsh separatists started burning down holiday and weekend cottages owned by the English ‘overlords’ while they were away at work in the week but the cottages were empty at the time. The IRA did it differently, admittedly, but the Irish have long had an obsession with being hurt by events hundreds of years before. It is called holding grudge, which the Welsh got over easily enough. All very irritating but no one was being threatened with having to wear veil or publicly believe in something unbelievable.Different with Islam: the goal isn’t to be a separate entity but to make everyone have one way of thinking, under their inflexible rules. Worse as far as these dastardly Europeans are concerned, the separatists might fly a flag at times and insist on the local adoption of their own language (I have a Welsh friend who calls her own native language ‘Grok’ and much prefers to speak English) but the separatists don’t blatantly parade their determination not to integrate.

            Unity has become an weird Orwellian term brandished by the lunatics to intimidate the rabble. “Why are you trying to be different?? “Why can’t you get with the program?” “You’re not against unity are you?”
The irony of the “Unity Parade” in Paris is that demands for unity are the cause of their troubles.
