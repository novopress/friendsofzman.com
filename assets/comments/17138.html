        I grew up in a secular world, my parents were liberal atheist and we never had any problem with Jewish people. Generally thought they were good because high IQ, got a lot done. But now it really looks to me like the Jewish people  just hate the descendants of Christendom so much that they will do anything to destroy us, including destroying themselves. We’ve all heard about the Golden Age of Islam and it’s tolerant Society but that myth is spread by Jewish people because they like Islam because it refutes Christianity. Islam will say that Jesus is a prophet but they deny the resurrection and without the resurrection there is no Christianity. The Jewish people hate Jesus. First century Rome didn’t care about Christianity they just considered it a Jewish sect most of the persecution came from other Jewish people. With the destruction of the temple and the scattering of the people Christianity was allowed to grow but to this day the Jewish people hate the descendants of Christendom. It’s really ancient and tribal. And in a global representation of the adage “cutting off your nose to spite your face”  I think that’s why they want to let all these Muslims in. It’s absolutely insane.

            This is where their Samson myth comes into play. “If we pull the cathedral down on our enemies, we may also be destroyed. But it will be worth it.”

            My company acquired an Israeli company several years ago, and I ended up spending quite a bit of time in Jerusalem working with Ashkenazi Jews.  They were very smart, having built the company around their many holidays and daily prayer breaks.  I estimate they worked about 6 hours per day, and maybe 200 days per year.  They were extremely friendly and welcoming, and loved to talk about their faith.  But wow did it shut down if I tried to talk about my Christianity.  The general consensus was summed up by one employee, who said that Jesus was a hippie troublemaker who betrayed his faith.

                That was actually one of the things that made me move away from Atheism in the first place. I looked around and saw that there were all these different arrows pointing directly at Christianity from different places in the globe and they were all held by terrible people. And I thought if this many terrible people hate the same thing there’s probably something really important there

                            Appreciate your caution and concern but the quote was not what I live by.  Look around at the secular globalist world and the strange bedfellows with whom they cohabit. See who was dancing when Notre Dame was burned. In one city the Left danced, in another city Islam danced. They use whoever brings them power.

                            Although that’s the main reason Christ taught us to love our enemies: Because they are the instruments of our destiny. OF course they define us, if only partially, but that part is hugely important.

                        How does that work? If, say, Warren Buffet, promised to give you anything you wanted for Christmas, provided you started to believe in Santa, would you be able to induce that belief in yourself?

                    I feel your post requires an interpreter. I’ll try to interpret this garble, feel free to correct – or maybe the 43 people that liked and therefore understood it could correct me then some questions if i may:– You suddenly thought about attacks on christianity?– The arrows u mention are symbolic attacks on Christianity by various people?– These people were all atheists from around the world who were all terrible people?– This made you disagree with a non-belief in religion? Ie. Became a believer?– Because it was being criticised a lot, you thought it must be good?Is that what you’re trying to say?

                        Good Lord. It’s a principle of reading that the reader take the writer’s words and use them to get into his thoughts–without, be it noted, putting words into the writer’s mouth, which you have done throughout your list. Read what is written and don’t add stuff. The writer’s meaning was quite clear.

                    I have critiqued that POS Soros… and gotten called an anti-Semite.  (ROFL – I wear a kippa outside, and this by a fellow Jew who doesn’t).  I’ve called out – to no effect, of course, but cathartic nonetheless – that civilizational traitor Barbara Spectre:https://redpilljew.blogspot.com/2018/05/g-d-damn-you-barbara-spectre.htmlAnd have openly stated that if she’s ever put up on the gallows I want to be the one who pulls the lever for what she’s helped do to 1) Europe, 2) white people, and 3) destroying the perception of Jews.I’ve been blocked by who-knows-how-many Jews who, when I call them out on their Islamo-philia… just call me a Nazi.  OK.  Fine.Western Civilization is the greatest civilization that the world has ever seen.  It is worth defending.  And I will do my best to do so.

Going to be entertaining next year at our shul’s political breakfast where we bring in candidates to talk.  Either I wear my Gadsden flag kippa, or one of these.

                Good to see.  I’m another believer in “based Jews” being good for Our Thing.  Please red-pill your friends and have a shitload of kids.  Openly ethnocentric Jews who don’t try to sell me shit like “Judeo-Christianity” are not by definition my enemy.  This has been my experience with most Right-wing Jews from Israel (of which LA has quite a few I’ve worked with). Ashkenazim seem give be the main troublemakers for both of our tribes.  We can work together on that.

                    I’m a former ultra-liberal who switched to being hard-core Right – almost entirely by my own bootstraps.  If I can do it alone, with people like you, and others I know, we surely can help free others from the Democrat’s Egypt.

                            First, read the series in my Red Pill Journey (link just above).  I know it’s a cop-out, but I put a lot of effort into trying to document the whats and whys of my shifts.I would say the biggest things that hindered me were:1. Vestiges of my love for my parents.  They saw me moving away from their cherished liberalism and – not quite weeping – but were very upset.  They were my mom and dad… and it was hard to change while still HONORING MY MOTHER AND FATHER.2. My atheism.  For a long, long time I was an atheist, and moved in those circles.  People who are atheists are, overwhelmingly, left (not all, but most).  It’s hard to tear yourself away from your support structure.  Eventually I did, because I’d rather be alone but honest with myself, than lying just to have friends.

                I am a big proponent of the ethnostate or an ethnostate for most all ethnic groups (or races, if you will).I am also despise NAXALT.   Regression toward the mean is a stone cold female dog.  Seen it too many times to discount it.That said, even the Austrian Corporal was prevailed upon by army officers married to women of the Tribe to leave them alone.  And the Wehrmacht did the same for many tribe members who served.  And I see diminishing returns and increased costs going from 90% to 99 44/100%.That said, I am not fully on board with Z-man’s previous podcast where it was all up to the edge cases to figure out where they fit in.  I just read a paper that demonstrated that mixed-ethnicity children and spouses really take it in the face when inter-ethnic competition goes kinetic.  By both sides.

                    Check out the Lowry War of 1864. Mixed-race free people were forced into dangerous labor to protect black slaves, resulting in a rebellion.
One of those tidbits of history the left will never bring up because it upsets their narrative.

                Remember the Ten Tribes.Judah seeks to rule the rest, then by extension, the rest of us.1942-45 was a repeat of the Ten Lost Tribes, it’s in the manual.Judah’s god is not yours, nor is he ours.  Each peoples have different collective oversouls- gods- that move them.  Genetics is a spectrum of “frequency” sensitivity, we march to the sounds of different drummers.The false axiom, one line of root code that warps all above it, “there is but One god, the supreme, the creator”.No.  That’s not how it works.Basing our expectations on this appeal makes us blind to other, malevolent gods…exactly as they would wish it, if they were sentient. Nature resorts to camoflage quite often.Most Juice are normal, but some veer or even plunge into the Infected side of their spectrum. This percentage exists in all populations, but some are more prone to the psychosis, the Infection.

            There is a term I occasionally hear from Jewish professionals, called “servant master”.  It is not something you can Google, but it appears to be a sort of an insider code phrase.  The idea that the 110 IQ (((masters))) appear as servants to their intellectual and professional underlings, even as they actually function as the masters.  Sort of a “pulling the wool over the eyes” of the rest of us.  Part of this is the attitude that only they know the real score of how things work, but they must not let on, so they work to keep us “muppets” (to use the Goldman Sachs term) happy and unaware.  (Trump has a bit of this “servant master” thing going on, personally).On the other side, there is the 80 IQ Muslim thing, a great tool for intimidation and getting the “gibs”, when the people involved don’t have the mental tools to otherwise compete.We are caught in the middle, intellectually, socially, and from a theology standpoint.  I don’t know how much of this is orchestrated or planned out by others, but we in the middle end up being twisted all over the place, at war with each other, and afraid of our own shadows.  A cultural version of the middle child syndrome.

                There are – SADLY – Jews who harbor enormous resentment for the abuses we’ve received at the hands of Christians.  Not just the Nazis, but across history.And, yes, in all honesty sometimes I do too.  But at the same time, as one national example, America has been enormously good to Jews overall.  I won the lottery by being born here… and my love for America and our unique Constitution are things that hold me back from considering Aliyah… after all, if I move to Israel, while I’d retain my American citizenship (as an escape route if needed) it would not be honorable to vote here if I lived there.  (It’d be one thing if work took me there temporarily, but not in a permanent move).At some point guilt and grudges need to end.  Jews were horrifically treated by Spain… hundreds of years ago.  It’s not right to punish those alive now for crimes done then.  Same for other countries.

                    Oh golly gee whiz, how awful to hear about the “abuses” you special, special people “received at the hands of Christians . . . across history.”  Through no fault of your own, no doubt, because you’re special, after all, and eternal victims.  And all the while you proclaim you are one of ‘us.’ – why, you even have a magapede little skullcap.  How . . . quaint.If it’s merely muh magic constitution that prevents you from returning to your homeland, then good news!  You need delay no longer.  It’s a dead letter and is not regarded as sacred writ by most hard right dissidents – as a a matter of fact, it’s utterly insufficient for any ethnostate, so take it along with my best regards on your upcoming voyage home.

        As someone who lived through the purging of the paleocons, such as Sam Francis, Joe Sobran, Peter Brimelow and others, the death of neoconservatism brings me great joy.  But somehow, it doesn’t feel like it’s dead.  We still have open borders, still have high rates of legal immigration, pundits with views like Francis and Sobran are banned, troops are still in the Middle East, and free trade is still dominant.  While I get a kick out of seeing Kristol and Boot ridiculed, I’ll wait on any celebration until we see real change.

            It is anything but dead. Z uses this theatric description of a few nominal neocon pundits embarassing themselves to much effect, but it is all sound and no fury. The brilliance of the  necon machine is that it serves the power elite and therefor needs no public base of support. It can be slightly modified and re-introduced to either party and that is precisely what is being done with both parties today. The DNC has been gaslit into supporting effectively neocon 1.0 reganism with a veil of progspeak. The GOP is being seeded with neocon 2.0 trumpism, which is the appearance of reform with as little reform as possible.

The OT is a manual for the war.The NT is a manual for the peace.

        These folks are great at Motte and Bailey tactics regarding so-called anti-semitism. I have never seen any ill feeling for Jews from Pat Buchanan. To tar him as ‘evil’ was one of the worst things the neocons ever did. Heck in my younger, more vulnerable years, they had me actually believing it without even seeing any evidence.

So I hope that whether that was a false alarm or the real thing, you have some contingency plan as I’m certain they would be more than happy to pull the plug on you w/o notice at this point.

        Dead wrong.
We are still trying to topple Maduro, Assad and try figuring out a way to start a war with Iran. We are permanently occupying Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Syria. We’re supporting a war in Yemen. we have military actions going on in Somalia, Central Africa, etc.
Trump now supports open borders.
I’d say the Neocons have won big with Trump. He’s their puppet.

        Trump has upset the apple cart. The Deep State thought they would succeed in killing him off and restoring their preeminence/vision for remaking mankind as a hive/herd species. But they are now losing that battle as manifest in the coup failure and Mueller fiasco. Smart Jews are jumping ship and pretending to migrate to the other side. It’s an illusion. Their DNA is not wired for freedom-loving pioneer spirit. It’s no one’s fault. It’s just evolutionary history. A zebra cannot changes in stripes.

            Its not just Jews . Jews are typically city folk and city folks regardless of race tend to bigger government as they are dependent on complexity to survive.This cultural clash is really about city v. country or more precisely “serfs” city folk and people dependent on complexity and the “yeomanry” people who are culturally and at least to a higher degree less dependent on that complexityThese cultures usually are quite different but the radical differences and the amount of harm the cities are doing to the country is unprecedented and if things go hot, will lead to pretty horrible outcomes

        So he and his ilk helped ruin Conservatism and now wants to bury the knife in what is left of the Paleos. And yes, by calling himself one that is what he wants to accomplish. He is old though and doesn’t lead anymore. Also, most Paleos, and even little old me, are irrelevant now.You know, the term anti-semitism is thrown out so cavalierly now one forgets as to why it should even be a term. Lots of anti ethnic and religious feelings out there but because of the holocaust and jewish power it is supposed to mean something deep and dark.

            I know Mr. Z. would rather put the WWII baggage aside, but the Hall of Cost is central to Jewish power. “Oh, G_d, if you White goyim organize, it automatically leads to death camps!”
It’s why I believe it should be attacked, whatever actually happened. (I find the official story ridiculous.) Even the slightest criticisms of Jewish power become literally another Shoah. They traumatize children with the story in school and keep up the propaganda with garbage like Swindler’s List. We can’t even think straight anymore because every issue somehow has to be seen through the lens of Jewish persecution.

                    Just look around this country – at how many Holocaust Museums there are.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holocaust_memorials_and_museums_in_the_United_StatesI was in Boston last fall – there was an exhibit lining the sidewalks on the common – with large poster-sized pictures of people who supposedly perished in the “Holocaust”.I told the wife I was sick and tired of this stuff.  It’s 2000 and freaking 18.  WW2 ended in 1945.  Most of the people who were there when it happened – are dead and gone.  There’s 73 years between the end of the war  and now.  Were people in the -&gt; US &lt;-still having interactive exhibits of the casualties from the US Civil War right before the beginning of WW2?   Were they even spending much time thinking about it any more?  I felt like it was a very appropriate question to ask – seeing as how US Civil War casualties  were very high – and it&#x27;s something that affected THIS country.  Holocaust victims came from Europe for the most part, and it was right around the timeHow much rememberance of the Armenian genocide is there in the US?  How much is there even of US WW1 and WW2 or even Vietnam war dead for that matter?I find it odd – and actually a bit annoying that events from almost 75 years ago are constantly &quot;remembered&quot; – to the exclusion of actual US history.When I point things like this out – in a matter of fact way – I find it actually makes an impression on people.  The wife in particular has taken to saying &quot; god I&#x27;m sick of hearing of jew this and jew that constantly&quot;

Still sticking with the reading comprehension issue I see.
And no – Jews are not living rent free in my head.
What they are doing however is living larger than they would otherwise by benefit of my tax dollars.
It’s a pretty simple point to illustrate by just detailing how much money gets sent to the country of Israel – directly from the pockets of US taxpayers,  even though Israel is NOT a poor country.

                                        Wikipedia says almost $3.2B in US military assistance to Israel in 2017, a nice bit of change for the military-industrial complex here, but that’s not enough for many in Israel to live large on, and small beer in the US budget. No, you definitely have Jews living free between your ears, and hearing about it incessantly from you and others here is past tiresome. Get a life.

                        Exactly.Better yet, go straight to the point: ask someone “How many people were killed in WWII?” You’ll invariably get, “Well, there were 6 million Jews, and uh …um ….”

                The Right Stuff guys hit on this a couple months back talking about the Beer Pong Shoah.  Zoomers are rejecting the endless moralizing and obsession with their great-grandparents’ wars, to the point where they make Nazi references just to piss off the blue-noses preaching to them. “Normalizing” the Hall of Cost (in the sense of “your six million are not more important than Russia’s 20 million” etc) is a good first step to reclaiming our own history from the special people.

                Whether the paleoconservative portion of the article is correct or not ( I haven’t checked) – the most important piece of information that has shown up here is in the comments:” “Well, to me,” said Poddy, “the Civil War is as remote and as irrelevant as the War of the Roses.” I realized then that he was not planning to become an “assimilated American,” to use the old-fashioned terminology; but, rather, his first loyalty would always be to Israel. Yet he and Midge stay on among us, in order to make propaganda and raise money for Israel–a country they don’t seem eager to live in. ”Podhoretz reveals that he doesn’t REALLY want to be one with this country.  That alone is reason for expulsion.  The fact that he’s a neocon should be a close second.  Neoconservativism is (to paraphrase Garet Garrett:it took off from nothing that was implicit in the American scheme.I warned my “conservative” friends at least 20 years ago that all of those people calling themselves neocons should be viewed as leftist fifth columnists.  When the wars came – I warned them harder.  They didn’t listen.  I could also see that the Neocons were hastening their own demise in the longer term.The worm is turning…..now….. finally.Podhoretz and his ilk are traitors to this country.  They should be treated as such.

                    The article got it right, you just misread it. And persist in doing so.
Unlike the Wars of the Roses the War of Northern Aggression was not, in fact, a civil war, so there’s that.

        Got to give a shout-out to Twitter. Despite their suppression of rightists, the stuff that gets through about the Jews, but perhaps even morewhat the Jews themselves say,creates sort of super-strength redpills on the JQ.
I was a sort of normie libertarian with some HBD leanings when I got on Twitter, but now I’m really,reallyright wing.
Future historians may be too embarrassed to write it, and therefore knowledge of the fact may go out of existence in the long run, but make no mistake about it: World War III will have been caused by Twitter.

            Absolutely.  Shapeshifters.In their early days, when Abraham the Lucifer still worshipped Dzhumid and Ninil, they were the cult of the Bride Stealers.The white Kievan Rus defeated a colony, Khazaria, that had dominated the region for 3 centuries.The white Romans, with Greek auxilaries, defeated Israel on the plains of Har Megiddo (Armageddon), then lifted the Heretic to deity.Both must be destroyed, that rightful Rule may come.(This is the covenant with the volcano demon, so dread that none dare mention his name, and his half-brother, the demon of the Ka’aba , a fallen meteor where human sacrifices were once performed.)Stalin’s Purge sent the Trotskyites and Bolsheviks West as conquistadors, where they resumed their long fight with each other as Right and Left.

        An oldie but goodie:  Lefty Gore Vidal’s piece, “The Empire Lovers Strike Back,” originally published in The Nation in 1986.  I reproduced the most interesting part:Significantly, the one Yiddish word that has gained universal acceptance in this country is chutzpah. Example: In 1960, Mr. and Mrs. Podhoretz were in upstate New York where I used to live. I was trying out a play at the Hyde Park Playhouse; the play was set during the Civil War. “Why,” asked Poddy, “are you writing a play about, of all things, the Civil War?” I explained to him that my mother’s family had fought for the Confederacy and my father’s for the Union, and that the Civil War was–and is–to the United States what the Trojan War was to the Greeks, the great single tragic event that continues to give resonance to our Republic.“Well, to me,” said Poddy, “the Civil War is as remote and as irrelevant as the War of the Roses.” I realized then that he was not planning to become an “assimilated American,” to use the old-fashioned terminology; but, rather, his first loyalty would always be to Israel. Yet he and Midge stay on among us, in order to make propaganda and raise money for Israel–a country they don’t seem eager to live in. Jewish joke, circa 1900: A Zionist is someone who wants to ship other people off to Palestine.http://www.thecactusland.com/2010/06/empire-lovers-strike-back.htmlPodhoretz’s response in Commentary:https://www.commentarymagazine.com/culture-civilization/history/gore-vidal-and-the-hate-that-dare-not-speak-its-name/

            Ha ha!  That joke was on patriotic, German-Jewish nationalists.  Israel is a holding pen, a penal colony.
My own Converso ancestors came here in 1651 to get away from their insane Talmudic family, who got rich funding religious wars.

        I think JPod is just trying to re-brand himself to better swim in hostile waters. Outside his genuine and spontaneous sprees of Ashkepathic paranoia, what he says is most always contrived for effect. Like other “reformed” Never Trumpers (Beck, Shapiro), they are merely changing their coloration, not their agenda. Trump sadly would rather appease these Fifth Columnists than his base.  I will shed no tears for him when these newfound friends give him the Ides of March treatment.  What about “never cuck” was so hard to understand?  I hate to black-pill on a Monday, but I suspect there’s a lot of ruin left in the neocons.

        Neoconservatism’s fall is a great reminder that the Right is not supposed to be a vacuum cleaner for the Left’s disaffected spin-offs. It’s possible to find common ground with disgruntled former members of mainstream leftism, but caution, judiciousness, and a willingness to purge when necessary will win the day moving forward.

        The blank slate vs. cultural conditions argument for why neoconservatism failed is really not much of distinction.  I think the idea sweeping the Right the West now, whether it’s called this not, is the importance of social trust in highly functioning societies.  Good formal political and economic institutions are nice, but very secondary.  The folly of “invade the world, invite the world” becomes obvious if takes the idea of the importance of social trust seriously.

        Is Podhoretz’s change of heart a sign that the R donor class money may be drying up for this stuff?  Probably wishful thinking.  Romney’s insane rant over the Mueller report suggests that the R donor class wants Trump to lose in 2020.  There is no way any R insider doesn’t know that the Mueller investigation was part of the attempted coup.

                Romney was one of three founding partners of Bain Capital. The purpose of BC was/is to buy struggling companies and streamlining them-whipping them into being “efficient and profitable.”Romney is an open-borders globalist, a carpetbagger, and he’s at home in any port he briefly anchors, until that port is of no use to him, then he sails on to the next port. He may be nice to his dog, but he’s not nice to the world.He has shapeshifted into the new-action John McCain, has a thin skin, has small hands and an inflamed ego, and hates Trump expressed as a never Trumper. He’s a terminal wuss but the SOB can make money.  I cringe when he is the first to jump on the piano bench, swish his skirts, clutch his pearls and squeal at the Trump mouse. God what a puss! I thought that shit would stop when Mia Love got trounced. Wrong! Wow- did my respect go down for my Mormon neighbors here in Southern Utah when they went extreme herd animal and elected him to the Senate.Without a doubt he was the pick by the LDS church management.Because he is the reincarnate of John McCain derangement syndrome, expect to see this horse’s ass to be front and center screaming at Trump ad infinitum. So unseemly and embarrassing. Do not in any way trust this Romney weasel.

                    I live an a small California city that was historically Mormon.  Most of the movers and shakers still are Mormon, though they like to operate in the shadows.  There was a lot of quiet pride when Romney got the nomination in 2012.  Not seeing so much of it now.  The different things going on now in the church must be roiling the old guard, I suspect.  As for Bain, go into a Staples store, one of their deals.  No one in charge, all minimum wage, and not much happiness or pride in their employer going on.  Simply a retail emotional dead space.  The Bain Capitalists have kept the place, and the people, stripped bare.  The future for all of us, if we are not careful.

                        “The different things going on now in the church must be roiling the old guard”Could this be what roils the old guard?I wrote on 4/17– The LDS church made a slide to the left a couple weeks ago.  They are “inspired” to now allow children of gay people, members or not, to be baptised. And being gay in the church does not constitute an apostasy anymore.  It’s been downgraded to a naughty.So there we go and saw this coming a long way off.  The church is growing by conversion from mainly Central and South America.  It is losing young people stateside so hence the appeal to Gay inclusion. This is also about flying under the Imperial Capitol radar and tax exempt status.It will come to a head over gun rights when the church will side with Imperial Capitol, members outside of the US don’t care, and Int. Mountain west members will get thrown under the bus. Follow the money.

                    “The purpose of BC was/is to buy struggling companies and streamlining them-whipping them into being “efficient and profitable.””You’re missing the part played by crony capitalism in this. At least in the case of the steel company that Bain bought, cashed out of, and that later had to be sold off for pennies on the dollar (that of the 2012 Democrat ads claiming Romney killed some worker’s wife) the selling point for investors seems to have been Romney’s ability to lobby for and get tariff protection for steel wire products.  Which he got, though it wasn’t enough to keep the business viable in the event. In other words the secret sauce for Bain is political pull, not “streamlining” or introducing any other actual efficiency.

                I get what you were saying there. With people like Podhoretz recanting a bit of the ideology and the GOP base picking a candidate like Trump, there’s been some disenchantment with neoconservatism. Our fruitless wars have given the brand a bit of a tarnish, like Jack in the Box after an E. coli outbreak. To me though, it seems a bit early for eulogies when neocons are so obviously still in power. Nearly 30 years after the fall of the USSR and Bernie Sanders is a likely candidate for president. Jack in the Box survived O157:H7. Ideologies can have troughs and peaks. There are vested interests in keeping neoconservatism alive. The fact that it has currently fallen out of popularity among us hoi polloi isn’t a guaranteed death knell for an ideology that was never grassroots to begin with. But I hope I’m wrong.

An inversion on the “kill’em all; God’ll recognize his own.” Interesting, if arrogant, boomer take on executing the exact kind of purification Mao and Stalin took. At least you’re honest. I’m more favorable towards more precise removal a people instead of wholesale slaughtering, but the sentiment is understandable.

        One of the blind spots I see for the dissident right is it’s flat out refusal to engage in or recognize realpolitik. It’s potentially fatal and will leave the movement wide open to groups that do.
The Iraq war and the one in Afghanistan were not about imposing democracy on cavemen.

            I think the warmongering is a combination of things. We know guys like Bill Kristol saw it as a way to help Israel. That said, I think many of the neocons have the same weird obsession with Israel as Evangelicals. It’s not about Israel the country, but Israel the symbol. I also know many of the neocons really believed they could democratize the world. They looked at Europe and Asia and said, “If we can force democracy on those people, it can be done to the Muslims.”As I said in my podcast, some portion of American Jews are just nuts. They are the dominant portion, so we see it every day. The collapse of neoconservatism could signal a larger collapse of the crazy wing of the Tribe. I think if you an optimist, that would be a good result.

                Evangelicals think they are busy ushering in the eschaton. Most cannot be educated otherwise since they read ‘Israel’ in their Bible and then see ‘Israel’ on a map and assume they’re the same thing – no amount of rational argument will work with them.

                    Mentioning that today’s neocons like Max Boot are just versions of the Pharisees gains a little traction.  Evangelicals will never become anti-Semites, but they are open to criticizing those who are deceptive and disingenuous.

                            Interesting… because realizing that was kind of a turning point for me. But at the same time, I was also being exposed to a lot of Jewish religious thought straight from the horse’s mouth.I, myself, have a reputation for knowing my Old Testament better than most and my faith has been a hobby in theology and history since I was a kid. What I was hearing from these religious Jews was the exact opposite of what comes out of the OT. It sounded like distortion (an not of God).I’ve far more antipathy than I used to have.But I also find the attempts to usher in the eschaton as christians playing the part of Judas Iscariot – trying to rush Jesus along and force his hand in our time, not his. Ultimately, they are making a mistake.

                        Exactly correct, even in the New Testament, there were “good” Jews and “bad” Jews, like some of the Pharisees, as you said.
The insightful statement you made tells me you have an understanding of the basis of Evangelicals’ values, namely the Bible, particularly the New Testament.  The New Testament is something that atheists and Jews (in some cases, the same person) will not stoop to even read, so they will always misunderstand the motives of Evangelical Christians, leaving these haters spewing nonsense like “Evangelicals want to imminatize the eschaton.”

He is easy prey for the Judo move that claims any leftist goal like gay stuff is a pro individual rights issue and therefore a conservative value.

These so-called “evangelicals” (they are nothing of the sort) “turn the Lord’s glory into shame” by “running after false gods.” Their so-called “evangelicalism” is IN FACT nothing more than grotesque superstition.

                            The error of most evangelicals is their acceptance of the Schofield Bible. If they don’t believe that the British and U.S. whites are descendants of the lost tribes, they at least believe the Jewish people are still the chosen ones. An old fashioned Inquisition would have been nice around the early 1900’s.

                        I have had multiple people tell me that we are living in the end times because Israel is now a country again and its up to Christians to convert the Jews so that Jesus will return. These are not just some backwoods snake handlers. One went so far as to say that God has a separate covenant for the Jews so they don’t have to follow any of Christianity. This is what happens when scripture is divorced from tradition. The orthodox and catholics have their differences but they are both right about protestantism. Our modern anti-Christian society is a direct outgrowth of Luther and Calvin.

                            Your ignorance of Luther is appalling, although everything else you say is right. Very odd. But it’s your unthinking–and uninformed–prejudice, which is understandable although not excusable.  Like 90% of Americans, you know less than nothing about Luther or Lutheranism, which is properly called Evangelical-Catholicism anyway.

                    A new book published by the Evangelical-Lutheran Diocese of North America (eldona.org), titled “An Introduction to the Catholic Faith,” point-blank condemns millennialism in all its forms (all bizarre superstitions); Zionism, AND so-called “Christian” Zionism.

                    I don’t know if this is still a thing, but when I was a young guy, Jewish parents would send their kids to Israel for a graduation gift. I knew a couple of guys who went the summer after they graduated from college. They came back as anti-Semites. It seems this is a well known phenomenon among Jewish men in America.

                        Still is.  The mostly Israeli Jews I’ve worked with all send their kids home around graduation and definitely encouraged their American Jewish colleagues to do so.  I can’t speak for the boys, but I know two of their girls that couldn’t marry goys fast enough when they came home.  IDF-lifer father was most upset, and mama is still kvetching 3 years after the weddings.

                Since most neocons are only residually religious, muh Israel occupies much of that mindspace for them, for all that Boot’s sub-tribe seems more obsessed with revenging themselves on the Cossacks than with Israel itself.  Heartiste did it tongue-in-cheek, but his “worrier-warrior” piece, taking Sailer’s material to places Steve fears to tread, struck a note of truth for me.  Even “based Jews” I know have a strong, unusual combination of paranoia and bellicosity.  For those into “Enneagram” personality dynamics, they’re a race of “counter-phobic Sixes.”

                The evangelicals don’t understand realpolitik either – but the Neocons do, which is why the Neocons can manipulate them.
Nor was it warmongering. In international geopolitics, many of the players are literally mass murderers and you have to be able to treat them that way that way when you deal with them.
What is the dissident right’s opinion on the American Empire Z? Is there one? Writing off the sandbox wars as mere jingoism is hopelessly naïve and I hope the movement is above that.

                A close friend of mine – another Jew (and former military) and someone who left our SJW-led congregation* – was ecstatic when the Afghan pullout was announced.  Or was it the Syrian pullout?  Either way, they were very happy.  As was I, though with some doubts.No, I was not obsessed with Israel’s safety per se, though that is a high concern of mine.  Rather, Afghanistan is a quagmire no matter what.  They rightly say “You have the clocks, we have the time”.  The only way to “reform” it is to scrape it clean and start over, and at least at present no western country has that kind of will.  Syria?  Assad is a monster, a butcher, and no doubt deserves everything he’s got coming in the world to come.  But… he’s also focused on this side of the veil, which means we have leverage.  The Islamic nutjobs?  They’re focused on their 72 virgins, which means they’re not controllable.  Let HIM spend HIS money and blood on that, not us.* Our shul has a SJW for a rabbi.  Alas.  But since my wife’s not Jewish, she likes him.  With our children being Jewish by conversion, and my efforts to raise them as Jews, I take what I can get.

            Neither Saddam Hussein nor the Iraqi people attacked the US on 911. Kicking their ass in war was hubris, not retribution or remedy. There never has been a country of Afghanistan. It is and always has been an amorphous and chaotic tribal region. We are not now and never have been fighting a war there. We are an occupation force trying to intimidate the locals into subservience. Both “wars” were a needless waste of young lives and national treasure.

Last time I looked it was Bush the wrinkled who attacked Iraq the first time and his shiftless witless son who perpetrated the second slaughter and that in Afghanistan and we should not forget Slick Willies crimes in Somalia, and Barry the Kenyans atrocities in Libya and Syria were relatively minor in slaying only tens of thousands not millions.Not a Neo-con amongst them and the self styled conservatives the biggest killers.

                        If you think the Bushes were conservative, I don’t know what to tell you.  Maybe start by looking up Wolfowitz, Eagleburger, Perle, Abrams, Kristol (yes, he was Quayle’s chief of staff).  Cheney and Rumsfeld relied heavily on neo-conservative advisors under Bush the Dumber.  Max Boot reached the height of his influence during this era.  Willie and Barry are covered under “lefty leaders.”  Other than that, I agree with your post.

Reading comprehension fail.
bilejones even started his response by quoting  ” But our neocon and lefty leaders sure love to use our military”, sp there’s not much excuse for failing to understand what he was refuting.

                    Having been to Iran pre-revolution, albeit as a young’un, I remember it fondly.  The people we met – admittedly not a random sampling of the people there – were warm, friendly, and modern (as shown in many pictures of the time).  People from Iran that I meet now are, also, pretty darned secular and consistent over time in that.
I was outraged over Carter’s stabbing the Shah in the back.  The Shah was doing his best to drag his nation forward.
What a loss.

                Iraq was mainly about Iran and trying to hem them in between Afghanistan and Iraq.  (Stuck between Iraq and a hard place? Anyway…)  Iran was (and is) mainly about Israel.  I still think had Iraq gone “well”, however you choose to define it, that the next step was going to be Iran.  But it turned out a bit like the Underpants Gnomes in South Park.  (Phase 1: Collect Underpants.  Phase 2: ?  Phase 3: Profit!)
Nobody really seemed to have thought through Phase 2.

        Iraq was the neocons biggest moment, and biggest disaster.  So far.  They’re only in decline on the ideas/acceptance front.  Sadly, they’re fully ensconced within the Trump administration which can take one of two directions at this point (the firing of John Bolton and allies) or (war with Iran).  It’s absolutely feasible that we go to war with Iran, which would be an unmitigated disaster for both countries, and led by people who lost their moral quiver, and in a bizarre way are trying to get it back by stirring up potential enemies overseas.  It may be very WW1 like.  The early 19th century regimes trying to keep legitimacy in rapidly changing times in a new century.  Of course those regimes were wiped off the map.If you look at the two decades proceeding WW1, the old regimes were already slipping.  The disastrous Boer wars, The Russo-Japanese war.  Different times, different politics, but the same long-in-the-tooth regime problems.  Iraq may well be our own version of a Boer war before something far worse.

                        You focus on one metric and then determine there are no similarities shared by those wars.
Technological changes allowed the sanguinary costs for the British in southern Africa to be converted into materiel losses for the Americans in Vietnam and Somalia. In Lebanon and Somalia the American military was less able to apply its material advantage and the kill ratios became much less favorable.
The wars are indicative of a hegemonic power  on the wane.

But we should see this period as giving rise to what we now refer to as the neocons.  We make problems for ourselves then the jews exploit it to their benefit: the jews convincing the Brits and French to not seek a peace in 2016 was the beginning of all our present troubles.

        The neocons “success” in open immigration came only because it encountered no resistance from the left, and therefore no resistance from the mainstream media.
The “success” of the freedom agenda happened despite opposition from the left, and only because the USSR collapsed, which they didn’t even see coming.
Had the USSR held on another couple decades, and continued to support regimes hostile to NATO, who knows how things would have unfolded, but going by Iraq, Libya, and Syria, probably not too well.
As for advancing conservatism they were a complete failure. The left only grew in power under their watch.

            From 1990 to 2000, the white TFR went up, and in 2004 there were a number of “Bush Democrat” Hispanics. The ’08, ’12 and ’16 blowouts for the Dems with Asians would have been a surprise to an observer in 2000, Asians were the strongest GOP bloc in ’92 having no sympathy for Perot.
Blame them for looking at the data with tinted glasses, but there were reasons in favor of their stances, at a time when rural whites were still electing a lot of Dems.

Venezuela and MesoAmerica is being prepared for a Latin Spring rush into the U.S.  We will shatter and balkanize under the onslaught, ripe pickings for the emergent Eurasian Empire.

        I worked on a book on neoconservatism ten or tweove years ago. The comtext was the “campaign to save Soviet Jews”. I forget the details, but the main contention was that neoconservative movement grew out of that campaign.

            IIRC, the neocons grew out of the “New York Intellectuals” a group of Trotsky supporting Jewish students in the City Colleges. Some of them went on to get CIA funding, where the non-Stalinist left was paid to switch sides by something called the Congress of Cultural Freedom. Gloria Steinem was also paid by the CIA.

                My own memory: Irving Kristol wrote about this stuff in his ‘Reflections of a Neoconservative’. It’s a good read; it’s honest.
Our minds were so addled with the Soviet threat in those days that ANYONE who acknowledged the reality of that threat was accepted as a ‘conservative’, even “evolved” Trotskyites like Kristol.

        Norman Podhoretz seems to have undergone more ideological metamorphoses than a butterfly. I hadn’t noticed his latest break with neoconservatism. For all that, he’s a good writer. His autobiographical stuff (“Making It,” “Breaking Ranks,” “Ex-friends”) documents the ideological development of the Left in the mid-20th century, and has some excellent vignettes of some of the more prominent intellectuals of the day. I love his description of Mary McCarthy – “Our leading bitch intellectual.” She was actually a good novelist. See, for example, “The Group.” She was basically a talented Jane Fonda. In spite of that she’s more or less forgotten today, perhaps because she was much too ingenuous about Communist influence on the culture, media, academia, etc., in the 30’s and 40’s. Among other things, Podhoretz’ three books noted above describe an important aspect of human nature – our ubiquitous tendency to perceive others in terms of ingroups and outgroups. He describes what happened when he became a heretic to his leftist ingroup, defined, as many ingroups are today, by ideology. He was ostracized, vilified, and cast into outer darkness. In the case of Norman Mailer, he noted a characteristic of many leftist thinkers today; their ability to challenge the ideological shibboleths of their ingroup, but then redeem themselves at the last moment by adept virtue signaling. Pinker is a similar type, and one can find many other examples at Quillette.

        Podhoretz calling himself a “Paleo-con” was a joke.  A mocking, little “Victory Dance” joke. But still a Joke. It looks like some people need a humor transplant.  And I don’t feel sorry for the Paleo-cons. They wanted to lose. They were happy they lost. Being a “good loser” is what they strove for – and they succeeded.

                The black unemployment line is great for convincing skeptical white moderates. It doesn’t work with blacks because their rate is still three points ahead of the white rate, and their earnings are lower (which they mistakenly credit to discrimination). U6 unemployment is still 7%, above the 5% that is considered to be full employment.

I agree that whites love to talk about low black unemployment rates under Trump.  A friend of mine brings it up all the time, out of the blue.  I quietly laugh at him for his unrequited concern for blacks.

        Off topic:
Does anyone else find Trump’s dodging on the tax returns question annoying? This is roughly comparable to the birth certificate Obama issue, and Trump thinks its weak to cough up the returns, given that he got Obama to cough up the long-form. But in terms of working class voters, this looks like more hypocrisy.
I want the returns from Kushner Cos too.

            IMO. Trump sees their obsession with his tax returns as giving him leverage.  It’s something that they want bigly, so he’s not going to just give it to them without getting something of equal value in return.

            The tax returns are a fall back seditious conspiracy now that Mueller failed dig up any dirt.  They are just trying to give friendly state AGs a shot at prosecuting Trump (and tarring everyone near him) for tax/disclosure nonsense now that the feds blew their wad and missed. It’s the NCAA principle – make the rules so complex that anyone can get caught, given enough scrutiny.  Here’s your “enough scrutiny.” Just more deep state bS to make it impossible for Trump to do anything of consequence

                    That’s right. The difference between Steyn and Shapiro, for example, is not trying to keep people from hearing our ideas. Shapiro’s main mission is to function as a gatekeeper. As an aside, I’ll note that the neocons at NRO had no problem colluding to usher Steyn out of the respectable circles. Jonah Goldberg did nothing to defend Steyn.

He took on the Canadian effort to suppress dissident speech, and the Michael Mann effort to block dissent with lawsuits, by spending unimaginable hours in courtrooms.

                        Yup, the media owners smeared and blacklisted Steyn, just as they did an actual Juice, Michael Savage, after Savage gave Trump a voice in the national stage.Savage dominates every market he enters, so they won’t let him in.Shapiro is almost certainly the same media corp that gives us Hannity and Levin.  Can’t escape the barking puppy on the dial now, anywhere in the country.Zman is correct in saying they police their ranks, but the policing goes the wrong way.Thanks for mentioning that gaslighting back-stabber Levin.His lawyers slandered Steyn’s reputation and character, as a person, while Levin was screwing him over.  Surprised he didn’t pull an O’Reilly assassination on him.

                    Well, he’s still in court for calling Mann the “Jerry Sandusky of climate science” for molesting data and for calling Mann’s hockey-stick graph “fraudulent”.  Then he got after the judge and his lawyers dumped him.  There’s large balls and then there’s common sense, and I wonder sometimes if his ego isn’t out in front of his mouth sometimes.

                        Maybe. But National Review is also being sued by Mann for the same “offense”, and they severed their legal efforts from Steyn’s due to his impetuosity and willingness to fight.  How are their much more decorous efforts working out?  They’re no further ahead than Steyn.  If playing it safe results in the exact same results as flinging the plates around, you might as well have some fun while you’re being legally bankrupted by the crooked American legal system.

                Two and half cheers for Steyn, definite net positive for the dissident Right.  Still an interventionist, slightly chastened (Coulter seems further along on that evolution), and gushingly philo-Semitic, but he has paid a large personal cost for speaking inconvenient truth to power.  Not “our guy” necessarily but he’s no grifter.

            Mark Steyn is one of my heroes. He goes toe-to-toe with the enemy in a place that actually matters – in court. His passion is free speech, and he is rather good at it.
In normal times, he’d be our Mencken, a widely-read and quoted commentator on the follies of our age. But no, now he is a virtual leper.
At a guess, Steyn wouldn’t lose sleep over ‘not being your man’.

                I always thought Episcopalians were the chosen people right up through the consecration of Gene Robinson as bishop of NH in 2003, but I’m not getting into any theological disputes on Easter Monday. As far as I’m concerned, Jews and all the other white ethnics are fungible, particularly when they inhabit cities on the East Coast. You can safely ignore Shapiro because he’s boring and spergy. I don’t ignore Podhoretz because he writes exceptionally well and he’s unusually honest. You’re obsessed.

Who are my co-ethnics and how much of a defense was it to point out that Shapiro apologized for his stupid remark? You’re free to reject his apology. In any case, a stupid remark isn’t “worst behavior” because we still live in a 1st Amendment country. It’s just a stupid remark. As for biological determinism, if you’re in here, you’re not in here to debate the filioque clause or theories of predestination: you’re a biological determinist.

                “You are not the chosen people, we are.”
Far, far more true than you, any of you, know right now.The White race and culture is the fortunate happenstance, the highest culmination yet of millions of years of unceasing Purpose.
That includes their god, the archetype called Lord Jesus.As an atheist, I believe this wholeheartedly.I would kneel, kiss the Cross, and lift the sword should they decide to kill demons, the torturers.

But would you Believe?
I’m a Christian Ally and a proudGrundtvigianatheist myself, but our Second Renaissance must build on something other than religion.

                        To say I could Believe would be a lie.  Born that way, my mind doesn’t work like that.

Semantics is bullshit, and the pre-moderns didn’t have the technological concepts we do.Their tangled tapestry is like an aboriginal trying to explain an automobile engine.

                            I’m trying to to put together part of that something.Faith based on technical knowledge, not doubt and hope and gas.
I found the sages can’t actually answer or explain anything.Why we’re here, why we suffer, what happens next.  Then they tell you you can”t know either.
