        ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been mulling a rework of the site‚Äôs look and feel. The main reason is to keep it fresh, ‚Ä¶‚Äù
Please don‚Äôt change the site. It looks great now, and some of us are dead set against change. Tradition! Give me tradition. üôÇ

            Amen. A well regarded site of this ilk drastically changed format a couple of months ago, and now, reading it is like wading through molasses. These days, I just skim the headings instead of reading it, and rarely comment. From the looks of his comment numbers I suspect a lot of others are doing the same.

                    The winds always buffeted me. Never figured out how to buffet them back. Of course that was 40-60 years ago. They probably now have an iPhone app that lets the pilot buffet the winds.

        I‚Äôve been trying out the Brave browser this week. So far so good. It‚Äôs founder is Brandon Eich, who is famous for being ousted from Mozilla for his paltry donation to Prop 8.
The browser itself has a big emphasis on privacy and ad-blocking, and purports to be faster as a result. It definitely feels zippier and all my usual sites are rendering just fine. Recommended.

        No, thank you! #wizdomYou could upload to archive.org, apparently it‚Äôs free:https://turbofuture.com/internet/How-to-Host-Podcast-Audio-on-ArchiveorgAnd while VDARE is struggling, the SPLC is on a roll:The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Profits of HateMake no mistake: hate makes a great business model for those pretending to fight it.‚ÄúIn their 2015 declaration (the most recent available to the public), the SPLC admits to $58.2 million in revenue and‚Ä¶(are you ready for it)‚Ä¶a staggering $328.4 million in net assets. That‚Äôs right, this ‚Äúnonprofit‚Äù legal advocacy group, this ragtag bunch of civil rights lawyers and anti-hate do-gooders, now has a war chest totaling 1/3 of a billion dollars.

        Glad to hear that your audience is growing, and that is both a credit to you and a reflection of the appeal of your writing content and style. There was a time when ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù was common, but not any more. You seem to embody that characteristic in your messaging, so perhaps a common sense Renaissance is in our future also.

        Thought it was just me that hates summer. Absolutely can‚Äôt stand the heat, and the season has a deadness about it with everyone gone from their homes to go to their summer homes and vacations, such a feeling of ennui.

            Damn, wish I‚Äôd thought of that ‚Äúennui‚Äù description. As it is, I‚Äôm just regarded as a cranky guy who doesn‚Äôt like sunshine and heat. Years ago started doing my 10K run predawn ‚Äì stars and quiet, just a few coyotes who nod and keep going. Arriving home as sun comes up.

        Some German social scientist visited a subtropical tribe that lay around for most of the time, yet would dance frenetically when the spirit hit them (and they were drunk) for like 36 hours straight. These sun people could exert themselves, but only in spurts and when the mood hit them. When this German tried to get the natives to do something, like chop trees for eight hours straight, their aversion to work was so strong he called it something like ‚ÄúArbeitschrecken‚Äù (literally ‚Äúwork terror‚Äù). I know some sun people and some ice people with sun people tendencies who exhibit Arbeitschrecken.

        Content is king, form is secondary. Nor is what you look like important. I don‚Äôt know what Sailer or Derbyshire look like and I‚Äôm not anxious to find out. Regarding possible topics for presentations, a series on the top frauds on the left might be fun, both its high priests and it‚Äôs most absurd ideas. We all know who and what they are, but primers aimed at the vast middle might open some eyes.

        I am a daily visitor to your site and generally enjoy the content. I am text-oriented for information gathering‚Äìeither that, or eavesdropping on conversations. Otherwise, I am not big on audible data collection, i.e, listening to podcasts. Takes too long to get to the point, for the way my brain is wired.

        Regarding the search engines, including Qwant,  it appears they all use the same faulty algorithms or simply link back to google for much of their data.
Search, for example on google for ‚ÄòEuropean people history‚Äô and then click on  images and you find the vast majority of folks that made up European history happed to be black. Do the same search on duck duck go &amp; you end up with the same images. Do the same search on Qwant and the same set of images appear.

        Off Topic, but perhaps of interest to readers here.  From the Washington Free Beacon August 31:

Headline:  ‚ÄúSouthern Poverty Law Center Transfers Millions in Cash to Offshore Entities‚Äù

        Let us all take a moment to thank that witless professor, Leonard Jeffries, for giving us the wonderful and incisive distinction between ‚Äòice people‚Äô and ‚Äòsun people‚Äô. Having no feel for irony, Jeffries (like HRC with her disastrous ‚Äòbasket of deplorables‚Äô remark,) had no premonition that such an ‚Äúinsult‚Äù clarifies the battle-lines and rallies the spirit and self-identity of the enemy.

        Z Man;Love your blog.  No reason to change formats (except to allow by-segment playing of the podcasts).  I seem to recall that your home page header was once in color.  But B&amp;W that loads faster is just fine, because content should rule.
However, I have to ask, ‚ÄúHow can an ‚Äòice person‚Äô live in MD_?‚Äù  An actual ice person lives in places where one can drive their trucks on local lakes in the winter.

        As newer reader of yours I do enjoy the podcasts as well. For me that is saying something because I have this audio sensory issue where certain voices make so absolutely crazy I cannot listen to them (Obama‚Äôs voice was a perfect example although not because of his policy; I can only listen to Steyn for so long before I start envisioning murder).  So related to that, might i suggest one of those microphone screens that filter out some of the peripheral noise, such as the lip smacking noises I hear after you take a sip of your coffee.  Keep up the good work.

        I definitely second others calling for some systematic coverage of prog worldview elements; I‚Äôd benefit from some clear ways of organizing just how radically their baselines about the world differ. Struggling toward this myself. Tough to argue all the time when the basic terms, goals, values, ideas are so slippery.If you haven‚Äôt seen The Circle, with Emma Watson, do. It‚Äôs terrible in many ways but as a sort of satire of some elements of Google it had me scared and laughing at once. The late Bill Paxton is one of the more actually human performers.The allegedly happy ending struck me as bowel-watering terrifying. I think it represents the prog world view on some levels.On that, some clarity on how Google keeps manipulating its search results and how to deal with it could be useful. That sort of propaganda strikes as more important than the attention it is getting now.

        Probably won‚Äôt be of any interest to anyone outside of myself, but I have problems with depression. This has always been particularly bad in the coldest months, until the last 2-3 yrs, when it flipped. Now, my depression has manifested itself in the hottest months of the year. I wonder if there‚Äôs ever been on study of depression in women, middle age, and all that jazz. This whole hormone rollercoaster of getting old is not fun, as a woman. Makes me almost have sympathy for the crazy cat ladies.

            Middle aged male here. Developed that on a sporadic basis a few years ago. Then, it was situational- physical health, life, what have you. Little seasonal element to it.Still is mostly situational, and with some of those same elements, but now with the big picture stuff thrown in.The plus side- seasons aren‚Äôt decisive for me. It‚Äôs year round fluctuations.Down side- seasons can have impact at margins. Curiously, for me it‚Äôs the transitions. Winter is worse than summer, but I get used to it. It‚Äôs the autumn anticipation that makes it worse. Spring has its challenges- stupid nature bursting out all over‚Ä¶- but I enjoy the riot of green where I live.FWIW. Just commiserating from another perspective.
