        I too read a lot of econ stuff, STRICTLY for entrainment purposes. Too bad much of it is adulterated by Political Science propaganda.So far, the most useful piece I’ve seen was a series in the Sunday Papers. Prince Valiant ran a series, in essence, “What happens when “suddenly” there’s no salt supply”(consider the time period)MOST of the “academically acclaimed”, or “award winning” stuff I’ve been reading(usually in the hammock/moxie/afternoon nap laboratory) involves “Well, it’s COMPLICATED!”, when in fact, it’s been purposely MADE to be over complicated.Personally, I show more consternation for the nice folks that go out of their way to shut down “other peoples” innovation, than the parasitic rent seekers and patent trolls that feed off them.“Tucker” comes to mind, although many people have foolishly gained hundred thousand dollar pay offs for “rights” to producing, or quashing, trillion dollar “Why didn’t I think of that!” stuff.Also See: Bell Labs, IBM, Ron Popiel(Ronco)

        I was thinking the other day about how so many who now own or manage these billion dollar enterprises that operate in virtual land don’t actually make or do anything substantive.  And I thought of how so many of these appear to disdain or simply ignore those who possess the skills that make and keep the material world around them running.  All of these new titans of wealth (the term “titan of industry” simply doesn’t apply as “industry” implies real production of real products and services} wear shoes, use toilets, drive autos and in general interact with the real world and expect – indeed – demand that the real world measure up to their standards.  Ask any of them about the cobbler, plumber or mechanic and I doubt many, or any, of them could tell you what they do or have a clue as to how they do it.  Yet there is complete reliance on the truly skilled manipulators of the material world and if these should suddenly become unavailable or vanish altogether the “titans” would very quickly find themselves stuffing cardboard in their shoes to plug the holes, crapping into buckets or holes in the back yard because the water ceased to run long ago and walking to get anywhere because the family Benz won’t start and the knowledge of how to hitch up Molly the mule was lost 5 generations back.There are people out there who believe they are important and vital and special and who just know that they have something of great value to contribute to the world who couldn’t change a spark plug if their lives depended on it.  There are people out there in our government and running large companies that produce only words in the virtual world who know they know better than the “common man” how life should be lived and thoughts should be thought but have no idea how to repair a leak in the walls of their grand estate or put together a ladder from wood scraps.  These sort think the world needs them to function but truth be told when the poop backs up in the toilet they are totally dependent on some guy who knows which end of a pipe wrench to grip.Henry Ford could build an auto from the ground up.  A man like Edison could rewire the house or the entire town if he wanted to.  There are still men around who can make and do things but they don’t seem to be heard from much.  Too many of our “betters” are in reality dependent children.  And like children they make a lot of noise but not much of anything of substance.
