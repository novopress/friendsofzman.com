        Failure has become to be seen as a form of success because we have mastered (well, the people at the top have) the art of re-interpretation, sift and spin. There are so many reams of data available on any cock up that the cleverer ones will work through it and find a few nuggets of success among the otherwise ruinous dirt.It’s like this: True, climate change isn’t happening in the way we predicted, but that’s only because we have found ways to work with it to lessen the impact. See, all those ugly wind-farms? Just think how bad warming would be if we hadn’t built those with your money! Not sure? Well look at all our predictions of what would have happened if we hadn’t built so many and once you have read the highlighted bits we think you’ll agree it has all been a resounding success. Of course, not a total success because hey, weather is weird and climate is unpredictable, so can we have a lot more money so we can be even more successful?

        You’ve also explained how the Supreme Court scam works.  The Supreme Court only has the influence it does because it makes the decisions on controversial issues that all of the political class support while allowing them to indulge in failure theater for their supporters.The GOP establishment in particular loves Supreme Court activism.  Instead of having to waste time giving lip service to the concerns of social conservatives, they just go along with Supreme Court penumbras finding constitutional rights to abortion and same-sex marriage.  Then when they fly out and deign to pander for the votes of us knuckle-dragging snake-handlers in the heartland they can say, “I’m opposed to abortion but the Supreme Court has spoken.  What can I do?”.  Then it’s back to D.C. to pass the latest handout for their corporate cronies.  The Dems do something similar with campaign finance reform.  Cankles will take the millions and millions that Wall Street bundles up for her PACs while complaining about money in politics.  But what can she do about it after all when the Supremes have spoken?

        I think it started in the 80’s.  The Reagan administration was pushing accountability in education.  The bureaucrats quickly figured out that if they claimed to be failing, they would get more money, money being the Fed’s chief weapon given that education is not enumerated in the Constitution and the Feds could not bring about any meaningful change except by the giving the states money with lots of mandates attached (another toxic feature of American politics that has corrupted our nation).  It was kind of fun to read the op ed pages in that era, because there was this appalling race to the bottom, with bureaucrats or their mouthpieces cherry picking statistics to “prove” that the United States was the worst in the developed world in something.Failure has become how you succeed in the bureaucracy.  Screw up and the politicians will fund you beyond your wildest dreams.  Your department is led by an incompetent?  Firing him would be killing the goose that lays golden eggs!

        No one in the CIA or FBI was punished for 9/11 failures, the CIA woman that didn’t passed information to the FBI about the terrorists before 9/11 and advocated torture to get false confessions is now a ‘General’ in the CIA, her name is Alfred Frances Bikowsky.

        I call this the accountability gap. If an engineer builds a bridge and it fails, he is ruined. If a “Scientist” makes inaccurate predictions that result in legislation and has negative impact on the citizenry, the only consequence is more grant money

            It really is an incredible thing to behold. The women in charge of the Office of Personnel Management refused to implement basic security procedures and that resulted in a massive data breech. She was asked if she would resign and she laughed it off as if it was a joke. You get fired in the private sector if you leave the office door unlocked.

                Now now….this is a “wise Latina” we are talking about—–
“Obama said her appointment (May ’13) helps “create more effective policymaking and better decision-making [for me], because it brings different perspectives to the table.”
Gosh……if it weren’t for that whole irritating and bothersome competency thingy…….
