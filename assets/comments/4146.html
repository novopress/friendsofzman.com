        I was at a bbq this summer, and a bunch of us got into a fight with the host’s friend of 30 years, a union-loving beta male public school English teacher (need I say more?)
After one of us made a joke about Picasso’s “Guernica,” he called us a bunch of fucking fascists, stormed out and hasn’t spoken to our host since.

        I have heard things like this off and on over the years. You used to hear it more often. I’m not surprised he’s old.A world run by women will not be a peaceful, progressive place. It will be a hell-hole of passive-aggressive dysfunction, where no one accepts accountability, no one lets go of anything, where nothing works, and one which will divide into very small splinter groups. Very simply, you won’t have war, because you won’t have much in the way of nations. Or even states. Or counties.And it wouldn’t last, because men will sooner or later say, knock it off and let me actually fix the problem.

        If we must have a belligerent female for President, it might as well be Lindsay Graham.

        I actually subscribed to the WSJ in the eighties and nineties. Just as I was learning what it takes to be right wing they were learning to be progressives. Sullivan’s Law, I guess.
