        The “migrant crisis” can be ended in a matter of days. Here is the instruction sheet:1. Drill holes in a few boats in the Mediterranean containing “refugees.”2. If a “migrant” is convicted of a violent crime, hang him in a very public place.3. Send rocket-propelled grenades at several politicians who make speeches and pass laws to support the invaders.Ugly? Yes. I’m sorry I feel the need to write these words. But following these instructions will avoid much more ugliness not long from now when ordinary European citizens understand that they are at war with their invaders and behave the way people at war do.

        In line with recent posts and conversations (is it just my perception but you’ve really been on a roll lately), there was a post about a year ago on a blog called slatestarcodex….I can tolerate anything except the out group….that was really interesting.http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/

        I know, via a relative, of a case in the UK where a young woman was stabbed and thrown into a river to drown. It’s hard to say which act claimed her life, but the men who did it apparently were outraged that she was going to tell their parents that one of them was the father of the baby she was expecting.A very sad business, and made sadder perhaps by the fact she was white, the men were ‘of Pakistani origin’ and it was a clear case of seemingly justified murder because this way the family’s ‘honour’ had to be preserved. It didn’t seem odd to our imported friends that though the families may have had murderous offspring, such an act wouldn’t affect their precious honour in any way. The shame lay in anyone knowing what they were up to.This is the future of Britain, and with it much of the western world. While other relatives of mine champion immigration and don’t like to talk about such matters, and prefer to concentrate on how many somali-born brain surgeons are flooding in to the UK, there are those of us who think this is the very sharp end of a considerable iceberg.

        If the Italian adopted immigrant culture with respect to justice, a mob would set upon the camp and murder its inhabitants in retribution.

        This will be a test for the EU, if they can keep together under massive 3rd World invasion or if the European countries get back their sovereignity from Brussels/Frankfurt.
Yusgolasvia was one of the best countries from the Eastern Bloc but got dismembered by NATO to save Albanian/Kosovar criminals and terrorists.

        Speaking of get used to hearing… my word of the year isdindu!
“Dindu Nuffin is a pejorative term that originated on reddit to mock and criticize black people during the numerous riots throughout 2014 and 2015.
The phrase “dindu nuffin” is derived from a bastardization of the phrase “didn’t do nothing”, a plea for innocence often used in reference to unarmed black men killed by police. One of the most famous instances of the usage of this phrase can be found in a comic. Detractors often use “dindu nuffins” to refer to sympathizers of the black community.”

        Europeans need to become far more extreme than just “irate” to deal with what’s washing up on their coasts and crossing their borders. Desperate times call for desperate measures: when will Europe cry “Uncle”?
