        Following today’s theme of normal people, doing normal things, the New York Times had a follow up hit piece yesterday on some punter for the Kansas City Chiefs (the original Associated Press piece from earlier this year failed to get him fired).This is a normal guy, playing elite sportsball, who is:1.  Catholic;2.  Married;3.  With a bunch of kids.He gave the commencement speech at “Benedictine College”, which is such a horrible school that it thinks pride is a sin and that girls can’t hang out in bikinis on the quad.Obviously this man and school are monsters.

            That’s Harrison Butker, the kicker for the Chiefs.  It’s going to be interesting to see if he soon will be out of a job, because he’s one of the best kickers in the NFL.

                God I hope so. I’ve watched all my white conservative Gen X friends go scurrying back to the NFL after a year or two of desultory grumbling about the black national anthem and the BLM antics of their favorite sportsballer. They need a blow right to the sternum.

                        I was already moving away from sportsball, but after the stunt where MLB put BLM on every mound for opening day — a quick trip to the BLM site, to read their ‘manifesto’ made it all the easier to NEVER WATCH another baseball, nor sportsball event again.
Sickening, how my fellow ‘men’ mutter things like “I need by baseball’ and such.
The pastor at my church yammers on about “the [sportsball team]” without reference to their perfidy. Also, sickening.

                            I was given some free tickets to the local sportsball team twice this year and I ended up giving them to someone else.In addition to the awful, anti-white BS emanating from their ownership, who wants to deal with confiscatory parking, food and beverage prices just to watch a bunch of overpaid jagoffs play a child’s game? I don’t.Not to mention that the owners of these teams are experts in manipulating local governments to give them taxpayer money to build their fancy monuments to assholery.It’s the only business where the owners feel entitled to shake down taxpayers, many of whom can’t or won’t go to a game, to build or upgrade their stadiums and arenas because they need more revenue.

                                Hard as it may be to do, the best thing to do in that situation is simply destroy the tickets. The less butts in seats, the better.

Bro, that’s not your pastor’s fault; that’s your own fault for sitting there and listening to his sermonizing.
Not to mention having joined a church which would have hired him to sermonize in the first place.
PRO-TIP: Home Churching FTW.

                Jeepers his speech is presses all the buttons, eapecially calling his wife a homemakerbut as “based” as his speech is you can see the drops of poison: his love for the tlm. Pius xii said the church is spotless in its discipline, doctrine and worship. So how can any of those things be less than spotless which he implies the NO is? Don’t get me wrong , the NO is not Catholic worship, but he implies that it is, it’s just not as good as the Tlm. Are you entitled to the best thing?id like to ask him, can you go to heaven attending the no? Can you become holy attending the no? If he says no, then the no doesn’t come from the church, if he says yes, then why are you moving your family to a diocese to be close to a Tlm? Just go to the no!

            I looked at his Wikipedia page, there’s more about his religious and political beliefs than there is about his football playing.
Most of the page is a checklist of everything the left hates.

            Excellent, excellent school that unlike many other Catholic schools, has not embraced the madness elsewhere in academia. Saw a meme the other day that said there were two events at Catholic colleges this time of year: Graduation season and proposal season.

        Hmmm. This Lomez fellow is, like BAP and some others who have been floated as edgy, new Right characters, jewish. Probably just a coincidence, but seems a little weird how these guys and guys like Shapiro and Lex Friedman and so many others just come out of nowhere and become influencers on the Right.Post-national, post-racial, and post-regional, you say! Well, that’s probably a coincidence, too, but it’s weird how that reminds me of the Denis Prager / Brett Weinstein style of 1990s elevation. You know, the idea that the ’90s was when the American ideal was most nearly perfected in a post-racial, post-regional, post-national kind of way.People who are very prone to imagine connections where none exist might be inclined to imagine, in their fever dreams, that Team B jews create, fund, and boost certain kinds of messaging designed to keep Whites funneled into viewpoints that still broadly align with their goals, so as to prevent Whites from landing on some viewpoints that are a little more…uh, misaligned.But I dunno, maybe rootless cosmopolitanism conservatism will be a thing.

            Contrary to so much is what is being said here in the comments, having smart Jews on your side is very much to be desired.  They are smart.
The British Empire was build with smart Jew help.  WWII was won with smart Jew help.  The left’s command of all Western culteral, political and economic heights was gained with smart Jew help.
Our side can surely benefit from smart Jew help.

                We can use their help to the extent they realize they are the help. And any “aid” they proffer that smacks of neoconnery, egalitarianism, cultural relativism, etc. will be rejected with no apology whatsoever. If that pisses them off, well, they’ll just have to mind the doorknob on their way out. In other words, we’re in charge of this thing and they get to tag along at our sufferance.

                “The British Empire was build with smart Jew help”
No, the Jews leeched off the British Empire and got their Promised Land after 1800 years in the political wilderness when Lord Balfour issued his declaration in 1917.
And when the British didn’t move fast enough to satisfy the Zionist terrorists in Irgun and Haganah, they started blowing shit up and killing Arabs and British officials.

            They sound dreadful, but there is a cultural movement afoot that is vibrant. They may be trying to attach to it in a way similar to how Matt Walsh and Charlie Kirk have sought to become remoras on dissident thought. To be fair, McIntyre is interesting but he is surrounded by poseurs.

                McIntyre expresses dissident thought in a way that won’t scare the non-terminally online. He has immense talent and I don’t fault him for not going too hard. We need people on different dissident levels to move the needle.
His stories of being a public school teacher are harrowing, and I have no doubt of his sincerity while also understanding he’s holding back his real thought.

Precisely! The DR—at least from what I tend to read here—is waay too subtractive as opposed to additive. That is a recipe for mediocrity as a movement.

                As an aspiring member of the Cosmo crowd in the past I think that people like Mcintyre are a net good. Being at the Blaze just means we reserve to switch our opinion about him at a moments notice, but so far he has stayed the course.We need a movement for people at all levels and his explainers (lol I’m VOXspeaking) about how the Marxist worm infects all institutions and parasitizes them talks to people like me. I understand that for some this way of talking may not be of interest and they will label it as useless or pretentious. I don’t know if there is any solution to this as it is not possible to discuss anything without letting your body language to express some pride about how good you feel about being right.Case in point is one of Auron’s last post about classical canons. It seems to me that this is kind of elite for some, but I was educated to appreciate our western canon that comes with a heavy intellectualized discourse. Only God knows why he blessed/cursed us with this instead of leaving us with a natural instinct that did not need any extra layer of talk with weird words as Cultural Marxism, Maoism, Blah Blah Blah as Greta says 🙂  The problem is that this mind virus has ruined XX century and the current one and so it requires some attention. Maybe the solution is just smoke pot/grill and relax, but the mind virus seems to be effective at creating a class that gets a lot of power and uses it so we need immunization.We cannot escape the intellectual, I did not make the rules. As it happens with the reality of gender and racial differences, get mad with God if you need it, but let us work in reality where the differences exist and we have to deal with them on an intellectual discourse level. How words work on humans is true wizardry, I get why some say that Marxism is a satanic cult. We need the Angels that use other spells to counter the Marxists.I have been trained to detect “cringe” and I get this post may read as arrogant and get some insults, but it is what it is.

So what.  It presents a new way of viewing a current situation.  Right or wrong, it appears to me a viewpoint I was not previously aware of.

                    Cringe is like pornography. I know it when I see it. Your comment isn’t cringe.I’m pretty explicit in my belief that all power flows from the power of a gun. At the end of the day, control of the gun is all that matters. Still, persuasion sometimes can be used to wrest control of the gun. Intellectualism is necessary to develop strains of thought that can persuade. We need salons and repositories of thought to try to try to gain advantage on that front. I knock Counter-Currents from time to time–justifiably, to be clear–but the idea behind it is solid.Finally, how can you be trained “to detect cringe?”

            For “cosmopolitan” and “trendy” read “rootless” and “flighty.”  These are the post-racial, self-described high IQ people who infest places like Sailer and now here.  Traditions are quaint or stifling, alien people are those who disagree with their ‘cool’ vibe.  They include various mestizos, subcons, and Han, who seek White women and claim to both value and be heirs to western civilization.  People like JD Vance, or those who support ramaswarthy.  The the type who go off to Europe and instantly become experts on everything American and European.When you send your pseudo-conservative kids off to ‘good schools,’ this is the group-think they will be joining.  Convinced they are smarter and better, and the first to ever discover or think about anything of note.  They are everything their boomer parents are, only moreso.Everything I deliberately jettisoned when I abandoned any and all affiliation with those “good schools” I attended, government and international work, and all the trappings of a faux cosmopolitan life.  Nothing I would choose to leave the woods for ever again.

                To 3g:History does repeat first as tragedy, then as a farce.In 1953 Stalin planned to get rid of all Soviet Jews by moving them to the thin-walled huts in Siberia. He prepared Russian population by calling Jews “rootless cosmopolitans” and Jewish doctors “murderers in white coats”.Of course Stalin died before implementing this plan on March 5, 1953, which was a 1st day of Purim.

                I take notice of your comment wrt schools and schooling.  I have been thinking about such at the end of a long life.  Indeed, you are correct—but it was not always such.  I often wonder why such as we decry did not happen to me.  My conclusion is that I slipped by this new “system” before the change.  My instruction was in a school immersed in the “Western Canon” and one that required, not simply allowed, a solid grounding in the liberal arts before discipline specialization.  All this in a State funded institution.

        These guys are the “BAP right”, after Bronze Age Pervert. They are all in their late 30s or early 40s, Nietzcschaen, hyper-individualistic, and focused on aesthetics. Peter Thiel is a big fan of them and a major funder. They also happen to be, not for nothing, Jewish academics, Zionist, and assiduously avoid discussing Jewish influence in our politics and government. This makes for an obvious conflict with another segment of the “New Right”, that being the Groypers, and the battle lines are getting drawn up as we speak.

            I wonder where the Theil conspiracy started. I see no evidence that Theil is funding these guys. He was the primary backer of Yoram Hazony, but he seems to have withdrawn from that effort. I know from people who know Theil that he has cut far back on his political funding, mostly because he has lost interest in politics.

                mostly because he has lost interestOr because he feels burned or spooked and wants to avoid new problems. Ayear or two ago, unz.com published a hit piece against “National Conservatism”, suggesting that it’s Jewish at the top and, as such, a corralling op to keep retards on the Zionism ranch. (It is.) Word is getting around, and Thiel can see where things may go politically. Any association with NC could make him a target for assassination.It’s quite possible also that some friends pointed out that he’s starting to look like the consummate, postwar, German masochist. (He’s crooked, too; has a “husband”, even.) He was himself born in the BRD, where they took kids to the camps for struggle sessions about their new original sin. Saw and heard one such session myself inside a preserved or reconstructed longhouse at Dachau. That was in Nov. 1991, shortly after reunification. (Fyi, take the S-Bahn from Munich. You can get off within walking distance iirc.)Another problem for Thiel is his Palantir connection to the MICJIMATT. He is or was chairman. So his frenemies are legion.

                The Democrats’ conspiracy theory about Thiel is that the entire non-Democrat left is his golem. He, e.g., decides who’s a guest on Red Scare. Of course he doesn’t. The idea emerged from a thing he actually does: try to make Moldbug a socialite. Thiel supports “dissident salon culture” type events and puts Yarvin in all of them, and some half-off-the-reservation leftists are invited. When Democrats do things like that it’s a nefarious conspiracy, so that’s what it looks like to them. He’s just doing a favor for the chairman of his fan club./our/ conspiracy theory about him is that he’s trying to steal our thing. Of course he is. People say he funds BAP and other gay weirdo intellectuals—on the theory that Thiel is a gay weirdo intellectual himself (no)—but I don’t think so. His last public project was a “school” to train Thiel-friendly people (corporate glowies, basically) to enter the next Trump administration, most prominently Vivek. Some of /ourguys/ shilled weirdly hard for that project, going so far as to call us racist losers for rejecting our “pajeet” better, but all that seems abandoned now. A signal went out, probably that there can be no Trump administration, and they shut up about it. Were they paid? Who cares.Weird rhetorical remnant of that round of Thiel shilling they did (and this is how you can still spot them if you missed it): They call elitism “elite theory.”

                    Sadly, no one ever asks me to be a paid shill.
Thiel through his factors funded some alt-right people back in the day, but it was small money stuff. He backed anti-immigration people, but from what I am told he grew tied of losing. That was around the time he started to drop out of politics. I do not think he is backing the alleged BAP conspiracy ring, which is not a thing that actually exists. It is a good rallying cry maybe, but I think that is it.

                        Genuinely curious about your opinion here…From our outside view, it’s IMPOSSIBLE to know but I personally think you are part of this network, possibly paid. Denying it just makes it sound worse.You have an undertone, even in this piece, of being positive to what is essentially globalist and technocratic. You’ll notice your audience here mentioning Vivek several times in relation to what you’ve written…And you can include Musk, Moldbug, and Thiel in there as some comments are… these guys are made to look conservative but it’s clear they’re probably govt assets promoting a technocratic agenda.EDIT: if you look at the other comments, it seems you’ve outed yourself to your audience by trying to ferry them along too quickly, if you are indeed part of this network.

                                Why do you, somewhat snidely, call it a “conspiracy theory” yet you admit that Thiel has funded non-mainstream characters on the right? When you do the math, all these chaps are either connected or clearly manufactured. Why use a mainstream buzzword to be dismissive about something we know happens, namely govt control of media and influencers?
Remember, we can’t know from the outside if this is happening, but when you write what another comment called a love letter–to technocracy and globalism–we must draw our own conclusions about what the goal is here.

                                    Thiel no doubt stopped at a coffee shop once. It does not follow that he is secretly funding the spike in coffee prices. As far as my use of the term conspiracy theory, you accusing me of being part of a secret cabal is pretty much the definition of aluminum foil hat nuttery. You cannot see the absurdity of it because you are obsessed at the cork board with the index cards and string mapping out the conspiracy.

                    He replaced the Kochs as the boogeyman of the day. There is always some “far-right” conspiracy going on with GOP politics in their minds. These are the same people who call Fox News far right racist White-supremacist propaganda and how Fox deftly defeats the leftists every singe time. Every time they only get 95% of what they were demanding, on cue they run out into the public square and blame Peter Thiel or the Koch bros or fox news for defeating them and how they need to fight harder. They put on their angry face and pretend the right wingers foiled them once again. It’s almost comical.

            I think they are aware of Jewish influence, but they don’t really care. They see it as a strong people doing their thing, which is of course Nietzschean. Some of them even pretend to be Jewish like Fisted by Foucault to rustle jimmies.It’s easy to believe, after reading K-Mac and then listening to TRS for years and now following Fuentes and Keith Woods that all Jews are monolithic and bent on destroying the West. Jews are quarrelsome just like their cousins the Arabs. Do you think Italians, another quarrelsome and curious people, are monolithic? Yes there is a pattern to notice, and I notice it, but in the end I blame leftists and neoliberals for our current troubles, Jew and Gentile, and I blame just the human tendency to glom onto the popular fads, which Jews do just as much as others.White people, I think, get the lion’s share of the blame, since there are so many of them, and they have a higher average IQ, and are in a position to overthink things and wreck the world. We ascended to great heights but now are descending. We will ascend again, when we get our act together. This is why the Cosmo-Right may have a chance to win where the Reaganites and wignats and civnats failed: they want a RETVRN to the days when cool diverse alpha males can break each other’s balls like those 1970s TV roasts.

                Jews are quarrelsome just like their cousins the Arabs. Do you think Italians, another quarrelsome and curious people, are monolithic?This is a false equivalency. There is atremendousdifference between Italians and Jews and really, even Arabs and Jews.A small fraction of Italians and Arabs do not control the various central banking apparatus of all Western nation states. They did not put their people into these positions in a centuries long closed system of power.So, yes, while there are cultural similarities the exponentially outsized impact of this small ingroupwithin the ingroup.Is not being considered in your analogy.Simplified– Are all Jews mustache twirling supervillains? No. And they are probably few here that actually think that. But! The ones that arereallyare and have multi-generational designs on the world and sociopathy at inconceivable levels.Just needed to correct your small logic error as you were givingwaytoo much of a pass to those bad actors that do exist.

        What turned me off about Auron MacIntyre is that he restates before addressing controversial issues that involve race or the tribe that he isn’t a racist or anti semite. I can see how that keeps him at the blaze and able to monetize his online work but I am sick of people buying into the tribe’s mandated value system for us.
I notice that the leftist protestors for Palestinians don’t always preface their condemnstions with an announcement that they are not anti Semites. We need to be brave enough to at least do that too.

            As best as I can tell, the Cosmo Right is just a cooler version of Steve Sailer. They’re against the anti-white pogrom because they believe in a utopian colorblind civic nationalism that will never exist, not because they are pro-white. They also believe that whites joining the identity politics game is WORST THING EVER. They also tread extremely lightly around the role of Jews in this whole affair.
I doubt that most of intentional gatekeepers, but they still send whites down a pointless path.

                While also pulling some oblivious Whites up to their level, to be pulled the rest of the way by people like us.  Any sending of people in the right general direction is a good thing, and instead of trying to uselessly counter-signal it, we need to take advantage of the opportunities it represents.  I saw way too much of that kind of crap back in the alt-right, with people spending almost all their time screeching at adjacent people (who make a living at it and so aren’t going to move) rather than going after their audience to move them, the people that matter, towards us.

                That’s how I see it, with people like Auron.  It’s like “no homo” is something you say after you say something really homo, or “I’m not a racist but” right before you say something really racist.

        The Tradwife movement is a novel reaction to modern societal dysfunction that deserves some attention, and it is being driven more by desperation than happenstance. Three generations of women have now grown up under the influence of feminism, and that disaster is now manifest as a crisis of mating incompatibility. No normal male wants anything to do with these woman as a mating partner, so they either get ignored or treated as disposable sex toys. In response, the pendulum is now swinging radically back toward a role model in which possessing traditional loyalty and family raising skills are the only route to marriage. The same thing needs to happen in politics. The actors and poseurs in the political arena are the equivalent of feminists and should be shunned by all normal citizens.

        The Fashionable Right? I have wondered recently if there is some point where the Left, in culture and politics, suddenly discovers it is old, played out, and unfashionable, since it has had a stranglehold on presenting itself as modern, dynamic, and what all the Cool Kids are into since the 1920s, and has owned everything since the 1990s. There has to be a point where the poles shift and Leftism becomes stodgy, old, and preoccupied with conserving the world they created in the 20th century-they are the conservatives now.

            Spot on. The shift seems to have happened already. There is a gray, stale, repellent Soviet dullness attached to the Western Left now. Very little art or original thought is associated with the contemporary Left. There also is a vibrant Thirties fascist, for want of a better word, hipness and current running through the Right. Think Mussolini/Pound rather the National Socialism in this regard. Some aspects of Trumpism fit into this milieu. The reactionaries are the conservatives, per usual, along with the Left now.The group Z has described here sounds absolutely dreadful, to be clear, and may be an attempt to attach to the ascendant zeitgeist. What these likely poseurs seek to tap is quite real, though, and different from the dissident right in that it is not really political but cultural.

            The right has long way to go to gain the artistic high ground. The Daily Wire is one of the biggest financial behemoths that is supposedly right-wing, but for some reason is trying to mimic stale artifacts like Family Guy.
All the good dissident art is still underground and on a shoestring budget.

                    But the Left has made beauty passe’ if not reprehensible. The trap we in the Right are in is that we’re playing a game of pool according to the rules of pool, but outside of that little pool table a cataclysmic earthquake has occurred that has rendered pool anachronistic and irrelevant. Our objective must be to create a macrosphere in which the microsphere of pool once again finds hospitable ground.

                        Beauty is timeless and its demand never goes away. While I’m more in the homo economicus camp as far as cultural and political transformation, those who posit that the dreariness of late Soviet architecture prefigured that system’s collapse have a point, right? Hunger is the last straw, of course, but no beauty left to preserve removes any hesitancy to flip over the table or to preserve what went earlier. I suspect a GAE economic collapse will be accompanied by a rater Pol Pot-like attitude toward the previous system.

                            Not sure Soviet architectural dreariness is a thing.  I grew up in NYC for first part of life and remember the “projects” that surrounded me.  Really not that much different IMO.  What of course is different is that the upper classes here still had private residential homes being built for them.  The Soviets had none of that middle class nonsense.

                                    Jack:  I think I disagree.  There is minimal difference between  1965-1985 concrete boxes and ‘celebrated’ brutalist architecture, whether designed and built by leftists in the US or the former Soviet Union,  I will grant that US elevators and plumbing tend to be more reliable.
I suppose I’m just getting old, but I no longer consider hallways full of doors, with people living on top of one another, as fit for a civilized people – no matter the wallpaper or carpet.

                                        As to your last point, absolutely agree. Human civilization devolved into urban insect colonies. And if that weren’t bad enough, alien drones entered and cannibalized even that low state of humanity.
I will defer to you on Russia. But I saw the dismal public apartments in Romania a very short time after Ceausescu met his maker. They were worse than even the South Side Chicago loop kill zones.

                            Yes, beauty is timeless. That said, we find ourselves in a milieu of extreme derangement in which the insane control every lever of a unitary propaganda apparatus. In such an environment, it is almost impossible for beauty’s green shoots to fully germinate and spread. And when they do, along comes the Left with its Treflan and its backhoes.
Beauty, in concrete form, cannot exist in this environment. It can only exist as an ideal. But if and when we gain possession of tracts of fertile loam, the ideal will reassume concrete form and beauty will again blossom.

            Once Leftists commit to conserving anything then they will go out of business. I mean, what is a good Leftist to do once he becomes satisfied with the status quo? No, their modus operandi and animating spirit is to constantly destroy whatever stands before their eyes. Leftism becomes increasingly deranged over time, but it never becomes stodgy.

        Aren’t these guys just younger, cooler version of Steve Sailer (except that they’re mostly Jewish). Sure, they notice the anti-white campaign, but they oppose it not because they are “pro-white” but because they are colorblind CivNats, so racial discrimination of any kind is off limits.
There’s a simple litmus test with any of these guys: Do they favor or oppose whites joining the identity politics games and, if they oppose it, why aren’t they harping daily on Jews being the ultimate identity politics players?

                            The problem with the digital age is she can be contacted from the woods, too. The upside to the woods is the types who would debase themselves in such a way tend never to be found there. It is hard to imagine a man, and it would be a man, could be so broken that they would pay a penny a minute let alone $1,500.00 for the service.

            Yeah, maybe, eh? They sound – at best – like younger cucks if I’m hearing all this right. I wouldn’t know… I’ve committed the sin of getting old and lost touch with the younger generations.
Boomers used to wail and sob about the generation gap when I was a kid. But the gap between me and my grandparents is far less than the gap between me and the millennials.

                VDH is pretty well off and 70 years old.  He don’t need a paycheck.  When it comes to Hansen, what you see is what you get.He’s very good and spot on with a lot of things, but he is a Cuck at heart.  No matter how good he is on X or Y, when his “solution” to the invasion at the Southern border is intermarriage, you’re just a cuck…. a literal cuck at that.I’ve watched him spend an hour talking about how Mexicans are not us. How they ruined his neighborhood. How hit and runs and driving w/o insurance is a way of life. Drone on for an hour in this way and then come to the conclusion that intermarriage is what is needed and Mexicans need to be less insular.

                VDH is not dumb. He is deliberately deceiptful. I’ve seen articles where he deliberately casts Rome as a successful centuries long multi-cultural and multi-racial affair and recasts America as a historically multi-racial and multi-cultural society.That isn’t stupidity. That is willful deceipt. I think everyone in that sphere has already ceded and capitulated on America as multi-culti/racial … … It is total surrender.As someone mentioned it is also a fat paycheck and no interruption to his status where going in to Stanford and sitting in the leather seats in the fancy rooms and all of the perks won’t be taken away if he takes the heroic path that someone like Jared Taylor took. There will be no statue of VDH. If there is any memory at all, it will be filled with contempt for a lying coward.

                    Valid points.  My husband is the one interested in military history, me not so much.  So he has watched/listened to/read some VDH.  What I know of him is via others’ comments.  But you are correct –  to note different cultural patterns and deliberately choose to deny the long-term effects is deceitful.

            I’ve long ago tuned out VDH.  His foreign policy views are standard neocon boilerplate.  If I want to read someone gushing about Israel, fretting about Putin-Hitler, or agitating for war with Iran, I’ll just follow the RNC on Twitter.

        Z seems to hold these guys in fairly high regard–such a rare thing!–but if they’re post-racial and post-national they’re also post-reality, which gives them one foot in the postmodern camp. Perhaps they’re the least bad of an indifferent lot of new rightwing groups, but they’re certainly not dissidents and may not even be dissident-adjacent.

        What is needed is a movement that has many faces and flavors, but behind the scenes is loosely coordinated and/or each front understands the utility of the other and allows it to do its thing in its space without condemnation.In Britain something significant has happened. This speech calls out and uses the proper language to describe what is happening – ethnic conquest and ethnic replacement. He also calls what Britain is doing in mimicking what the American military is doing what it is – a campaign of ethnic cleansing and purging of the military. It is a speech that lacks fire but whose words pull no punches. It also criticizes Sunak sending the British military for sending ships to Israel but never once engaging the invasion in the English channel. It seems as if some in Britain are doing what they must do to save Britain. They are calmly and rationally making the case for the ruling class of Britain to fulfill its duty in priority order: protect the Anglo/Celtic people who are The British. He even calls out the injustice of Sam Melia’s imprisonment. These latter two things signify that deference to silence and avoidance of anything that goes near what makes Jewish folk upset is waning. If you claim that the 20th century was yours, that it was destined to be yours by virtue of your superior Mercurial genetics at the end of the Apollonian age, at some point you are going to have to take the heat for what has gone wrong.In any case, have a look as it is quite good:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN5A8mu5XJQ&amp;pp=ygURbmV3IGN1bHR1cmUgZm9ydW0%3DIt irks me that this sniveling cosmo Konstantin Kitchin is a part of it, but this isn’t a dinner club – it is a movement to save a civilization and homelands that span three entire continents. If this thing has a role to play we’ll have to hold our noses. However, we must be prepared to hold the line on what must be held. Ceding a multi-racial, multi-ethnic society is not an option. Any who capitulate on that must be purged. We can peacefully repatriate the hordes brought in against our will. White Papers Policy Institute is doing great work there. If we can’t, well then what must be done must be done.In any case I saw the thing about the handsome, wealthy Jewish boy Lemzo or whatever. It is very sophisticated marketing. They know they have to pivot. So they have this guy ready as a suave super model. We must have our own beautiful, high IQ people at the top of their game coming to the fore as well.The Dissident Right can take credit for giving these people the foundation for what they are doing. All of the rhetoric and talking points come from it. Our job is to better organize and find a way to start throwing punches. If the Cosmo’s are serious about the Herculean task that lies ahead and they share our vision with near overlap then in order to win forces will need to be joined.I think we need to grow up and start throwing logical punches. The next set of logical punches is to seize on the language of ethnic replacement, territorial invasion and institutional ethnic cleansing, since that is what they state it is and what it says it is by what it does, and start drawing up charges that constitute crimes at every level of the law from local to international. In those charges names must be named. We have their names and we have their receipts. Rather than being on boards complaining about Lankford, try him for treason and conspiracy to commit ethnic replacement. Go right after Mayorkas and his network of NGOs. Same with the US military where Goldfein has been colluding with Austin and Brown for many years to ethnically purge the US military.October 7 changed everything. It opened up a rift and has forced The Regime to re-calculate and realign.Calculated, measured punches thrown in the ring as the Champion are the path forward. I don’t know who any of you are, but whoever you know, start taking these ideas and running with them. Complaining is wasted energy, time and opportunity.

            The New Culture Forum and Peter Whittle are doing a lot of good work.  They should be supported.
One very practical thing that they’re doing, which a lot of people in the USA wish for, is setting up a network of local, like-minded groups of people, who want to preserve what was good about Britain and fight the current madness.

                Yes. I hate to say it, but they are organizing quickly, the people I see are measured and very intelligent, and thus they are much better than what I have seen on the American DR. They know how to speak about what is really happening in terms that communicate to the in-group but without setting off alarm bells. It is impressive viewed from afar. That speech is light years ahead of anything I have seen from our side.One advantage that they have that they are clearly leveraging is that the Anglo/Celts are the indigenous people and the majority. By The Left’s moral standard that gives them the moral high ground. It is clear the minority is the colonizer.In America, we need a disposition and posture that sounds harsh and hot headed in this moral inversion we live in and an army of ab-normies to get comfortable with it. That disposition is: ‘Yes. We did conquer this continent. We came and found a vast continent inhabited sparsely by about 800,000 stone age hunter gatherer cultures. Most of them died on contact. The rest sold us land, engaged in treaties and resisted joining our civilization. In the end, we did conquer this. There is no going back. It is ours and has been for 600 years. We have the right as the sovereigns of this continent to defend it and preserve it for us and our posterity.’If not enough of our people have the moral conviction and courage to say that we will defend our homeland and our culture and our folk at all costs, or to rally to thus of us who will say it, then we are hosed. They must be led and they will follow. I think the PF sticker of Conquered Not Stolen is correct and the right message. Do enough of our people want to assert our right to our land? If not, then all of the patriotism I saw over the last few decades was just a hollow and empty show, no different than sitting around and rooting for a sports team employing mercernaries that are strangers that hate you.We are going to get our answers in the next few months and years about how much courage and conviction people have.

                    The conquered not stolen argument is pointless and won’t do anything to attract normie, and it’s beside the point of our struggle. Which is, that when we are no longer the majority we are not going to get special minority treatment like we’ve given them. Rather the opposite. Even normie should be able to understand that.

                        I agree on you later point. I also think that scaring them with that very real and looming scenario, may lead to a welling up of WPPI repatriation schemes that may buy us more time or lead to a reversal.It is a long shot, but that fear needs to be front and center. If it can be marshalled to do mass deportation and peaceful repatriation, great. If not, well maybe we can end legal subjugation via partnerships.In either case, if ab-normie is so unhealthy, so abnormal that he feels no claim to his land and accepts that his ancestors conquering it is shameful, he is too lost, too spiritually sick to scare. In that case, we will need to resign ourselves to a protected geographic in-gathering and to build it into something that our posterity feel valuable enough to want to perpetuate.

                    That attempt to shame Americans (and all whites) with phony history which portrays our ancestors as villains is very destructive, and it has to be fought against tooth and nail.  It’s a major demoralizing tactic by the Left.The NCF seems to understand that as well.  They’ve been promoting a truer perspective on British history, against the “Britain has always been Diverse, a Nation of Immigrants, etc., etc.”  Their YouTube channel has a lot of good stuff.And Americans shouldn’t have any shame about the settling and the founding.  They should be proud of it, like Americans used to be.Asyou said, those colonists conquered, and, along with that, many tried to settle in a peaceful way with the Indians, in a vast, underpopulated continent.  As many here will know, many of the Indians were just as violent and often more so with each other and with the whites, and were champions at inficting torture.  This needs to be taught again, along with how all races practiced slavery, while it was the whites who outlawed it.

        Rather tangential, but what seems to be missing for redemption is Beauty. The cosmopolite New Right may have a hipster appeal, but they do not offer a real solution, for they are dull products of the Beast. Even these more colorful analysts remind me of the unvarying gray mass of Pynchon; they are as drab as the cities that produce them. Essentially, they lack the liberal education that used to be afforded to even the most technical of political analysts.Look at the harpies on the left. They get away with normalizing horrible ideas because our society lacks the contrast. How could someone be anti-child when they read something like William Blakes “The Ecchoing Green” and understand, nay, feel it.Do not conflate my call for liberal education with the state of the liberal arts. Most liberal arts are meant to now debase. Hell – just look at the new Romeo and Juliet casting. They take something beautiful and smear it to hell.When you read the great works and look at the great masterpieces, you realize what has really been lost. Then, you want to recover it.Further, I don’t mean become a wimp and talk about your feelings. Being a man, working out, protecting your daughters and raising your sons, leading your family, building a tribe, are all essential. But if you do not have shining, guiding principles in the form of Beauty, you have nothing to steward your family towards.Take the Anglo-Saxons, certainly not an effeminate culture. Their works are incredible. Beowulf alone is one of the greatest elegies ever written (in the archaic use of the word), and when the riders mourn Beowulf, we mourn the common fate of man on Earth.Don’t become a sissy. But don’t also become some dry, ugly creature whose only commentary is reactionary and urban.I just re-read Blake today. That taught me the value of conservation far better than any blogger du jour.No jab at our host. I have been here for years. And Z has stated many times how he appreciated the Jesuit (I think it was Jesuit) education he received as a young man.

        There is a Rod Dreher-like “Crunchy Con” vibe to these guys that makes me suspect they are controlled opposition, or at least incipient gatekeepers. That, and Early Life.

        L0m3z is part of the rising cohort of right wingers who are essentially uncancellable. He’s making a mint on his small publishing company while supporting up-and-coming dissident writers. IM1776, Passage Press, Antelope Hill, and others function as a literary counterculture in the same vein as the 1960’s Beat Generation.
Given he was a literature professor, this makes sense, as the book scene is exhaustingly compromised and turgid. A guy like that can’t survive in such an environment and has to break out on his own.

        The Lomez guy getting doxxed says two things.The CIA etc are scared of him. No way that reporter, who seems both stupid and lazy, found things out on his own. It was handed to him by the CIA or FBI. Which suggests even this guy Lomez is some one they see as a threat.“The Message” (insert Critical Drinker echo) is repulsive and creates dissidence where otherwise there  would be none — see this guy Lomez who I have literally never heard of otherwise.The ultra gay, ultra black Dr. Who by destroying childhood memories has probably created more dissidents than a zillion speeches or organization efforts. Every day, a dude who “should” belong to “them” — a certain religion, athlete, good looking, married, successful (but only too a point) becomes a dissident.This is because the fundamentals favor creating dissidents. The reason this guy is a dissident is because his natural ambitions have been frustrated. With greater talent and drive he should be a big shot at a big college and instead was a minor lecturer at UCI, the least of the University of California campuses. And he was only going to move down from there as the great wave of anti-White washes over everyone and everything, even a dude with connections to certain people. So he created his own publishing company and his own mini-empire.Regimes that are successful and rely on anything other than brute force by mercenaries channel ambition, particularly of those most talented, towards the regime. An example of this is the Gurhka Mercenaries, the Chechens in Russia, and the Ike/Kennedy driven Space Race which employed millions of ambitious young White guys.The future of Lizzo twerking over the unconscious body of a White dude knocked out in the Polar Bear Hunting game, forever, is not one that does anything but: create dissidents like a factory, lose any loyalty to those remaining of the “wrong” skin color and sex.

        The Zman has been dropping lots of white pills recently. If he keeps it up we’ll be seeing pictures of his cats on gab. The fact that dissident ideas and perspectives are gaining traction and influencing these (and increasingly more) White men is good news.I’m a manager, and often bridge the gap between bourgeois gents like those described above and the hard-nosed, practical men who get the work done. Watching these guys from different backgrounds openly discuss and often come into alignment on even simple issues like January 6th, crime, drugs, or our intelligence agencies run amok – to actually dipping into necessary topics like race realism and freedom of association is encouraging.As for the Zoomer vs. Millennial outlook, I believe iron sharpens iron. Let them have it out and debate. Lomez, Fuentes, whatever. May the best ideas be tested, refined and perfected to help our people win.

        OT, but why do colleges exist anymore?  This Danny Santulli story out of Missouri is beyond sickening; beyond the worst nightmare of any stupid 18 year old trying to fit or any parent.
Why the FUCK do stupid 18 year olds bundle off to live in dorms for bullshit classes and parties all while going into debt or making their parents part with hundreds of thousands of dollars?  The opportunity cost is TREMENDOUS.
After high-school, undergraduate studies should be eliminated.  It should be straight to professional training.  No more dorms, no more dumb ass profs, NO MORE!

                Dumb kid is suffering a fate far worse than death.   Most horrendous personal story I’ve seen maybe ever.  This is where euthanasia would be needed, IMO.   The damage is permanent.

            Kinda challenging to learn electrical and computer engineering as an apprentice or on your own. Took me eight years with a terminal degree. I played an intercollegiate sport and am a Life Loyal Sigma Chi inter alia. Was the lifelong alcoholism worth the affiliation and the opportunities opened? Monetarily, yes, and health-wise, a firm no. Danny Santulli is the price the frat community is willing to pay despite decades, and the 1960’s, of unsuccessful attempts to curtail Greek life. Young men will do stupid things. Like join the army and dismemberment as a modern-day janissary. Or work a mindless job in a warehouse.

        The last thing the right needs leading it, is men who follow hipster trends.The guy I’m most familiar with in that space is Auron Macintyre. He works for the Blaze.  What else do you really need to know about him?  While I don’t view them as an enemy, they will disavow most of us.  They’re allowed on youtube, stripe, patreon etc.  At best they are the far right of the progressives.  Neocons without the warmongering.

        ‘Cosmopolitan’ is a nice way of saying ‘consumer’ or ‘tourist’. It’s also the spirit of modernity, which is on the outs. I wouldn’t put much faith in this thing for the long run. I’d guess it’s transitional.
Boomers went from hippie mystics to yuppie Evangelicals. Maybe Millennials are undergoing their own transformation. Idk, but it seems possible.

            To me it looks like national suicides led by the thoughtless and the very thoughtful of my nations. The process has been underway for many centuries, more than can be counted on one hand. It often appears that there is no escape. The duly thoughtful of the nations are sneered at contemptuously by the other two—thoughtless and very thoughtful—who are thoroughly entangled like fish in the nets of crafty fishermen.Egoism and devotion to indulgence in desireable sense objects are elements of dead end culture. Perhaps there is some wisened bhikkhu (bhikṣu) in your area who can tell more you about this aspect of our existence.Fyi, feel free to write your comments in your favorite language and to post that followed by a machine translation.

                        aescylus was a few years ago. Livy is next. Someday I’m gonna go back and re read everything. The Aenied was much more meaningful this time around with all the background I did the past few years. The plays seemed to go by really fast. I think I liked Sophocles the best . Aeschylus seemed more artsy. Sophocles was a little bit easier to understand.
tacitus was the most difficult. I barely made it through annals. Along with Livy I’m listening to machievellis discourses on Livy which is really interesting but difficult.

        It’s a pretty big stretch to call these people any kind of “Right.” They are more like the Vitalist Gay Left, the J.C. Leyendecker Left. The echoes of Weimar and its incipient National Socialism are very audible. It is no surprise whatsoever that this light-footed “Lomez” dude is publishing Sailer, since Sailer has always been a fake-and-gay vitalist hipster creep, himself.I, for one, want nothing to do with these people. The real and effective traditional politics of any age is never to be found among the hipsters. Today, it is hardly to be found anywhere. There are certain traces of it in non-mainstream economists such as Richard Wolff. Even though he considers himself a Marxist, he actually has a much more nuanced view which can serve as the starting point for an equitable economic arrangement for the post-industrial superpower in decline. It is a still, small voice in a great deal of noise.

            I am glad your retarded bullshit gets increasingly little engagement on this website unlike on unz. The correct thing to do any time you open your brain damaged mouth is to just ignore and keep scrolling, and I’m seeing that’s what people are doing.
