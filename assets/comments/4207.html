        What a silly, wacky waste of resources and a shocking smashing of morale. Americans have their stupid tipping system to pay for their waitresses, the UK has its silly TV tax to pay for their propaganda. All the women who are being prosecuted for this silliness live in rental homes. The BBC tax should be included in the rent, or better still – done away with. In Australia, the ABC is funded by Federal Income Tax and is just as disgracefully lefty biased as the BBC. In Japan, NHK collectors knock on your doors twice a years requesting “donations” in not so subtle ways. My tip – do away with your TV.

        Nobody but the poor souls mentioned in your post bother to pay as most people know the BBC people have no powers to enforce the law unless you volunteer the information.

        Good stuff, Zman. The BBC licence scam was dreamed up in the early 1920s when people began to listen to the radio, and there was always lot of fear then about radio communications by spies and ‘Johnny Foreigner’ so it made sense for a licence to be needed to receive signals. TV came a dozen years later. Oddly, in the early days everyone appearing on British TV wore dinner jackets/tuxedos or evening gowns.It also made sense as people needed all sorts of licences anyway, such as a dog licence (and giving rise to the joke that one’s marriage licence had expired so should I bother get another one?)Back then radio was so looked down upon that some newspapers either refused to publish a listing of radio programs (which was anything but 24 hours a day) or relegated the listing to a minor back page of the paper. But what is interesting about the pursuit of the population by the BBC for its licence fee that they track even the sale of televisions in shops. If you buy a new TV you are given a ‘reminder’ of the dire consequences of not registering for a licence. Merely not watching BBC is not enough, especially as it is hard to prove, and worse the Beeb employs a private company to stalk members of the public over payment. Being a commercial enterprise dependent on commission, they are very keen to make sure everyone pays up.The next argument will of course be over the internet. Al-Beeb has on the back of their huge income made a great investment in internet-delivery of their programs. Thus I can watch the highlights of my not-so-successful football team a week later if I can bear it, thanks to it being on tinterwebz. It follows then that they will want some sort of levy on ISPs for a share of the money.
