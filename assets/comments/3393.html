        “I’ve become very disappointed in Rand Paul”I think most “normal” people will have the same reaction to all libertarian politicians and pundits.  About 90% of what Libertarians believe in makes sense and is essentially a traditional conservative point of view.  It’s that last 10% that is “crazy”.  But for whatever reason no one ever seems to rise to the top of the pool of Libertarians without a strong belief in that crazy 10% of their beliefs intact.  In general I like Libertarians until they have talked for more then ten minutes or so.  They are kind of like that shirt sleeve relative who is a nice guy but hates blacks or “queers” or something and isn’t smart enough to hide it.

        I’ve become very disappointed in Rand Paul. It seems he is trying to appeal to a wider swath of society so as to be more electable. While I find Libertarianism an interesting idea or philosophy, I’m not totally on board with their viewpoint as I think they often forget that human nature is what it is and often want to appeal to our Better Nature, sans government. Most of the rest of us live in the real world, where things tend to be less esoteric. I think you’re right about Rand; he has no clue how the Other Half lives.

        “Sealing the records would keep them out of FBI background checks requested by employers and likely make it easier for those former offenders to secure a job.”Silly idea. Companies would be very reluctant to hire anyone who looked likely to have a prison record unless they paid a private investigator to do the research first. That pushes up costs of business, tends not to hire any more crims.The other day I was in a store when guy came in with a crudely done tattoo of a tear drop on his cheek. I didn’t make eye contact, as the guy was clearly wearing the approved prison mark that he had done time for murder. No matter how many rules you put in place, if they decorate their face with a trademark then you can guarantee they won’t get a job easily.Of course then you have quote imposed to make businesses hire so many crims, or else. In fact, making normal business into criminals and make them do time ought to help enormously.

            There’s really no way to “seal” a criminal record. You can make it more difficult to obtain, but even that is not going to be much of an obstacle. That’s probably why libertarians are attracted to the idea.
