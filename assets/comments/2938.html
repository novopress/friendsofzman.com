        “The whole point of the EU is to keep the peace in Europe.”Not entirely. I believe the EU sees peace as a fringe benefit, not a reason. I have no doubt another conflict where one country charges through Belgium and ends up fighting in northern France would be every bit as destructive as what happened on the previous two occasions. But Germany runs the EU and they, for now, may be less aggressive than before so it falls to France to plug  peace, but they aren’t sat in Berlin.I think the reason that the EU exists is simply to make sure a class of managers, swelled by socialist ideals of one currency and no border restrictions (a subject somewhat under review as Italy sags under the weight of thousands of immigrants from Africa and making France close its borders) get to run things for their own benefit.Europe is a mass of small countries, but there is an enormous shared heritage in that many languages borrow from each other for example, intermarry to a degree and such things as architectural styles tend to be similar. There are other ‘commonalities’ too. On the other hand European countries still prefer self-determination. I know most of the UK wants it though we have political parties in charge who see profit (for themselves, probably) in keeping us in the whole mess.So the EU is always going to have a difficulty because tolerating is not the same as integrating. We might do better to agree to be different and keep our borders and respective identities, and then build trade from there on out.All we have to do is make sure Belgium isn’t a route to a battlefield again.

        What makes Europe so interesting–and important–is that there are so many different countries, separated by language and manners, but with the same problem to address. It cannot be foreseen where or how the first spark will ignite the first real resistance, but it seems possible that an avalanche would follow. Tocqueville as a guide–Time does not arrest its course for nations any more than for men…When we think things are stationary, it is because we fail to see their movements. The evil which one suffers patiently as inevitable seems insupportable as soon as one conceives the idea of escape from it.

        You are being far too kind to the Greeks.  They committed fraud on a massive scale to join the EU.
Of course, no con succeeds without the greed of the mark.

        John Fogerty had it right.  There is a Bad Moon Rising.
The traditional male attributes and attitudes are scorned in the West, other than in the context of gang life.  Much of the extreme depth of our cultural peril comes from that.
