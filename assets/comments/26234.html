        this is a question for everyone here, not just Zman.in a darwinian sense, do normies deserve to die?i say ‚Äòyes‚Äô, that normies are a very real impediment to the emergence of a new system.why#1?  they are so mentally welded to the old system.why#2? they do not have the excuse of muds; i.e. IQ too low to figure out what is going on.  IMO they are wilfully blind.why#3? they are unfit in the biological sense, and cannot even control their own eating.why#4? they are amoral.  if you do not know the difference between ‚Äúamoral‚Äù and ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù please look both words up in a dictionary.I am not advocating their being killed, just that it is both necessary and deserved.  and inevitable due to their inherent self-destructive nature.in short, i believe these people are fundamentally defective and inferior.

            I think they‚Äôre livestock. Hopefully that‚Äôs unfair, wicked, or whatever, of me. Hopefully I‚Äôm not normie myself.
Like domesticated animals that escape, some would survive and ‚Äòre-wild‚Äô. I imagine most would perish.
Rather not let nature take its course, but it‚Äôs to a point where everybody is going down with the ship if there aren‚Äôt major changes. Let the dead bury the dead if thats what it takes.

            Karl, the world is an overpopulated place.  You as an individual cannot stand up to a mob.  They will easily crush you.When I realized that the fundamental truth of the world is tribalism then I began to look at the white normies differently.At first, I reached out to the white normies in self-interest because if the non-white hordes come for me then the white normies are my only possible protection.Later, I began to love them as my extended family.  Psychologically and spiritually, we long to be part of a tribe.Of course, they are mostly idiots right now but I believe that they will eventually grasp the fundamental truth of this world.

            I think what you‚Äôre trying to say is let nature take its course, and stop propping up brings that can‚Äôt take care of themselves.
I don‚Äôt think it will be a choice anyone has to take, if things continue on the path they are on. Nature will sort things out without anyone making an act in furtherance.

            Normies are annoying but essential . People willing to knuckle under to authority make agriculture, cities and technology possible.Otherwise   the most complex society you can have is a tribe, usually a nomadic one like the Huns or something.if we wanted to build a semi stable social matrix ,what you‚Äôd need to do is remove everyone on the psychopath/sociopath/no morality spectrum from society making sure that people who can‚Äôt integrate are not around.The societies innovation level would be much slower compared to others as some austistic types would need to go and stupidity would still happen but the worst pathologies would be avoided.

        Regarding higher interest rates ‚Äúfixing‚Äù inflation, no, that simply doesn‚Äôt happen. Higher interest rates don‚Äôt fix inflation. Inflation is not caused by low interest rates, it‚Äôs caused by an increase in the money supply. That‚Äôs all. High interest rates just transfer the inflated money into the pockets of people who lend money.Hmmm. Who would that be? I dunno. The Shift-9 and Shift-0 keys on my keyboard seem to be broken.The only way to reduce inflation is to reduce the money supply, and the main large-scale way to reduce the money supply is to cancel bad debt. Of course, that *hurts* the above people who lend money and who are not you and me.

                The way I understand it, lending at interest (usury!) creates money, high interest rates discourage borrowing, encourage saving. You‚Äôre both partially right, I‚Äôd guess. More knowledgeable people can correct me.

                    Usury brings forward gains from future productivity in the form of debt and new money. Those future gains are eventually neutralized by inflation and bankruptcy.  Ward off inflation and bankruptcy with magic tricks, like our financial system has managed to do for at least 15 years, and it seems to me all productivity grinds to a halt. See the labor market and birth rates. That‚Äôs this nobody‚Äôs opinion anyhow üôÇ

        Cruz and Kazahkstan. With Cruz it is possible, though he has been more savvy than that, of playing the old double game like McCain. Build the damn fence, then open borders when elected. But he‚Äôs not elected. Either he lives entirely in the bubble and has no idea of what his actual and potential voters think ‚Ä¶ or the people who really run the Senate told him that after 2022 let alone 2024 there will be mass arrests of Republicans for ‚Äúinsurgency‚Äù to deal with the Red Wave as dissatisfaction with Biden grows like a tidal wave. [Schumer does not run the Senate, its probably someone younger and with more future running things.]Kazahstan ought to be a warning flag for the regime instead of a victory lap. True they created a problem for Putin to forestall action in Ukraine, but they were pushing on an open door: Kazakhs all had CARS running on natural gas, more prosperity, and an aging behind the scenes oligarch (the former dictator who ‚Äúresigned‚Äù) ended subsidies meaning people could not run their cars any more. Of course they rioted. More importantly elderly leaders inspire no loyalty and cannot because they have no future patronage to offer. Its different for AOC (the press really loves her) or Rashida Tlaib or Pramilla Jayapal or Ilhan Omar. They are young, and offer to various women of color lots and lots of patronage and opportunities. The elderly trio of Biden, Schumer, and Pelosi offer no opportunities. The same goes for Trump too. Just too old ‚Äî they won‚Äôt be around enough to jump start a career.The people running things are either out the door or young, female, non-White with stupid ideas, even more stupid and limited staffers, who cannot connect or create loyalty to ultimately White men who form the backbone of the technical workforce, the military tip of the spear, and law enforcement. The people who keep the power running, stores stocked, deter enemies, and arrest regime enemies. Imagine Pramilla Jayapal lecturing White dudes about how awful they are. And if the Regime can stir up trouble with an open door in Kazahkstan, so too can Putin here at home. With all sorts of ways to stir up trouble including putting stupid action plans into the heads of young, non-White, female staffers of people like Prayapal or Omar or AOC.

            First, the color revolution in Kazakhstan is a CIA cover OP (with lots of help from MI6) being run as a ploy to divert Russian assets from the border with Ukraine. It‚Äôs not a spontaneous uprising per se, but nonetheless has some valuable lessons to be learned.The key takeaway is that when lots of people fill the streets in mass protest, it fully engages and ties up the local LEOs and military in crowd control and key-facility security tasks. This is what the fog of chaos looks like. It is quite easy now to disappear into a crowd or move about elsewhere unfettered. And all the rats tend to hide in their bunkers because of the  unrest and instability. The smart ones will begin to flee and drag a large (and noticable) security entourage around with them.Getting yourself shot at the front of street mob is not an effective protest. There are better options. Smarter, not harder.

        Too good, I have add this in about Insurrection Day:‚Äú‚Ä¶add the antifa types around the corner of the Capitol, breaking windows and pushing cops for the cameras.Meanwhile, the Trumpers on the front steps knew nothing about that, and were more than happy to enter the building when invited.Then Pelosi and McConnell announced they were under attack and stopped the proceedings.I had friends watching on C-Span. That was the first time that the evidence had been presented on live TV, nationwide.Just as one Congressman was reading the evidence the feed was cut.And when they all came back the dissenters had been silenced and were properly chastened.It was an operation and it went off flawlessly.‚Äù‚Äì Paula DMy reply:It was an operation to cut off presentation of the evidence of the Steal.Proof? My favorite picture:The one showing Congressionals cowering behind the front row seats?The larger picture shows the rows behind them. Congressmen in the seats above, sprawled out, bored, surfing their cell phones, or gazing down in perplexed contempt at the idiots cowering behind the front row seats.

        ‚ÄúLike communism, liberal democracy has evolved into a revolutionary mindset without a defined end. It is just a process that goes on until something magical happens and we reach utopia.‚ÄùLiberal democracy IS communism. Not for nothing did communist nations refer to themselves as ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs DEMOCRATIC Republics.‚ÄùLike communism, liberal democracy will reach Utopia when everyone is equal: the gays, transgenders, pansexuals, blacks, queers, Latin/a/o/xes, disabled, etc., etc. and when the borders are open, the internal combustion engine has been abolished, and everyone has Universal Basic Income.Just as communists had to invent the threat of the kulaks and ‚ÄúTrotskyite counterrevolutionaries‚Äù and ‚Äúcapitalist pigs‚Äù to stay in control, the Powers That Be need to gin up imaginary Nazis, terrorists and ‚Äúinsurrectionists.‚Äù When there aren‚Äôt any, or aren‚Äôt enough competent ones, they FBI can always entrap a few low-IQ morons and set them up as defendants in show trials ‚Äî also like the communists.When public monuments or historical figures contradict the Official Narrative, they can be demolished or airbrushed out of the history books like Comrade Yehzov.The ‚Äúpermanent revolution‚Äù is the war on private property, the war on marriage and heterosexual monogamy, the war on fossil fuels and autos, and the war on ‚Äúracism.‚Äù It has been ongoing since the Sixties. Charlottesville and 1/6 are just propaganda events used to buttress this narrative just like the Doctors‚Äô Plot.Not for nothing did the U.S. ally itself with the communist Soviet Union of Josef Stalin during World War II, and fought together to crush an ethnic nationalist who won election in a parliamentary democracy.

            I admit that I‚Äôm a bit of semantic crank on this issue, but not everything we dislike is communism.  Communism has a fixed meaning and it is that the government owns the means of production.
I think ‚Äúanti-white anarcho-tyranny‚Äù is a better description.
When we call our current situation ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù instead of ‚Äúanti-white,‚Äù we blunt the force of our criticism and hide the truth.  This comment applies doubly so to ‚Äúcultural marxism.‚Äù
Sure, calling our current situation ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù you may get the Boomers riled up but they think you‚Äôre talking about lowering their taxes and protecting their stocks.

        Here is the question I struggle with‚Ä¶ what do we call this nonsense? I refuse to refer to it as ‚ÄúThe Insurrection‚Äù because that‚Äôs both Fake and Gay.I‚Äôve been using the Zman‚Äôs preferred nomenclature of BLM/AntiRacism/CRT efforts as ‚Äúanti-White‚Äù and that works great. What is the term that we can use to refer to this event without using the Enemy‚Äôs language..?

            Honestly, it was an insurrection.  The people who went to the Capitol were expecting to watch their god deliver justice.
However, they weren‚Äôt a threat.  Like Christians awaiting the Rapture, they expected to passively cheer on their God as He did all the work.  It was an insurrection but an insurrection where everyone brought a Ouija board instead of weapons.
As much as I sympathize with the insurrectionists, it was basically an IQ test and everyone who attended failed the test badly.  They believed Trump.

                    Well, as a skeptic: I‚Äôve never heard anyone defend that the Nazis did not act barbarically against civilans (Jews etc., although for some mysterious reason, the Jews get all the attention.)Deporting millions of civilians, including citizens of one‚Äôs own nation, into detention camps is barbaric enough. But even the USA did it, albeit in much lower numbers. And we treated our internees rather better than the Nazis or Soviets did. Even though concentration camps were an abrogation of human rights, it still stops short of deliberate extermination.It is upon that, as I understand it, that most of the claimed Holocaust narrative hangs. I am agnostic on this historical point, having not studied it at all.However, as a counter-argument, allow me to give a single data point: Anne Frank, who could be called the poster child of the mistreatment of the Jews. Yes, she died in a prison camp of a disease, in early 1945. But here are a couple points you‚Äôll never hear the Holocaust advocates make:1. Apparently the evil Nazis cared enough to feed these poor souls. Not much, it‚Äôs true, but enough to keep them barely alive. This, while they were losing the war and everything, including food, was in very short supply.2. Putting a hated Jew into a hospital and providing care, however rudimentary and limited, same argument.Both of these facts seem to go hugely against a narrative that would have the Nazis exterminating the unwanted as expeditiously as possible. From the history (photos) I‚Äôve seen, most of the dead at the camps were victims of neglect, starvation, disease. This is cruelty, to be sure, but apparently the Nazis failed to off the prisoners sooner. Very curious, for a culture that was known for its efficiency and ruthlessness.

                        You need to be camp specific, but in the main most camps  were used as holding for enslaved workers (the old, young, sick, weak being killed immediately).  The workers had a planned life expectancy.  There was always conflict between the die hard NAZI Jew haters and the civil industrial production planners who needed labor and could use any and all‚Äîregardless of race.There was also some attempt toward the waning days of the war to bargain prisoners for supplies.  And even as late as end of 1944, high numbers of new prisoners fell into NAZI hands, ex.  Hungary turned Facist and began to turn over hundreds of thousands of its citizens and refugees.There was a reason that the camps had the slogan ‚ÄúArbeit Macht Frei‚Äù on the entry gates.

                        Ben, Hitler and the National Socialists wanted a national divorce from the chosen.  I hope that you can sympathize with the sentiment of not wanting to live with people so fundamentally different from you.Up until the war, the Nazis were helping the chosen move out of Germany.  After the war started, things got deadly serious, just like they did here, when we put the Japanese and some Italians and Germans in camps.No concentration camps in the USA had swimming pools and symphonies like Auschwitz did.  Objectively, the camps run by the Germans were nicer.The only reason that the German camps look bad is that Germany was losing a total world war.  Had we been losing, our camps would have looked just as bad.

        Try as I may, I simply cannot convince myself that these people are just stupid or crazy and not self-consciously lying.  Z‚Äôs example of the friends of the guy who wrote to Z and said, ‚Äúno, he‚Äôs not crazy, he just has no moral compass,‚Äù that is a perfect example. He‚Äôs not delusional, he‚Äôs a pen for hire and will write either whatever he is told to write, or, more likely, whatever he thinks they want to hear.A big reason, I think, for all the articles about the ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù is that they alone will survive time.  When babies born today have their own children in high school, they will learn about the great 2021 insurrection and there will be no other surviving record and nobody to argue with what is in that written record.  This is exactly what happens today.If you read about the ‚Äúcivil rights movement‚Äù of the 60s, the only surviving record is what the press wrote about it, brave groups of students and Jews going to the South and being beaten in lunch counters for no reason whatsoever. They just ‚Äúnon-violently‚Äù sat there and let the racist rednecks beat them 1/2 to death because they were evil at heart. Black people just trying to go school had dogs and fire hoses turned on them.  The mean, evil white people just tortured them for their own sadistic pleasure.The very preposterous nature of what they propose is their best defense. ‚ÄúThey really do believe this‚Äù is the natural reaction to such bold faced lies. We have a hard time accepting they could tell such obvious lies and so, deep down, they must believe it.

            Yes.  It will go into history books as inflated as the victors are able to inflate it. (but less than the millions of magic Six.) It will be taught  in classrooms: holocaust, indians, holocaust, slavery, jan6, holocaust, sodomy.

            All those historical examples you cite as ‚Äúlies‚Äù were something far worse. They were half-truths. To use your civil rights example, there really were ‚Äúmartyrs‚Äù made of many of the Liberals, innocent blacks etc. Yes, of course there is much more to the story. But the point I want to make: the Radical (the civil rights activists in the 1960s examples, or their enablers in the press) seizes upon the exceptions to the rule and enshrine them as the norm. The one partisan who was unjustly killed becomes the hero, the martyr of the cause. The thousand or million who got exactly what they deserved? They are swept under the carpet. The grain of cherry-picked truth that suits their point of view swamps the broader picture, the historical context, that might have cast all the events in an entirely different life.We see exactly the same phenomenon in other domains: the media showing the heart-wrenching human interest story of the young child dead of Covid-19 (more likely ‚Äúwith‚Äù) because his thoughtless Trumper parents would give him the experimental injections.  Even if the facts (carefully selected of course) of the incident are true, they rarely represent the statistical truths, any more than the plane crash on the news represents the real risks to air passengers.

                Anyone in the medical field, nurses especially, will have stories about the strangest occurrences involving patients and treatment outcome.  Nothing is 100% safe.  So it is quite easy for any outlier event to be found to prove/support any damn  thing you want.
As I‚Äôve said repeatedly, the average ‚ÄúJoe Normie‚Äù is too stupid to understand statistics and risk analysis.

        One of the best clips that day was watching Romney running through the capital. ‚ÄúOh no, Mitty, they are on to Pierre Delecto!‚ÄùJust for the fun of it, I tuned in to NPR for a few minutes while driving yesterday to peer in to the insurrection crap show of clown world. They were interviewing a few of the ‚Äúwomen of color‚Äù who were present that day, trembling in fear. The congresswoman they interviewed (didn‚Äôt catch her name) spoke about the fact that she fled her country and came to the US to flee just the type of situation which occurred on that horrific day of January 6. She cried and was barely able to describe the account through her tears. A male staffer had to place his foot at the bottom of the door as they cowered in fear. No one attempted to open the door at any moment. But still, Imagine how frightening that must have been!It was absurdly hilarious.Then I thought of what Ashli Babbit might have been thinking as she lay dying.The fact that someone recently wrote an article to slander and smear her is reprehensible.The Zman‚Äôs  fantastic point about their hatred of Trump supporters (not necessarily Trump) really resonates as we remember the fate of poor Ashli Babbitt.

        ‚ÄúThey seem to require an Alamo-type event to rally their minds around as they lash out at their enemies.‚ÄùAmerican culture is built around the concept of the beautiful loser. Americans have romanticized the Alamo (a heroic last stand), the Antebellum South (another last stand), the Indian (‚Ä¶), the Battle of Wake Island (a mythological ‚Äúfought to the last‚Äù battle popularized by John Wayne), etc. This often extends to foreigners as well. German soldiers were portrayed as competent badasses in American movies until the 1970s. Even today WWII in the Pacific is mostly talked about in sterile terms, maneuvers and technology, and not so much in terms of denigrating the brave Japanese personally.Romanticizing the beautiful loser allows the ruling class to live vicariously as brave warriors fighting to the last against oppression ‚Äì against a morally inferior ‚Äúother‚Äù, the defining feature of Leftism (‚Äúme good, you bad‚Äù). Last stands are the greatest test of character and bravery.  Would you have the courage to fight until the bitter end against overwhelming odds? If so, you‚Äôve proved your mettle. And that‚Äôs a powerful psychology for many, especially in the upperclass who‚Äôve mostly attained their power through nepotism and good luck rather than anything heroic or honorable.The American regime wants to fantasize they are brave warriors fighting against overwhelming odds when, in reality, they are cowards who hid under their desks from overweight, unarmed protestors. They can‚Äôt stand that thought.January 6th, Insurrection Day, will go down in history as America‚Äôs Tienanmen Square: an oppressive regime inappropriately used lethal force against righteous, unarmed protesters ‚Äî then horribly punished dissenters with their police state, jailed the opposition, and lied about what happened.Detractors miss what this day represents either because they thought the protestors were naive or because they hate Donald Trump personally. But I would argue that it doesn‚Äôt matter. It happened. And the response, both in terms of shooting Ashley Babbitt and mocking the public by giving her black shooter an award (after jailing a white cop who accidentally killed a black career criminal, George Floyd), and in terms of the regime‚Äôs preposterous, hamfisted lies on its anniversary, will prove far more significant than the protest‚Äôs initial motivation. That part will be forgotten by history. The regime‚Äôs response to this event, which was to take something quickly fading from public view, and turn it into an Alamo for the other side, will be remembered ‚Äì I suspect ‚Äì when the American Empire comes crashing down.However the regime would like to frame things, they weren‚Äôt the underdogs on January 6th. This wasn‚Äôt their Alamo. They aren‚Äôt Scarlett O‚ÄôHara. And they aren‚Äôt the Lakota at Wounded Knee.The regime didn‚Äôt have the high-ground after their crimes during the 2020 BLM Insurrection (a literal insurrection aimed at forcing out the government through violence); after their treasonous Russiagate lies; after the Pentagon‚Äôs interference during the 2020 BLM Insurrection.The lies surrounding January 6th are merely an attempt to recast events as favorable to the empire‚Äôs leaders, and they‚Äôve reached back into American popular mythos to get it done. But they‚Äôve messed up and made it a heroic last stand for the so-called bad guys. And that‚Äôs why conservatives are wrong to run away from it. Everyone loves a beautiful, and brave, loser who fought against overwhelming odds and didn‚Äôt back down.

            I appreciate your honesty.  We will win because we hew to the truth and that includes self-reflection and self-criticism.
(My niece went to college and said she was majoring in biology.  We all thought that she was set to get a decent job.  After she graduated with a degree in something like kinesiology she informed everyone that she was starting work as a greeter at a restaurant.  She said her degree did not prepare her for any job.  The family groaned.  At least it wasn‚Äôt women‚Äôs studies, I guess.)

        ‚ÄúCommunism eventually sidelined the fanatics. That is largely what happened when the Brezhnev faction deposed Khrushchev‚Ä¶. Biden is the closest analog to Brezhnev and he is a doddering old fool incapable of doing anything.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think of Khrushchev as a fanatic nor of Brezhnev as the angry and senile old man. Khrushchev rejected the fanaticism of Stalin‚Äôs regime. Andropov and his successor (I forget the name) were the Bidens of the Soviet regime, eventually resulting in its demise. Brezhnev had a nice, long run in office ‚Äî much longer than the feeble Biden will enjoy. But Harris is no Gorbachev.

            Khrushchev abandoned the paranoia of Stalin, but he was a true believer. He launched a number of programs aimed at perfecting communism. Cybernetics is the most notable. Khrushchev and his faction really believed they were on the cusp of the promised communist utopia.

                Cybernetics is control theory, in the scientific sense. If the Russkies abused that term for mind control or whatever that doesn‚Äôt make it a dirty word. Robotics is to a large extent cybernetics.

            Cherenko, if IIRC and spell correctly.
I have to thread the needle here. Z is right in that Kruschev was the final True Believer, but the analogy between Biden and Brezhnev is quite strained. If the last USSR dictator had been Andropov or Cherenko, one of those would be a closer analogy to Biden in all respects.

        Why are all these people so willing, eager even, to tarnish what little credibility they have by putting all this nonsense in writing in a very public way?  It is pretty easy to laugh off something you said with your mouth, as misspeaking or letting your mouth get ahead of your brain, or even just getting carried away and caught up in the moment. But it is very difficult to do the same with the written word,  let alone something written for publication in a newspaper.  Multiple people also had to sign off on every word of it.In the fullness of time, every one of these imbeciles are going to regret it.

                But that‚Äôs just another way of saying they believe their own BS.  It‚Äôs also easy to ‚Äúwant to believe‚Äù this about them as well. I just can‚Äôt bring myself to do it.  Now, it is certainly easier to maintain a lie when everyone around you is pretending the lie is actually the truth. That, I grant you.It‚Äôs reminds me of the fake Navy Seals.  To me it is as unbelievable to say the managerial and media classes believe their own BS as it is to believe the fake Navy Seals REALLY starts to believe he was a Navy Seal.  That‚Äôs why the fake Navy Seal reacts so hyperbolically to being called a fake. Deep down he knows he‚Äôs a liar and a fraud and that he is being exposed.  They react to the protestors in DC in the same way. They know they are evil. They know they are liars and they are deathly afraid of the wrath of the people over whom they rule.

                    Maybe deep down, but they are superficial creatures. It is like the mask stuff. They really believe they are saviors, even if they do not put on the mask themselves. AOC truly believes her directives to wear masks saves lives, even if she does not wear them. Her performance as a savior is what determines her righteousness. Outside of her speeches, she does not think much about it.The problem with your assumption is that you assume they reflect upon the words they say. I cannot look into the heart of another, but I believe so much of politics is performative that the performance is the truth in that domain. They go onto the stage, they perform their lines, and they think no more about it. I suppose you could argue that they compartmentalize, but I suppose that only applies if they were traumatized. I think they just slip into a role and perform.Does an actor feel they lied when they perform a role? I think they probably do not think much about this stuff, except when they put on the role. When they walk off the stage they leave the issue behind like a snake sloughing off its skin. No more thought is probably given until the next time the role is conjured.We see the clips 24/7, but I bet most of these people‚Äôs days are completely removed from any consideration of the news headline stuff. Chuck stood on the stage, delivered a few solemn lines, and then got into a chauffeured vehicle and probably Sandusky‚Äôd some little boys the rest of the day. No more thoughts on the matter until the next time.In short, I think we think about this stuff more than they do (to be clear ‚Äì not the media; they are obsessed).

                Cruz is a snake. Here‚Äôs a bit of history, unknown to most, but significant nonetheless: Ted Cruz placed one of his senior confidants in Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. She turned out to be an important ‚Äúresistance‚Äù leader who leaked all kinds of dirt about the man. Cruz lobbied for this woman, recommended her. Does anyone really think Ted Cruz didn‚Äôt know what she was going to do? Now pair that with his history of lying ‚Äî pretending to oppose immigration but going to the border with Glenn Beck to hand out toys to illegal border crossers ‚Äî and his efforts to sabotage Donald Trump at the republican convention. Ask yourself if his ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù comment wasn‚Äôt just a calculated insult meant to garner positive DNC media coverage for his future presidential run. Just who is this man working for?

                    After the reaming Cruz has gotten, and will be getting for some time, for his ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù bull shit, he will probably go beyond merely being a mendacious anti-Trumper, and go the full Bitch Cheney, at minimum winding up caucusing with the democrats, if not actually changing parties.That latter may depend upon his sense of whether Texas is about to tip blue, what with all the illegals, as well as the numbers of Blue Ticks fleeing the consequences of the prevailing ideologies where they came from, but then entering Texas ready to again advocate for the ideologies that led to their departure from the Blue states from whence they came.

                    The same person every politician is working for; Themselves.
For crying out loud, at this time in history, if a person actually BELIEVES that a politician has their best interest at heart, they deserve the inevitable ass reaming that will come their way.
Honest to God, how many times do they have to lie cheat, and steal, before a person wakes up?
No one is coming to save you, especially a professional grifter.
Sorry for the rant but the Ashli Babbit section in the episode put me over the edge.

            Good good point there.The best thing about these COVID lockdowns is they killed consumerism. A lot of people not just the women you mentioned have decided that the endless race for stuff and constant struggle to pay loans (you didn‚Äôt really think the parasite class would pay you a good wage, hah hah no) to buy said stuff isn‚Äôt worth it.Minimalism is getting more popular as is  buy what YOU actually  need, not what people tell you that you need and it couldn‚Äôt have come at a  better time.The PTB‚Äôs though aren‚Äôt going to like the GDP decline, population decline or any of that and are liable to go more bonkers than usual  as the edifice crumbles around them.Worse a huge chunk of that missing labor is the skilled labor from the Boomer generation. That we can‚Äôt replace and in a few years when Gen X starts pulling the plug ? Well things will get interesting as the US finds it simply can‚Äôt do a lot of things, no one wants dollars and no one is spending.

        One could argue that the Jan 6th event is a Rorschach Test for sanity in the modern era. The events of that day were recorded by hundreds of cellphone video cameras and Revolver has put together a compelling composite demonstrating quite conclusively that Stasi undercover agents planned and executed this false-flag OP with malice aforethought. It‚Äôs not clear that Ashii Babbit‚Äôs murder was pre-planned, but every other ‚Äúviolent‚Äù act was a direct result of incitement by these Stasi provocateurs. Yet, no one in Congress is even the slightest bit curious about that video and what it shows.The moral of this vignette is that the collaborators in Congress know exactly what they are doing and the insurrection is actually happening inside the Capital Building in real-time during these hearings. And never forget that Herr Wray of the Stasi was asked directly during a Congressional hearing if the Stasi was involved in Jan 6th and he refused to answer the question.This is what we‚Äôre up against. A wife-beating Stasi agent in the Whitmer kidnapping caper and Ray Epps, Stasi provocateur extraordinaire, on video inciting people to break into the Capitol on both Jan 5th and the morning of Jan 6th, and he never went to the Trump speech. Instead, he positioned himself at the break-in point all morning and coordinated the actions of his accomplices in tearing down the fences and then leading the charge. Ray will not be testifying at the inquisition this week. Why not?

                I heard somebody say they were there, that at back streets the police were beating the schmidt out of people- batons, pepper spray, flash bangs.  At least one guy was killed by a fired smoke grenade denting his head, the cops wouldn‚Äôt let an ambulance take him or other wounded.
Perhaps those videos reveal a bit too much; after all, the cell phone providers cooperated immediately.  Can they sensor streaming?

        pretty sure that jason stanley guy is a tribe member, liberal juuz consider the word nazi to mean enemy of juish interests. Anyone who opposes official public policies is a nazi, if you don‚Äôt buy into juuish scams you‚Äôre a nazi, plain &amp; simple.if there are people within the republican party who oppose mainstream liberal ideas then that must mean they are nazis, they can‚Äôt publicly call them enemy of the juuz so they call them nazis.Nazi party might be gone, but the nazi spirit is still alive, that‚Äôs what the tribe believes, a present day badwhite is a white who would have approved of hitler back in the day, opposition to liberalism is how a tribe person figures out if you‚Äôre a bad white or not.Everything that‚Äôs going on today stems from WW2, first it was the nazis who were bad, then it was the racists, then it was the nationalists, now all whites are guilty until proven otherwise.

                    I love the way Americans always leave out their role in Europe in the ‚Äô30s.
Or their anti-European policies after WW2.
The destruction of Europe and North America just seems to coincide with the rise of America. Notice how after the collapse of the USSR and the realization of America‚Äôs unipolar moment this anti-white stuff goes into hyperdrive.

                    That is not a helpful standard.
Nazi means bad in liberal speak. They can also use it against people like Dubya and then take it back. Its not that serious.

                100 percent agreed. After he got embarrassed by Trump, he realized that their was a market he could tap into. He went from mainline to a ‚Äòhardcore‚Äô type after his experience in the primaries. Give the scumbag credit, though, he did learn that the MAGA types will keep him in power. Most GOP Congressmen avoid it like the plague.

            The lesson for me there is that even the ‚Äúouter party‚Äù members of Congress do not fear the regime street enforcers (Antifa, BLM, etc.), at least not in an existential sense.

        You know, all of this January 6 stuff is really entertaining. Everywhere you read commie agitprop press it‚Äôs everywhere.I was reading about the real Brandon the other day- the NASCAR driver who got dragged into something he didn‚Äôt even do. Someone was going to sponsor his car and actually paint a ‚ÄúLBG‚Äù on it. NASCAR, or course, pooped out 10 litters of puppies and said we ain‚Äôt having that around here.The commentaries were worth a 12 pack and a fifth of 100 proof. ALL of them were wailing about evil Republicans and their insurrection, and they were telling the few dissidents how that‚Äôs the way free enterprise works, and hurray for NASCAR stiffing all of those white-supremacist crackers down there. That‚Äôll teach them!!I was so amused that no one actually talked about how free enterprise works for NASCAR nowadays. I think their attendance is down over 75% before they went all in for cunnilingus for the woke. These people are so lame and ineffective. I still figure its about time for a new false flag. Those people are getting ready for something.

            The reason Brandon Brown was pursuing that sponsorship from an obscure cryptocurrency is that traditional NASCAR sponsors are shunning him because of the ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go Brandon‚Äù line.  His only contribution to it has been winning the race and standing there while the brain dead NBC reporter told him they were shouting ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go Brandon.‚Äù  A competent organization would help him line up other sponsors so he wouldn‚Äôt be in that situation.  That‚Äôs not the Kwanzaa lovers at NASCAR.  They would rather run a driver out of the sport than even meekly push back at their corporate sponsors.

                Tell me about it.  One Indy 500 race day‚Äîor day after, we were over to the BIL house for family get together and dinner.  Lo and behold, he had recorded the Indy 500, and preceded to replay it on the TV for the whole family to watch!  Three hours of silent, painful, boredom, narrated by the BIL of course.  Near as I could tell, this was male bounding shit on her family side.Wife and I were newly married, but on the way home I read her the riot act.  I said I‚Äôd never visit her brother again if he pulled this shit, nor would I stay if he ever turned on the TV at a family gathering‚Äîhis home or any other.  I left it to her to inform her side of the family my masculine ‚Äúinadequacies‚Äù.

            ‚ÄúI was so amused that no one actually talked about how free enterprise works for NASCAR nowadays.‚ÄùThe example I like to use is NASCAR at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. They ran the first Brickyard 400 in 1994 to a full house (over 250K fans). When ‚ÄúThe Split‚Äù occurred between the open wheel racing series of CART and the Indy Racing League in 1996 all the racing ‚Äúpundits‚Äù warned people with ALL CERTAINTY that the Brickyard 400 was going to be a bigger event than the Indianapolis 500, just you watch!In 2003 I bought tickets for friends of ours and My Lovely Mrs. and I to attend a few months before the race.By 2019, the last race held with fans in attendance, I could‚Äôve walked up to the IMS ticket office race day and bought a ticket to sit pretty much wherever I wanted to at IMS for the race.2020 was the last Brickyard 400. The NASCAR race is combined with a third IndyCar race in the summer. On the road course at IMS, not the oval track.Parallels my experience with Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet. Back when they opened in 2001 I was informed to see the IndyCar race I‚Äôd need to buy a ‚ÄúTrack Pack‚Äù of tickets to all four races to go see one race. The cheapest package was $150, IIRC. üôÑBy the time we left Silly-nois Chicagoland had chased IndyCar out of the track, and was begging me to buy a four-pack of tickets for the NASCAR race for less than $100.Chicagoland Speedway hasn‚Äôt hosted a race in two years. It‚Äôll probably be bulldozed and a bunch of warehouses will pop up atop it.They shot themselves in the foot before they shot themselves in the head.

                What has most damaged auto racing is the elimination of the danger factor, and thus the masculine charisma that always underpinned the sport. Outside of sprint car racing, auto racing in AINO has been on the wane since the mid-70s, and F1 racing since the mid-90s.

        Caught the first few minutes of the local FM news radio ‚Äì the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù one with the Sean Hannity show on in the afternoon ‚Äì and the hosts were getting voice messages on their ‚Äúopen line‚Äù by normiecons saying the Capitol riot wasn‚Äôt all that it was made up to be. The cuck-twink who hosts the morning drive, and his brain-dead co-host, were replying to them to the tune of ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs not an insurrection, I don‚Äôt know what is‚Äù. Then a ‚ÄúMmh-hmm, dictionary definition!‚Äù from his co-host. THIS was a dictionary definition of propaganda as laid down by their corporate masters.

                    There were of course, those first into the breach, but I also saw video‚Äôs of laughing ‚Äúrioters‚Äù, graciously walking up the Capitol steps to be ‚Äúwaved‚Äù in by guards in uniform.  Which side of the building, I can not say.  But a ‚Äúgood time was had by all.‚ÄùSo what‚Äôs the point?  Well, in a large crowd, those in the rear are not privy to the actions of the front.  I can image dozens or hundreds in the back who‚Äôd never disobey a cop in uniform thinking as they moved forward that they were indeed allowed to enter the Capitol.Mens rea used to have meaning.  So did ‚Äúinnocent until proven guilty‚Äù.  And don‚Äôt forget the bail and speedy trial provisions of the (former) Constitution.  All this was legislated away after 9/11 with the ‚ÄúPatriot‚Äù Act signed into law by Bush The Lessor.Wise men predicted what would happen, but were ignored because the law would only affect some Muslim ‚Äúragheads‚Äù in Gitmo.We are ‚Äúall‚Äù ragheads now.

            At this point it simply looks like they are holding on to the Covidian gig because nothing has yet come along to replace it. It feels pretty desperate. They have really, really tried to move climate change back up to the front, especially if they can tie it with Covid, but the normies just aren‚Äôt buying it anymore.
Once some new crisis comes along, they‚Äôll move on.

        Considering the left has been crying for a revolution for over a century, you have to laugh at their sanctimonious patriotism now that they‚Äôre actually getting one. Maybe it‚Äôs because they‚Äôve realized that if there‚Äôs any revolution, they‚Äôll be on the business end of it.

            The Left has won a revolution, or at least thinks it has, so now the pivot is to force all the unclean to be patriotic to ‚ÄúOur Democracy‚Äù because dissent is now evil. Of course, the dumpster fire neither can be ignored nor extinguished.

            From your keyboard to God‚Äôs ear. I only wish that on January 6 there had not only been an actual insurrection, but that it had been successful. If it had been, a great many of the villains that bedevil our daily existence would no longer be among us.

            You‚Äôd think it would take, at the very most, 1 in 5 ignoring them to put an end to it.
I go back and forth on why that isn‚Äôt happening. Is it because the will to ignore is lacking? The temptation to believe that is great. Or are they, like a psycho ex, doing whatever it takes to keep the public‚Äôs attention? In that case, being more assertively indifferent, let‚Äôs say, would be in order.
Idk, my opinion depends on my mood, honestly, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs one or the other.

                Surely they can splice in some of the ‚Äúpeaceful protests‚Äù from Seattle, Minneapolis, Utopia, etc. They can also show an ‚Äúexpert‚Äôs‚Äù theory about how the racist Ashli Babbitt shot the aspiring rapper Michael Byrd, aka Da Byrdman.

            ‚Äù Kids will be learning about the Jan 6 Insurrection in schools for as long as the empire will exist.‚ÄùWhen HALF of the people come right out and say ‚Äù The January 6 Insurrection‚Äù is a Government pysop fake-flag lie, the empire is finished. There won‚Äôt be any kiddies being brainwashed much longer because that edifice of rot will be gone too. There won‚Äôt be any museums built because every Democrat Sh@thole city where they have those will look like Beirut, and their constituents will have long since looted anything of value they had there.The only question left is this: Does it all fall apart like the Soviet Union without a shot being fired, or do they actually start something leading to shooting. Right there is a question whose outcome determines if no one dies, or we lose 10 to 30 million in a final blaze.Scarry, isn‚Äôt it?

                when the shooting starts, the regime will have whatever man power it can muster, pinned down in the cities.   and that‚Äôs when their people in the field are wiped out.  followed by sieges on the cities.  no one is going to fight and die for this crew, no one.
most likely the biden admin personnel will be gunned down immediately (by a counter faction of the inner party) once shooting starts.

                    Well I figure the first thing to happen is the South cuts off all energy to Commie Land, and disconnects their power grid from them. I don‚Äôt think they even have one oil refinery up thereAnother thing is, they can‚Äôt even make guns like they did in 1861 to 1865. Most of those companies moved South of the Ohio awhile back. Had something to do with making those evil black rifles that honkies like to buy.

                    You never know whatXis going to be, and thus why they have to go full totalitarian lest some outlet be discovered.As an example, during Covid 2020 my state stopped issuing temp tags to sold cars as the DMVs were shuttered.  Or something, I think, and therein lies the issue as towards the end of 2020 probably 10% of the cars had no plates at all and no one really knew why.  It‚Äôs a short trip from there to everyone saying ‚ÄúF it‚Äù and not putting any plates on their car.  They pulled up on the throttle before it got completely out of control but there are other issues bound to appear.

                        Here in Hochulstan the done thing is to simply let the vinyl wrap peel off the bare aluminum plate, making the numbers very low-contrast and difficult to read.
This is in spite of the fact the state DMV site offers free replacement for decayed plates and stern admonitions about driving around with decayed license plates.
