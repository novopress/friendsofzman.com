        “Anti-Racism” (which of course really means Anti-White) strikes me more as some sort of luddite cult. It denies modern genetic science and technology and replaces it with superstitious ideas that they make fancy names for, like “social construct” and “white privilege”. If it was a cargo cult, wouldn’t they worship the white man as the bringer of all good things?

        The impact on peoples live aside, “diversity” is good from some real shits and giggles in the corporate world. A real life example.  A few years ago I get a panicked call the from the Chief Diversity Officer.  Basically, I’ve shown up on the EEOC tally reported to the Board as a Native American.  Told him I had absolutely no idea why.  Then it dawned.  A couple years before I took a 23 and Me genetic test that confirmed the family history of my ggg grandfather marrying a full blood Shawnee woman. (not well known that the midwest frontier was the embodiment of George Carlins’s adage, “if you can’t fuck it you kill it”–intermarriage was common, so was killing) Made the mistake of discussing this with the HR rep for my division, and she missing the part about my grandmother being the last one eligible for tribal membership, went downstairs and changed my status.  Apparently there was a bonus for SVP Native Americans.  That brought the revelation from the CDO, that since many people don’t self ID for race and the EEOC and Board demand stats, they engage in a modern day version of phrenology, where last name, appearance etc is used to fill in the best guess as to race. Apparently, an Injun was hiding in their midst.  Since it was December, we left it that he would make the change after the first of the year, so the “scorecard” for that year would not shift for the negative.This is what we’ve become.

        A short film; Kurt Vonnegut’s Harrison Bergeron was made as “2081”.a dystopian future in which, thanks to the 212th Amendment to the Constitution and the unceasing vigilance of the United States Handicapper General, everyone is “finally equal….” The strong wear weights, the beautiful wear masks and the intelligent wear earpieces that fire off loud noises to keep them from taking unfair advantage of their brains
As I remember a PG rated film, so no word on how they dealt with the ‘overly endowed’.  Ouch!

        They are the ones obsessed with racial categories, yet we are the Nazionalistes.They are the ones marching and lynching, yet we are the Klan.Yup.  Makes perfect sense from the good people who tell you that women are really men, and men should be women.

        I always like to think if there was true (and therefore total) diversity then everything would be done on a completely random basis. Elections for heads of government would be chosen from all the population — and no arguing about percentages as everyone is in the random selection process so everyone has an equal chance, irrespective of colour or creed or whatever — and so could easily be between a 13 year old child and an 89 year old granny. It’s just how the diversity draw works, so cast your votes now. Even the length of office could be diverse. You know, 47 years or ten minutes… hmmm.Naturally this would extend to everything. Lead actors in films would be equally diversely chosen and — this will please the anti-oscar lot — the prizes for best actor would be equally diversely random. A walk on part in a crowd scene could well get best actor, so that’s great.More, diversity would be fabulous in sports. At age 69 I could be a striker for my favourite football team or, better still, chosen to play in goal for my fave team’s cross-town rivals. I do understand that under a true diversity based system there is a chance that the NBA would still have the odd, very tall black person and yes, they would breeze past the seven year old but hey, that’s what we all want. Go diversity!There is however small nagging doubt in my mind about this wonderful future. Do you think people would be happy about it? Or would we still get, despite all the fairness and diversity, some people who would say ‘I don’t like it’?But as we can’t make anything more diverse than all diversity, surely a random and diverse decision of whether it is good or not is all that matters.

            Socially, the tool becomes more valuable than the professed goal.The tool grants authority, authority grants status.
Bah.  Eliminate gerrymandering, in use since 1820, when Van Buren turned the Democrats into a criminal syndicate.  Whomever lives in whatever county, you gotta work with them.  It’ll be plenty diverse.
