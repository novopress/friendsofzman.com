        As discussed before, the bungling of Trump 1.0 revealed the limit of his abilities. He clearly made some deals to get back behind the resolute desk. The first 100 days, the DOGE stuff, the gutting of USAID, and ICE raids are all results from a team that was most likely assembled to help him. Now the loudest voices in the oval office are steering him towards disaster.Back in March when Trump greenlit airstrikes against the Houthis, no one in the administration expected the op to turn into an international embarrassment. 2 F-18s flopping off the USS Truman deck (missile attack/arresting cable), 7 MQ-9s getting shot down and a billion dollars later US intel said the Yemen rebels only suffered ‘some degradation’ in their capabilities. The Houthis were able to target and engage F-16s and F-35s, with several close calls and they continued attacking our ships.Our military hardware very expensive and getting long in the tooth. The reaper is over 20 years old, the F-35 is pushing two decades as well. The F-18 and F-16 are dinosaurs. Ordnance and missile stocks are low. If Trump decides to go the air war route, the downstream consequences look bad on multiple fronts. The Houthis gave Trump the princess treatment and let him off the hook with a truce. Iran is a different animal. He should leave it alone and get back to domestic issues, especially immigration reform and deportations.

            “He should leave it alone and get back to domestic issues, especially immigration reform and deportations.”
Disagree somewhat.  He should get back to domestic issues to be sure, but one of those *is* the military.  a DOGE effort needs to be unleashed there.  $1T budget.  How much is wasted?  How much of our current defense/offense (in)capabilities is based on unworkable “wunderwaffe” boondoggles?
Ignoring big money for the moment, he has the authority immediately in hand to handle such an overhaul in his Constitutional role as Commander in Chief.

                “How much is wasted”
Well, I’ve heard over the years that our military is absolutely and unequivocally not ready for a major conflict were one to erupt tomorrow, it gets BTFO’d in every single wargame, and it can’t beat a bunch of bronze age guys firing missiles into the ocean, so it seems like all of it is wasted. Every single dollar. But note that DOGE never got near the DOD and Musk was chased out of the WH with his tail between his legs.

                    History has proven it is, in modern times, almosts impossible to defeat an enemy that does not play its part by surrenduring.
Saw the parade, Strykers? Abrams? Bradleys? The 1990’s are calling, they want their obsolete vehicles back.
I hear from my circle of Normies … they were duly impressed .. a tank!
God help us.

                        Scott Greer wrote an article about how the parade was for lowbrow White normie consumption, and at that it probably succeeded. But for the rest of us… wow.We saw how well those weapons did against a modern army in Ukraine. The answer is… not good. That should have been a wake up call in the Pentagon. it probably was, for some. Then the manufacturers got some senators on the phone and the matter was put to rest. The Pentagon and the “defense” budget is not to win wars. It is to procure weapons. It’s very good at that, but that’s not the same as winning wars.

                            IMO it would have been nice to see just the Doughboys, Continental Army … as a marching military museum would have been better than an inadvertant … military museum.
I guess Greer is on to something, since the target audience would not be our adversaries … nor anyone in the know.

                                Went to the article by Greer. I see there was all of 1 comment, and the first link to ‘something, something Conservative’ wanted me to ‘donate’ $$.
Please.
His article could have been written by AI, with a few sentences edited to sound human. Reading it did not make me any smarter, nothing learned I did not know already.
Perhaps his piece was also for the “lowbrow White normie” you mentioned??

The 1990’s are calling, they want their obsolete vehicles back.”In fairness to Musk, 100% of everything he’s doing in the Outer Atmosphere can be switched over to Military use in a literal blink of an eye.At this point, Musk is essentially the future of the military.I don’t know that even the F22s are of much use anymore; their payloads are way too small to do any harm to hardened targets.In the 21st Century, the arms race is all about space Space SPACESPACE!!!And, so far, we continue to dominate SPACE.Knock. On. Wood.PS: If he’s smart, Trump would use a lengthy war with Iran to re-route Congressionally-approved Pentagon funds, away from “obsolete 1990s vehicles”, and would instead [surreptitiously] invest all of that money in 21st Century Outer Space Weaponry.Sacrifice all the F22s &amp; the F35s in a purposeless war in Iran, whilst secretly diverting the bulk of the Congressionally approved funds to Elon Musk &amp; the Space Force.That would be 4- or 5-dimensional chess.PS: And continue making as many Ballistic Submarines as the production lines can produce.PPS: And then open up even more production lines to make even more Ballistic Submarines.

                Military strength doesn’t come from spending a trillion Dollars a year on the military, it comes from industry.America went into WW2 a fairly bit military player. It emerged the biggest and most powerful military in the world.  That was because a large percentage of industry was directed to military production. We built 90 aircraft carriers, hundreds of fuel ships, hundreds of non-carrier ships, 70k war planes and the atomic bomb.We couldn’t even make 16 million uniforms or pairs of boots today. We haven’t faced a worthy adversary in 50 years.  Even then, the Vietnamese defeated us.We are not the same country we were in 1940.  Our cities are 3rd world hellholes. A lot of our rural areas are in ruin with 1/2 the people using or selling drugs.  We have little industrial capacity. We don’t have the trained workers.Our military looks great on paper and against 3rd rate adversaries who can’t fight back.  The idea that we can defend Taiwan from China is comical.  China is winning the peace, so hopefully this never actual comes to pass.

                        One of the limitations of German WW2 logistics was their heavy reliance on horse-drawn carts.
Of course FDR made sure to send massive fleets of trucks to the Soviets.

                            One of the most incredible stories of WWII was the production of the A6M “Zero” fighter plane that was nearly invincible early in the war. Mitsubishi had no airfield at their factory and the Zeros had to be transported to the airfield for testing on an oxen-drawn wagon.

                    The problem is three-fold. First one is the industrial base. We got rid of so many shipyards and aircraft production facilities, along with all of the needed subcontractors in favor of the “Peace Dividend” after the end of the Cold War.We also got rid of many of our government-owned aircraft repair depots and shipyards with all of those custom-built machine tools and other infrastructure that you can’t regenerate overnight.Then it’s a people problem. Many of the old tradesmen retired after that great dismantlement or went to do something else. Most of them are either dead or too old to pick up that sort of work again.Lastly, our procurement system is completely FUBARed. The customer (the DOD) constantly changes their requirements. Contractors have a perverse incentive to low-ball the cost on a system and just get the rest back through overruns (got to avoid that Nunn-McCurdy breach there) or in tech support contracts to fix problems that should’ve been fixed in testing.We are building a frigate based on a European design. The Navy decided it didn’t like it and the design went from the intended 85% commonality with the European original design to 15% and is years behind schedule.The Army built an armored, tracked vehicle with a big gun that it swore was not a tank. It was designed to be carried by C-130s (they can’t carry the pork M1A3 Abrams), but now the new M10 Booker is too heavy for that. It broke 3-4 bridges at Fort Bragg because it was too porky.Thankfully the Trump administration cancelled it, but think of all of that money wasted on the program and now the requirement will go unfilled.

                        I grew up just outside the gates of Mare Island Naval Shipyard, the primo sub maker and port on the west coast.  Washington closed it in the mid-Nineties to ‘save money’, decimating the town.My paternal grandpa was a career master machinist on the ‘Yard’.  He and his cronies made the parts for your ships in WW1 and WW2.  My dad was an officer in the merchant marine in wartime.Where will Ms. Amerika find their like again?  And how long would it take for her to fire or cage them, given their unrepentant — and occasionally dangerous — masculinity?The U.S. had everything, and in its greed and thirst for female empowerment, threw it all away.

                        We are building a frigate based on a European design. The Navy decided it didn’t like it and the design went from the intended 85% commonality with the European original design to 15% and is years behind schedule.Is this the ocean-going frigate that is being built at a freshwater shipyard in Wisconsin, of all places?I love the Great Lakes, but for pete’s sake, you can’t simulate an ocean environment there. The Lakes are huge, but the world’s oceans are a different order of magnitude when it comes to waves and wind.There is also the matter of saltwater, which is a far harsher environment than freshwater for just about every material on a vessel.Between these factors, I have no idea how anyone on that program can honestly believe that they can design those boats to and successfully pass them through a real MIL-STD-810 environmental test cycle. The mind boggles.

                        In a system like that I can easily imagine a byzantine level of corruption and inefficiency.
M10 Booker reminds me of Polish WPB Anders, a “hopeful” project that went nowhere as the brass controlling the procurement kept changing the requirements (they still do). Lately, Taiwan cancelled the Clouded Leopard procurement which makes this type of armament quite unlucky so far.
This erosion of military-industrial capacity is pretty much universal in NATO. The empire switched its military system with War on Terror and the vassals followed suit.

                Overhauling the military IS a domestic agenda.  A crucial one, because the enlisted ranks still are the most trump-friendly of all institutional elements.  He must make use of that.And you are right, he needs to retire 3/4 of the general staff, toss the princesses and homos and etc. out, and make sure with the rest of his domestic agenda that the Ebil Ebil White Males WANT to enlist in his forces again.That means dumping permanently the feminist agenda and the rest of the identity agendas that run everything in New Amerika, including the armed forces.Now, will he do that?  Highly unlikely.  But it ain’t my job to teach folks to swim, just to fill the pool.

                I actually think the wunderwaffe might be even more difficult to cut back on now. A lot of people probably think that using the military as a laboratory for wacky social experimentation can still work because we have all these magical gadgets that nobody else has. It’s another form of American exceptionalism. Sure, having your male officers prancing around in high heels is probably demoralizing as hell for the kind of basically normal and traditional people that typically join the military but hey look – laser cannon!The problem is that it’s obvious now that our technological advantage has been lost and that other nations, especially Russia and China but also even places no one thought of as “high tech” like Iran (or Yemen!), havemoreadvanced weapons than we do. You can go one of two directions based on this knowledge. You can sober up, stop tolerating crazy utopian experiments and refocus the military on masculine virtues and make it absolutely focused on normal people and traditional morale boosters. Alternately, you can double down on the crazy but start a new DARPA sort of initiative that will claim that (provided it gets all the quadrillions of dollars it wants) the US will soon have teleporters, warp drives, and fusion powered planes with anti-gravity. Now, given the nation of total goobers that we live in and it’s utterly degenerate ruling class, which option do you think we’ll go with?

            It’s not just the age of the equipment, it’s the incompetence of the new Identity Armed Forces.  Your daughters plus a bunch of homos aren’t going to win any wars, nor even any skirmishes as with the impoverished Houthis.Sure, they can wear the insignia and get called ma’am all day and push the automatic buttons, but beyond that . . . well let’s just say that The Revolution finally will run out of self-delusion and deception, and smack straight into the wall of Reality, as embodied in basically any masculine nation that wants to test New Amerika.Who will design and build the next level of jets — or alternative technology — that the U.S. needs to compete?  The competent white men, sixty years in to being the nation’s Perennial Enemy, are either dying, retiring, or like myself, just saying FOAD to New Amerika.The consequences are going to be eventful and very, very much earned.

                I’ve said this before, and it’s worth mention again for new readers, we are pushing the limits outlined in the theory of the “Smart Fraction”.  Worth looking up…AI (?).  Basically, it states that a 1st class technological society depends upon a fairly small fraction of the population being at the right end of the Bell Curve wrt IQ.  When that decreases beyond a point, we start to decline.Point here is that we might not feel the decline evenly across all aspects of society.  We might see bridges begin to collapse yet still direct remaining (Smart Fraction) engineering resources to designing 6th generation fighter jets.

                        No point at all Ray.  Just pointing out a common detraction from the theory.  Decline is possible without notice in many areas and can be gradual and initially imperceptible.  Nonetheless, we are getting stupider as a nation—and that really is the motivating driver wrt reaching “the high ground” of AI before the tsunami of 3rd world mediocrity overwhelms us.

                While true, it’s notsolelythe fact that the military is corrupted by DIE. It’s not as if Chesty Puller’s and Douglas MacArthur’s 100% masculine military was able to win a resounding victory in Korea, or that drafting millions of males only created a winning formula in Vietnam.
It’s imperial overstretch, and a detached class of mandarin politicians calling the shots and committing us to wars that are either unwinnable, or winnable only at a cost they are not prepared to pay.

                        What we know is that it suffered from extensive speculation on land and the bloated, cosmopolitan city of Rome had little soldiers to defend with. Even while Rome remained ahead technologically, its force generation capabilities were declining, making more and more room for thefoederatiallies that eventually turned on the Romans.
I can easily imagine arms grift happening in those conditions.

                    A lot of it is this idea that you can have “limited war.” War is like pregnancy. You’re either at war or you’re not. There is no such animal as a “police action” or “nation building.” We’ve forgotten that war should be rare and brutal. Take off the gloves and destroy the enemy completely. Gut their will to fight. Lobbing some lazy cruise missile strikes or bombing empty bits of jungle that are supposedly “truck parks” is the antithesis of this approach.We need to stop intervening in conflicts that don’t concern us. No need for thousands of Americans to die in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and AFG for no perceived payoff or vital national interest.

Army is 50% White, 21% black, 18% mestizo, 16% womyn.Air Force: 63% White, 15% black, 17% mestizo, 21% womyn.Navy:  45% White, 18% black, 18% mestizo, 21% womyn.Marines: 54% White, 11% black, 26 % mestizo, 9% womyn.
Throw in a handful of Asians (east and south) and ‘multi-racial’ mystery meats, and you have one ugly and representative pie.

                    All too true, but I believe the military top brass in their quiet moments realize this.  They also notice, that our modern military has a “tooth to tail” of about 1 to 5 at best (depends on branch) and often higher.  Meaning that the boots on the ground can be predominately White, while the support structure can suffer from the “blessings” of diversity with little degradation in lethality.Now I didn’t say I bought into this, just that 50+ percent White might be sufficient in military planning.  What I will never believe however is that the top brass doesn’t realize the folly of DIE in the ranks—regardless of their public pronouncements.

                We sent our vaunted weapons to Ukraine, only to have them revealed as obsolete, along with those of the U.K., Germany, the whole bunch.If we HAD sent our people, what makes one think they too would not have been revealed? I don’t mean 6 Delta guys, or their ilk.Getting to Ukraine, from Poland …. is easy street compared to getting ‘boots on the ground’ to Iran. We did not go east, and if the IDF, themselves a military force living in the ‘Heights of Courage’ …. aka the PAST … can feel free to.I don’t recall the IDF beating Hamas, let alone any other adversaries since what, their last ‘pre-emptive war’ of 1967?This is the good news — the weakness = the hope for normal people that wars will be fought with schoolyard words … and some missile and drone exchanges. Not the scorched earth of World War 2.

            He should leave it alone and get back to domestic issues, especially immigration reform and deportations.One hundred percent, although it can be argued that neutralizing the military before the Left can unleash it on the citizenry–which will happen–has to be a consideration. The same Left howling about the use of the military to repel an internal invasion will have no problem with using it to terrorize white Americans.That aside, literally everything is downstream from mass deportations. It goes unsaid, but I think one consequence of throwing open the borders has been the public’s total disassociation from D.C.’s war fantasy games. The ruling class refused to do its main job, which is protect the American people, and in turn the citizenry has no interest in participating in D.C.’s imperial ambitions. Israel is doomed anyhow, but you can superimpose this same attitude post-betrayal on all foreign adventures.

            I would agree with most of your points, especially that Trump should switch to domestic issues.As for the F-35s, the oldest ones were bought around 2007-2008, so they’re pretty young. Also, it’s all about fatigue life. Even the B- and C-model jets, which are heavier than the A-models used by the Air Force and most foreign operators, have a minimum life of 8,000 flight hours and that’s with some time spent at sea.At about 180 to 250 hours per year per jet, that’s 32 years at the worst case scenario. We’ve fatigue-tested to failure all of the F-35 variants and they are strongly built aircraft that didn’t fail structurally until we put the equivalent of 24,000 hours on them. The rigs they use to test aircraft for fatigue are monstrous.The F-22s are struggling from some obsolescence in their avionics, but their structure is similarly sound. They’re older than the Lightning, but the way fighters are built now, 10-15 years is in the prime of life for these aircraft.Yes, the F-16s are old, but many of them have been through a FalconUP structural upgrade that will take even the oldest airframes to 10,000 hours, up from the original 8,000 (depending on the block. The Block 70s we sell to foreign operators now are built for 10,000 hours and possibly more right out of the box).The Block 70s are scary good jets, with a similar active electronically-scanned radar with no moving parts that track a gazillion targets simultaneously to the F-35 and a similar giant single display like the Lightning as well. And they’re an F-16, the last aircraft you want to see in the merge with a visual range dogfight.The Super Hornets (only the Marines operate the legacy C/D old-school jets from the 1980s and 1990s) are in the process of what they call a “center barrel replacement” where the main, central structure of the fuselage is completely subbed out for one built by robots in St. Louis with a tenth of the parts as the original and 50% more fatigue life.Then they rewire the jet, put in refurbished or often new engines and it’s basically a zero-hour airframe.The new F-15EX is even crazier. It has a new fly-by-wire control system that allows it to carry even more ordnance, the biggest AESA radar build in the U.S., a very nasty new electronic countermeasures system, two new, far more powerful engines and an airframe rated conservatively at 24,000 hours.

            The Houthis were not the Houthis. That is, a bunch of 70 IQ illiterates did not target the Truman 200 miles out to sea and moving. That was Russia not even Iran and as payback for sinking the Moscva, and a lot of other stuff. [Pre hitting the bombers I think].Remove Russia from the equation and Iran has few friends. China, maybe, but China is not going to do much now for Iran. Certainly not intervene militarily when Taiwan and southern Japan (to protect the Taiwan flank) and Guam and other targets are on the menu.The mistake is to see domestic and foreign stuff separately. Like everything else they are intimately connected. Pivoting away from Ukraine in a “deal” to get Russia to step aside has a bunch of benefits. Chief among them the paying cash certainty of the Gulf vs. guns/butter debate about aiding Ukraine vs. more goodies domestically.

        Trump as a merchant can still break a huge number of things. On the docket are things that could set the stage for going from hegemon with a geography and weapon system that could have ensured an eternal American power, to an incendiary pile of plebian racial factions and rival alien ruling factions able to command the continent as satraps on behalf of their Asian homeland.Here is what he is forsaking his duty to deal with or actively pursuing that will bring ruin at home:The open invasion and colonization of vast swaths of territory that is openly supported by the colonizer’s home government. Not a peep of disavowal or warning from Trump.Inviting in 500,000 alien rivals from our greatest enemy to take away positions and opportunity from American men and who will become a certified/legitimzed potential ruling overclass and satrapy for China or India or both in some or all regions.Opening up pristine American federal lands to be sold off to the highest bidder for developing “housing.” It will likely be prime land sold off to international plutocrat buyers who use it for vacations and travel stops.Selling off American citizenship to the highest bidders in the international plutocracy and giving them special privileges and access to investment and tax shelters and probably political power.In essence, Trump is accelerating and facilitating the completion of the destruction of America and the total dispossession of the American people. He is better than Kamala in some respects. In others, like formalizing foreign predation and selling off the country he may prove to be far worse.I am sick to death of the foreign focus. America is bleeding out and the hour is very late. Trump appears to be carving her up while the organs still have a market value rather than weilding his sword and leading the charge with his countrymen at his back.Businessmen can’t run a civilization. They must be brought to heel by more noble men and be its servants to fund its upward development. If not, they prove to be termites who gorge themselves on its foundations.

                Yes. Leftwing Jews care much more about hurting Russia than propping up Israel, which is their rightwing brethren’s main concern. The whackadoodle Christian Zionists have made the latter’s job easier for years but that faith is in rapid decline and its younger adherents are abandoning Israel First.

                    “The whackadoodle Christian Zionists … .”… do not exist and never did. One may be a Christian or a Zionist but not both. Christians worship the holy and undivided Trinity; they do not worship Israel. Christians do not “worship dumb idols and run after false gods.” So-called “Christian” Zionists, however, do exactly that. So-called “Christian” Zionists regard the Scriptures as a dime-store paperback on the astrological fortunes of this country or that. Christianity for them is restricted to “Woo-woo” scary stuff about “the future” and a mish-mash of gibberish that was generated by  a demented 19th-century convicted felon who did hard time in Missouri and Kansas for forgery and who had abandoned his lawful wife and daughter before embarking on his forgery ventures.“Christian Zionist” is a straight-up oxymoron.

                        Theologically, yes, but these types identify as “Christian Zionists.” I agree the notion is ridiculous on its face but these types have numbers and power, both thankfully is remission. They do not need to be any closer to foreign policy than Scientologists need to be running our healthcare system.

                            Part of what drives Christian Zionism is rapture theory, which appears to appeal to people because they don’t have to die. All for the low, low spiritual price of “blessing Israel”.

                        I can tell you from personal experience that Christian Zionists are quite real. I even built a website for one once (yes, I charged him for it and it wasn’t about Isra-hell). The existence and power of that faction of Christians, for me, is one of the black pills about the malleability of ordinary people and the power of propaganda to reconcile even the most obviously incompatible ideas.It’s also a reminder of how virtually everything in the US has become twisted around to serve almost the opposite of what it’s real purpose should be. I guarantee you that, now that summer is here, all over the nation, thousands of naive White evangelical high school and college kids are jetting off to some foreign shithole for “mission work” while kids just like them OD on fentanyl just a few miles away.

            The far right and far left have always had things in common. I recall the bailouts after the 2008 crash. The far right and far left (including Sanders) voted against it while the establishment of both parties pushed the bailouts through to save the “too big to fail”.

        In one of his lesser-known titles, Nietzsche employs the metaphor “philosophizing with a hammer.” In this case, he’s not proposing breaking stuff. Instead, he alludes to the practice of tapping a barrel with a mallet and from the resultant sound, one may judge how full or empty the container is. Applying that to Trump: even though he may not be able to break everything, even a tap with a hammer can reveal how empty are many established beliefs and structures. Very well, perhaps even a loud rap can break an illusion, at least for those who listen carefully.

From ChatGPT:
The book you’re referring to is Twilight of the Idols (Götzen-Dämmerung), written by Friedrich Nietzsche in 1888.

I disagree.  If you quote or use an exemplar from an authority figure, you should cite the reference for the edification of the audience.  We often don’t do so I admit, but it makes an assumption (knowledge/understanding) of the audience not always in evidence.  It’s good practice.

        Even though I am pretty much off the President TACO train at this point, I have to respect Trump’s ability to create a lot of pressure for his opponents with seeming ease.Doing the 2 more weeks thing on the Israeli’s is going to put a ton of heat on the Netanyahu regime since Tel Aviv is getting hammered a lot worse than the news is letting on right now. Every day of “maybe” that Trump uses is going to be another night of rockets for the Israelis.Israel likes to play tough but how much of that is actually real vs. a belief that old Foghorn Leghorn America is going to step in and stop and fighting before there is real blood.

            Yes. The Neocons realize the longer this drags out, the greater likelihood of (a) no US intervention, and (b) internal politics in Israel leading to Netanyahu’s ouster. I don’t know who in Trump’s inner circle came up with the two-week pause suggestion, but they clearly realize delay is working in favor of no intervention.

                    Quite true. There is, however, one big difference. (((Zelensky))) doesn’t care how many Christian Ukrainians die in that self-destructive process, much less Russians. None of them are Zelensky’s people, which is why the war has been allowed to drag on.Israel, however, contains millions of “chosen people” whose blood and treasure is actually valued. Unlike Ukraine, Israel’s leadership won’t sacrifice their own young people as cannon fodder. (Thus, their desperate bids to send Americans into the meat-grinder instead.)Heck, look how the Israelis hollered about a single hospital getting hit (not even flattened). Apparently, it’s a war crime when it happens to them, but not when Israel destroys every hospital in Gaza.Eventually, people notice such things. It’s not working in Israel’s favor.

            As just one generation on, this is all fun and games when you’ve got yours, and the next 20 years promises to meet your maker regardless. There are millions of people younger and sometimes much younger than Boomers. I don’t think there were ever many volunteers to live in the chaos of the end of empires. The frustration with the Boomers is that the world began and will end with them. It’s the lack of self awareness.

                Seems you forget who brought on the “post-Boomer” generation(s)—the Boomers.  No Boomer I know wishes hardship or extinction upon his own progeny.

        Iran comes out ahead in the long run. Let’s war-game this:1) Israel and the U.S. jointly attack Iran with air power.2) Neither can or will put troops on the ground, so the air attack ultimately fails.3) Iran rebuilds and now, rightly fearing invasion, has total justification to obtain a nuclear weapon as a deterrent, as the U.S./Israel attack had been an unprovoked act of aggression.4) Iran gets this deterrent, maybe with Russian or Chinese help. Maybe they are allowed to have a limited, WWII-style uranium bomb or a tactical nuke, but not MIRVed thermonuclear weapons.5) The GOP loses the 2026 midterms, Trump’s “America First” base abandons him, and politically he is toast for being seen as Bibi’s little bitch.Trump and Bibi go down in history as ass-clowns at best and aggressive warmongers at worst.

            “Maybe they are allowed to have a limited, WWII-style uranium bomb or a tactical nuke, but not MIRVed thermonuclear weapons.”
Once they successfully build a plutonium based bomb, they may have a thermonuclear weapons capability shortly thereafter as its follow on engineering, which in my admittedly ignorance, I considered quite possible for Iran’s engineers.  MIRV’d weapons I’m not sure can be prevented either, but they seem more complex.
In any event, Israel is only a short distance away.

            It is worth noting that there is one rogue nuclear power in the Middle East and it is not Iran. Iran is a signatory to the NNPT and allows IAEA inspections of its facilities. Israel is one of three nuclear powers that is not and never was an NNPT signatory* and does not allow IAEA inspections.As recently as last month (May 2025), the ODNI reported to Congress that Iran has no active bomb program, that it has remained shut down since Khameini canceled it in 2003.* The other two are India and Pakistan. Even North Korea was once a signatory, but later withdrew.

            On Friday, Macgregor had sources that said the strike was already greenlit. Beyond ambiguity, the delay was to redeploy assets to the region. Some mid tier analyst finally realized that they should evacuate the more vulnerable US military personnel, so a bit of that happened too.People like to point out the stupidity of it all without realizing how the decision making and planning gets done. Top level, mostly oligarchs, decide the strategic goals from their Davos volcanic lair which filters out via the think tanks. Then you have a two-tier strategic implementation layer split between the intel agencies, on one side, and the managerial class and/or military establishment on the other. Politicians like Trump are below them in strategic implementation. The smart fraction are stuck below the politicians, Colonel and below or equivalent on the civilian side. Their job is to make the pronouncements from on high achievable somehow, if only plausibly so for the highly deluded ones like regime change for Russia and Iran.The lack of second order thinking as well as the last second scrambling around is a side effect of how the people who actually know something about the real world are told last when the clock is already ticking. Their problems with or response to the strategic goals are not welcome and considered irrelevant.There was an old argument that claimed that free will was an illusion because it appeared like the brain, or particularly the left hemisphere, was reacting to what was being done. The left hemisphere was creating post-hoc rationalizations for what was already decided. While the argument fails against free will, it does illustrate how the imperial decision making process works.

                I am not sympathetic to Iran (or the Palestinians for that matter).But this is so outrageous it’s unreal. The U.S. just committed an unprovoked act of aggression against a country that never attacked it and never really threatened it directly.It is so transparently obvious that the Jews are giving the orders and that the U.S. government is wholly owned by Israel. Both parties, both Houses. No matter who is in the Oval Office.Remember how just after the Secret Service allowed some KID from Pittsburgh (about whom thelugenpresseis remarkably uncurious) to get within 100 yards of Trump and start shooting, they IMMEDIATELY started floating rumors that theIranianswere trying to assassinate Trump?LOL. Yeah, right.Israel was attacked by sandn_ggers with fucking HANG GLIDERS and — ZOG deployed TWO aircraft carrier battle groups. ZOG is now bombing Iran on behalf of Israel, which STARTED it.Can you blame the Iranians if they strike back? What if they blow up theNimitz?

You raise a good point regarding a possible false flag.
The optics of something like what you mentioned occurring on or around the 4th of July would provide a nearly iron-clad pretext for AINO entering a state of all-out war, which could include the domestic imposition of martial law.

There is a slight chance that this is more pro-wrestling style theater to permit a short-term reduction in hostilities by the Israelis.
Worst case?
Iran will shut down the Straits of Hormuz within 48 to 72 hours, possibly sending a barrel of oil to $120 or significantly higher.
That probably leads to $7 to 8/gallon gas and bye-bye economy.

            Trump is not going to save America. We’ve known we aren’t vooting our way out for decades. But … I think he’s a good step in the right direction. Demolition is a huge part of actually “building back better”. The idiot lefties that came up with that tripe will have to be destroyed, brought down in a controlled fashion…and their corpses and debris will have to be carted away and disposed of. Once all that is gone we can sit around scratching our heads, and hemmm and hawww about what we want our future to look like. I’d be happy with an end to jewish wars as a good start.

                That’s the American economy in a nutshell. Have you noticed all those grand old brands like RCA, GE, Magnavox, Aiwa, WESTINGHOUSE, etc. are just licensed out to other people who do the hard work of actually making things. CBS, the former Westinghouse, makes good coin licensing out the Westinghouse name.

        As an aside, somebody has been posting little video tours of Tehran, taken before the current hullabaloo.
It looks like America in the 1950s.  A lot of the girls don’t cover their hair (noted, outside of the capitol, still not allowed), but there are no mulling youfs, pridefests, or drug raves like October 7th.  The packed subways are clean, orderly, and quiet, the street cafes and bazaar are lively yet civilized.  They smoke over there, we wear our hair uncovered over here, so who’s to say who is freer.

            Great observation. Peter Hitchens wrote a long essay on his travels in Iran a few years ago; he hung out with Iranians in their coffee shops, did the tourist visits to ancient sites, and so on. Impression was that Iranians – aside from their government – are sophisticated people, well aware of the distinction between Arabs and themselves, descendants of empires preceding Islam by centuries.

                In AINO, they tend to call themselves Persians rather than Iranians. Seems pretty clear that a big part of their identity is the ancient and early medieval empires of Persia going all the way back to Medea and terminating with Sasanian Persia.

        “Israel will not be able to threaten her neighbors, expecting the United States to cash the checks she writes”Alas, that is wishful thinking. Jews never give up on their agenda. They will still have free reign to abuse people in Syria and Lebanon. Iraq will need to be paused. Gaza is the interesting scenario. What happens there in the short run?Nothing significant will change in the near term domestically and won’t as long as Jews wield so much power in the US. A very plausible scenerio is people vote Democrat enough in 2026 to win the midterms w/of the need to steal the election and 2028 to win the presidency to stop the war machine. Lol. Democrats and liberal independents will likely be convinced the Republicans are the war party (conveniently forgetting Ukraine) and peace will reign once democrats are back in power.Jews will then switch from their Zionist back to their anti white agenda. The right will buy more guns and not do anything.

            With all eyes on Gaza, Syria, Lebanon and now Iran,  Israel’s crimes in the West Bank are going almost  completely unnoticed. Israel has been brutally repressive — more than usual — in the West Bank since Oct. 7, but without the justification of Oct. 7, because the West Bank leadership had nothing to do with the Hamas attack.

        I suppose that one can pose the question rained by Leo Tolstoy inWar and Peace:  Are events created by great men or do events themselves cause certain men to stand out?.  (That’s a paraphrase, Tolstoy probably said it better.)  Is Trump the “Mule” breaking things, or are things breaking more or less of their own accord at the time that Donald Trump is in office.  It may well be from the perspective of 2040 or 2050, let alone the 22nd Century, that the American empire that (arguably) began with the Spanish-American War in 1898, had run its course and was disintegrating naturally after a high point of about 1991.  Similarly, the West, which has been the dominant civilization since about 1500, may have reached its apogee just before World War I, and is now in a downward spiral, to be superseded by Asian civilizations.  Trump may prove to be a minor, although colorful and entertaining character, in the parade of history.

            The big question would involve the circumstances concerning Netanyahu’s decision to go all “Pearl Harbor” on the Iranians.Was Trump informed beforehand that Netanyahu had decided on a “Pearl Harbor”?Might Trump &amp; Netanyahu have engaged in any dialogue, beforehand, concerning the “Pearl Harbor” option?Or was Trump completely in the dark when he learned that Netanyahu had launched a “Pearl Harbor”?A wise &amp; experienced &amp; brilliant leader would NEVER agree to a “Pearl Harbor” gambit.The “Pearl Harbor” gambit is always far too dangerous of a risk for any nation.My guess is that Trump did NOT know about Netanyahu’s decision to pull a “Pearl Harbor”, and that Trump is now furiously improvising to cover up the fact that Netanyahu had stabbed him in the back.Of course we’ll never get an honest answer out of the j00z, and Trump certainly won’t be in the mood to answer the question until well into his retirement.:&lt;CUE SAM DONALDSON VOICE&gt;: “Mister President, did you or did you not know beforehand that Prime Minister Netanyahu intended to launch a sneak attack upon the Iranians, or were you simply left out of the loop entirely when it came to the decision making?”

                There was a complete failure to control the leader of a very small country before he got everyone into trouble. And it’s not just this incident. Trump is a serial screw up who somehow comes out on top. Not so much his “friends”.The second I hit the post comment button I knew there would be angry pushback for this. But there always is when you tear the scales from other people’s eyes. People lash out against contradictions to what they need to believe. Trump is an arrogant, pompous, shallow narcissist. He has the right enemies but that does not make him good. Like a drunk sledgehammer, you can hope he breaks the right parts. But right now he seems more likely to break the wrong ones

On other issues Trump is on board with the total ai surveillance state, run by a private company. And on and on it goes. He is not a good guy. That’s nothing but a comforting fantasy.

In fact, it wouldn’t affect Trump at all, unless the person was able to convey their disappointment in his character to Trump personally.It would be an admission that one is not a good judge of character, and on the highest of levels — that would be very difficult for most people to do. Descartes says somewhere that men are envious of every other man’s possessions except one: his common sense. Most of us believe, no matter our level of education or experience, that we can size up other people pretty well and have life more or less figured out. We wouldn’t exchange it for another’s. Admitting that Trump conned you (for most, three times) would be devastating to one’s sense ofamour-propre.

                            Biden allowed at least 10 million poc s into the country.  Harris would have increased that number significantly.  Accelerationists who voted Biden gave us that many more 3rd worlders to outbreed us and to swamp us.  Demographic replacement trumps foreign policy on issue importance so while I find Israel’s actions repulsive I applaud the ICE blitz.

                        Yeah, but Netanyahu is many many orders of magnitude worse in every regard.Bibi is anextremelydangerous character for several reasons.One is that he spent significant parts of his youth in the US in the 50s and 60s. That means he has an excellent understanding of the American mind and culture. One key driver in his outlook was his rejection of what he saw as a superficial US lifestyle.That also means he speaks English at near native levels. He knows exactly what to say to Congress and his US backers and how to say it. Heck, I think one can argue his speaking style is better than Trump’s.We know that he is book smart, based on his record and reports about his time at MIT and Harvard. He zipped right through very heavy course loads.Unusually, Bibi has significant physical courage and ability, having been part of an IDF special forces unit that conducted cross-border raids. He was also wounded in combat on several occasions.Finally, we know that he is extremely politically savvy due to his sheer longevity. I believe his political daring was shaped by his time in the IDF.What is truly sad (frustrating?) is that someone with so many positive attributes and achievements has consciously decided to put those attributes in service of an evil cause which may bring grief to all mankind.

                    Any leader who allows and in fact facilitates what is happening in Gaza, is evil.   His higher “goal” is “great beach front resorts” however the truth is it is genocide by any other name.
By the time the Iran situation is over more hundreds of thousands of innocents will be killed, starved and/or die of exposure or disease.  All of this due to lies and false assumptions that are being fed to him.  Worse he wants to believe those assumptions.
Trump is not in any way a thoughtful man and he is not the man his supporters think he is.

Disagree—if one considers we are at war with Iran.  Generating consternation and fear in the enemy’s home front is part and parcel of such undertaking.  How is that different than Iran sending undirected missiles into Tel Aviv where they can only destroy the populace, rather than their military?
War simply sucks.
Disclaimer:  The above tacitly assumes Trump knew what was coming out of his mouth.  Doubtful.

                        The Gaza Palestinians now suffer, are largely powerless, and wear the victim hat. When they weren’t powerless, over decades they proved to be among the most fanatical among Arab Muslims.“Genocide” is bandied about far too liberally these days. It’s not a descriptive term any longer (if it ever was), but a political rallying cry.Also, not all “genocides” and ethnic cleansings are born equal, it appears. Hardly anybody noticed, let alone raised a finger when the Azeris recently all but cleansed the Armenians out of Karabakh. Arabs decimating African Darfuris by the thousands? What the heck.So, a subtext of the whole Gaza thing is that mainstream Muslims groups are privileged victims. And they are’nt exactly our friends either.That’s not to say in the least that the Israelis in the ME and their diaspora in the West are sane and benevolent actors.Let’s dissociate mentally from all involved (okay, with some are nuances) and care for our own White societies first and foremost.

                            Let’s dissociate mentally from all involved (okay, with some are nuances) and care for our own White societies first and foremost.I enjoy the fact that you think others don’t share the same goal, and that you need to issue moral instruction to us in order to assess this situation in the right light.The problem has been that Americans CANNOT DISASSOCIATE FROM ISRAEL. EVER. HERE’S ANOTHER HOLOCAUST MOVIE. HERE’S A COMMERCIAL FOR THE INTERNATIONAL FELLOWSHIP OF CHRISTIANS AND JEWS.It hasn’t stopped since the 1970s. I know very few people who care at all about Palestinians or their crimes (or virtues, as you seem to think some do).Deflecting this back onto Arabs and their putative hypocritical supporters in the West once again obscures the very problem. Intentional?

                                I don’t think Wilton is “deflecting”; note that one set of semitic victims heartlessly pushed another set of semitic victims into Europe just in time to light the match.
They use each other to advance each other’s unstated goals, as seen with Joseph and his brothers.
Also, the Muslims seemed pretty content to stay right where they were, until further “empowered” and incentivized by Judean manipulation.

                                This comment seems mainly to follow from observation of the “Boomer” generation.  The typical younger American can’t find Israel on a map, and will replace the Boomer generation within 20 years tops.
This will be the end of the special relationship between America and Israel.  Even now, many commenters are remarking on this mental separation and new realization of such.  It’s just a matter of time.

                            When you drop 2000lb bombs on hospitals or shoot children in the head, that is not self defense.   When snipers target old women in front of Churches who were Christians, that is not self defense. When you have government leaders calling for enforced starvation, that is not self defense.In the case of Gaza and the Palestinians in the West Bank you must consider that they have been kept in an open air prison for a long time.   That situation will reliably create mad dogs.   However they are certainly no worse than insane Israelis and the lengths they go to in order to dominate others.As to the other atrocities you speak of, as far as I know they are not endorsed by the President however I could be wrong.

                        This is quite a moral conundrum, but any talk of Gaza, genocide, and such needs an historical context.  Not going to bore folk with a lengthy history, but the Gaza Strip was turned over to these people (Palestinian Authority) by Israel 20 years ago.  Two years later, Hamas was allowed (?)  to take over by the people there and it was off to the races…so to speak.  Gaza was turned into a base of operations for a war against Israel.  Hamas turned the entire country into a military base from which to wage a war against Israel—precisely what was predicted by Israel at the time.Further, the Palestinians have fomented trouble and been expelled by every Arab country where they’ve settled in appreciable numbers.  So much so that no Arab country wants them—even as refugees.  All this is easily looked up.

                            A valuable corrective to the reflexive anti-Israel deluge, compsci. Look, I’m no fan of Israel. I don’t care whether it sinks or swims just so long as it does either under its own horsepower. But the Palis, Iranians and Muzz in general are no saints. There’s plenty of blame to go around. But the most important thing for us to keep in mind is that we don’t have a monkey in this circus.

They don’t block the street at noon to pray en masse outside the temple.
Even if they were elected Prime Minister of Scotland, they wouldn’t immediately start ranting about how there are too many white people in Scottish government.
There are degrees to uncivilized behavior…theirs at least abides by the norms of European corruption.

                                I’d rather have Muslims. You KNOW that they are the enemy because their are sensible queues, optical and audio, that they do not hide. They do not hide that they are going to spread at your expense their patterns genetic and memetic (cultural).The Ashkenazi Jew is specialized in infiltration and conquest of the control nodes of European societies. Way too many of our dumb-dumbs never perceive beyond the superficial.I used to think the Mongols were the greatest evil that befell the Earth. They killed about 1 in 6 of all humanity when they exploded out of East Asia, not all at once but over several centuries. However, it was conquest not killing that was the objective. War was a means to the end of getting other peoples, other aggregates of genetic and memetic patterns, to bend the knee in submission. Yes, they had to kill a lot of people to get submission, but if you bent the knee they would not extinguish your genetic and memetic patterns.Jews are on the other side of that continuum. They are not conquerors of patterns, but destroyers of them.  Moreover, it is clear that many delight in mutilating the patterns first. Weaponized cultural degeneracy is a kind of memetic mutilation preparatory to genetic destruction.Bending the knee will not only not save you, but instead ensures your destruction.I’m sorry it is this way, but it is what it is. We ignore the numerous warning signs at our peril. If Israel falls they are going to end up here, angry and with their hatred of the goyim plumbing new depths. Our suffering is going to intensify such that even people we have treated badly, like Russians and Germans, might feel sorry for us. Germans in particular (who have given the most to humanity) need to get their country back, build nukes to aim at former America, and ally with Russia against it. May God help us all, even though we probably don’t deserve it.

                            Correct. Gaza was a shithole and the Palestinians are the n1ggers of the Middle East. Presently their women and children are suffering terribly, but that does not mean it is America’s duty to side with them.Nor is it America’s duty to side with Israel, though. The Israelis really do treat the Palestinians like shit, and they seem to sadistically enjoy doing so. People seem to have forgotten that the Jews gleefully defiled the al-Aqsa mosque only a couple of weeks before Oct. 7.One is tempted to say that the way the Israelis treat the Palestinians isn’t much different than the way the Nazis treated the ghetto Jews… except that isn’t true. The Nazis actually gave the ghettoJudenratssome autonomous decision-making and policing power, and the German troops were more disciplined than the IDF when it came to dealing with civilians.

                                Yep. To be brutally honest, the only thing of American interest that Israel has going for it is that *if* Israel is overrun, America will could double its Jewish population seemingly over night.  Unlike SA Whites, the Jewish power base here is massive.  We’d take each and every Israeli Jew into the United States as a permanent refugee.

                    Someone needs to consult a calendar here.  The little man in Israel started the war to destroy Gaza well before Trump took office.  He also has beat the drums of war with Iran for *20* years now.
Trump could do better wrt Israel, but it did not start in his watch.

                        If the Israelis want to eradicate the Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank, I would be in favor of not supplying them the weapons to do so from the U.S. Taxpayer. I would also appreciate a President who does not cheerlead the endeavor. It appears quite unseemly when he does that.

                    First, you act like Trump’s flaws were a big secret that nobody knew.  Trump is a flawed man, like many others.Do you think Kamala was a better pick? Biden?  How about Hillary?  Obama? Dubya? Clinton? Bush? Reagan?  How far do you want to go back?For all of Trump’s flaws, and yes, I too am pissed at him, he was by far the best candidate and the only one who talked about issues important to us, like immigration.  While all the war chaos is happening, foreigners are still being deported, though not fast enough.  A Harris regime would be importing foreigners even faster than Biden was.The GOP is and has been terrible for generations.  John McCain and Mitt Romney were the best they could do in the 21st century.  Both are far, far worse than Trump.

I hope that’s true, and I hope that the Truth of the matter will so infuriate Trump that he will finally dispense, once and for all, with this obscene decades-long judeophilia/philosemitismwhich has been his family’s curse.
Trump minus thejudeophilia/philosemitism would be something of 21st Century Saint.

            This is all very interesting, except, what kind of “invasion force” can “the world’s superpower” muster? The last time I read about this, the AINO military has about three divisions – 45,000 troops – battle ready. For perspective, the Wehrmacht invaded the USSR in June 1941 with about three million troops spread over a nearly thousand mile frontier – with all their supplies and replacements directly behind them. AINO’s “expeditionary force” of 45,000 would be spread over the 750 miles you noted, not open plain as the Germans faced, not supplied by easy land routes… sounds to me more like Benedict Arnold’s “assault” on Quebec, when the citizens of that town laughed at and even pitied this frozen, under-equipped rabble…

        Fixing relations with China is near impossible.  Even if you sign a deal with them, their signature isn’t worth the paper it isn’t printed on. China is probably the only country whose signature on a deal is worth less than America’s signature.   China does not follow rules.  They’ve been in violation of every term of the WTO since they entered it.  They don’t even follow their own rules internally.

                I suspect you are both a little bit off here.  China does what China does in its own interests.  Son has some dealings with them. They simply don’t have the Western values based on a “trust” society.  It’s up to you to avoid being cheated by them.  If the contract you sign has a “work around” to their advantage and you’re disadvantaged by such, they’ll use it.  It’s your job to be cautious and avoid being “cheated”.Also, the Chinese State has laws wrt joint business ventures, such as majority stake holding to be Chinese and exchange of trade secrets mandated.  Who forces you to sign such contracts?  Greed, that’s who.  That’s the Chinese fault?

        Very interesting podcast, Z. I think the key point here is that the Israelis told Trump that they could wipe away the middle east issue in 24 hours, just let us do it. When it looked like they succeeded, Trump was out there strutting like a peacock. When it became obvious the attack failed at its objectives, he started to push Iran to surrender immediately. When they didn’t, well now he is saying two more weeks, which means that he is pissed at Netanyahu again and wary of heavy US involvement. Of course that could change tomorrow. It probably will change tomorrow. But this seems like a plausible chain of events.

        It’s often been stated that the value of the US dollar is backed up by military force. So what happens to the dollar if and when that force is seen to be lacking? That’s why I think Trump has no other choice but to bail on Project Iran now, before US impotence is exposed for all to see, making this a true Suez Moment. Bibi demanding support, and coercing or blackmailing Trump and Congress to get it, doesn’t make the war winnable.Maybe it is already too late to avert that outcome/perception. But the world needs the dollar in a TINA sort of way. Globalization and many economies depend on it (perhaps even most economies). The GAE’s rival powers don’t want to give up the dollar, or they already would have. For this reason I believe they’d be willing to overlook some degree of GAE fecklessness, in order to keep the plates spinning. Donald doesn’t have to shove that fecklessness in their face.

            It’s too late, JZ. The world already sees the weakness of the American position and how to exploit it. As our Esteemed Blog Host said, they just have to wait us out. Then the democrats will be back in power and they’ll pay through the nose for the rope to hang themselves.Which to me, begs the question: the Donks came very close to destroying the country with Biden. The next whack a doodle is almost certain to be worse. The only way to avert that now is a good successful beer hall putsch, followed by a deep cleaning purge and cleanse, a la Joseph Stalin. Can it be argued that Blumpf needsMOARTNT?

        Perhaps the saddest part of this is it demonstrates once again that elections cannot change anything. America cannot be made great again without a new political party led by people independent of [redacted] and the corrupt American Establishment. These people would have to avoid being assassinated or arrested and prosecuted by the American Establishment. This would require militant supporters willing and able to use violence. Who is there to lead such a movement? The American Establishment will not permit any such force to appear. The American Establishment would not even permit Americans to protest a stolen presidential election.In light of his late record, you wouldn’t expect words of wisdom to come from Craig Roberts. Yet those are wise words.

        I don’t see anyone discussing long term repercussions if this thing goes sideways.Closing the Strait of Hormuz for 6 months would have massive global impact.ONE example:  US airlines directly employ about a million people (mechanics, gate agents, pilots, flight attendants, etc.)  They indirectly employ about ten times that. (Travel industry, AC manufacturing, etc.)A 30% spike in oil prices would 1.) cost the industry billions 2.) cause demand to plummet.Bankruptcies post 2000 and Gulf War adventurism:TWA (gone), US Airways (2x bk, then merged), ATA (2x then gone), Delta (1x), Northwest (1x, then merged), American (1x), etc.All direct consequences of Gulf War 2.

            A 30% spike in oil prices is about the most optimistic outcome with a full blown war in the Middle East with the Straights of Hormuz shut down and Saudi oil fields offline.  More likely is 300 Dollar oil with shortages.

                Yeah, oil demand is very inelastic.  A doubling in price would be the short term aspect.  Of course, we’d need to pump more in the USA for our needs—we don’t  use that much ME oil these days.  Immediate shock, recession, etc.  perhaps a year for things to settle out.

        by destroying the white working class, the white upper class gets a huge advantage from the monopolydescendants of white upper class easily inherit their parent status, because there’s no competition from working classThe issue lies in the fact that ethnic minorities outnumber the white upper class, and those minorities do not view the white upper class as the same species.
The white upper class’s shortsighted greed is causing the decline in Western countries, which is harming their people and removing their protection from the outside world.

        The delay of two weeks is something I don’t understand. Is there a “deal” with Russia (Trump told Pompeo and Graham to shut their mouths or bad things can happen to them re: Ukraine)? Something else? Stalling for time?If Trump does strike Iran and we have a whole host of Iran sponsored terror attacks by sleeper cells who came across during Obama’s third term, allowing mass deportations, would that be a win? [No more District Judges with any injuctions then.]I just don’t have any sense of what is really happening, but there seems to be something in the works. Just for funsies, Turkey is now claiming most of the Agean and Greek Islands as belonging to them, so we can have that popping off.

        Do you think that Ellul s “technique” is at play with this upcoming war? Could the blueprint or drive to efficiency or a set of rules be running things rather than people? The people switch out and the plan continues. Ellul seemed to say it can’t be stopped.im just getting into Ellul but he is really interesting

        People are getting all upset over nothing.Yes Trump bombed Iran. Obama bombed Libya. Nothing much happened to the US or his Presidency. See also Clinton with Serbia and also Iraq (Operation Desert Fox). Reagan I had forgotten not only bombed Iran in 1988 and sank their navy, he also bombed Libya in 1986 after Lockerbie.Iran does not have many or any real friends. Neither Russia nor China seems willing to come to its aid in any significant way. My guess is Trump will deal a “swap” — Russia gets a free hand from the US (no more support for Zelensky) in Ukraine and Russia ceases support for Iran. Both sides get what they wanted anyway. The US out of Ukraine and Russia focusing on its near enemy.The dog not barking is Hezbollah. Israel is bombing Iran and … Hezbollah is doing nothing. This suggests the Pager escapade was far more telling, and also that Iran’s government is running out of money. I assume there are still missiles and rockets in Lebanon. Just not Hezbollah guys getting PAID to fire them. The Generals in Argentina fled and their government collapsed after the Falklands defeat. The Regime is widely regarded as thieves who failed to defeat Saddam when the Americans did it easily, finally removing Saddam in six weeks. It took 8 years for the Iranian government to fight off Saddam with human wave tactics that left many families angry and broken. Iran’s TFR is around 1.6 so its not as if the dead were ever replaced. The regime has now failed with Hezbollah, failed with Syria, and failed with its nuke program. [I think Iran probably has some nukes, but an integrated missile system is another thing.] If they cannot pay Hezbollah can they pay their internal secret police and IRGC men?Iran probably can temporarily (they did this in 1988) blockade the Straits but they cannot hold it. The coast is mostly flat, not mountainous like Yemen. Easy targets just like last time. “They came at us in the same old way, and we defeated them in the same old way.”Yes we did not declare War. Neither did Putin with his Special Military Operation designed to prevent Zelensky from putting nukes to threaten Russia*. As noted, neither did Reagan (twice), Clinton (twice), Obama (once) so that is nothing new.Now we will have Bernie Sanders, the crazy loony Left, burning American flags, waving Iranian and Palestinian flags, big money Wall Street Jews like Bill Ackman doubling down on Republican donations, all sorts of crazy left assaults on 4th of July parades, various Iranian sleeper cell and lone wolf attacks, and more that will scare the hell out of big money Wall Street folks into supporting mass deportations.What America’s military did was remind everyone in the globe that while ground fighting is not our speciality, we do very, very well at putting lots of ordinance on supposedly “safe” bunkers and blowing the hell out of it. That for all the advances in drones and such, we can still with non-nuclear just destroy stuff. And that is without Rods from God which we probably have.  Iran will posture, create new “Lines of Death” like Khadaffi, maybe the regime will collapse, maybe it won’t, but its nuke program has been set back for years. Iran can flood the Gulf with mines like they did in 1988, but we can sink their navy, and bomb all their coastal batteries and demine like we did in 1988. It will cost more but it won’t be Iraq.Bernie “Open Borders Forever” Sanders is outraged. So is his non-binary gender-queer crazy White left “female” followers, AOC, the View, and Alex Soros. Things are breaking our way, as long as we stay out of any ground engagement which Trump seems to rule out. Enjoy the win. Its not 2003 any more than its 1933, or 1939. We cannot fall into old thinking any more than our enemies.Trump needs allies to stay in power. He now has the Military Industrial Complex with a new and traditional (since 1979) enemy, Big Money Wall Street, and MAGA Normie who likes an easy win. Dems will be baited into pro-Iranian, anti Military stances which is good for Trump and MAGA. [Gabbard re-iterated that it was the CIA’s judgement that Iran has had no intent or ability to make nuclear weapons. So its slam dunk they have at least ten and probably twenty. Given that the CIA is wrong more often than Jim Cramer.]*At the Vienna Security Conference in December of 2021, Zelensky was running around saying Ukraine was going to get nukes and launch them at Russia, and take back Crimea and not only “liberate” the Donbass but invade Russia. At the time I thought it insane and sure to provoke Putin. Putin has still not declared War despite pressure inside Russia to do so in order to fully mobilize and legalize things. I assume there are reasons for this that are compelling to Putin and his staff.

        Unspoken is the apparently serious attempt by Iran to assassinate not only Trump but family members and associates. In retaliation for Solemeini’s assassination. The latter was the architect and overseer of the Khobar Towers bombing so he already had a price on his head (literally). But Iran’s regime is non-Western: it is more Mafia like than bureaucratic. Khamenei has already ruled out “negotiations” so he thinks he can just wait out whatever Trump and Israel deal out and then continue on; Iran feels it is stronger than Trump. It is a fairly stupid move by the Iranians, they had a golden opportunity to simply kick the can down the road but seem to want an air war for whatever reason.If the plots are real, then yes Iran has chosen War on a personal level with Trump and will get it, good and hard. Trump is not limited, the way other Presidents are. He would be willing I think given personal threats to himself and family to nuke Iran hard, to remind everyone of the real power of the US if pushed. There are media reports that nukes are not off the table, not sure how real those are or if they are kayfabe.Question: would most people here trade nuking Iran for withdrawing from Ukraine and vigorous and expanded deportation of illegals? I have no answer myself.Air wars have caused regime change: Libya, Serbia, in part Syria. Iran is none of those but has no real solid ethnic/tribal backing for the regime like Iraq and Saddam. The ruling elites are despised, for being both corrupt and brutal, and for failing in the Iran/Iraq War. That the US destroyed Saddam in a few weeks that took eight years for Iran to get a truce not peace (and not victory) still rankles those who lost sons for nothing.I wonder if the US will use “rods from God” which I would be shocked if it did not have them, on Iranian bunkers.Israel seems to have varying relations with neighbor states. With Egypt it is correct but cold and hostile; Israel does not bomb Egypt but there is little cooperation. With Jordan and the Saudis it is under the table deep cooperation. Both nations allow Israeli jets to transit to attack Iran again and again as they all mutually fear Iranian expansion. Lebanon and Syria, being Iranian puppets, get bombed all the time. But I would flip that around and ask why Iran is constantly attacking Israel? Training/arming Hamas, Hezbollah’s existence is to rocket Israel, for what payoff? How does it even help the regime to attack Israel unless that is the moral basis for their legitimacy? “We rule because we JIHAD Little and Great Satan.” Just as neo-cons claim they rule “because we refight WWII as camp liberators!” Neither are based on Realpolitik.This is just as much can-kicking by Presidents Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, Bush II, Obama terms 1 and 2, Trump, and Obama Term 3. Iran has been a hostile, expansionist (aimed at the Gulf more than anything) tool of both Russia and China with no deals the latter to rein in Iran’s ambitions or “kill the chicken to scare the monkey.” Iran blockaded the Straits in 1988, and Reagan sank their navy in a day. Yes that was then, this is now per Emilio, but the issue was not solved, just cans kicked down the road. This is the end of the road.Perhaps Trump “deals” and has Russia withdraw support for Iran (it was Russians firing missiles at the Truman that made it flee; Yemenis IQ averages 70 and most are illiterate). In return the US withdraws support for Ukraine and vetoes any Article 5 by Europeans when not if they send expeditionary forces.Trump had little institutional support for withdrawing from Ukraine before; with the Middle East being institutionally the province of the Army, the Navy, Air Force, neo cons, media, etc. he would have institutional support for an above deal. Since all care far more about the Middle East than Ukraine. The Saudis, for example, can pay cash for arms while Ukraine needs Uncle Sam financing.

            The GAE could “win” against Iran by using nukes (that’s the only way they could), but “win” what? But even then a win is not guaranteed. Since the Iranian regime could wait out the nukes and still be there. Unless the GAE is prepared to eradicate the Persian population via nukes. I doubt that’s gonna happen.

                So, let the Iranians be taught the lesson that nuclear proliferation is so dangerous, so disruptive to the global order, that all means available – including nuclear annihilation itself – are legitimate and righteous responses to such proliferation.
The baseline assumption behind such ludicrous attitudes is that Iran is not a normal country. As opposed to, say, Pakistan, North Korea, Keir Starmer’s Great Britain, Macron’s France, Xi’s China, etc…
Let the fuckers have their weapon. Are they assholes? Of course they are. Not unlike all the other gangster regimes with nukes.
