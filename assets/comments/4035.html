        I really dislike evangelicals being raised as a Catholic, evangelical pastors are just a bunch of hucksters and their doctrine has nothing to do with Christianity, Gnosticism and Marcionism is more Christian than evangelism.

        It’s funny how Catholics take so much criticism over how we dealt with Gallileo and yet have the most accessible view of the realtionship between faith and modern theories of how things, and we, came to be.And this is not new. I was taught this way in school 45 years ago.

        A guy calling himself Gagdad Bob runs a stimulating and witty website (I believe the URL is onecosmos.blogspot.com but you can easily google him) on which he writes about theology and spirituality, as well as its various intersections with society and politics, from a nonconformist but by his own intention orthodox Christian perspective. Take a look.
His book One Cosmos also is worthwhile reading, exploring cosmological issues and how they interact with theology in a more methodical manner.

        If all this happened by accident it is pretty amazing stuff. On the other hand, there are flaws in the system that a clever designer might have voided, though perhaps he/she/it was pressed for time.
You never know what was on people (or deities) minds when they started the ball rolling.

            I think most people, including me, would accept that evolution is the best explanation of the fossil record. Genetic mutations, reproductive advantage et al let us understand the data better than any other explanation.The nature of science is that better explanations replace the old explanations. That means evolutionary theory will look a lot different 100 years from now, just as it looks vastly different today that in Darwin’s time.The great proof of evolution is politics. You vote for that guy who says all the things you want to hear. He heads off to the capital and evolves into a duplicitous reptile.

                There is, of course, the third view of all this which is rarely — and probably for good reason — not discussed much.We, and the universe around us, was (or is, for we are far from finished here) all one big experiment. “Let’s see what happens if you give them no rear vision capabilities, knees susceptible to ageing and an insatiable appetite for power with a large pinch of hypocrisy. Should be fun seeing what they do with that.’So a lot of careful games design and the deities can sit back with the celestial popcorn and enjoy what we do.‘Oooh, that’s gotta hurt. I never expected them to try that so early on!’

        I have privately called Evangelicals “Paulists” instead of Christians for some time.  I have seen blogs where someone quoting from the synoptic gospels (Mark, Matthew, Luke) to support a point got shouted down by people using quotes from Paul (a guy who of his own admission never met Jesus and who got his start persecuting Christians) and a smattering of quotes from the Gospel of John.To me, the most surprising thing about the Paulists is their utter rejection of the Synoptics’ call to do good works (there Jesus commands his followers to give all they own to the poor, along with the many healings, etc.) and their exhortations to “justification by faith alone.”This conflict between the Christians and Paulists is of course almost as old as the Christianity.  From the anti-Paulist Letter of James:“What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?  Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food.  If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?  In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.”

            That’s an excellent observation. I’ve never really considered it until now.

        I guess I’m an ID’er of a sort, although I quickly become bored with explanations like the above. The intelligence is in the design of the building blocks, you just don’t know what you are going to get each time around. And life on earth has had a couple of trips from scratch.

            James, I think your view is a) not what the ID’ers are preaching and b) well within the mainstream of Christianity. Catholic schools, to the best of my knowledge, still use the watchmaker analogy to teach Aquinas and his proof of God.As I said in my post, Darwin was comfortable with that view. A lot of people in the evolutionary biology  often have no interest in Big Bang origins of the universe stuff. How it all started is simply not relevant.What the ID’er preach is a god-in-the-gaps theory. The best I can discern from reading that site is they think a mystery man pops up willy-nilly to rearrange the universe. That’s *not* Christian. That’s Islamic and pagan.

        I guess I’m an IDer. I don’t believe this all happened by accident. That said I’ve never understood why evolution, or Darwinism, or whatever, is incompatible. Why couldn’t God have created a system that evolves?

            The Catholic belief is that God is the first cause. Darwin was actually amenable to this point of view. God set the universe in motion and evolution is part of the universe he created. If you were an atheist you could replace God with space aliens from another dimension and you get the same result.
ID’ers, from what I gather, reject your point of view. They deny that complexity can arise from simplicity. That seems to be a core belief with them. So, their “god of the gaps” steps in and re-arranges the world on a constant basis.

                Figures- I am a Catholic, after all. Also I never got that separation of faith and works- what good is faith without works? I know why Luther stressed faith, due to particular corruptions within the church, but I think I’d rather live in a society that stressed works. However, while my Catholicism is somewhat cultural (that is to say I don’t feel particularly filled with the spirit of the Lord) I have come to the conclusion that, while individuals can be good without God, societies cannot. The people that tell me- “I’m a good person, I don’t have to go to church!” -well, that “good person-ness” takes place within a Christian (or Judeo-Christian) context. As our societal devotion to Biblical teaching becomes weaker, our works will become less good. Or even worse- we will farm out even more of our good works to the government.
