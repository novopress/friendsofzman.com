        I recommend that the Dorm Stormers start a website so they can swap tips.  They could call itThe Stormer.  That would be appropriate somehow.

        I’m convinced it’s a subconscious form of cultural suicide, which is absurdly common throughout history, but barely acknowledged. When a civilization no longer believes in its animating principles its behavior starts to reflect that quietly suicidal urge. Islam’s single overriding political philosophy is premised on a kind of parasitic predation, it has built itself up basically through such a multi-generational strategy of taking over weak and dying cultures. Pre-20th Century India and China were defunct as civilizations, and Islam made huge strides transplanting itself into these comatose cultures, but in the past few decades both have seen a resurgence, and the parasites are having a rough time of it. The West is a happy victim for such a parasitic death dance. It’s unlikely the West will ever rise from its slumber, as its lifeblood is sucked away.

        You have put into words what a lot think but are now too scared to say as the Liberals who orchestrated, the rich ones that is, are far away from the mayhem and don’t give a flut about the consequence of their actions, as long as they get the vote…the ‘whats in it for me ‘ vote..ignorant greedy immigrants. A virus as true as WW Z is a movie.Muslim’s went straight for the jugular when they invaded the viking netherworlds. They never in their wildest dreams thought it would be so easy to assimilate. Now to conquer!

        “….including one—“Khalid from Almere”—who can be seen on right-wing websites posing with heads he has separated from infidel bodies.”
Cites please. What makes you think a Muslim Jihadist who has more in common with Hitler and National SOCIALISM, a distinct ideology of the Left, than right-wing conservatism, has anything to do with the right? Or are you a Europeon?

        At least the Dutch, French, Danes and Brits are fighting back. It doesn’t appear that the Swedes, Spaniards, Italians and Germans are.Especially the Swedes.And the Belgians are all but toast.http://www.pi-news.org/2013/06/the-slaughter-has-begun/#more-9714
It isn’t just the insane immigration policies which will kill Europe. It’s the obsession with enforcing even more batshit crazy feminism and homosexuality barging into not only the bedrooms, but the bathrooms of every European as well.
