        Elites just seem to be programmed to make these sorts of errors, Z Man.  The Romans ran their small freeholder class off the land and imported Middle Eastern slaves to work the Latifundia.  The English ran off hard-working Scots and sent them here to build a nation.  The Germans decided to kill the Slavs and Jews instead of selling stuff to them.  The post-war Europeans have transformed their workers into a caste of trade-union gammas and epsilons, apparently having done away with the need for soma, hypnopedia, and feelies altogether.A constitutional republic was supposed to prevent precisely that kind of short-sighted, wealth accruing, non-investing (by that I mean investing in the commonwealth out of enlightened self interest) elite from forming.  Yet here we are.The good news is that unlike the examples I cited earlier, we have an outspoken segment of the public that is actively voicing opposition to the elite’s folly and who have not been silenced, yet.  The bad news is that the tools that we created to check and contain foolish, selfish elites — states rights, the amendment process, the pre-Warren Court ability of rural elites to check corrupt urban elites (see Reynolds vs Sims), Glass-Steagall… I could go on — have been gamed into irrelevance.We’ll see what the next election brings.
