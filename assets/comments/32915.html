        The fear of being exiled from their comfy surroundings to McDonalds as a fry cook, which is probably part of what bothers them about Trump, he actually puts himself in the shoes of working people, not only at McDonalds but he was known to mingle with the staff all his business life.

            So many of these rich and affluent people are living paycheck to paycheck. These are  people with 15k monthly mortgages who would literally be homeless within a couple of months if they lost their position. Seeing Trump work McDonald‚Äôs gives them existential dread it could happen to them.

        It boils down to simple choice:  You either commit to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, or you abandon ship.  The first choice provides the illusion of gradual progress, papering over the gaping holes in the hull.  The second is, to most, terrifying ‚Äì confronting the powerful reality of the world and one‚Äôs ultimate inability to effect change in almost anything other than one‚Äôs own choices.  ‚ÄúBut the lifeboats are flimsy compared to the ship.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut the water is freezing.‚Äù   ‚ÄúBut we might not make it.‚ÄùNews flash, folks:  Everything dies.  Every choice in life involves some risk or some compromise.  Most people are afraid of pitting themselves against their peers, the system, or nature itself.  And in the end, reality always wins.  Most of our ‚Äòstuff‚Äô will become trash.  Most of us will be forgotten.  But people just cannot imagine that they just aren‚Äôt that important or vital to the world.  ‚ÄúBUT every life matters!!‚ÄùNo, actually, most of us don‚Äôt ‚Äì individually.  If you are fortunate, you might leave some progeny and some memories and lessons.  And those progeny might have their own children and leave their own lessons, some remembered partly from your teaching.  ‚ÄúLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal.‚Äù‚ÄúFor where your treasure is, there willyour heart be also.‚Äù

            Bingo. You‚Äôre raising the central issue of our age and generation. We worked hard to pile up all this stuff. But the ship is sinking. The band is playing and the drinks are flowing. We should do something and we don‚Äôt. I know I am to blame here and it‚Äôs depressing.

                No doubt about it;  The ship is going down.  But I reckon it won‚Äôt go under until I have passed.  Why jump into that cold water?  These chairs are comfy.
As long as those Haitians in steerage stay below decks.

                Nonsense!up here in Alberta in the 80s the oil bust was in full swing. Youth unemployment was 37% here‚Ä¶ worse for us kids than it was for our grandparents in the dirty 30s. It was a really bad time for a teens like me and the girlfriend to confront an unplanned pregnancy and a shotgun wedding.Not gonna lie ‚Äì it was AWFUL. But‚Ä¶ we all got by. Families pulled together, we had to think about money and stretch it till it squealed, but it was the old nickel: hard times create good people. It also culls the bad ones. They were dark days to be sure‚Ä¶ but some of my fondest memories are from that period of my life. I had more in common with my Dirty 30s depression era grandmother than I did with my first gen Boomer parents. They had fallen upwards all their lives and a lot of them did very poorly during the oil bust. They lost their big fancy homes, their swimming pools, their flashy cars, cushy jobs and a few even committed suicide after going bankrupt.unlike my parents I learned how to save, prep, and think in the long term. I think that America almost needs a reset like this ‚Äì the cloud people certainly do! We need to relearn the value of money, re-evaluate our dreams, and repair and invest in our communities and families and focus on what is important to us. Mostly, we need to take ownership of the problems rather than leaving them to retards and grifters to deal with.I would wish we could do it under much less dire circumstances‚Ä¶ but it is what it is. Be thankful for your smarts, your family and friends. You will need them all when the time to rebuild comes.

            ‚ÄúAbandoning ship‚Äù seems to suggest expatriation, but unfortunately nothing is that simple. If one is fleeing from an impending ‚Äúcollapse,‚Äù it‚Äôs not as if the effects of a collapse of AINO would be contained to its geographical borders, or the collapse of the GAE contained to its. There would be chaos all over, both financial and physical, the latter emanating from the former. If the dollar goes belly up in any short time frame, then so does most every other currency on earth. But the good news is, I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance.

                Other nations already are abandoning (de-valuing) the dollar. The country in which I live has been tanking the dollar the past 3 years. Been going on since America signaled it wasn‚Äôt a serious country anymore (the Plandemic hysteria).

            Solzhenitsyn said it best. If, when the jackboots showed up at your door at 3:00 am to take you away, instead of acquiescing peacefully, you greeted then with a loaded shotgun; each individual would indeed have made a tangible difference. But we can do better than that ultimate sacrifice, we can arise from the shadows before the knock on the door ever occurs, and act with focus and resolve aimed at the root of the problem. And if done with crafty intelligence, live to repeat and repeat and repeat until Tyranny takes its last breath. That kind of resistance is in our DNA.

            I know it doesn‚Äôt look like it, but in reality it‚Äôs a spiritual war.  Always has been.  America is the chief battleground on the planet right now.
You want to win, you fight with spiritual weapons (beginning with Scripture) and seek to please God and ‚Äòlay up future treasures‚Äô.  Does that mean your own life will be easy and you personally will see immediate benefits?  Nupe.  That‚Äôs why faith is the key.

                Ray, since I see the world in terms of warring tribes (and my white tribe refuses to acknowledge that a war is being fought), I wonder about the role of race in the spiritual war that you describe.
Is God displeased if one race of Christians does not want Christians of another race in their lands?  Is that the prerogative of a Christian nation or should devotion to Christ be like a passport into all Christian lands?

                    Historically, it never has been. Cultural choices like religion and choice of 2nd language appear to be (not perfectly, but) highly correlated with ethnicity.Germans and French have been foraying back and forth over the Rhine for at least 2 millennium, from back when the ancestors of the French were Gauls and ‚ÄòGer-men‚Äô was the Gallic word for ‚Äòmen from over the river (Rhine)‚Äô. They fought before either were Christian. They fought when they were both Christian. Now that neither is substantively Christian ‚Ä¶ they have common enemies now, but if globalism and Islam are expelled, I expect that they will be back at it eventually. If globalism and Islam are not expelled, then they will both become extinct, footnotes in world history textbooks written in Chinese and Russian.Germans and French cannot coexist in the same polity; it is clear to even the most superficial observer. People that think it is going to work with Africans, Jews, and Muslims are howling barking mad.Universalism is dead, because it has failed to produce stable civilizations. There is no civilization that cannot be improved with Christianization, with accepting Christ‚Äôs message, but actual real-world institutional implementation within a civilization (Christianity become an embedded part of an ethnoculture) is on a case by case basis only.

Thanks for the direct talk.
I don‚Äôt find Christ‚Äôs message personally compelling, with all respect to your belief, but I would be proud to serve such a country.

I dunno for sure, I wasn‚Äôt there.I won‚Äôt presume to tell you how God ‚Äòfeels‚Äô, but I can tell you He is nationalistic and strongly opposed the inter-marriage of the Hebrew tribes with women from neighboring nations.  Obviously because of spiritual pollution, a la Solomon and his many pagan wives.  How much the ‚Äòracial‚Äô factor applied, I dunno.I am a race-realist, but also an agent of the Kingdom.  I don‚Äôt hate any race but like I said, I am realistic.Almost a decade now, I‚Äôve lived in a latin american nation.  Why?  I get treated much better here, and there are few white women to falsely accuse/imprison me.  Here I am respected and occasionally even loved.  In America, I was loathed and occasionally falsely accused of crimes.  That got old.  I left.My best friend here is a local I‚Äôve known eight years.  He drives me around and helps me to walk when I need to, bit shaky these days on my own.  He is loyal to me (will fight for me) and I am loyal to him (will fight for him).  I introduced him to God and God‚Äôs ways.  He‚Äôs got brown skin like most everybody else here, but I love him like a little brother.American multi-kulti clearly is a strategy of the devil ‚Äî a v effective strategy too.  America is an experiment for sure, but it ain‚Äôt a heavenly experiment, put it that way.  America was planned centuries before its official founding.  Its taught history is basically a lie.  The Capitol dome makes clear that George Washington was deified, and that suchlike for everybody is the occult purpose of the nation.  The fresco is called The Apotheosis of Washington, after all.  ‚ÄòHiding in plain sight‚Äô they call it.This was the Fifties, early Sixties ‚Äî as a kid I was Catholic, because my dad was (Irish) Catholic.  We had Filipinos and blacks in the church, though a distinct minority.  Filipinos especially made good Christians, and good neighbors too.  No I dunno why.Once a month after church, the Holy Name Society had a big (scrumptious!) breakfast in the cafeteria.  About 200 men attended, I estimate.  My brother and I were the only children allowed to attend.  I didn‚Äôt know why back then but have an idea now.  P.S. no women either.The Irish priest gave a talk and then we sang the (Irish)  ‚ÄòHarrigan‚Äô song, lustily.  ‚ÄòProud of all the Irish blood that‚Äôs in me‚Äô went one line.  Nobody filed any protests or lawsuits.It was all men ‚Äî I don‚Äôt recall any non-white H.N.S. members though I could be misremembering.  If so, they were few.  The women made breakfast until one year when, as the satanic culture progressed, they refused. Early Uppity stage of Great Progress. So the men shrugged and started making it themselves.  Dayum it was good, and all I really cared about, in truth.It was a working class, Navy-shipyard town.  Mostly white but with about a 20 percent black population, segregated into distinct neighborhoods, and a small scattering of other races.  In about 1964 the town built two separate subdivisions of tract homes, one populated by whites (including my family) and the other by blacks.  The white subdivision was well-kept, with only a couple scraggly properties.  The black subdivision was mixed ‚Äî some well-kept homes, and some wrecks with tall weeds in the yard.After MLK got offed, the town went nuts for awhile, they had to shut down my high school for a couple weeks due to black rioting and violence.  When it opened back up, the cops patrolled the corridors for a couple weeks.  My buddies from Kentucky stayed outta school for a month, their parents refused to let them attend.  That was back before the GAE became a full-on empire and demonic D.C. ruled everybody‚Äôs lives.Is that enogh amigo?  Let me know if that doesn‚Äôt answer your question or if you need me to be more specific.

Spectacular. As usual the comments are as good as the original poast!

I know it‚Äôs much easier said than done‚Ä¶ but cleaning house in Washington and Ottawa is all it would take to get things back on track.
The American people have a choice ‚Äì get guys like Trump and Elon to fix it ‚Äì or Darwin and Murphy will.

                The number one attribute required to change things is willpower. Hitler recognized this early on in  his career. His problem was that, once he made a decision, he resolved to stick with it no matter what. He would think deeply on an issue, see it from all sides ‚Äî then commit. This led to disaster on the Eastern Front. Once he was embroiled in conflict against the Russians, he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to withdraw his forces to Fortress Germany.Willpower ‚Äî linked with flexibility ‚Äî is the way to go, I think. Make up your mind but be prepared to change it with fluctuating conditions.‚Äî Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

        That‚Äôs one huge structural advantage the Left has always had ‚Äî they‚Äôre sneaky bastards. Meaning, they attract the kind of people who are willing to go deep cover in an institution ‚Äî their ideology actually valorizes eating as many buckets of crap as you need to in order to maintain your cover (come The Revolution, comrade, you shall have your reward, which is your revenge). The Right (for rhetorical convenience) doesn‚Äôt have too many of that kind of person, if any ‚Äî you have to somehowenjoythe degradation of being a sneak in order to do it well. If we had a few of those, we could stage our own ‚Äúlong march through the institutions.‚Äù But alas‚Ä¶. I guess.

            Great comment. Having lived around political people from both sides in DC back in the day, I couldn‚Äôt agree more. The liberal whites (which included a fair amount of Jews) saw this a battle to the death and were willing to dedicate their lives to the cause.
The people on the right saw it as a debate.
There was no contest or doubt on who would win.

                Even if it was a debate, we would still lose.  It would be like a communist and a capitalist ‚Äúdebating‚Äù in front of an audience made up of communists.  The capitalist cannot win.The ‚Äúleft‚Äù doesn‚Äôt win arguments because they have the better arguments and facts. They win because their views have been propagandized to people all of their lives starting when they were a toddler.As soon as the communist audience recognize even a subtle hint of capitalism in the arguments, his conditioning kicks in.  He doesn‚Äôt think you are wrong, he thinks you are evil and want to kill him.  His reasoning shuts down. He responds entirely emotionally to every word you say.

                    The Right has no clue what game is being played or how hard the other side will play to win. It‚Äôs only the Right‚Äôs own weakness that keeps them around.

                        CoaSC. Good day to you.What we call ‚ÄúThe Right‚Äù, is not in any way right. The entirety of all political actors, that is people within positions of power and influence who can move power in some direction, are Leftist. They buy in to the entire project of progress. History is linear. You are either moving forward or backward. Its measures translate to this central tenant. The line on the economic metric is going up or down. If it is going up, progress is being made. If it is going down, there is the anti-Christ! Regression!This is the real God they worship. It is progress. Of course, they defined progress at the beginning and never questioned if it was a worthy goal, attainable or if it constituted some good. When their failings can‚Äôt be denied they begin at Year Zero. Year Zero becomes an ever more occurent event. You know you have hit failure and failure in the ability to answer is it good and who is it good for when you hear: ‚ÄúHitler!‚Äù, ‚ÄúWoke!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhite Supremacy!‚Äù ‚ÄúRacist!‚Äù ‚ÄúSexist!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou Hate the Poor!‚Äù ‚ÄúNazi!‚Äù and on and on and on with the list you know.Musk, Thiel and the other guys are also in this boat. Their view of progress is just more narrow. Is there new technology that makes money and that creates ‚Äúefficiency?‚Äù Yes? Well then that is progress and that and that alone will make everything good.The system is Anti-White because we seem to be best able to think long term and say, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt good.‚Äù Also, we are the frog who has been put in progress‚Äô pot. So, we are experiencing the failures and the evil of them doubling down again and again and again.Anyway, not to ramble, but as Nixon said, ‚ÄúWe are all Keynsian now.‚Äù Whether they know it or not, Rufo, and all of the rest have effectively said, ‚ÄúWe are all Progressives now.‚ÄùWishing you a good day and wishing you well in constructive and creative energy and action toward steeling yourself and your family from the ongoing failings of the machinery of Progress.

            Sure, there‚Äôs some subterfuge on the Left, but even more important is naivete on the Right. For instance, academia in the 70s was composed mainly of ordinary liberals along with a considerable leavening of Buckleyite conservatives. Both of those groups, albeit somewhat contemptible in their own ways, did at least believe in honor, fair play, open debate, and intellectual pluralism.Enter the New Left, which came of age 1962 through 1969, and began pursuing academic positions ca. 1970. New Leftists were nothing like liberals, let alone conservatives. They didn‚Äôt merely want a seat at the table, they wanted to smash the table and expel everybody who had been sitting at it. These people were true revolutionaries, not folks who wanted to work within the existing system.Unfortunately, the old guard failed to recognize the pulsating evil in the hearts of these young vipers. They just assumed the New Leftists were basically like them, albeit espousing many rather bizarre viewpoints. And so they welcomed them into the fold. Only too late did they realize their mistake. And by that time the New Left was so strong that nothing could stop it from completely conquering the social sciences/humanities, which it did by the end of the 80s.So, were some of the New Leftists moles who bit their tongues and bided their time until the witching hour? I suppose. But if liberals and conservatives hadn‚Äôt been so bloody blind to the true nature of the New Left, we would be living in a very different country right now.

                Ostei:  The ‚Äòvictory‚Äô of the New Leftists exposed not simply the naivete of the libs and cucks of the time.  It exposed the basic weakness and lies that were foundational to the system itself:  Egalitarianism and globalism.  Oh, I know what Washington warned about, and that many of the Founders were deists, but underlying it all was the fallacy of ‚Äòmankind‚Äô and the misinterpretation of Scripture to believe that sharing one putative faith meant sharing one land and civilization and values.  African and Asian Christianity is not the same as European Christianity.  The Tower of Babel was destroyed for a reason.  That is why the dissident right does not and ought not seek to rebuild but to begin anew, based on the truth.

        The donors and, occasionally, the darker agents of the donor/Deep State organizations are the key. They decide who is allowed into the managerial class and itscommentariat. They decide the boundaries, the rewards and the punishment.
Rufo throwing Brunet under the bus is an example. Steve Sailer being allowed out of the shadows in the wake of Oct. 7 is another. There is no right. There are just donors and various organizations controlling the what the rubes think is the Right and Left.

                Exactly. The Age of Ideology has given way to the Age of Demographics but whites are mentally still stuck in the former.A white rube thinks that Rufo crushing Harvard‚Äôs Gay or Sailer being allowed to be interviewed is a victory for their ideology over the ideology of identity politics. They‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs just that Jews decided that they needed to inject some colorblind civic nationalism into the system since identity politics was starting to look bad for them.Presumably, other groups, like the Indians, will start pushing various ideas that benefit them, but those ideas can change on a dime as their group‚Äôs interests change.Whites can‚Äôt even think like this, much less join the game. Pathetic.

                As a last ditch, modified limited hangout, after the Trump Restoration (if it occurs) Con Inc may let us speak somewhat more honestly about the problems of blacks (other nons less so), although I suspect they will draw the line at genetics.
The ultimate taboo, of course, the one the got Brunet axed, will still be taboo, maybe even more so.

                    Jews always have to walk a fine line. Promote multi-everythingism but not allowing whites to join the party. They also pretend to be white (to whites but not to non-whites) while having endless Jewish organizations and lobbies.As whites become a minority, this will become harder. You can already see that happening. Oct. 7 pushed the Jewish elite to back off the identity politics as Jews were singled out by non-whites, something they hate more than anything.Naturally, the Jewish response was over the top. Subtle, they are not. They‚Äôre having a harder time keeping their non-white pets in order, which should be a surprise to no one. But they‚Äôll never be willing to join Team Whitey, so what to do?For now, keep the plates spinning, but it‚Äôs getting harder and harder. Non-whites view Jews as either whites or, gasp, Jews. But even some whites are starting to notice Jewish influence. It‚Äôs still a very small % of whites, but the fact that people now openly talk about the Israeli lobby isn‚Äôt a good sign for Jews.It‚Äôs why they need to crack down so hard on people like Brunet, but the day will come when a Brunet type will find a home someplace else, or, more likely, an Indian will call out Jewish influence and since the Indian will be a part of a different managerial class ‚Äì the Indian community ‚Äì the Jews won‚Äôt be able to cancel him.The 20th Century ‚Äì the Jewish Century ‚Äì is coming to a close.

                        I agree that long term, Israeli influence is waning. To the extent that it is tied to Israeli interests, so is Jewish influence generally. Even Ben Shapiro admits as much.Somewhat ironically, a Trump restoration (probably) would temporarily arrest that decline. Trump 2 would presumably give Israel free rein to pursue regime change war with Iran. Israel hopes that victory would make it a regional hegemon that could dictate the terms of a general peace to its neighbors.With Israel secure, and no longer as dependent on American support, diaspora Jews could then focus on their common interest with the ascendant nons: flooding the West with  more nons, and in the process securing their own position as first among equals in majority minority states.It may not work out that way, but that‚Äôs the plan.

                            Yes. Yes. This. Betrayal is their name.Cyrus of Persia destroyed their benefactors in New Babylon, who had given them a position in the capital itself.Cyrus himself was memorialized as the Redeemer for whom they waited, the King returned, the Messiah motif that the Christians adopted.Thus, they are driven to try to betray Persia to loud uluations of adoration, and replace her as hegemon with themselves.This their agents in the State Department did with the good and great Shah, once he sought to break away from Semitic Arab dominance and reexert historic Persian sway. The Shah was their only friend in the Middle East.They succeeded in the biggest way when Islam cast its net over Persia; remember, the Four Righteous Caliphs of Islam were Arab generals who overthrew their Persian lord after the victories of the Conquest. Islam was the Semitic Reformation of evangelical Judaism.They seek now to renew and extend that victory, that gave them a reign of 700 years over the white lands.Their Muslim and nonwhite shabbos troops are in our lands- by betrayal and pretext- and being taught to riot unopposed.They betrayed both Britain and Germany for giving them Israel. Now, America and Europe are the final betrayal to complete to give them the world, under the Temple authority of the United Nations, the Tower they built. Persia will be the sign.Betrayal is their Way. It has been thus since the beginning, when Abraham the Lucifer tried to overthrow his lawful Lord that raised him up to be the right-hand man.

                    The ultimate taboo will be more protected, of course, but it will be really hard to maintain in place over the long haul.

Granted, I don‚Äôt follow that BS very closely any longer and it could be as bad as ever, but what little I sample is bereft of the usual nonstop platitudes.

            America as we knew it saw the arrival of Irish in the 1850s with their big-city corruption. The rest of the country, from Main Street to rural America, carried on with politics as usual. The Italians and Jews near the end of the century brought organized crime and social subversion; but the WASP elite hung on through much of the 20th century. The assimilation of these groups brought us to the point of our politics today. With a majority of American school-age children now non-white, what will our future polity look like? I‚Äôd say Brazil if we‚Äôre lucky, South Africa if we‚Äôre not. There can be no great reawakening because the people have changed beyond recognition. What sort of system, for instance, would appeal to sub-continental Indians? Even the greatLatin Americaliberators came to despair of forming great nations out of their ragtagmestizomasses. We must focus on our own community. If we come through this with a functioning state, so much the better.

        The irony is that as the fighting ramps up, the scope for corrective action decreases dramatically. If Trump‚Äôs first term proved anything, it was this. The debt is just massive and nobody seriously proposes to do anything about it. Trump might tone down foreign policy and fire a few bureaucrats, assuming the crooked Federal judges let him, but that‚Äôs about it. Like the Whigs of old, the new Right is largely fighting a rear-guard battle with the massive forces of Government grown out of control. On the social front, we have a generation of women (and weak men) who are basically out of control. In both cases, it will take a crisis to forge a new Right. Inside-the-Beltway tinkering (like Rufo/Brunet) is just a sideshow to the coming main event.

        ‚ÄúEven the money men find themselves constrained by a system that they supposedly control.‚ÄùThis points to the differences between ‚Äòpower‚Äô and ‚Äòauthority‚Äô and ‚Äòlegitimacy‚Äô. Power, in a political rather than engineering context, is the ability to get other people to do what you want when they would not do so without your exercise of it. It comes in two varieties, persuasion and coercion.Authority is comprised of those organizations (organized groups of people) which provide behavioral instruction and enforcement of standards. Examples include legislatures, police, army and your state Department of Motor Vehicles. The degree of willingness with which the instruction is received is a function of the legitimacy of authority perceived by the ruled.A country with a genuine democratic system where the direction of authority is responsive to the will of the people (of the people, by the people, for the people) can be said have overlap (think Venn diagram) in authority and power. Individuals, elected by the people reflecting their aspirations, are exercising power on behalf of the people through the institutions of authority, which in turn are then perceived as legitimate by the ruled.Such a system does not exist in the broken West. We have neoliberal democracy, the defining feature of which is a complete decoupling of and separation between power and authority. The individuals in institutions of authority (think Congress/President/Supreme Court) are not exercising power on behalf of the people, but are having power exercised upon them (coercion [political police/assassination] and persuasion [bribery]) by those with power who are not inside theinstitutions of authority. The American manifestation is rule by the donor class (oligarchy), which is comprised of those who own the manufacture or instantiation of fiat currency and the much larger group who are allowed by the owners to feed upon the rivers of new money as it is injected into the economic system.Neoliberal democracy results in the oligarchy always getting what they want by controlling (exercising power over) the institutions of authority. The great American writer Frank Herbert once said, through a character in his bookDune, ‚ÄúControl the coinage and the courts. Let the rabble have the rest.‚Äù The oligarchy who rules America has traditionally been content to control the design and management of the large-scale structure of civilization. They left the small stuff to be managed locally to maintain the illusion, the fa√ßade, of democracy so that the ruled would continue to view as legitimate the institutions of authority.However, the ideological, cultural, and demographic fracturing of America (in a word:diversity) has led to the oligarchy‚Äôs overreliance on minions within the institutions of authority (the lunatic white left, and others) who are emotionally unable to leave the ruled with enough local autonomy to maintain perceptions of legitimacy among the ruled. They want to control EVERTHING.A recent example of how the system works, and the limits of control by money, is the fuss over anti-Semitic? African leadership at Harvard and the other Ivy‚Äôs. Jews provide much or most of the endowment funding, as they do for both of the corporations that we call the Democratic and Republican Parties, and hence reasonably expect institutional compliance with their interests. The late Democratic pundit from Texas Molly Ivins used to say ‚Äúya dance with them who brung ya.‚ÄùBarely literate Africans being paid staggering amounts of (Jewish) money were not behaving according to script. Students (the next generation of the administrative class) were siding with the melaninated exemplar of their future utopia instead of the people who were paying all of them and enabling their privileged lifestyles. Financial threats being the scenes ensued, resulting in removal of the African icons from leadership positions.This was a tactical victory resulting in reestablishment of formal control over the indoctrination institution that we call an Ivy League university. It was also a strategic defeat, because it came with a cost. Anti-Semitism is now cemented as a defining feature of the young left. Money Jews stood between the stampeding herd and the direction in which they wanted to go and were recognized as such. Persuasion is no longer a tool in toolkit of Jewish power. It‚Äôs all on coercion now, for as long as it lasts.

        Unless it adopts fascism, conservatism cannot ever again become relevant because Leviathan exists.Antebellum ‚Äúconservatism‚Äù meant prudence, self-reliance, a work ethic, fiscal discipline, and refraining from interfering in foreign affairs. Christianity was the main institution for transmitting what were essentially the Platonic virtues through the Protestant Ethic. The government was not going to come and save you from yourrself.It had no power to do so.  If you were a homeless drunk and a failure, it was up to Christians to preach the virtues of temperance to you, because the government was not going to pay for you to go to rehab while you were on disability living in a Sec. 8 apartment.The Civil War created the conditions in which the federal government could become Leviathan, and the 16th Amendment provided the funding. Only 20 years after the income tax, we got the New Deal, the permanent bureaucracy, the permanent welfare state, and the military-industrial complex.No conservative has ever been able to repeal, refute, or replace any of that, because it is popular with the public. Politicians love it because they can buy votes with it. Thirty years after the New Deal, the welfare state and the ‚Äúcivil rights‚Äù bureaucracy threw the power and money of the federal government behind the Sexual Revolution and hedonism. Consequently GAE/ZOG has become a perpetual cultural revolutionary state ‚Äî once gay marriage becomes pass√©, we get transgenderism and Drag Queen Story Hour. And on and on and on.The only way for conservatives to become relevant against is not to pine for the antebellum days of Jeffersonian limited government or even the Articles of Confederation, but to embrace the federal bureaucracy, seize control of the institutions, and purge their cultural and ideological opponents.

                Pretty much.Conservatives need to acknowledge that the Leviathan state is not going away and we‚Äôre not returning to Jefferson‚Äôs agricultural frontier yeomanry, however we might wish we could.Someone is going to control the state and the bureaucracy and the military and the organs of propaganda. It is either going to be us, or them. Franco understood that the Spanish Republicans were going to use the state to destroy traditional Spanish culture and religion and kill the conservatives. There could be no compromise. The National Socialists understood that if the KPD won the elections and took control of the state, the KPD would ban the NSDAP and arrest and execute its leaders. So NSDAP beat them to it.Well, we are not going to vote out way out of this. Trump won in 2016 ‚Äî so they impeached him, arrested him, arrested his lawyer and violated his attorney-client privilege, arrested his chief of staff, arrested his national security adviser, arrested his political advisers, tried to bankrupt him and destroy his business, and used the FBI and MI6 to plant false narratives about how he was a stooge of Putin and Russian prostitutes gave him golden showers.At this moment he is unsentenced convict on state charges and remains under federal indictment.Oh, I almost forgot, they tried to shoot him twice and tried to assassinate the entire Republican congressional leadership in 2017.How many Democrats have the Republicans arrested or shot when they were in power?Crickets.And ‚Äúconservative‚Äù retards still think Trump is ‚Äúgonna win, baby‚Äù and make America great again?Come on.

        Zman:Our chattering classes are like the courtiers who live their lives walled up inside the king‚Äôs palace, talking amongst themselves. Everyone they know thinks the same things, says the same things and cares about the same things.Restating the obvious, borrowing someone else‚Äôs words, recalled imperfectly:¬†Russia in the early 20th century was surely one of the major world power. Yet within just a few years the old Czarist regime would fall to the Bolsheviks, ushering in major changes, including tens of millions of citizens‚Äô deaths, even ignoring wartime.The salient point here is that the Imperial Court and probably much of the Apparat to boot, effectively lived in their own little worlds until the very end. The royal family was deliberately kept ignorant of the goings-on and lived lives of blissful ignorance until their final minutes of life.The lesson, of course is simply that our ruling classes, certainly the Inner Party but also most of the Outer as well is about as divorced from the reality (realities?) of the Proles as it is possible to be.

            Just today I heard an outer Party guy, standard GOP libertarian with some right inflection‚Äîhe‚Äôs against gay guys getting tax credits for the orphans they adopt to make snuff films of, or whatever‚Äîsay that the Bolsheviks were motivated byenvy. Everything that happened after the apocryphal story of the revolutionary‚Äôs wife trying on the royal jewels was incidental. That moment said it all: Welfare queens!People who know the story know that bankers/etc. and Germany/etc. sent Lenin to conquer Russia‚Äîblah blah blah. We know the story. It‚Äôs not a secret. But it doesn‚Äôt fit any standard ‚Äútake‚Äù on the event. No problem!There‚Äôs a standard-issue propaganda painting that comes with every communist revolution: The almost-defeated-looking rustic soldier (local ethnicity) stands in the white palace, ceilings so high they‚Äôre like open skies, paralyzed with awe (nearly dropping his rifle) at the extent of the wealth kept from the people‚Äîthe peculiarwasteof royalty, both ostentatious and hidden, palaces‚Äô mockery of heaven, etc.The inner party paints, and the outer party believes. The painting mocks its subject. The soldier is representative: ‚ÄúThere you are, little guy! We‚Äôre in! I mean,you‚Äôrein! It‚Äôsyou, tough guy!‚Äù The righttotally buys itand hates as it‚Äôs told‚Äînot the banker but the trespasser (imaginary).

        Nothing changes until the environment changes. Real change in politics can only occur after a societal collapse forces the sheeple into panic and desperation. Persuasion and volition matter not, only existential drivers like starvation or lethal threat can instigate fundamental change. We are better off pushing for collapse than innovating magic incantations to move the masses. Russia rebounded as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union, not because Putin was a magic leader. Slow death abets misery.

        Is an official, organized commentariat all that influential in the Digital Age? If everyone can be part of the commentariat, what existed previously is at best archaic. While I loathe internet influencing as a thing, it undeniably persuades more than Regime media at this point and this has been the case for some time, particularly with those under 65. The system you accurately describe is a thing, but it really is a second banana to other sources of information as far as public impact. Christopher Rufo would have the same reach tomorrow if he were expelled from the Manhattan Institute although obviously he would have less money in his pocket.As a marketing expert who comments here has pointed out, advertising now is formulated to please the board of directors rather than to sell widgets, hence every couple featured in spots is either gay or mixed race. The official commentariat obviously serves the same function, with persuasion way down the list of objectives. But at some point, Con, Inc., will be cut off due to its irrelevance. Advertising budgets always are the first thing cut when things get financially rough.

            Bingo. Part of the Elites‚Äô hatred of Rufo (and the other young influencers), Rogan, Tucker is that their ascendance has broken the Lollipop Guild of the Elite Commentariat. There‚Äôs nobody under 55 going to Manhattan Institute events. My buddy goes and invites me sometimes. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass him by flirting with Heather MacDonald the whole time lol.

        I have a couple of family members who keep sending me Heather Cox Richardson substack pieces.  They want to convince me that she‚Äôs the voice of reason, while I think she‚Äôs speaking an alien language.From what I‚Äôve read, her worldview seems to be Beltway-centric, seen through the Dem-Repub prism.  This or that Republican needs to be opposed, Trump is bad, Zelensky is a brave hero, etc‚Ä¶.My eyes glaze over.She and her comment section fully support the system, and in fact it never enters their minds that the system is broken.  Things like the Civil Rights Act and race are settled issues.  To them the extremists are Trump, Vance, and Elon Musk, and defeating those like them is the answer.

        One of the things conservatives keep failing to notice is that the liberals have collapsed too. They can no longer balance a check book, think critically, or plan for the future. It‚Äôs getting so bad that guys inside the club are starting to go into rebellion. Trump, Elon and other Cloud people know that the wheels are coming off and that which can‚Äôt go on‚Ä¶won‚Äôt! Even in Hollywood ‚Äì that bastion of liberal faggotry and depravity‚Ä¶are starting to crack. Stallone and others are now openly critiquing the regime, and websites like Rotten Tomatoes, The Critical Drinker and others tell the true story. There are more pedos and child molestors running Disney than there are in the Vatican. Even the blacks are in arms, watching their gibs threatened by imported 3rd world trash. Unless they kill him‚Ä¶Trump is going to win the next election. If the Donks cheat and inflict Kamala on the people‚Ä¶they‚Äôre going to have to start dodging bullets from ‚Äúlone crazies‚Äù too. Something is going to give soon and everyone knows it.The current regime is suicidal and mentally ill. You can‚Äôt run a country like this indefinitely and when the dam breaks‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all over.

            Critical Drinker and company are correct to skewer the garbage being foisted on the masses as pop culture.
However, they consistently seem to miss the larger point that the destruction of existing popular franchises and the addition of new woke franchises is the entire point. The financial losses are a feature, not a bug to ideological lunatics.

        What this fails to understand is that heterodox views are anesthetized by the larger culture, the education system and the press.  They are presented as highly immoral and worthy of scorn and disgust.  Only evil people who want to do really evil things would think such horrible and forbidden thoughts let alone try to communicate them to others.  We may as well be nambla.

                When we were young enough to be interesting to them, NAMBLA was a fully embraced, open partner in the perv coalition. Image-minded homos reformed it‚Äîmoving the ‚ÄúL‚Äù to the front, hiding the real leather men and showcasing effeminate TV gays, etc.‚Äîto make it less frightening to women, less sexed. ‚Äô70s gay politics wasdicks out. They put most of that away, for the ladies‚Ä¶because they don‚Äôt understand the ladies.The blackest ‚Äúred pill‚Äù guys are right. It‚Äôs mothers who troon their boys out. There are hundreds of times as manygroupiesfor child rapists as child rapists. Women want children destroyed, preferably their own children, but they‚Äôll acceptany. Gayness has never been more popular than it is now‚Äîwith its literal knives out, swinging them at kids.That‚Äôswhyit finally made it. The ‚Äúmovement‚Äù going full tranny‚Äîfull-on psycho, fully consumed with sex asbrutality‚Äîis the most successful rebranding in political history.

        Two of the social credit systems that exist in post-America. What is interesting about the Con Inc. system is its irony. Con Inc.‚Äôs entire world view is about creating/maintaining systems that have the proper economic incentives. You set up private capital and private enterprise and you get optimum outcomes they say.Well, looks like the advocates are living in that system and the outcome is a disaster on a scale that is unprecedented in human history. Greg Hood puts this most succinctly when saying that status, not money, is the primary motivator for human beings.After all, in a Merchant Run Order, your money is tied to your status and your status to your money.

            Your score was already at ‚Äì2 when I looked. Overall I agree with your comments, in fact find no fault with them other than the first sentence being a fragment. It‚Äôs beyond me why you got downvoted. I would hazard that a Ziobot saw the term ‚ÄúMerchant‚Äù and assumed an unflattering reference to The Tribe thus the thumbs down.Con. Inc‚Äôs (indeed, virtually any entity‚Äôs) world-view prioritzes assuring basic survival motives: to survive, to reproduce, to expand territory (gain power and resources) as well as more ‚Äúsocial‚Äù traits such as in-group cooperation (call it prestige, influence, acceptance) guard territory and resources and to defend against enemies or competitors, real or imagined. An impartial outside observer might note that a large portion, perhaps the majority, of such an entity‚Äôs energy and resources are devoted to these ends. An entity may at times work towards a stated goal, perhaps even succeeding, but it‚Äôs likely that such efforts are the minority use of its resources.I agree with the Greg Hood statement. We can assume it‚Äôs generally true if one considers that tribes of human beings have existed for far longer than the concept of ‚Äúmoney.‚Äù Your ‚Äústatus,‚Äù even if that was accepting a submissive role, was a life-or-death matter.Now, I agree that with proper economic incentives one will often obtain optimum outcomes. The weakness with that statement is that, beyond the problems of defining terms, is simply that the main metric appears to be money (or similar terms like wealth, etc.) It totally ignores the possibility that other metrics of a desirable outcome might be more desirable, and ones that cannot be measured in dollars and cents, or perhaps not measurable objectively at all.

        I think we‚Äôll see people choosing Option C: complete disengagement from the system.  You can‚Äôt fix it.  You can‚Äôt get rid of it.  So you put it on blocks and park it out behind the garage to rust into oblivion.The election in a couple of weeks is the last gasp.  I think we‚Äôll see a lot of people on our side give it one more try.But at the end of the day, the entire system Z describes is the status quo.  Any result in 2 weeks other than the status quo is very bad for the current system.  That‚Äôs why the enemy has gone completely bonkers trying to intimidate people into going along with 2020‚Äôs fake election.  It is imperative to THE SYSTEM that people go along with  pretending it‚Äôs 1964 or 1976 or 1992 again.Because if we don‚Äôt, their legitimacy goes out the window like a bad teacher or coach that loses the classroom or locker room.  They just get ignored and people just do whatever they want until the classroom or team collapses.  People just stop listening, and then they start mocking, and then they start defying.The band Rush has a great line in the song Freewill, ‚ÄúIf you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.‚ÄùImagine an election with 30% turnout because everyone knows elections are a stupid joke.  Then extrapolate what comes next.Our entire society is based on what is essentially a gentlemen‚Äôs agreement to go along with a set of rules.  In traffic, in business, etc.  What happens when it‚Äôs just every man for himself, and what happens to the snobs in the ruling class whose entire existence is built upon rules that everyone now ignores?

        Getting out ‚Äì expatriating ‚Äì isn‚Äôt a bad idea in my view.  But I know folks with family here perhaps can‚Äôt.  Fortunately there are ways to get your tax-advantaged saving out of the US, so some of us will have that option and may make it regardless of what happens here if adequate care is taken.Anyway, the Cons can try all they want, but in what way will a ‚ÄúNew Right‚Äù, however constituted, be useful to whites?  It‚Äôll just be another diversion of thought and effort and resources better spent elsewhere.  Demographics can‚Äôt be denied.Better to spend time/thought/etc building up an effective separatist resistance that strives to be outside the system.  This must contain a militant force within it, or be crushed.  Only a small percentage of blacks and muslims are capable of organized violence, but that‚Äôs enough to make the system back off.  Whites could be far more effective fighters if pushed too far, but you need a support structure.  As the Progs/Left/Elite/whatever-they-are steal all the wealth and brutalize everyone‚Äôs minds with full spectrum propaganda the usual ‚Äòpolitics‚Äô becomes worse than useless.The work pepple are doing to build parallel, socially engineered communities is the right first step in my opinion.  Get the kids out of public schools.  Get the wives out of toxic social circles.  Take what you can extract from the current system, and give back as little as you can.  It hates you and is evil.  Starve the Beast.

        ‚ÄúThe Buckley people did not have much of an ‚Äúold right‚Äù to worry about, as it had collapsed in the FDR years,‚Ä¶‚Äù
No, there was the John Birch Society in the 1950‚Äôs.  OK, you might say the  Birch Society was the new Dissident Right for that era.
The long time hearsay is that the CIA backed Buckley‚Äôs magazine launch in 1955 ( or 56?) to start a ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù conservatism to counter the Birchers. William Burnham was the CIA‚Äôs man at *National Review.*
Wm. F. Buckley, by the way, was a homosexual‚Ä¶ Sort of the Lindsay Graham of the 1950‚Äôs-60‚Äôs.

        The Left/Progs/Establishment are fond of imagining that they are ‚Äòon the side of the angels‚Äô and ‚Äòon the right side of history‚Äô.  But from the true Christian perspective, the Left is satanic.  Profitably satanic, to be sure . . . but satanic.  ‚ÄòTwas always thus with the Left Hand Path.Celebrational homosexuality, open borders, globalism, feminism, transgenderism, and the Progressive Lie that undergirds all current institutions (bi-partisan government, media, corporations, courts/law, education, churches) are openly demonic from the Christian perspective.You need something new, something really reformative, you start from the foundation.  The foundation is the ‚Äòmandate of heaven‚Äô or, simply, getting God (and thus His servants) on your side.  You get God on your side by being on God‚Äôs side, i.e., advocating and maintaining culture that follows general Biblical principles.  Not Old Testament law.  General Scriptural principles.  It‚Äôs doable: America at the popular (but not elite) level largely was this way when I was young, back in the late Paleolithic.  :O)This includes shunning of homosexuality, nationalism, anti-feminism or tranditional sex roles, closed and tightly controlled borders, and traditionalism as opposed to progressivism.  In short, you invite God back in to a nation and a culture that, currently, He has abandoned.Of course, most public persons currently using Christianity as a front for cash and cult-celebrity will be dis-included ‚Äî with extreme prejudice ‚Äî from your movement.  You don‚Äôt start the loaf with tainted dough.This is how to begin.  If you have a satanic culture and nation ‚Äî and you do ‚Äî you choose the opposite and make it your fundament.  The remnant  still exists, scattered around the nation (for reasons of security).  They are around if you really want to start anew.  cheers

        Power structures in different societies are always topologically similar. It‚Äôs the names of the elite that change. In feudal times it was the nobility, in the USSR it was called member of the communist party, in Nazi Germany member of the Nazi Party, today it is being part of the elite.But everything is not constant. Sometimes state power is absolute. But we‚Äôre in an age,much like feudalism, where genuinely powerful centers are emerging, from religious and ethnic groups to outright terrorist groups to extremely wealthy companies like Black Rock to groups like the WEF to individuals like musk or bill Gates. Added to this hidden state power lodged in bureaucracy. Damn confusing landscape

        All the apostles denied Christ after he died.
It took a resurrection to light the fire under their arses to go out and change the world by suffering.
Trump may get his 2nd term, but there‚Äôs some chance that after he‚Äôs hounded out of office, persecuted, and possibly worse, what‚Äôs left of the ‚Äútrue right‚Äù (or whatever it‚Äôs called) might grown a pair and realize ‚Äúwe‚Äôre next.‚Äù
But I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath. Trump isn‚Äôt xist, his ‚Äúresurrection‚Äù is in a getting reelected form, and he‚Äôs not going to ascend into heaven.
