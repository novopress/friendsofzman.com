        “How the bureaucracy transitioned from instrument of the ruling elite into a ruling elite itself has remained a bit of mystery, with only some stabs here and there at an explanation.”There’s no mystery here. Although it’s a big hurdle to get new laws passed, it’s an even bigger hurdle to get bad laws repealed. Bad laws like the creation of administrative agencies. Then political appointees get installed to run those agencies and start pushing the boundaries of laws rubber stamp by compliant judges.I remember back in the day when they passed a long-term care tax and seniors revolted. I remember one particular scene on the nightly news where seniors were chasing after Rep. Dan Rostenkowski because they were so mad about the tax. They got it repealed because Congress actually answered to the people in those days.Nowadays they don’t answer to us. 14 years of obamacare, people hate it and it still hasn’t been repealed. Immigration, same. Funding the war in Ukraine, same. They just do what they want without regard to anybody except the billionaires that fund them.

                The problem is—aside from Congressional cowardliness—that the President has little control over the overwhelming workforce in these agencies.  Little by little, the workers have been pulled out of direct employment reporting to civil service protection.  So the leadership can be replaced and some patronage positions established, but most of the managerial worker bees cannot be touched.  Additionally, Court decisions have restricted the president’s authority to hold back funding from these agencies and thus defacto elimination of the entity.
There were pluses and minuses in these changes, we are now living through the minuses.

                        CompSci: “most of the managerial worker bees cannot be touched”Ostei Kozelskii: “All the worst people are tenured…“One cannot understand this phenomenon of “Managerialism” without first acknowledging the Hive Mind of Passive Aggression which propels the managerial phenomenon.If humanity is to survive [the prospects for which being very iffy at the moment***], then the Active Aggressives will have to rise up and eradicate the Passive Aggressives.This constant ebb and flow between Passive Aggressive dominance versus Active Aggressive dominance defines the entirety of known human history.And we’re getting way past due for an high-quality first-rate Active Aggressive uprising on the part of the peasants with torches &amp; scythes &amp; pitchforks.PRO-TIP: You cannot annihilate the Sanhedrin of Passive Aggression until you first annihilate their Praetorian Guard [Dee Oh Jay, Eff Bee Eye, Sea Eye Aaa, You Ess Imm Ess, Local Pea Dees, Moe-Sahd, etc etc etc].Annihilating their Praetorian Guard is the key to victory.====================***What could possibly be more satanically Passive Aggressive than a pediatrician inoculating a child with an MRNA v@xxine designed specifically &amp; intentionally to sterilize the child?

                        Waay back when the Federal government was much smaller, the incoming party fire everyone and hired a new crew.  This caused disruption and was known as the spoils system.  Somewhere there needed to be a happy compromise.  So civil service protections were implemented starting at lower level employees and the “automatic” turnover of staff reduced.  The exact details are not needed here to illustrate the problem at that time with firing the old crew and changing in a new crew and the learning curve such entailed.

                    Arguably Trump’s biggest structural mistake, upon taking orifice in January 2017, was in failing to sack,immediately,all of the Obama generals in the Pentagon.In retrospect, I don’t know that Trump had the correct personalititty for the sort sociological oncological surgery needed to weed out all of the metastasizing tumors in FedGov.Trump won the 2016 election via an highly emotional campaign, but emotion isn’t worth a d@mn when facing off against the myriad Passive Aggressivemetastasesin FedGov.To excise all of the metastases will require d@mned near infinite patience &amp; determination &amp; autistic spergtardery, but to my mind, that doesn’t jibe with what we know of Trump’s personalititty.If, by some miracle, Trump were to sneak back into the White House in January 2025, then to do us any good, his administration would need to give us an whole lot less of Robin Leach and an whole lot more of Verbal Kint.

                            This is easy in concept, perhaps hard in effecting.  You shitcan all flag rank officers and only consider colonels  for promotion to replace them. Colonels are not poz’d—at least not all of them.  Those drinking the kool aide in hopes of a flag rank, can be passed over.  Those waiting the few years to mandatory retirement due to being passed over for promotion are what you draw from.  There are over 44 4-star generals.  In WWIl there were 7!.  You can knock these guys out quickly.

Absolutely that’s what we should do, and I’ve thought that for upwards of a decade now.
I don’t wanna tell the JIDF officers reading this thread how I would go about rearranging the pentagon brass, but I do know precisely how I would attack the problem.
Within about 48 to 72 hours, we could completely flip the pentagon.

        Lots of very deep thought to chew on here. This is among the best takes I’ve read on the reason behind the present turmoil. I’ll add a few thoughts and pose a question or two.The managerial state arose not only with the New Deal but also at the time of a pending world war. It seemed to thrive in war time and thus mutated to be linked with permanent conflict. Ever since World War II, the United States has been in perpetual warfare marked by loss and humiliation from time to time, starting with Korea in the immediate aftermath. Does the managerial state as it evolved from the Thirties through the Forties require constant war or crisis to thrive or grow? Struggle seems necessary to maintain the managerial state, whether the conflict is international or domestic with “war” on poverty, drugs, and so forth. Communism suffered the same need.Along these lines, atomization seems to be a particularly white problem. Non-whites have a parasitic relationship with the managerial state but otherwise remain cohesive. Is this a problem with genetic roots or an effect of the existence of the managerial state itself? Kevin MacDonald argues individualism evolved in Europeans and is an immutable trait, but as you point out, prior to the emergence of the managerial state group and associations formed among whites that resulted in collective action; Swedes banded together to protect the Swedish people, for example, and drilling down further, farmers for instance worked together and pooled resources to assist one another. That certainly doesn’t indicate a genetic predisposition toward individualism. Atomization, though, probably has a biological component. Dunno.I agree that widespread information probably has made the managerial state as it existed previously impossible, and the emerging totalitarianism is a likely ill-fated response. Effective propaganda seems necessary to retain a managerial state, but is that possible now?

            The answer is much simpler. Getting new laws passed is a difficult thing to do. It’s much easier to do an end-run around Congress by installing political leadership inside already politicized agencies and pushing the boundaries of their enabling legislation. That’s how we get an EPA, created to clean up our rivers and our smog, going above and beyond their mandate in furtherance of leftist Democrat political agendas.The only answer I can think of is to distribute their work to the states. People at least have recourse at the state level to a far greater extent than they do at the federal level. The federal government is a runaway train that nobody can stop. It answers to nobody.

                Yes, but it required some competence to pull off what amounted to an administrative state coup. As that competence disappeared, even the EPA resorted to armed enforcers. Resort to crude violence indicates a lack of confidence that stems directly from the lack of competence. This also explains the thuggish nature of the managerial state writ large these days. Runaway trains eventually derail and we are seeing that.

                    Thing is, though, that some demographics only respond to crude violence. The state, in its infinite wisdom, chose to view all demographics as interchangeable nails, so of course every problem calls for a hammer.

            “Struggle seems necessary to maintain the managerial state, whether the conflict is international or domestic with “war” on poverty, drugs, and so forth”.I think you definitely hit on something here, JD.  They need constant conflict to keep the plates spinning and it doesn’t matter if there’s resolution or even “victory”.  In fact, it’s probably better for them if there isn’t. All the external conflicts TMS (the managerial state) created since WWII have not been victories at all with the irrelevant exceptions of a few police actions (Grenada!). They left/lost Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan.  And the domestic “wars”, too (poverty, drugs, terror), all failures.  The one on deck, the war on whites, will also fail. But no matter, a new one will be created, just like the Ukraine conflict was created, and when that fails, probably China will be next. Again, it doesn’t matter.  War/conflict is the health of TMS. Their literal survival depends on it.  And as long as the dirt people have a warm house, a cold fridge, and a hotspot, there will be no opposition.

                What they did learn from the noted failures of McNamara and Rumsfeld was to fight their imperial wars using other people’s cannon fodder. See Syria, Libya, Ukraine etc. Some would say that’s how they plan to fight the war on whites too.

            Jack Dobson: “Does the managerial state as it evolved from the Thirties through the Forties require constant war or crisis to thrive or grow?”“Peace” seems to be an exceedingly rare state of affairs in the annals of human history.I fear that there are meta-Darwinian phenomena at work here which likely do compel  &amp; propel constant war into actual physical existence.I wish it weren’t so, but the ghost of Charles Darwin always has the last laugh.PS: Kinda/sorta related to the above [coming at it from the opposite angle]; there’s a new study out which holds that pretty much EVERY SINGLE MAN on the face of the earth is now carrying micro-plastics in his semen.https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfae060https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/toxsci/kfae060/7673133?redirectedFrom=fulltextGeorge Carlin was strangely prophetic on this topic:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rld0KDcan_wIf you’ve never seen it, that’s an epic routine by Carlin.

        Managerialism run amok is societal entropy. It exists because of prolonged affluence which incentivizes parasitic growth due to over abundance. A lean managerial ladder is effective and efficient when based solely upon merit, but destructive when it becomes bloated and cronyistic. The West is rife with bloated and parasitic managerial deadweght that now infects every branch of government and society. Too many 4 star generals, too many faux college professors, too many lawyers, too many Karens, etc. This will not change until real hardship and deprivation reemerge, thereby forcing merit back into a preeminent driver for promotion. Both community strength and individualistic striving are necessary components of a robust society. They are synergistic, not antagonistic.

            That’s not a given. In most real life phenomena, hysteresis is the law, that is, the path from state A to state B is not just the reverse of the path from state B to state A.
There’s no reason to believe hunger and deprivation is necessary, and, apart from some fraction of the leftist revolutions, is not typically the case anyway. Sweden didn’t pull back from their socialist course because of famine, nor did the US break away from Britain because of some Holodomor.

                    So was the French Revolution.
From what I’m seeing IRL and reading here, I don’t think that’s probably it. The constant complaint is that whites are sleeping or grilling or whatever, which is the exact opposite of whites being quicker to take action.
I think it’s probably more to do with ideology. Both hard times and good times make people more susceptible to the leftist propaganda from the usual suspects.

        The question is can this model survive the post-industrial age?I don’t think very much that is within it survives the post industrial age, which should best be defined as an anomalous state of exception at the end of empire. I could expend a lot of verbiage expanding on that point, but you already get the idea. Post industrialism is best analogized with the hedonistic heir of a great fortune, who is now spending it. That anyone takes the concept of post industrialism more seriously than that is the comedy. The wikipedia page on post industrialism is entertaining, in that sense.

            I maintain, and the current USA illustrates, is that there is no such thing as the “post-industrial” age.  Perhaps my (mis)understanding is one of semantics.What I see, and live within, is a society that uses all the products of an industrial society—and then some—but refuses to manufacture them.  Through the magic of financial and military chicanery, we’ve convinced the rest of the world to make our goods and accept IOU’s for such.  We of course—being post IR, will eventually redeem our IOU’s with our “products of the mind”.  Our national debt is testimony to the fallacy.Yes, I know we still manufacture lot of stuff here at home, but not enough to provide a decent living for most of the populace and I agree, I’ve not expressed myself well as I like….

                The recipe for a post-industrial society is military and currency supremacy. It’s that simple. Once you have that most of your “workforce” can be employed doing whatever make-work strikes your fancy. The global nature of modern corporations means that most of them actually do have productive workers employed in places like China or India. Their workforces in America and Europe can basically be put to “work” doing just about anything. Their salaries are the tribute extracted by the American and other Western states.Their wages are taxed to pay for military hardware and hire useless direct government workers.They are essentially paid to keep them busy and out of trouble.This is also why the advocates of guaranteed basic income are wrong. Paying people to do nothing actually *does* work – but only if they and everyone else can lie to themselves that they are actually productive.This also explains DIEversity to some extent. The managerialists probably think it doesn’t matter much *who* is paid to download pr0n and share cat pictures on the internet so why not indulge in hiring our fantasy football team lineup of magical Negros, tri-gendered whatsits, and fat purple haired Karens.I think this is a miscalculation. The DIEverse “workforce” is composed of people who are far more mentally unstable and frankly criminal than the boring White suburban peasants. Their lower IQ means that they also tend to lack the intellect needed to understand how their “work” is actually relevant. Oddly, Shitavious’ stupidity makes him more likely to fail to understand how attending 5 Zoom meetings a day and doing a daily Agile scrum stand-up is valuable. He’s likely to spend his now larger income on the same stuff he always did, black market guns, drugs, and risky sex.

                    Interesting bit there about post-productive fundamentals. I was intrigued by the Vancouver B.C. luxury apt tower where each unit purchase financed a pre-fab shed or house or whatever overseas (supposedly getting this marketing idea from a shoe brand that “buys a pair of shoes for a poor person somewhere” when you buy it). By this means effectively you are exporting your own proles to Phnom Penh. Stakeholders can be manufactured.

        Zman, to mention industrialization and the changes it wrought without discussing the mass immigration that accompanied it is to paint half the picture.  When a quarter of the factory workers are Italian and a quarter are Jews and maybe half speak English, there is no collective ‘us.’  The history of European managerialism is different, but you cannot discuss the changes in American institutions without addressing the changes in the people.  Ellis Island was a minimal processing center, and there existed no magic dirt for the disparate European peasants.

            Great point. The US is the only major country that industrialized simultaneous with a major immigration boom. I would argue that it led to labor being significantly less powerful in the US versus Europe (obviously Japan is a different story). Managerialism in Germany, for example, evolved with labor having a major say (unions have seats on all the major Boards there) in corporate governance. France and the UK weren’t terribly different. It’s also useful to distinguish between Managerialism 1.0 (pre welfare state) and 2.0 (post Welfare state). Immigration’s impact here has been way more powerful and negative in the presence of a welfare state and global trade agreements.

                Education in the USA at that time encouraged patriotism, even nationalism. Every classroom had a flag, and we all said the Pledge in the morning to start the day, almost a religious ritual when you think about it. This was universal and it was deliberate. For a time it seemed that all the disparate peoples in our country had succeeded in forging a “new nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.” Turned out to be bullshit, but it worked for awhile. It certainly helped us win WW2, a national effort if there ever was one.

                        I attended tail end of the 70’s. Had the lead role in the annual Christmas play “It Happens Every Christmas.” I played father Crawford and my “wife” was Betty. The play was held in our elementary school auditorium. Jews were excused from class for the day. Our community attended and brought Christmas treats.

            “Zman, to mention industrialization and the changes it wrought without discussing the mass immigration that accompanied it is to paint half the picture.”
I agree with you.  Many political thinkers continue to do detailed analysis of our political situation while ignoring racial warfare, which is far more consequential than ideology or religion.
I’ve lost my patience with the people on our side who diagnose our sickness as “Communism” or “wokeness.”
If a person on the right cannot see and say that the real issue is non-whites as a group attacking clueless whites, then that person is worse than useless.

        This is a very complicated topic but very fascinating. I hope Zman will continue to explore it. I think Managerialism emerged in each society for different reasons.UK: they had an Empire to manage and the Civil Service emerged from the requirements of Empire. The trading companies (East India etc.) were professionally managed.Germany: Bismarck started expanding the central state to effect Unification (read Steinberg’s excellent biography), but Prussia and other kingdoms had good management to collect taxes and run militariesItaly: it emerged late because Italy unified (1861) and industrialized late. The North got organized to help FIAT and control postwar chaos. The South never got organized haha.US: the railroad, steel and energy cartels of the robber barons had primitive Managerial organizations. The full flowering came from Ford, GM (Sloan) and Edison/Westinghouse. This potential for Managerialism was tapped in WWI (read Baruch’s memoirs) and of course fully exploited in WWII (Kaiser, Knudson et al – read “Freedom’s Forge”). The later failures of the Managerial class – MacNamara, Bernanke, Rumsfeld as the obvious examples – didn’t discourage anyone. They just decided to try harder and control propaganda. Like the hapless Philadelphia 76ers fans, we are told to “trust the process”.

            No one in the managerial class, or anywhere else in the “mainstream,” considers Bernanke a failure. They gave him a Nobel prize. For printing money. Unlike McNamara and Rumsfeld, who were seen as failures, his lionization spawns imitators.I wonder how different the world would have been if Rumsfeld had been Reagan’s running mate in 1980, (Reagan’s first choice I understand), instead of GHWB. Probably not very. But it might have saved us from the Clintons, in the sense that Rumsfeld, being much more charismatic and better in front of the camera than Bush, perhaps would have defeated WJC in 1992.

                True, but the ability to lionize failure is much weaker now. Exhibit A is Anthony Fauci. Despite the attempts to Bernankeize him, Fauci is becoming the face of the failed administrative state to a much wider audience that simply people who think as we do. The proliferation of uncontrolled and probably uncontrollable information makes it all but impossible to prop up failure.

                    Failure may be easier to identify due to uncontrolled information, and therefore lionization more difficult or even impossible, yet few of these bastards ever lose their positions in high places; when they do, they move to high-paying gigs in media, NGOs, global corporations, etc. I am sure that a complete fool like Mayorkas will never need to worry about money, or Buttigieg, Granholm, Austin, Blinken, or any of them – Fauci included.

                    How about not voting for GHW Bush in that election, I told people the following year who were grumbling about the loss.
Bush went on to become best pals with Bill within six months, left him a lovely handwritten note in the Oval and ended up traveling the world with him after Clinton’s 2nd term.
The Bushes never had any problems with the Clintons. Perot Buchanan — they had problems with the Clintons and the Bushes.

                        Not sure what you are getting at.  Bush was riding a wave of popularity due to the Gulf War, but a year or so later, no one wanted to vote for him?  Doubtful.  One needed only look at the critical States Bush lost and the margin to see what a Ross Perot candidacy meant in that election.Perot, wacky as he was, did predict exactly what the North American Free Trade Agreement would mean.  He should have been President in that regard.  And yes, Clinton picked up the ball on that agreement and it passed swimmingly in Congress.BTW, it is traditional that all outgoing Presidents leave a letter for their successor, as does the First Lady leave a small gift for her successor.  Been a tradition like forever.  Obama’s did the same for Trump.  It signifies tradition and respect for that tradition, nothing more.

                                Yeah, I hear ya.  But Biden probably would have used it as a weapon against Trump.  These letters are kept quiet/confidential traditionally as I recall.  Even at that, the rumor was that the Obama’s could barely restrain their open distaste for Trump when he had his traditional talk/meeting with Obama before the inauguration.  The Obama’s were the epitome of “low rent” individuals.

        I cannot agree that industrialization destroyed communities. In fact, the term “community” is one of the most prominent tropes of postmodern AINO. You have the African-American community, the Moslem community, the gay community, the Jewish community, the trans-community, the Wiccan community, and so on and so forth, ad infinitum. Idenitity politics, the chief poltical form of the age, is nothing if not the reification of the community. Of course, these communities are formed and draw oxygen, to a significant degree, from official exhortation and propagandization. The Power Structure gets the communities it wants. It also destroys the communities it fears and loathes. And I don’t have to tell anybody around here what those communities are.

            In some cases, industrialism “created” communities, with the caveat that if the inhabitants shared a commonality (like, oh, say, ethnicity) a community could grow up around an industrial base. I think of two examples, copied from a comment I made at Sailer’s site (Yeah, I know, I know, but don’t dismiss it quite yet):Cicero in one way mirrors Hamtramck, MI. Both had large employers located in the town. Cicero had Western Electric’s Hawthorne Works, Hamtramck had Dodge Brothers, later to be Dodge Division of Chrysler Corporation. Both towns boomed with the creation of the factories (Hawthorne Works in 1905, Dodge Brothers in 1913) and Eastern European (Poles, Czechs, Bohemians, etc.) immigrants moving there for work and good wages. Wiki tells me at its height Hawthorne Works employed 45,000. Chrysler historians report Dodge Main in Hamtramck employed 33,000 at its height.Both Cicero and Hamtramck had heavily Eastern European populations around them. Ironically a combination of de-industrialization and prosperity changed the faces of the community. To continue:Business changed, and the old plants were increasingly outmoded compared to newer plants. In the 1970s Dodge Main and Hawthorne Works, built before air conditioning and efficient central heating must’ve cost a fortune to heat and cool after the first energy shocks of the early 1970s. Increasing automation eliminated jobs and in Dodge Main’s case, the tall multistory assembly plant wasn’t as efficient as a single story assembly plant like the one at Belvedire, IL. I’d wager Hawthorne Works was a big waste of space as well. As technology advanced and machinery got smaller management looked around and figured they’d close the plants. Dodge Main closed in 1980, at that point only 5,000 or so employees were still there. Wiki tells me Hawthorne Works closed in 1983, but since my father used to work there, I’d have sworn it had closed by the late 1970s. Dodge Main closed as a consequence of Chrysler’s near bankruptcy, it just couldn’t afford running and retooling the plant. Wiki claims Hawthorne Works was closed as result of the AT&amp;T break up. It was probably closed for the same reason Dodge Main was: AT&amp;T looked at the costs/benefits of keeping it open and said “Nope”.Left unsaid of both Cicero and Hamtramck was as prosperity grew (or demographics changed) younger generations went to college, got into white collar work, and moved out of their towns. Once the manufacturing left the older generations either sold and moved to be with their children, or in my grandfather’s case, the surviving relatives sold the house after they died.(We’ll leave out what GM did to Poletown/Hamtramck in the early 1980s for another discussion)Well with property values falling since there wasn’t the amount of high paying work there was before, immigrants moved in. Latinos in Cicero, Arabs in Hamtramck.Immigration too probably heavily counted in tearing up the ties that bound townspeople together.

Of course it did. That was the purpose behind it. Those educated children of factory workers might have and probably would have been more prone to return to town if it looked like a decent place to live and raise a family.

            “Icannot agree that industrialization destroyed communities.”A huge point in Ostei’s favor is that the factory owners built the communities.Examples would be Detroit’s Eight Mile and surrounding towns for the auto factories or Milwaukee’s breweries building communities.  Western towns built around a rail depot or mine; Oklahoma, West Texas, and Kansas City stockyards.I was once somewhere in Michigan where the workers literally walked across the street from their homes to the large factory complex there.  Those Midwest towns were built by business owners trying to attract a stable labor force; the company built their apartments, bus or trolley lines, and the roads and utilities so the workers had a place to live and a way to get to work.Heck, that’s where the Industrial Revolution slums and tenements came from.It was the Civil Rights internal invasion that drove whites from the city centers they had built; suburbs are White refugee camps.Perhaps, then, we can modify today’s by saying that postmodern managerialism arose from having to corral and organize internal immigration.  Postwar Europe had great swathes of displaced peoples.

                You can’t ignore the impact of the usual suspects here. Company towns fell out of favor largely through (((their))) influence with the ideology of “Workers, Unite”.
As you point out, horse-drawn trolleys were commonplace. Workers weren’t generally forced to live in the “tenements”, but had to get from wherever they lived to the trolley, until that area got built up enough to justify extending the route.
The problem is that socialism just is not compatible with an industrial society. It’s not possible for everyone to live at someone else’s expense. Consequently, socialism always ends in a death spiral and de-industrialization.

        Individualism is figuratively and in some cases literally killing White people in the USA. Whites NEVER help or support one another. How many videos have you seen of a White kid being beaten in a school hallway by ferals while dozens of other White kids look on and do nothing. I may have mentioned this before but I spoke with a Pakistani multimillionaire who said that unrelated Indians and Pakistanis will by shares in covienence stores. As the money comes in they will buy a larger share in the next store until eventually they are making enough money to buy their own stores outright. I know the Indian convenience store owner cliché is a big joke but these people are building serious wealth. I can’t imagine half a dozen White people who are strangers to each other buying and operating a small business together. Buying stock in Apple and GM is not the same thing.

            Interestingly, my parents were part of a group which did exactly that in the early 1980s to prevent the entry of a chain-style convenience store from entering into the tiny (population &lt;1000) midwestern town in which I grew up. They teamed up with three other local businesspeople (grocery store owner, gas station owner, and telephone company owner) to build a convenience store. It ended up being a good investment, and the profits stayed in the local community.
They sold their interest last year, but the store still operates and the plan was successful. Small victories still count.

            I have seen once and again here and I have suffered it a lot in my life. Whites are the only non-tribal people in the world. We don”t help each other: we move because of ideology, meritocracy, status, money or power but not because of tribal solidarity. Our history explain that.
The modern world is tribal and we are not. We are getting crushed because of that.

                That’s not true, though. German solidarity was to Germans. That’s why the Schlieffen Plan had them sweeping through Belgium to take out France early in WWI.
“White” has never been a tribe. The winning play was to somehow convince us that it was, despite the fact that historically and genetically, we are not.

                    Whites most certainly are a tribe. The genetic distance between an Icelander and a Bulgarian is far less than between a Bulgarian and a Chinaman, let alone a negro.

                        And? Much the same can be said about the various black races, but they recognized tribal differences, just as the various Europeans did. And still do, for that matter.
The US Constitution was written mostly with English and Dutch Protestants in mind. To a greater or lesser degree, Nordics, Hessians, Irish, Scotch, Welsh, Mediterraneans, Slavs, etc. all faced being the outsiders, despite the genetic similarities.

        The old industrial model of governance has tried to adapt to the transition to the information economy, but managing information is vastly more difficult than managing capital and labor.
The trouble with the information economy is, we have a surplus of information, much of it spurious, and a deteriorating real economy, i.e. an economy that produces useful material things.
The financial/managerial class use the phrase “information economy” to con people into believing that the bit fiddlers and manipulators of pretend money contribute things useful to the rest of humanity.

        I wonder how effective the transition to an atomized society would’ve been if not for the never ending waves of new immigrants causing protestant flight &amp; roaming blacks inducing general white flight. Even things like carpet baggers flooding the south &amp; radical shifts in the economy that caused migration throughout the country that left certain regions in the dust had to have bolstered the atomization.America was a divided country from it’s inception &amp; seemingly everything that followed was one chaotic event after another that had the effect of increasing social instability. It was obviously doomed from the moment the colonies lost their sovereignty, that ensured there was going to be a rat race to control the central power of the federal government, with that instability was baked into the cake. Still, it didn’thaveto end up as messy as it did, I suspect if there even a modicum of concern about that the fragmentation wouldn’t have been so severe. As it stands if one wanted to intentionally splinter a country into an atomized mess the history of the US provides a gold standard blueprint on how to accomplish it.

        The intractable obstacle in the years ahead is that only the people who constructed complex systems are capable of paring them down to their essential parts for those without the capacity to understand the whole of things. Sort of an emergency switch so the monkey can keep the lights on and the water running, and nothing else, until the larger problems can be fixed or the system can be taken in for a soft, final landing like an airplane with half an engine left.Unfortunately, those people are gone. Thus we are going to continue to add layers of complexity onto this decaying system until some June day when a plane covered in gay pride colors plops right into a terminal.

        I use my HOA as an example of how managerialism takes root.  A community is formed around the idea of a shared interest: protecting property values.  If you don’t agree with that and you don’t want to join an HOA, don’t buy the property.  Easy, right?Instead, humans being human, they figure a bird in the hand, right?  Buy the land with absolutely no intention of following the community’s well-published rules.  Then set about violating them all while complaining about the HOA.The HOA naturally responds with enforcement actions, and things escalate until everyone winds up in courts. There are examples of parties spending tens of thousands of lawyer and court fees over a $500 fine because of 30 junk cars parked in the front yard.  Everyone knows 30 junk cars in the front yard harms property values of the neighbors and attract rats.  But, here we are in court.Into this mess steps an HOA “management company”.  For an annual fee, they’ll manage the HOA for you.  The Board just needs to show up.  The “management company” soon seizes control mainly because Board members couldn’t be bothered.  Needing validation, even the smallest annoyances get met with fines and escalation.  That’s where the money is, after all.And now you’ve got a subsidized managerial state paid for by disinterested homeowners unwilling to just run it themselves because their neighbors, some of them, are kooks that can’t be run off.Oh, and the State writes rules that disembowel the HOA’s ability to enforce their own community rules.How did we get a managerial state?  A combination of shitbags who think they can do any dirty, dangerous, disgusting thing they want and disinterested (or beaten down) volunteers who lack the desire to do anything about it.Who is left?  People on a power trip and companies looking to extract a profit from people not paying attention to where their money goes.My 81 year old mom has worked a charity clothing sale for many years.  They collect donated clothes and sell them at very cheap prices.  The proceeds go to a local hospice.  It’s a bidirectional charity because poor people benefit from cheap, often still new/tagged, name brand clothing.  The hospice benefits from the proceeds.Sensing an opportunity for unrealized profit, new “managers” stepped in this year and raised prices while yelling at the volunteers.  Sales tanked and they had bags and bags of unsold clothing.  volunteers, many had been doing this for years, got fed up and walked out.We have become, as a society, everything we should despise.  The only thing that matters is money, and the hell with you; I don’t care if you die as long as I get to do what I want.

            In his book, “Spiteful Mutants”, Dutton terms this “pathological individualism” which he describes as an affliction predominantly on the Left, rather than Right.  Basic premise as I now understand is that individualism is limited to that which does not ignore the group/community goals.  Beyond that is pathological.  I need to reread at a future point.

        On a simplistic level, humans strive for control.  If they can control themselves and the environment, a greater possibility of future survival is enhanced.  Extrapolate that out over an ever increasing complex societal population and culture (diversity, technology etc) the natural emergence of a managerial class seems to be a naturally occurring unconscious act of control.  Add the feminine angle of safety and equality what could go wrong?  We’re now convinced that we can control everything in modernity, but in reality we never could and never will.

        One more thought re: “Self-government rests on the assumption that the bulk of the citizens have a moral duty to the whole. Who they are is not just what they have or even what they contribute to the whole.”This still worked until recently in relatively homogeneous societies like the ones in northern Europe. Maybe it’s still even does. It both has to do with the Protestant ethic of honesty and hard work, and not wanting to take more out of the system than you put into it. In America, Inc. it’s grab what you can before somebody else gets it.

                There’s a lot of truth to that, but I think homogeneous society is the bigger reason. When you have a homogeneous society, you’re all in it together. Social programs you’re fine with because you’re helping others like you in need who have your values and aren’t milking the system. When you’ve got all kinds of people from all kinds of places, you don’t necessarily have any bond to them. Then I have the fact that they are milking the system and you have our situation today.

        The managerial state couldn’t exist without free money. The U.S. and its tributaries are presently the only bloc that can create free money in the form of the US dollar. The BRICs countries are now trying to break away from this bloc and create their own alternative bloc with its own currency but that has the same inherent problems as the so-called “Eurodollar” (which is an unplanned expansion of the Federal Reserve US dollar.) When this type of financial system fails, the managerial state will also fail. The expansion of free fiat money will fail at some undetermined point and it will be epic. But a major inflection point will be the failure of Project Ukraine when millions will profoundly lose their faith in the system. And ultimately every fiat regime relies on faith in the system of credit, that intangible which underlies fiat money.There is an alternative to free money that doesn’t rely of faith in fiat. That’s a type of crypto-currency properly constructed, probably bitcoin. But that assumes the electricity remains on. That’s a big assumption because people are beginning to understand the competency crisis as a real thing. Further, bitcoin and the like have a scaling problem which may or may not be solved.In any event, the hysterical lashings-out of the elites is an instinctive reaction to the key players in the so-called “international rules-based order” recognizing the mounting failures of their system. Those who don’t lose faith early will lose everything.It’s probably too late for this foundering vessel to right itself. If it doesn’t, we will probably devolve to a lower level of organization. The ancient civilizations of the middle east, China, the Americas, and medieval European christianity also had an elite (based on the ability to read and write) but its ability to control the populace was nothing compared to the current managerial system with its endless edicts. This system of control relies heavily on credentialism. At this point in time, the university system in the West issuing the credentials is rapidly losing the confidence of the people and thus the faith in credentialism is becoming unmoored by the hollow reality of its product, people who have useless skills at a basic level. This means the end of the hyper-state as an organizing principle. That is what we are witness to.

            If the population declines like some say is intended, a gold standard could even become viable again. But right now there are too many people in the world for a gold backed reserve currency. Some small nations could pull it off, if they had the gold.
Which illustrates the problem the BRICS are dealing with, that in this age there is no easy answer to replacing fiat. One could even say that it was only fiat that made this age possible. So its end would be the end of the age also, and not just in a monetary sense.

Why? Other than people insisting trying to tie some value to a given mass of gold, I mean. Avoid that rookie mistake, let it float, and the quantity problem goes away.

                    Exactly.  There is, as they say, a price that will clear the market.  Fiat currency is different than gold backed currency.  Gold backed simply means you can convert your paper currency into gold at a set amount of the element.  You can use silver as well as was the case up to 1964.  Yeah, in the 1930’s you got about a once of gold for your twenty dollar bill.  What if that was now reduced to a tenth of a gram?  Gold is now about $2400 for one once or about 31.1 grams.  Seems that Russia has no problem with gold backed rubles.

                But right now there are too many people in the world for a gold backed reserve currency.It would require an honest economy to get away from the inflationary fiat currency systems being employed around the world today. It seems probable that we have too many people for everyone to be a legitimate productive member of society in our current age of automation and mechanization and that would make an honest economy difficult.I will define an  honest economy as one that runs on balanced budgets in the private and government sectors. The benefit of a specie currency over a fiat is it is naturally a hard currency. A hard currency would work very well and be preferreable in a balanced economy. The theft of future value wouldn’t happen because we couldn’t run a deficit economy like we do now pretending we can have free stuff if we imagine more money into existence. Our failure is the price we have to pay for being stupid.It goes without  saying we will never see anything resembling an honest economy in our lifetime.

                    Yes, but…
Balanced budgets cannot work for the private sector. Even if you were to build your home out of cast-off pallets you find somewhere, it would take several years to accumulate materials and get the structure set up, and you still don’t have plumbing, electrical, heat, windows, roofing, etc. The only way that works is to borrow from your future earnings to compensate someone else for having done the work you need to have a place to live.
The only reasonable way to get to balanced is Dave Ramsey, and that leaves younger people in the same place.

                            How so? Both reflect consumption of current goods, both are contingent on a particular vision of the future, both are made with the lender expecting repayment. He even put it in his ledger, twice.
But I definitely agree 0% is crazytalk. Even low time preference people like whites have a preference above zero. Might as well have access to those funds in case something comes up.

            Bitcoin requires faith. A hypothetical gold standard would be, well, not destroyed, but seriously impaired if there were a breakthrough in extracting gold from seawater. Similarly, an breakthrough in computing would impact cryptography, and, given the relatively fledgling state of computing (presumably — odds are good that any technology that young is not at it’s zenith) that’s much more likely than overcoming some of the thermodynamic challenges of gold from seawater.

                “Bitcoin requires faith.”I think I understand what you’re saying, but it doesn’t require faith in the same way even a 100% reserve currency does, let alone fiat. I don’t know anything about the economics of extracting gold from seawater, but at least it wouldn’t be as uneconomic as extracting it from the core of our planet, or from an asteroid, lol.You might have noticed that the central banks of the world still hang onto their gold reserves — even adding to it in some cases — so that tells me there’s a large element of doubt about the role of gold in the future. It depends on what kind of future is waiting for us and nobody knows that. Just some thoughts.

                    The faith of Bitcoin seems in the belief another will take it and that you have the ability to use it without the Internet and a slew of technology behind it.  A gold coin on the other hand is readily accepted even in darkest Africa.

                    Fiat, yes, you have faith that they know how to manage a fiat currency, despite the fact no one has ever done so yet.
100% reserve, no. All you need is some independent group to do the audits. I guess you need faith that the independent group is being honest, but how does that differ from crypto? Just one of the competing auditors is enough to let you decide.
I agree on the role of gold in central banking. My guess is that they are increasing their positions to blunt the new gold-based BRICS exchange.

                Bitcoin is, from my limited understanding, a *fixed* amount.  Yes, they are creating/discovering/mining new Bitcoin, but the mathematics behind it limits this amount and then no more.  That was the whole initial point of Bitcoin—it limits the printing press inflation pump.
Seawater mining of gold, or just new discoveries are an unknown.

                    No, that is correct. The question is how much computing is required to extend the blockchain. Assuming Moore’s Law holds, the rate newer coins are introduced should stay relatively linear, but as we found when people decided to start using graphics cards for “mining”, our predictions of the future are subject to change.
After the last coin is “mined”, there will necessarily be the transaction fees. No one is going to buy the computers or foot the electric bills necessary to do the exponentially more difficult calculations for free.

        Fascinating comment from 2003 on Amazon of Pat Buchanan’s book “Death of the West.” It was written by an 80-year-old (in 2003):Piles of books have been written about the “dumbing down” of America during the past half century and particularly about revisionist history, which I did not notice anyone mentioning. I am 80 years old and attended college in the forties. For ten years I worked as a journalist. When I went into teaching in 1955, I was appalled at how much education had changed since the war of “The Greatest Generation.” We weren’t the greatest generation. We were only the last generation which came of age in a moral world. Writers today contrast our world with that of the fifties. It is because they are so young. In the fifties we were already heading for disaster, but I was acquainted with no one who saw it except myself. I had available only Brave New World and 1984 to justify my view. When I predicted the amoral world of today I was told I was an “alarmist”, that I was making a mountain out of a molehill.The key to Buchanan’s book is in the title, as it should be. It seemed to me that few of the reviewers, positive or negative, saw the big picture. They were either concerned with immigration or “white supremacy” or contemporary Christians. Only a few mentioned the “culture war.” But that is what it is all about, the death of a civilization the like of which this earth has never known before or elsewhere. Buchanan has the disadvantage of having run for office, so on the surface it appears that he is making a political point. This is not so.The rest of the comment is just as good.

            Back in the sixties I read Stephen Benet’s short story, “Last of the Legions” to my classes. It was about a legionnaire in Britain in the last days of the Roman Empire. It is a deeply moving story, and most of the students were moved. We talked about it in comparison with what was happening to our own civilization. Most were concerned, but three girls agreed that they didn’t care because “We won’t be around anyway.”Here is the difference between our culture today and the civilization which started on the downward path in 1939. Before the second half of the twentieth century, everyone thought of “posterity.” Hardly anyone does today, even among those who cherish our civilization. And therefore women are not having children.

        Such a strong start to a Monday.  Just excellent, both the question and the answering.
The article’s buildup is the best part; we can readily see that World War II was the Great Reset of its time.

        As work isolated men from one another, the natural response was to think individually and see the man next you as competition. This was obviously good for the factory owner, so work in many cases became a competitive arena, a Hobbesian existence where the owner harnessed this war of all against all to increase productivity, reduce costs and maximize profits. The result was a class of citizen who was no longer defined by community but by alienation from community.A valid point but I would counter industrialization increased collectivization via unionization. Forget what unions became (“Oh, I always wanted to be a Teamster. So lazy and surly… mind if I relax next to you?”- Homer Simpson), they initially broke through the isolation by promising the working man power in banding together. Certainly we see exactly as you say in post-industrial America.As work isolated men from one another, the natural response was to think individually and see the man next you as competition.How indeed could computer programmers unionize?﻿

        “The question is can this model survive the post-industrial age? America began to deindustrialize fifty years ago.”
The question is really can this model of a “new economy” actually function in a post GAE world.  Will the world accept this model where they are required to work and Americans are required to consume when they are no longer the “jr partner?”

            I like repairing old stuff and occasionally watching the restorations on youtube.  I like the older styling and most old stuff was built to a much higher quality.  So much of what is produced today is just not meant to be repaired or to last very long.  You can make something brand new in China for less money than it takes to repair an existing thing here.

                Tell me about it.  Seems from most of the info I’ve gleaned, my new EV automobile is a throw away.  It’s like those disposable flashlights you buy and then toss after the light dims—and this car cost more than my first home.  Even a minor accident has a 50/50 chance of it being totaled by the insurance company.On the other hand, I took a long distance trip the other day and stumbled upon the auto drive, hands free mode.  100 miles up the road, highway speed, listening to tunes and picking my nose all the way.  For fun, every so often I would close my eyes and wait for the car to yell at me.  😉

                Truth. That’s where I think the future lies. Figure out the weak links that planned obsolescence designed into products, then take the cheap shit from China, change out those component(s).

        Why all of a sudden did Europeans stop thinking collectively and start thinking individually? Racial solidarity among Europeans was so natural it did not require a vocabulary to describe.One possibility (I expect to be “flamed,” as they used to say online, for this):And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

            Racial solidarity doesn’t mean what you want it to mean, though. Franks fought Germanics from the time they met until shortly after WWII. Angles fought Saxons. Danes fought, well, everyone. Etc.

                This is true. However, war is the permanent state of mankind. It is also true of everyone else. Mongolian conquest and Jihad both were stopped at least as much by internal infighting than active resistance.
