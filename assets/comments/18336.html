        Jews from fishmonger to the judges observe their target host population as prey. You *always* overlook this rather inconvenient attribute. Z, I had planned to donate a low five-figure sum to you by the end of September. Since I know you would not want my money I will donate it to dissident right or just keep it for me and mine. Clearly you do not understand the Jews, and I came to know them over time, as my family did for 300 years prior.  Carry on and mind the gap.

            None of us think you actually own a five-figure sum, dumb-shit, much less are in a position to give that to Z.  Even if you did, to  withdraw it because you are offended, thinking that might buy you influence here, is pathetic, like you are.  Why don’t you walk.  No one here will miss you, bitch.

                Moreover – I was thinking, five figures?  Really?  If you said eight or nine, you might have influence.  You really are pathetic if you think offering five figures makes you a “playa.”  Go away before I insult you some more.

                    And actually, the showing of the “humble brag” as in: “I have the five figures to give to you, but now won’t” … is just lame.
Always more honorable to give in quiet, and even anonymously.Only Mr. Z needs to know who you aren’t and what you give.
WHY does your ego find a benefit from talking publicly about all the money you have?

            Wow. Running the gambit from ticking off the JQenazi to the multi-culti trolls. Good show today. I appreciate the nuance even if my thoughts differ from yours on some subjects. Sorry you missed out Daddy Warbucks big five figure donation… you’ll just have to settle for my low two figure contribution coming again directly. Carry on, Sir.

        I live in a neighborhood with one acre tracts and nice houses.  I worked hard for this, nothing was given to me.  Fuck you if you think I owe anything to you or to anyone else, other than being a good person and a good member of the community, which I am.There is a plot of land next to us that several developers have, through the years, tried to put in a housing density that is way more dense than what we enjoy.   I’m not talking half acre lots, That would be fine.  What I am talking about is 8-10 times the current density. These vultures of course are trying to extract housing value from me and my neighbors.I never felt badly going to the planning commission and expressing my displeasure, along with all my neighbors, at these proposed changes.  So far we have done a great job of preventing development on this land in the densities that developers have wanted to. Libertarians may bitch at this, but fuck them (you).  Libertarians are all about extracting wealth from others if you (they) can get away with it.  Well I am here to tell you, bitch, you can’t.  Not from me.I am no conservative, libertarian, progressive, anarchist or communist.  I am a freaking white man homeowner who knows when someone is trying to extract equity from me.  So far we have been happy  (my community is 96% white and normal) to say, look, if you want to develop this land the way the rest of the land around it is developed, we are all in favor.  We will celebrate it.  We will help you find people like us to inhabit it.But libertarianism is all about extracting profits and that is why they are worse than communists.  Zman is right that Libertarians and pseudo-conservatives (like Goldburg and Shapiro) should be punched in the face when you see them.  There is something to be said about protecting a community, and giving that community a say in what goes on.  I don’t know what we are going to do in the future as dissident right members, but one thing we need to focus on is our communities.  That includes white communities.  If you won’t fight for your family and those like you, you are my enemy. That is all.

            Tom’s diner is in downtown Denver. The objection to tearing it down is that it is “historic”, not that the replacement is out of place. So, very little of what you wrote is on point.

        The JQ for me is a practical one, not whether Jews have some demon gene that makes impossible to negotiate with or not. I don’t really care about that question because it doesn’t matter. Jews are on top at moment, and we’re hiding in the shadows so they’re not going to negotiate regardless.How we reached this position can be debated, but the truth is that the Jewish community is by far the biggest impediment to our reaching our short and long-term goals. Z is right that if whites wake up and start to think like a group, Jews would be a minor problem. But Jewish leaders have proven over and over that they do everything in their power to stop whites from doing that.Jews have massive influence – in not outright control – of the media and academia along with huge amount of monetary resources and a never-ending stream of advocacy groups that will sue you into oblivion. All of that stands directly in our way.How Jews acquired this power (I’m more or less on the same page as Z though I’d add that 20th century America was the perfect environment for their species) and whether they wield it as an organized conspiracy (they don’t) or just lots of people with similar ideas and goals working toward those goals (my belief) doesn’t matter! It’s there, and it’s our main obstacle.I don’t focus on Jews because I hate Jews. (Like a lot of people here, I’ve had and continue to have Jewish friends.) And I don’t much care why they are the way that they are. I focus on Jews because they are doing more to block whites from thinking like a group that anything else, including other whites. Those screaming, blue-haired lesbos couldn’t stop a boy scout troop. Gates and Buffet would be donating their billions to building a wall if it won them praise from a white-controlled media.Jews declared war on whites, likely because they buy into the Holocaust narrative so in their minds, it’s us or them. That’s all I need to know.

            Pretty much where I’m at.  When I want to be pedantic about it, I call myself a “counter-Semite” rather than AS.  I didn’t throw the first punch and I’ll be glad to return to my corner once they’ve been counted out.

                Z and I have a different C-S definition, FWIW.  I’m using “counter” in the sense of “counter-reaction” to initial hostility.  I also subscribe to “do as Jews do (in the postive identity sense, at least), just stop letting them do it to us.”  Can’t think of a better word than “counter” for that, so I’ll go with “contra-Semitism” for reaction and adopt Z’s construction for the “parallel tactical” version.  This moment in linguistic autism brought to you by “3rd cup of coffee.”

        Just a small PSA since it came up yesterday buried deep in the comments. Chateau Heartiste has -not- been revived. The site now using that domain is not the proprietor and masterful wordsmith of the old site. It is either some poser wearing the skinsuit of Heartiste. PA who was a prolific commenter on that site has been in contact directly with CH on Gab and he has stated he has nothing to do with the new site.This will become abundantly clear if any ‘original’ material appears as the writing style would be a dead give away. Just FYI as I see this news is starting to spread around to various D-right sites.

            That’s a black pill.  Did this poseur scrape the old posts?  Will mothball that site until I get confirmation something’s legit.  I don’t have the time or sound-bite inclination for GAB or Twitter nowadays, so I’m lagging on current events.

                Yeah man it is pretty messed up. The entire site was put up in a public link as an archive so getting the material was not difficult. But the fact he registered a domain too is extremely obnoxious. Heartiste’s gab feed makes 0 mention of restarting the website so I don’t doubt what PA said. The site may also be a honeypot to snare wrongthinkers too? Who knows these days.

        It’s really peculiar you make one of Kevin Macdonald’s arguements to argue against Kevin Macdonald, it’s one of the stronger arguments. CoC is spent largely validating that argument. Relistening to the segment I think you make the point you haven’t read it in awhile, so I think I can bridge your position between the Boomerisms and those woke on semitic politics.Kevin’s book isn’t particularly anti-semitic, a lot of Jews I know have read it expecting it to be Mein Kampf to only agree with it. The tendency is probably a group-selected strategy, at least the directionality towards militant tribalism. I don’t think Cochran disagrees with group evolutionary strategy just the degree with which it happens.However,  anecdotally you can see group evolutionary strategies forming among European groups throughout history despite no grand strategy. In fact it tends to be from the direction of avoiding what fails than finding what is best.The best case for the CoC and other fact finding books though is to say: never again should we introduce a notoriously hostile minority population, give them the franchise, and give them institutional power. The issue cut both ways and people who brought them here are also culpable. The context of post WWI America was such a politically libertine environment that allowed for big universities to import the trash theorists of Europe.

            Cochran would want a genetic basis for group evolutionary strategy. Since there is none, he would not be interested in the argument. GES is just Intelligent Design for anti-Semites. It’s a way to explain phenomena in terms of the purpose, rather than cause. On the other hand, a genetic bottleneck, high endogamy and a unique cultural history are causes that explain observed phenomenon.

                I can live with that.  In MacDonald’s recent interview with Enoch he basically acknowledged that he wasn’t a genetics guy on a GATC level and seemed to lean much more on cultural influences to explain similar behavior over time.  I’m not going to sperg over disagreements in causation so long as we broadly agree on the mutually observed effects.  Someone’s third-gen removed Jewish genes don’t wholly explain why the grandkids are up to (((tricks))).  To the extent “crypto-Jewish” ancestry decides whether you’re Team Based or Team Woke, it’s because of genes + upbringing rather than merely carrying some genetic “demon seed.”That said, it would take many generations to “de-Talmud” Jews as a group because the genes for neuroticism, aggression and extreme ethnocentrism still set the parameters. The Jewish Bell Curve leans heavy toward some traits we don’t select for in more altruistic White societies, but they share enough similarities that they can (((shapeshift))), so the gulf between us isn’t as wide as that with Blacks or Latins, for instance.  Asians are even more White-compatible than Jews in that they don’t share the neuroticism.As things stand, I think we need a strong apartheid approach toward Jews as a group, making the same limited allowances for NAJALT’s of their “Sociable Seventh” as we would with “Talented Tenth” browns, numbers selected for verbal flow rather than scientific accuracy, of course.FWIW, I still think there’s a hidden set of factors we’re missing with “natural selection,” some kind of epigenetic effect that might predispose succeeding generations to appropriate evolutionary modification – the biological equivalent of the ghost/carrier/hidden wave in quantum theory (which no one has found and most consider disproven).

                    I’d say high-Spanish or Portugese Latins are much more “like us” than Asians or Blacks. Asians may not have the neuroticism, but they differ from us greatly on other measures — honesty, individualism, creative thinking, etc. Mestizo Latins are basically Amerinds, and I still like them better than most Blacks and Asians.

                        I was going to qualify the Latin part on reflection – depending on how “Iberian” the Latin as well.  Mexicans definitely make better neighbors on avg than Blacks.  Asian is fairly broad, we’re more compatible with Japanese and Koreans and SE Asians, in that order, in my experience than Han.

                            I’ll go with that qualification on Asians. I’ve had pretty good experiences with Japanese, but some pretty horrific ones with Chinese in the tech industry. Indians tend to be nice one-on-one, but you can’t help noticing that every time you get an Indian manager, the office starts filling up with Indian employees.* That’s not good for my people.
*That also happens with Chinese. On the other hand, there aren’t enough Japanese immigrants for that to really be a problem. They seem to like Japan.

                Z, what about the Holocaust or, more importantly, the Holocaust narrative being a catalyst in changing Jewish behavior. Since at least the 1960s, each Jewish generation (really, all of us) is taught that whites – even an extremely scientific and sophisticated white society like Germany in the 20s – can turn on a dime against Jews if put under a bit of economic or political pressure to the point that they’ll literally try to genocide the Jewish race.That’s what Jews are taught by their parents and leaders. That has to have some impact on their larger goals for how to shape white societies.No need for a demon gene when you’re taught that your khaki-wearing white neighbors are all one recession away from putting you on a train to a concentration camp.

                    In his book, Hazony wrote a chapter on the impact of the Holocaust on Jewish thinking. On the one hand, it motivates the Zionist to be as tough and ruthless as necessity requires. Never again means never being a victim. On the other hand, for most Jews, never again means never taking any responsibility for anything. The forever victim.
Ironically, the Frankfurt school gaslighted the Jews more than the gentiles.

                        Well, there’s another can of worms: Israeli Jews vs American Jews. In my admittedly limited sample size, I’ve noticed no great love between the two groups. Granted, I know regular, middle-class types, not the great and the good. But Israeli Jews tend to find American Jews to be a bunch of wusses. American Jews find Israeli Jews to be abrasive.
It’s a funny dichotomy. American Jews support Israel almost unconditionally but don’t seem to much like Israeli Jews. They certainly don’t seem to have a great desire to move there.

                        One of the things that occasionally gets mentioned, but not nearly often enough is the fact the “holocaust” had never really happened until the late 70’s early 80’s.
On the basis of no new information and very little pre-existing information it suddenly became the mandatory front and center topic of the biggest mass slaughter and world changing event in history.
Quite remarkable.

                            The Holocaust discussion is both a huge no-no and the ultimate red pill. In one sense, you can’t make yourself look like a loon to normies any faster than to say that the Holocaust might not be 100% accurate. OTOH, once you realize that they’ll lie (exaggerate, really) about the Holocaust, you understand that literally everything that you’ve been told is suspect at best, and a total lie at worst.
That said, recruitment is our #1 goal and bringing up the Holocaust works directly against that.

Like all history there are complications necessary to a proper understanding unknown to most of the population. But the Nazis were responsible for the deaths of millions of Jews and saying ~”it ‘happened’ in the ’60s and ’70s” is loonishly stupid.

                Speaking of genetics, another issue with the JQ is out-marriage rates. Ashkenazi Jews marry non-Jews about half the time. Even if those kids are being raised as Jews, they’re only 50% genetically Jewish.I happen to believe that Jews main advantage over whites isn’t their vaunted high IQ, which is likely somewhat higher but not be enough to overcome our numbers. No, what I’ve notice with Jews is an intellectual and business-minded aggressiveness that on average far surpasses whites. They love the game, and they love to win. Great salespeople, great at starting and pushing a business.Anyway, those genes are getting watered down through inter-marriage. Those kids will be as smart but not as aggressive. The number of “Jews” will remain the same, but genetically, they won’t be full Jews and thus they won’t act like full Jews.Just a thought.

                    “Those kids will be as smart but not as aggressive.”
Why would aggressiveness drop off faster than smartness? I suppose it’s possible that Jews’ choices in mates might favor the former more than the latter, but it’s not obviously true.

                Group selection isn’t bunkum.  From the point of view of our understanding of complex physical system and how they function… group selection (multi-level selection) is the better explanation.

            Skeptics of MacDonald tend to rely on some variation of either “it’s not an explicit conspriacy” or NAJALT.  I agree with both points but don’t see how they disprove MacDonald in any way.  We have no qualms seeing R-selection/high time preference as Black evolutionary strategies but the burden of race-realist proof seems to ramp up for Jews.I don’t like psychologizing disagreements and writing them off to bias – after all, it’s a (((Freudian))) tactic, but I have to point out that Jews are much more sympathetic, culturally adjacent and otherwise “sorta-in-groupy” figures for non-J-woke Whites than Blacks or Latins.  It’s much easier to drop the hatefact-hammer on the really-not-like-us than those who can seem so like us that we call them (((shapeshifters))).NAJALT, and there’s not a monolithic explicit central conspiracy, but Jews and those adjacent to them will tend to act in ways which further shared group interests even without overt collusion.  The mechanism for this is the same self-reinforcing mix of genes and behavior/culture/upbringing that makes every other race what they are in race-realist eyes.  This seems like EvoPsych 101.  If there’s some fundamental concept I’m missing that doesn’t amount to a variation of those approaches, someone please clue me in.

                Totally agree. Bindis are the most assertive people on the planet, and that’s putting it charitably.  Finding a way to play them against the Han is one strategy sane White leaders concerned about their people’s future should be focused on, but instead we’re importing their smart fraction and giving them climate welfare.

        I’m not an anti-Semite by nature, but the more I run across evidence of their outsized and malevolent influence on the country of my birth, the harder it is to look the other way. Just a few bright line examples:This linkhttps://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.phpshows a list of the top donors to political campaigns by election cycle. Res ipsa loquitur.The biggest disaster of my lifetime was the the Hart Celler Immigration act of 1965. Feel free to look up Celler to learn more about him.The President’s Commission on Imigration in the early 1950’s and their report “Whom We Shall Welcome?”  laid the groundwork for the 1965 Immigration Act. The chairman and executive director of this commission were both Jews.I could list the (lonnnnnng list of) prominent Neocons who goaded us into the endless wars that have ravaged the Middle East, flooded the west with aliens and benefited only one nation, but I don’t want anyone to think I have “the Jew thing”…

        It was Paul Gottfried who launched E. Michael Jones into the JQ when at a Chronicles meeting he asked why he wasn’t calling out the Jews for their transgressions.
If you are not religious and especially Christian there are lot of explanations or even insights that are completely of your radar. The sins of  the Jews and their sellout/crucifixion of Christ. More importantly, the subsequent rejection of Christ through millennia.

        I have spent a lot of time around Jews. I have dated Jewish women and even lived with a close Jewish friend. When I was younger and had more time for friends, I had a large circle of Jewish friends.  It has been my experience that Jews are the most race conscious people in America. It is hard to overstate how important being Jewish is to Jewish people.  One of the reasons there are so many rabid antisemites is because how much Jews love to talk about their being Jewish and how much they wrap their identity up in doing things we on the dissident right do not like. Jews will say ‘supporting social justice is extremely important to my identity as a Jew’We might be the same way if we were a small minority.  If you are a fresh water fish living in the ocean, the topic of fresh water is just going to come up a lot. When everyone is the same race/ethnicity, there is really no reason to talk about it. I think I have met more Jews with a white identity than actual white people with a white identity. Although to them, white was secondary. None of them were anti-white though. I never thought of Jews as anti-white because I never knew an anti-white Jew.

            The Jews are greatly divided themselves.  There are anti-Zionist Jews who embrace globalism and are more or less content to let modernity obliterate Jewish identity along with all other identities in a liberal McWorld.  There are secular Jewish Zionists, there are traditional religiously observant Jewish Zionists who are opposed to the Jewish settlements on Palestinian land, and so on.Men like Paul Gottfried and Darren Beattie are brilliant and tremendous assets, and to risk driving them away is absurd.  Our position is dire, we need allies, and Jews can be extremely smart and capable people.  As Israel’s position is continually weakened and Jews in the West are made to suffer more and more as a product of world globalization and the fall of America and Europe to Third World hordes, more and more Jews will seek allies to resist it all.  They are desperately needed.  I don’t care what role Jews have played in this in the past, we have to assess our position and move forward in the smartest way possible.  Jews should be, and can be allies.  As with whites, the interests of the vast majority of Jews are not served by the advance of globalization and the left-liberalism that justifies it.  We have no margin for error, and we are in a desperate situation.Obsession with Jews is a labor saving device in discerning what has gone wrong, and it potentially offers a relatively easy fix, and thus it is very tempting.  I don’t deny the role of the Jews in our demise, but I do deny that whites of the past and today are not tremendously at fault themselves.I’ll risk making people angry and say it directly: it is liberalism in the broad sense, and the bourgeois soul of whites who have consistently refused to draw a line in the sand, look the liberal elites in the eye, and say “this much liberalism and no more.”  Only the Confederates did that, and they were heavily composed of Southern farmers and planter aristocracy compared to the more urban industrialized North.  To this day, the white conservative bourgeoisie “move with times,” refuse to be realists on race, to honestly face what is coming, and to do all they can to slow or prevent it.  All of this, even as their children and grandchildren are being lined up for Brazil style favelas and South Africa style conditions in which whites are literally, more and more, hunted prey.  It’s demented, it’s sickening, and it represents the COLOSSAL failure of a culture (white bourgeois culture), an ideology (faith in American institutions), and a system (liberalism).  They want to believe the liberal elite class’ lies because they don’t want to feel impelled to do anything risky.  They want a quiet life of materialism and status signaling, and they are willing to be willfully stupid if need be to attain it, even if their offspring will tremendously suffer for it.  No responsibility=no solution, as someone once wrote.  If whites will not take responsibility for Western Civ., for doing what objectively needs to be done to save it, it will not be saved.  One way or the other, white conservative bourgeoisie have no future.

            “Jews are the most race conscious people in America.”
You are in error.
Jews mostly think, rightly, that they are white. So of course they’re not consciously anti-white even if some of them indulge in Progressivist effective anti-whiteism.
But, is there any significant number of, e.g., non-race-conscious, Blacks or Asians?

                Blacks are extremely race conscious, but I would say they are 2nd in their race consciousness to Jews. Hell, the NAACP was started by Jews.  Besides, blacks are not particularly effective with their race consciousness. They can impose chaos, but the damage they do is limited.

                    The whites who organized the NAACP were William English Walling (religious? – apparently not Jewish), Mary White Ovington (Unitarian), and Henry Moskowitz (Jewish). What this is supposed to have to do with the race consciousness level of Jews I can’t imagine.

        Mike Enoch’s warned about people who have just taken the J Pill.
They tend to see the tribe everywhere and ascribe all ills loudly to the behatted ones, thus freaking out normies and getting into trouble. It’s a dangerous phase in their development. They need a shepherd to guide them through without alienating their friends, loosing their jobs, or not ending up on a baddie list.
Anyways, I thought that Enoch’s warning related to this weekend’s show which was excellent BTW.

            I think there may be a generational aspect. I’m old enough to remember when ethnic humor was common. It was on television. Therefore, group characteristics were not some great taboo. It was a standard part of TV comedy. That ended in the 80’s, so if you’re under 40, you grew up never hearing ethnic jokes or ethnic slurs. Maybe some mild racism, but nothing hinting at antisemitism. Therefore, you lack the antibodies to deal with this stuff is a measured way.

                Best Jewish joke I ever heard was from an old Jewish guy in 90s.There’s a Chinese exchange student living with a Jewish family in America. The Chinese kid is from a very rural area so he doesn’t know practically anything about American culture. (Joke was told to me before the internet.) Anyway, Thanksgiving is coming up, so the Chinese kid asks  his Jewish host if Jews celebrate Thanksgiving.Haim thinks a bit and replies, Well, we celebrate the “Thanks” but not the “giving.”My Jewish friends love that joke but always tell me that they get in trouble with the women and younger guys when they say it at the Thanksgiving table. Jews won’t even tolerate Jewish jokes from other Jews anymore, at least not the younger ones. Sad.

                    My favorite is:  different religions have different points of view about when a human being becomes human.  For instance, with Catholics, it’s when the sperm meets the egg.  That’s why abortion is such a big matter to Catholics.  With Jews on the other hand, it’s when the individual receives their medical or legal degree….. womp

            I brought that up the other day.  I’ll gladly push back when someone actively discourages J-wokeness (see above), but the amount of “name the Jew” static Z was getting this week was too high-octane.  The JQ has a time and place.  Based on sheer volume lately I could look like a monomaniac but the Tribe’s been very newsworthy of late and very topical around here.  My own long-ass comments usually have less J-stuff than my replies b/c I’m more about pushing back than proselytizing.  We’re a pretty reality-based crowd on balance.  Most guys will get to our level sooner or later, and those who don’t are almost universally going to have to admit we’re right more often than not.  We don’t say “every single time” for no reason.

        Here’s a follow up on the local story of Tom’s Diner. The clip is worth watching for the obvious reason sitting on the right. The rest is drivel. It’s a reflection of how utterly incompetent a news organization is when, in story about attempting to designate a building as a landmark due to the architecture of the building, their news report lacks a single clear shot of the exterior of the sh!thole, er, I mean, building.Short story: application to designate building as landmark is withdrawn so this eyesore will probably see a wrecking ball and Tom will get to retire. The hookers and drug dealers who frequent Tom’s late at night will have to move to the East on Colfax. Sad days.https://kdvr.com/2019/08/15/group-withdraws-application-to-make-toms-diner-historic-landmark/The larger point you made about community in the podscast still stands. This is probably a good illustration of what happens when agitators push for actions that the community at large does not support, which is certainly something the dissident right needs to consider.

            That was the point I was making. Libertarians, whether they understand it or not, are arguing that people have no right to say what sort of society they want and have no right to set expectations for the community. The solution to the Tom’s diner issue is not standing on the sidelines shouting about property rights. It is countering the Left’s claims about what’s good for the community and offering a better vision.

            I lived in Denver from 1982 until 1985 and often went down Colfax Avenue since it lay between my office and my apartment/townhouse.  I remember it as pretty seedy, but I have no recollection of this diner.  I find that type of architecture as scarcely worthy of preservation.  At the same time, yet another apartment building with shops at the bottom strikes me as perpetuating a further architectural atrocity.  And the Capitol Hill area in Denver (its representative in Congress was Patricia Schroeder in the 1980s) is a neighborhood that probably doesn’t need more urban hipsters. Too bad both sides can’t lose!

                I wrote a comment about this area in Zman’s original post. Capitol Hill area has gentrified significantly, but is still seedy enough to give the white hipsters who have moved in the slight dopamine rush that results from the illusion of living in a gritty urban neighborhood. Downtown Denver has boomed in the last 20 years. Developers have driven the blacks and Hispanics east into Aurora and north into Westminster, Federal City, Commerce City, and Brighton. Lots of neighborhoods in Westminster now look like Tijuana. Great tacos, though.

                    I was in Denver this spring and went to a restaurant between downtown and the federal center to the west where they had to summon someone from the back who could take my order in English.  Nothing like the place that I moved to in 1982!

                    Guest said:  “Lots of neighborhoods in Westminster now look like Tijuana. Great tacos, though.” I grew up in Colorado Springs in the 1960s. And there were losts of mexicans and some blacks. And the town was never segregated from day one. So we all went to the same schools. Still most people lived with their own kind. So it wasn’t that big of deal because whites outnumbered color 8/2. Numbers, power and influence. that’s the problem.

                I lived in Denver up until 1975 and spent a lot of time there up through 1980. That was when it was a conservative, rural, White-dominated state. Wyoming with a bigger capital city. Good times.

                If you don’t like the new atrocity buy the land, pay off the politicians, and put up one of your own. I’m not buying Z’s story that it’s perfectly OK for shits to screw over local property owners in the name of “community”. This attempt may have failed, but it was a nuisance no one needed. And Jesse Jackson and his spawn are still rich.

            I am reminded of a similar architectural lawfare battle in mid-90s San Francisco.  St. Rose’s, a Catholic girls-only high school in tony Pacific Heights, suffered from declining enrollment and a building damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.  The anti-development forces sought a historical designation that would also have required a multi-million dollar seismic retrofit because the building was considered the ugliest design of a noted architect; and city denizens needed it to stand as a shining example of that gentleman’s entire ouvre from excellence to failure.  The supporters of ugliness lost.  The school was demolished.

                What it most strongly reminds me of is the Doggie Diner opposite the San Francisco Zoo. Note how the renditions of the proposed development incorporate the Tom’s Diner logo. This is remmiscent of the fate of the Doggie head, now moved to the mediian.

        I tend to harp on the JQ a lot. I don’t deny it. I will try to succinctly lay out my thoughts vis-à-vis ZMan’s strange soft spot for the Hebrew race.Most normies are dumb—lemmings as WLP called them. Grandpa Lampshade once laid it out well: people see things in B&amp;W. Zman’s big-brained nu’nce is lost on most of our people. If Jews want to play the foil to us, fine, fuck ‘em. 90% of them hate us for not hating our Whiteness. Sure, there are a lot of crappy roundhead anti-Whites who also need to be dealt with, but I’ll happily “scapegoat” a powerful group who openly hates us—Zman’s outliers notwithstanding.Trying to figure out who the few good Jews are is a waste of time and ultimately weakens the movement. It opens the door to Yoram Jabroni types who will steer Whites back towards “Israel first muh ebil Nazis” Zionist toolbaggery.Hitting the JQ hard is useful. When Jews feel threatened they overreact and expose their plans. “Oh, a lot of them are Gentiles” is a cuck cope. I welcome a (metaphorical) fight with traitor Whites without billionaire Jews who control the media backing up Elizabeth Warren types.

        I agree with the premise that we are headed for majority-minority status within our lifetime, and also that this will likely reignite tribalism within most identity groups (including Caucasians).You seem to believe that the best path forward is for whites to learn how to slug above their weight class (a la the Jews) in order to maximize advantage in the coming Brave New World. To me, that smacks of sloppy seconds at best and a replay of South Africa at worst. What’s wrong with using the ancestral traits endowed by our Northern European predecessors to once again ascend to the top of the pyramid, and then hopefully not repeat the mistakes of the past?

Bad bet because time would be working against us.

        One question I’d like to ask the JQ obsessed is why, after the long history of Western distrust of Jewish populations, from the Catholic Church (who, importantly, the Founding Fathers loathed), from Martin Luther, and from many other quarters of the West, was it suddenly decided to allow the Jews, among floods of other non-Anglo peoples from all over Europe, free entrance and free movement in America?  Whites had a long history of emphatically not being foolish and trusting toward Jews, yet this was largely detonated little more than a century after the founding of America.  It’s quite obvious what occurred.  The Jews became progressively viewed and treated as prescribed in the second sentence of the founding document of the country, the Declaration of Independence.There are elements within liberalism, within liberal democracy, free markets, individualism, and so on, that lead step by step to today.  The anti-liberal Right thinkers of the last two centuries and earlier (which encapsulates the overwhelming majority of philosophers in the pre-Enlightenment world) were, very often, correct.

                There were plenty before that, though, and the flood gates were opened in the late 19th century, as I understand it:“There have been Jewish communities in the United States since colonial times. Early Jewish communities were primarily Sephardi, composed of immigrants from Brazil and merchants who settled in cities. Until the 1830s, the Jewish community of Charleston, South Carolina, was the largest in North America. In the late 1800s and the beginning of the 1900s, many Jewish immigrants left from various nations to enter the U.S. as part of the general rise of immigration movements. For example, many German Jews arrived in the middle of the 19th century, established clothing stores in towns across the country, formed Reform synagogues, and were active in banking in New York. Immigration of Eastern Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, in 1880–1914, brought a large, poor, traditional element to New York City. They were Orthodox or Conservative in religion. They founded the Zionist movement in the United States, and were active supporters of the Socialist party and labor unions. Economically, they concentrated in the garment industry.”“None of the early migratory movements assumed the significance and volume of that from Russia and neighboring countries. Between the last two decades of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century, there was a mass emigration of Jewish peoples from Eastern and Southern Europe”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_StatesI suppose this was ALL just a product of Jewish machination, however.  If we just get rid of the Jews, we can go back to the 1950’s, and I guess just pray that those innocent goyim don’t get tricked again by Jews from abroad, into once again sacrificing their civilization and their offspring’s future.

        Day late and a dollar short – whatever.How many times do you say anti-semite ? Was it like a hundred or something ? Didn’t bother counting, but had the same effect as hissing “racism”.How does acknowledging the obvious equal “anti-semite”  ?It’s funny how we have no problem talking about blacks and their negative effect on society yet never acknowledge the fact that jews use them against whites all the time.Have personally seen them sell out their neighborhoods to blacks destroying the area and launching massive amounts of white flight.Then give them home loans even though they’re working at McDonald’s. Of  course anyone with the sane mind couldn’t object because “racism”And now every damn commercial is some black guy with a white woman.Who owns the banks ?  Who owns advertising ?  Who owns Hollywood ?There’s an old Irish saying Z-man .  Don’t piss on my back and tell me it’s raining.I like the intelligence you bring to the conversation. Being a Jewish cheerleader isn’t one of them.Oh and thanks for giving the President some credit for taking on China.Always worry you going to de-cloke and do a “glen beck” never trumper loon.Carry on !

        Z, you said something to the effect that the jews are clannish, but they’re so successful because they cut loose group members who are bad for the jews.  But look at the ADL.  When Leo Frank raped and murdered Mary Phagan, jews from around the country moved heaven and earth to defend him.  Contemporary accounts show that many of these jews personally disliked him.  Yet they amassed vast sums of cash for his defense.  They even leveraged political power to have his sentence commuted.  To this day, the ADL is still out there doing everything in its power to make circumstances favorable for jews.  And all this to defend a pedophile murderer.Can you imagine any other group on the planet pulling something like that?

            Don’t confuse anti-Semite mythology with reality. Leo Frank was dragged from his cell and hanged. That’s what elicited the response from the Jewish community. It was not just Jews unhappy with that either. There’s never been much support for lynch mobs and by that point the general public was squarely opposed to them.
As to your question, Italians were sure Sacco and Vanzetti were framed into the 1980’s.

                He was lynched because his sentence was commuted.  He was found guilty of the crime *twice*.  It wasn’t like they lynched him prior to due process because they hated jews.  They lynched him because he was to be spared his proper punishment due to jewish pressure.  And the people who lynched him were never brought to “justice,” because everyone agreed it was the proper response.  The issue had nothing to do with antisemitism.
But why were jews from all around the country fundraising for his defense in the first place?  They had no reason to believe he was innocent.

thezman. Was talking about the chain of causation and how Civilization may be changing us as a species. Well, here’s a few things to think about.
Here’s an artical intitled: “Civilization is Anti-Human, Not Machines.”https://medium.com/a-passion-to-evolve/civilizations-anti-human-not-machines-1d84cdb8a7a3
Here’s a Youtube vid I’ve posted before called “The Mouse Utopia Experiments.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgGLFozNM2o

            Modern civilization is Procrustean in nature. You either let it shape you into what it needs or you’re finished.
That means you are little more than a goose stuck in a veal fattening pen for the next 40 years in a job you hate with no future until your health gives out and you die because you have no time to eat right or exercise properly because of the demands of the job.
The very fact that people don’t rebel and burn the entire f**king system down is beyond me.

        Assuming North Korea can open up, I don’t think they are going to quickly join their Asian neighbors in functionality.  The vast majority of people in North Korea suffer chronic starvation. North Koreans are substantially shorter and lighter than South Koreans. It’s not a little bit.  They are probably 10 IQ points or more lower than South Korea.Then there was the mass starvation in the 90s.  Just think of all of the adults today in North Korea who were children in the 90s when they were eating grass. These would be worse than crack babies. Just about every 20-30 year old today in NK were eating grass as a main foodstuff as children. This is aside from the regular day-to-day food shortages and chronic starvation. The best seeds in the world will not grow in terrible soil.They are also heavily brainwashed and poorly educated.It will probably take 40 years or longer for North Korea to begin to catch up. 40 years allows for 2 generations. The first generation are going to be born by women who have chronic starvation. It will be the children’s children who were not born to women suffering 20 or more years of chronic starvation. So when the grandchildren of the freed people begin to leave school, that is when you will get fast growth to South Korean standards.I would also imagine that a lot of South Koreans will want to go into the North for opportunities in the North with brand new open markets. That would help North Korea a lot in the early days of ending North Korean communism or whatever it is.

            Here’s what wikipedia states about South Korea’s immigration policies:“Although immigration to South Korea is low due to strict immigration policies, it is on the rise.”“The South Korean Government says it wants to create a multicultural society and foreigner-friendly environment.”“In 2007 the UN declared Korea an official receiving country. The number of foreigners in South Korea grew from 390,000 in 1997 to 1 million in 2007. Among these are 630,000 temporary laborers, as well as 100,000 foreigners married to South Korean nationals. Furthermore, there are 230,000 illegal immigrants.“Main sending countries are Asian countries, such as China, Vietnam, Mongolia, the Philippines, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. However, migrants also come from Nigeria, Ghana, Russia, and the United States.”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_South_Korea#Recent_historyHere’s what it states about women in South Korea:“Women in South Korea have experienced significant improvements for social changes in recent years, compared to previous times, when Confucianism was deeply imbued in the culture.  …gender roles and gender identities eventually have been modified as a result to changing modernity.[5] More than half of Korean women are employed and furthermore, more than 25% of married women are employed as full-time workers. In politics, although there are not as many female politicians as male politicians, the female politicians have recently begun to participate more actively than in the past. For instance, in the National Assembly, women occupy 20 of the 299 seats.”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_South_KoreaYou can see them beginning to crack already.  Western style structure, liberal democratic capitalism, brings with it social and cultural trends, which include low fertility, feminism, family breakdown, materialist/hedonist mass culture, so on.  Global corporations want open markets, businesses of all sizes want cheap labor, and liberal democratic elites become merged with business elites, shifting back and forth in public and private employment.  Liberal democratic politicians want campaign donations and support from the wealthy and powerful, who are none other than the business elite.This system and the trends it carries with it is only spreading.  Men like Fukuyama and Kojeve were not absurd to predict that this system would ultimately envelop the earth.  It is, quite simply, a nightmarish disaster.I pray that North Korea does not fall to what has already laid the foundation for the destruction of the West (with, notably, the former Soviet Bloc the least decayed, the most resistant to immigration, the most resistant to social and cultural degeneracy).

                As bad as America is, it is a paradise on Earth compared to North Korea.  If you commit wrong-think in NK, not only are you going to a concentration camp (or killed) for life, but so are your parents and children.To say that this is preferable to immigrants is just insane.I am not talking about opening up Korea to the world, I am talking opening up the North to other Koreans from the South. It’s not really immigration so much as it is moving. I would expect the North and South to be reunited as one political entity.

                    It depends on one’s point of view.  If one is highly, highly pessimistic about where all this is ultimately going, as I am, while others are not, then there are going to be disagreements.  If we are talking about the long-run health of a people, about the long-run existence of Korea/Koreans as a distinct people with belonging, traditions, connection to ancestors and posterity, etc., then I hope that North Korea does not simply embrace liberalism.  The example of the old Soviet Bloc tells me that there is a greater potentiality for development into sane and healthy culture, society, institutions, etc. via breaking out of communism than there is via breaking out of liberalism.  “Communism kills the body, but liberalism rots the soul.”I highly recommend this essay for another example of the power of liberalism to rot a people away mentally and spiritually:https://nationalparty.ie/embarrassed-to-be-irish-then-prepare-to-be-nothing/“The Irish are a race who are in the process of discarding their entire practical and theoretical existence, not out of duress or necessity but seemingly out of conformity. Even a sentence that begins with “The Irish are a race” will cause them now to cringe with embarrassment, apologise to the ubiquitous foreigner in the room, and change the subject. Probably click off this page and move as quickly as possible onto something more digestible. Yet it was a perfectly ordinary phrase only a few short years ago.”“Never did a country run so blindly into the full blown narcissism of consumer capitalism, discard so quickly the scaffolding of religion and tradition, which for most of mankind is the flawed but necessary basis of social order, and then crash headlong into staggering economic servitude. A decade or more later, Ireland is a corporate zombie nation with strange new corporate religions, flags, symbols, rites. And to top it all, a kind of collective amnesia about exactly what has happened to us. Modern Ireland is a perpetual present. And the memory of the past is treated with the awkwardness of a drunken blackout. Something to be forgotten and suppressed in the urgency of the moment.”

                        But the choices aren’t ‘full globohomo’ or NK grade communism.There are no Asian countries that even approach America or Ireland in terms of globohomo.Aside from immigration, globohomo can be turned around quite easily. Liberal insanity could not survive a few years of mass starvation and million people dead from said starvation a year.  When times are tough, who do you think will be fed, a 16yo young woman or a 16yo boy who thinks he is a woman?  A large family with deep local roots are far more likely to survive bad times than a family full of homosexuals, wamen and trannies who have fled to NYC, each by themselves on a quest to “find themselves” and other such nonsense.Given all the dysfunction of liberalism, I think liberalism may be the cure for liberalism.

            They have their own internal disputes.  Notice that they keep them“in the family” and will raise hell if a goy sticks his nose in too far.  Don’t let the exception disprove the rule.  Shitlibs leverage that on race realists to claim that “my smart nice Black friend” means “forced bussing or jail, bigots!”  or “I love tacos” = “open the border and rape my daughter.” Wedge issues and internecine disputes exist among Jews, of course, but on average they tend to keep their eyes on “what’s good for the Jews” in the process.  As Z has pointed out before, there’s a segment of the Jewish power elite that’s wise enough to know that Michelle Goldberg and Noah Rothman types crowing about our demise isn’t good and they’re trying to turn the volume down.  Epstein’s likely another example of intra-tribal infighting as I noted yesterday.

Exactly where have you seen this opinion expressed that non-Jews shouldn’t opine on whether Israel should keep the two out?
I suppose someone must have said that it’s Israel’s business and you should mind your own, but I doubt anyone saying so will give American Jews a pass.

Exceptions aren’t the rule. There are always children saying stupid stuff. That doesn’t mean the adults listen to them. The Jewish community isn’t 100% monolithic, but its leaders keep moving the West in a direction they want, not what a few screaming Jewesses want.

        @thezman.  According to the “Jewish virtual library.” In 2018 there were around 14,606,000 Jews on planet Earth.   According to the “Pareto principle” 20% of those Jews would be running everything in one way or the other. That’s a grand total of 292,120,00 Jews that have the entire humen race by the throat. Holy Crap! Can you imagine how busy those basterds are? Can you imagine the executive burnout? They would be having a 100 heart attacks a day.

            That’s the problem with Magic Jew Theory™. If Jews really are controlling the world, despite being a rounding error population-wise, it’s best not to piss them off. Alternatively, if the issue is whites allowing themselves to be bullied and coerced, that’s correctable. It’s also more difficult than exploring the world of Magic Jew Theory™.

                Why can’t it be a little of both?
Obviously if Jews were magically powerful, they’d be running Japan as well while making deep inroads into China’s power structure. That said, it’s simply disingenuous to claim that people are crazy to say that Jews dominate the media and academia in the United States, though that may be slipping a bit.

                    Japan and China employ a tight ethnic/racial test to access to power.  This is an apples-and-oranges comparison.
Little bit of both seems reasonable to me, BTW.

                        My point was that Jews aren’t magical. If they were, they’d figure out a way to get around Japan and China’s ethnic/racial test.
But I will agree that Jews benefit mightily be “looking” white. What’s more, I don’t think that Jews understand how important that is. Indians and Asians will never see a Jew as one of their own, and that matters. Every time they look at a Jew they are reminded that he’s not one of them and can never be fully trusted. That’s not true for whites.

                            Beyond the visual, normie Americans are bludgeoned into believing that “everyone gets a shot”.  Asian cultures (for that matter, pretty much all non-white cultures) don’t fall for that.   If you don’t fit the right profile, hit the road.  If other cultures hobbled themselves in the same ways we do, there would at least be some sort of competitive equilibrium.  As it is, whitey plays with one arm tied behind his back.

                            Jews don’t “look white”. They ARE white. If you “look white” you are white. If you want to exclude Jews you need a different word. Otherwuise the word for you is “loon”.

Rosanna freaking Arquette knows she’s not white and thinks it’s important that you do to.  There are 1000’s more “fellow white people/I’m Jewish” examples all over the internet.

                                Watch a panicked flock of sheep. The ones who are the most panicked get out in front and make a lot of noise, attracting the other sheep to follow them. I think that largely explains leftarded Jews voting against their own interests — they’re more panicked by social changes, so are acting more like panicked sheep — get out in front and run even faster, even if that’s toward the cliff, because otherwise OMG the wolves will get us! Prey animal instinct come to the fore.

                        Apparently, since the ones moaning don’t seem to notice that Orthodox Jews are mostly conservative (including a couple of adamantly pro-2A outfits). Most leftarded Jews are either Reform or secular. Unfortunately the latter are also the noisy ones who tend to go into politics and journalism (using the term loosely).
One could draw a parallel: traditional Christians are mostly conservative, and you don’t hear much from them; ‘reform’ and secular Christians are mostly leftards who want to run the show and never shut up.
One could point out a further parallel regarding loss of roots and loss of moral compass.

                    I agree, a little bit of both. Z Man has not mentioned Christian Zionism much in his JQ discussions but my thoughts are that especially in Protestantism where the Scofield Bible and the Falwell types roam the nation Jews have had a hay day of success maintaining their “chosen people” image. Which they have leveraged into societal and political power here in America.Christian Zionists in America have been a huge contributor to the Jew bogeyman on our shores. I do however agree with the Z Man and in my own way I try not to spend a tremendous amount of energy focusing on the JQ.

            I’ll keep saying this until I’m Jew in the face…“Jews control the world” is a straw man 95% of us don’t subscribe to.Try saying “Blacks don’t have the numbers to commit every crime on Earth, so stop whining and let them all out of jail already” with a straight face.Hatefact: a large section of world Jewry exercises vastly disproportionate political, cultural and economic influence for their own community advantage.  Those Jews have seized the Jewish megaphone and the rest of not-world-controlling Jewry acts like the “vast majority of peaceful Muslims” in letting them do it.Hatefact:  this group of Jews has been the principal intellectual, financial and cultural force behind globohomo anti-Whiteness (thus “globoshlomo”) for decades.Stop trying to snark away the ugly truth with “Freakonomics”-tier half-truths and smearing people who’re working honestly for the best interests of White people.

                We have a number of big problems but if I had to name the most significant:. An ethnic group that sees whites as dangerous exerts controlling influence over most of our institutions and their main weapon is subversion of the gullible and instinctual compassion of whites.

                    This is the point of my comment elsewhere. I focus on Jews a fair amount because they’re our main impediment to reaching our goals. If blacks were the main impediment, I’d focus on them. If Indians were our main impediment, I’d focus on them.Z keeps saying that people who focus too much on Jews have some mental issue. That’s like saying that a pitcher is crazy because he focuses to much on the batter at the plate.The pitcher doesn’t hate the batter, nor does he ascribe evil genetics to the the batter. The batter is simply his main problem at the moment.

                        You are grossly mischaracterizing my position. I was pretty clear that the people who obsess about Jews are a small club. To use your analogy, these are pitchers who are sure the opposing batters use mind waves to control the umpire.

                            Alright, I’ll concede on that one.But there is often the implication that people who focus a lot on the Jewish community are motivated by some unhinged view of Jews or Jewish power, even if they don’t claim magical powers.Like it or not, powerful Jews really are the biggest impediment to whites thinking as a group. You don’t have to be crazy to focus on your main problem.Btw, how we got to this point can be debated, but that discussion should involve a lot of soul searching among whites because we let it happen. Jews aren’t running Japan. Whites lost something along the way, and we have no one to blame for that but ourselves.

Your fashionable skeptique “above it all” pose may score Internet Points but it doesn’t help anyone “take the world back.”
Take it back from who, BTW?  Might be useful to have some clarity on that question.  That’s harder when we have to spend time clarifying snarky contrarian nonsense takes about the numbers of world Jewry instead of focusing on the opposition.

                        Actually, I did listen to the segment, but doing so is irrelevant to my comment on your “working as a team” claim, which is just a stupid characterization of the activities of the  “historical preservation” pests, one that doesn’t even rise to the level of “inane”.

        I hope you guys know you are considered ignorant and evil. The people reject you. Consider the following facts:1. Trump will lose2. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is ripping it up and has republicans running scared.3. Deplatforming of right wingers continues to happen everyday.4. Most young people are People of Color5. Islam is growing and getting respect.6. Christian supremacy is getting criticized7. Most white people are old and dying off8. White birth rates are low9. White girls are increasingly having Children of Color with Men of Color10. Open borders immigration is about to be a realityDarn it feels good to be a progressive

1. No2. No3. Most of those platforms will crash as a result4. Cattle cars and death marches will fix that5. Joos will take care of that6. With collapsing families, communities and nations as a result7. See above8. PoC population curves will take care of that9. Look at their divorce stats. Burn the coal, pay the toll10. See 5. This isn’t over yet.
