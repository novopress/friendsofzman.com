        It’s more of an ethnically motivated conspiracy.The folks who came to Ellis Island in the 19th century had a lot of problems.even fascism and nazism in Europe would be overwhelmed by what they have achieved.

        Whewee. No-one reads this far down the comments. However I don’t buy Z’s bland dismissal of deeper conspiracies, because for one thing they don’t reckon with the institutionalized tradecraft of the letter agencies in creating narratives and deception. This is something the world has never seen before, deep pockets, scientific research and secrecy in propagandising the nation and the world. For example, they supplied advisors to the x-files to plant certain story lines, on the scientifically proven basis that if audiences have seen this weird, out-there and obviously fictionalized story about a nefarious government, they will not believe that it can happen in real life. And it works. Zman for one believes that mysterious men in smoke filled rooms cannot exist, because he saw it while crunching popcorn and kicking it with his buds in a fun tv show in 1995.

            We now know that Garland signed off on the raid, so…yes, it was the Deep State, or whatever you want to call it. They’re even spreading the rumor that Trump took “nuclear codes” with him from the White House. So don’t be surprised if something like that is “found” among the things the FBI took away from Mar-a-Lago. The FBI is famous for planting evidence.

                My reaction to the Garland presser was that he was lying. He did not sign off on it in advance. He was sent out to give that presser in response to the very negative public reaction. For some reason, no one notices that Garland is asleep at the wheel. His public utterances sound like he is on drugs or suffering from cognitive decline.If he was on top of this, why have the warrant signed by an obscure local judge rather than a DC judge? Why have the op run by the local field office? This is not normal operating procedure for an investigation running out of DC. The Washington office runs the operation top to bottom.I doubt we ever get the documents. We are still waiting on the Feds to release stuff from the Clinton years. The FBI answers to no one.

                    The “we were looking for “NUCLEAR Secrets” is clearly so patently ridiculous that  it boggles the mind. What exactly are nuclear secrets?  ho to build a device – nope common knowledge already. if north Korea can do it , anybody can. is it who has them , nope , public knowledge. where they are? pretty much common knowledge since the advent of satellites.A dangerous sounding term that really dumb people will believe? probably

                    Obviously he was lying about the DOJ and FBI protecting citizens’ rights, being fair and impartial, having ethics, saving us from domestic terror plots (since the FBI creates them), having any integrity, etc.  The one thing he probably did not lie about was approving the warrant.

                Question: my security system at home allows me to reprogram my security password/code rather easily, so wouldn’t it be prudent to change the nuclear codes periodically,  and at least on a change of administration,  you know, for NUCLEAR WEAPONS???

        Although, speaking for myself, I’m still hoping for it turn out it’s lizard people or 5th dimensional aliens, sadly the reality is rather more prosaic and available in detail on the UN and WEF website. There is a global conspiracy for a New World Order and it’s all out in plain sight and major government leaders continually make speeches about it. You can find lists of companies and people involved on the official websites.

        So we tend to personalize things?(*Looks at Bible.*)
Of course.  That’s the first and most important lesson we learn before we can speak.  It’s an intuitive shorthand.
Thanks, Z.  This really helps.  I get so wrapped up in my personal mission it bleeds onto these pages.  My approach is wrong, I’m driving away readers and trashing my favorite bar.  Gotta cool it.

        I have 2 questions. Maybe this will help settle the perennial topic here as to whether or not there is a deep state, or a cabal.Who is it who says we will have electric cars whether we like it or not, we have no say in it, and if you don’t like it, tough sh!t?The second question is, who is it that keeps talking about us peons are gonna have to learn how to eat bugs to save the Earth? They’re even putting up famous actresses showing us how to eat bugs. So who is it who’s behind it?

            Both of which are being imposed across the entire western world (US/Canada/Aus/N\/UK/EU) despite exactly no one voting for them and intentionally being used to make a shit existence for the said citizens
Huge amount of Legislative preparation and bills passed for years in place to bring it about, supra-national policy groups and working parties outside representative voting, state funded NGOs and administrative depts created and staffed to enforce the surrounding rules.
Yeah pretty much seems like it meets the definition of a large coordinated conspiracy.

                I notice no one posted anything right here saying there is no cabal or deep state. I myself think there is a group behind the scenes running the show. We have all of these media organs telling us what we’re going to have to do but the movers and shakers tend not to show their faces. It all sounds like a deep state to me, who takes their orders from higher-ups. All we need to know is who owns the banks, and from whom the politicians get their dineros from and then deposited into their private accounts.

                    There is no cabal or deep state as envisaged.There you go. I was just tired of saying it.Certainly there are cliques and opportunistic machinations, but a true deep state in the US? No. It’s far easier to believe that people are just paranoid and insecure and will believe anything, because we have solid evidence for that.

                        But the point is that whether there is a tangible DS or not, the result will be the same. They want us dead. Do you think that when this happens, it will matter to us whether it was those guys in Room 46 of the WEF building or just a loose bunch of interests and coincidences that did us in?

            I guess the terms cabal or deep state may be throwing some off a bit making it sound more formal than it is.  Maybe more a cartel or club. But there does appear to be some group of like-minded folks  at the top “setting the tone” so to speak with enough formal or informal control over various institutions to get that tone adopted by enough power players, and then it trickles down to the npc level.

        For the most part I like your comments. But after a time of reading your posts I find a pattern that can only be explained by you using an AI program to help you complete your posts. Regarding this post, how do explain this fine human, the DOJ AG in his actions and announcements? Just another little bad actor? Call it what you want. There is clearly an us against them here.

                The more power you wield, the less intelligence it takes to get things done. 2020 election fraud is a perfect example – no sophisticated skullduggary needed.  Just stuff boxes to your hearts content, kick out/block observers, pause proceedings,  etc. all pretty much in the open if not on live tv..

        The Deep State is the result of two crossing phenomena, which also explain the weirdness and seeming stupidity of our masters.The first is the hereditary nature of the rulers, which is well known, and their passing along of positions as best they can in the hierarchy, which most especially includes NGOS, federal bureaucracy, as well as politics which is better known.The second less well known is that as MANAGERS they OWN NOTHING. And have great insecurity. It is why Pelosi, Schumer, McConnell, Fauci, Biden etc. all in their 80s or very near it won’t retire. Their power, their wealth, is all based on continuing as manager not as owner. Mencius Moldbug may be long winded, but he has that right. There was a site about Hollywood running during the Bush years, and the guy pointed out that the lack of profit maximizing in favor of proto-woke garbage was a function of managers looking to build their social network not owners seeking maximum profit. A king or dictator seeks to maximize his power and wealth, while a manager seeks to insulate themselves from removal.This is also why our rulers are so weird: promoting offputting sexual deviance at every turn, as well as “all White women belong to blacks and White man the only woman you will get is Lizzo” which is an inducement to revolt, along with the mega one of “we will take away everything you own and force you to eat bugs.”A king, a dictator, would see this as incitement to another Sepoy Mutiny and have executed any court adviser behind such a scheme seeing it clearly as a danger to himself. Managers don’t care, and figure placating the woke weirdos around them is the smart move. And its a dumb move because they themselves were selected for being part of the dynastic clan they belong to — being in most cases second or third generation. Consider Putin and Xi — they had to navigate through extremely ruthless enemies like Bo Xilai or the Russian Oligarchs, they were selected for Darwinian ruthlessness, cunning, and awareness of reality. Consider Gavin Newsom, Justin Trudeau, Cynthia Freeland, Liz Truss, Chris Wray. They were selected for being born to the right family. Without having to prove themselves as aristocrats of yore in war, colonial exploration, trade, administration, etc.Our ruling elite in the FBI, the White House Admin, various NGOs etc. are all managers not owners and insecure, thus they MUST have ordinary people eating bugs, otherwise in the words of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy and her horror at seeing her servants cars at her private chapel: “What is the point of being rich if ordinary people have nice things too?” Fauci and Wray can only be important if only THEY eat fish, chicken, beef and pork, and everyone else eats bugs.Whereas Putin knows he’s the Czar, he is the Czar of All the Russians, he knows it, everyone else knows it, he needs only to guard his person not his social standing. And he’s been selected for by ruthless cunning, not being the feckless son of some third-rate dynast.

            Whisky, your conjecture is highly persuasive. The first thought that enters my mind after reading it is “If the managers have so little stake in the system, nor true power to defend it, doesn’t that make them easy prey for [unknown predator(s)]?”

            In other words, they are the usual mix of effeminate eunuchs and demented psychopaths who are always to be found when a regime is in its final throes. What I find fascinating is how completely interchangeable they all are: Truss/Trudeau/Macron/that turd in NZ…No personality, never held a real job, crappy educational histories, etc.

        Once again, the Deep State is NOT a “secret group of hidden actors.” The Deep State = Media and celebrities + Govt + Organized Crime. The names of all these people are well known (especially “celebrities”). The origin of the term is:“The Susurluk scandal developed after a car accident on 3 November 1996 near Susurluk in Balıkesir province. In this accident, former Deputy Chief of Istanbul Police Hüseyin Kocadağ, the leader of the Grey Wolves (Nationalist Action Party’s youth organization) Abdullah Çatlı, and a woman named Gonca Us  [Turkish supermodel] died; DYP Şanlıurfa MP Sedat Bucak, who was also the leader of a large group of village guards in Siverek, was injured. This coalition exposed the connections between the security forces, politicians and organized crime, and led to the resignation of interior minister Mehmet Ağar of the True Path Party.”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_Turkey#Susurluk_scandalPlease note the word “exposed”.

            I tend to agree, Hun.  While the lowlife may have hatched the idea, this antic is such a monumental road marker in the formerly normal operation of the Republic, that instinctively this judge would know to get it cleared from the higher ups. To protect himself and be assured of “good standing” in spite of any backlash.This feels like a major turning point. JFK was shocking (and the consequences very drawn out) and the 60s were annoyingly wild. But neither felt like the sign of irreplaceable rot in the internal machinery –  unlike the glee with which the Waco people were incinerated. I remember thinking that any society that can do that is on borrowed time.The 60s became so chaotic, for so long, that it got to the point where nothing felt surprising. Vassar and some other schools had black militants shooting rifles from dorms they took over (no one bellyached about it). About the only thing that was eyebrow raising was seeing the NG with a machine gun planted on sandbags just outside Newark city limits. It went on for so long that each escalation had less impact. It didn’t seem “evil” in the way Waco was.Looking back, it was pretty remarkable that it didn’t all melt down. But then, we still had a shared culture that (generally) people agreed upon and felt they had some stake in. This judge lived through all that and knew full well that there is no going back. He got his green light and a cookie too.

                “unlike the glee with which the Waco people were incinerated. I remember thinking that any society that can do that is on borrowed time”That also is my marker, and was the first time I truly appreciated how dishonest and evil the propaganda organs are; NBC had a made-for-TV, total bullshit movie rushed into production that might as well had presented the Davidians as Satan incarnate (it would have been more subtle). The cucks weren’t quite as cucky then, but ZOG immediately shut down a congressional attempt to get to probe the massacre. It was obvious at that point the National Security State wielded absolute, unfettered power.Another marker was when Madeleine Albright, who is now roasting in Hell, claimed the deaths of half a million Iraqi children during food sanctions was totes worth it. The number of murdered Arabs would end up in the millions.It was only a matter of time before domestic genocide would be unleashed when that became the prevailing attitude. My guess is that as the GAE becomes even weaker and more discredited, it will focus on the annihilation of people who aren’t our types, dear. Mark 8/8. It was the end of the beginning.

        “The deep state may simply be a sign that the system is in severe decline and nearing collapse.”I agree with both of those suppositions, but the question remains: WHEN?Look up a picture / statue of the Roman emperor Diocletian vs. the empress Zoe or Basil II ~800 years later.  The best images of the later look like they were done by 3rd graders.  “Severe decline” indeed.Decline and senescence come for all men and all societies.  The hardest thing is that I was born into a country that had men walking on the moon and harnessing the atom for energy.Now, my son’s are second class citizens and get “Hate has no home here” signs, gay sex month and Juneteemph.

        Almost every single ad removes the white man. Those that do not remove him show him in a couple with a black or brown woman with mixed race children.This occurred immediately overnight after St. George had his Holy Overdose.I just got an advertisement interrupting my YT Scriabin playlist for a new curriculum focused on AP History courses for teachers. It has the standard globo homo imagery. Chinese, Jewish and Middle Eastern court scenes plus Aunt Jamima; and a painting featuring a nude white woman appearing as an angel in the midst of a naval battle. The White man and Western Civ have gone missing. They have a specialized course in getting to Net Zero by 2050 using statistics and data.This is all in lockstep. This happened overnight but it takes years to prepare these materials and coordinate this effort. This is a part of the Globalist agenda – The Great Reset; The New err … Liberal World Order.This is political messaging and it doesn’t just happen spontaneously and it is always intentional. The purging of James Lindsey, the suing of Alex Jones, the latest harassment of Donald Trump all within days of each other. The ceaseless, consistent imagery. Is it random and spontaneous? Maybe.The bottom line is this. A bunch of hugely powerful forces are conspiring against us and our progeny. Whether it is all a big happy accident or a highly centralized and organized plot doesn’t matter. We need to conspire and we need to plot, or this bulldozer is going to bury us. What is going on besides blogging? I feel like all I am doing is proving my impotence with every word I type into a web form.

            My issue with the complaints of airbrushing white men out of ads (to be clear, it’s irksome and pathetically obvious) is treating it as an arduous strategy, like Gramsci’s long march, instead of mere fashion. Vaccines and cyberbullying laws also come to mind. These activists have no plan, they are acting busy.We inhabit a woman-dominated consumer society of pro-social happy-thoughts morality. The feminine scapegoating of mustache-twirlers is not the stuff of a Sun Tzu meme, we see it commonly because it’s “good enough for government work.” Ironically women will awaken to meritocracy/stringent standards when they log into Zoom and see the freak teach-goblin with nose rings waving marital aids at the captive audience. In a consumer context they suddenly remember that results matter.

            The Passion of St. George was an accellerant of processes that took root in the late-60s. If you observe advertisements from that period, you will see nuggras creeping into the picture. The present madness has been gestating for over half a century.

            For several days on Zero Hedge, I think it was, one of the ads was for (I think) a moving or storage service. The still is of a smiling Negro carrying a box with an approving White woman nearby. It occurs to me that this is clever advertising: the messaging is ambiguous; it can be taken as the Progressive dream of a bi-racial couple, or (given the conservative audience) the man is the worker just offloading the goods to the white lady.

        Many years before Katrina, the Smoking Man was shown to be nominally in charge of FEMA, which a character in the first X-Files movie referred to as “the secret government”.  In the show’s mythology, when the aliens finally showed up to colonize the earth, a state of emergency would be declared and FEMA would take control of the US.

            It’s a good plot-line. FEMA has resources stashed around the country, is known to move in fairly quickly, and is generally not held in much suspicion by the public at large. They are also given the local credibility as they cannot actually move in until they have been requested by the states’ Governors.

        What I find the most interesting is trying to use associations to suss out what’s going on. Like those maps people make with constellations and various nodes linking them together are really cool.One guy to do a deep dive on would be David bazelon. He’s a long forgotten name but he was appointed to the DC circuit in 1949 became chief judge in 1962 and   remained chief until he took senior status during the Carter era. He was widely scene as sort of a wizard of oz figure who was the “tenth justice” during the warren court era. He also apparently was the first judge to issue a nationwide injunction.His associations are even more interesting. Two of his granddaughters are well known for being journalists/activists. There’s also his activity before he became a judge. I think he was involved with the mafia, the pritzker family and I remember hearing he basically swindled interned Japanese Americans out of there property/business.

            Murray Rothbard has a lot of analysis on this phenomenon. A lot of it is centered around the beginning decades of the Progressive Era. A major journalist pushing muckrakers who is the brother-in-law of the meat packing industry that is tired of upstart rivals and wants them, “regulated.”He gets pretty extensive. One thing about this is that the brother-in-law doesn’t have to be in on anything. You just mention an outrage at dinner and he develops a passion for solving a great injustice. The legislation gets passed and when the champagne is broken on the bow of the brother-in-law’s new yacht and you are on the first world wide voyage in it you saved the poor wretches and life is better than ever to boot. Of course, a century plus of do-gooder cost increases and inefficiencies later, and things are starting to unravel. Time to get angry at the grandchildren of the people your grandfather wanted so desperately to help.Welcome to the degenerate phase of Progressivism.

            Krusty, I have a book at home that goes into depth about this guy. I’m going to find it and read that part of it again. That guy was a mob lawyer for Capone in Chicago, moved to CA and gained more influence and power there. He was responsible for the confiscation and sale to his fellow mobsters the assets of imprisoned Japanese Americans during the war. A lot of the businesses and properties were sold at 10 cents on the dollar or less I believe.After all that he was put up for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, second only to the Supremes in power, despite no judicial experience and basically no legal experience. He had always been a fixer not an attorney. In the court he pushed gun control and everything else that would cause chaos in the country. The author wondered if he did this to take attention away from the outfit.I can’t remember who wrote the book, it was the second volume of his history of organized crime. The first covered the Capone machine in Chicago and through the midwest and south. They were interesting reading.

            On a related (?) theme, I learnt today that the judge who issued the Trump warrant is basically a contractor. They are normal in the Federal judiciary, but the problem is they escape the Senate confirmation  process. (Search on “insight” to get to the relevant section)

        LOL“Greetings fellow chitpoaters and dissidents? You can buy the “Defund the FBI” Tee Shirts and hats at my website!”Z you must either chit or get off the pot. A rogue FBI flunky? Deciding to make a splash by raiding a former US president? And a random lunatic judge? Please – let us have some honesty and clarity. The judge in this case represented Epstein in his pedophilia case. The client list was made to go away by the entire judicial class. What are there never random lunatic judges that go the other way? You would think at least one would demand  an immediate investigation and explanation for that, wouldn’t you? And again when Epstein himself went away – you’d think at least one rogue judge would have had a problem with that too…? But perps investigated themselves (you’d think a random judge somewhere would have a problem with that too) – and the whole thing was sewn up and filed within days. You’d think at least a couple rogue  inspectors would object and move in an official capacity against stuff like this?But no, it’s all a series of random burps produced by a failing system. Pull my other finger – it has bells on it. Hell’s bells – the supremes overturned Roe vs Wade and then had to dodge organized mobs!And how, exactly, does constitutional law allow for these abuses? Don’t be ridiculous – constitutional law has to be subverted in order for any of this crap to fly – and not by random flunkies among the dirt people… it has to happen at the highest levels of govt.When the original X-Files was made, most of us laughed at conspiracy theory. It was fun way to look at UFOs, mad scientists, time travellers and such. Todays viable conspiracy theorists are have been knocking them out of the park with boring consistency, lately..I say there IS a deep state and a goodly amount of blood and guts will be spilled in order to rip it out in the next civil war.

        I even read a post somewhere with a guy claiming that Trump no really super-secretly set it all up to out a mole in his camp, and now that Trump knows the mole he can, I dont know, cross the rubicon? Give me a break. Even after all this happened people still cannot come to grips with the idea that, maybe just maybe, the federal government is run by people who just hate Trump that much and are doing everything they can to destroy him, and they can do a lot. FWIW the FBI is out there bragging about how they had a mole in his camp. So much for that idea.A lot of normies/grillers cannot come to grips with the idea that we are ruled by stupid, violent, incompetent, hateful people who don’t know what they are doing. These are people who came up in the system that the normie loves so much, which means the system has been rotten for the normie’s whole life, and beyond that. After a while the system started selecting for stupid, violent, incompetent, and hateful people, and everything just turned to autopilot. Here we are now.

        One of the many remarkable aspects of Christianity when brought to the Celtic people, was the new concept that the world was not random and controlled by a cabal of angry gods. St. Patrick was instrumental in fostering the belief that the world was entirely the christian God’s. This does not, however, preclude us from misfortune or suffering or the works of evil men but it does strengthen our resolve to know that there is a plan.

        Sometimes conspiracy theories happen by accident.  The fact that the judge in this case represented Epstein was an amazing coincidence.  This judge had a law practice in Palm Beach, and is one of the chosen people. That drastically increases the odds of having represented Epstein.  Sometimes you do have amazing coincidences.Epstein was an X Files character out of central casting.  The FBI couldn’t find a worse person in Florida to have signed this warrant, conspiracy theory wise.  In an additional twist the judge recused himself in the Trump vs. Clinton lawsuit as he thought it was too politically sensitive at his level. That lawsuit would have never come across the desk of some judge in Nebraska, but, living in Trump’s jurisdiction, it happened.These coincidences prove that God’s sense of humor is one of macabre irony.  He is an author, writing a cosmic best seller, with all kinds of twists and turns in his novel.  We are mere characters in this story.  This event could easily lead to another catalyst, that turns the country upside down.  Probably some weird thing with the November elections.  Years from now amateur historians could be theorizing, “what if another judge had signed the warrant” in the same way that they ask “what it the Archduke Ferdinand had survived” or “what if baby Hitler died in his crib.”

            JRW intentionally mis-spelling “cohenincidence”?
Is this supposed to be sarcasm or irony or drollery some higher form of linguistic legerdemain?
PS: For the record, “cohenincidence” means “NOT a coincidence”.
As in, “It is NOT a coincidence that Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyer signed the Mar-a-Lago warrant.”
NOT a coincidence.

            There may be coincidences, but that a particular judge signed a warrant is not necessarily a coincidence.  From what I hear from LEO’s, there are judges that are “friendly” or easy going wrt warrants and then there are those who are a pain in the ass wrt LEO’s and their warrant requests—like requiring further information, adding stipulations, and such.Of course, when listening to these descriptions from LEO’s, I hold my tongue, but can’t help thinking that these judges they “avoid” are precisely the one’s who in all likelihood have my (as a citizen with “rights”) best interests in mind.  Such is the system.

                What’s needed is an annual audit of Judges search warrants.“Probable cause” means greater than 50%. An audit to uncover what is actually discovered and what charges if any result should be published . The same, of course, should apply to every DA office applying for warrants.

            The FBI went judge shopping and settled for a Tribal pedophile enabler who bought a position as a magistrate. I think that is a perfect encapsulation of the current zeitgeist of the Banana Empire.

                But its Palm Beach, the Southeastern HQ for the Tribe since the 70’s.   You’re going to get a judge from the tribe.  It would be like looking for a podiatrist in Sherman Oaks.  Likely mostly tribal members.  And Trump lives in the heart of it.  Trump always wanted to be one of them.  Strangely the way they always wanted to be one of us before the 1950’s and never could.

                    There are tribal federal district judges there without Epstein ties, though. The FBI went straight to someone who they correctly thought was dirty enough to issue the warrant. Granted, we cannot rule out straight up idiocy and arrogance, either.

                        And this judge is a magistrate judge, not an Article 3 judge who is confirmed by the Senate and serves for life, etc. A magistrate judge’s role is to do a lot of the day-to-day work that a “real” federal judge is too high and mighty to deal with.This thing would look more legit if a  federal district judge had signed a warrant pertaining to a former president.

                Here’s the thing about Epstein, though: he was serving a foreign government that trailer trash worship and Regtime trash like FBI agents depend upon for side gigs. Why the fear? Both the Regime and the Tribe Worshippers would defend Epstein’s employer if raw footage emerged showing him and half of the Knesset raping and setting afire little goy girls.
The Junta apparently still has a misplaced fear of a violent uprising over little things like state-sponsored child rape.
Does anyone have any doubt who Epstein served, and how the Regime enabled him and his employer?

            “The FBI couldn’t find a worse person in Florida to have signed this warrant, conspiracy theory wise. In an additional twist the judge recused himself in the Trump vs. Clinton lawsuit as he thought it was too politically sensitive at his level.”

            Perhaps you are being arch, but your statement about God writing a cosmic best-seller full of bizarre plot twists is actually rather sobering and unsettling. What if, not only God exists, but he’s a borderline malicious prankster? Now I’m a Christian, and I do not believe this is the case, but it’s a less absurd explanation for our travails than many others I’ve heard.

        Today’s post is one for the ages. Hugely brilliant insight that gets to the root of why we languish in malaise rather than go grab up the pitchforks and rally in the street. The Deep State concept is amorphous and therefore impossible to attack directly, so Normie self-justifies remaining on the couch and rage-whining along with Tucker every night. It keeps the restless natives on their back foot because there is no one to go punch in the face. And soooooo, it is in the interest of the Deep State to perpetuate the Deep State Conspiracy Theory!!!!!But what if you evolve past the Deep State chimera (and it’s debilitating side-effect of keeping you inactive), and actually seek to identify the bad guys (pretty easy to do nowadays in this Brave New World in which privacy is extinct)? And it serves no purpose to have a long list because you’re not Zorro and you’re not going to win every battle. But you don’t have to. If even just one petty disease cell gets its just due, that sends a message. And if it happens enough times in enough disparate and unexpected ways, that message will begin to have an impact. And that impact may well trigger an exodus stampede. Just sayin’ for a friend.

            The Troubles.
American whites like to think in big battle terms. Glorious battles between uniformed armies. One side win, the other loses. The war is over.
That’s not what most civil wars are like. (Yes, our Civil War was like that, showing again what kind of war American whites like to fight.) Most civil wars are long, slow grinding affairs where the violence anything but glorious and often quite personal.

                The Arabs’ war against the French in Algeria may be what the upcoming American civil war will resemble.  Lots of local violence, violence between and within factions and extra-judicial trials and executions.  Never was a pretty picture?

                Not indiscriminate, not personal. That just spreads chaos and misery. Disease cells really exist. Yes, they vary in intensity and impact, but even the minor ones fester and lead to gangrene, so not trivial. Focus and precision are vitally important. And we live in a new high tech era. During WWI, artillery was dumb and therefore used as a blunderbuss. Today, a GPS guided shell can reliably hit a one meter MOA from 30 km. And don’t get me started on micro-drones. So not the Troubles.

                “That’s not what most civil wars are like. (Yes, our Civil War was like that … .”
We have never had a civil war. The term “civil war” has hard-and-fast definition.
So does “woman.”So does “vaccine.”So does (economic) “recession.”So does “gender.”So does “gay.”So does “drag.”
A war between two independent, sovereign nation-states is not a civil war.
A man in a sun dress is not a woman, no matter what that now-Justice Jumanji negress said.

                    People make mistakes when things are personal and emotional, and that weakness can be exploited by the Stasi. It’s the reason that so many good men fall victim to entrapment ops. Be the nobody on nobody”s radar. Unconventional. Spontaneous. And long gone having left no trace.Think outside the box. There are now a gazillion delivery drivers in the US. The Stasi can’t entrap or monitor all of them all the time. Ditto for maintenance workers, pool cleaners, maids, the list is endless. Hell, think of what a few sex workers in DC with COVID could do. Destroying societal trust comes at a heavy price.

        I forget exactly who it was, but someone once noted that strong popular ideology is often mistaken for conspiracy, because they both cause the same thing to happen: that is, large numbers of people working toward a single goal. Yes, it’s possible that they can all be doing that on command because some rich guy in a hollowed-out volcano arranged it. But it’s more likely that they’re all just wrapped up in a runaway ideology and are independently working for its benefit. Nobody had to tell them to do it, they just did it to feel righteous. That’s how ideology can be dangerous.As for not blaming the system, that’s the danger of a style of government being too associated with a nation. A German born in Leipzig in 1900 lived under monarchy, democracy, national socialism, communism, and democracy again during his lifetime, and there was never any question all along that he was still German. But what happens to a nation based on an idea when the idea starts visibly to fail? What happens to its people when they can no longer deny that it’s just not working anymore? Augustus found a novel way to overcome this problem: he didn’t call himself a king, even though that’s what he was and everybody knew it. It was just that nobody said so. The Senate had a little more or a little less actual power depending on how weak each succeeding emperor was, but everyone knew it had been effectively demoted from sovereign to advisory. The pretense kept the peace, though, so it held for centuries.I suspect that what we’re headed for is a breakup into a bunch of smaller units, all of which claim to be the “real America”, and all of which are ruled by someone who talks like Thomas Jefferson but governs like Huey Long.Well, if we’re lucky, that is.

Well said. But unlikely, IMHO.

We won’t be. If we ARE lucky, the water and electricity will not be permanently interrupted.  THAT would be lucky. But like a Jefferson/Huey Long hero, it is unlikely.

        The Deep State is not that complicated. Spend some time around public “servants” and listen to what they talk about. Pensions. Pensions. Pensions. What is your pension date? What is your pension multiplier? Does your sick leave get tacked on to your pension? Do you get retirement health insurance with your pension? If this guy gets elected I’m safe. If the other guy gets elected I’m not. etc.

            Pensions aside (they need to go for public sector), do well off boomers talk about their 401’s any less?  Not from what I hear on the radio wrt ad’s for advisory firms.  Seems those who do not talk about retirement are the majority of folk who simply have no ability to earn enough to plan for a future longer than the next paycheck—which of course I often lament upon as those people must vote for a “living”.

                California employers are now required to set up 401s (very similar to 401) for all employees – fake SSNs and all. The state assumes that service workers have zero agency and are destined to never develop any. And every “worker” (leftie parlance) should have identical “equity” – from dishwasher to rocket scientist.

                    Setting up pensions as in 401k’s won’t produce “equity” from low IQ individuals with time preference deficiencies—unless the rules change as well.When I was younger and managing an IT division for campus, an employee came to me and posed an idea.  He had about 5 years on the pension plan (mandatory) and he wanted to buy some land and put a trailer on it.  However, there was no option to “borrow” from the plan, so he was forced to quit.  He thereby would lose the State matching (50%), and need to pay taxes plus penalty for early withdrawal.  Hard to see where he’d achieve even a 30% return.What the employee wanted was for me to keep his position “open/unfilled” for 1 year so that he could return and re-enter the State retirement system without penalty—which was a complete payback of the amount taken.  I could/would not make such a promise, and he quit anyway.How does the State avoid this type of thinking?

        “Even though the basics of intelligent design contradict the fundamentals of Christianity, many Christians would rather believe God is endlessly tinkering with his creation than accept evolution.”My critique of evolution is that, ultimately, it presupposes life to be stupid and passive. We’re the result of random mutations, and what worked, worked. Randomness is in control.Seems to me life is intelligent and active. We living things adapt. That doesn’t discount survival of the fittest, rather, fitness is the ability to adapt and overcome, rather than hitting the mutation lottery.As for the Christian angle, biology is God’s technology, isn’t it?

            The key to understanding your observation is to remember that such takes *time*.  We are now reaching your concept of active evolution in our growth.  Whether or not we’ve been fast enough in this race is to be discovered.

                If you’ll excuse me, I have to tell a story.I went out with a girl in nursing school years ago. She told me they were teaching her that death is the last stage of life: “How do you know when a patient is dead?” —“Lack of vital signs.” —“So death is the absence of life, in other words?” —“Yes” —“So if death is the absence of life, how is it also the last stage of life?”Lol, obviously satanic shit they were teaching even then. Still, boots on the ground, medicine sees life as normal and death as abnormal, so to speak.Meanwhile, physics recognizes a natural tendency for ordered systems to become disordered, but it doesn’t recognize a natural tendency for disordered systems to become ordered, as far as I’m aware (it’s been a while). So physics sees ‘death’ as normal, and ‘life’ as abnormal.It kind of puzzles me that science is so schizo about life and death. It doesn’t seem too difficult to me to see reality as a contest between the two.

                        Thanks for this. Edgar Allen is my man, and has been for many years. I love to read his stories out loud to others, a pleasure that I have seldom had. But a couple of times, I did so for our little family gatherings, embracing me, my wife, my stepson, and my mother in law. I read several short stories, maybe The Masque of the Red Death, or A Cask of Amontillado, stories that fairly beg to be read aloud.But my love for Poe goes back to when I was a little guy of 6-7 years old. I had a bone disorder in my femur, fortunately self correcting but not for several years that necessitated me lying prone, no higher than elbow height front or back. I had a tutor from the school district 2-3 times a week, and this good lady had me start a scrap book wherein I wrote our poems, and illustrated them with crayon drawings. My favorite was Poe’s The Raven, for which I provided an illusrration of the Raven, perched upon a pallid bust of Pallas above the chamber door. Still have that scrapbook. Began to learn about darkness and loss at the knee of Edgar Allen Poe, even at that young age.

Randomness is in control.“Seems to me life is intelligent and active. We living things adapt. That doesn’t discount survival of the fittest, rather, fitness is the ability to adapt and overcome, rather than hitting the mutation lottery.”Your critique of evolution is not  very good, and by that I truly mean no disrespect. Truly. I don’t.Go here and read Chapter 6 “Darwinism”https://www.boervolkradio.co.za/boeke/Imperium.pdfYockey takes takes Darwinism apart in just a few pages (before moving on to “Marxism,” the next chapter in the book. Well worth wreading! ALL DR should know Yockey’s writing.Better yet, go here and buy the book. (It will take months to read it seriously. Very dense. But readable.)https://www.alibris.com/Imperium-The-Philosophy-of-History-and-Politics-Francis-Parker-Yockey/book/3150127?qcond=6&amp;qsort=p&amp;matches=11In any event, randomness is observably NOT in control. But let Yockey explain it.Also, and I really hesitated before adding this, but it’s the truth: Mathematicians published (in scholarly journals of mathematics) in 1965 that (Darwinian) evolution could not have happened the way it has been postulated. Mathematical proof. They didn’t way that evolution couldn’t have happened, mind you, but that it did not happen–could not have happened–in the way Darwinists postulate.I hesitate to add that, but I am not at home and cannot put my hands on the citations. And an admittedly cursory online searchin the last few minutes yielded nothing. The articles (there were two in 1965) are nowhere to be found online today (at least via a very quick, cursory search). And it would be pointless to cite the articles and journals at some later time when I am at home and have the citations at hand. Apologies. Take it or leave it.But read Yockey on Darwinism. Clear, quick, to-the-point, and enjoyable to read.

            Paintersforms:  I take issue with Zman’s assertion that believing human biology is the result of Intelligent Design (a creator) rather than random happenstance, equals a denial of microevolution.  Most Christians reject macro evolution –  the idea that one distinct species just happened, overtime, to morph into another one . . . not to mention the notable lack of any fossil record.  Many Christians do, however, accept that certain aspects of human biology and physiognomy will alter due to time and environmental pressures.God made the world and God designed man, but He does not constantly intervene to keep his creation in stasis.

                “God made the world and God designed man, but He does not constantly intervene to keep his creation in stasis.”Yes. And no. This is a question of human language, All words in all human languages refer *originally* and *properly* to things IN and OF THIS world. Therefore it is, as it always has been, impossible to use human language *literally* to talk about transcendent things.Therefore, we have developed a special “way of talking” about these things. We anthropomorphize. We allegorize and use simile and metaphor and poetry and all the rest of it–we HAVE to. The only tool we have to talk about these things is WHOLLY inadequate to the task–but it’s the only tool we have. I want to change the burnt-out light bulb, but the only tool I have is a hammer. Not suitable to the task but it’s all there is.“The Lord is a rock” and “the Lord is light” are obviously not both of them literally true. But it’s the special “way of talking” that allows us to say anything at all about these matters.All of that to zero in on your statement that “He does not constantly intervene to keep his creation in stasis.”If we postulate–and we do–that God is triune, then “He” doesn’t narrow down your statement enough. But the Second Person of the Holy and Undivided Trinity (an example of our “special way of talking about things that human language is inadequate for) *does* “intervene” (welll …) “constantly” (wellll …) to keep things “in stasis.” The Epistle to the Colossians spells that out for us (Colossians 1: 15–20). I cite here vs 17:“And He Himself [the Divine Logos] existed and is  [was and is] before all things, and in Him all things hold together.”  [He–the Divine Logos–is the cohesive force of the universe. Things are static because of the mystery of the Divine Logos, which “became flesh and dwelt among us … .”]So He doesn’t “intervene” b/c He is ever-present as the “force” (?) or the “glue” in which all things cohere ALL THE TIME, so that “constantly” is another example of the inadequacy of the only tool we have to talk about these things.So where does that leave us? Acknowledging the limitations of human intellect and categories of thought and language. Acknowledging that we have to use–deliberately and consciously–a special way of using human language. Relying on parables, poetry, symbols, music, ceremonies, rites, other arts, etc., grasping, groping towards something that we know, but which exists beyond the point at which human intellect and imagination utterly fail. (Einstein said that “Imagination is more important than knowledge.”)We can point, but we cannot describe–at least not literally.But man, from about the time of the so-called Renaissance, has come to regard himself–man–AND the WHOLE of Nature as a machine, not as an organism, and that explains modern “science” and “medicine” and everything else we see, not to mention the rubbish we hear.Until we return to grokking that man (And the universe) is an *organism* and not a machine, we shall continue to hear the jabbering classes talking their nonsense about “environment” and “equity” and “racism” and “sexism” and everything that arises from the materialism that came along with all its baggage that is driving DR folks to distraction (and that’s putting it mildly).Darwinism is the offspring of materialism and of capitalism and is a series of silly tautologies, even on the face of it, as Francis Parker Yockey explains in the references I made upthread.One of the odder manifestations of materialism is the notion that if we can *measure* something, we thereby gain control of that thing, as Wm Kunstler is fond of pointing out. Odd, but observable. It goes a long way towards explaining why Anthony Fauci is taken seriously. And why people can say–seriously–that they “believe” in “science.”There is, God knows, no end to human folly and self-delusion.But to get to something more practical: Do you know about this:https://tnm.me/news/political/bombshell-poll-66-of-texas-voters-want-texit/Kind regards, dear lady. Always like reading your thoughts.

                If God made a changing world, he equipped his creation(s) with the ability to adjust to such changes.  I’ve never thought otherwise, nor seen any contradiction between general Christian dogma and the theory of evolution.  Good point.

                It’s a matter of the mechanism, which I think goes to agency.For instance, environmental factors cause mutations that cause cancer, right? Or do the cells mutate in response to a hostile environment, even over time. If random mutations happen, would it be reasonable to expect random cancers? Yet cancers are consistent enough to be classified, complete with recommended treatments, etc.So there’s an example of one thing mutating into another due to environmental pressure (the only one I can think of off the top of my head), but it’s not random. I’ve heard it said it might even be a survival mechanism, who knows. A reversion to a primordial, unicellular state, a revolt against abuse.At any rate, I wouldn’t grow a third foot because I got too much sun. The random effect of environment is a much tougher than giving life agency, if you ask me, to say nothing of complete randomness. But again, it’s been a while.

                    Cellular mutation can be natural as well as environmentally induced.  The body is not a perfect engine, hence even babies can get cancer without necessarily a harmful environment as being the obvious cause.  Most of the time, genetic accidents upon cell reproduction are weeded out through our immune system, but that weakens with age, hence cancer rates go up as we get older.

            I have no religious problem with neodarwinism. God could have set up the biological world that way, and it seems a pretty elegant design to me. Being a Catholic, even the Vatican has endorsed evolution.
I have a scientific problem with neodarwinism It is not supported by the data. This has been known for longtime and the theory is a zombie, a walking dead. This is hidden for ideological reasons.

            You have most things right, but I would clarify a few points where I believe you err.Evolution and inescapably, life itself, are a type of “algorithm.” (This is Dennett’s terminology in his “Darwin’s Dangerous Idea”). Life can be viewed as simply a “machine” whose sole function is to create  copies of itself.You are correct that randomness is a crucial part of the process. Random mutations occur. I would dispute the “in control,” part, however. The deciding factor is, as you note, the fitness (survival of the fittest, natural section, basically the same process). The children most fit tend to survive, the less fit die off. The school of hard knocks, as it were 🙂You may not like to accept that life is “stupid and passive,” but if Dennett is right, is it precisely that. He calls evolution a mindless algorithm. In the of life form X, if it lives to reproduce, it will make one or a thousand X’ descendants. Each will be a near-perfect copy of X. It is, in fact, the very existence of the imperfections that lead to better (and worse!) copies.The proof of concept comes at the hands of the environment the new X’ must live in. This is is the natural selection part. The new organism is put to the test by its milieu.Life most definitely is active and adaptive. But intelligence? No way, it is a very late arrival on the scene. You will be hard pressed, I suspect, to impute intelligence to a blue-green algae, which some scientists think is similar to the first life forms that arose about 3.5 billion years past.None of the above is to even touch the problem of the origin of life.

                It’s a matter of shallow metaphysics for me, when you get down to it. I find it galling and unsatisfying. How anyone can reduce Creation to a ‘mindless algorithm’ is beyond me.
As for the blue-green algae, it has a metabolism. All we can do is crack hydrocarbons and burn them, yet we’re smarter, right 🙂

                I think that life that is asexual in its mode of reproduction may approach the status of being an algorithm.But once sexual reproduction enters the lists, it is a whole new ball game. No longer is the pattern to flawlesslyreplicate the living being, but rather to embrace the production of beings that are, by their naturenot merely flawless replicas of one gene set, but combinatory in their genetic makeup. This accelerates evolution to a radically new set of possibilities. Man and woman he made them. Of course, when spiritual error deranges the potential of assortive mating among humans, spiteful mutants can – and do – result.

        “Blaming the system for American decline is too much for most people. They were raised to worship the idea of America. Blaming the system for why things are getting progressively worse is like burning the flag. It is a lot easier to blame some corrupting forces that are manipulating events. The same phenomenon set in with the Soviet Union after Stalin. Blaming bad actors operating in the shadows of the party was safer than questioning the system.”The systems underpinning the modern indebted, sprawling, unwieldy American Empire are pretty fragile. Lots of smart folks, from NN Taleb to Zman, have spilled lots of ink on this topic. It’s a lot easier to focus on personalities than it is to assess really complex systems. So people take the path of least resistance.Zman has recently addressed the apparent incompetence of the Administrative State. I offered the observation that the State was now too complex for anyone to manage it competently. Lots of people here on the Zman site down-voted my take on this. That’s okay, but I would suggest it’s worth pondering a little more. I think a key plank in the DR’s platform should be much smaller, simpler, less ambitious State.

            “I offered the observation that the State was now too complex for anyone to manage it competently. Lots of people here on the Zman site down-voted my take on this.”Same here, some months ago. Don’t know why so many intelligent people (the readers of this site) can’t see that hugeness and complexity *necessarily* remove responsiveness and responsibility from the gov’t and all its minions and all its servants and worshipers and supporters. Gov’t of a VAST country through means of a state apparatus whose complexity is more Byzantine than Byzantium ever was *necessarily* regards itself and its functioning FAR above the American’s putative explanation for the purpose of government.But even the smartest people very often can’t see that. Perhaps for the reason Zman has pointed out today: They were taught to worship the American state. They are imbued with a mythos–a faith–a narrative, which is why Poe’s Sonnet upthread is a better way of communicating transcendent truth than some “factual” essay or speech. One poster upthread told us a story about dating a nursing student and death and life. Always the best way to get at the truth–truth NOT being identical with what we call “facts.” Two different things.Christ taught that way–telling stories.

        Trump continues to inadvertently do the job that he does best, namely lure our rulers and their minions out into the open.
Their inability to leave Trump alone reflects their inability to leave Joe Normie alone. Trump Derangement Syndrome is really Joe Normie Derangement Syndrome.

He certainly WAS, no question about it. Throwing his supporters under the bus in the statement he made about the “insurrection” right after that happened was proof of what you say.
But unless I miss my guess, Trump has been forced to undergo what I’ll call a Great Awakening. I rather doubt that he is still King of Normies. If his eyes are not open now, well …

                        Yes, he could be a character from a Shakespeare’s play. He is the son of a self-made man and he is not accepted in the American “aristocracy” (meaning the oligarchy that is at the top). He is considered a buffoon, a new rich, somebody without manners by this “aristocracy”.He craves this approval by the aristocracy with an intensity that borders the irrationality.I remember watching a documentary about him. He had a hotel or a mansion (was it MAL?) and he put the music at the highest volume only to disturb the “beautiful people” at the other side of the bay. Like a woman scorned.Trump is not Caesar, which came from a noble family coming from the Venus goddess. Caesar had an amazing self-esteem and no self-doubt. Trump is Caius Marius, who came from a small town (Arpinus) and craved being accepted into the Roman aristocracy.But Caius Marius fought and won and was the ruler of Rome more times that anyone else before, opposing the Roman aristocracy (the “boni” or “optimates”). Trump won once and then, he wanted to make a deal with the American aristocracy and be accepted by them. We know how well this has turned out.

                Trump as the “king” of normies is a pretty good insight, and that Trump was handed his head by TPTB  should be an eye opener for Joe Normie who still believes in the system.  In that Trump has done us a great service.
Trump played by the rules as he understood them, sound familiar?  It does to me.  There go I but for the Grace of God…  Can anyone here say they were smarter in their youth?  I certainly can’t.

        “Most of the people who hated Trump could not tell you why they hated him so much. The deep state concept filled that hole.”The Trump haters, the liberals and the Dems, have never, as far as I know, been enamored of the concept of the deep state. If indeed they are aware of it beyond the level of meme. The concept is mostly the provenance of alt right people like myself.“The deep state is why popular government is a terrible idea. In popular government, in theory at least, policy reflects the popular will. Therefore, bad results must be the fault of the people. How can this be possible when most people never wanted the bad result? It must be something else. Whether communism, socialism or liberal democracy, the people can never blame themselves, so they will find someone to blame, even if they have to invent him.”But what if popular government is a farce and charade and serves as threadbare camouflage for oligarchical rule, in conjunction with bureaucratic forces that have a vested interest in empire (even one in precipitous decline)? There was something similar in the Soviet Union, fronted by old men like Brezhnev, Chernenko, Gromyko, and so on, behind of whom were the army, the party apparatus, and the KGB. Why do you consider it so far-fetched that the ossified US system of governance resembles it?Americans can vote but even the dimmer ones can perceive that it doesn’t make any difference to the quality of their lives as to which front man, which marionette, succeeds to office. Life just steadily grows worse. You didn’t have to be a conspiracy like myself to sense this. And I think the US ruling class realizes that the proles are wising up. Perhaps this explains the hysteria with which they’re going after Trump and his supporters. The FBI has become the Tonton Macoute.

            The Trump haters, the liberals and the Dems, have never, as far as I know, been enamored of the concept of the deep state.
They use different names, but it is the same concept. Mysterious forces operating in the shadows. They have a whole industry modeled on the X-Files to find the invisible Hitler army.

                “Mysterious forces operating in the shadows.”
There’s nothing mysterious whatsoever about the fact that Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyer signed the Mar-a-Lago warrant.
We all know precisely what that means.
Why are we beating around the bush here?
What’s the purpose of pretending that we don’t notice the 800lb gorilla sitting over in the corner of the room?
Is it simply cowardice?

                    “Mysterious forces operating in the shadows.”“There’s nothing mysterious whatsoever about the fact that Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyer signed the Mar-a-Lago warrant.”I am not convinced that the left believes–or ever has believed–in a “vast right-wing conspiracy.” Certainly the big-wig leftists don’t. As for the rank-and-file nincompoops, they “believe the science” and “follow the science” and nothing more need be said about that and them. Useful idiots. The rank-and-file faithful. The cat women. The tatted gal with nose ring and blue hair on the bus. Male feminists. Or let me say rather “male” “feminists.” And so on.I think the Hillary Cees and Nancy Pees know what utter BS it all is, but their useful idiots are true believers. It’s a show. A traveling patent-medicine show in a Wild West cowboy town in the 1870s. They even sell the elixir, but it’s now called “The Science.”It’s as though Lydia Pinkham had come back in the form of Hillary C or Nancy Pee.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fZLWcyj1kw

                        Infant:  Well said.  Too many mistake your average antifa member for those who internationally siphon money to them.  Too many here think the average DC bureaucrat – even the mid-level managers they may know – are aware of the string pullers.My husband and I had some pretty serious clearances back in the day, and today he realizes just how little he knew about who he worked for.  He still has occasional knee-jerk lapses of “they’re too stupid to be coordinating all this” and then I read him a few headlines and he reminds himself stupid and crafty are not mutually exclusive, and he was never high enough on the totem pole to really understand who was in control.

                There’s more than a terminological difference there.
Current_left conspiracy theories aren’t about the deep state or oligarchy or the MIC or whatever. They’re *complaints* that the already disempowered right has evaded perfect control, that the mop-up job is incomplete. Ever-more-censored memers are still dogwhistling, pols are flashing “OK” to the insurrection, Trump buried incriminating documents with his wife, etc.
Their paranoid worry is that they *don’t* have absolute power. Ours is that they might.

            “But what if popular government is a farce and charade and serves as threadbare camouflage for oligarchical rule, in conjunction with bureaucratic forces that have a vested interest in empire (even one in precipitous decline)?”This. Leviathan is or at least was the Deep State and serves United States oligarchs by destroying their enemies, keeping the populace satisfied, and most importantly empowering their interests and allies. “Deep State” has a whiff of paranoia and I understand why it is resisted, but it is good shorthand for current reality. I also agree that, for all its faults, there is nothing that approximates democracy within the borders of the United States and has not been since Appomattox. People will tolerate an oligarchic police state as long as they have some prosperity and independent agency, both of which are receding and almost gone.The post-Civil War arrangements only worked because the oligarchical dictatorship threw crumbs to the White majority and did not openly seek war on them. That’s gone forever, and the die was cast 8/8. None of us knows what the resolution will be, but hopefully a peaceful dissolution will become possible once the dying empire is actually dead.

What’s kept the union together has been some kind of prosperity, some crumbs thrown to the white working class and white lower middle class. As this is becoming more and more of a mirage, the bonds keeping the country together are dissolving. When this happens the velvet glove disappears, leaving just the iron hand overtly in control. And we are seeing this. Were I an oligarch or deep state apparatchik, I would be very worried indeed. I would be buying land abroad and looking at getting a second passport. And I believe some of them are.Looking at it dispassionately, the USA can’t go back to what it was internationally and nationally in 1955. All good things come to an end. MAGA was and is a pipe dream if it meant recreating Eisenhower’s USA. New powers have arisen, with economic and geopolitical competition heating up, and resource wars have intensified. The USA has been at the losing end and indeed, there is nowhere for a hegemon to go except downwards. The international standing of the USA as the world’s premier industrial and military power is what allowed its ruling elite to buy the tacit consent of its people to the ruling class structure. That’s gone. Irretrievably.

        The concept of a “deep state” is useful shorthand for the kind of bureaucratic Brownian motion we all know and love from the office. It’s like watching sediment settle in a glass of water, or a campfire burn — it seems like there *must* be a pattern there, just at the edges of our consciousness… but there isn’t.To assign conscious agency to a “Deep State,” though, is to forego what we know about people. People plot, yeah, but about the only thing worse than a failed plot is a successful one, and both for the same reason — since everyone was only in the plot for his own temporary personal advantage, the Prisoner’s Dilemma takes over. Now he feels he has to shank the other guys before they shank him first.The Deep State (capital letters) assumes that the morons in Washington are disciplined enough to not only take one for the team in order to execute Plot A, but to keep on taking one for the team while carrying out Plots B, C, and D — none of which they get credit for. It also assumes none of them will ever find it to his advantage to spill his guts about capers E, F, and G that he knows about because he hangs around with the other Deep Staters all day.That’s the huge crisis this Mar-a-Lago thing has forced. Only “mutually assured destruction” keeps these kinds of sociopaths in line… and now that is off the table. Guys like Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott have to know they’re next. Anyone who has ever gotten a cross-eyed look from anyone in the Regime is feeling the crosshairs on his neck. Better dump all your kompromat now!

Every FBI field agent and every dirty local federal magistrate is a potential hostage for these guys. I’m pretty certain Abbott lacks the balls as do all Republicans at the federal level, but DeSantis might not be hesitant to throw one of these jackboots into a local jail where the sharpened shank awaits. It would do wonders the next time some pig decides to go full Gestapo.

                If I’m DeSantis, I am launching my own huge, very public investigation into all this pronto. He has to know he’s Orange Man 2.0, so if he doesn’t want to spend the remainder of his (surely very short) life getting “investigated” (or “audited” by some of the 87000 new IRS agents), he’d best nuke those guys from orbit. Surely he’s smart enough to figure that out….?If he isn’t, I recommend that everybody in any kind of position put Robert Conquest’sThe Great Terroron their reading list pronto.

                    I know you are a historian, so please indulge me, but just as a preface there were two Great Terrors, the first also known as the Red Terror under Lenin. It consolidated Bolshevik rule after a purported assassination attempt on Big Red.The United States today is in some ways analogous to the original Red Terror. Sure, the Regime wants the veneer of democracy to keep the Empire’s satrapies in line, but it also has shown a willingness to use more brutal and violent means to consolidate its rule. The United States today is in the process of a consolidation similar to Lenin’s program. It is not too late to stop it but the window is closing.DeSantis has in his hands the ability to do what Solzhenitsyn wrote should have been done to individual Cheka agents. If he does not take that opportunity, he is, as you wrote, next.And, yes, Conquest was the shit.

                Jack Dobson:  Can’t speak to DeSantis, but fully concur Abbott lacks the balls.  I’m honestly surprised he’s continued to send the few handfuls of Mestizos north, despite the pushback.  He must be feeling some pressure from someone – but I guarantee it’s not the voters; the red Texas repukes soundly rejected the only primary candidate who had the guts to even mention immivaders (a local auto magnate).

                The President can at any time seize the National Guard, but every state has a State Guard that ONLY the governor of that state commands.
The governors know that, as do the members of the various State Guards, but very few Americans know about that power. The governors are not powerless, even now.

            I think that’s what has to be worrying, the signs point to even the highest level of the Justice Department not knowing about this, but still going along with it (whatever sheds of credibility the system has, not being worth saving in the hunt for dissidents).  This means that any Stasi who has the favor of the regime, and who has it in for DeSantis has the regime’s backing in whatever endeavor he may want to engage in.  DeSantis would never be able to plead to a higher authority because, apparently, there isn’t one.

        Didn’t Caesar, Pompei and Krakus conspire to bribe, threaten and eventually kill patricians and Senators to get their legislation passed?Didn’t Octavion, Antony and Lepidus conspire to kill off a large number of patricians and Senators to remove their enemies and pocket their wealth?Didn’t Cromwell and his Protestant ministers conspire to sack and loot the abbeys and take the Catholic Church’s wealth and lands for themselves?I could go on and on here.America’s Progressivist State is a corrupt and failed system managed by corrupt and failed minsters. It is predicated on large amounts of debt funding economic growth. The ability to create real growth has faded because of a multitude of decades that lack technological breakthroughs that create massive increases in productivity. Moving the manufacturing to China lowered wages, but no new, step change, technological innovation capable of raising living standards took place. It was a wealth transfer. The fruits of that enterprise are now known. At the same time, America was to think while “they”, were to sweat. The vast number of the thinking tasks were and are unproductive. In fact, many of them are counterproductive across economic and social dimensions.The system that is dependent on taking from the productive is too big. The schemes and scams employed to create large gains in nominal wealth while real wealth declined for society as a whole are failing. The leverage they employ are a ticking time bomb. The unproductive sit upon that powder keg. Many don’t even understand it. Some do. None are willing and capable of the honesty required to begin to address it. The people who are ruled over are also not willing to address it. A massive decline in living standards, even with a cogent plan to recover after the necessary sacrifices is not something anyone will embrace. Perhaps the masses won’t embrace because: some don’t have the intelligence to have those time preferences; those that do don’t trust the leaders who are not leading but acting with avarice and greed while being dishonest. We see them selling out to get theirs.Next time you are at a cloud person’s dinner party and someone brings up climate change, imagine them giving up what they have to solve, “the problem.” Try and say it in a nice way and watch their brows wrinkle as they go silent in the first moment of self reflection they have ever allowed to permeate the space reserved solely for pursuing personal gain in the form of status and money.The system invents problems that are really grifts to try and manage the decline in stealth – catastrophic climate change being a big one. While not informed in detail, the majority of the public knows in their bones there is something wrong with that story. That project must be forced onto society. Does Pete Bootygig know that mass EEV adoption is a suicide mission? No. He is a dolt and a true believer who has surrounded himself with the same. Just give him cash, a title that sounds important and prestige from the monumental achievement of sodomy and he is just fine. Do Elon Musk and Larry Fink know it is an unfeasible engineering project from a financial and materials perspective? Of course. But, both have a lot to gain by pushing the grift. There is a word for what I just described. Corruption.The system is unfeasible. The bigger problem is that the informed actors are deeply corrupt. It is a pathological corruption. The people too are corrupt. They would rather clutch their beliefs and moralizing like a child does its teddy bear through its first ever night in a thunderstorm.The deep state is real. It is thousands of little Triumvirates perpetually playing out – violent in foreign affairs and non-violent and pathologically deceitful in domestic affairs. The worsening state of the system means that the domestic plots and schemes will turn more violent toward the immediate and known enemies. It will stop only when it is stopped or when its persecutions become too exhausting. There is nothing new under the sun. Sometimes its name is Cromwell. Sometimes a Triumvirate with a version number. In the age of mass bureaucracy and gigantic corporations that use it for revenue and legal advantage, it is called The Deep State.

            In addition to the bureaucracy and corporations I neglected to mention the political patronage groups and grifts:– public and private employee unions– race based power political factions– ideological interest groups used by legally protected foundations (think Sierra Club; Greenpeace)– Churches (immigration; anti-racism funds and grants)– Illegal immigration and a massive grab bag of subsidies for churches; lawyers; real estate developers; hoteliers; political machines …– hordes of feral lawyers involved in creating, perpetuating and expanding every single one of the grifts and projects in the Deep State.– Universities and Colleges: student loan subsidies for banks; ideological conscription into Religio Progressivo; new hordes of unproductive credential-ists requiring new grifts and projects to keep them employed; corporate IP development and job training subsidies …Most of these are not grand conspiracies. But they are projects in perpetual motion and kept in motion because the civilization has lost its ability to innovate and create greater levels of real prosperity. So it keeps these going as long and as far as it can – just because … jobs! Worse, the civilization has lost its ability to be content with the way things are for a long time to come – equilibrium and stability. Why? Because those who have lent out too much money refuse to take their losses. Enter the conspirators at the top of the system.

                Cromwell did not loot the Catholic church,that would be the French with their innumerable raids into Italy ,especially after their alliance with the Ottoman empire.The Catholic church in England ,in terms of property, became the Anglican church.Wouldn’t have happened if the Catholic church hadn’t  blocked Henry’s divorce in the hope that it would force England back into a civil war like the War of the Roses. But the “Catholic church” was a plaything of French and Spanish foreign policy so this anti-Catholic behaviour by the Church led to northern European  disaffection.You need to read some history books before pontificating on England or Protestantism!

                    When I travelled all over England at several sites there was a blurb where Henry VIII raided the abbey, arrested bishops and priests … It is well documented that Cromwell and his conspirators looted the churches in England.My post was not a pontification about England and Protestantism. Its point was that there are conspiracies organized and carried out by people at the center of power. I said nothing of the motivations of Cromwell and the intrigues of the Catholic Church, which I know little of. I do appreciate your comment. It underscores my point about conspiracies. It sounds like in addition to Cromwell’s scheming, but that Spanish and French crowns and the Catholic Church had schemes of their own in motion.So, please, feel free to educate us all in greater details about those plots and schemes for greater power and control.

                        Remember, there were two different Cromwells, separated by a good interval of years, and rising to power under diffferent circumstances at different times. There was the one who served Henry VIII, and then later the one who was a Roundhead tyrant.

All government agencies (FBI, Military, NSA, IRS, etc.) have correctly gauged that there are ZERO consequences for overreach, and a massive potential upside if they stumble into pay dirt.  Why not roll the dice?

            “In 2 weeks no one will remember this; on to the next out rage.”I respectfully disagree. There ain’t no comin’ back from this. This is a message–the same message sent by the Bolsheviks by slaughtering the Russian Imperial Family (and their dog): “There is no going back. You peons have nobody around whom to rally and coalesce. You are defeated. Surrender NOW!”They may or may not kill Trump, but the MEAN to put him in prison. The “classified-documents-in-the-toilet-caper is their backup plan in the event that the January “insurrection” caper doesn’t work out as intended. They have a Plan B. They have NO intention of losing another election, and they don’t have to. And they know it.They MEAN to have Trump in prison.

        As a Christian I have no problem accepting the concept of evolution and a orderly universe with very little intervention from God. It just means those TV preachers much like the leftist cults of Gaia and equality are much easier to discern as phony false prophets because they  claim to control the uncontrollable.If we think about it even in the Christian faith God is shown to rarely intervene directly in man’s affairs over great lengths of time.Most of what is happening in the political arena is probably just like this essay implies. Lots of random decisions leading to disfunction that are not for the most part coordinated except in rare cases.Our political system has developed into operating like the USPS.

            I would assume they flipped a housekeeper who has been there for years.  Probably threatened to deport her family.  The only kind of deportation the Biden Administration supports.
Although it could be about anybody.  Trump surrounds himself with lowlifes.  It wouldn’t be that hard for the FBI to leverage one of them.

                I would assume there is no mole. The police lie on warrant applications all the time. It is so common that a FBI lawyer casually doctored e-mails used in a warrant application. Kevin Clinesmith produced fraudulent documents to the FISA court, which is supposed to be the highest bar for professional integrity. if they are willing to lie to the FISA court, they will lie to anyone.My guess is they interviewed many people around Trump’s villa as a cover story, then claimed they had a confidential source. Then they quickly leaked that to the media as part oft he operation. The point of this was to embarrass trump, harm his political plans and maybe find something they can leak to the media at a later date. Six month from now the media will have a story about finding bizarre sex toys in Trumps closet.The whole thing was a media play as the se people live in a media world.

                    Sounds like a well thought out and coordinated plot orchestrated by a significant number of people inside of a government agency and coordinated over a month long time horizon with the media all timed to coincide with the needs of politically expedient time frames to benefit the establishment political parties.

Absolutely true. But as some have already pointed out, Trump had a pretty slick video all ready to release as soon as the crime was perpetrated. He must have known it was coming.

                    Intriguing and quite plausible, Z. This presupposes faith in the propaganda organs and The Regime, and they still think people believe and respect them, which indicates just how detached from reality they are. Producing the bizarre sex toys–and I don’t at all discount that will happen–will be one more nail in their coffin, though.Something went horribly awry, obviously. We should celebrate this self-own. I do look forward to watching McConnell and Co. explaining how, askshually, nothing can be done about it. And, in a sense, that’s true but for all the wrong reasons. The Soviet Empire, and the British Empire, imploded gracefully. This one has shaped up to be an absolute shitshow.

                Agree with Z-man, there is probably no mole.
When you’re investigating an organized crime cartel, it’s standard procedure to brag about how much intel you’re getting from your CIs.  This leads to a ton of internal chaos and bloodshed as the mobsters turn paranoid and bump each other off.  Thus doing your job for you.

        Today’s claim leaked to the media, is that the only purpose of the raid was to retrieve classified documents illegally removed from the White House and that they wanted it to “apolitical” and “low key.”  Could they possibly be this stupid?  If this was the case, it would also be in their interest to release the warrant in an attempt to put to rest the claims it was politically motivated and they aren’t doing that.  The FBI seems to be daring the Republicans to do something punitive towards them.  They did nothing meaningful to the IRS after Lois Lerner, so that is a good bet.

        None of this is to suggest that there are no conspiracies. A central feature of human nature is cooperation, which is another way of saying that it is the nature of man to plot with other men.A point often made in these commentaries, correctly, is that there is no central feature of human nature. In fact, contrary to the ideas of Edward O. Wilson and others, there is no human nature. In western society, at least, what little cooperation that exists is buried under mountains of competition, which is essential to capitalism. If the drone in the next cubicle can get credit for the lucrative contract you engineered, he will. Corporations aren’t interested in developing the best possible toothpaste, toilet paper or spaghetti sauce, they want to sell more than the other guys.What may appear to be cooperation is actually an effort to improve the status of an individual among others. Even in a conspiratorial environment, that individual is more interested in his own situation than that of all the plotters, as he must be.

        Yre but now you have to say, “What’s the system” if not a large menagerie of players acting in now concert now in opposition. In any system, some have more authority than others. The unforeseen always makes its appearance sometimes in the form of black swans whom the opportunists hope, in line with their schemes, won’t go to waste. Like a drugged dragon slouching its portly carcass along the track, consensus, however temporary, does emerge for a time.If Trump &amp; family are wise they’ll flee the country with whatever wealth they can stash away before they get the Trotsky treatment though perhaps less fatal. I’ll back the conspiracy that our ruling elite is making its deal with the Chinese ruling elite to preserve America’s natural resources for pan-Asian exploitation in return for our ruling class serving as the pan-Asians’ resident managers. But then I believed the Russians threw that 1980 Olympic hockey game against a bunch of American schoolboys. Just a coincidence that they went on to roundly defeat team Canada composed of the times’ leading NHL stars.

                It’s the same model for all of them:  Inside stock information, phony book sales/bribes, drawing a big salary while all expenses are covered by taxpayers, corporate no-show jobs/bribes for family members, outlandish speaking fees for teleprompter pablum, “charitable” foundations that cover personal expenses and employ their entourages, and whatever campaign contributions they can funnel to their personal accounts.

                    DLS:  Not to detract from an excellent comment, but in Pelosi’s case she had a head start.  Her father was mayor of Baltimore, back before Baltimore was Lagos.  There’s no way her daddy achieved that office without plenty of ‘connections,’ and she was his princess.  My husband’s Italian great-grandfather was a shoemaker; I guarantee that Nancy’s ancestor had a very different career.

            When leftists and democrats do it it’s communication of ideas.  When normies or any other of their despised deplorables do it it’s conspiracy.   Just my rule of thumb.

        My time in the Army was my first exposure to hardcore conspiracy culture. Black soldiers were sure the government created AIDs to kill them and them alone, even though their predilection for fat fatherless white women ensured the disease would eventually spread to the white devils, too. I had a buddy who was big into the David Icke, Annunaki theory, that we’re ruled by interdimensional lizards who subsist on human flesh. Sounds strange until you look at Adam Schiff’s bulging eyes or Chuck Schumer’s tongue darting out of his mouth every time he licks his lips.My personal feeling is that power works like Venn Diagrams, and when you get overlap, you get action. People in entertainment, NGOs, politics, business, law, want something, feel a certain way, drift together, play squash together, chat when attending their kids’ graduations, and then, like a kind of planetary alignment, things get set in motion. Some things, however, can be traced back to a single actor, or two actors, like Russiagate.“Con” = with “Spire”= breathe. It just takes two to whisper.

        It’s almost is if Aquinas’ idea that monarchy is the best form of government was right. I know we threw all that mambo jumbo overboard when we became Enlightened, of course, but maybe we should reconsider – if only in this one, tiny, area. Everything else the Enlightenment said was still good, of course.

            I read articles from Amerika.org every now and again and he proposes the same thing, only he gets to be the monarch. Bring up the fact that we have an aristocracy now, only they go by other names and the author gets rather indignant.I am a direct descendant of William Marshall – a man who served five English kings. Yes, some of his decisions were made with his personal interests in mind, however, for the most part he acted for “The good of the realm”. He was so well respected, that even people who disagreed with him at times sought out his counsel. I don’t believe I can name anyone today who would fit that bill, so we would have to generate a completely new landed aristocracy.Given the state of “education” in this country, this going to take a while.

                Hans Herman Hoppe theorizes of an monarch as vs a democracy.  Not sure we even have an aristocracy as we would conceive of it from ancient times.  A monarch in theory “owns” the country he rules and has a vested interest in its people’s growth and prosperity.  Similarly, the aristocracy the monarch presides over has vested interest in keeping their principalities prosperous as well and remaining in good stead of the King.We obviously don’t have a king, despite what we like to rail about, but we do have a grouping of powerful individuals whom we refer to often as our “aristocracy”.  But really, we need to call them what they are—rootless/ruthless global cosmopolitans looting a once prosperous nation to the detriment of its people (you and me and everyone else not of their ilk).A new aristocracy must be one that recognizes its duty to the people of the nation as being in its highest interest, or at least a change to a monarchical system which can control the aristocracy’s basic destructive instincts.In summary, “You don’t s**t where you eat!”

                    The taxonomy works like this:
Three kinds of deciders: one, few, many. Two kinds of decisions: for the common good and for the personal good.
Good rule by one: monarchy. Bad rule by one: tyranny
Good rule by few: aristocracy. Bad rule by many: oligarchy
Good rule by many: republic. Bad rule by many: democracy

                        This is Aristotle’s classification but, with permission of the Great Philosopher, it is wrong. Nobody can always be right.Democracy is rule by a hidden oligarchy. The oligarchy that can manipulate the masses to vote what the oligarchy wants.Golden age of democracy. Athens. Most important person: Pericles. Who was Pericles? A poor, a man from the middle class? He was a man from an aristocrat family.How many families ruled ancient Rome during the Republic? Only a handful of aristocratic families.Back to the future, that is, to the present. Do you think this woman with a blue hair has had an original idea in all her life? He only says and votes what she has been told.You can’t cheat genetics. Gregory Clark proves in “The Son also Rises” that the same families rule for centuries, even after a democratic or communist revolution.So there is autocracy (monarchy, dictatorship) and two classes of oligarchy (aristocracy and hidden oligarchy, that is, democracy).

            I’ve come to realize that any form of government is doomed for any longevity.  The Pareto principal will always be in effect.  Man is inately competitive, someone will always want to accrue more resources than they need.  The survival instinct evolutionarily always there.  Right now a certain (((group))) has it in spades!

                I disagree somewhat.  While the nature of man will always lead to corruption in power, I do believe that a system supported by a homogenous society could work.  The older I get and the more books I read, the more and more I am convinced that we were never meant to intermingle.  Relationships with other races will NEVER work as the minority race will always be able to use the minority status as a tool to create guilt over inequities.  Think about how many of our problems are simply caused by having minority populations.  So many of the invented problems due to minority status would simply go away if you removed the other races.  Get rid of blacks and you nearly eradicate violent crime.To me, no system, no matter it’s merits can succeed in a heterogeneous, multi-racial society.  It is impossible.

                        First the Dutch, then the English, then the Germans, then the Irish and Italians, then the Puerto Ricans, then the Russians, and always at the bottom, the Negroes. I look at it as a large city police department, where there are people of every stripe working somewhat in tandem for the greater good, but at night they go back to homes in neighborhoods of their own kind.

                        P, I’m all for a respite among my own kind after working hours, but I disagree with all races mixing and working together during work.  I don’t see that happening now, nor do I see a general tendency for each race to be mutually/equally productive.  What we have now is a forced splitting of the “spoils” (employment opportunities) via AA and quotas.  This is a burden and limitation on productivity.

                ” … someone will always want to accrue more resources than they need. ”That, of course, is the *only* way a population larger than that of a tribe can psosper. IT is *right* and *just* and altogether *fitting* and *proper* that people should strive to “accrue more resources than they need.” Without that, how could there be investment? WIthout investment (and lending), there is no material progress for a group larger than a tribe.IF you want to live in such primitive and backward circs, knock yourself out, but I’ll stick with human achievement, thrift, saving &amp; investing and the things that ONLY those things can provide.

            Imagine if after Yorktown, the South had invaded New England and burned Boston to the ground and sold the inhabitants into slavery. There never would have been a Civil War and we would not have had the lunacy of the 20th century. Of course, if the Indians had done their job and slaughtered the Pilgrims, we would probably have been spared much of the 20th century.The point is, how you run things is not as important as who runs things. If the Founders had been properly skeptical of Yankee New England and baked into the new system preventative measures, maybe the system could have worked. Short of a great culling of the herd, the only system that could work in modern America is a loose federation of regions. You would have to round up the mutants first, maybe ship them off to Africa, but after that a system somewhere between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitutions would work.In the end, the place to start is with the eradication of Roundheadism.

        i think a common occurrence in a situation like ours – where the dominant system clearly is failing – is that individual events are ascribed too much significance.   think of a building on fire where some piece of the structure falls away; what does that mean?  just that the building is on fire; if that piece hadn’t fallen, another would.  so things like the mar-a-lago raid happen, but in and of themselves are only a sign of the overall collapse.  there is no deeper meaning to such individual events.instacuck is always going on about how the biden people are intentionally wrecking things.   they might very well be, but even if they weren’t the system would still be collapsing.   it started failing long before biden was put in power.   he might be hastening the end point, but he isn’t the root cause.  and in the end, the political class will be destroyed.

                Isn’t the root cause our system of government? The Constitution is what got us here or, if you insist, the thing that was unable to prevent us from getting here. In either case, here we are.
We can pull the logic string a little more and ask what it was that landed us on the Constitution, but I think we need to start with the idea that the Founders just got it wrong, is all.

                    “Isn’t the root cause our system of government?” .No. The root cause is human nature. History repeats itself b/c human nature does not change. The value of studying history seriously and over the long term is precisely that such study reveals to the student those things that are constant in human nature.“We can pull the logic string a little more and ask what it was that landed us on the Constitution, but I think we need to start with the idea that the Founders just got it wrong, is all.”Well, you are not wrong, for all that you’ve accrued a lot of downvotes. When Patrick Henry was asked why he was not going to participate in the Constitutional Convention, he said, “Because I smell a rat.” And indeed he did. The Articles of Confederation were FINE. They were undermined by statists, who managed to organize the destruction of the loose (and functional–despite the stupid propaganda to the contrary) confederation under the aptly named Articles of Confederation. They were scrapped in favor of a unitary central state with both political and NONETARY control, by means of which the once-sovereign states were reduced to the status of mere provinces of a unitary and centralized state, which was the “rat” that Patrick Henry smelled.The reason it has taken two hundred-plus years for the country to collapse is simply that we had such a fabulously rich continent under the stewardship of a vigorous and intelligent NW Euro population that it has taken until now for some people to realize what a disastrous blunder it was to replace the Articles of Confederation with the Constitution.

                    I am writing a text for my family called “When did the West get fucked up?”, copying Nobel Prize Mario Vargas Llosa’s sentence: “When did Peru get fucked up?”I hate to say it because I hate controversies between Catholics and Protestants, which start a flame war and don’t go anywhere. And this is not a religious blog.But the root cause of the decadence of the West is Sola Scriptura. Not in a theological sense, because you could argue for and against Sola Scriptura inside Christianity. These are theological matters and are better done in a religious blog. I am talking about a social sense.Sola Scriptura stated that every person was entitled to interpret the Bible as he saw fit because the Holy Spirit would guide him. These, my friends, is the opposite of society. In every religion (Islam, Buddhism, etc.), there are authorized interpretations. You don’t interpret the Constitution by yourself. You don’t interpret the rules of the private company you work by yourself. This is anarchy (maybe it is God’s will but, if it it is so, God wills anarchy).Sola Scriptura makes each person the ultimate arbiter about ethics and moral. Once you feel this way, you can throw the Bible if you can. (Of course, most Protestant people are not like that, but the idea was out of the box and couldn’t be put back inside the box)This is individualism and relativism at the max. Luther never wanted that (as he reveals in his writings) but he got trapped in his own rhetoric. Then he regretted.The history of the West is the history of fighting against this relativistic individualism, which could destroy any society, no matter how sturdy it is. The fact that we lasted for so long it is due to the Industrial Revolution making us incredibly richer and individualism conquering the Western world at a slow pace.Sola Scriptura produced an explosion of Christian sects that, with the addition of previous Christians sects (the Catholic one, for example) started killing each other to see what Christian sect was entitled to rule society.Then they arrived to a truce: separation of Church and State. There was not going to be an official religion. This was absurd. Each society has an official religion because the law has to allow the good things and forbid the evil things. So every law has to be based on a concept of what is good and what is evil, and this is a religion. A religion does not need gods neither spiritual things, like some Asian religions.Since an official religion was needed and was forbidden, liberalism (the religion of freedom, equality and progress) became our official religion, because it did not appear as a religion for Western people who only knew Christianity.Liberalism seems like a relativistic religion (freedom, equality and progress are relativistic) but several political processes make it an absolutist religion that evolves to the worst things being consecrated as dogmas (I won’t bore you about this, but the last dogma that is in process of implementation is the trans ideology: a man is a woman). It is a religion that goes to the worse things.In addition, democracy was the only legitimate system of government. If you fake that there is not an official truth and that everybody has his own truth (derived from Sola Scriptura), the only way to take collective decisions is to count votes. (In reality, an oligarchy used democracy to control the masses). This is a recipe for disaster. As Jorge Luis Borges said: “Democracy, this abuse of statistics”.So we ended up with a society where each individual is theoretically the king and the Pope and no moral law exists above individuals. This is a recipe for disaster. In reality, an oligarchy rules the society (which is not bad) but they use the absence of an official moral law to replace right with might. They are unaccountable because there is no moral law agreed by the entire society to measure them. Each individual has its own moral law.I know that this is not very clear. I am ill today and the matter is way too complex to explain in a combox.

                        “Sola Scriptura stated that every person was entitled to interpret the Bible as he saw fit because the Holy Spirit would guide him.”Nope.I’d hate anyone to read what you wrote and believe it.  What you wrote is contrary to most all protestant doctrine.  (I am sure one of the thousands of denominations makes such a statement, but the majority of denominations do not and the vast majority of protestants who care about doctrine do not.)Luther wrote plenty on three Solas, to include Sola Scriptura.  He’s a good place to start.  If someone wants something a bit more contemporary and right-ish, SuperLutheran or VeryVeryLutheran podcaster(s) cover this and explicitly reject your formulation.

                        Citizen:  I agree Joe Citizen will continue to vote harder.  I’ve even seen advice to do so from surprising sources, claiming it will be a giant FU to the powers that be.  That, to me, is poor advice.    You are indistinguishable to them from any other ant, and your vaunted ‘protest vote’ is meaningless.  All that counts in the end is that you participated in their fraud, you played your role as a patsy.  Protest votes are for people who think someone up there actually notices them.   Make enough noise and some antifa drone may dox you, but protest votes don’t bother them in the least.

                        “… your vaunted ‘protest vote’ is meaningless.”True.  Meaningless as a threat to their power.  But it does have meaning!  It means *you still* believe in the myth of your power to change the system from within the system.Such a “protest” vote, oddly enough, is reassuring to TPTB.  All that is required to perpetuate your delusion is to once in a while allow a minor concession or two at the polls.  Nothing changes in the long run, but you fall asleep until the next election cycle.Not voting on the other hand…well that means you’ve quit the system, and worse you might seek other ways in which to change it.  Their grift is apparent.  You are now an unknown quantity and therefore a potential threat of sorts that must be taken into consideration.  As such numbers build, this task becomes increasingly difficult.  Hence we see all sorts of increases of the surveillance State.

No law says one can’t pay lip service to the corrupt regime and quietly “seek other ways in which to change it.” Recall TomA’s advice about being unobtrusive antibody, waiting for the fog, targets of opportunity and suchlike entities 😎

                Isn’t that so interesting? He was the giant bull, knocking into everything and destroying all of it before our eyes. Somehow he successfully and inadvertently exposed  the corruption of the system he was so desperate to join. He managed to bring to light the hatred they have for even the slightest flicker of white people advocating for their own interests.It’s just incredible that he still remains useful. And that they are stupid enough to continue to try to remove him when all it does is demonstrate their eternal hatred.

                    The stupidity angle cannot be understated. Trump easily could have been coopted by appeals to his ego but the morons decided he had to be destroyed, and in the process likely destroyed themselves.

                        That is the direct result of the hubris and arrogance of the ruling class.  When you are a sociopath of epic proportions and you believe you are above all dirt people, you do not see the logical side of things.  They are angry that he inadvertently exposed their supreme hatred of us dirt people, and by doing so, they’ve only exposed more of their corruption.That being said, the undoing of Joe Normie’s belief in the system is an incredibly difficult knot to untie.  I still have many conservative friends who think that November will bring positive change.  It is amazing how bound to the system most people are and they just cannot fathom letting go of that system.  When I explain to them that I will never vote again, they view me as someone who now loses his right to complain.  To me, it is no different than wearing a mask to please Covidius the god.  We all know the mask does absolutely nothing, but people continue to wear them to this day.  I refuse to wear a diaper on my face knowing that it does nothing to prevent the spread.  The same thing can be said of voting.  Why participate in a system that I know does not serve my interests at all, and by participating in it, I am simply propping up something that supports my extinction?

                President Trump has said something to this effect: “In reality, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I’m just in the way”.Despite any failings on his part, this remains, and indeed has become yet more the case. And this is what Joe Normie is increasingly beginning to feel.How did it get to this point? I recommend to you all to invest the time to read a multi-part posting from Sundance at The Conservative Tree House, links to follow.https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2022/08/11/part-1-why-did-the-doj-and-fbi-execute-the-raid-on-trump-the-story-behind-the-documents/#more-236386https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2022/08/11/part-2-why-did-the-doj-and-fbi-execute-the-raid-on-trump-the-evidence-within-the-documents/#more-236395https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2022/08/11/part-3-why-did-the-doj-and-fbi-execute-the-raid-on-trump-a-culmination-of-four-years-of-threats-and-betrayals/#more-236402Sundance has invested some considerable effort in understanding where we now find ourselves, as well as the actions of those who have worked to put us there, and to my reading his time was profitably spent.Given the situation, I mostly agree that we are not voting our way out of this. Sundance seems fundamentally to align with civic nationalism, but I think even he and his audience are increasingly drawing nearer to the “not voting our way out of this” perspective. I see this more and more at CTH, at Kunstler’s blog, etc.That being said, we need  to know, following Sun Tzu’s dicta, not only ourselves, but also those who oppose and oppress us if we hope to stand a chance.  In that spirit, I offer up these links to these posts from a pretty thoughtful guy who has been engaged upon understanding the enemy for years.

                        3g4me,Well, that is probably an artifact of their “Jesus loves the little children of the world” brand of Christianity, and that is unfortunate. Race realism is certainly not incompatible with Christianity, and dismissing it out of hand seems ill-considered. Oh, well.But I myself still learn from those whom I am out of sympathy with on certain matters. For instance, I am not a Catholic, but I still profit from reading Ann Barnhardt’s blog, fearsome Papist that she is. Besides her rapier wit, and cogent observations, I can truly respect her diamond one-pointedness; bless her if it gives her the strength to face – and fight – what is coming.

                        Okay, got it. Sons of Confederate Veterans.No, I am not. I don’t know my more distant genealogy well enough to know whether I may have had a Confederate  veteran among my ancestors.My mother was Pennsylvania Dutch (a tually Deitsch in their dialect of German) for generations (her grandparents spoke Pennsylvania Deitsch in their household), while my father grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, an only son of a mother from Missouri, and a father originally from Nebraska. My wife has geneological resources on tap as a university librarian that could probably unwrap the mysteries concerning my more distant forebears’ origins and culture, though, and I’d like to learn more.My sympathies do align with the  CSA with what I have learned from my studies. I am resident in the southern part of  New Jersey, a state not sympathetic to the Lost Cause, although during the WoNA it was a Copperhead state.

I agree the system would be creaking down under the weight of its own complexity even if the current regime had not been installed.
That said, Trump, or any halfway competent President and leadership class would not have taken half the acceleratory actions we’ve seen from the regime.
I won’t postulate whether collapse could be skillfully managed. I feel that requires a level of rationality mankind does not possess. The best modern example is probably the USSR, and they still endured years of penury.

                As I’ve noted before, when the USSR collapsed, they were still a people.  Yes, there were outer republics of a less than White disposition.  Some were let go, some were forcibly retained.  But the center—Russia—held!
Where is the center or tight grouping, as in Whites and Industry, in the USA?  Some will say fly over country.  Fine, but such retains little of the makings for a prosperous ethnostate wrt resources as we’ve come to expect.
Not thought this out completely as others will note, but the gist of the matter seems obvious.

I agree demographics are perhaps the key difference between the USSR and the US.
In 2010, Russia was 81% ethnic Russian.
The US hasn’t had that sort of demographic makeup since the mid, possibly even late 80s.
