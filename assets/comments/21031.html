        ‚ÄúWhite people backed the pompous and crass Trump as a rejection of official politics. A good chunk of whites were sick of the wars, the open borders, the corporate piracy. Voting for Trump was a rejection of the status quo in an effort to wake up the political class.‚ÄùAnd the GOP response to white voters was, ‚ÄúSo?‚Äù and also, ‚ÄúFuck off.‚Äù The Democrat response was, ‚ÄúDIE RACIST PIGS!!!‚ÄùSo, yeah, no voting our way out of this.

        Yes, how many examples do we need to inform us of the futility of the ballot box. It is a corrupt and fixed game for sure.Something drastically external a groundswell of our own type of rebellion will have to start to fix this but I don‚Äôt see how. Go ahead call us blackpillers but damn, what do you people who think Trump will finally win for our cause have for an argument against our assessment of the future?Wait for November when the lecherous schemers steal the election and double down on normies. McConnell and his ilk will be handmaidens to it signaling for their masters. And Trump tweets.

            I remember Kobach getting completely owned by Fredo Cuomo a few months ago.
Just because I like him personally doesn‚Äôt make him ready for primetime.

                lol, ready for prime time. Like that shit matters in a world that is going to elect Biden.
Really, though, how ready do you have to be to cast a vote to eliminate H1B visas? Come on, man.

                    I would, of course, have voted for Kobach.  That being said, I get why he lost.
Quality still matters (see Spencer, Richard B)

                        Kansas is a bifurcated state. Half the residents there are fundamentalist crazies who still think it‚Äôs 1865. Drive across that state sometime and listen to the radio.

            I really don‚Äôt understand Z‚Äôs thinking here. How many posts has he written over the years confirming that there‚Äôs no voting our way out of this? How many times and how many ways has he shown that democracy is an abysmal system and the universal franchise an abomination? Yet now he focuses on elections and the importance of supporting the right politicians. Of course McConnell and all the rest are corrupt and anti-White. We all know this. They‚Äôve locked shields against Kobach before. So why the surprise and angst now?

            The single best thing we can do to further de-legitimize a corrupted-beyond-repair political system is to join the already biggest white political party: the non voter.
It‚Äôs already almost half of eligible white voters.  If we break down the white vote to Republicans, Democrats, third party, non voter‚Ä¶the non voter party is a plurality verging on becoming the majority white party.  Stop playing sucker and legitimizing your enemies by participating and thus giving it your tacit approval.

                Not voting is a vote against the system itself.It‚Äôs not as if we‚Äôre going to actually be catered to, protected or even more mildly despised by whichever candidate we vote for.‚ÄúJust wait and see what the Democrats do, dummies‚Äù is the same shtick we‚Äôve heard since Bill Clinton‚Äôs first candidacy.If the GOP was ever going to care about Whites (it never will), it would require making them lose and letting them know why they didn‚Äôt get our votes.Falling for Rush‚Äôs ‚Äúwe just don‚Äôt have a better option‚Äù tells the GOP your vote is already in the bag, no need to actually work for your interests.  The logic of this is as plain as it can be.

                Ultimately, whether we vote or not is irrelevant to the big picture. It will take much more than YT staying home to delegitimize the uniparty. When a Hutu pack slaughters a dozen white children on a playground in the middle of a white neighborhood and posts it on Youtube, and the police refuse to get involved, the deligitimation begins in earnest.

        The difference gets more pronounced by the year. A mild immigration patriot gets his character assassinated in public by the GOP while the left treats their radicals like rich parents doting on spoiled children. When the kid acts up, they get a cookie and a pat on the head. At worst, a quiet dismissal along with a covering move to protect them. Sure there is some bickering, much of it catty, but the left remains firmly united on the same team.There should be no such delusions on the right, White men are not welcome in the republican party, unless you are a cuckold.

        OT ‚Äì but how much of the GoodWhite fervour for the shutdowns is based on the fact that they are generally miserable people who dislike their lives?
The most common theme among radical leftists is that they hate themselves and they hate others. Hence their hatred for society. Given this misery, it‚Äôs not surprising that they would want to prevent normal people from doing things.

        Precisely.  First Sessions‚Ä¶now Kobach.  The mask slipped off the Lizard people who run the high echelons of the Republican party and they are making zero effort to put it back on.In my home state, part of it is Appalachia hill country where in the primary the state GOP has rallied against the two leading contenders because one puts up quotes from Qanon and the other did not immediately disavow support from a local white nationalist (a guy nobody has ever heard of prior to his name being plastered inside the local rag).  Even better, a group called the Republican ‚ÄúPortuguese‚Äù Council (ahem) dumps money into the 3rd candidate just so the other two can‚Äôt pull it off.Again, I have no illusions on any of this crap and I‚Äôm sure the top two contenders are just grifters in training just like Mitch was back in the day.  What‚Äôs illustrative of the times in which we live is that these candidates are no doubt voicing the thoughts and opinions of their constituency but all forces above the local level have rallied together to shut those voices down, full stop.  It is a message, loud and clear: We do not care what you dirt people think or vote. We want nothing to do with you.The past four years have red pilled a whole lot of people. We are way past the ‚Äúif only the Tsar knew‚Ä¶‚Äù stage.The hope for Heritage America is in the hinterlands.

                We do know and everyone is arming up. Its like every day I see some story of ‚Äúmilitia runs of criminals‚Äù militias runs of protestors or something of that sort.The only issue is we still cling to the clown show  for lack of a better ideology.

            The U.S. as a whole has decided that mass immigration from non-European countries is great. Yes, maybe people are brainwashed and wrong, but still, they‚Äôre OK with mass immigration and that is what is happening. We are the minority that have a problem with it. It will be easy to villainize us and destroy us and as people are disappointed in the roll-out of Utopia, this will be an appreciated outlet with scapegoats. Maybe they‚Äôll make a circus out of it, along with televised Truth and Reconciliation hearings/trials, where whites are humiliated and destroyed. Wonder if they‚Äôll allow people to vote on their cell phones the preferred form of punishment, like voting for preferred dancers on Dancing with the Stars. Family fun that reinforces correct thinking!

                        Funny you mention that. Long ago,I thought I might move there (probably Mexico), but a half-dozen trips in the ‚Äô00s convince me that FL is pretty nice. It was nice to visit Mexico and Panama, and I saw some of the retirement meccas. If one wanted to go further afield (South America), yes, some of the countries, like tiny Uruguay are even Whiter than the USA, I think.I am somewhat tied to the USA, primarily by my cats üôÇ but in the meantime, I did manage to get a Spanish LIt degree. Pension is good anywhere. Once the pandemic is past, who knows‚Ä¶?

                    NBA ratings have been terrible since they restarted games.  They are seeing fewer viewers than they had in November when they were going up against football games.  The average NBA game is getting 1.5 million viewers.  Young white men in particular long ago abandoned watching sports to waste their time playing video games and watching porn.https://thesportsrush.com/nba-news-nba-ratings-crash-why-are-nba-and-mlb-ratings-at-an-all-time-low-after-black-lives-matter-protests/

Just not interested. The NHL players are increasingly taking on the average white soycuck characteristics. The days of guys like Gordie Howe have been finished since the 2013 lockout (generously).
Playing is still fun though. All white guys. The hostile aliens hate it, because it‚Äôs a whitey thing they can never take part in.

                Exactly. There are two sides and one way forward.Our side is faced with the same spiritual challenge: we have to accept that the two cohorts, suicidal whites and delusional whites, are not part of the future we will carve out of the coming chaos.From a strategic standpoint, they are already lost. Avatars of lost nation coasting on fumes.As it relates to forging a future for our people, the treasonous woke whites agitating for the brown tranny open society future and the slumbering normies daydreaming about the salad years of the empire should both be treated as hostile forces.Different threats but threats just the same.For the rest of us here we have the task at hand: sorting through our own people to suss out those with the mettle, skill, and will to build what comes next in the new frontiers of occupied Amerika. And letting people go who don‚Äôt serve this purpose.Unfortunately, many on this side still envision a future of solo silos stacked with gold and 556 where rugged patriots can run out the clock in peace and quiet.The ‚ÄúI just want to be left alone‚Äù is an understandable response to the constant assault. But it is also a mindset that helped carry us to this precipice.Now that voting is officially gay, each of us will be casting votes with our dollars and our feet.And at some point soon the secret ballot of our choices will slip away into the night as well and hiding in plain sight will be as silly as open borders mail in democracy.Might as well get started.

                    As I said don‚Äôt watch sports you don‚Äôt play. I don‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt do to injury or age mind you. Just don‚Äôt.Get out there and play hockey, hell street hockey rather than live vicariously.And yes I know that its not easy or possible in some places  but at least here in Cali martial arts studio are open with a mask. Go do that instead.Who cares of you suck. Its about you, for you and being a better man.Just as a reminder of why we are so screwed. Steam had a cooking simulator for sale  the other day. I mean really just go get damned cook book and make lunch.

                Since voting doesn‚Äôt work and they are unwilling to go to full civil war mode for a great many excellent reasons, what else can they do?Ultimately the system is dying, everyone knows that but the level of hardship the collapse of multi ethnic a continent wide or multi continent empire that is also  extremely brittle is terrifying. 90% fatality rate is quite possible.If this were actually a highly religious nation we  could cope with it fine but few empires are and we aren‚Äôt.If we had an ideology, we‚Äôd be alright but again a useful, workable one isn‚Äôt there and American‚Äôs ethnic divisions, traditional truculence and independent nature  make direct imposition improbable. They can bully and coerce while the system is intact but its too hard to force an alternate system.Now our defensive instincts are good, very good. Militias are out and about , you can watch Dr. Steve Turley‚Äôs white pilling show on YouTube for examples but we lack solidarity and offensive instincts as of yet.This can make it frustrating for us but as fast as it is all happening in historical terms , its probably better to let it go low and slow.

                the party hacks in kansas   set up their own hack  campaigns . this is a tried and true way to use money to split the opposition. because there are so many ‚Äúopposition candidates , it devides the anti- incumbent vote so the incumbent can win with way less than 50 %. this is how Lindsey grahm avoids being primaried. a friend in SC told me there were a dozen challengers on the last GOP SC primary. and Lindsey won with a little over 1/3 of the vote. In the past I have seen people win primaries with 22 % of the vote in a ‚Äù crowded Field‚Äù .The Democrats do this too. so thats why there were so many on the ballot

                This is one way the establishment cheats and a good reason  for a one or maybe two term limit. This doesn‚Äôt solve problems all that well , we have it herein Cali but better than nothing.Essentially every trick and every hack has to be thought through and prevented.A money limited, term limited, NOTA mandated , strict strong majority election system with a limited franchise might help a bit.If the future USA bothers with elections we need that  sixty percent majority requirement, run offs and with none of the above as an option.

Pat Buchanan‚Äôs 1992 run was the high water mark for us post-Hart-Celler and the Colored Supremacy Act of 1964. A legitimate GOP could have gotten behind him and turned this around ‚Äì but of course that‚Äôs not what we had.
(((Tricks))), corruption, demographics and academic factory-farm-indoctrination centers have rendered everything since an exercise in futility.
We‚Äôre 3 decades behind on a White Walkaway strategy that should have started when Republicans started calling Pat a Nazi. I got fooled along with everyone else. Not again.

                    Pat Buchanan‚Äôs 1992 run was the high water mark for usYes, indeed. I worked and prayed for Pat to at least get that nomination. I just knew that Pat in a presidential debate would be glorious.But Pat lost, and I already knew that the State was the great evil and we could not beat it. I could see no way that we would divide up the Empire and let people live in small, weak units. So, I have been waiting for the final war. The one that finally divides the empire.It is not that I am blood thirsty. It is I see no way out of the final war other than total slavery.What will come next? I don‚Äôt really know when, but I am sure it will be very violent.

                    The GOP will not change whether we walk away or not. The only reason to vote for Trump is that it likely will accelerate the viciousness of the State if somehow he gets re-elected. He won‚Äôt do anything positive for us but the resulting horrible optics would help or might help our cause.I worked very hard for Buchanan. Things were even worse then because Whites had not felt enough of the boot. Government oppression has proved to be the only way to get the attention of the masses.But, yes, it was over as far as the system after the ‚Äô92 Republican convention. The last even semi-legitimate election accidentally would be held in 2016 but the intervening 24 years finalized politics as a solution. People forget it but the first term of Clinton was friendly to immigration control but that set off the Gay Old Pedobears and the Democrat bean counters came to realize there was gold in them thar vibrants. Buchanan‚Äôs defeat resulted in a unified political front against Whites that will continue as long as the Empire maintains a central government.

        Kobach is the litmus rest of Republicans.I remember back in early 2017 when he was meeting with Trump and his list of priorities were leaked and it was everything we wanted that wasn‚Äôt a Nazi LARP. Of course, he didn‚Äôt get it because Trump was never serious about curbing immigration.Rather than being made DHS Secretary, he was assigned to investigate voter fraud. Sure enough, every state threw up a barrier to audit records. Even though that was an obvious sign that mass voter fraud did in fact take place, the study was shut down. Nothing from Trump, nothing from the all-GOP led Congress. He got shut down because they were never serious about voter fraud.Then he ran for Governor and was kneecapped every step of the way. He barely won a rigged primary. The GOP fought him harder than his opponent. We saw a repeat here in the Senate run.Kobach had an impressive resume and accomplishments prior to 2016. If people want to know if Trump and the GOP are serious about immigration and working class whites, look to Kobach. Kobach made more progress before Trump and that‚Äôs by design. If anyone needs proof that Trump is used to stamp out populism rather than bolster it, this race was the perfect demonstration.Whether people feel like voting Republican this fall or not, understand that we‚Äôre not getting nationalist populism in 2020. Voting for the GOP is not going to help us at all. I‚Äôm not an accelerationist but we‚Äôre on our own. The winks and nods and $88 merchandise from Trump are exactly that and absolutely nothing more.

        I didn‚Äôt follow this race, but does anyone know why there were 11 candidates for the Republican nomination?  Especially considering 7 of them failed to crack 2% it seems suspicious.  Was some lefty group throwing funding around?  The guy who ran 3rd, Bob Hamilton, seems like he could have been drawing voters away from Kobach.

            McConnell called the party hacks in the state and had them set up their own campaigns . this is a tried and true way to use money to split the opposition. because there are so many ‚Äúopposition candidates , it devides the anti- incumbent vote so the incumbent can win with way less than 50 %. this is how Lindsey grahm avoids being primaried. a friend in SC told me there were a dozen challengers on the last GOP SC primary. and Lindsey won with a little over 1/3 of the vote. In the past I have seen people win primaries with 22 % of the vote in a ‚Äù crowded Field‚Äù .The Democrats do this too.

        Observe, analyze, predict, and prepare. Pissing and moaning is not a solution either. At some point, the house of cards comes falling down and things will get real and visceral in a big hurry. When that happens, half the country will whine and bitch for government gravy, and the other half will quietly take the shotgun out the closet and put it by the front door. Which side do you want to be on?

            A major problem is that, although gun ownership is legal almost everywhere, long guns even in ‚Äúgun control‚Äù cities like Washingotn,  Chicago and NYC unless I‚Äôm mistaken, it is difficult to impossible to ‚Äî legally ‚Äî carry it out of your home. You can get arrested even without leaving your own property. Just ask the McCloskey‚Äôs, and this in a supposedly gun-friendly State.

                The state AG just signed an amicus brief for them and if somehow they get convicted which is very unlikely, they will have an immediate pardon from the governor.,Also as they are wealthy and mean lawyers and there is clear proof of malfeasance on the D.A.‚Äôs part  the process won‚Äôt be the  punishment. Its liable to backfire on said D.A badlyMost of us though won‚Äôt be so lucky.That said, while it won‚Äôt happen the way to prevent this mess is to limit campaign contributions and frankly personal wealth.Limit income to 100x the minimum wage via a 100% tax  and limit campaign contribution to your district/State 20 hours minimum wage per year of term  or a bit more from natural persons who are citizens,This means no more super rich (I wouldn‚Äôt even allow such as immigrants) and no more buying election as the limit would be say $400 to you rep no matter who you are and no PAC‚Äôs or anything else.This would require a Constitutional  Amendment though or a new society  but as nothing an be done in the cuurent system anyway, its worth considering for whatever comes next.And note to detractors, 1.4  million a year is plenty to live very well on in a society where no one can have more than  that and foreigners can‚Äôt own property and are restricted from entry.Prices level to meet the market.

        ‚ÄúThere is no better example of the corruption inherent in democracy than the anti-abortion movement. For generations they have been hoovering up millions and have nothing to show for it. A candidate opposing abortion may as well claim he opposes leprechauns riding unicorns. It is the most meaningless position in politics.‚ÄùOn the National level, yes.  In the local and state level they have been very effective in making life miserable for abortion facilities using administrative shenanigans.One such example:https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2020/04/10/rutledge-threatens-action-against-abortion-providerOf course, their victories will be limited until some states have the  balls to give the middle finger to corrupt judges.  The problem is that it is full of flag waving religious normies who spout stupid platitudes like ‚Äúwomen are also victims of abortion‚Äù and ‚ÄúAbortion hurts black people the most‚Äù.  They have no idea how much Washington hates them.

            Abortion doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhurt‚Äù black people the most. It prevents unwanted children from being an added burden to blacks who lack the means to raise them decently. Without the availability of abortion, single black mamas, hardly more than teens themselves, would be raising sprogs they have no desire for.I detest Planned Parenthood for having allowed the social justice cranks to take over the organization. But its original mission, providing birth control assistance, was a blessing. And while abortion is distasteful, it can be the best of a bad lot of choices.On your mark, get set, Pope megaphoners and womb crusaders! See how many ways you can tell me I‚Äôve bothered your feelings.

                A very much ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù dliemma, abortion. You make a very valid point though. About 1/2 of Black pregnancies are terminated.

                    Truth is you want to fix our social ills, don‚Äôt ban abortion. Ban single mommies, easy divorce when there are kids (without kids in most cases no Alimony)   and make custody default to the male.In a generation or two if there is work for the less skilled that pays  enough for family formation and you‚Äôll have a managable crime level.Problem is even though long term its a suicidal ideology Capitalism hates intact families since they more efficiently use resources than singletons and demand decent pay.Fundametallt the current economize system must be made to serve the nation period or the nation will die,

                Get off your high and mighty horse, Gravity.  No, abortion is not merely distasteful ‚Äì it is deliberate murder of a child-to-be.  However, I recognize that fewer of other races being born to grow into full savagery and anti-Whiteness is a good thing.  I am also cognizant that this is an inherently contradictory opinion ‚Äì that I am essentially condoning the murder of non-White babies.  And yes, for now, that is my choice, based always on ‚ÄúWhat is best for White people?‚Äù

                    Planned Parenthood was actually outed by the hidden video guy, forget his name, as accepting donations earmarked for blacks.  Can you imagine if they weren‚Äôt at the center of the establishment?  They sure memory holed that video.  A lot of people don‚Äôt realize that blacks are entirely reactive.  Nothing they do is proactive.  Are they responsible enough to take a pill every day?  Actually no.  Thats why Norplant is great and they should get free wings every day for getting it.  The wings would pay for themselves times 1000, including the bbq sauce.

                    3g4me,Good for your honesty and self-awareness. You seem to be one of those rare people who get it that trade-offs and mixed motives are part of life.Maybe I understated the grim reality in calling abortion ‚Äúdistasteful.‚Äù Although pregnancy in very early stages involves a tiny fetus, there is no objective way to determine when the soul enters and the fetus becomes a ‚Äúbaby.‚Äù So I won‚Äôt debate it. But abortion in, say, the first trimester hardly is murder.After that, it does get ugly. So we should impose limits on the stage in which pregnancy can be terminated.Instead of pushing ‚Äúabortion rights,‚Äù society should be multiplying availability of birth control and sterilization. Both are better answers. But suitably limited abortion is preferable to the alternatives in specific cases, particularly where the mother can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt provide a nurturing atmosphere.I know ‚Äî adoption. I don‚Äôt much follow the stats on this, but my impression is that there is a huge overhang of babies waiting for adoption. A lot of them are black. Other than entertainment show-offs and virtue signaling white families, there isn‚Äôt much of a market for them.

Blacks as a group hate our guts and want us destroyed while we sit around virtue-signaling about them choosing to have abortions.
Too many white people are too gutless.

Also, Margaret Sanger was on to the reality of blacks and the benefits of not having more of them in your society. Pining for the ability to see reality as they did in the 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs, 40‚Äôs. Whereas now we all live in a society of lies and misdirection. Yes, a harsh correction may be coming, but they may take out whites before they come round to taking out blacks.

        The three I‚Äôs,  a good one. And totally true.I am a Christian and against abortion but just like many other organizations in the 21st century claiming to represent conservatives the Right to Life does not serve my interests.I see that now.

            There are indications that the Treasury/Fed are planning to try negative interest rates in order to manage the cash flow from all the debt they will incur. To prevent a run on the banks, they will need to impose a digital dollar to eliminate cash. People will be forced to exchange paper dollars for digital dollars at exchange rates that become more unfavorable over time. I think this will be a disaster domestically. If you think PayPal exerts control over financing non-PC political beliefs, the digital dollar is PayPal on steroids. I think it will be shunned by large numbers of overseas dollar users because of the control it gives the US government over prohibiting transactions. This is possibly hoe the US dollar gets dethroned as the world‚Äôs reserve currency.

                This was considered but I suspect it will be rejected. There is too much debt and if you essentially forbid savings, alternatives will arrive , assets changed to crpto  will get much bigger or the money will flow into things like food or ammo.A ban on ammo won‚Äôt happen for risk of kaboom.The real risk is of such rates is that bills will get quickly paid off and borrowing will slow further.I can‚Äôt earn any interest, fine I pay of the house and car and credit cards and stop spending.Its not possible in time of high debt and saturated markets to make people spend . Buying things like an extra can of beans or more soap  won‚Äôt raise red flags.A lot of this nonsense  comes from Keynesian thinking and the very corrupt idea that people are entitled to live off interest. This concept destroys societies that try it.Neither a borrower nor a lender be,For loan oft loses both itself and friend,And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.This above all: to thine own self be true,And it must follow, as the night the day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.

            The world can‚Äôt turn on the dollar, There are no alternatives to it including the yuan . Gold and even Silver  isn‚Äôt going to work either, there isn‚Äôt enoughNearly every economy is hell bent on more production  for which there is no one to consume.There is not going to be a service recovery or an entertainment recovery . Media will still happen but that 5 billion Disney lost last quarter is the new normal.Ultimately more totalitarian money control won‚Äôt help as very few babies are being born to anyone with an IQ of 90+ and there is so much debt the velocity of money is nil.You also have lower wages and higher unemployment for decades to come.Trust me on this, baring revolution or collapse debt holders  aren‚Äôt going to  sit there and not be be paid so every dollar they are owed.This means the velocity of money is in deflation f that no digital dollar can help that till consumer debt is paid off in 5-10 years.Fundamentally the only thing the bankers can do is try and keep stocks high for institutional investors and hope that something happens to prevent a collapse into chaos.

One of the major problems with conservative solidarity is pundits and their ilk will  go out their way to attack each other just to show who is the true believer and hence so much wiser than the common folk.Democrats on the other hand close ranks and support one another which is commendable due to their belief that this is war.We are battling for the sake of our children and country so act accordingly goddammit.

        Lots of good points, Z. While disheartening, Kobach‚Äôs loss hardly was surprising. Key things:Of course, President Trump did nothing to support Kobach. Instead he spent his time tweeting about something.Trump was strong-armed to endorse Marshall and did not, which we are expected to accept as a victory of some sort because he endorsed Romney and other disgusting cucks.Mitch McConnell organized a $15 million ad campaign against Kobach. The ads claimed he was a white nationalist who employed invisible Nazis on his staff. It is a great example of how today‚Äôs heated rhetoric from the Left becomes conservative dogma tomorrow. No one should be surprised if the GOP slips in some language into their platform condemning your ancestors and supporting the black lives matter nonsense.McConnell is not an outlier in betrayal of Whites, which says it all. And yes to your last full sentence. The GOP‚Äôs constant need to suck up to blacks cannot be satisfied with recitation of BEST BLACK EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS EVER! in the midst of a Depression.The other interesting McConnell angle is that he now runs the GOP.One hundred percent. The Republican Party needs to burn to the ground.There is no better example of the corruption inherent in democracy than the anti-abortion movement. For generations they have been hoovering up millions and have nothing to show for it. A candidate opposing abortion may as well claim he opposes leprechauns riding unicorns. It is the most meaningless position in politics.It is a full-blown sham and always has been. On the bright side, the ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù movement‚Äôs grifting and failures have caused us to have 20,000,000 fewer blacks and browns among us. That also is a Pyrrhic victory since the floodgates will be opened again soon to compensate.Instead of cutting a deal with Trump, which would be easy, they are working with their friends in the GOP to undermine Trump at every turn.They could have sucked up to him and gotten anything. Hell, they almost did anyway. The only reason Trump remains viable in any way is because more deals weren‚Äôt cut for President Kushner to sign.In the fullness of time, the 2016 election will be viewed as the last legitimate presidential election in America.I‚Äôve written and said this the last four years. Essentially, even 2016 was an accident. It also is a stretch to call it legitimate given what we know about FBI and IC interference.Regardless of what happens this fall, it is over, and it has been over for a long time now.

        Trump is a pompous ass who only cares about himself, Israel and the immediate family. He is a textbook example of the Peter Principle where you rise to your level of incompetence. I am sick of always voting for the lessor of two evils.That said, I am going to hold my nose and vote for him again. For all his lack of desire to help the people who voted for him, he at least lives in reality and I hope to have one last chance to see the insane and vicious Democrats lose their mind again and have the Republican ruling class frustrated for the last time. They won‚Äôt care about the US becoming a one party nation with only democrats getting into the presidency. Plus he is the first president since Carter to not start a war and unlike the Democrats and RINOs he doesn‚Äôt hate us.

        How many of you people, obviously intelligent thinkers, think you‚Äôll be alive 4 years from right now?  The next question, If you think you will be, how do you plan on making that happen? Perhaps by not voting?  Perhaps by reading blogs that lead you like sheep to the slaughter?  All this hyperbole leading up to a national election is nothing new.  Only the names change every four years.  If you think voting won‚Äôt matter then stay at home and clean your guns, and count your bullets.  You‚Äôre gonna need them.  Man up and vote.  What have you got to lose? ‚Ä¶If you don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶maybe your country

            That‚Äôs one side of the coin.  The other is of course that it encourages and reinforces ‚Äúthe system‚Äù‚Äîby legitimizing it.  By voting one reinforces the lie that your vote counts and in having that small portion  of decision power given to you by your ‚Äúfranchise‚Äù, you are in some form ‚Äúbound‚Äù by such populous decision making.If you are too lazy or stupid to spend the time casting a considered vote, I tend to agree with you.  But if you are finally fed up with a system that no longer works in your best interest and is observably corrupt, then a person of integrity removes himself from the farce and finds other ways to live with integrity within a society he no longer can be a part of.

        Yes indeed, ‚Äúthere is no solution to that problem at the ballot box.‚Äù
And so the eternal darkness descends, or men fight the overlords. Which will it be?
The people yearn for a leader and yet there are none to be found. The only hope for white people at the present seems to be Putin‚Äôs Russia. They are white, traditional, and Christian. Perhaps whites can exist there.

        I agree with most of the points. Ballot box looks unlikely. BUT Fact, they are determined to get rid of trump.  They want x and i hate them, therefor I will vote for trump. Grug.    Politics is in real state of flux. half of whites don‚Äôt vote.  What would happen if whites became aware of the racialist program being run on them and 75% started voting?  At the least, a couple of white advocates would get elected and they would get into the fight of protecting white interests.  Soros would endorse the advice of the Z and exile on this issue.  They both working on right-wing voter suppression.  That should give them pause if nothing else.

                Both are very good at framing issues and being persuasive.  Influence.  Our numbers are small (too small to effect legitimacy of election) but the ideas are getting out.

                Randy Weaver left cities and society to live as he saw fit and raise his family that way. The law enforcement authorities came after him, repeatedly, until he took their bait. Then they destroyed his family, killing his wife and son. Keep this in mind. They will not allow you to live separately and will force diversity and God knows what else on to those who try. I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but don‚Äôt think so. I think the unrolling of Utopia will be so disappointing that they will depend on chasing down dissident whites to make examples of them to rally their pro-utopian supporters. Maybe if the country becomes so broken they will not be able to persecute whites the way they want, but that‚Äôs a big IF. More likely the whites are villainized and destroyed, publicly for viewing pleasure and enforcing social norms.

Demography and all that.Technology like the morning after pill has rendered them obsolete so shutting down the few remaining clinicians in areas where they are active is futile. And yes while I am opposed to illegal acts   the  anti abortion people were willing to fight on all levels for what they believed and are still fighting, losses and all.if we had their fighting spirit and more importantly as simple and understandable a goal set. we‚Äôd be farther alongWe lose because we don‚Äôt know what we want and think we can keep the comfy rat utopia we live in.We can‚Äôt.Anything that gets to close to the the rat utopia or that it touches dies, even Evangelicals are not much higher fertility  than everyone else and with little retention.As I noted before I‚Äôm not a fan of Dreher and his Benedict Option but he is correct  unless you consciously opt out, the rat utopia will stop fertility and abortion or no, say goodbye to grandkids.This does mean the the DR has to embrace social conservatism of some kind even if it rankles us or even if its unpopular.The only other option is basically survival mode  for the decline. Got militia?

                I think their heart is in the right place, and they are trying to play 3-D chess to end abortion. But they are fighting a losing battle. I used to think if we could get a majority on the Supreme Court, we could overturn Roe v Wade. But then Kennedy happened. Then Roberts happened. Who‚Äôs next? Even if Roe was overturned, it would kick it back to the states, and we are right back to the McConnell uniparty that will make sure it stays legal, even as they fool us with their antiabortion rhetoric every four years.

                They don‚Äôt merely oppose abortion ‚Äì what put me off early on was their resulting celebration of single motherhood.

        If there truly is no solution at the ballot box (and I fear Zman is correct, there isn`t), then we are in for some really bad times. In my wildest dreams I did not imagine things could come unglued so fast. But there is no point in lamenting the situation ‚Äî the question is, what can we do (other than move to a very remote area and stock up with ammo).? I really don‚Äôt know. Suggestions welcome.
Meanwhile, I am looking at property in remote locations, just in case.

            It doesn‚Äôt matter where you live, if they want you, they‚Äôre going to get you. I think we have to look to a world that hates us but is getting harder to function. The entropy to keep globohomo neoliberalism going is increasing exponentially. We‚Äôre getting closer to a point where even third world Latinos would sooner stay in Guatemala than make the trek north. Mexico has only become less stable since AMLO got elected; if you risk gang rape and maybe getting reassigned to a mega lab making fentanyl and crystal methamphetamine, you‚Äôre going to stay put.Alex McNabb on TRS wrote a good essay on the population implosion where even the third world cesspools are struggling to meet TFR. Except Africa and realistically there‚Äôs no way to move a billion of them to the US. There‚Äôs Europe but even these days many of them end up being shark food. Peak migration may hit in the next decade or two. Then afterwards it‚Äôs a decline as there‚Äôs not much in the way of third world refuse to ship over.I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that even though there‚Äôs a lot of damage, we‚Äôre better off within society than a bunker that makes good fodder to justify further speech and firearm restrictions. We live here, we don‚Äôt retreat. Even though the 2020 elections are a total joke, I‚Äôm still optimistic in the long term. White people are still going to win, no thanks to Trump.

                I am not as optimistic as you about immigration tailing off. I hope you are right, but the quality of life in the various cesspools is so low, and the levels of ignorance so high, that they may just keep on coming. The logical response is to sink the ships, defend the borders, but obviously that is not going to happen.You make an excellent point, this is our home, and eventually there wlll be nowhere to run, so no sense in running, appealing as the notion is.I guess this is leading to the inevitable conclusion that, at some point soon, we are going to have to fight. I am not trained or mentally prepared to do so, but the alternative is surrender, which has no appeal at all.But fight how? With what? I am sure millions of people are asking themselves these questions now, and looking for answers. I don‚Äôt have answers ‚Äî yet ‚Äî but I will keep looking.

        Ultimately McConnell‚Äôs money machine would be useless against people who have even one firing brain cell in their heads.  They sit there, brain dead, eating five layer Costco bean dip, believing every commercial they see on Fox News.  Right down to the hat with lights in it that regrows hair.  The GOP is basically the political version of that product.  And as we know, the smartest people from Kansas are FROM Kansas.  You have to be extra stupid to just sit there in that part of the country without saying, why am I here?  Iowans are no different.  Idiots Out Wandering Around.

            It‚Äôs easy to blame the voters. Sure, it is frustrating to see whites foolishly line up for another fleecing by ConInc. The nothing is though, that‚Äôs a given. The one thing the radicals have always had right is the people need to be led. they will not find the right answer on their own. Conservatives, when they were actually conservative, never got this truth.

                That‚Äôs absolutely true.  But the one quirk about human nature is that they don‚Äôt want to be led.  Not superficially.    Democracy only gives wants.  Never needs.  So the voters are like five year olds being asked what they want for dinner.  They either shout Pizza! or Hot Dog!, never what‚Äôs good for them.

        If ‚Äúthe people have spoken‚Äù and they chose a political whore over someone with a principle, then our issue is with the right-leaning rabble, not Democracy. There was no voter fraud, just as there was none in Alabama a few weeks ago. The right-leaning people just voted for the guy the media men told them to do. These people are just as able, as they were in 2016, to shock the country and vote for the chaos candidate, yet they have retreated back into conventional, establishment, comfortable Marco Rubio types. Why? If they‚Äôre this stupid, then I can see why some people want an overthrow of the system to be replaced with a Strongman. But remember we hate the far left for wanting to impose themselves as well.

We‚Äôre always told ‚ÄúVote GOP because the Democrats are even worse.‚Äù No they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre literally the same, and I don‚Äôt mean that in a ‚Äúby literally I mean figuratively‚Äù sense like most people use that word. I mean literally.

I‚Äôm not going to vote Democrat, but I‚Äôm not going to voteRepublicanDemocrat either.

        What you don‚Äôt get is that Kobach is very unlikeable and a confirmed loser. Two years ago he let a terrible, far-left woman walk into the governor‚Äôs office and she‚Äôs been a total disaster so far ‚Äî all because Kobach was so repugnant to average Kansans. Trust me, this is a good result. Now the senate seat will not go into the hands of the commies, and Kobach can return to the Trump administration where he can be useful instead of destructively losing winnable elections.

                If there‚Äôs no political solution, it‚Äôs all farce. Might as well have a reality TV star as president. He‚Äôll put on a good show. Might as well have the establishment take down a populist to get the audience riled up.

Voteing is like going to a whorehouse that only has two whores. One is white, fat and ugly. The other is black, fat and ugly. And they both smell bad. Plus you know from past experience, that no matter which one you pick, she‚Äôs going to slip you a mickey and steal your wallet. Later you‚Äôll wake up in an alley in your underwear. But it‚Äôs the only whorehouse in town.

This sufficiently demoralizes GOP voters and allows the region to go purple. Then in the general elections, the GOP further sabotages its own open borders globalist in favor of the Dem‚Äôs open borders globalist.This allows the GOP to retreat comfortably into being minority globohomo yes men. They would rather kill themselves than be ‚Äúreformed‚Äù into something like Le Pen‚Äôs National Rally, so let‚Äôs help them kill themselves.The GOP is terrified of the populist groundswell from 2016 and wants to stamp it out at all costs.The GOP cannot be reformed or converted, people.

                It‚Äôs best to view the claim that someone ‚Äúisn‚Äôt likeable‚Äù as shorthand for ‚Äúhas a poor sense of social timing.‚Äù Bevin made the mistake of imposing austerity on the teacher‚Äôs pension fund during an election year, which led to teachers striking en masse multiple days throughout the school year, causing voters with school age children to deal with lots of headaches. Now, austerity was inevitable given the state‚Äôs finances, but an election is the absolute dumbest time to impose it, which is basically what people mean when they say

        Kind of off topic, but I watched that Trump interview on HBO that came out a few days ago, and I gotta say ‚Äì the man is a retard. I‚Äôm sorry and I know this sounds a lot like ‚Äúorange man bad‚Äù and ‚ÄúTDS‚Äù but there‚Äôs just no way around it. He is as incoherent as Biden, if not more so. He‚Äôs far too argumentative, and too damn full of himself to admit any mistakes. My foreign-born girlfriend has a larger vocabulary than this shmuck. And what‚Äôs with the hand movements? Everything about this guy is posturing.

            Trump is never the issue. The issue is always his opponent. Trump is a means to defeat the truly awful neoconservatives and communists who control much of Washington. If you vote for Biden, you will get a maoist dictatorship. So hold your nose and vote your interests.

                    Trump was obviously appeasing Sheldon Adelson and that community with his appointment of Bolton, no? That community does not mind showing us the control they have over our leaders. When they ruled in Egypt, they were called the Hyksos, meaning foreign rulers. Semite scholars at first tried to tell whites that Hyksos meant shepherd of the people. Typical!Wish Ivanka and Jared were not there, but poor Trump wants a couple people around him who he can trust, since Congress, the government, media and institutions are all against him. Too bad Trump and his children are all zionists.

                The OP has a point. Trump appointed arch neoconservative John Bolton as his NSC head; he almost gave us a war earlier this year, probably interrupted only by the coronavirus. Trump IS an imbecile who has accomplished nothing while making the situtation much worse for our side.Why are we always having to choose between two bad choices? Does voting even matter at this point? Trump and the republican party are permanently out of office by 2024 anyway due to demographics, so what does 2020 matter for? We aren‚Äôt voting our way out of this. Thinking otherwise just demonstrates boomer loyalty to a dead system which oppresses you.

                    Hear hear. I‚Äôm hardly thrilled with Trump, but there are two extremely compelling reasons to vote for him. First, his reelection would deny AWRs the gratification of seeing him removed from office. Second, his reelection would inflict immense mental torment on our enemies. That is more than enough for me.

Your self-assurance is erealavent. Pres. Trump was elected as a disruptor. 63 million Americans voted to throw a monkey wrench at the establishment. And so far he‚Äôs done a damn fine job. They also wanted a better economy and got it. If it wasn‚Äôt for the Kung Flu, he would have been reelected in a landslide.
