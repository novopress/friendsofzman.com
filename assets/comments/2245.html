        “Fake Indian doesn’t roll deep.”
Ah, no, she is a ‘deep roller’ in the Hannibal Lector sense. She will stay with her predilections all the way into the ground taking us with her.
This kind of fool is especially dangerous.

        The two fake (dot, not feather) Indians that we desis talk about are Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley, both who who are believed to have converted to Christianity in their youth(as well as married mainstream type white peeps in adulthood) as part of their long term political plans.While they are ethnically “real” Indians, we question their motives.  While “Bobby” is a nick name in India (as is “Pinky”) it is pronounced Boh-bhee and anyhow Bobby is not his birth name given to him by his parents.Nikki is also not the “real” name of Nikki Haley.Way back when these two were kids Indians were more of a minority in the US and Indian names were considered weird and hard to pronounce.  Not really the case anymore.  Heck, Indian culture is considered cool and ecclectic now with Bollywood, Indian dance, Yoga, Buddhism and Ganesh becoming popular.Perhaps that is why congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard took her oath on the Bhagavad Gita and proudly proclaims her Hindu roots.But here’s the catch – she’s not Indian!Our Indian-American politicians seem out of touch and ashamed of their Desi roots while non-Indians are embracing our culture.Oh the irony of it all.

        As a real one, I’ve seen Professional Native Americans all my life and how they play on their real or imagined ancestry to leverage themselves.  Self-promotion is the game.  Chief Walking Eagle will go far.

        It’s Warren. (Feather). A fine example of political chicanery.

        Who is “fake Indian”?  Dot or feather?
Nikki Haley?
Maybe someday I’ll run and represent Desi Pride World Wide.  I won’t fake convert to a bogus religion either.  Why should I?  With Yoga and Buddhism so popular in the US, I can win on that alone.
Remember the OMbama advert in Yoga Magazine years ago?  That despite he’s a Christian of all things?!  He supposedly carried a Hanuman trinket in his pocket but that is not enough.
I’m set to bring some shuddh desi ghee into the caste iron pot 😉
Namaste!Jai Hind!Jai Mata Di!

            Fake Indian is America’s next president, Elizabeth “Granny” Warren. Despite looking like Eva Braun’s grandmother, she passed herself as a squaw to get tenure at Harvard.
