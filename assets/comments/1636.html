        “That means the typical black guy should hate himself 25% of the time.”
Oh my hell I think I just pulled something laughing.

        I wonder what percentage of Americans are descended from slave owners?
I’m of European background (white) but my parents did not come to America until the 1960’s. I really have no desire to pay reparations.

            The slave owning class in the South was quite small. Less than 20% of whites in slave states owned slaves or were involved with slavery. Immigration and population genetics tells us the heirs of that 20% are a tiny portion of the white population today. It is less than 5% and maybe as low as 2%.
Interestingly, black Americans have a high amount of European DNA now. It is roughly 25% and growing. That means the typical black guy should hate himself 25% of the time.

        I don’t feel guilty or obligated to their race. They have had every opportunity to step forward and athletics has made a large number of them millionaires.That being said I wouldn’t mind giving them a place for themselves with the caveat that this is where they stay.Detroit, SF/Oakland, and New Orleans come to mind.I certainly don’t want to be labeled a racist with these comments, I am just laying out options versus my taxes paying for something I had nothing to do with.I know where you are going with the post,I just don’t agree with the solution.

        maybe the  whites are racked with guilt can setup their own fund to pay reparations? I wonder how many liberals would pitch in? Probably close to zero considering they seldom practice what they preach.
