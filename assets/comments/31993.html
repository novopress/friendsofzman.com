        the sober minded in both parties……Unfortunately I recognize no such factions. Lest I occasionally “forget” or be distracted, last night I received two strong messages that I live in what is now the Evil Empire. The first was watching Tucker Carlson’s interview with Tara Readehttps://youtu.be/8SwvBVKwBHo?si=v5s72-1RVmjhO06uThe second was reading the text of the letter from the 12 RINO senators to the ICC. “Target Israel and we will target you…. You have been warned.”Now I have seen my share of sternly worded letters, but I have never seen a group of GOPers get so worked up in writing about anything, certainly not anything that would represent or fight for their ostensible constituents’ interests. If only they ever did or could.It’s enough to make a person think harder about expatriation. Although I’ve already “sorted” myself within AINO.

            To have lived to see American dissidents forced to seek political asylum in Moscow is…quite something.

                It used to be quite a thing. Lee Harvey Oswald was the most famous, but he was one of a million “reverse defectors” who flocked to the USSR untildestalinizatsiyarendered Russia’s communism toonot realfor Western leftists. The revolution was a takeover of Russia by the West—the first neocon war?—and the Russians were always slowly undoing it. But even the early Soviets didn’t treat commie asylum-seekers well, becausetrue believers have no value after the revolution—as Trotsky learned, pointedly. Anglo rightists mistaking Putin’s Russia for a home will meet a similar fate. “Exiled American shitposter dies of natural causes while imprisoned for racism.”

                    The earlier defectors to Russia did so for ideological reasons. These do it to escape prosecution for political crimes (Snowden, Reade, so forth). There might have been incidences of this earlier but I cannot recall them.
Agree about Anglo Rightist defections to contemporary Russia for ideological reasons, though. While he has no tolerance for sexual perverts, he’s pretty much a SJW on radical equalitarianism.

                    I like your BFE (Blackberry Fruitcake Empire) thing but you should spell out the acronym more often for the noobs. Speaking of which – has Z or anyone posted a glossary of all the sarcastic in-jokes we use here? I admit even I’m sometimes baffled by a new bit of jargon. Tubman D.F. puzzled me at first until my Spanglish kicked in.

                            I’m slipping.   I thought you were referring to the remote place in Egypt– made sense, though I didn’t think Israel had been making noises about re-occupying the Sinai.   Thanks for the clarification!

                We are an occupied country.  It cannot be denied.
But it is denied, by everyone that I know in person.
Due to centuries of evolution in high trust societies, whites are gullible and vulnerable to absolute manipulation by the hegemonic media.
While will not wake up while that media can program them.  Sad, but true.
The only solution is tp destroy the hegemonic media.  Which is hard to do.

                It did cross my mind that since the sentiment expressed in the letter is standard republican, rino is no longer applicable. Let it be so. My mistake, for the last time. But any republicans who dissent, i.e. Massie, deserve a better label than that one which is so tarnished.

                They’re much worse than mere criminals. Evergreen:“It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.” — C.S. Lewis, The Humanitarian Theory of PunishmentAlthough I now think Lewis was giving them too much credit for thinking that “our own good” factors into it at all. They’re purely Satanic. Destruction and degradation for their own sake. We’re ruled by Wormwood and his minions.

            Defense of Israel and Jews is a White American thing.First, most White Americans take pride in the liberation of the camps in 1945, they were the good guys, and like to view themselves as an action hero in a movie that never ends. This is just who Americans are for better and worse.Second, the Jewish population in the US has been viewed favorably and until recently been very Americana-ish. It was Jews who mostly created the modern Hollywood and mostly created the Comic Book. You don’t get more Americana than Superman and Captain America, or “Yankee Doodle Dandy” and other Jewish produced stuff that celebrated America as the best nation to have ever existed, including Westerns, Action Movies, Cop Movies, etc. Between people they like: Mel Brooks, Jerry Seinfeld, and people they don’t (screaming Muslim women chanting “Death to America!” and calling for jihad) its an easy choice.Third, and this is critical, with the end of America and Western Nations and the rise of Globalist Extended Stay Hotels, people seek a Global Tribe. There is no nation, or possibility of national interests or policy, just masses of people circulating around the globe in migration that never stops. This is why BLM instinctively celebrated 10/7 on the day of it; and why Whites instinctively wanted Israel to wipe Gaza/Hamas (same difference) off the map. Everyone views it as a global struggle between non-Whites to wipe out Whites and vice-versa. Like a Comanche raid in 1850’s Texas transported to now.Biden/Obama has inevitably sided with Team Non-White. Aid to Gaza, witholding “offensive weapons” (whatever that means) and inevitably, a war against Israel (which is coming, sooner or later from Biden/Obama). MOST of Corporate America, the CIA/State/Soros, various ethnic groups etc. are on Team Non-White. The sanctions against the ICC, no-fly lists for protestors, are like the North African Campaign. Not an engagement against the core of the enemy but feeling-out campaigns against extended enemy forces. This stuff is popular with Team White, puts Team Non-White on the backfoot, and starts to peel off most (not all) Jews as the “You Don’t Mess With the Zohan” Adam Sandler strategy ends.**In the movie, Jews and Arabs unite in their shared aspect of having no vowels, only consonants, against White people whom they mutually hate. As lacking self-awareness it was hilarious but encapsulated the old, failed strategy of Jews in the West circa say, 1967-2023. October 7 really was a game changer in ways still being understood, as a way for the Global Teams to sort themselves out.

            From my perspective I was suprised really. Thought the neocons were already long dead.  Did see some of the O’ll miss videos but bruh.. that’s like the last vestiges of 90% white society in pockets that will not even exist anymore in 10 years or so. (barely any exist now, Dearborn Michigan etc., America is big, pockets of ignorance and innocnence remain but.. the summer children of media brained remnants who are still… somehow? not aware of what America has become.. I really hope none of them become cannon fodder for ZOG.Summer goy children, grew up in a time warp style 1950s suburbia walled garden that is like 20% or less of that vast majority of modern white youth experience.White people need to take our own side, and we need to have started doing that 6 decades ago. Never too late to do something but shit man. How the hell could you watch Santa Inc. and still not get it? Bruh. We really need to get harder on the simps and cowards. Give them wedgies or w/e(make fun of ther stupidity and cowardice, in a paternal way pf course but, time is short, get serious). Anything it takes.History is moving again, it is time for courage.

        The Trotskyites (let’s call them what they are) have shown an incredible ability to adapt, and therefore they should not be underestimated. They may be on the outs with the Democrats, or at least their POC coalition, but they own the GOP with their Christian Zionist proxies, as the events of last week demonstrated. Trump may not be entirely under their control, but they will have significant influence in the unlikely event he wins, both through their control of Congress, and the cryptos who will no doubt burrow into his administration.The reason they keep coming back, after so much demonstrable failure, is that they are backed by kosher finance, which is not going anywhere. Until that issue is somehow addressed we are stuck with them, by whatever name they call themselves.

            The neocons were also able to make a convincing case that their interests aligned with America’s, even if it wasn’t entirely correct. During the Cold War, this is obvious. After 9/11, they were able to successfully rile up anti-Muslim animus and say that we had to “fight them there so they don’t come here.” This really isn’t the case anymore. Maybe a case could have been made in early 2022 that the USA supporting Ukraine was a good idea, but continuing to do so is just madness. This idea that Putin will march on Paris if he wins is just crazy and not even the people saying it believe it. The case is even worse for the USA’s support of Israel’s horrific campaign in Gaza. Anyone paying attention can see that supporting Israel and Ukraine has eroded our status in the world and is leading to an unraveling of the “rules based order”, on top of being totally unsuccessful. So, it will be interesting to see what happens next. This idea that the USA government and the USA military are tools in the hands of people with no loyalty to the country, no real attachment to the soil, no sense of duty to the people they rule over, is quite new. The idea that the USA government is obligated to carry out the desires of these people even at the cost of American citizens and American interests is unchartered territory.

                Taylor and Kersey went off on this tendency for the right (particularly types like Hannity and Bongino) about their exaggeration. Their response to it was absurd, but that is typical of most anymore it seems.Don’t turn banksters into ubermenschen. They can and do finance wars and fuel inflation. But how much power do they really have over your life? Not all that much, unless you you ran up the credit cards or otherwise chose to live a high-time preference lifestyle. So groceries cost you a bit more. God made it possible to have a garden or raise chickens or rabbits. If you choose not to avail yourself of His gifts, you can’t really blame the Jews.

        This just shows why it is wrong to open your borders to the world.  All these Jews bring their ethnic grudges with them and try to make their ethnic grudge our ethnic grudge, not to mention their ethnic ties to Israel into our ethnic ties with Israel.Why can’t we just have normal diplomatic relations with Israel?  Because we brought in all these Jews who love Israel so much they will not live there.  What the heck is an “American Zionist?”  If you’re a Zionist, WHY do you live in America?  Ben Shapiro loves Israel so much he won’t even move there.They don’t have dual loyalty. They have a single loyalty, to Israel or to their fellow coethnics.   Every single one who has ever publicly proclaimed any loyalty to either Israel or their group should be deported immediately or at bare minimum, be barred from government, media or lobbying.

                So your defense of Jews is to look at their liberals?  Also, they don’t hate Israel. They support Israel. They support the aid. Liberal Jews is why they get aid.Also, I never say “The Jews” I would not say “The Jews” are evil because so many elite Jews are evil just as I would never accuse White people as being evil because so many White elite are evil.But this is also why we should not have allowed them in or after we let them in allow them into the elite.  They are not us.  It’s not just them. There are all kinds of ethnic groups in the US who are not American and who bring their crappy culture and interests with them. They vote their coethnics into power. They speak foreign languages. They celebrate their own holidays and try to make them our holidays. A White kid was suspended and IIRC, arrested for wearing an American flag shirt to school because it was Cinco De Mayo. This was in America.

        The death of neo-connery (as opposed to Sean Connery who is the second best James Bond, Roger Moore being the best), is largely a function of demographics.There simply are not enough White people to go around, and the White people who do exist are functionally if not already a minority and a despised and hated one at that who don’t create enough free cash to fund neo-connery.So the old hatreds no longer apply: Russians, Communism, etc. in this the Global Age.Nations and the capitalist / communist struggle no longer really exist. Does America still exist? No. Does Capitalism exist anywhere ? No, its socialism or fascism all the way down, with much of the West being objectively fascist, just with hippiedom trappings as the Dead Kennedy’s warned in the 1970s.We don’t have the excess wealth that can be taxed and siphoned off for neo-connery stuff like a whacking great big military under Reagan, or a 600 ship navy, or massive aerospace spending. Pretty much most of Federal / State / Local spending is on the massive and constantly increasing “immigrants” who must be massively subsidized to “top up” their standard of living to the legacy White population. Who declining, must support both the massive social spending to their detriment: New York State just announced a massive expansion of JFK Airport with NO WHITE GUYS allowed to bid for contracts. Women and non-Whites only.No money, no men. Just Global Tribes under the Colors of Benetton which has not turned out the way the creators of it thought it would.

                I prefer George Lazenby. A pity he did only one Bond film, although it was the best ever made. Hippy/dippy fool that he was, he believed that 007 was doomed in the Age of Aquarius, and therefore abandoned ship. He’s regretted it the rest of his life.

It is not just the quality of neocons went down but the quality of Jews went down in general. These days US Universities are filled with Jewish academics, who came there because of accomplishments (and connections) of their parents and grandparents.

        Last year I listened to an interview Glenn Greenwald had with Norman Finkelstein, and Finkelstein discussed how his parents came here after the war, were freed from the concentration camps by the Russian army, and as such felt a lifelong debt and gratitude to Stalin and the Russians. So, is it any surprise that Finkelstein is strongly against the neocon projects? Glenn Greenwald is, too, a Jew who has spent his entire career in journalism fighting the neocons. So yes, the distinction Z makes is extremely important and he provided a very clear and concise overview of this dynamic.Since 2016, the Democrat Party’s actions have just been totally bizarre, and this lines up to the time when neocons were moving back to that party. Democrats blamed “the Russians” for Clinton’s loss, with no evidence, and in spite of that lack of evidence, used them as a hobby horse for Trump’s entire term. This led directly to the lunatic response by the US government and media to the Russian SMO, which continues to this day. Without an understanding of who and what the neocons are, none of this can make any sense.

        I just have one bone to pick with you Z. Before you said that Jews have more money because of their superhuman intelligence. Oh, I think they are intelligent enough, but it’s more like an athlete. To make the most out of your God-given intelligence, you train (study). They train their kids, while whites look down on nerds and want their kids to excel in sportsball, and be homecoming king and queen.I think this proves my point that Jews aren’t endowed with superhuman brains. Plus, and I know it’s not polite to say this in our society, but the average Eastern European thinks they are crooks. This society is blind to that aspect because kumbaya rules and we don’t say things like that in polite society.

            But we do train our children to be nerds – in fact we train them to be Renaissance Men and excel at everything.  We also teach them Truth, Justice and the American Way (TM) which only worked while we were a homogeneous society.  We also are the least nepotistic people.  After the coming genetic bottleneck, only those of us with extreme ingroup preference and a complete mistrust for outgroups will have passed on genes.

                Point taken, and maybe in the upper income areas they are serious about schooling, but I went to a middle class high school. Nerds were out of place in that school.

                    I do see this trend among Whites (and not just Whites by any means) where they will throw six figure sums at their kids with mediocre sporting talent in an attempt to make them sportsball stars, rather than finding out what they are good at (engineering? physics? carpentry?) and investing in that.Also better to have a trade like welding than a useless, expensive degree in Social Africanism &amp; all the commie brainwashing to boot.

            Why are there more male than female roofers? Lumberjacks? Mechanics? Commercial fishers? Why were boards of directors almost exclusively older white males? Self selection explains most of the “disparities” we see. Everywhere.
So is it just remotely possible that whites just do not self-select into careers Jews do? Other than Congress and trailer parks and union top dogs, you just don’t see white guys who aspire to a life of parasitism.

                Then don’t complain about them hoovering up all the money.
I’m agnostic about almost every subject, including the Jews. But I do give them credit when it comes to education. That is the one thing they do very well.
And in their defense, there were plenty of WASP bankster parasites in the old days as well. They just weren’t as brazen as people are today.

                    I’m not complaining. I’ve said before that I think the JQ is overhyped. I don’t know of anything I’ve ever set my mind to that Jews have made more than inconvenient. Sometimes I’ve had to pay a little more? Yeah, white liberals make me do that, too.
I’m Zionist because it is self-evident that until (((they))) all leave, the DR will not lift a finger to save their communities. I’m just one guy. There’s only so much I can do by myself.

        From everything I have learned in this side of the aisle I can add my 2c. I am aware there is nothing new here, but a friendly reminder.The way every public figure (politician, pundit, celebrity) rises is a whole Truman show. The neo cons were part of the theater of controlled opposition and so they got invites to every political show and sinecures through think tanks as payment. This way they could show a “debate” with “both sides”, “fair and balanced”. The whole network of think tanks, revolving doors between private and public sector, doors between political and media, doors between intelligence agencies and everything else is a big matrix.The most Truman showesque show was 2020 with all the lockdown justified resets and summers of love designed to scare the population into accepting Biden. A normie friend that was neutral to Trump was relieved about Biden as he felt how the MSNBC and others hysteric show came to an end. Or at least calmed down for awhile.One mistake they made in 2016 was to allow dissident opinions unchecked and then they proceeded to nuke Facebook news and comments in their most fragile disinformation channels (The Atlantic killed their comments among many others).Then you discover Gloria Steinem, modern art in NYC, the music industry, the entertainment industry are all double agents for intelligence agencies and the way they gatekeep and pick who becomes popular and you wonder if there is any way to become known outside their control. I guess when you become too influential is when you get “the call” and get a Faustian offer for your cooperation. Taylor Swift is a girl boss, most successful entrepreneur, woman of the decade, nothing to see here.TLDR: these Neocons are just paid actors, all fake and ghey.PS. Another phrase we should retire is how GOP always loses. They always win, they achieve their goals, their goal is not to govern but to provide an alibi for the Democrats and a way to save them from their own self inflicted damage. The GOP fake threat to impeach Biden may be a play (among many others) to lose the 24 election (the chess play is to make Biden a “principled” guy who placed Israel in their place, there is a sucker born every minute), anything that indirectly can damage Trump will be attempted (like emphasizing abortion and other culture war issues as distinctly GOP). They can make sure GOP still “win” their elections while Trump loses. Cue the News articles analyzing this new “statistical” mystery. FiveThirtyEight will host a GOP special.

I think it’s a bit misleading (granted, it’s intended to be). Most Jews (at least not the ones that we usually have to deal with) are ethnically Semitic, and the term is rarely if ever used in reference to Arabs.

        Excellent.One of the things social and political exiles ask themselves upon banishment or cancellation is – “where do I go from here?”I was a normiecon griller for years and maybe a bit of a Neocon. Years agoI ran afoul of that conceited faggot – Vox Day for it. In my defense I was a fat old guy, who spent his time in the liberal hive noticing things. It’s one thing to note those things, and quite another to explain and understand them. I got egged by Vox and his comic book kids and cellar dwellers without really ever understanding what a neocon was.From that vantage point, I see ‘neoconnery’ as probably one of the biggest threats to Dissidence as defined by you guys here. It sounded good. Back then Conservative Inc still sounded good in my ears. To argue against it with a Normie you have to sound better. You have to be able to define it, understand it AND present the Dissident rebuttals in a mature, reasoned way. A sound understanding of neocons needs to be part of Dissidence 101.Is it fair to say that Neoconism was what birthed the dissident movement?

Quite fair, and at a minimum it was a major component. Many of the original Paleocons had labored in the shadows earlier but the catastrophic W Regime ramped up enough revulsion to lead to outright dissidence. The same may be happening from the other direction now as the Left realizes who controls the parties it supports.

        What is interesting is that the twilight of the neocons may well coincide with the twilight of Lawfare as a political strategy.  Not coincidentally, both are largely led by the tribe.Things are coming to a head with these Trump sham cases.  Much like the failed neocon mercenary wars, these sham legal maneuvers are unable to withstand much in the way of critical thinking skills.  They both mainly rely on threats, intimidation, and appeals to “democracy”  or “patriotism”.  But repeated failures (Iraq, impeachments, Ukraine, Trump/primaries) shed light on these misadventures.  Sunlight is the enemy of both.Ukraine will fold.  Republicans passed the funding to allow Democrats to blame-shift.  But both camps know the neocons led them both to ruin.Down in Miami, Judge Cannon seems to be running a sort of inverted grand jury proceeding against Jack Smith.  She has so far deftly managed to disclose a lot of facts heretofore concealed from the public.  These facts show just how badly Jack Smith and the FBI have been lying to the public.  Staged photos, anyone?SCOTUS may have to save the government from itself by giving Trump immunity.idk, it just feels like a fever before it breaks.  Sometimes fevers break because the patient is deceased.  Sometimes it’s on the road to recovery.Not sure which, yet, but the way things have turned on the neocons makes me wonder if their Legal Arm isn’t also going to be shown the door.

        We have an absolute ton of “communists” embedded in corporations and particularly in universities in the form of “Chinese-Americans” and Chinese nationals.  But because they are a different race, we’re not allowed to notice.  Not only do “Chinese Americans” have no loyalty to the US, even if they did, they are often faced with threats to their family still in China.Given how inept we are at fighting them, thank god they aren’t that great themselves, at least so far.  If we are ever going to fight the Chinese infiltrators, we will need broad sweeping changes to the culture or at least an exception carved out to be “racist” against Chinese.  China knows well this weak point in our defense and exploits it on a regular basis.

        Today the Economist published an article predicting a collapse of the international order and stating that it’s collapse could be sudden and irreversible. That is no trivial bit of contemporary news. Assuming that there may be some modicum of validity to that admonition, how urgent is a history lesson on the origins of the neocons? In other words, what can you do with a knowledge of neocon history that exceeds a potentially serious warning that could effect everyone in their daily lives at the root level, i.e. high inflation at the very least or nuclear Armageddon if all Hell breaks loose?

                    I think so, too. However, I don’t think it’s a cast iron certainty it’s all going to blow up within 10 years. Hard to imagine the shitshow going on for more than 15, though.

            I read it. Not worth linking. Vague generalities. But noteworthy just for the mainstreaming of the collapse narrative, which is everywhere now.Actual or potential expats have to consider the unknown consequences of a collapse of globalism and global trade, re: potentially leaping out of the frying pan and into the fire. I question if it will be the best place, but I am sure AINO won’t be the absolute worst place to weather such a thing. There are a lot of unknown unknowns. It would suck to find yourself in a foreign land with no tribe when things go sideways.

                I know people who bought into the whole “Belize” fad.  That model only works in an American protectorate.  We will see a flood of re-pats when things get bad.  As long as you’re not in a major US city, if things go sideways, you’ll be reasonably safe.
If the St. George riots didn’t convince people to GTFO of the big cities, I don’t know what will.  That’s where the danger is.

                    I was thinking more in the sense of hyperinflation, but that is not very predictable either. Switching your life savings to the currency of whatever “developing” country you move to is not exactly a foolproof defense. (Nor are precious metals, although I wasn’t looking to stir up a big discussion on that!)

        In re: pathological antipathy towards Russia:After WWII and the US took over the British Empire, the newfound 3 letter murder/overthrow agencies were staffed with former Eastern Europeans and Russians, particularly Jews.  They had a natural dislike for Russians and that has been the culture of the US departments ever since.China?  Well, those were staffed by former missionaries to China who generally were sinophiles but thought the Chinese were hopeless peasants.  That attitude is only now starting to change.It could just be this though:  divide a conquer.  Isreal uses us to keep its enemies in disarray; the neocons may just like war to keep the rest of the world from uniting and throwing us out on our ear as the “indispensable nation.”

        Maybe it will require a re-listen, but I didn’t catch the specifics of the antipathy toward Russia. The Pale of Settlement/rapey Cossack claims are frequently made, but those really manifested only after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II. The Orthodox Church mirrored the Catholic Church pre-Vatican II in its view of Jews, who seem to have been afforded similar treatment as the Muslims during the Imperial millennia. Is the rage because of the elimination of Trotsky combined with earlier mistreatment, real or perceived?Schiff and other Wall Street titans funded the October Revolution, which would have preceded Trotsky’s pointed demise, and that seems to indicate a nascent type of neo-conservatism as far back as then.If anyone knows, it would be interesting to read.

            Bagels have been at daggers drawn with Russians (and Slavs more generally) for far longer than Western Europeans. Primarily because the Russians never allowed their Bagels access to power, as Western and even Islamic medieval and Renaissance courts did, nor were they granted rights as citizens like their Western coreligionists were in the 19th century West. They remained, for far longer in the East, a segregated, powerless, and despised group, and they nursed those hatreds for centuries, until allowed to express them in America, with the encouragement of (mostly Protestant) Europeans and Americans who had their own virulent dislikes of Russians and Slavs as stupid, barbaric peasants. Specifically American dislike of Russia is evident as early as the 1890s, decades before Pale of Settlement Bagels wormed their way into political power.

                I’ve never understood the virulent anti-Russian hate (I am not a slav or Russian).  When I was young, I just wrote it off as anti-communist rhetoric. But it never really went away.  It’s like the anti-Putin hate. It’s just another thing I don’t get, though that one can be partially explained by his putting an end to the looting of Russia post soviet.

Here’s proof. Theuntermenschenpictured are not the hook nosed Bagels, but Slavs.

                    The Russia hate is quite real and I don’t understand it, either. It made sense when the USSR was the avatar of International Communism, but it was a thing both before and afterwards. It was more than just mere empire jockeying, too, especially for the British who regarded the Russians as near-subhuman.

                We’ve had Bagels here since day 1, mostly of Western European origin. 1890 is the wave of the Eastern European bagels who probably had a centuries old grudge matches with Russia.
It was not an American dislike, but an immigrant dislike. The heritage Americans I know could still barely find Russia on map.

Sober men don’t believe in America and so can’t faithfully swear an oath to uphold the big Con or the little cons of the “States”.It’s btw that an extremist named Boyd Cathey just published his own summary of the Neocons’ history and explained their way asa secularized globalist vision. He omits important details, presumably because he cannot bear to admit that he and his fathers have been zombies of Zion’s patriarchy for a dozen centuries or longer.

I looked him up at the SPLC’s site this morning. There’sa demonology, of course, and I’ve assumed it’s the same guy. “According to an SSPX newsletter, Cathey was ordained in 1979 and went on to teach at the society’s seminary in Ridgefield, Conn.” Two authors, named Wilson and Squire,think that they have the Z man, too, all figured out.

I’ve posted this before, and recently, but it just seems so veryapropos:
They have given us into the hand of new unhappy lords,Lords without anger or honour, who dare not carry their swords.They fight by shuffling papers; they have bright dead alien eyes;They look at our labour and laughter as a tired man looks at flies.

Must be quite the exalted lineage. I can’t imagine there are very many among us these days who can trace their fathers back over “a dozen centuries or longer”…

        The comment about red diaper babies reminded me of one named David Horowitz, a radical Jew who collaborated with the Black Panthers and other radical factions during the 60’s and early 70’s. He turned “conservative” by the mid to late 80’s and in the 90’s wrote a fascinating book,Radical Son, which delves into his own background and roots prior to the 60’s as well as his trajectory though the New Left and into his later politics. For 36 years he’s run something now called the David Horowitz Freedom Center, though he’s really just another Jewish supremacist. The SPLC calls it a hate group.One of his allies (or footsoldiers) is Robert Spencer ofJihad Watch. Spencer has written and spoken for more than twenty years about the menace of Islam, aka “the broom of Israel”, and about Muhammadist immigration. Poor guy changed his mind about the RCC and converted to Orthodoxy, but he just can’t bear the stress of pointing out Jacob’s grubby fingerprints all over the immivasion and some other contemporary political problems, too.Spencer, in fact, is somewhat correct about Islam, but he needs to be enticed or pushed over a hill he’s afraid to climb. No, not just the race realism hill but the Abrahamism realism hill, too. Without this he won’t steer events, as he might, sharply toward a global strategy of demoralizing all Islamists and driving reproduction rates of Islamists toward zero children per lifetime, esp. among Arabs and other aliens in our lands.

        I was just thinking about something. Trump has the comedic timing of a Borscht Belt comedian. A long time ago, an idea occurred to me. I wondered if all the Jew hate for Trump had to do with the fact that he reminds them too much of … Eastern European/low class Jews? I think you hit on some things in your podcast that makes me think I was on the right track with this.

        I think that when push came to shove, the older, German Neocons would side with the POS (Lol! not that, Pale of Settlement) Neocons.How else would these untalented people get so much backing?
The Russians have always owned the POS Neocons, and this is something that eats at them like a cancer.However, the Nuland types are psychotic, and will burn the whole world down with them instead of admitting they were wrong or are inferior to Russians.

            The revised Holocaust—in its latest revision, mostly the fault of “the Allies” (Britain and America) who let it happen because Whiteness—is the founding myth of a unified diaspora. It made Jewishness aclassencompassing all European-descended Jews who aren’t losers. Deplorableweird-hatRepublican/Likudmerchants are de facto excluded, but not in principle, and not in the breach. The German-American vs. Other-American Jewish war is forgotten. I only learned out about it by not understanding old jokes.
