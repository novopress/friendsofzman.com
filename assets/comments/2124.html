        Fake Indian will be a relief after Obama. Warren has a quintessential American upbringing. She will be a terrible president, but she at least will be a normal American-type person screwing up in the job.

        I agree, Fake Indian will be the one.  The Republicans likely will stumble into control of Congress this year, where they will spin their wheels for a couple of years, accomplishing nothing, since the Democrats will uphold B.O.’s vetoes without question.
Then Fake Indian will be well set up to run as a ‘populist’ attacking the Do-Nothing Obstructionist Congress.  The Republican presidential candidate will treat her with kid gloves, since he will be terrified of the ‘sexist’ tag.
The Diversity, single woman and metrosexuals will come through again, and the deal is done.
