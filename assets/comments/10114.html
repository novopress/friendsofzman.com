        Moore has a double digit lead over Strangelove, and it increased after last night’s Bannon appearance. The GOP establishment is terror stricken. Trump has discovered their Achilles heel.

            There is zero plausible deniability remaining for the cucks.  It’s similar to the Dems IV drip of claims of concern for the brown poor. With 50 years of Great Society decay data ignored, it can be concluded they don’t care about these people’s well-being.Back to the cucks. The gig is up and you can see it on their faces. Ryan looked like Terry Anderson’s 1980’s hostage videos during his recent town hall. (((Jake Tapper))) crafted the first 15min as a Marxist struggle session with a parade of jews wagging their fingers at him regarding Charlottesville and their mortal terror, then judging if Ryan was sufficiently apologetic for the actions of others.  They also demanded “hate crime” legislation.  Imagine Ryan trying to sell that to Trump’s base whom he must know despise him. Ryan should have been born 20 years earlier.  Like SSI with anyone younger than Boomers, he will outlive the Ponzi scheme…. left to hide behind the one wall he did approve which surrounds his house….a target on his back…out of excuses and audiences for pretty lies.

            Strange would stand a much better chance if McConnell hadn’t endorsed him.  People down here noticed that.  As I posted elsewhere, I’d vote for a dead syphilitic dog just to poke McConnell in the eye.  And since there’s no dead syphilitic dog on the ballot, Moore will have to do.

            From Yahoo News tonight:Incumbent Sen. Luther Strange wished jurist Roy Moore well after losing the Alabama Republican primary for Senate.  Strange told his supporters Tuesday night that “we wish (Moore) well going forward.”But he quickly shifted to his own bewilderment at the race he just finished. “We’re dealing with a political environment that I’ve never had any experience with,” he said.  “I’m telling you, the political seas and winds in this country right now … are very hard to navigate, very hard to understand.”It’s only hard to understand if you don’t speak English.  “We hate you people, and we want all of you gone.”  Maybe if we yell louder??

        That’s the funniest part of this “literally Hitler” business — of the many lessons we should’ve learned from that mustached fellow, a very big one for Establishment politicians is: The clown you think you’re using is actually using you, much better and far more ruthlessly.

        I believe Trumps’s mixed signals on various issues (DACA, Strange) are tactical. His NFL gambit is a clear message to the Dirt People that he’s still on their side.

            Trump creates chaos. He thrives on it as he is quick on his feet and shameless about it. Name another politician who would be so brazen about what he is doing in Alabama. What no one has bothered to notice on the DACA thing is they are now deporting these people. Unless Congress acts, the program ends, the illegals are deported and Trump will say, “If you don’t like it, call your Congressman.”

It’s a very tough call for any churchgoer who believes and supports with what their local congregation teaches and does, but has gas pains from the political meddling of their national organization / heirarchy.

                    Alcogito, I say tell them you’re going to withhold contributions until they stop destroying their own country and the lives of their fellow countrymen by flooding us with immigrants, even if it makes the church good money:

                    Find a church with the Traditional Latin Mass.  You’ll hear homilies about the evils of Modernism and how Islam, properly understood, is a heresy of Catholicism.  The Traditional Latin Mass is the Dissident Right Movement of the Catholic Church.

                David;Agree.  The NFL fracas features similar methodology on Trump’s part.  Apparently the NFL was hiding in the weeds, hoping to ride out the planned media s**t-storm over concussions killing black yuts, etc.: Another re-run of ‘Black Lives Matter’ for anti-Trump political use.The NFL was apparently planning to play ball with the Cloud Folk by appearing to side with their employees while maintaining elite solidarity.  But Trump flushed the NFL from cover amid great squawking. The only question now is how many shotgun pellets they get in the backside from their customers.  As Instapundit says, ‘This is a battle that the NFL can’t win and Trump can’t lose.’

                    the nfl was dying before this fracas.  now they are dying much faster.   what’s funny about the CTE affected negroes (who oddly enough are more intelligent than non-CTE negroes) is they think they are showing unity against Trump, while their dwindling audience of whites see them as united against America.  next season they will be handing out tickets in Cracker Jacks boxes…

                Once you view the NFL as largely populated by thugs posturing for the cameras, it is so easy to walk away and never look back.
If I were in sports, I would be building a rugby or Australian rules football semi-pro league TODAY.  White middle class guys want and need roughly played team sports, enjoyed over beers.  Soccer and baseball don’t scratch that itch.  Hockey does only to a point.

                    A thousand years ago they wore their hair long, dressed in leather, rode horses, played violent ball on long fields of grass, and drank mead.
Today we have bikers on iron horses, teams playing football and rugby, and men still drinking de beers.

From Taki’s:“What makes people believe a more ‘diverse’ United States is going to be more free or egalitarian?”
http://takimag.com/article/looking_southward_costin_alamariu/print#ixzz4tpIudkmg
“Looking Southward” discusses the racial ‘casta’ system, as diverse as any castes in India.
I think one would have to play 5D chess with a diverse, caste-based parliamentary system.  Imagine the stasis; would the corruption of “interests” cancel each other out, as ours meant to do?  Perhaps that’s why Latin America is too busy for foreign wars.

        I don’t think most folks nationally understand how the Confederate statue destruction movement is playing in the deep South. This travesty opened a visceral wound that will not heal quickly or easily. The Alabama senate primary will be the first manifestation of how deeply and passionately they react to the carpetbagger methods of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan.

        Trump is just a stepping stone and a passing political landmark.The dissident right as you call it – is growing. They’ve done the soap box, they’ve done the ballot box, and this is pretty much the last chance for everyone to wise up and play ball.From here on out I think it will be cartridge boxes and candidates that make Trump look like a saint. The left has no answers, they’ve bankrupted their constituencies and all they have to offer Americans is to bankrupt the other half of the nation that still works and pays the bills.Life is going to become a lot tougher for everyone – especially stupid people.

                    Al from da NortWill;I agree that the USA will default on our national debt at some point because it is simply impossible to pay it, particularly politically, as you point out. But the important question is how it’s done and what happens afterwards.It may be that there is a scheme in the works right now using just the sort for of legal sophistry that Z Man describes above. The generic name of that scheme is ‘odious debt’.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odious_debtNow, the historical precedent is that there is some sort of coup or revolution and the new regime repudiates the debts of its predecessor. Those inside without connections to the new regime are ‘SOL’ as we used to say (s**t out of luck). Those outside without a powerful and ruthless patron to force payment have to figure out how far they are willing to go to collect. Usually negotiation ensues.The doctrine of ‘odious debt’ was conveniently concocted by a Russian emigre shyster in Paris in 1927 to provide a rationale to the war-weary Western Powers why they shouldn’t try to collect the debts incurred by Russia under the Czars from the USSR.* It is beloved in NGO world to this day. Briefly, it holds that it is *morally wrong* to try to collect any debt that was created against ‘the will of the people’ and against their interest, by unjust rulers, etc.Ordinarily, this doctrine is attempted by NGO’s against the foreign creditors of their particular favorite third-world pesthole (e.g. Haiti). But could the Cloud be so mad as to try to apply it against domestic creditors, like us_? To ask is to answer, I’d say. They have to know that the debt cannot be paid. Suppose their plan to pay it is to make the US majority-minority and then apply this doctrine. The NYT editorial writes itself already: “Because of the long history of racism and exploitation, blah, blah, blah, it would be unjust to hold the shiny city of new America responsible for the debts incurred by the evil, bad racist old America…”All of a sudden the Cloud’s apparent insanity about immigration and constant race-baiting identity politics make a lot more sense… That it is an evil, stupid plan on many levels, with many ways to go badly wrong, doesn’t mean that it is not their plan_! And they *do* hate us.*People didn’t just escape from the USSR in the mid 1920’s and Stalin’s assassins roamed Paris (where the shyster lived) nearly at will, killing regime enemies who put their heads up, as well as those Russian emigres who just pissed him off. Yet this high-profile fellow thrived. At that time, the Western Powers were militarily capable of collecting the Russian debts using their tried and true methods of gunboat diplomacy. ‘This was no coincidence, comrade.’, as the commies are found of saying to this very day.

                        i am kind of curious where it all went.  not out into the general economy (in the form of wage increases).   a lot looks to have been loaned to companies for buying back their own stock.  anyone have any ideas about where the bulk of obama’s trillions went?

                            Karl;Reasoning by analogy: Obama. Jerrett, Emanuel, et al, are Chicago machine pols.  The Chicago machine sluices tax money through various departments, commissions and foundations, all to support the Prog lifestyle.  That is, make-work and no-show jobs for those connected to the insiders, who will  be called upon to work for the machine’s powers and existence on any and all occasions.  More importantly, there are grants and contracts for the connected (which pay the top Progs way more than a simple no-show job).  Public benefit is actually incidental but the sham must be maintained for the low information set so that they don’t ask why they are not benefitting.So, in the absence of more specific information, it is a safe bet that much of the new money went to support the Prog lifestyle.  Just look at the grants the big alphabet agencies push through the big U’s and the vast array of NGO’s for specific examples.

                There’s still lots of food around, Z.
What happens when your kids can’t eat because income is taxed away? What happens when mortgages start foreclosing and repo men are working 24/7/365? What happens when you eat at soup kitchens or not at all – and the blacks are freaking out because their EBT cards and Obama phones don’t work anymore? It is going to be mutiny on the Bounty when the rest of these liberal problems come home to roost.

                I’m not certain about that. The level of anger is palpable these days and it takes only one minor event to set of a chain of nastinessGod knows we’ve been buying all  those millions of  weapons for some reason.Even so if we did have \a  cartridge box phase to what end?Everybody you hate is now gone, now what?hell if they all died in a magic comet pass-by  you’d still have the same problemsNo one on any side  has a even a basic   idea as to how a new society could be configured what it should do and assumptions about economics , social structures and the like differ so much in with in factions , no one is going to take orders from anyone else since they don’t want they same thingsI suppose  the .Alt Right has a kind of document of principles now, the 16 points kind of but that’s not enough to accomplish anything but that’s about it that is new on horizonHell  when the Northwest Front a bunch of Nazi/W.N.  clucks has a better workable plan than anyone else we all  have a problemNot to put too fine a point on it until recently (Mid 90’s) the Cathedral as the NrX guys like to call it did a very good job of governing and even with keeping up with technology . They deserved power because they used it well mostly to the good of people in the WestRight now though everyone including them  is  stuck on stupid, The Nazis  think its 1938 the Reds still think its  1918,the Democrats 1968, The Actual Republicans 1998 and the .Alt Right thinks we can go back to 1428! The cathedral is just running madPretty much none of them are fit to lead a cub scout troop  and that includes the Christendom part of the  .Alt Right . They are good guys but no one is going to let them run anything. Fewer people want that they are selling or believe it than they need to run a societyNor doe a single  faction has the slightest comprehension of technology, the efficiency trap  or the fact the world has changed drastically since 1995 .Understanding the concept of technological convergence and its effects on culture and stability is so far beyond most of  the elected and appointed they might as well be retarded 3rd graders trying to build a supercomputerSeriously as a society  we haven’t really adapted to social effects of the pill which has been around for 50 years or more or regular abortion for 40 and urbanization and the logical family size declineThe faction that can come up with a good workable plan ,to make more homogeneous, fix the family, have stable remunerative work and cut the despair index without being subverted or being a tyrant  or being controlled  by multinational corporations can win everything but thus far no one has any way to do thisFrankly none of the  other factions are worth lifting a finger for even the .Alt Right who is the best of all them

                I agree with this. with one caveat-if the economy goes to complete shit and those same fat lazy people begin to suffer and really feel the pinch, all while the 24/7 “hate whitey” drumbeats are beating from the left, I think the possibility odds change somewhat.

        It is easy to become impatient with the President and worry  that he’s given up or never really intended to drain the swamp.  I do it frequently.This post and the comments reinforce how wedged-in Trump actually is … multiple rocks and hard places.I don’t know that I believe 5-d chess is going on, exactly.  But it’s pretty clear that significant action requires prelimiary changes and those changes, in turn, require their own prerequisite changes.  I think the man is playing the long game about as well as anyone could.When I get impatient, I remind myself that without Trump, Ms. Clinton would be president now.  Scary thought.  If she were in office, it wouldn’t have surprised me to see an executive order making sites like this illegal.

            Yes, given that the most proximate backstabbers to Trump are in his own party, he has to play the long game. I often look around and think that elections change nothing, but then think “Neil Gorsuch” and realize half a loaf is better than none.

            “it wouldn’t have surprised me to see an executive order making sites like this illegal.”  More likely it would have been an IRS audit, a visit from whatever government agency they could best harass him with, and an NSA scan through his phone and e-mail records for any dirt they could throw at him.

        “His opposition is not the Democrats. His enemy is the GOP, that has traditionally served to blunt the interests of the White Party.”Never forget: the Republicans didn’t defeat the Dems last November; Trump did. He won because he’s Trump, not because he’s “Republican.”  The GOPe deserves zero credit for his victory, the GOPe being merely the trailing edge of the Democrat wing. As Michael Walsh has observed repeatedly, there are not two parties but one Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party. Put another way, last year’s election was Cloud People vs. Dirt People. Had the cucks nominated ¡Jeb! or Micro Rubio, the race would have been Cloud People vs. Cloud People. There’s a reason traitors are detested more than sworn enemies. This is why Republican Party delenda est.

        Having been a single issue—Second Amendment—voter for the last few decades, I got from Trump what I wanted: Gorsuch. Anything else is icing on the cake.
Another thing Trump might be doing that seems counter-intuitive presently is letting anti-Trumper Mueller do all the heavy shovel work on digging a hole to punish, or at least expose and shame, Hussein’s spying efforts.

            The more Mueller scrambles, and the less he delivers, the greater the Trump victory over the rest of the Washington swamp.  A high-risk gambit by Trump, but it just might pay off for him in a big way.

        Trump gave Strange the most backhanded endorsement you can give somebody.  He basically said, “Well, if he manages to win, we’ll get credit for that.  But if he loses, I’m going to campaign like hell for the other guy.”If Moore wins, expect additional primary challengers in red/Trump states against the Flakes currently holding those seats.  In fact, you might look at this primary as a bell weather of the Flake primary next year, and he will not get a backhanded Trump endorsement.  Trump has already tweeted out support for one of the opponents (Ward), and has people helping her.  When you can’t poll over 20% as an incumbent, and somebody nobody ever heard of is in the 40%’s…you’re in big trouble.  McCain survived re-election with terrible poll numbers, but that has more to do with lack of a real primary challenge (Trump is not McConnell, and McCain and Trump hate each other hard), and that AZ is still a very red state…the Democrat was never going to win.I hope Flake loses by triple digits, lol.McConnell should be relieved he won re-election in 2016 because if he was up next year, Trump would primary him as well.

            I’m not entirely sure McConnell and Ryan are fully in touch with reality. Ryan talks like a man who was transported from 1994 to the present, but it unaware of that fact. My hunch with Ryan is he knows he has sold out to the donors. He’s no longer his own man so he just runs around saying banal things and waiting until the trap door under his feet opens.

                Ryan calculated the immense powers working against Trump from every direction and expected to ride him out and stick a fork in him. Lots of people were betting real money that Trump wouldn’t finish his term. So Ryan has no plan B, yet. My question is, will Trump let him off the floor when he does? Either way, Hail Trump.

                Ryan is definitely still playing the old Conservative Inc. game.  I get his Facebook updates still (The Weekly Standard blocks me now), and just love his posts about immigration reform, tax reform, repealing Obamacare, etc…and it’s like this alt-reality where nobody knows how badly he and McConnell have failed.Have to say I am increasingly thrilled that my term for it back from our NRO days – Conservative Inc. – has stuck and made it into the mainstream.  I’m not so arrogant as to assume I’m the only person to ever think of something, but I’ve been calling them Conservative Inc. for 6-7 years now pretty much everywhere I comment on things.  I’m pretty sure I coined it.These primary challenges are going to be interesting because even with Strange it’s pretty clear that Trump is trying to kick the legs out from under the stool.  If he gets a few of his people elected, watch for McCain, Collins, and other Democrats in the GOP to just make it official and switch parties like Arlen Specter did.

            My impression is the All-Hands-On-Deck alert called by the donor/ruling class during the election season to drag Hillary across the finish line was never cancelled. The donors/ruling class are still exerting immense pressure to bring Trump’s Administration to a premature end, which explains why you see the Leftist Congresscritters acting and talking absolutely crazy nonsense and the Right not supporting the MAGA agenda or our President even though voters gave the GOP the White House and Congress to get it done. So the Congressmen have even less agency than usual due to this pressure. Whores.

        I think Trump weakly backed the establishment Luther in Alabama because if he actively turns on the GOP establishment then the GOP establishment would happily work with Democrats to impeach him and get him out of office and replaced with the  more establishment Pence (which with the Democrats help they would have the numbers to do). Trump has to essentially subvert or cuckold the GOP establishment while they aren’t looking.

        Somewhat related: more rocks and hard places revealed:“Most pollsters and pundits report that President Trump’s approval ratings are in the tank…   In every poll, Democrat respondents outnumbered Republicans by significant amounts. The Economist poll was the worst. Only 24 percent of respondents (360) were Republicans compared to 38 percent (570) Democrats – which means that 58 percent more Democrats were polled than Republicans …”https://www.bombthrowers.com/article/mainstream-political-polls-commit-fraud/Actually, TheConservativeTreehouse.com reported this phenomenon often and in detail during the Presidential campaign.The good news is that increasing numbers of people are distruting the institutions that have been feeding them shit — in this case the pollsters.  Ther’re doing this even without the analysis that shows the details of the fraud.  Seeing the cooked books in black and white just speeds things up.

        Z Man;Excellent analysis.  However, I’d posit that the MSM is *still* the enemy center of gravity*, even after the election, and not entirely the GOPe per se.  It is as much for fear of the media as it is love for their big donors that the GOPe is stalling his agenda (that they ran and won on).  In addition to providing favorable election coverage, the media can, to some extent, direct large donations from those who care about ‘hangin with the Kardashians’ in elite circles.  They do this, of course, by hyping up one Repub. (looking at you McCain &amp; Collins) while trashing another, selectively, hence strategically.Trumps genius is to be able to disrupt the MSM by being inside their scandal/outrage cycle as much as possible.  This cycle takes about a week to gin up, so an ‘outrageous’ tweet every two or three days has them like cats chasing the laser spot but never catching it.His problem with the fearful, office-loving GOPe is that he has not yet convinced them that he has neutralized the MSM, if indeed he has.  They’re likely thinking that disruption is not the same thing as killing the MSM’s power and influence.  So they’re better off keeping still under cover to see if the dragon is dead instead of merely dazed temporarily, so to speak.His plan now, as you say, appears to be to convince the GOPe that they have just as much to fear from him and his base as they do from the unhinged media that hates them anyway.*The enemy center of gravity is that position, once taken, which collapses the entire enemy line of resistance.  The MSM was clearly Hillary’s center of gravity and they were almost powerful enough to drag her decrepit carcass over the finish line despite Pres. Trump’s disrupting them.

        Zman, I guess you are just having fun with this, but it comes across wrong…. you do the “white party” folks in Alabama a disservice pondering that Trump might lose them if Strange wins.  Kinda insulting.  As if they aren’t aware… as if there is another national candidate, much less office holder, that has so solidly trashed the  status quo and spoken in the olden tongues of nationalism and American is  great, etc.Those Moore supporters are really going to feel so betrayed, they’d stay at home and not vote for any other politician b/c of Moore losing?  There is no one else to vote for.  No way they would protest and vote for a Democrat. They will be disappointed but Trump has made it clear, he has a agenda and Strange stepped up so Trump stepped up.  It’s clear Trump is making an effort to stand by someone.. to show others.And the 5-layer chess crack was insulting.  I don’t know who you are referring to.. but where I’ve read it, it is not literal, but trolling the crap out of RINO’s , NRO folks and Bernie bots.  But whatever.   Trump took very little risk with this gambit.  win/win/win…

        I have difficulty understanding why Paul Ryan is still Speaker of the House. I mean, I don’t really have difficulty understanding it. I know it is because he gives exquisite blowjobs to his masters. But, there are essentially 3 parties in the Federal government now. The DemonicRat party, the RINO’s, and the pro-Trump contingent. And Trump’s is the smallest of the 3.Trump is theoretically the acting head of the Republican Party by virtue of being elected President as a Republican. But, he has almost no control over his party. The longer the Swamp stymies his efforts, the more his base will become disillusioned. I know that the Speaker can be changed at any time if someone proposes it on the floor and then the current Speaker doesn’t get a majority. I don’t think there is anyone in the House that wants to commit career suicide by doing this. So, the next option is malfeasance on the part of Ryan. Won’t happen. At least he won’t get caught. So, the remaining option are the DemonicRats regain control of the House in 2018 or Ryan isn’t reelected in 2018. And that is over a year away. Trump could get the public on his side and the RINO’s would be forced to work with him, but the Swamp, the media, and over 40% of the American electorate are his enemy. A war with North Korea might work, since everyone becomes a patriot when war begins. No, Trump’s policies will be opposed by Ryan for the next year.Can Ryan be beaten in 2018? I don’t know. Wisconsin is a mixed bag of SJW’s and conservatives. Can this country wait a year? The economic collapse is just around the corner, but its been around the corner for decades now. And an economic collapse can hurt Trump since most Americans blame the President rather than actually understand the process involved. Is Trump enough of a strategist to get the people of Wisconsin to reject Ryan or is he doomed to an alliance with those who would rather see him castrated?

            Trump owns the republican base — all of it.   As Zman said, ryan and turtle have been conning the other house and senate members about that fact.   Once the scalp count from the midterms comes in, those two turds are finally flushed.   no lobbying $$ for them either (i bet).

                Democrat donor dollars have dried up.  Can’t wait to see the GOPe donation glide path go the same way.
Dems wanted political donations blocked (in a “wink-wink, nudge-nudge” sort of way).  Trump is delivering on that.

Do you really think there is any conning involved? You have to make sure your minions know what you want them to know, plus at least enough information to know what boundaries have been set down.

                    there is mutual conning going on, but i would say the vast majority of elected gop officials are gope and need to be primarried ASAP.  only need to claima few scalps to get the rest in line.  keeping the traitors from cashing in as lobbyists is what’s really critical to draining the swamp.

        Always go for the simple.  If you’ve watched Trump around New York, he thrives on chaos, since his OODA loop is tighter than most.  Don’t think much different now.  As I believe Z pointed out, most of the Washington press corps (and most Democrats now) are like kittens with laser pointers stapled to their foreheads—give them anything distracting and they are after it. So he give them distraction and Trump can do it faster because he is untroubled by the normal political calculus that McConnell and the Fossils go through.  The NFL is a double bonus since the base loves it and Democrats so far are spending 90% of their bandwidth on a few tweets and a press conference.

        It’s not that we think Trump is playing 5D chess… it’s that he’s playing Chess and most of the public, Media, and Politicos are still playing checkers.He makes mistakes, and failed gambits, But he is a master at grasping opportunity and always has been… as long as the game keeps moving, he can find a way to win. His enemy is stagnation, and so he occasionally has to shake the board to keep it going.

            I’ve posted this before, and will again. Tocqueville–The mental habits which suit action do not always promote thought. The world is not directed by longand learned proofs. All its affairs are decided by the swift glance at a particular fact, the daily examination of the changing moods of the crowd, occasional moments of chance, and the skill to exploit them.

        Maybe it’s me, but does it seem logical that Bannon would be booted out of the White House, only to show up in Alabama to help Roy Moore win down there?  That seems pretty logical to me.  Play the establishment game in D.C. to get them off your back a little bit, but send your people down to AL to help the opposition win.
