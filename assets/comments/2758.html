        Joseph K – I never said Cruz was a libertarian. I meant that the libertarian/Tea Party/Ron Paul supporters worked like hell for his senatorial election.
And as far as I know, Cruz has honored every statement he made in his campaign. Is it wrong to want the job of president? I sorta think anyone who gets elected MUST want it. And want it bad[ly].

        We ran a Hamiltonian in 2012, Mitt Romney, wasn’t good enough.  We ran Teddy Roosevelt in 2008, wasn’t good enough.  The social conservatives got their man in 2000 and 2004 and he wrecked the country.  Conservatives keep talking about betrayal, and then canonize Michele Bachmann.  Conservatives thought Newt Gingrich could be President because he insulted a pundit.  It’s not Conservative Inc. that made a guy in a sweater vest into its last great hope, it was the True Believers.  Reagan may not have been conservative, but he was conservative enough.  So was Mitt Romney.  In many ways Romney was more conservative than NASA Newt and Mr. Contraception, but it wasn’t good enough, so we got Barack Obama.Of course, with Ted Cruz, things will be different.

        To blame Republicans for their condition of spinelessness and stupidity makes no sense. Once, ok, but after the first twenty or so betrayals we might want to get a handle on the problem.  Under the grip of universal suffrage there is no place in politics for a conservative party. Reagan was no conservative. As he pointed out, he didn’t leave the Democrat Party; it left him. The only Founder who would have a place around electoral politics today would be Hamilton.

        I’m sorry, but Ted Cruz is about as libertarian, or Libertarian, as Bob Barr, another ambitious faker whom no one pays attention to any longer.  Of course, no one ever paid any attention to Bob Barr, so Cruz does have a leg up there.  Ron Paul, on the other hand, is a genuine Old Right Libertarian, in the great tradition of Robert Taft and Howard Buffett, and is deserving of the utmost respect, even if one does not agree with his position.  Paul is a man of principle; Cruz is an ambitious cult leader, a pasty, epicene loudmouth with a secret drawer full of checkered ties.   No wonder he and Glenn Beck are having a bromance.Cruz wants the Presidency, and he wants it bad; he’s not just looking to increase his speaking fees and line his pockets, like Gingrich.  And you don’t get to be President without making a deal with Conservative Inc.  Period.  Of course, Cruz being Cruz, he won’t die the death of a thousand self-inflicted cuts, as Rand Paul is now doing.  No, he’ll go down in one apocalyptic flame-out.Here is Bela Lugosi speaking for Tru-Cons and their invention of Ted Cruz:http://youtu.be/OFAUq9cqC9k

        “…Libertarian weirdos have wandered into the fight…”
I can’t speak for anywhere else, but here in Brazoria County, Ron Paul’s home base, the Libertarians and libertarians saw an opportunity to take over the republican party. They have made significant inroads, notably Ted Cruz (who I seriously doubt will make a deal with anyone, much less Conservative, Inc.), though the push to replace Perry in his last campaign for gov, and Ol’ Cornie in this last senate race failed.
I don’t see them giving up – I know some of these guys, and they have the Alamo mindset. They’ll keep trying.

        The problem with the “Dries” is their candidates.  They are inept and embarrassing.  Mitt Romney looked like Churchill compared to the droolers and mouth breathers in the 2012 GOP primary.2016 is looking worse.  Huckabee keeps winning Iowa polls.  Every couple of months some Tea Party columnist touts Bobby Jindal as the second coming of Russell Kirk.  Some snake-handler just suggested Ben Carson for VP.  Rick Santorum has already pulled his sweater vest out of mothballs.  Rick Perry is taking fashion tips from Glenn Beck.  Sarah Palin is still out there tweeting talking points written by Heritage interns.  And then there is Ted Cruz.Tru-Cons can occasionally take down a major figure, but they cannot get one of their Z-leaguers elected when Conservative Inc. is paying attention.  Ted Cruz could have a nice career as a cult leader in the Senate, but he wants to be President.  That means he has to make a deal with Conservative Inc.  Given the trouble he’s caused them, that will mean a couple of pounds of flesh, close to the heart.I keep telling Cruz Cultists that he’s going to be the new Rubio, Conservative Inc.’s point-man on the Great Immigration Betrayal.  They don’t believe me, but then they didn’t believe it when they were warned about Rubio, Ryan, Cantor, and the rest of their former heroes.  Given the turmoil in the Democrat ranks, and the GOP’s almost genetic dysfunction, 2016 is shaping up to be quite a spectacle.  Pass the popcorn!
