        It’s not just that they lie. It’s that lying is an instinct and getting away with the lie is something that they’re proud of. In Middle East cultures – which drives you know who – ripping off someone at the local bazaar is perfectly acceptable.If I trick you, that’s your fault, not mine. My job is to trick you, and your job is to trick me.These people will never quit – ever. Scheming is like breathing to them. The couldn’t stop even if they wanted to. But it’s not to the vast, vast majority of NE Europeans, which is why we’re incompatible.Either we separate, or we lose. We can never keep up their scheming. If we stop one scheme, they’ll just come up with another and another and another. The rest of the world is beginning to understand this, which is why they’re trying to break away. We have to do the same thing. It’s separate or live as trusting peasants who continuously get ripped off by the scheming class.

                Agree. They won’t let go. They can’t let go. They can’t build and sustain a society on their own – and they know it. It’s why they’re always so conflicted.
On the one hand, they run circles around the gullible Goys with their schemes. On the other hand, the need us to have a society. It’s why they look at us as somewhat as farm animals or simple slave hands.

                    The factions are far more likely to go at each other in an administrative civil war than a peaceful separation to happen. Putin’s warning about arming nations hostile to the United States, for example, was telling the US military to put State/YouKnowWho back into line. It seems pretty obvious that the Russians sailing into Havana have an interesting cargo, to say the least. Let’s wait to see if there are “clarifications” about the Genius Plan to give F-16’s to use in a war that has been lost for two years. I bet they are coming soon. The MIC pulls in the bucks over empty threats rather than actualities and wants to keep that grift going.

                        I agree that Putin’s warning probably caused a fair number of phone calls from the Pentagon to the State Dept and Biden’s Kosher Cabinet. These guys don’t stop scheming until someone pushes back physically.
And, then, of course, they pull a Jon Stewart and say, “What? We were only kidding.”

                In a similar vein, my favorite UK comic site once quipped: Technically the individual can be divided, but it isn’t pretty. Or to restate the thought for your Bible-Thumpers out there: What does King Solomon do when neither mother will renounce claim to the babe?

            From what I’m told, China operates the same way.  They have a Chinese saying that goes something like, if you can get away with it, cheat.Presumably, much of the world outside of the Occident operates in this way.“America” pulled the same BS in WW2.  The rules for neutral nations were simple and easy to understand, at least when it came to arms.  The belligerent nation had to take their ships to the neutral nation, pay in gold and then carry away the arms in a ship owned and flagged by the belligerent nation.  FDR tried playing word games to both maintain neutrality and supply arms, fuel, food and other supplies to the Allied side.

                Yeah, the rest of the world, including the biggies of Russia, Iran, India and China operate with a similar mentality. I’ve long suspected that Jews have done so well in the West since the 19th century not because they are so impressive but because they were going up against no competition.The European nobility used to keep the Jews in check, but with the industrial revolution, the Enlightenment and the creep of democracy, the nobility lost their power. Jews were unchained and unleashed on a gullible population with no defense to them.But with the rise of non-whites – both here and abroad – Jews are coming up against people who know how to deal with schemers, and Jews aren’t faring well. The Chinese are running rings around them. The Russians are teaching them that artillery trumps narrative. The Indians are out scheming them.

                Yep. I understand that the term “sandbagging” came from their practice of sprinkling sand into bags of tea because they were paid by weight.

                    Makes sense. Credit where due: at least sand is relatively non-toxic unlike for example when some brilliant guy decides to make the wine go a little bit further by diluting it with wood alcohol.

            There’s a quote I can’t find from an ancient Persian commentator who said that the Greeks were not a noble people because they traded with one another in the market and the goal was to cheat the other guy.So this practice does seem to be a feature of a commercial culture. The ancient Yankees lol were surely in the same league as the ancient Greeks. This was one of the features of the cultural divide between North and South leading up to the War of Northern Aggression. Southerners noted it, whether their planter class were blame-free is an open question.Probably it contributes to the escalation of lies when ideas are considered as competing within a market in the “market-place of ideas” when after all that market is clearly rigged. Sometimes modern America is compared to a shopping mall but it’s probably more accurate to say it’s a middle eastern bazaar.

            That’s why I take issue with our host when he once said that “you know who” is smarter than the average white person. Perhaps they have better training, perhaps they take schooling more seriously, perhaps they are smarter, but don’t ever discount the crooked factor. That’s a big factor in how they acquire their wealth.

            “We can never keep up with their scheming.”
When it was suggested to Moustache Man that the Jews should be moved out of Europe and made to reside in Palestine, he reportedly replied by saying that they would simply have a bolt-hole where they could perfect their schemes in safety. He was obviously saying that Palestine is too close to Europe.

            It is hard to be optimistic, at least in the short and medium term. Just look at the economy. There is a good chance that we are in a recession, but the liars say otherwise. They cannot tell the trust about anything now.

                            I would think those would be even more common out in the sticks, only as sport.  If I lived out in the sticks and there was a good backstop, it would be a great place to shoot.

                                I live in a 98.6% white town and I hear gunfire almost daily from one of the three gun clubs or from people shooting on their own property.
It’s a very comforting and pleasing sound to hear pop-pop-pop in the distance while I’m raking leaves in the Fall and knowing it’s white guys shooting trap.

                            We need to visit Z’s new place and play the new game I just invented – Basketraps! You dribble a basketball up to the “free fire” line on the pavement, then a line of gunmen open fire on it. First bullet to hit the ball wins! We handicap the better shooters by making them hold their weapons sideways, Baltimore style.

                        Zman, saw your recent Telegram post (fwiw it kept freezing and then skipping when I watched it).  Very appealing creek.  Isn’t it lovely to look out the window and see trees and vistas instead of brick, concrete, and diversity?  Oh, and if you really want to see your cats go nuts hang a hummingbird feeder outside your screened-in porch.

                            Hummers are marvels of God, but I don’t think there are too many up in Z’s neck o’ the woods. They tend to be more of a southwestern critter. There are certainly some in West Texas, and scads of them in southern New Mexico.

                                Ostei:  I think they are all throughout the US, and move north/south along with the seasons.  I have two feeders up on my porch and dozens of birds thronging each one.  When I sit on the porch to watch them, they will often fly over and hover in one spot quite near me. My neighbor said they used to land on his daughter’s hand.  But you are correct – they are marvels of God (almost exactly what my husband says).  Cannot watch them and not see God’s designing hand.

                Yeah, the economic situation is wild. We are essentially in “stagflation,” and that presents a multitude of political and financial problems. If it is admitted that we are in recession, the People Who Matter will demand interest rate cuts and a return to free money, which will accelerate inflation. Normally the political demand is to do this because rate cuts juice the economy, but the primary Dirt gripe now is high prices rather than unemployment and a sluggish financial markets. The open border has deformed the labor market so much that a true accounting is impossible. The Empire of Lies claims full employment, which is true as far as it goes, and hides the actual rate of inflation, which is well north of ten percent. I’m not even certain the analogy to the Seventies is sufficient. Actual wages are falling, inflation is off the charts, and the markets are sideways.Even the prospect of war is different from normal since the United States and its vassals very well could take it on the chin this time (to rehash, the prospect of nuclear war is quite real, too), so outside of the MIC there are extreme jitters. We easily could suffer a recession that would dwarf 2008 under current circumstances. If Powell relents and reintroduces free money, the population’s righteous anger over prices will dial up to 11. If he doesn’t, and the uncertainty grows simultaneously over a war that easily could go south, the markets may tank. While the vassal states will do dipsy doodles to prevent the results from having any effect, the recent election returns throughout Europe indicate the depth of rage brewing. Westerners are not going to fight a bloody war willingly or quietly accept their economic destruction, so what’s on tap? Lockdowns?

                    I heard the fed is buying up all those low interest long term bonds at full face value.  They are probably afraid of another SVB incident.  The fact that this helps their banking buddies is just icing on the cake.  They get to raise their interest rates without taking a haircut on all those 30 year .25 bonds they bought.

                Domestically, it is hard to be optimistic, but I see a glimmer of hope with other countries. The RoW has woken up to the game and is working to break away. That’s the way that you beat the schemers. Just don’t deal with them.
That’s their kryptonite. Granted, it’s a lot easier to do that when they don’t run your country, but it’s still good to understand how to beat them.

                Z: “It is hard to be optimistic, at least in the short and medium term.”Concerning the long term, however, Pew Research just dumped a whole bunch of new sociological data, and their numbers indicate that White democrats are headed straight for extinction:Pew Research CenterJune 5, 2024https://tinyurl.com/2swenwt8/QUESTION: “Society is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority”DEM: 19% agreeGOP: 59% agree[For the record, the GOP figures are not exactly encouraging, unless maybe the GOP respondents felt that somehow the question might imply government initiatives which could prove to be a threat to Homeschooling?]BTW, if you wanna see what happens when you live under a “1-Child” policy, for about three or four decades, then go to your favorite search engine, and search on strings such as“China empty real estate developments”“China empty apartments”“China empty skyscrapers”“China empty houses”“China empty mansions”“China empty shopping malls”The pictures you’ll see are simply horrifying.PS: As always, the V@xxpocalypse will have the final say in all matters concerning demographics.

                    Between sizable cohorts of white Democratic voters turning LGBTQ+ themselves, the remaining white straights having no children (or at most one child) and neutering what children they do have, the Democratic Party will be a majority minority party by 2050, led by an  ever-shrinking white leftist elite.

                        I was thinking; if you round up 19% to 20%, then that means only ONE IN FIVE Democrats give a d@mn about propagating their familial bloodlines.And the 59% Republican figure was still bothering me; so let’s go ahead and round that up to 60%, or THREE IN FIVE.Then you’re looking at:4-out-of-5 Democrats do not give a d@mn aboutpropagating their familial bloodlines.2-out-of-5 Republicans do not give a d@mn about propagating their familial bloodlines.I was thinking about that, and it dawned on me; could it be that the elderly in each party are clutching dearly to their precious Social Security &amp; Medicare, and they simply don’t give a damn about succeeding generations?Have the elderly been behaviorally-trained into a reptilian state which leaves them jealous of their own children &amp; grandchildren &amp; great-grandchildren?Have Social Security &amp; Medicare largely destroyed the bonds between the older generations and the younger generations?We still have bajillions of Silents on Social Security [born as late as 1945, the youngest Silents are still only 79 years old in 2024; they could easily live another 15 or 20 years].We’re just now nearing Peak Boomer; 1960 was the year with the largest number of White births in USA history, and that massive 1960 birth cohort doesn’t hit the books until 1960 + 65 = 2025.I’m worried that modernity has produced so many elderly atheists, so terrified of Death, that they’ll starve their grandchildren &amp; great-grandchildren if that’s what it takes for them to keep getting their Social Security checks in the mail, and their free hospital visits.

                        One other thing I thought of – the elderly might be sufficiently cynical to realize that most money spent on “children” in the USA will ackshually be spent on immigrants, and maybe the elderly want to make sure that the money is spent on ackshual Amurrikkkun citizens [???].

        This dynamic is not surprising when your country gets taken over by a tiny cohort of people known for legalistic thinking, tedious thousand-year debates over the meaning of specific words and phrases, and a type of sorcery where you can conjure up reality based on the words you use.

        “Obviously, the Russians are not going to be tricked by such nonsense”
The Russians are increasingly thinking — and now talking — of using tactical nuclear warheads. The bullshit of the US regime won’t wash with them. A couple of interesting recent pieces by Gilbert Doctorow:
https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2024/06/09/russias-news-of-the-week-explains-putin-on-the-asymmetric-response-to-western-missiles-fired-from-ukraine/
https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2024/06/07/cuban-missile-crisis-2-0/
The Russians mean business. The US Shere Khan, with its pack of mangy European jackals, is nudging us all into a no-holds-barred WW3.

            Not quite. The Russians have other less drastic and more effective options. Putler set the Uke patriot  rage heads off when he said he’ll just start supplying long range stuff to America’s enemies.
But In all probability if NATO starts playing hide-the-salami with the F16’s…the Russians will just obliterate the few remaining Uke airfields. Or just say ‘to hell with it!” And level Kiev and occupy the country.

                Yep, I’d highly suspect that Russian’s threat to arm groups/countries that could hit US forces has caused the Pentagon to start sending the word up to the neocons to quit screwing around.
I also agree that Russia, instead of first hitting air bases in Poland, would do its best to knock out the Uke air bases and to really hammer Ukr’s power infrastructure. “Fine, you use Polish and Romanian air bases. We knock out your power grid. Let’s see who lasts longer.”

                    The problem with that is that they have nobody to replace him.
Gavin Hairdo is even more unpopular than Biden. And if they don’t promote Camel the Harris to take his place, they lose the black women’s vote.

            There’s any number of ways the Russian’s can f-around with the West.
Openly basing nuclear tipped hypersonic missiles in Cuba comes to mind.  Since the US has been maliciously trying to turn Cuba into Haiti for 60 years because of US domestic politics, I’m sure they’d be open to it.
Cutting some deep sea internet cables would be untraceable and cause a panic.
The US has already done the same in both cases (weapons on Russian border, blowing up NordStream) and the whole world knows it.

            I really don’t see the Russians nuking anyone.  For one, Russia has the sympathy and good will of 1/2 or more of the world right now.  That would evaporate overnight if they nuked anyone.  But second, it’s a pointless escalation and extremely dangerous.  The leaders of Russia do not want Russia destroyed in Armageddon.  Russia using a nuke would raise the stakes of every single missile they launch against either Ukraine or any other place.  While the results of a nuclear exchange would be just as bad for the GAE, it is the one area where the GAE possesses a real advantage.My guess, and that is all it could ever be, is that if there is a nuclear exchange, it will be because we started it.

I agree. The mad dogs in the GAE will start it. But the Russians are telling the mad dogs — as if they’re listening, but that’s another matter — that if the GAE starts it, the Russians are prepared for retaliation. Do ya feel lucky? Well do ya, punk?

                The biggest advantage the GAE has is it doesn’t give a rat’s ass about its people, or any people for that matter, with the possible exception of the Juice.  And then, maybe only the more upper class ones.

            Definitely a Jew thing, but the Jewish hostile takeover of America (and thus the West) has allowed scheming whites to rise as well. The culture of the American elite is ostensibly Jewish at this point. The managerial class has a Jewish ethos. It’s not surprising that some whites thrive in the culture. But the vast majority of whites don’t.

                Torah and Talmud- the written Constitutions of that culture- are rules piled upon rules, the infamous bureaucratic pile of regulations called Mosaic law.The regulations must, as in MUST, all be complied with as God’s commands. Even if contradictory or conditions changed.What is to be done?The biggest part of the writings is how to recognize, yet get around this haphazard mess. Since religion is the expression of what is within a people, their natural bent, the constant clever workarounds are the preeminent aspect of this type of thought, taught since the child first begins to speak.Culturally, they select for scheming. Remember, these are a people whose finest moment was outsmarting the King of the Gods in order to win a Covenant.

                    Also, a second comment. Citizen’s idea- that our elites are a breakaway parallel culture with a Jewish ethos- struck me while reading about the Black Nobility.The Black Nobility are the medieval families of Europe centered about the Vatican, portrayed as the bosses of the Rothschilds and Chabad.(The Rome of Revelation’s Jerusalem and Rome thrones of the Antichrist.)The question that vexes me is how much chicken, how much egg.Who are the OG, the Original Gangsters?Jack Dobson’s Judeo-Puritan Question- who influences who- is a mirrored by the “Milners”, British AngloSaxon imperialists whose vision was either pitched to them by, or enabled by, the Judaic influence. The same can be said of the Enlightenment Free Masons who founded this country, or of Islam, a Judeo-Arabic construct.Ultimately, I’m trying to get back to the origin. How was it that an Afro-Aryan minority was able to suborn the Aryan majority in whose cities they began? How did the broken branch come to rule the tree, to the point of replacing its history and identity with their own?Does the system breed the ethos, which is then anchored in genetic/cultural selection, or does the genetic ethos breed the system?(That “system’s” origin then, would be the first city-states, the water kingdoms that arose from the harnessing of mass agriculture.)

                        Well, we know that European nobility had been using – and been used by – Jews for a very long time.The Jews collected the taxes, thus drawing the direct heat from the peasants. In addition, the nobility would borrow from the Jews to fund wars or whatever. This benefited the nobleman. And if the Jews got a bit uppity or the peasants started getting too mad or the nobleman couldn’t pay back the loan, he’d just kick them out. He held the ultimate power.The Jews, of course, got something out of the deal as well. They got a slice of the tax collection pie and were allowed to operate as money lenders in society, which gave them a very good living and a lot of influence.You’ll notice that neither the nobility nor the Jews cared about or even thought of themselves as part of the actual people. Jews and the nobility both considered themselves to be a separate and superior group to the peasants.It’s not surprising that these two groups started to influence one another.I think that the big change came with the industrial revolution, the Enlightenment and the creep of democracy. The nobility lost their ability to simply crush the Jews when needed. In essence, the Jews were unchained and able to operate freely with no counterforce.This allowed them to rise throughout the 19th century and 20th, going from serving the halls of power to being allowed in the halls of power to finally taking over the halls of power.

            These are people who always look for a way to slither around the rules by playing word games to evade the spirit behind the written rules.
Or as it was put by a 20th century philosopher:
Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again.

        Outsiders were let into the country and given equal social status.   That’s really all there is to it.  It is socially invalid to say, “That person is a Jew.  He is an outsider.  His identity is different from ours.  His words should be treated as poison.”. No we have to accept him as our social equal.  This is the foundational lie of America.  This is the seed of America’s destruction.  And it’s not just Jews.  It’s any outside identity being given equal social status.

            Good point. However, the Other no longer enjoys mere equality but instead preference. This is a logical inversion.

        In every aspect of life, clever schemers are either crafting documents that conceal their intent or they are reinterpreting commonly understood words and phrases so they can claim some new intent behind the words. This is driven not just by a disrespect for the intent behind the words, but a disregard for the very idea of rules.The redefinition of commonly understood words by leftists has been one of their greatest rhetorical tools against bedazzled “conservatives”. As the late Lawrence Auster wrote, it is absolutely important, in any serious discussion on a subject, to define certain terms –especiallythose terms that are thrown about with the intent to smear (“racist” comes to mind).Of course, leftists very rarely want aseriousdiscussion on pressing issues – which is likely why they do it. Nevertheless, pointing this out and insisting on appropriate definitions instead of mindlessly throwing labels is surely a benefit.Enoch Powell was known to be exceptional at doing this. I link the following video (it is about 10 minutes in length), which made a great impression on me for reasons I note below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuH8kb1u1igFirst, Powell forces the interviewer to define what he means; perhaps dragging him into more of a duel of intellects than he would want.Second, Powell never uses weasel-words, he never looks down, he is constantly staring the interviewer down. He shows no submissive nature whatsoever.And finally, Powell directly – about midway through the video – talks of evil. He is under no illusion of the severity of the matter (even then – it was 1976).In any case, words matter.

            Powell was such a remarkable gentleman–fearless, great intellect, educated and erudite. People two standard deviations below his IQ would kick him out of the present day British National Party, let alone the “Conservatives,” for “hate.” In a perfect world, a towering monument to him would be placed in his equivalent of Trafalgar Square. In this world, Trafalgar’s monument will be removed at some point.

                    Jack,
You’re correct about Powell. He was truly a good man, and a towering intellect. It is a great shame that, even in 1976, he faced an uphill battle.
Here’s a very short one from 1993 (five years or so before he died). Note, he is older and much slower, but there is not a hint of apology or submission or regret. Notably, when pressed to condemn “thugs” who like his views, he doesn’t throw them under the bus:

God bless him.

                    It is depressing.  If someone like Powell had no chance 50 years ago, what chance is there now?  Less than none.  It’s been over for a long time.  I don’t know what the future holds, but I don’t see Victory in it.

        Maybe the start of the decline was the “penumbras formed by emanations” clause in William O. Douglas’ majority opinion in the 1965 Griswold case. The people that run the country wanted to send women into the workforce to cut wages and increase profits. Hence, legalized contraception, then abortion in 1973, in which the Roe decision quoted Griswold. Douglas was a degenerate in his personal life, so it was fitting he wrote the lies. 1965 also was the year of the open-borders law, LBJ’s Great Society, escalating the Vietnam War, etc. The birth rate went from 4.0 in the 1950s to 1.6 today.https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/381/479/

        Halfway expect something in the way of an “AVG” or “American Volunteer Group” for Ukraine as was done for China in 1940-41. Better known as “The Flying Tigers”, they were active service members of the USAAF, USMC, &amp; US Navy who resigned their U.S. commissions to serve in the Chinese Air Force flying against the Japanese. Some of these guys became world famous &amp; you’ve heard of them: Robert L Scott, Gregory “Pappy” Boyington, John Allison, &amp; Walter “Tex” Hill, to name a few.
Probably the world’s most famous group of mercenaries. Things were of course better organized back then.

                Always – &amp; barely – one step ahead of a USMC court martial. He was a hard drinking, skirt chasing, barroom brawler. After the AVG he had to fight the Marine Corps to establish him @ his old rank, then fought the attempt to put him on the bench because of his advance age (hence the nickname “Pappy”). Through subterfuge &amp; audacity he begged/borrowed/stole both aircraft &amp; pilots for his fighter squadron VMF 214, aka “The Black Sheep”. While the higher ups wanted to see him hang, they couldn’t ignore his squadron’s success. He was bold &amp; it showed. After the war he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. A colorful character to be sure. The “Black Sheep Squadron” tv series – aside from based on him &amp; the squadron – was all Hollywood BS. He rode the wave though, more $$ &amp; more press. He even guest starred several times &amp; struck up a friendship with actor Robert Conrad, who portrayed him in the series. They got along famously.  Conrad was – like Boyington – himself a hard drinking, skirt chasing, barroom brawler.

            If I’m not mistaken, there were active duty US personnel in Europe (UK) assisting in “their” war effort, well before the Anime Club visited Pearl Harbor.

        In law enforcement, particularly in big cities, there aren’t enough LEOs to catch all the criminals so they must resort to making a very public example of taking down a few bad guys in order to dissuade others that may be similarly inclined. This technique is a form of group behavior modification and it is similarly applied in many societal venues, some of which are nefarious in their intent. For example, systematic lying can spread like a cancer. One could argue that the pathogens responsible for destroying Western civilization are engaged in mass scale behavior modification in service to their nefarious ends. But what would happen if even a few of these pathogens had to think twice about turning the ignition key on their auto? That too is a form of behavior modification.

        Taken to its (il-)logical extreme, the Administrative State probably results in something like a Soviet Union especially in its declining decades (which was most of them.) They had a written constitution and a system of laws. Yet these were routinely ignored and (I suppose) reinterpreted as the needs of the moment required. There were curious exceptions such as recounted in the non-fiction (?) writings of Solzhenitsyn: a prisoner well versed in the law could demand a certain amount of daily bread stipulated by law. Or Bukovsky with his accounts of prisoners using processes of complaint or appeal to gum up the administrative works. What we in the West might think of as fundamental rights might be abrogated (e.g. freedom of speech or a fail trial), yet the managerial state was still beholden to followsomeof its procedures, even those initiated by a political prisoner. Perhaps this behavior is not so much exceptions to the (ignored) rules, but merely a set of symptoms of a terminally dysfunctional regime.

        Regarding the F-16s, a scheme to land them in Ukraine, arm them, and take off again to attack Russia is not going to work because the F-16 intake requires antiseptically clean runways (a couple of pebbles can blow up the engine) and those don’t exist in the Ukraine…So they would need to be based and armed in Poland or Rumania, and those bases would be hit by Russian missiles….,

            Yes, baiting Russia into attacking F-16s on NATO bases and howling about Article V seems to be the plan.
The problem is that the Russian air defenses and long range air-to-air missiles are good enough to swst away piecemeal F-16 sorties without touching another NATO country.

        The Clinton thing was used by the liberal media to overshadow a lot more of his grand jury testimony which was far more damning. It’s an Ur-“but I did eat breakfast this morning” moment.Clinton actually split it into two questions. He asked if “is” referred only to the present moment (1), or covered all past cases and time (2). Sort of like, “is there a Mona Lisa?” Well, yes, there is one right at this moment, but the meaning is far more expansionist than that than merely ostensive definition.He believed that if someone asked him on Tuesday if he “is in a sexual relationship with Miss Lewinsky” and he was not engaged in sexual relations with her at that moment, then no, he was not in a sexual relationship, according to definition (1). But, if it was definition (2), then yes, he was in one.Sure, everyone understands the common meaning of words, but let’s not forget, this was grand jury testimony with a fed. Clinton knew long before Mike Flynn not to trust any of them.

        Jack and others yesterday pointed out the proliferation of Regulations and Administrative Law. These cannot be emphasized enough. Even if you think you’re abiding by the “law”, there’s doubtless some regulation you’re violating.

        Zman, I must protest and defend my home.  The Clinton’s had nothing whatsoever to do with the Ozarks!!  Hope, Arkansas is in the southwest flatlands of the state.  We made a pit stop there on our first trip through Arkansas, and were greeted by the sight of hijabed females.  No such thing up in the hills and hollers, at least as of yet.   As with any place, just avoid the cities – Bentonville in the northwest which Walmart has flooded with subcons, Eureka Springs with its sexual degenerates.  The only mosques and synagogues in the state are in the northwest (Fayetteville – university town with spillover of subcons from Bentonville) and down in LittleRock.

In the 90s, it was thought that Bill Clinton was moving the party to the center and willing to concede certain things to Republicans like doma and welfare reform.In hindsight, it was just the democratic party mutating/metastasizing into something worse than the dopey liberalism of McGovern or Mondale ever was

                The Brandon entity has fended off the attacks for a long time, starting with their choice of VP. Yet, there is stuff that is coming out now can realistically only be coming from that entity, and just putting him out in public where he can make a fool of himself is part of that. I still think the RNC is going to manuever to replace Trump on the ballot with “Nikki” Haley (there’s a reason she’s still out there quasi-campaigning) but I doubt there is anyone within the Dem blob that they could all coalesce behind. Definitely not Kamala – she was obviously replacement insurance from day one. Definitely not Gavin Newsome – he’s White.  But yea, it’s interesting.As Z mentioned in his pod, the debate may be the final act for Biden if he makes a fool of himself, or unloads his diaper, or what have you.

                    I think there is, or at least was, a tacit understanding that Trump would be yanked and then Biden, and the public would be sold it as a fair result. “See, we both decided to do the right thing!” The Trump conviction and upcoming imprisonment have not yielded the intended results. It’s all good, as far as I am concerned, because public support of the Regime cannot crater enough. I honestly believe that if 911 was replayed today there would be as much domestic celebration as there would be rage, and that would not have been conceivable even a decade ago. Bridges burned AND nuked. Such genius. If they fuck around and get into a war, the public disgust and disdain will be apparent immediately. Toby Keith’s cancer was an omen.

                        If another 911 occurred today, I would lament the loss of innocent civilian life but heartily cheer the damage done to the BFE in general. As you say, this pose would have been unthinkable for me 10 years ago.

                        It’s possible. I could easily see the Dems and Republicans getting together and saying, “we are getting rid of Orange Man Bad and Senile Joe for the good of the country, here is Gavin vs. “Nikki.” In fact that might be the only way that either of them get replaced. Although, if that happens, it has to be soon. I, too, agree that it would likely crater support for the regime and I am quite fine with that.

        There’s the smart set in the world that think that words have power. We saw it back in the Saddam days where they all sat together and said “We took a vote and you are bad and it must stop.” Saddam continued to put people in industrial shredders and his sons continued to rape. The smart set sent another letter, etc… I’m reminded of the hashtag diplomacy of Michelle Obama #bring back our girls. Your hubby had at his disposal countless military options, but… You see it now with Trump. All the smart set wanted was to be able to sniff and say “… convicted felon Donald Trump.” Magic words.
