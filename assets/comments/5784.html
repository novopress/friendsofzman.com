        …Appeasement.Cause it worked so well in the past.
Actually, I enjoy it when the revolution (that these same universities fomented)starts eating their own.Another ‘cheese eating surrender monkey’ bites the dust.Good riddance.Soylent Green…It’s college presidents!

        I am curious. If the ‘athletes of colour’ refuse to play a game, why is it important? Yes, I know the pull of sports and televised sports and sponsorship and ‘reputation’ and all that, but if someone withdraws their labour (or labor) then that is their choice. I presume, if the University cannot fulfil their fixtures, they will be fined or suspended or whatever, but if no one wants to play for them then so be it.Sometimes these threats have to be allowed to ‘mature’ and can be shown what for they are: worthless gestures that make no difference to the world. I am sure all the people who do not want to play for their college can easily find things to do (like studying) or even find a job elsewhere. Probably plenty of well-paid work around, so the football was just a passing thing.As for the top man and ‘how he handled things’ surely how the criminals ‘handle things’ is more relevant.

            That’s the lesson you see repeatedly. Apologize and you get destroyed. Grovel and you get kicked in the face. Give them an inch and they take a kilometer. The best course is to never apologize and always attack, attack, attack. It’s why Trump is where he is in the polls. The press takes a shot at him and his reply is “so what? Now, let’s talk about your warts.”

        No, we don’t automate warehouses because we are afraid to confront employees who make mistakes. We automate because mistakes are expensive. Because accurate inventory locations allow us to save money on inventory investment. We do it because having five inventory control clerks is an expensive indulgence.

        Wolfe resigns. What a tool.“The frustration and anger that I see is clear, real, and I don’t doubt it for a second,” Wolfe said at a press conference announcing his resignation. “I take full responsibility for this frustration and for the inaction that has occurred … My resignation comes out of love, not hate.”———–What utter bullshit.And from the Atlantic…….“…..According to The Columbia Missourian, just 7 percent of the overall student body is black, but nearly half of the football team is (60 of 124 players). …..”Just?  Missouri is only 11.7% black, with nearly all in KC or St Louis and their inner-ring suburbs (Ferguson, anyone?).  Knowing that at least half the black inner city population is incapable of so much as tying its own shoes, that 7 percent number tells me they are arguably over-represented.Something tells me that outside the fever swamps of Mizzou’s noted Journalism School and ultra pricey/uber liberal Washington U. in St Louis, this will not play well among the rubes.

        Yale is much worse. What was once a great university has been reduced, after affirmative action and feminism, to a play-doh safe space.

            One of these days I’ll do another post on my Yale experience as a old guy visiting from the land beyond the horizon. I felt like I was visiting another planet.
