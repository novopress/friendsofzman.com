        Excellent post, Zman.  It gave me a better understanding of the nexus of global energy supplies/pipelines and the dollar, beyond my ‚Äô70s understanding of the origins of the petrodollar.  I am no fan of Erdogan, but Israel talking about attacking Turkey is insanity.  But then, the whole world is insane, with paeans about Carter filling the web.  I‚Äôve had enough of this today ‚Äì I‚Äôm going grocery shopping,  putting out more corn for the deer, and reading a crappy escapist book. I‚Äôll check back in later to learn more from the many wise commenters here.

            Yes, agreed. I never quite thought of the situation in those terms.
Heretofore, my difficulty was in describing the war against Russia as mindless hate left over from the Cold War.  Energy control throws a whole new light on the issue.  That I can understand.

                Yes, as Jannie (and others, I‚Äôm sure) had said, it‚Äôs the Great Game redux.I once saw the blurb for a book named ‚ÄúOil Spies‚Äù, about the fascinating and secretive world of the international Gilded Age agents during the world‚Äôs conversion from coal steam to oil boilers.I‚Äôll be darned if I can find that book on search again, to my great regret. Theirs were the sorts of exploits mixing James Bond with the Wild West and Indiana Jones. Very steampunk. High intrigue and low chicanery. Such a genre would rival cinematic Westerns, WWII, or Lawrence of Arabia in its sweep and scope.While i‚Äôm at it, let me include the first three minutes of the most compelling romantic meeting I‚Äôve ever seen.  From the series ‚Äú1923‚Äù, the Contessa of Sussex breaks the ice in an African bar with a hardbitten American veteran of WW1.https://youtu.be/vmfYoVYgRmc?si=27jP3jyr8I1fHzZtYou can almost see the sparks fly, the lightning strike, the magnetic pull.imagine if we had our own Magawood putting out bigscreen epics around the underappreciated era of the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of the White West order.  White people need to be celebrated again- we gave them not only the oil, but the movies too.

                Add in that we got the Jewish technocrats that ruined the USSR in the 1980‚Äôs. Their children are now in positions of power and influence. Thus the government is far more focused on revenge on Russia than it does anything to do with governance of America.

        We‚Äôre caught in a vicious bind. On the one hand, we‚Äôre prevented from exploiting our own energy resources to the fullest by an assortment of political and social forces whose motivations are somewhat suspect. On the other hand, our foreign policy is being dictated by Christians dazzled by Old Testament gobbeltygook and Jewish lobbying. There seems to be no way out of this by rational means.

                If you spend a lot of time around the US military, you‚Äôll notice a significant shortage of soldiers, sailors, and airmen of Indian descent.

                    I remember an article inProceedings (mid/late 80‚Äôs), a magazine published by the US Naval Institute, by a Jewish naval officer lamenting the lack of representation of Jews in service. Kudos to the writer for noticing and writing about the lack of tangible patriotism (within the context of the civic nationalism we all believed back then), but his choice of publication was suboptimal.Jews one might want to reach with that message weren‚Äôt reading Proceedings in the first place. He would have been better off in Tablet, or whatever hardcopy equivalent they had back then. Regardless, his message would have fallen on deaf ears.

            We export most of the oil we produce.  We don‚Äôt have refineries capable of refining the oil we produce. You cannot just put any oil in any old refinery.  But we are still a huge net importer.
The people exporting our natural gas should be arrested and tried for treason.

                    It‚Äôs not worth building new refineries for this tight oil we are producing.  You build a refinery for 30-50 years of supply.AFAIK, the average tight oil well peaks in like 12-18 months and falls off a cliff which we hope will produce a small amount of oil for decades.

                This is why I always laugh at people who think America‚Äôs light, sweet crude will bring us energy independence, some now even claiming they want energy dominance.  Try producing diesel or jet fuel from what we have.  Oh you can‚Äôt?  That means the US Military still has to rely on foreign energy sources to function.  Not a good position to be in when it is that very military that is relied upon to uphold the global energy system.  Seems like a pretty major vulnerability in terms of national security.

                    It‚Äôs amazing to me how many people I run into who think we are already a net exporter of oil and some kind of energy superpower.  Even people here believe we are a net oil exporter.  While it varies slightly from quarter to quarter, we import like 1/2 of our oil and that includes the net from the light sweet crude we cannot refine and ship elsewhere.

            well yes, that is what ubiquitous nuke power would do.  if ford and gm get all the electricity they need for free, does that affect their competitiveness?   free electricity from nukes would also destroy every petrodollar based society (i.e. the arabs).

                Electricity will never be free, even if we could generate it for free, which we cannot. The grid is a very expensive and complex machine which needs constant expensive maintenance and repair. Big companies like GM and Ford and Alcoa et al get much cheaper rates than we do. It‚Äôs unlikely they could make it themselves any cheaper.I heard a lot of companies are now buying batteries to run their factories (operating as a very large UPS, with the battery sitting between the grid and factory). This guy:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrWBLtna_ywsays he is making good money doing this due to the destabilization of the power grid with all this renewable stuff on the grid. He claims production machinery is extremely sensitive to the problems caused by random renewables connected to the grid. But I have no idea who this guy is, so he may be full of malarkey.

            The long-term national interest requires a robust nuclear sector to balance fossil fuels, as well as an extensive retrofitting of the existing energy grid.
Both of which would take decades, create hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs, reduce both the cost of energy and the amount used, and move us towards autkarkic prosperity and an improvement of the general welfare.
Which is why it will never happen without a few industry, lobbyist and congressional heads being separated from their shoulders.

            When petroleum gets scarce, nuclear power will bail out mankind.  Wind and Solar are just fetishes.
On a side note, how crazy are the Germans to shut down all their nuke plants, while neighboring countries continue to open new nuclear power plants?

                Almost nobody burns petroleum to make electricity.  I think there are a few countries that do, but it‚Äôs a literal hand full like Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.  Even in Venezuela, it‚Äôs only like 11%.But we do burn a lot of natural gas for electric generation, which is why the people exporting it should be locked up and charged as traitors.I seriously doubt nuclear is a panacea, at least with current nuclear technology as deployed.  They use uranium which is fairly limited, especially considering most of the uranium is not fissionable.  Unless a miracle happens and we are able to crack the nut of slow controllable fusion, nuclear will always be a marginal source of electricity.

                My understanding is we haven‚Äôt built new refineries in forever.  Not sure why, probably a combo of cost, perhaps excess capacity (or wanting to keep a lid on the supply) and environmental/bureaucratic red tape.
That is another ‚Äúchoke point‚Äù to control the world.  Crude is great, but it does not become useful until refined.  The smart money wouldn‚Äôt bomb foreign oil fields ‚Äì you bomb foreign refineries and embargo replacement parts.

                It has become for practical purposes impossible, in AINO, to build either a new refinery or a new pipeline, due to litigation and lawfare from ‚Äúenvironmentalists.‚Äù Who funds them and why is another question, but they never lack funding. And their resistance is absolute and uncompromising. For instance, Massachusetts prefers importing Russian gas to allowing a gas pipeline to be built from Pennsylvania.

                The environmental review process to build a new refinery is ruinously expensive and takes forever. Also, you‚Äôll likely face litigation from the enviro-nuts and NIMBYs that‚Äôll take years to resolve.That‚Äôs not a bug, but a feature since half of our political class wants to condemn us to the buggy-whip era by ending our ‚Äúdependence‚Äù on oil and replace it with wind and solar, which are expensive, useless pipe dreams.Also, you can‚Äôt make plastics and many other products out of sometimes-on electricity generated by wind and solar.The existing refineries are under assault by state and federal regulators for ‚Äúclean air‚Äù violations and workplace ‚Äúviolations.‚Äù My old man worked for 27 years at a refinery and he said dealing with the federal EPA and OSHA scumbags was a constant headache.Any refinery can handle ‚Äúsweet‚Äù crude, but only a select few are set up to handle the ‚Äúsour‚Äù stuff with lots of benzene and other nasty gunk.Most of the existing refineries in the U.S. have been expanded multiple times to make up for the loss of so many other refineries, but we‚Äôve made our system weaker by putting too many valuable eggs in too few baskets. You have a hurricane on the Gulf Coast, it‚Äôs guaranteed to result in the shutdowns of several giant refineries, thus increasing prices. Ditto for a fire or just standard maintenance.Add in the EPA regs requiring ‚Äúwinter‚Äù and ‚Äúsummer‚Äù gasoline formulations and our ruling class have made a mess out of the oil industry as they do with everything else.

                Because fractional distillation only gives you the fraction of each component that already exists.  Gasoline is roughly 5-12 carbon chains, diesel is roughly 10-20 carbon chains, so there is a little overlap that can be directed to either stream, depending on what the rest of the feedstock is. The lighter the feedstock, the more the gasoline fraction.Because so much of our usage is diesel, heating oil, jet fuel and higher carbon strings, light isn‚Äôt a very good feedstock. It‚Äôs much easier to take a 21-carbon heavier feedstock and ‚Äúcrack‚Äù it into 3 seven carbon chains than the other way around. That is, you can fairly easily turn diesel into gasoline, but it‚Äôs difficult to go the other way.

                    Global warming is just a means to an end.  They have hated oil a long time, long before oil was tied to AGW.  The real goal is 15 minute cities and the end of personal automobile ownership.But oil production is safe.  Even if they manage to totally do away with personal automobiles, we still need diesel, bunker fuel, aviation fuel, lubricating oil etc. No end to the need for oil.  The funny thing is we will have to sell the gasoline. You cannot just not make gasoline when you need diesel etc. Some fraction of oil is natural gasoline and it must be driven off before the heavier fuels like the above mentioned fuels.

                    A couple of recent studies should have ended the climate change hoax once and for all, but as of right now everybody is just kind of pretending not to have noticed
New Study Reveals Oceans Absorb More CO2 Than Previously Thought
Plant CO2 Uptake Rises by Nearly One Third in New Global Estimates
This means ALL of the prior models were not just wrong but way, way wrong

        So now Trump is saying getting out of Ukraine isn‚Äôt so assured &amp; a war with Iran can happen, quite the about face from what he‚Äôs been saying for the last year. Naturally he also agrees with elon in wanting to drown America with street shitters, something he said should be outlawed all the way back in 2016.There‚Äôs what Trump personally wants to do then there‚Äôs his incessant approval seeking of those around him having a very strong influence on his policies. That‚Äôs at least part of the reason why his last term was so chaotic, everyone around him is playing king of the hill in regards to who can influence him. Obviously some people have a more commanding presence over him, like his daughter who was the face of a chain of proxies tracing through jared &amp; charles kushner to bibi. Now he‚Äôs kissing bibi‚Äôs ring directly &amp; given this is his last term he really doesn‚Äôt have to care about what his voters want, not that he cared all that much during his first term.I do wonder how much he will be vying for the approval of democrats who hate him, that &amp; the fraudulent investigation was very influential in how he behaved towards Russia last time around. Russia has no reason to budge an inch in negotiations meanwhile the people around Trump will want to keep this Ukraine business going forever &amp; will try to limit anything that stands in the way of that. Assuming Trump himself wants it to end he‚Äôs going to want to look like he wins in the exchange but again, there‚Äôs no reason for Russia to concede anything.Like always I just hope for a freeze on most of the damage, hoping for the best &amp; expecting the worst. I do hope that the reaction to H1B visas is a sign that people won‚Äôt be so sycophantic towards Trump‚Äôs inevitable campaign promise backstabs. If anything is going to change there needs to be a build up of anger instead of a steam valve release like last time he was in office.

            ‚ÄúLike always I just hope for a freeze on most of the damage, hoping for the best &amp; expecting the worst. I do hope that the reaction to H1B visas is a sign that people won‚Äôt be so sycophantic towards Trump‚Äôs inevitable campaign promise backstabs.‚ÄùI went to a couple of the 2015 Trump rallies. The average attendee will have a hard time remembering anything but they are in the presence of Donald Trump unfortunately. However, Trump‚Äôs want to have those rallies be popular means that he can‚Äôt bring it up. Therefore, I doubt increases will become a priority. I suspect unfortunately we will end up with the status quo. Thus keeping his rallies enjoyable and not ruffling the feathers of H1-B addict Musk.During the 2015 rallies, Trump was trying to push for more money for daycare for working women. Of the 2 rallies I attended, that talking point went over like lead balloon. It was dropped soon there after. In that, Trump does respond to popular sentiment. The problem is that he‚Äôs not holding rallies all the time.‚ÄúI¬†do wonder how much he will be vying for the approval of democrats who hate him, that &amp; the fraudulent investigation was very influential in how he behaved towards Russia last time around.‚ÄùHas he learned anything from having the election stolen and being out of office for 4 years about DC? We‚Äôll find out.

                He‚Äôs like dr jekyll &amp; mr hide when hes talking at rallies versus when he‚Äôs at events like the RNC, respectively. You‚Äôre right about him wanting to keep the rallies content though, he‚Äôs no doubt going to do some good things that he can brag about.I have to admit he does seem to make exuberant claims to not only his base but his donors as well. The thing that worries me is he really doesn‚Äôt have to answer for anything now that its his last term. At this point after biden I‚Äôm content with the status quo, that last year Trump was in office when he let fauci run wild really left an impression on me though, why I‚Äôm so cynical. Knocking on wood &amp; crossing my fingers he doesn‚Äôt do anything so damaging again.

            I wouldn‚Äôt get too riled yet. Say what ya want ‚Äì Trump is a money grubber just like the rest‚Ä¶ but unlike them, he knows how to deal. War is great for the profiteers but a misery to everyone else and very bad for business for everyone.monetarily the smart play is to remove Zelenskyy and the jewry that brought this about which will kneecap the profiteers‚Ä¶ and set the ‚ÄòKraine up as a neutral state. Properly negotiated by an adult, a win for everyone IS theoretically possible ‚Äì provided the right players buy off the right people.That is a very big ‚Äúif‚Äù‚Ä¶ but Blumpf has done it before‚Ä¶ so who knows?

            It‚Äôs actually worse than it appears.¬†Blockchain/crypto authenticates trustworthy actors as those who can afford to burn huge amounts of energy on meaningless algebra problems.¬†The idea is that an army of bots trying to falsify the blockchain could not afford the energy to perpetrate the fraud.¬†The authentication model is literally the ability to burn lots of energy.
It‚Äôs easy to get hysterical about the amount of energy consumed by blockchains, but this website says that ‚Äúa single crypto transaction consum[es] more energy than that required to power 6 houses for a day in the U.S.‚Äùhttps://www.energystar.gov/products/data_center_equipment/cryptocurrency

                According to Google it‚Äôs 708kwh per Bitcoin transaction.  That is insane.  Visa can do 100k transactions for 148kwh.
Crypto is nothing but scams.  It‚Äôs gone on longer than I imagined, but it will end in tears at some point.  It‚Äôs not just that crypto is a scam, it‚Äôs that everything around it is a scam.  It cannot deliver on any of its initial promises.  It was supposed to be an anonymizing currency, but it is neither anonymizing or a currency.  This has not deterred any of the Crypto fanatics (who all hold it).

                    As far as the blockchain ledger is concerned, your anonymity is about as close to perfect as we can hope.  However, your wallet on the blockchain has an address and that will become known (ask Anglin and Spencer).  People will be able to track your wallet activity.
The big exposure is connecting to the network of the blockchain. Internet service providers will have all of that logged. You can use some sort of anonymous internet service, but then the vulnerability is just pushed back to that service.

Third would be as a cover for military-grade AI development, such as the bipedal Terminator combat robots China just rolled out.

Until an entity like a country takes responsibility for its value, it seems to me to be based on the ‚Äúgreater fool‚Äù concept.Who cares if a crypto unit takes a billion dollars in energy to create?  Would our currency be worth more if the paper dollars cost a million dollars to print instead of seven cents?  Once created the dollar is intrinsically a piece of worthless paper, albeit you can burn it for heat or wipe your ass with it.  So is the Bitcoin worthless, unless someone wishes to exchange something of value for it.  Hence the greater fool concept.Is Bitcoin and derivatives the modern repeat of the tulip mania of Holland in the 17th century?

        An attack on Turkey by Israel would destroy NATO.  It would expose Article 5 as the BS it is.  Besides, I don‚Äôt think Israel is capable of defeating Turkey anyway.  Unlike their Arab neighbors, Turkey is capable of fighting back.

            Would it really? Even now, against all observable reality, NATO is still able to masquerade as a defensive alliance. If Turkey was attacked, the msm would just put out another NPC update. Are you suggesting that the Europeans will rebel against their American masters? I‚Äôll believe that when I see it.

        I‚Äôve been thinking about how the modern robber barons tried to invoke patriotism as a justification for bringing foreign scab labor into the country to displace, impoverish and immiserate the native white middle class population. The concept of robber barons of course brought up the natural reaction of unionization.Young white people especially should think about how the history of unionizing could provide inspiration for collective action towards economic and even physical self defense in a nakedly hostile and exploitive environment. There is no ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äô anymore that has any moral claim to your allegiance, only an increasingly authoritarian and rapacious political order made up of perverted aliens and race traitors that openly fear and despise you due to your collective potential arising from your genetic heritage.Obama‚Äôs administration initiated the age of identity, the political primacy of identity as organizing principle. Young white people have certainly been raised to view the world through that lens and I believe the history of labor unions could provide some inspiration and perhaps suggest strategies for exploiting current legal frameworks in coming years to fight for a future for themselves and their children.

        The petrodollar has required US military supremacy and the credible threat of military coercion against recalcitrant petrostates. US military power and the dollar have been two cards propping each other up in the rickety house of cards that is the US empire. The problem has been faltering military might.

            The military is really struggling now. Between the DEI rot and the constant waste, fraud and abuse present in the Pentagon and its acquisition programs, we‚Äôd be lucky to fight Canada and win. But that‚Äôs most Western militaries. The Brits are shrinking their military for the umpteenth time after the Cold War. The Germans just commissioned destroyer-sized frigates with NO LONG RANGE SURFACE TO AIR MISSILES that are basically Coast Guard cutters on steroids. The French military is also shrinking.The PRC now has the world‚Äôs largest navy and likely has the world‚Äôs largest air force and army as well. Not only that, the quality of their equipment is greatly improved.Everyone here at my work shit a brick when the PRC unveiled a tailless, delta-winged mystery aircraft that might be the world‚Äôs first sixth-generation (the F-22, F-35, the Russian Su-57 seen in Top Gun Maverick and Chinese J-20 are fifth-generation fighter aircraft) combat aircraft.

        The oil &amp; gas production industry has been boom and bust since its inception, and as a result, the majors formed a covert cartel in the 70s to minimize these fluctuations and create predictable revenue streams. As part of a master plan, transportation arteries are being created worldwide in order to manage this resource globally. In a perfect world, this implementation would be based solely on economic efficiency criteria, but NOOOO! Profligate governments have run up huge sovereign debts and are now relying on the rape of this revenue stream to keep the plates spinning a little longer. Thus far, the price of this corruption is about a million dead &amp; wounded white guys in Ukraine. It‚Äôs not just about the Benjamins, its about genocide of the Caucasian race.

        Your visits with Mike are always nice.Did we get any memes showing Elon plowing through a white Christmas market in one of his gay trucks (with diarrhea pouring from the exhaust)? Haven‚Äôt seen any, sadly. Anglin‚Ñ¢ was on vacation.Internet guys think the ‚Äúreal story‚Äù of Elon‚Äôs holiday was his reckless samefagging as Adrian Dittmann, the alternate identity he uses when he‚Äôs up all night on meth (or something like it). It‚Äôs notsolelyhis alt account, so he can deny it, but he doesn‚Äôt really, because he thinks it‚Äôs a genius op and wants credit for it, and he requires everyone (from his employees to strangers with twenty Twitter followers) to ass-kiss it. The Adrian character is your standard angry Reddit-soy Democrat, but dumber. Elon let some of Adrian‚Äôs mask-off anti-whiteness leak into his official account, which is what caused the backlash, but as Adrian he went full psycho for hours and hours all night all week. This is what Elon‚Äôs ‚Äú100 hour work week‚Äù is. He‚Äôs a drug NEET on UBI (billions of it).Apparently. The op may not be what it seems.Either way, we have further evidence that ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù is corporate, not governmental. The state is only leftist insofar as itsubmitsto finance capital.

        It might be nice if energy was backing the dollar, but that hasn‚Äôt been true for a long time, if it ever really was. Nothing stronger (or weaker) than pure faith and belief backs it. The petrodollar is not an end in itself, but a means to one, that being requiring people to hold dollars and trade in dollars. If they can‚Äôt make them do so for energy, they‚Äôll try to make them do so for some other reason(s). They just had a go at creating a pharmadollar, trying to force everyone to buy American and British ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù in perpetuity, but that fizzled out. I assure you they haven‚Äôt stopped plotting their next gambit.

        ‚ÄúSettling the Syria mess in such a way that the United States, through regional proxies, continues to control the flow of energy‚Ä¶‚Äù
A sidebar to this is the dismantling of Syria, specifically, Syrian air defenses. That dense cluster of air defence has been removed, clearing a corridor for Israeli jets to attack Iran(‚Ä¶and Turkey, I just realized).
Without in-air fueling, Israeli jets don‚Äôt have the reach to strike Iran and return; now they do, as their aerial tankers are no longer so vulnerable.
Isreali control of the energy region is a much bigger immediate incentive than some proposed Belt-Road positioning.

        America? We just voted for focusing on the nation ‚Äì the people. We just voted to begin restoring us as the reason for being. The big savior faction just unmasked itself as wanting to replace us from above and the regime has: DBI head; AI head; Civil Rights head; desecration of Our God by claiming Guru Devaswamydong as the one true God.This is a farce. It is allfor energy? We must import India and China to defeat India and China. Thus said the greatest genius of our time.They snarl and hate the people. Don‚Äôt you understand that you are a sports team? You have been cut to bring in ringers. That willmake you a winner!!It is beyond absurd. The powderkeg seems like a target by the grubby merchant ‚Äúelite.‚Äù

            Draining the SPR was a way to suppress fuel prices while undermining the oil and gas industry, especially the well-paid, tough, and highly independent white guys in the field.
This is just another example how much Biden and the ideological team around him hate red areas, the American heartland, and masculinity.

                Yeah the SPR exhaustion is a win all around for the Hive that runs the ‚ÄòBiden Team‚Äô.
When the Feminine rules a nation, following its period of Righteous Rebellion it soon turns to self-destruction.  The urge to obliterate oneself as a polity arises because both the created and natural order have been inverted.

            I don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs anything magical about 50%, but the greater number of transactions you do the processing on, the better the picture you have of global money flows. If you owned (or infiltrated or threatened or hacked) enough larger processors, you have a very good picture of what‚Äôs going on.

        I get a headache with this because there are wheels within wheels and tangled gear trains everywhere within it‚Ä¶ but I think you‚Äôre largely correct, Z.My question is Iran. Israel is alienating the hell out of everyone; and there are serious signs that the Arab world could unite against them. I strongly suspect that if Iran is attacked the Russians and the Turks may intervene. Equally troubling is the new arms showing up in the theatre‚Ä¶ remember that not too long ago, some obscure rag heads calling themselves ‚ÄúHooties‚Äù ‚Äì put the run on the US Navy in the Red Sea. The balance of power in the world is changing rapidly.Russia is now an economic powerhouse simply because they kicked the jews out of their finances, tied their currency to shiny rocks, put their own national interest first, and invested in their military as a legitimate defence industry and not as a grift‚Ä¶ If we want to maintain our place in the global marketplace we will ultimately have to do the same.

        Could this be why Trump started talking about buying Greenland: ‚ÄúUS Geological Survey (USGS) estimates around17.5 billion undiscovered barrels of oil and 148 trillion cubic feet of natural gasis contained in Greenland‚Äôs offshore area. In their 2007 report, North Danmarkshavn Salt Basin and the South Danmarkshavn Basin have been estimated to contain most of the undiscovered petroleum resources. But due to its remote location and often harsh climatic conditions, makes it difficult to navigate and explore. ‚Äú

        If not for those gas lines running through Ukraine, no one would care much about this corrupt backwater on the edge of Europe.
Maybe less important than energy but I thought the corrupt backwater was also important agriculturally, at least for Western Europe. Presumably, the agricultural output of Ukraine has been damaged by the war.

        Update: Zelenskyy‚Äôs diplomats arrived today to meet with Jolani‚Äôs HTS provisional government in Syria, after forwarding a gift of 500 tons of grain.
No question then, this is about the control of vital energy routes and regions.Remember, Libya got an oil bank one week after Gaddafi‚Äôs fall, even though they didn‚Äôt have a government. Neocons are applying pressure as a negotiating tactic.
I predict that Israel will propose itself as a superior guarantor of peace in the region than Iran; I can see a deal with Turkey and Russia, and the fall of Iran‚Äôs Shia Crescent proxies.
