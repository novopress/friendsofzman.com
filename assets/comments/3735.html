        What if small government just isn’t possible? The history of US Gov’t is one long example of mission creep. Sure, we might start out with a humble agency ensuring that no one is selling dangerous pills, but we’ll inevitably end up with something like the behemoth modern FDA.

        As the Moody Blues opined some years ago it is “A Question of Balance”.  Ah there’s the rub.

        I spend a lot of time thinking about governments, and despite the flaws, or system government is pretty good compared to the many alternatives

        Enforcing criminal laws is never left up to free markets, leprechauns or any other magical nonsense rattling around in the heads of libertarians. Selling falsely labeled products is always the concern of the state.
Similarly, companies defrauding the public is a concern of the state. If you claim that taking your product will raise the dead, as it were, it better raise the dead. Otherwise you should go to jail.

        Buyer beware is the best standard of regulation. If we have been separated from that state of mind it is because we have come to assume Uncle is on it. Bureaucrats are a despicable class of people, even lower than politicians. Now they are joined at the hip.

        If the LIEBURALS just let the FREE MARKET do its divine duty and sort itself out, this wouldn’t be an issue. I think you’ve really been reaching the last couple of posts with all this government is good crap. Please refer to Karl Denninger or Lew Rockwell if you want to get off this liberal fascism streak you’ve been on lately. ywia
