        I meet punks who have never heard of Subhumans, they are more interested in studded jackets and getting mad. I‚Äôve met bikers who sport the beard and tattoos but couldn‚Äôt change the tyre on their Harley. Surfers who haven‚Äôt seen the ocean since before iPods existed. They can‚Äôt wait to tell you about how good it is to be part of their sub-culture though. Most moonbatism is a fear of being left out and being the one guy at the bar who doesn‚Äôt suffer any cognitive dissonance over what they are saying. Just cling onto a group and fake your way to approval. I dare say low self-esteem humans have been doing for millennia.And once they are ‚Äúmembers‚Äù of the cult, they will not consider the opinions of those outside it.

        I always thought, with no concrete data to support my thought, that a significant portion of the people who do crazy things in a ‚Äúto search for themselves‚Äù were emulating bad plots in chick flicks. Hollywood strikes again.

            It‚Äôs probably the other way around or perhaps a self-reinforcing dynamic. Most writers are poor and a little nuts. They tend to hang around ‚Äúinteresting people‚Äù looking for material, but also because they just don‚Äôt fit in with suburban white-bread social groups. People write best about what they know so that begets a lot of interesting stories about fringe people on quests. It‚Äôs also why Hollywood loves movies about Hollywood.

        ‚ÄúYou can be sure that within five minutes of meeting this guy for the first time he will tell you he is an atheist.‚Äù  Reminds me of ‚Äù How can you tell if someone is a vegan? ‚ÄìDon‚Äôt worry, they will tell you.‚Äù   When discussing various topics with a moonbat I occasionally run into, I asked if he only got his information from MSNBC to which he exclaimed,  where else?  I was being sarcastic, he was being earnest.  We no longer discourse.

        I haven‚Äôt met too many doers in any discipline that trend towards moonbattery,exceptwhen they have suffered some great moral injury like Rawlings.  I knew a Korean War vet who‚Äôd been shot up pretty badly and had a doer‚Äôs ability to make things work, but had been a hemp-smoking beatnik and had no patience for God, traditional mores, or authority.I‚Äôd like to think that investing a great deal of effort in the present, just to see something work* in the future, requires a certain amount of faith and tends to make one realize that ‚Äúwe stand on the shoulders of giants.‚Äù* I mean work in the most elemental sense here: some process or mechanism that produces useful outputs given some defined inputs‚Ä¶ not a book or a speech at a conference.

            I noodled over that for a while this morning. On the one hand, I figured exactly no one would catch it. On the other, I love the use of it in this context. On the other other hand, it is not proper English, but this is a blog so it probably carries a short prison term.

                I spotted it immediately, but it worked on a couple of levels that it had to be deliberate and left alone. The exclamation mark after science is wonderful. This blog is coming into a special place all of its own.

        I am sure it has occurred to you too, but don‚Äôt you think there is enormous evidence that in many moonbats, there simply is no mind at all.

            I‚Äôm always tempted to say it is low-average-IQ at work. I‚Äôm not sure about that as I have known some very intelligent people who hold totally insane beliefs. When I was a kid I played chess with a rocket scientist from NASA. He was an excellent player. He also held two advanced degrees in right answer subjects, physics and math. My strategy to beat him at chess was to bring up Nixon. The guy would get so wound up over the topic he would make all sorts of mistakes and beating him was just a matter of waiting.My amateur theory is that belief, reason and self-awareness are not interdependent traits. That said, the people in my post are mediocre minds.
