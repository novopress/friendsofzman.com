        While it certainly seems like the Left has won, it is always darkest before the dawn, no?
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” — Winston Churchill
Many of us who still hew to conservative values and understand the superiority of Western thought and culture are feeling beaten and on the verge of despair. Maybe what this country needs is a good old fashioned Great(er) Depression to wake people up.

        The greatness that was Western Civilization was entirely Caucasian, and reached it’s apogee under Anglo-Saxon influence. “The English had progressed furthest of all people in three important things–piety, commerce and freedom.”-MontesquieuWe assume advances in civilization are natural because they provide for so much that is good, but not only is it not natural, advances are in every case anti-instinctual. The peculiar characteristics of unprecedented out-bred populations allowed for the advances of the Renaissance and still later English law. But a peculiar asset may well come with a peculiar liability, and that peculiar liability has now flipped it’s better half to the ground. The invisible hand is difficult to defend, being invisible. The Marxist will defend his positions appealing to instinct, which needs no understanding. He has no tribe but Marx and he believes he will control lesser tribes with his intellect.When a people feel the need to rediscover what ordered liberty is, it will not and cannot be a multi-cultural affair, which would leave America, as it now exists, out. A tribe that is inbred or unintelligent is not peculiar, it is natural. Even the Chinese, who have many personal assets, have little aptitude for liberty. Tocqueville–“When Europeans landed in China three hundred years ago, they found there that almost all the arts had reached a certain degree of perfection and were surprised that they had not improved beyond that point. It was an industrial nation where most scientific processes had been preserved, while science itself was dead. That explained the unusually static quality of mind of this nation. The Chinese, in following the path of their ancestors, had mislaid the reasons for the direction the latter had chosen. They still used the formula without asking why; they kept the tool but they had lost the skills to adapt or replace it. The Chinese were, therefore, not able to change anything and had to abandon any notion of improvement. The well of human knowledge had dried up and although the flow still ran, it could neither increase its volume nor change its course.We should not, therefore, complacently think that the barbarians are still far away for, if some nations allow the torch to be snatched from their hands, others stamp it out themselves.”

        Meanwhile, we still have to live in this world.  Dreher’s got the right idea, but it’s not likely many of us will be moving off to form religious communes in the wilderness.  Most of us will stay right where we are, and if we want to avoid being trampled by every leftist jackass that comes trotting down the street, we should try to think of ways of protecting ourselves.We might as well try using laws to our advantage, as long as its possible.  We’re now in a low-trust culture, so let’s start acting like it.  No more guileless Christian bakers smiling at every customer who walks in, and helpfully telling the nice homosexual couple that she can’t help them with their wedding cake inquiries, but there’s a very good bakery in the next street who’d be glad to.  That sort of innocent trust is over.  We now must realize that our society is full of people who mean to do us harm and are hunting for opportunities to do so.All Christian or conservative companies who are targets for leftist scalp-hunters now have to protect themselves with contracts for every transaction.  (It has to be EVERY transaction, because any attempt to restrict ONLY homos and other leftist troublemakers will leave one open to charges of (gasp!) discrimination.)  Every customer must sign a waiver, forfeiting all right to sue or take legal action in the event the seller welches on the deal.  This is unusual, but the response will be that the buyer will simply have to accept the word of a Christian that the goods will be delivered properly.  For fellow Christians, this will not be a problem.  For predatory leftists, they will suddenly find themselves with something to lose.  As a Christian, I would have no hesitation messing up a wedding cake I’ve been coerced into making.  It could just turn out bad, as often happens in baking, or the oven could just happen to conk out and there was nothing I could do.  The buyers would have to figure out just how much their “wedding” actually means to them, that they would be willing to take a risk that their showboating could backfire, and there would be no legal way of punishing me.And this tactic would be implemented for any vulnerable business.  It would then be in their interest to boldly advertise themselves as Christian companies that use “Trust Treaties” for all their business.  Their fellow religionists could support them, and their enemies would know there was nothing to gain from baiting them.

        All of this is a sign of the times we live in. Things are so damn good that we have nothing to fight for. No crime, no external enemies, nobody starves. That’s why the CML is picking the bones of conservatives. They have nothing left in the tank either. The next manoeuvres will be those of ridiculousness and hubris. They have never held power very well because they are cowards and idiots. What we await is the dollar to tank or the oil to start to dry up. When that panic sets in, the last thing we are going to worry about is gay men getting “married,” black “discrimination” or health “subsidies.” The church is going to have plenty of business too.  As UKer notes, that’s when people will get real again.

        I take your points, Z, but there is one thing that the elites and the progressives (or whatever they choose to call themselves) can never beat.People will remain people.For all the shouting of some and celebrating of their ‘friends’ and among all the demands for sacrificing symbols, deep down people will remain what they are. Not all of those beaming about ‘progress’ and the new world order actually like it as much as they pretend. Somewhere along the line they will say, quietly at first but possibly louder as they find more allies, that some things now worshipped are distasteful. They will curl their lip and regard the dancing monkeys as pitiful clowns.What people really are will surface again. It may be hard to see right now, but it will slowly change back from the pretend to the real.

                Thanks Z, your response took me back to when as a lad my father took me to an amateur film awards show in London and this movie was the only thing I can remember from that afternoon out. It was probably my ‘awakening’ to what movies were as storytelling devices. It made a big impact on me, so thanks again.

                    I’m surprised that film is not more popular today. It is pretty powerful stuff for a film. Kinda of cool that it is free on-line. Things are not all bad, I guess.

        In Erik the Red’s Saga, proud Pagans are sailing off to confront the unknown.  In the Greenland Saga, the few remaining Pagans have to sneak off to pay respects to the Norse Gods in secret.  That represents one or two generations, maximum.
On the other hand, the Maccabees faced an elite who had almost completely given themselves up to Greek paganism and their Greek masters.  They won.

        I disagree. The “Old Right” was as pathetic as the current bunch, if not more so. WFB was a trust fund dilletante. Russell Kirk was a silly fool. “Conservatism” just is not and never has been a meaningful response to the problems of the times.
