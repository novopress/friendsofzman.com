        Not exactly on the topic of this thread, but:
“…the press… are too stupid to understand it”
I’ve felt this for a long time- most members of the working press are ignoramuses.  (ignnorami?) What’s worse is that most of them think they are really smart. Bad combo!

        We have much the same thing here. Once our borders were opened wide (and at the same time the number of customs officials reduced) then the UK government swiftly lost track of how many people were arriving and even worse, how many were staying without any proper documentation. Every estimate prepared by Whitehall turned out to be wildly inaccurate: where they said ‘no more than 10,000’ it turned out to be ten times that at least, and even then that was only the ones they knew about.Better still, some of the illegals who stayed beyond their visas — often student visas — got to work for UK government offices. I know of one such case, and it impacted badly on the government career of a man who (innocently) married the illegal immigrant.But here’s a true story, relayed to me by a man who had dealings with the British army. A private turned up at his commanding officer’s desk while stationed in Germany and said he wanted to change his name. The CO sighed and said, if you must, then bring in your passport and we will get the forms organised. Oh, and you are married aren’t you? Yes sir, said the squaddie. “Well, better bring in her passport too.”“She hasn’t got one,” said the soldier. “She came on an RAF transport when I was posted here, so no passport check.” The CO nodded wearily, and asks for the birth certificate of the private’s wife.“She hasn’t got one,” said the soldier. “She was born on a ship and smuggled into the UK as a baby. She never went to school, never had a job legally, never paid any taxes. No one knows she exists. I met her and we got married, so that’s why she’s here with me.”The expletives issued by the CO are not recorded, but here is one hell of a problem that needed sorting out.I admit this is just one instance, but as far as people are beginning to discover in the UK, this is just one of many, many cases, and they all add up to a terrifying number. I recall a man on the radio, here legally, who phoned in to say he had told the immigration people that at least five of his ‘cousins’ were here illegally but as he could only provide names but not addresses of where they were in the UK it turned out they weren’t interested.Still, that’s five more that won’t be added to any official statistics. And the political parties wonder why we don’t want to vote for those who ‘oversaw’ all this incompetence and wilful neglect.

        What if there’s some kind of terrorist attack that is traced to border crossers?  There are all these stories about Border Patrol being forced to lie and report all crossers as being of Mexican origin when they might be Somalies or Arabs.

        Bush will collude with Boehner and McConnell to pass an amnesty of some sort.  So will Walker, Cruz, Jindal, Santorum, Christie, Huckabee, or Paul.I’ve spent most of the day at Hot Air pointing out to the Cruz Cultists that the Manchurian Conservative’s position on immigration is the same as Walker’s current “evolved” position, which is legalization without citizenship, along with a massive increase in legal immigration (including from Mexico, as if we need one more Mexican in this country) and H-1B1 visas, and that this has been Cruz’s stated position since 2013.  Now Cruz’s office has issued a statement confirming his continued adherence to his 2013 position and they still don’t believe it.  Heads are exploding!
