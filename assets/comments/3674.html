        Yes, the countless ads have become super annoying. I don’t think it’s to any site’s benefit, either. If a site has a couple ads, it doesn’t bother most people. Once you reach a certain ratio of ads to content, and I have no idea what that ratio is, you become overwhelmed by the ads and either screen them out or choose not to visit that site. I’ve had to stop visiting certain sites that used to be faves, because of the uptick in ads. I’m usually on my ipad when I’m online, so I’m not usually assaulted by the embedded audio ads, but all that extra “stuff” seriously slows my scrolling down. Frustrating.Unfortunately, I think the future of ads might look similar to what was in the movie “Minority Report”. People would walk into stores and a hologram would pop-up in front of them, address them by name, and begin a sales pitch. Just one more reason not to shop.

        I concur, there are sites I will not visit because of the obnoxious advertising.  I also will not pay to view either. There is more than enough free content out there to keep me busy as well as sites that are moderate in their advertising.  As always, “the best things in life are free.”

        If Apple (or anyone else) would ever solve the problem of digital micro payments, I think most websites will go to a subscription/a la carte pay model.
For instance if I had to pay three cents to read a story, but all I had to do was hit one button so my account was securely debited, then I’m there. Especially if I know there’ll be no ads.
I think that’s the way it’s going to have to go eventually, because the ad-based model is horrible for everyone involved.

        Football (or soccer) has had ads in the shape of ‘sponsor’ logos on their shirts/uniforms for years and most of them are so trivial or vague there is no danger of even the remotest sell except to perhaps the odd, utterly deranged fan. When it turns out the ‘sponsor’ is a town council — and what an utter wate of tax money that is — the so-called sales message is even more useless.A long time before the BBC became the lefty- loony club they loved showing horse jumping as it was safely middle class and satisfied the Brirish need for caring about animals (in the same period it showed a weekly sheepdog- rounding- up- sheep competition) and was thus inoffensive to all. The BBC at that time however was a hotbed even then of hypocrisy. They fumed about showing football with a sponsors logo on the shirts, particularly one of the first who wove a car maker’s logo shape into their shirt design (it was a large T shape) lest it sullied the pure non-commercial stance of the national broadcaster. At the same time horse-jumping hit on the idea of earning money by naming horses not as Daisy or Samson but as a commercial product. The BBC chose not to notice apparently and would enthusiastically show and repeatedly name ‘Everest Double Glazing’ jumping over fences.The double-glazing company got free national advertising and the car manufacturer’s not-so-obvious T shape about to be obscured in mud offended the high and mighty Beeb. And people wonder why I dislike them so much…

            I primarily use Mozilla as I have it configured with all my stuff. On it I use an array of ad blockers, script blockers and flash block. Flash block is a godsend. Chrome is stock and I rarely use it.
