        I think you’re missing an important factor: a great deal of the erosion in church attendance and religious self-identification is driven by the increasing influence of progressive philosophy within the churches. In other words, a significant fraction of those “leaving church” are not defecting to modern secularism, but fleeing it. Christian churches which continue to be true to their ancient traditions are doing fine; it’s the ones that offer nothing other than progressive politics and some useless atavistic ritual that are emptying out.Plus, we have no way of knowing the reality behind the poll that produced that chart. Over time, the way people interpret the question could have changed — if it was, indeed, even the same question. Or, the method of choosing the sample might have changed. Or it could be fake. Who knows?My own guess is that once the present generation of leftist apostates dies off, Christianity will experience a resurgence — unless some other factor enters the equation to change things. I admit, though: it’s only a guess.

            I think MtnExile’s first paragraph nails it, many mainstream Christian churches have left Christanity by the side of the road.  I could see the future Evangelicals going underground, worshiping without the buildings and infrastructure that will have been confiscated and prohibited.  Meanwhile, the “mainstream” Protestants and the Catholics will continue to be co-opted by the Progressives, and will minister to empty sanctuaries and serve functionally non-existent congregations.

        The referenced chart is for religious affiliation. That indicates … What? One must “belong” to a denomination in order to be a believer? That is rather old-fashioned thinking. One must be Christian, Jewish or Muslim and then Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Reform, Liberal, Karaite, Shia, Sunni and then Baptist, Methodist, Church of God in Christ, African Methodist Episcopalian, Roman, Russian, Greek, Georgian, Armenian, and etc. and etc.?

        I will second Eris Guy and thank Z-man for this.  I will put it in my kit bag along with Julian and the Icelandic sagas.
Pope Benedict thought that the church might retreat to enclaves to spring forth again when the time was right.  Based on what I know about the fossil churches of the Levant and Mesopotamia, I thought him wrong.  Recent events in Syria and Iraq seem to prove me right.   Neither Salafists nor Progressives will allow religious enclaves to persist.

        I usually use the life of Julian as an example. I didn’t know of this example. Thanks.When Julian sent funds to the pagan temples to re-establish tradition and worship, the money was wasted on frivolities, which is what I see at worship in Methodist churches.I don’t think modern paganism can endure. Apostates in the 1960s turned to every real and crackpot religion after abandoning Christianity. That need cannot be satisfied by yoga, Jim Jones or Marshall Applewhite or Louis Farrakhan, Hinduism, or Buddhism. Islam will triumph, unless a new god appears.(Certainly if Moslem invaders were to appear, like descendants of the Romans ruled by the Vandals in Spain, I would stand aside to watch the slaughter.)If you have a different opinion, I look forward to your essay.Unlike other religions, Christianity can be proved false. God has a covenant with the Jews. If the Jews are destroyed, Christianity is false; pagans know it and hate Jews.

            There’s some debate in science as to whether belief in the supernatural is biological. Belief seems to have co-evolved with religion, suggesting they are related. Religion, even the crude animism of hunter gatherers was a remarkably good way to store information to be passed from one generation to the next. My sense is people will in the main continue to believe in God and maintain ritual practices related to the supernatural. Christianity evolved over 2,000 years and continues to evolve so maybe everyone will be Mormons in a couple of generations.

            ErisGuy:  “Unlike other religions, Christianity can be proved false. God has a covenant with the Jews. If the Jews are destroyed, Christianity is false; pagans know it and hate Jews.”
Oh dear! How juvenile. Pity about that pesky ickle  two letter word “if” isn’t it…!
The Jews haven’t been destroyed (despite many determined attempts). So therefore….

        Thanks for the history lesson. Living in the UK (and pretty much on the borders of Northumbria and Mercia) I feel a certain kinship with those times, which I maintain were not quite as uncivilised as we may pretend now. But, the rulers knew what was required to hold power and no one — openly at least — cared about ‘public opinion’ and media was what you were told or heard, not what you read.But I don’t quite buy the end of Christianity. It will change, true, but some truths run deep. Much deeper than the lefties would believe. As for the gay marriage issue and their ‘triumph’ it carefully ignores the pressing matter of our muslim friends, who seem to dislike the idea even if they are just as likely to secretly participate in the acts. It is one thing to bash the followers of Christ with demanding we all love gay marriage, but while Iran and the Saudis still execute homosexuals, making the christians in the west bow down to the new ways is a bit like picking low hanging fruit. As we import more and more of islam with their barbaric customs, it will be interesting to see how the’ love gays or else’ campaign will fare.

        Will be really hard to get rid of the “religions of the book” because they have powerful writtings, institutions and history behind them.
Professor Revilo P. Oliver wrote that if the Elite wanted to get rid of Christianity they could do it by just using their Media control but the truth is that Christianity still is useful for the Elite, especially modern Evangelical Christianity.

        I believe that many people believe that is what is happening. But Christ’s Church will never pass away. If these neo-pagans have their run, they have their run, but they will eventually be enslaved, either to passions or the more powerful. And they will seek freedom, the freedom that can only come from Christ. If they fail to turn to Christ, they will be enslaved by Islam.In other words, Christianity is not just a religion among religions. It is the truth, as silly as that sounds to you, and thus it it the New Religion that will break upon the Rock. Atheist’s children become neo-pagans, and their children are either reconverted or become Muslims.

            It does not sound silly. I hope you are correct. I’m not optimistic. My whole life the Progressives have been trying to turn out the lights on civilization. They seem to be winning.

        Wrong, Buddy. The X-factor in Christianity is God. He’s not a myth or an archetype. He lives and has a voice in history. The idols of sodomy and all the other cute little isms are lifeless and tend to produce Barbarians and buffoons. They don’t own the future. They’re a blip in the big picture.
