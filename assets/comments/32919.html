        Rufo’s article is classic colorblind CivNat hypocrisy. In the article, Rufo rails against both identity politics and anti-Semitism and, of course, for a colorblind, individualistic society. Yet, he’s too dense to notice that Jews are the best argument for identity politics and against colorblind civic nationalism.First, Jews work as a team. They are the ultimate players of identity politics. Second, they’ve been wildly successful working as a team, which proves that other groups that follow a colorblind, individualistic policy will get steamrolled. The past 60 years have one victory after another for identity politics in general and Jewish efforts specifically.Rufo – and others like him, such as Sailer and Charles Murray – should be pointing out Jewish groups as the biggest danger to colorblind civic nationalism, but, instead, they either keep quiet or praise the Jewish community for its success.When does Rufo or Sailer or Murray discuss the power of AIPAC or Jewish donors or them using their power to promote Jewish interesting and the Jewish community? Never.You can’t promote colorblind civic nationalism and be fine with Jews working as a team to promote their interests and their community. Rufo, Sailer and Murray are sell-outs and liars, plain and simple.

The Upton Sinclair quote has become a cliche for a reason.

            I only briefly scanned the top half of his article and his whole tone of “what’s this obsession with jews” in an article obsessing over jews is an irony lost on him (contra to Z’s opinion, I don’t think very highly of Rufo’s intellect).

                Agreed. The Rufo article engages in both-sides-ism, but we fully realize the target audience is only one side. The previous version was “that’s not who we are!” I gave Rufo the benefit of a doubt until recently, and this piece distills why he didn’t deserve it.

                    Yeah, there is always that little hall monitor peering out over the words in the article like he’s looking over the neighbor’s fence making sure nothing untoward is going on.  Ready to take down notes and report.  That is the case with al of these guys, Rufo, Shapiro.  They call them gatekeepers for a reason I guess.

                Rufo is stunningly dense, at least in his writing. This article focuses on Left and Right-wing issues with Jews, so you might think he would, you know, discuss the Jewish community and how crazy these issues are. Nope.He rails against “left-wing identity politics” while never acknowledging that no group comes close to employing identity politics, via donors and endless Jewish groups and lobbies, than Jews. You can’t beagainstidentity politics andforJews using (with wild success) identity politics.He then rails against right-wing conspiracy theories about Jewish power. (They love to use the word conspiracy to marginalize anyone questioning Jewish influence.) Rufo seems to have never heard of AIPAC or the make-up of the Biden Administration or US policy toward Israel or the top political donors, etc., etc.A high schooler can demolish this article, but Rufo lives in a protected bubble paid for by guess who so he’ll never be faced with that humiliation.

                    I know little of Rufo, but in fairness, any person, no matter how great his education or native intelligence, will quickly get stuck in logical or rhetorical quicksand if he’s trying to argue from invalid premises and/or towards a logically incoherent goal. When otherwise smart people are saying stupid shit, it’s a reasonable guess that the Sinclair quote is operative.

            This is material for an entire essay, one which I hope Zman will do someday. Having spent my entire career in finance and consulting, I have a lot of thoughts on the topic. I have told my Jewish friends that their desire for hegemony here is going to backfire in a major way. The smarter ones understand it, because they realize they cannot manage a coalition of minorities forever. However, the midwits think they can corral and beat rent out of third-world savages indefinitely.

                Correct.
This is most evident in their desperate attempts to keep the WW2 myths alive because they are realizing no one under 45 has any reason to care, even less so in the case of their vibrant young pets.

            “Jews work as a team.”
I don’t think that’s true. Big Jews work as a team, sort of. There are at least two distinct teams of Big Jews.
Big Jews don’t care about Little Jews. Never have, or the shtetls wouldn’t have been enclaves of the Little Jews, while the Big Jews lived and ran their mercantiles in Goyland.

                So what. Big Jews will still always view Little Jews as part of their team, if lessor members. And they will always view me as nothing, indeed, as a threat.
You’re making the who would you rather live next to, Thomas Sowell or a violent redneck argument. It’s too late for that. Time to tribe up or die.
Fine, Jewish elites play as a team. So what. They’re still playing as team with their people’s interests at heart and they’re still coming after yours truly.

                    Little Jews are pawns, like everyone else who is not Big Jew.
“You’re making the who would you rather live next to”
Just pointing out they are not the monolithic threat you believe them to be. Unite them in a common cause at your peril.
“They’re still playing as team with their people’s interests at heart and they’re still coming after yours truly.”
True, though if there were whites with half a clue, they would pit Jew against Jew, instead of doing what Israel has done with Sunni and Shia — unite them.

                            Little Jews are their pawns because tactically inept Whites have united them against Goy. Possibly even stupid Whites who listened to Big Jew advisors.
Flyover Whites take pride in opposing our Elites. There’s got to be a way to turn their Littles against their Elites. But that is not going to happen by treating them all as a hated enemy. It’s got to be finding some common cause with them in opposing the managerial class.

                                I do not think that is ever going to happen, splitting the Bigs from the LittlesThey are a team united by blood, and every group has a similar hierarchy.  The Little Jews look up to the Bigs in a big way too.  I have known regular stupid Jews, I forget the name but it would be similar to an Englishman referring to himself as a bloke.  Just a regular guy.  But ask him how he feels about the Royal Family and he immediately is in fight mode should anyone dare say anything negative.  I know a toothless guy from Manchester, for example, a good guy but just a bloke, paints houses, and he can tell you to the year everything that has ever happened amongst the Royals, how the line of succession works, etc.The Little Jews I am certain have similar adulation for their own version of royalty, be it Spielberg or whomever.We are never going to split them up.  What we can do, which is happening big time on X for example, is mock them mercilessly.  They are being exposed for the shits they are.Maybe the internet today is the medium that white people use to take down the Jews in the same way the Jews used Hollywood movies to take down the WASP ruling elite and paint them as heartless oil baron monsters or whatever the case may be.Now I know I may also sound heartless, but my guess is I speak for many people.  The atrocities in Palestine, in Lebanon, the dead babies, they honestly have not moved me to a great degree.  Maybe I am out of “fukks” to give about people not my own, but BUT the Israelis are now bombing the hell out of the ancient city of Tyre.  And this is really starting to piss me off.  Who do they think they are?  Bombing world heritage sites?  All the artifacts and so forth?  It’s shit like this that is going to start pissing off YT.  If my reaction is anything to go by.

                                    OK, let’s say all that is true. The question then is how can Whites accomplish that, too? We still have the numbers, though almost all are squishes or worse. How can some form of tribal identity (which is novel, BTW — pre-modern Europe was always at war with each other) be developed in Whites? Heck, even blacks can figure out how to vote in &gt;90% solidarity, despite their ancestors being enemies for millenia.

                        They’re not monolithic, but they’re still a team and a team that has declared war on my team. Did the Japanese all agree on everything during WWII. No. But they were still loyal to their side.Instead of getting into the weeds – which, btw, is a very classic Jewish argument technique – let’s simply look at what Jews do in literally every society that is stupid enough to let them in.They immediately form Jewish groups that work to promote Jewish interests. They work to get control of financial, media and political influence. They push for multi-everything societies because they feel safest in those societies. I could go on but you get the picture.Just as everywhere that blacks go, you find violence, everywhere where Jews are allows free rein, you get subversion. Whether its Big Jews or Little Jews or some Jews or lots of Jews, you get the same thing.I don’t care what each and every Jew is like individually. I care what they’re like as a group – and it’s clear as day. And if you think that whites are going to pit them against each other, good luck.

                Oh please.  Just like every other self-aware racial and ethnic group, both your “Big Jews” and “Little Jews” are mutually dependent and the sea in which they all swim. They lived together – apart and separate from the native society of whatever nation they temporarily inhabited – until the “Jewish emancipation” of the late 18th and mid 19th centuries.  This was essentially a mutual agreement:  The Jews insisted they were special and morally superior and genetically distinct, and the European natives said “You are not part of our people and history and don’t share our culture, lives, or interests.”Your “Big Jews” may make more money or wield more political power, but in any conflict with with non-Jews your “Little Jews” will always side with your “Big Jews.”  File your fiction along with the myth of the “majority of immigrants are good, hard working people” and all the supposedly peaceful and productive blacks.

                    There’s another dynamic here: in-group and out-group are not fixed. Sure, Big Jew and Little Jew will play on the same team, but what was left unsaid is that’ll likely remain true only as long as Team Jew is playing against Team Goyim. Tribal unity works until it doesn’t. There always have been struggleswithina tribe for dominance, as Abel’s blood would readily attest.

And that’s the important thing that “our” side refuses to even try to understand, because the Jew hatred is that intense. HOW is that unity accomplished? Our measly fraction of the population does not stand a chance unless we emulate that kind of clan loyalty. I’m not saying to create a cargo cult. I’m saying the smart play is to figure out the principles behind it, reverse-engineer it, and put those principles into practice.
Or just say screw future white generations. Your call.

I also agree that we should emulate Jews in terms of operating in a larger society. Form ethnic organizations that promote our people and punish those who work against our people.
Jews aren’t evil or magical. They just play the game well. That’s fine. Time for whites to join the game as well.

                            OK, but preaching the the choir accomplishes exactly nothing. Unless we can figure out a way to make our own Little Whites, politeness demands telling the losers (us), “GGWP.”
Personally, I’m not a big fan of losing well…

                    Back in my day, it was commercials trying to get Christians to part with their money to feed and/or import Africans, SE Asians, etc. Pushed by prominent Jews like Sally Struthers and Jane Fonda.
There really is nothing new. Whites have been suckers for stuff like that for at least a few centuries. The problem is not the ones advertising for the extinction of White society, but of Whites who buy. The answer has to be in figuring what is wrong with Whitey that so many crave death.

                    We can work with Jews, but we shouldn’t allow them into our camp or on our team. Sorry, but we’re Team Whitey. Jews are Team Jew. They’re a different tribe. We’ve seen what happens when you let them into your system. It’s not good.Working with members of Team Jew with the explicit understanding that we will never be a part of their team and they’ll never be a part of ours is just fine. But you make that fundamental understanding very, very clear from the beginning. After that, sure, if our interests are the same on an issue, let’s work together.

            Age is a factor in all this stuff C. If you are over 50 years old you were indoctrinated from childhood to drink the koolaid, and that it was good. Trust the institutions, trust the experts and things will go well for you. Jews and blacks were just like us, blah blah blah blah…Dissidence is a journey. 10 years ago I thought I was going nuts because the world my shitlib boomer family lived in didn’t match up at all with what I was seeing and my lived experience. There are no blacks or jews where I live so the narrative of oppressed minorities and greatest allies was an easy sell. My family was insulated by geography, money and the community from reality.To get to an understanding of reality there are any number of road blocks. You first have to get past the Orca Winfrey’s, Geraldo, Donahue and the other fixtures of the shitlib media. Then you have to get past their paid fart suckers – the Ben Shapiro’s, the Jordan Petersen’s, the Dave Rubin types. THEN – you have to get past the clowns and faggots like the Milo’s, Vox Day, Richard Spencer types.People forget that folks on this side of the great divide have to often get mugged by reality too. I will be really interested in seeing how Rufo sounds five years from now. The only reason I made it here is that the Dissidents took time to explain things to me and help me see past the crap I’d been born into. Dissidents are their own worst enemies. Rufo and his ilk would never have spoken the way they do five years ago. Looked at another way… Dissidence is going mainstream.People need to sit down with guys like that and TALK to them. Changing minds is not easy or fast.

                Agree that many of our ideas are going mainstream. The journey will be much shorter young people today. They’ll start many steps ahead. But they’ll still need to get through the colorblind CivNat gatekeepers like Rufo.
As to Rufo in five years, he’ll be the same. He’s similar to Steve Sailer and Charles Murray. He’ll stay right where he is.

                Not to quibble, but I am 57 and that was never part of my education and life.  My grandmother was openly critical of Jews, and I’d be buying us all dinner if I had a dollar for every time she spoke the words “those Jew bastards”In our school my brother’s best friend had a Nazi uniform from his uncle who had served under Hitler.  Not a single person ever made a peep about it. In fact I think he brought it to school as part of Show and Tell.  In school it was openly discussed that the reason the Germans had it in for the jews was b/c of WWI and how the Germans were sent out to die but the Jews were allowed to stay back and keep making money and mess with the women.EVERYONE made Jew jokes.My daughter’s class was the same thing.  And she graduated like 10 years ago, but all of her classmates ragged on Jews all the time.  And what is funny is this was in Los Angeles at a prep school so you know all of those white people who worked for some media company where they had to kiss Jew ass went home and in private badmouthed the Jews to the point where their children would bring up those topics in school among their peers.My sense of this all is that the Jew ass kissers are an online phenomenon.  No one IRL buys into that shit.  They just keep mum about it.  It’s not as if their memories were all erased of all those Jew jokes they told and heard in school.

                    Couldn’t help but laugh when I saw your grandmother’s remark. My father’s (I’m 78) version of it was “Never forget ‘jewbastid’ isoneword!” Fist slams down on arm of club chair. “ONE WORD!!” He was also fond of saying that Chanukah was invented in 1947 as an also-ran counterpoint to Christmas. Those were the days of the “Gentlemen’s Agreement” when good prep schools didn’t even have tokens and the Ivy League colleges were still tweed jacket territory with socially shunned token “semites”. Yacht clubs? Ah hahaha! Long gone now, but still nostalgically not forgotten. Not all Boomers bought the poisoned matzoh ball.

In their own cultures and lands, have at it, create what they want.Just let me and my descendants do the same.They insist on not doing that, and to live in my culture and lands and in many instances harm me and my descendants , therefore we must find a way to seperate lest both my culture and theirs be destroyed.Until a large portion of whites start to think this way we will continue down the path of perdition.

            Problem is, your race will have stuff that the others won’t and there are lots of them and they will try to get that stuff. How do you stop them?

        Shorter version: the Global American Empire fully embraces white genocide.Option 1: A color-blind society that slowly erases white people.Option 2: An anti-white society that rapidly erases white people.The Tribe thought it could transition from the first to the second option and escape the carnage and consequences. Now that it sees it cannot, it reverts to Option 1. Christopher Rufo, like Douglas Murray, Jordan Petersen, and so forth, has been tagged to play Pied Piper to facilitate the reversion. Good luck with that. Cucks will mouth the slogans but too many have the bared fangs seared into their memories. The future is now in the hands of young white men who came of age with that image.

                        Yes, Leftists love to use “our.” Much like certain Russian commies adopted the term “Bolsheviki” (Majority Men) despite the fact that they were actually a minority within Russian communism, to create the illusion of preponderence, our lovely Leftists use “our” to create the picture of an exclusive club of the righteous besieged by evil, dissenting subversives. Our Democracy, Our Society–this wonderful club they persist in calling America belongs to them, and we Traditionalists are bent on wrecking that holy thing.

            There’s a reason that Steve Sailer was let out of the shadows following the Oct. 7 attack and subsequent protests. All of the sudden, colorblind civic nationalism was “good for the Jews,” so anyone promoting it was pushed front and center.
Hilariously, Sailer thinks that his ideas finally won everyone over. What a rube.

                    It’s specific enough to be called Sailer’s Delusion: “I’msecretly influential on everybody except for the failures and crazies who actually acknowledge me.”He has been influential.The default dissident media personality’s attitude now, exemplified most flamboyantly by Fuentes, is “Everyone but me and globohomo is a loser.” That didn’t come from Pat Buchanan.I’ve always associatedidentification with mediawith gay men. Wholovesthe TV people? Who talks like they’re one of them in everyday life?Sailer—”spiritually gay,” as the girls say—brought that attitude to the man’s man’s world of the right. His postings at Ron’s place are like an old queen doing hisdivaact at the local hardware store.

        Color-blind sounds nice, but its wildly unrealistic.  Good whites need to realize,theymay pretend to be color-blind, but the blacks, browns, and yellows are, in fact, color-obsessed.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.Color-blindness was a luxury for a majority white country;  One could pretend to be color-blind, back in the day, because it wasn’t often that one’s prejudices were confirmed because there was not a great deal of interaction with blacks, or browns, or yellows.Now-a-days, our prejudices are confirmed daily, by incompetent blacks, incompetent and weasely pajeets, and competent but selfish yellows.  Oh –  and by the relief one feels when dealing with a white person, on the phone, or in the store, or on the job.

Exactly.  I still remember those days in the place of my birth, NYC.  The system (segregation) worked quite well as compared to today’s “improvement”—at least for Whites.  For the parasite races,  it so much as it made “feeding” more difficult.

        The corporations now are openly embracing — and even publicizing — a No Need to Apply policy concerning white males, and for decades have excluded white males from hiring and advancement.  What’s that tell us?It tells us that the Prog Religion that long ago conquered the country is, chiefly, a two-pronged attack: first, degrade and exclude males.  This is the feminist pogrom that’s been in ascendency for half-a-decade now.  Second, fine-tune the feminist position by including whites in the satanic equation.To be sure, white WOMEN are still very much being embraced (and hired) by the corporations.  They rule the schools and colleges, the media, the courts, and even the churches.  So the attack is not strictly racial in nature, otherwise white women would be refused and denigrated the same way that white men are.  Quite the contrary, white women are the supreme caste in Progressive Amerika; their word is, quite literally now, the Law.If the pogrom truly was just racial in nature, you’d see white females being scorned, excluded and attacked the same way that white men are.  But that simply has not happened during the past 50 years of the Progressive Politburo.

            I’m not sure if ironic is the right word or not, but it’s certainly remarkable that there are no more eager and rigid enforcers of the pro dieversity, anti white male system than AWFLs.

                They are the core constituency and the lead enforcers of DEI and, before that, AA.  The AWFLs were paid off in careers, and also via the awarding of cultural and legal power over males, but particularly white males.
They make an accusation against you, the sheriff’s cars pull up at your doorstep in 15 minutes, demanding an explanation for whatever accusation they made up.  You make an accusation against them, you are laughed at.  That is POWER.
The Awfuls are the heart and soul of the Democratic Party, and of Leftism in general.  America’s enemy is within.

            “White males need not apply” probably works OK in a non-technical bullshi* business and among the suits. But any technical business will decline in inverse relation to the number of white males in the workforce. Find a black CNC programmer, or a brown one who can actually put out working code when needed.

                They don’t care if the business declines.  That is a PLUS.  They openly state that their agenda is to destroy (what is left of) Traditional America, so they can Build Back Better.
Woke means broke?  That is a positive result to them.  Other countries watch this and their reaction is to de-value the dollar.  Again.  Decline and destruction is the point.

                Yep.  Last week two women ‘pilots’ flew their bazillion-dollar fancy-radar Growler jet into the side of Mt. Rainier.  Soon they’ll be at the helm of your next domestic flight.  Happy landings!Two weeks ago a female ‘captain’ of a NZ ship ran it aground and sank it.  Etc. and etc.Meanwhile, all our nations are shoe-horning females into military slots for which they are not qualified, just as fast as they can.  Hell, they can’t even pass the physical exercise requirements in their basic training units.  So of course, the requirements are changed.  Because requirements and standards are misogynistic, doncha know.White men, btw, are fleeing from the Woke military.  The white sergeants and NCOs with years in-grade — and crucial years of experience — are not re-upping, but instead bailing.  Gee wonder why?

            I’m a bit late to the party, but white women are valued in the current society because women tend to emote rather than think. And when their delusions bear bad fruit, they can be counted on to berate the white men who warned them what would happen. IKAGO and all that, but as with most stereotypes, there’s usually a reason behind them.
No matter which head white men think with, they arrive at wrongthink. Even though that kind of wrongthink resulted in the prosperous society we have, and they want.

        Of course, the origin of all this madness is the magical negro.  And it’s all just devolving into a racial spoils system now that proverbial “melting pot” is super duper sized.

                I wasn’t blaming the MN, although there’s plenty to blame them for – of course that trope was (and still is) created and promoted by certain, lighter skinned people.  Just pointing out that the dreaded racism BS has always been about black/White and nothing else.  And too many Whites bought in – either enthusiastically or apathetically and allowed it to morph into the monster we have now.  All the other flavors of mud are just glomming on due to the easy pickings.

                We’re dealing with social and political issues here, but during my Literature studies we briefly studied folk stories, myths, etc. Not surprisingly, there are certain types of narrative structure that have persisted across many cultures and thousands of years. For example, the “Hero’s Journey.” Specialists study this stuff. There is a database of several hundred story formulae and one of them is…. wait for it…”The Magical Negro.” The example I recall from class is Stephen King’sThe Green Mile. Of course in the folk tale the character is pure fantasy. Magic healing powers don’t exist. Exceptionally good Negroes really do occur in the real world (e.g. Sowell) but they still border on the non-existent.

        Z seems to be forgetting the Steve Sailers and Charles Murrays of the world. They accept racial differences but still push for a colorblind society, acknowledging that it will lead to unequal results for various groups but, presumably, equal results for individuals.
They are both racist and anti-racists. (I’d argue that they’re also naive, childish and disloyal but that’s a different debate.)

            The obvious counter to this is that groups of people behave in predictable ways, and get more predictable the larger the group is. You put a bunch of white men together and they produce excellence, put a bunch of black men together and they produce detroit.
forcing these predictable harms onto people is evil.

            I’d argue that they are products of a time when you could separate public policy from private behavior. For example, keeping the races separate in prison is reasonable, as it limits violence. Keeping the races separate on public transit is wrong because it forces people to judge one another by race. For them, public policy is solely about the practical ends of society. Ethics are about how you as an individual interact with your fellows.Rufo conflates public policy with personal ethics. If it is immoral to notice race individually, then it must be immoral to do so as a matter of public policy and if it is immoral as a matter of policy, then it is immoral individually. Where Sailer and Murray separate the public and private, Rufo conflates them into a totalitarian colorblind ideology.

                Agree. It’s an important distinction between Sailer/Murray and Rufo.Indeed, I remember that Sailer often mentioned that he was seeking practical solutions to society’s problem. Of course, Sailer never seemed to notice that his oh-so-practical solution of colorblind civic nationalism has been on a 60-year losing streak, something that would make a practical man re-evaluate their position.Rufo just seems very shallow.Regardless, what binds all three is a desire to remain a part of the commentariat wing of the managerial class. I doubt that Murray or maybe even Sailer need the money but losing that status would kill them. As such, they’ll force themselves to not notice some obvious flaws in the policy.

                So why can one no longer separate private morality with public policy? Jurisprudence, yes, to some extent, but Brown was not the expansive ruling people make it out to be.
What is it about today’s people that there’s this unquestionable belief that there should be a public policy? My great-grandfather left Norway largely because Norway had swallowed the public policy poison. Norway was a great place to be FROM. But anymore, even Libertarians argue about not whether DC should be bossing us around, but merely how much.

                    I would argue that Brown was far more expansive than most understand. It created a new moral framework within the law. The ultimate good was the open society, which meant the ultimate bad was any barriers within society. Quickly all private association came under scrutiny. Any barrier to entry to anything that could be defined as a public space, which was everything outside the home, was assumed invalid be default. The establishment of a barrier needed to pass the high bar of the Brown Test.In other words, Brown replaced the purpose of the old order, the preservation of individual liberty balanced against the preservation of society, with a new purpose, the creation of the open society. It was a radical transformation of American society rivaling the Bolshevik Revolution.

                        It is far too generous to think BROWN was decided for neutral utopian purposes*, but even if that was the motivation, it quickly degenerated into a punitive decision. Only one race and one group were required to be “open” by the cases that followed, notably SWANN that required white students to be uprooted from their neighborhood schools and bussed across town to bask in the glow of Negroes. SWANN only was curtailed after blacks complained about the inconvenience. Only one group ever has been denied freedom of association.*BROWN actually was just another battle in the Forever War against the South, but for the sake of argument is presented here as legitimate legal reasoning. The justices who decided BROWN never imagined they would have to live in integrated neighborhoods save for the very rare exception of a Justice Thurgood Marshall.

                        And, yet, that attack on freedom of association seems very targeted. The open society morality doesn’t apply endless black, Hispanic, Jewish or women’s groups. Indeed, they are promoted.
What was attacked was whites having associations that excluded others.

                        This is probably the only thing I credit to economics—to capitalism.To depress wages and generally immiserate the citizenry, to eliminate the middle class family and the freedom and aspiration it breeds, women must work, must beemployed. So a hundred million American girls need jobs, but they can’t really do anything except “woman’s work.” We have to alienate them from all that,lest they remember, so for that we’ll import slave races, Chinese to launder, Ukrainians to whore,miscellaneousto nurse, etc. What’s left to our women? The typing pool can only get so big, and we can only keep them in school for so long… The smartest guy in the room remembers his Orwell:Women are commissars.But this is America. Commissars ofwhat? Well, thisisAmerica, so the answer must be found in the military. What’s theirtheory of everythingthese days? “Diversity?! What the hell is that?”There wasn’t a meeting or even a decision. The pieces fell into place, as in retrospect they always do. A plan emerged, already almost accomplished. The Civil Rights Act got your wife out of the house.

                            Women entering the workforce en masse destroyed the nuclear (male-led) family.  A BIG win for The State and its elites (banksters, moneyed families et al.)Now everywhere you look — especially in government and large corporations — girlbosses rule, swaggering about in pantsuits and padded shoulders.  Hillary Clinton clones after sixty years of AA.  This alienates and dis-spirits the male, especially the white male, who has been the specific target of the Progressive Politburo for many decades now.Clearly, the PTB don’t want family formation — they want everyone to rely on The State, and for females to replace husbands with The State, a goal already largely accomplished.  But the PTB also don’t want white-male hegemony of any type, meaning the PTB fear white-male hegemony as, really, the only viable threat to their plutocracy/cryptocracy, aside from Christianity.They fear what they attack and seek to destroy.  And they attack white males and also Christians . . . well, the minority that are real Christians, and not just Churchians.

                            Yes, capitalism did that, led by the noted capitalist country, the USSR.
At the time that the Equal Rights amendment was being considered, women in the US comprised a little over a third of the workforce, heavily skewed in secretarial, clerical and education. At the same time, USSR’s workforce was over half women, and they were well represented in heavy industry.

Jews ran the USSR too. Right into the ground, just like what is happening to late stage USA.
Both ideologies were really just elaborate jewish excuses to kill or neuter the old King and replace him with themselves.
Now they seem to favor the word “Democracy”.

                        I disagree. The Brown decision specifically refers to public education. That when it comes to education, separate is inherently unequal.
It’s much like Hart-Celler. The Act itself set quotas for 150k Europeans, and around 4k each from Asia and Africa.
Brown and Hart were little more than a foot in the door. It’s the bastards who subsequently kicked the door off its hinges who are to blame.

                            First off, you might want to ask yourself why “The Brown Test” is a foundation of civil rights jurisprudence. If it is a trivial ruling, why does very lawyer learn about it and know what “The Brown Test” means?
Second, Hart-Celler eliminated the national origins quotas. It erased half a century of immigration limits and led to the open borders regime we see today.

                                Understood. Like @Ostei said, Brown became a slippery slope. But ITS roots are in Marbury v. Madison, in which the USSC gave itself the power of judicial review. Without that slippery slope, the USSC had only the power to write opinions, not to make rulings.
What is it with members of the USSC named “Marshall” that they become instrumental in the overthrow of civil society?

                    Brown was immensely expansive.  If people are required to relinquish their children to years of forced government education/indoctrination, those with whom they associate and by whom they are taught is vitally important.  Most of the lawyers behind Brown were Jewish, and they were motivated not by ‘love’ for the blacks, but resentment and hatred of Christian Whites.

                        The front organization behind BROWN was the NAACP, which was created and initially openly run by Jews. The black nationalist Marcus Garvey, after his one and I suspect only meeting with the NAACP, famously said he didn’t see a black person on the committee. What he also didn’t see was a white person. Thurgood Marshall, who argued the case, as repayment got elevated to the Supreme Court by ol’ marse Schlomo via their other puppet LBJ.

                    ‘”Brown” was a catastrophe.  On the surface it was bad enough. It replaced the old Plessy v Ferguson “separate but equal” doctrine, relying on mid 20th century US social science to rule that separate was inherently unequal.
This foray by judges into areas way beyond their competence and authority was at best utopian nonsense.  But then it ran into the fact that “white” was better.  So only non whites were harmed by separation, and thus had a justifiable grievance.
“Brown” made access to white people a constitutional right.

                        ““Brown” made access to white people a constitutional right.”Sort of, but only because they included a case from Delaware(?) in the decision, because that case explicitly held that White schools were superior. The reason they rejected Plessy was that while they could not dispute that schools in those cases were already or were being made equal in objective terms, “[o]ur decision, therefore, cannot turn on merely a comparison of these tangible factors in the Negro and white schools involved in each of the cases. We must look instead to the effect of segregation itself on public education.”Read the decision for yourself. It’s only a few pages. You have been lied to. Repeatedly. Enough that you recite that as if it were true.

            And then there are those who argue you can’t get an “ought” from an “is”. That there are racial differences, and that there are the exceptional “Magic Negros” says absolutely nothing about how a society ought to be constructed. “Both” sides (I still maintain it’s more of an analog variable than a digital one) are so fixated on imposing a political “one size fits all” that any outcome other than chaos and disaster is vanishingly likely.

                Exceptions vs. broader society, ‘analog’ variables…Alas and alack, I am inflicted with Confucian Rectification of Names obsessive compulsive autistic tendencies. So:I think the vocabulary you are looking for is that associated with probability distributions. The simpler case of Sowell vs. D’Shawn is simply extreme right tail vs rest of ’em. The not quite felicitous ‘analog’ analogy is better thought of as two partly intersecting distributions or a bimodal distribution depending on use case. I think you were saying you thought there might be some overlap of opinion rather than a sharp divide when you refer to ‘Both Sides’ of a political difference above — so intersecting distros it would be.Regardless, being able to juggle and manipulate crude artist’s impression bell curve sketches in one’s head and having basic vocab to impart this to others who also have a slight familiarity with concepts is helpful. Population vs. Individual / IKAGO is the Bridge of Asses which crosses the river to Our Thing.

                At this point, yes, that’s the only conclusion. They view themselves as part of the anointed intellectual class and that requires them to avoid certain truths, so they avoid them. No one in their circles ever chide them for it, so it doesn’t bother them.

                    Captain: Harsh but true.  Sailer is more than aware of the black propensity for violence, the Jewish and Asian propensity for ethnic nepotism, and the Mestizo propensity for both.  He is only ‘scientific’ when it suits him, and he regards all people as fungible if they share his sensibilities and conception of intellect.  Sailer pretends to be self-effacing but is actually quite arrogant in which data he deigns to use and which data he determinedly ignores.

            All of this talk of equality versus inequalilty is really something of a red herring. Far more important is difference versus sameness. Frankly, it doesn’t bother me that Indians in AINO earn more, on average, than whites. Hell, more power to ’em. What does bother me is their aesthetic and cultural difference. I simply don’t want to live in a nation where I’m surrounded by groups who are radically different from my group, which is whites. And that difference cannot be remedied by government programs and social engineering. It is ineradicable.

                “I simply don’t want to live in a nation where I’m surrounded by groups who are radically different from my group, which is whites.”Well, that ship has sailed—especially in the US, but in the West in general, hasn’t it?  At best, in the US, we need to return back to a time of segregation.  Legally enforced segregation.  Would be nice to have such on a State by State basis, but easier to enforce/create on a community basis as was the case when I was a youngster.Right now it seems only the wealthy can, by dint of $$$, buy some sense of separation and security—but even then are forced to pay “Dane gelt” to keep the hoards away.  Of course, given the (pathological) aspect of universal suffrage, what parasite is going to vote for deprivation from its host?  In there lies the rub.

                    It is far more feasible to work toward the creation of a white ethnostate, which will emerge from AINO’s rubble than to try to reinvent the wheel within the structure of AINO. I abandonded all hope for AINO directly Biden was installed and now think exclusively in terms of what can be fashioned for whites in its aftermath.

            That’s an opening for a seasonally appropriate joke from the 1980s. Here it is, more or less:
The Democratic Party has announced they will change the organization’s mascot from a donkey to a condom. After input from many focus groups, reasons for the change were given as:
It symbolizes the commitment to safe sex.
It protects a bunch of pricks.
Most importantly, it brings a feeling of warmth and togetherness to party “members” even as they are being screwed.

            They are selected for management because of their paraphilias bro.There is no need to think it anymore, we now know it for a fact.Epstein, P-Diddy, most of our elite class for quite some time have been compromised by jewish handlers. The public knows this now.They choose to elevate the people they can tape having sex with kids or doing some other horrible thing that would make normal people sick. Permanent control, through threat of ruination. They always have that tape they can “leak” if any of their puppets get uppity.It’s quite a toxic system. I’m frankly amazed that our society has had enough inertia not to collapse under it for so long. Those days are over though. That cow has clearly run dry.What comes next? My guess is a strongman. Would definitely prefer Hitler or Putin to Robespierre though. But there has never really been a situation quite like ours before so who knows? Closest is probably Russia, but their demographic and social problems pale in comparison to ours.One thing is obvious enough, we are going to need to bring segregation back somehow if we want to stop our homelands from crumbling further into the ground. Nigs are intolerable to live around and ruin every area they infect. This too, is fact. We have many case studies. Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, Cleveland, etc. etc. etc.

            Only the “woke” West is so stupid as to ignore such aspects (racial ties) of highly placed personnel.  However, I’m wondering if the Israelis are that stupid as to trust such information—if important—to the US Defense department, and therefore the validity of the information “leaked”.

                The GAE being an (at least) equal partner in the wars Israel is waging is the only good explanation for why the Pentagon would have the plans in the first place, Iranian lesbians or no. Or perhaps it is the one calling the shots, and not Israel.

            At another site like this a few years back there was a military officer commenter whose job included, weirdly, accomplishing some normal military objectives. One to which he was assigned was to study and remedy the Chinese spy problem in his particular area of responsibility.He dutifully studied and was surprised—military guys are never really /ourguys/—to find a clear singular problem with a clear singular remedy: Don’t allow any significant information to come into the view to anyone of Chinese descent or any man married to a Chinese woman.Allthe spies were them, and known spies were ahugepercentage of them. He understood that he was forbidden from offering any solution that might work, that if he even hinted at the truth he’d be in career-ending trouble, and he didn’t know what to do. He understood that he was assigned to fail, one way or the other: tank the assignment or fail the “vibe check.”Our friend Whiskey is wrong*: It’s the military that made diversity/DEI/anti-whiteness/etc. America’s ideology, and it’s a military junta that enforces it—openly since 2020. The services emptying of whites and refilling with Chinese spies is fully intended. They’re real Americans, and you’re the enemy.*Thedraft whites to die for their sinsthing might happen, though. That’s a normal (now) military objective.

                To be clear, it is the process of real War, not pretend Special Forces Olympics forever wars. Real War tends to winnow out per Ike in Crusade in Europe, the peacetime butt kissers, who advance in the peacetime army. See: Grant, Sherman, Forrest, Patton, etc.Moreover, there are significant military aligned people like Boeing and others who realize that open borders = no military spending. Already we have lost forever about 10 carrier groups because of the social spending on “immigrants!”Musk is the creation of the Military Industrial Complex. He would not exist without the money poured into Space X. Which in turn launches about 100 times the tonnage of China as a country.Real military power requires: A. a native, no foreign dependencies industrial capacity. B. A workforce that can work enthusiastically overtime to surge capacity. C. A military force that can be drafted into service mostly agreeable; which is relatively High IQ and has its motivations.Most of the military leadership knows this, outside the “Perfumed Princes” i.e. top generals. Against the Chinese and Russians, we are toast as it stands now.

        Rufo is not that smart, but he knows what he’s doing. They are setting up a post-election purge. It looks like Trump has been promised the presidency and an end to his legal difficulties, but the conditions are greenlighting war with Iran and cracking down on “antisemitism”.
Similarly, Elon Musk will get to go to Mars, but he will have to kick the Fuentes types off twitter. I expect the censorship will be justified by a false flag, OK City style terror attack early in Trump’s term.

            I think it’s an open question if the people hypothetically promising Trump the presidency can actually deliver it to him. Unless they really do control the dominion machines. Because I am pretty sure that the people determined to fortify the election against him cannot be reasoned with or dissuaded.

                As Z pointed out a couple months ago, it’s very plausible that the fortification doesn’t happen in PA this year. Shapiro wants to run for president and he’s not going to be able to do that in 2028 or 2032 if Kamala wins. And just that by itself might be enough. Also, the narratives around Kamala have totally crumbled. Nobody is calling her brat anymore. Nobody is posting coconut tree memes. She’s going on TV and making a fool of herself every day. She’s trotting out Liz Cheney and B-list celebs to try to make the case (the big ones like Beyonce and Jay-Z are lying low, probably because of the Diddy stuff). It’s clear she doesn’t have it and enthusiasm is low. The media is still running cover for her, obviously, but not with the same gusto they did in 2020 for Biden.Not saying it’s over, but the overall thesis of people like Z, who said that Kamala  will be less popular the more people see of her, seems to have been borne out.

Your point about Iran is interesting.
It makes me wonder if the current hysteria about North Korean troops in Russia is a desperate attempt by the current regime to widen the war so they can declare martial law, cancel the election, write off all existing debt, and trap everyone into digital ID with CBDCs.

        One word to destroy a civilization: this is the power of spells. It is also, the power of story, as the human operating system.
Humans think in ideograms, in camps, clusters, connotations. This unique spell sets up a kind of schizophrenia, or doublethink, or reverbrating cognitive dissonance.
How to defeat this one, ONE, word?The word, the concept, “racism”.As if that were a bad thing, not a natural, necessary fence, a thing to be honored.
Perhaps, by recognizing it is seen as a good in nonwhites, and a sin in whites.

        The, “Rufo Position”, which you point out well predates him, is the Regime Orthodoxy. That orthodoxy is moralism and moralizing. The RP is saying, “Racism is bad. You are being racist therefore you are bad.”He is no different than Jesse Jackson in that regard. One quibble is Jackson rallied mobs to chant that our civilization must be destroyed. Rufo, just ignores that issue all together and thus permits its demolition.In terms of the moralizing, The Radical Egalitarians have the power so their accusations have tremendous consequences and weight. The Leftists, (Rufo, Con Inc., JK Rowling, Musk, … …), don’t have much power so it is merely name calling.So in the sandbox of politics those permitted to enter are 800 pound silver backs (Michelle Goldberg, Kendi, Ignatiev …), vs. cry baby name callers, (Rufo, Rubin, Kotkin, Con Inc…)

        “The colorblind dogma makes anti-racism sound reasonable and its implementation would make the Khmer Rouge seem tame.”I told my Dad, who when he was young was thoroughly indoctrinated into being a proggy, about 6-7 years ago that the path they were on was going to lead to 200 million dead. He was stunned. The notion doesn’t seem so shocking any more. They at least have an inkling that not everything is going as promised by the aliens and mutants on their television screens.There is no way in hell they are going to change course without some pushback, though. It’s a kind of shit-test. If you let weaker people destroy you simply because you choose not to fight back, they they will.

        Young people are pretty redpilled on race. On things like LGBT and abortion, not so much, but they have spent years seeing misbehavior from people of certain ancestry on X, in streaming, they see what happens in schools, they saw the same stuff we all did after 2020, etc. Even the regime has started to tacitly acknowledge realities. Twenty-five years ago, underperforming schools in places like Baltimore and Detroit were met with a chrous of anger and tons of resources to fix it. Nowadays, it’s greeted with a shrug and the idea that asking these people to turn in their work on time and behave in class is cultural imperialism and we can’t expect them to do it. The race hustlers also seem to be a step or two below the prior generation in ability and intelligence, and can’t rely on their partners in the media to shape their image like they used to.I suspect though, that Rufo will see the winds change and pivot accordingly. He is much too smart to actually believe the nonsense he spouts.

        I must disagree with the idea that “It is a binary issue. You either … think it is immoral to make decisions based on race [or] reject the idea that this behavior is immoral.”It’s perfectly consistent to think that large population groups differ in average traits, but also that individual people should be judged as individuals. If all we know about people is that they’re in group X, then it’s justified to treat them on that basis until we know more. As John Derbyshire pointed out before he was purged byNational Review, if we’re suddenly surrounded by a group of X members who are unknown to us, then we should get away from them ASAP. But that is quite different from meeting a Thomas Sowell and refusing to talk with him because he’s in a particular group. We know more about him than that he’s in group X; likewise for any X member in a non-threatening situation. It’s common sense to treat people as individuals as long as it’s not suicidally crazy to do so.The American Declaration of Independence omitted a single word, and that omission caused a lot of our confusion about the issue:https://the-1000-year-view.com/2020/08/20/the-declarations-missing-word/

            “It’s common sense to treat people as individuals as long as it’s not suicidally crazy to do so.”When I screen candidates for a technical position, if I can tell with high probability they are a black or African, I won’t waste my time with a phone interview.  That is common sense.  When something has been confirmed over and over and over in sixty years of real-life experience its common sense to use that experience as one’s guide.Sure, when one knows a person, like Thomas Sowell, or Walter Williams, or my old Platoon Sergeant and First Sergeant, then treat the person with the respect they deserve and have earned.  But don’t be a fool and let the statistical outliers guide your actions with the vast majority of the populations of these groups.

            Your judging people as individuals is simply a high-minded way of proclaiming IKAGO.  Like it or not, people’s potential (good and bad) is a product of their genetics, and their living up or down to that potential is affected by environment.  Thomas Sowell, Mr. Magic IKAGO himself, refuses to acknowledge theracial IQ gap and instead blames black pathologies on White ‘hillbilly/redneck culture.’  He cannot and will not acknowledge genetic racialreality because he has black children and grandchildren.  And since reversion to the mean is real, why would a White want Sowell or his family as neighbors?  Exceptions merely serve to prove the rule.

                Another commenter mentioned the basic issue: One part is a statement about facts (“the average of people in group X is different from other groups”) and the other part is a rule about our behavior (“we ought to treat people equally if the circumstances are equal”). They’re mostly independent of each other.

                Exactly.  The aspect of IKAGO is a precept that *you*, yourself, are free to follow in your *personal* endeavors/interactions.  It is quite a different story to impose those standards upon other Whites in “societal” decisions.
Note that whereas I am a stanch supporter/promoter of Thomas Sowell, he is a “very lonely man”.

        In fairness, Rufo probably understands this, but the money in seeming to not understand it is too good to turn down.The default DR position is that these stances are genuine moral expressions and not the result of financial incentive.  This is particularly true when it comes to the subject of race, where having your color-blindness recognized, particularly by a numinous negro, provides a strong dopamine rush for most.If you’ve partaken in any normie-con media in the past week or two, you’ve seen it on full display.  A slightly larger sliver of the black male population will vote for the (R) candidate this year?  That calls for getting a “based” black man on your show to acknowledge and compliment your erection.If Rufo pushes Brown v. Board narrative, it’s likely he firmly believes in its fundamental truth.

            That’s bang on. We have a hard time imagining Leftists–including Civ-Nats–actually believe their own bull because we are a very logical and rational group of people. It is difficult for us to hoist in that anybody can truly believe Leftist lunacy. But most of them really do. The fame and the fat stock portfolios are just nice side dividends.

        Has anyone noticed that the FED cut rates .50 and………. rates have gone up! People in the financial sphere are shocked they cut .50 when the stock market is booming and unemployment is so low, i take a different view. 2020 was a financial event, with exaggerated flu, fear porn, and bullying. They cut .5 to see how much control they have, and if you take the reaction of rates, i’d say slim to none. Don’t think we’ll have much longer to wait for this stupid system to totally destroy itself

            Yep.  The problem is that the government has too much debt to service, hence cutting rates—yet, we still spend $3T+ more each year than we take in.  The market is filled with “dumb money” whereas the smarter folk like Warren Buffet remain all in cash waiting for the inevitable crash.  The system is going down, it’s just when and exactly how.  Even my investment brokerage buys gold as a hedge.Dumb money is not simply a slur on the small public investor, but refers to any number of pension funds and the like where there is little control by “Joe Sixpack”.  Look at any breakdown of investor class based upon wealth—like thedecamillionaireand above—and you’ll see more investment outside of what we term ”the market” and into areas of traditional wealth retention.  They have people, we have 401k’s.  Sigh…

            They just follow short term rates, which while up it’s only just barely.  Kalr Denninger said the rates went down because the bond market knows the Fed is just a follower and so the big investment houses “made the market” so that they could exploit the cut they knew would come.  Far be it for me to doubt his market prowess but it could also be the inevitable dip in rates as the economic suck sets in.

        I wish whites were more tribal, not because i think tribalism is a good thing but because other ethnics are tribal and they are all allied against whites.
In our upper middle class neighborhood of about 50 homes, I can count one Trump sign, (Catholic) and 13 Harris signs (all Jews).
Of course there would be more Trumps signs, but they get stolen and there is also the fear of reprisals.

                White citizens with traditionalist attitudes make up roughly 50% of that group’s population.   That is not enough to impose their will on the remaining groups in American who temperamentally want to give the unknown future a chance, that is, the collectivist/liberal/progressives of different shades, including other whites of an adventurous temperament.Therefore, if you or others of similar bent want to win the Game of Life, you all must cooperate against the degenerates by strategic and tactical acceptance of allies whose appearances are divergent, but whose attitudes align with yours.I live in Orlando and have lived in the remaining geographical locales in Florida.  There are numerous Spanish speaking and yes, darker skinned citizens, who share your desire to live as empathic/altruistic adults, not selfish materialistic children.  Join them in fighting the spiteful mutants and cowardly children in adult bodies.  You don’t have to break bread with them or their families, but you do need to accept help in the war of all against all.Grow up, madam.

                        You are on the side of people whose appearance you use as an absolute gauge of their trustworthiness as human beings, and hence potential allies with you and yours in competing against your social enemies.  I am saying that shorthand way of looking at life is a limitation on your capacity to achieve your goals.The fact is not all whites value the things you value, so if you want to be effective in the world that you constantly say you want to reflect your view of the good life in order to pass on a positive legacy for your children, grandchildren, and any other persons you care about, you must accept help from other people who don’t look like you, but who value the same things and are seeking the same world for themselves and their loved ones.That reality, that conservative European whites do not have the numbers anymore to force the society to honor their lives, seems elementary, as does the resulting need to expand one’s horizons on the possible.  If you are as wise as you proclaim from your travels, that requirement for success, to take help where available, would be equally elementary.I am not willing to go hide from life in some rural enclave, and to turn my nose at everyone who does not meet the ideal image of White purity.  I am also not scared to voice my thoughts in my own name, unlike the majority here on this Blog.  I may win the Game of Life, I may lose, but I will compete using all the resources at my disposal-no risk, no reward.

                    “White citizens with traditionalist attitudes make up roughly 50% of that group’s population.”— Which country are we talking about? The variance from that percentage will vary greatly, even within countries. Honduras, for example, is largelymestizo, with a fewnegroson the Mosquito Coast, along with the usual admixtures. Guatemala is almost pureindioin the countryside, mestizo in the cities (note that their very location often determines how they will define themselves). Costa Rica is mostly white.

                Close enough; they are a successful mix, and we need allies.They turn “whiter’ in sympathies and outlook as they turn lighter; I argue that since we need numbers, note how they quickly repopulated South America after a 90% populations loss due to foreign disease.I say it is because both originate from the Northern hemisphere, and are somewhat cognate. Note that anyone who mixes with whites turns lighter (and smarter), more evidence that we are the Upgrade.Someday we may be a mere trace, a 1 to 4 percent, of the record, as are the Neanderthal; let us put that off a quarter million years if we can. The Erectus darkies of the south must not outbreed our Sapiens future.

                    Perhaps my “shorthand” was misunderstood.  I lack the patience to figure out how to add the ‘unequal’ symbol to my text.  Mestizos are not White.  I’ve known many who are half.  I’ve known many who are quarter.  They all side with their non-White kin.  Ally with whomever you wish; I will continue to refuse what I see as a devil’s bargain.

                    Using the Republican share of the hispanic vote at33 percent or lessas a proxy for white support, every one vote for us yields two for the anti-whites. Probably not a winning strategy. Note that Florida’s hispanic vote is skewed by Castro having kicked out the white propertied elite, who have managed to hold some sway over later working class Cuban migrants. Definitely not the case in California and elsewhere.

True. But Hispanic/= mestizo. Hence why “hispanic” truly is a social construct, unlike real racial differences.

            “Hispanic” is just a social construct. It’s like calling someone an “Asian/Pacific Islander” and then generalizing based on that. Latin America was mostly founded by European men and Amerindian women. Thinkmestizos. Slavery broughtnegros, who begatzambosormulattos, depending.Indioswere at the bottom of the social order—unless yourindiospoke Spanish and lived in a town, whereupon he might be considered amestizo. So“white” in the Latin American context is likewise a social construct. Lighter complexion plays a role to be sure, but acting white is also a thing. Natural allies? I can promise you, your averageindiowill almost certainly be a communist, not unlike yourSephardi “white.”Mestizos, etcetera will be very much a mixed bunch, pun intended.

        The trouble with blacks and whites is on an individual basis it can work but on a group basis it can’t.  There is a spectrumSo the issue can never be solved, as it were.  A guy can hate what blacks represent in terms of all the costs and social burdens and the crime but then sit back having a beer and strike up a conversation with a black guy and have a great time.  But as soon as five white guys wander in, he gets nervous, and vice versa.But there is much more to it.  It is a very complex issue.  Hardly binary imo

        I see it more as ternary than binary. At one end you’ve got a vocal minority with control of mass media and organs of propaganda and brainwashing such as schools and universities, who maintain that race is a “social construct”, that it’s just skin-deep, that the dark-skinned have suffered from centuries of persecution and discrimination. Then you have the vast bovine herds of white Americans in the middle, who can sense at some level that there are differences in behavior among the races but aren’t smart or vigorous enough to make their way to the relevant literature by people like Lynn, Rushton, Jensen, and the like, and so can be persuaded that historic discrimination is one of the culprits behind differening levels of crime, educational attainment, and employment. And then at the other end you have the race realists who areau faitwith the literature and have a clear understanding of why race differences exist and persist.

        Let me repeat without the blather:
“Racism”, a natural and necessary fence, is seen as a good in nonwhites and as a sin in whites.
Reconciling public policy with an individual ethic is impossible;the underlying assumption is that whiteness is the sin…
_________________(We live by the strictures of ancient racial politics.This is the crack in the foundation; Aryan whites were seen as the Original Sin.They then proffered a cure: raise another people as First above the Aryan whites.)

        I’m convinced all of the political turmoil today is because of two issues: Immigration and ObamaCare. The Republicans exposed themselves as controlled opposition by fighting Trump on the wall every step of the way, not to mention wagging their fingers and telling people, “That’s not who we are.”When they capitulated on repealing obamacare, even if the repeal was flawed, they showed their heart was never in it.I guess there were also a few other moments along this journey that left a meaningful impression, like trying to kneecap the TEA Party.That’s why the base has no use for establishment Republicans these days. Cucks.

            “That’s why the base has no use for establishment Republicans these days. Cucks.”Worse, duplicitous liars.  They (Rep’s) voted for repeal several times when the Congress was not in their hands and repeal impossible—that included the great establishment/machine Rep, John McCain.  This was good campaign fodder for the rubes back home.  McCain was the defiant Rep vote when the last ACA repeal was voted down under the Trump administration.  McCain was the great voice on the Rep side against building “the wall”, under Bush waay before Trump took office as well.McCain Republicanism is why there is so much contention wrt the Rep primaries in AZ.  For years, the Rep’s ran on “vote for the Rep we put up—even if you need to hold your nose—you can run your candidate during primaries.”  So after Trump, Trumpist Rep’s did just that.  However, now they are called extremists for going against “the Party”.  Even to the extent that old school Rep’s are coming out against the “new” Rep’s (Trumpists) who won via primary process.

        People like Rufo only have agency if they can help instigate an authoritarian society in which jackboots enforce their policy-of-the-day, such as forced compliance with their rules. And in their mind, this enforcement is mild and just. Until it isn’t. Cancel culture anyone? And we cannot resolve this dichotomy with words. Sorry, but that’s just the way it is. Eventually, the solution gets existential and man-made selection must step in where nature is no longer able to help us. 4S &amp; focus will arrive sooner than you think.

        “Regardless of motivations, the people promoting the concept of a colorblind society are unwilling to address the root causes”.This is not so much about causes as it is about effects. Rufo and his ilk are basically tasked with defending the status quo: the distribution of economic and political power. Defending the status quo is about defending the moral foundation of the System. If the System is colorblind, then the power distribution is moral, right? The alternative – tribalism – would likely yield a vastly different distribution of power.

        Nope: “You either accept or reject the normative and positive claims baked into the word racism.”
Between true and not true there is nothing, but between accept and reject (interpreting the latter as denial) there is undecidedness. Maybe one is deliberately reserving judgement, or timid, or just oblivious to the matter, like a young child. There isalwaysa middle ground between affirmation and denial.

        Speaking of racism, here’s a treat. Haven’t seen this movie in a while and it’s on Pluto. Someone also put it up on YouTube. Slaughter (1972) with Jim Brown.Jim Brown gets called the N-word about a dozen times during the movie and just shrugs it off. If this movie was filmed today, he’d have a meltdown and run to his safe space, or maybe start slashing people to death. But seriously, I always liked this movie. Lots of gunfire and lots of bad guys getting shot to death — great flick.(Not sure if the Pluto version keeps all the n words. I’m guessing it’s sanitized, but the one on YouTube definitely has them. The YouTube version is the one I watched.)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43WrPGvkMKc

        The polls show that trust in almost every sector of society — from the media to elected leaders — is on the decline. Fed a steady stream of lies for so long, the average person feels like a Bobo doll that’s been punched around.The institutions that no longer have trust can only regain it through continued examples of scrupulous honesty. But the mass media, for instance, is addicted to slanting the news. It’s hard to break an addiction. Not until the newspapers and TV stations are teetering on bankruptcy will change happen. Media executives must get it in their heads that they are there to serve the public, not ham-handedly manipulate the public.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            “Not until the newspapers and TV stations are teetering on bankruptcy will change happen.”
You never really understood what the bailouts in 08 were huh? Same for the people that say go woke go broke. They all went broke in 08, the entire corporate system. They’re still here, but yeah go woke go broke.  Stupid and woke will increase until they can no longer print money.  I’d argue woke comes directly from the government, and if you want a chance at bailout money you better virtue signal damnit.  Idiots

            Apparently you didn’t read the article. Those polls don’t correspond to reality. A small % of people say they trust the media in polls, but when the media told them covid was the new black plague, the overwhelming majority bought it.
As for the idea that the media will realize they were wrong to lie and reform at some point, keep huffing that copium. I’m sure there will be a big Nuremberg 2.0 for covid as well, where everyone who perpetrated the lie confesses and cries or is put in jail. Keep dreaming.

                You seem to say/imply the media was lying.  In essence that’s true, but was it deliberate lying—as in the media knew the truth, but reported differently?  Or was it rather because the media is too dumb, mendacious, and lazy to investigate, discover, and publish the truth—therefore, they simply accepted what the government agencies stated in press handouts?I tend to believe the later for reasons of a declining news media ethos and intellect of personnel.  I also must remark that the truth was out there for anyone with the time and effort to review, which, if I recall, most folk commenting here *were* aware of at the time.

                    The lies disseminated by the gubmint comported with media preconceptions and predilections. That is why the media didn’t bother doing research and confirmation/debunking. When you hear what you want to hear, you just roll with it. Confirmation bias, I think they call it.
