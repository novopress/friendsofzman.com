        […] Shrillary Clinton and her allergy to the truth could take a thousand writers years to document. An excellent piece at the Z Blog makes short work of it. While you’re there, read about the Chocolate Savior. […]

        If she only knew how much laughter she engenders in people. I am laughing right now, thinking about her calling herself the “champion” of everyday Americans. She is one of the most vile, dishonest, and corrupt politicians in our country. I’m Ready For Hillary all right– ready to see her behind bars, but I’ll settle for her humiliating defeat by a challenger from her own party. If she sees that coming ahead of time, she’ll drop out, citing “health concerns.”

        According to Theodore White’s Making of the President 1968, Nixon spent a good deal of his time between 1964 and 1968 traveling around the country building up a network of support for a run in 1968. His main foe was Rockefeller, who believed he was entitled to the nomination. After all, he had called out Goldwater and stormed out of the 1964 convention. Nixon was the better politician.One thing Nixon’s team did was revive a a technique from Eisenhower’s campaign of 1956. They filmed Nixon answering questions from an audience in a TV studio. These Q and A’s were used as commercials. And who can forget the slogan, “Nixon’s the One”.It’s my own considered opinion that Hillary Clinton will not be a candidate come January or February next year.

        Obama was elected, then re-elected. Anything, probably catastrophic for the country, can happen.

        Hillary’s ambition is so intense that she has never stopped to think that an executive position is quite alien to her personality. In her entire life Hillary Rodham had one executive leap which absolutely had to be taken, and it was left undone.

        How can a candidate like her, with zero appeal to white males as a voting block, have even the notion of a chance? Maybe i don’t get the nuances here in Europe, but i just don’t see it happening.I wouldn’t vote for Hillary even if she campaigned naked, and i do like my cougars!But at least her nomination would make the democrats officially the ragtag minority party, all in, and as such drive even more men away. At that point you may just as well let the census data decide instead of elections, it would be close enough and you save some money…

            In America, the political class is on a teeter-totter. One party rises while the other falls. As soon as one peaks, the other begins to rise. Right now, the Democrats are falling and will hit bottom with Clinton. As soon as the Republican wins, his party will start to suffer.Then there is the spiritual waves. In the 18th and 19th centuries these where Christian revivals. In the 20th they were replaced by Progressive awakenings. There was one that peaked with Wilson in 1913. Another with the New Deal and Roosevelt. Another with Kennedy and Johnson. This wave started with Bush beating Gore and has finally petered out.That all means the Democrats are pretty much exhausted and will stagger around for a decade or so offering up clownish alternatives to the GOP.

            Romney got 58% of the white vote, and it was not good enough to even come close winning. With changing demographics, it will be even harder for the GOP to win in 2016.
