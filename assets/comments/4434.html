        […] Zman listens to David Brooks bloviating about the Baltimore rioting at the Times, and marvels at how much money and liberty was wasted on the effort to make the American underclass equal, how futile it all seems and just how much has been destroyed in the process. […]

        The problem with Brooks et al sitting around, waiting for someone to bring them salvation, is that they worship at the altar of the intellectual.  Essentially, they’re waiting for Wile E Coyote, Sooper Genius to come along and whip out some Acme brand stuff that’ll make it all better.What they don’t want to hear is that the previously mentioned $14K per person was not merely wasted, it was looted. The money did go somewhere. Just not to the poor. It was used to build the bureaucracy. And by the way, that particular bureaucracy has a vested interest in poverty, and will fight to keep it.

        Brooks’ gibberish helps hide the notion that when more economic benefits accrue to the individuals who live in fatherless families, the people who wait for the handouts instead of finding real work, and those who look for an extra handout after the neighborhood is burned down, then you get fatherless freeloaders who look for reasons to burn down their own cities.
Then people such as Brooks ask the rest of us to examine our own lives and ways of living, so that we can feel guilty for not supporting a more lavish version of the same misguided notion.

            The problem is not that they are fatherless. It’s just as well they don’t know their fathers. The problem is that they are not motherless. American orphanages were very successful in raising children into above average adults.

        Another good stat I learned from P. Schaefer on MR is the “for every hour worked in America we spend $12 in healthcare” factoid. Just think about what that means in regards to immigration and the future.

        “…we are no closer to the egalitarian paradise than fifty years ago when much of this madness began.”Yes, I believe that to be true. Indeed, I would say we were further away from that egalitarian paradise. However, 50 years ago was 1965. If you accept the common definition of a Baby Boomer as anyone born in the 20 years between the end of WWII and 1965, then at that time the very oldest boomers were a mere 20 – and most were much younger.The baby boom generation, as a group, has made mistakes, but the “War on Poverty” was not one of them. That particular boondoggle was initiated by Lyndon Johnson, and was supported by his cohorts in power at the time. And that would have been…The Greatest Generation!But really, all of that blame-the-baby-boom-generation-for-every-evil-that-has-occurred-since-the-sixties business is not only wrong, it’s irrelevant. Generations don’t “do” anything. Individuals do. And the baby boom generation has been nearly an even split politically since, well, 1965 or thereabouts.
