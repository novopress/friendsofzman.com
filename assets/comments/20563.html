Non Whites will relieve us of those responsibilities.It would be great if all dissidents could all be on the same page in how to approach this but that‚Äôs not going to happen.  A temporary alliance and a bit of tongue biting in facing the above backdoor genocide isn‚Äôt going to kill us. Not bundling ourselves into a fasces will.This isn‚Äôt Romans vs Gauls, Catholics vs Protestants, North vs South, nor one form of Western populist Liberalism vs another form of Western populist Liberalism.  We are faced with an actual clash of civilizations, one which we are losing.  Western Civilization could literally collapse under the onslaught.  40,000 years usurped not by warriors but by foreign parasites.  A disciplined focus on the immediate and most pressing problem of demographics could keep less pressing differences under rein and harness all of our energies in stopping our destruction.  Losing isn‚Äôt simply another period in Western history, it‚Äôs the end of Western history.

            Destroyed by our own success and vanity. But therein lies our hope. We are not being overwhelmed by a better people but by ourselves.
Our resurrection is in our hands. We don‚Äôt need a miracle. We simply need to wake up. And that coming demographic change likely will be one hell of an alarm clock.

                God I hope you‚Äôre right. We‚Äôve been waiting for that alarm to go off for ages.  My biggest worry is that as things deteriorate more and more of our people simply begin dropping out because they don‚Äôt see anything worth fighting for.  At some point a quandary becomes a lost cause.  Too many people going down their own rabbit hole isn‚Äôt helping.

                Just so. Imagine the heady 1950s and 60s in the USA. We‚Äôd just won the world war, democracy was victorious. Anything was possible. We could finally throw off the last shackles of the Negro. Now with equal rights, he would join his rightful place in civilization. Meanwhile, we saw that we must generously let in a lot more of the foreigners who would become good Americans in just a generation or two. Hell, we were going to the Moon. Nothing was impossible! Alas, reality set in. I grew up in the 1960s and 70s. Most of the unintended consequences of Civil Rights had only begun to erode the older system. All of us here know how those ideals turned out in reality. Often overlooked is IT WAS WHITE PEOPLE WHO LET IT HAPPEN. Not communists. Not Jewish lawyers. White people. üôÅ

            Great comment. Demographics are destiny.
The pro gun people in Canada keep screaming about Trudeau‚Äôs tyranny‚Ä¶ but never at the demographics that make it possible. Chinese and Indians hate guns. Just because 1/75 guys at the gun range are whitewashed Indians doesn‚Äôt mean Indians are ok with guns in general.

                ‚ÄúNot to worry, empty stomachs are a great motivation. Won‚Äôt be long until American whites aren‚Äôt fat &amp; happy.‚Äù True. Other great motivators include being attacked, hated, abused, slandered, shamed, and ultimately possibly murdereden masse. Oppression‚Äîor the realisticthreatof it‚Äîis a wonderful tool for driving people together. That would be us.

        We went the other way on the children thing.When my high school sweat heart got pregnant, we got married. Coming from shitlib families we were considered a disgrace, and nobody gave our marriage a chance of lasting more than a couple years. (We just had our 35th anniversary back in March). Contrarily, unlike the other kids in our families, we are the only ones still on our first marriage. All the others are divorced.  üôÇI hate to say it, but having a child was the biggest life mistake I ever made. I was in trouble right from the start. The other shitlibs in my family went to work on my daughter and when I tried to parent my kid, all I got was flak from the relatives. They felt that my kid should be able to behave in ways they would have shot me for when I was her age.When she started flunking out at school and acting like a monkey in class, I gave her a spanking and told her to shape up. I nearly had Family Social Services called down on me and could have gone to jail for it. ‚ÄúWe do time outs now! Spanking is child abuse!!!‚Äù her teacher screeched at me. I told her to FOAD and have no doubts that if I tried that today ‚Äì I‚Äôd be in court up on charges. Everybody carefully avoided noticing that my kid went from being a problem student to an accomplished honour student after having her backside tanned. I got my revenge though: when she graduated 6 months early from high school with honours, I rubbed their noses in it. They hated it too. How smug I was! My marriage was intact, my kid had done well and all her options were wide open and she was a beautiful young woman that had the world by the tail. She went to university to take the sciences. How proud I was.Then disaster struck. She had gone to an open house for a no-name college and learned that she could party her way to a fine arts degree. They were honest enough to say ‚ÄúThe money wouldn‚Äôt be great‚Ä¶‚Äù but then followed it up with ‚Äúfollow your dreams, and then the money will follow that!‚ÄùShe sand bagged me when she came home to announce that she was dropping the sciences to study art. At the family meeting my in laws showed up and scolded me for being unsupportive. ‚ÄúALL education is GOOD education!!!‚Äù my cucked father in law declared. It was the beginning of the end.She took the course and the rest of the story is classic. My beautiful smart daughter went off to take the liberal arts, and came back an unhappy militant lesbian. We had another family meeting and I was informed the family was now officially pozzed. My daughter and her creepy girlfriend would tell us all how to think and speak, my place in the family was that of a punching bag, but only if I behaved myself, and we were all under the rainbow now. I was exiled a little while later. Being a father has been impossible for decades, Z You dodged a bullet by not having kids. I sometimes get bitter and angry and think about what it would like to be a grandfather and what my grandchildren might have looked like ‚Ä¶ and then I have visions of Greta Thunberg and realize that maybe I have dodged a bullet too.I‚Äôve told this story in your pages many times and must apologize. I spent a lot of time being angry and hurt about this (we no longer speak, me with my daughter or my pozzed family). But‚Ä¶ so many men have lost so much more. I got off fairly lightly. I‚Äôve seen perfectly good men reduced to suicidal wrecks after being divorced and raped in family court by vindictive ex-wives; I‚Äôve seen them drink themselves unconscious after being financially ruined and seeing their kids turned against them by their mothers. We‚Äôve all seen the vile wine soaked cat ladies these women eventually become. I‚Äôve seen perfectly good kids turn into feral scum while their idiot single mothers pose as heroes and powerful wahmen.As you say, Z ‚Äì none of it shouldn‚Äôt have been this way. We shouldn‚Äôt be letting grifters and carpet baggers sell our kids fake degrees in fake universities, Our daughters should not be sluts and degenerates, and our women should not be wine soaked rage heads and cat ladies. Nor should such women be in charge of our affairs.For me, the first serious resistance started right here, right on your blog. I see intelligent men talking factually and dispassionately about the real state of affairs, and considering options and alternatives. If we can‚Äôt hold our families together, we sure as hell won‚Äôt be able to hold our communities or nations together either. The wheels are already coming off.If I have any advice worth listening to ‚Äì it‚Äôs that in certain cases, the shitlibs are right. Don‚Äôt have kids. Fathers are now targets, and if you want to be a good one you will need to be able to take your kid out of the mainstream and support them there for most of their childhood. And that is assuming you marry a good woman and not the average North American Slut.Breed wisely, boys. For those of you caught in this maelstrom just trying to be good fathers ‚Äì you have my prayers.Have a great Friday fellas. Sorry for the novel.Cheers!

            If you don‚Äôt have one already, develop a local mannerbund.  It doesn‚Äôt even have to be explicitly political.  You‚Äôll be shocked have much pain you can absorb and how much easier you can swat away your pozzed families‚Äô idiocy (and influence them), when you have a strong male tribe you are attached to.
Learned this in my twenties when I wondered why everyone saw me as weak and a pushover.  Once I started hanging out with a group of like-minded guys, it changed like a switch.

                I think you men have the right of it. In fact, I think it should become one of the first and foremost missions of the dissident right.Look: we know how these f*cks roll. They sexualize kids in elementary now, and put queers and pedos in charge to teach them everything they didn‚Äôt need to know about anal sex. It goes downhill from there: kids are taught from childhood why Johnny has three daddies, why Trump=Hitler, and why Tyrone and his fellow joggers can never succeed.We need the Boy Scouts back ‚Äì minus the queers and pedophiles. We need boy‚Äôs clubs that teach the young ones how to behave around the girls, and how to be active and constructive in their communities.Young fathers need this too. When I was a younger man all this was still new. There was that, plus the fact that I lived in the hive and wouldn‚Äôt have seen anything of the manosphere, the NRx or the DR‚Ä¶ it wouldn‚Äôt have occurred to me to look.Most of all, I think we need the churches back, and for the women most of all. It gives them a framework of established morals and ethics, the value and joys of motherhood, and financial, spiritual, and emotional support in bad times.This is something that is do-able, and would make for a major kick in the balls to the left ‚Äì and one they desperately need.

            I sincerely feel bad for what happened to you with your daughter.   I am blessed to have great kids who have never given me a minute of trouble.  They are the best thing that happened to me in my entire life.
I can‚Äôt even take credit for them being the way they are.  They have been that way since birth.   I never even had to discipline them.  They are now adults and are much better people than I am.  I just got lucky.

                I generally don‚Äôt give down votes, but ‚Äì you‚Äôre full of chit. I‚Äôve seen any number of parents that brag about their perfect children. Single moms are the worst, they all think their children are ‚Äòamazing‚Äô. And the kids are invariably always monsters. By the time their kids are in their teens they‚Äôre either failing at school or in trouble with the police, or both. Pull my other finger, MA ‚Äì It has bells on it.

                    You are obviously a very bitter, damaged man.I didn‚Äôt tell my story to brag.  In fact, I admitted I got lucky.  But I am no fool.  I know my children and everything i said is true.  I don‚Äôt really care if you think i am full of shit.The purpose of my post was to provide an alternative view your anti-children diatribe.  I don‚Äôt want young people who read this blog to believe that the bleak picture you painted is inevitable.You have posted at length about your personal problems in the past.  You should consider going on Oprah and emoting like the woman that you are rather than spreading your toxic garbage on a site that is focused on furthering the interests of the future generations of white people.  As Lineman said, the future belongs to those who have kids.

                        Yep. My kid put me and her mother through the wringer. It leaves marks. I am still hurt and bitter about it. Perhaps your good fortune rubs salt in a very old wound of mine, and maybe I reacted badly to it. If you and your kids are perfect, smile and carry on.I should shut up about it, I suppose. There‚Äôs enough horror stories about modern love and marriage out there. And perhaps I do react emotionally when I see younger men going through the same meat grinder I did‚Ä¶ or worse.I will adamantly disagree with you and our esteemed blog host: if you are going to have kids, it is something that you really, REALLY need to think about. There are real risks, and if things go the wrong way, you could be in for a world of hurt.

                            John.  All important life decisions involve proportional levels of risk.  Marriage is a risk, even without kids.  Read any of the men‚Äôs groups for eye openers.  And I‚Äôll admit, marriage seems a poor choice for ready availability of sex these days.  Marriage would seem important precisely because of desire for family.In the Jewish tradition it is considered poor form to brag about your children‚Äîas they are a gift from God, good or bad‚Äîand you play a limited roll in the process.  Jewish beliefs aside, we know from HBD science that our majority contribution is from our genome and that often does not turn out well despite our best efforts in nurturing offspring.So if I or others here state for the record our relief that our children have turned out to be better replicas than the original‚Äîit is through the Grace of God that such has occurred‚Äîand not a statement of our inherent superiority in the reproductive process.

                                Any word on how men (or women for the matter) turn out after a divorce? I‚Äôm a sample of the no-kids, never-married male, but just the risk of divorce would quash the deal for me. A wise man once said, ‚ÄúWhen the dick grows hard, the mind grows soft.‚Äù üôÇ As regards the lower classes, widespread welfare destroyed whatever remained of the need for a traditional male in the home. Did the middle class really do much better?

                                    As I understand the stat‚Äôs from Murray‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúComing Apart‚Äù. The middle and lower middle classes are not doing very well in the traditional family department.  That‚Äôs in contrast to the upper middle and elite classes who have not readily abandoned traditional values such as marriage and family.
Not sure of cause and effect here, but in friends who have broken (or no families) families, I tend to note that they are/were also doing poorly economically at the time.

                                Possibly Jim. I can see a flip side to that: what kind of kids are raised by single parent mothers? 25% of all our mass murderers and criminals are from single parent families. And I have no firm numbers or data, but my anecdotal observation seems to be that over 80% of the remainder children ‚Äì go on to become marginal adults at best. What use in there in whelping morons and dysfunctional children? They can‚Äôt look after themselves, never mind our collective future‚Ä¶But as one of the others pointed out ‚Äì you can do everything right and fail, and do everything wrong and succeed. Having and raising kids is an emotional, divisive issue, especially for those of us that threw everything into their kids and lost. I suppose I am too biased to say anything useful on the subject.

                I have watched kids in our private school go from 3 years old to 8th grade for a long time. Some are like your kids and never gave any trouble at all. Some had great parents and some had bad parents. On the other hand, there were those who were bad apples from being a baby. And yes, some had good parents and some did not.
There is something in the DNA that contributes to these things. Damn, I‚Äôll say it. Genetics matters.

                I made lots of mistakes, James. In my defense, I was still on the other side of the great divide. I didn‚Äôt come here willingly. It was only after my daughter left home that I began to notice things and question them.We should have homeschooled ‚Äì but at the time our economy was in recession and we both had to work to make ends meet. We couldn‚Äôt afford the private schools either.The other thing that I would do over, if possible ‚Äì would be to move as far away from the family and in laws as possible. Especially my mother in law. She was a domineering (pardon me: ‚Äúpowerful and independent‚Äù) woman that knew everything. My father in law was a cucked peckerheaded boomer that wanted me as pussy whipped as he was. They were always involving themselves in our affairs and stirring up shit. Getting exiled from The Hive was a relief, and I made sure it went both ways. I didn‚Äôt want to see them again either.There are other things I could have done better ‚Ä¶ but hindsight is 20/20.

                The one piece of advice I now give to parents is, don‚Äôt stop with just one child. My wife and I did stop with one (tried for another, but we started too late I guess). He‚Äôs a great kid with a good heart, but the only child thing is very real. They are spoiled in more ways than I ever imagined.It‚Äôs not just the material stuff. Not having a younger sibling, he hasn‚Äôt learned the independence that comes when parents have to shift their attention to a baby. Not having an older sibling, he doesn‚Äôt have an example. It seems to me that the only child is a bit more needy and later to mature. There also seems to be increased difficulty making friends.There‚Äôs also the very real worry that when I and my wife pass away, he won‚Äôt have the close family ties that only immediate family have.So, if you have children, try your best to have at least two. I just think it‚Äôs better for everyone.

                    It is thought that much of the feminazi grift gripping the culture is due to small families bringing on great percentages of girls having no brothers.

                        I‚Äôm thinking it might also be from boys having no brothers. Brothers fight and learn to fight by fighting each other. Not too long ago, my young son started making some noise about wanting to fight a classmate. I reminded him that this classmate has an older brother, who isn‚Äôt exactly a nice guy, so he probably knows how to scrap better than my son. Of course, it made me realize that I need to find an outlet to teach him how to fight. Couldn‚Äôt hurt his hockey game either‚Ä¶

                        I would also add that boys growing up without sisters has blinded them to the reality of women. It is much, much easier to place a woman on a pedestal when you don‚Äôt know what she is really like.

            Obviously I can‚Äôt/shouldn‚Äôt  blame the victim here, but I‚Äôm just not feeling your dynamics as universally applicable.  My general memory of having and raising children was of myself and wife broaching no interference in upbringing and basically being in agreement.  Nor do I remember such problems occurring to the extent that bit you in the ass and ruined your daughter.  I will also say for the record that to the extent our kids are anything to talk about, it is to the fault/benefit of my wife.  She was a natural at this and took to raising them far above my skill level and had her priorities straight in that regard‚Äîoften to my selfish regret at the time.

            I know this opinion could be very unpopular here but I think‚Ä¶ spanking a child turns out bad for the child (except for maybe a necessary light swat on occasion around the age of two or three.)What the liberals always leave out is the other side of the coin, the need for something to replace spanking. Discipline your child yes, or you will have a little monster but there are ways to impose punishment without making it physical. Don‚Äôt be like the blacks and treat your children like dirt. I know this from first-hand experience.Young parents, take a parenting class if you come from that background of physical punishment as I and my wife did. Yes, it‚Äôs a progressive thing but they‚Äôre not wrong about everything. It will change your life for the better.

        Philadelphia is a lot like Baltimore in that sense.  It‚Äôs one of the oldest cities in the US with lots of great architecture.  There are parts of Philadelphia which used to be majestic.  Girard Avenue has some very beautiful 3 story rowhomes with elevated 2nd story porches with storefronts beneath them.  These were nice large homes with trolley lines serving them and a relatively short walk between them and center city.  But today they are just one big slum neglected into a completely sorry state of disrepair in a neighborhood where nobody is safe and all of the store fronts are either completely abandoned or covered in various states of jailhouse bars and grating.  There are some old mansions along the train stops which were once the suburbs of Philadelphia. The mansions have been parceled up into low rent apartments and the parks lining the other side littered with prostitution and needles.America‚Äôs cities, especially those on the East coast have some of the saddest histories.  Most have been destroyed in the last 80 years. They are one of the many losses we suffered because of World War 2.  It is like they all got hit with bombs and nobody bothered to fix the rubble.  Philadelphia has an elevated line called the Market Frankford line.  It goes through some of the old industrial sections of Philadelphia and passes under center city Philadelphia.  When you look out the windows during the elevated parts you see almost nothing but decay, graffiti and, strangely enough, there are even buildings so neglected there are trees growing out of the roofs.  Most of the store fronts are gone, boarded up, impossible to run because of crime keeping the customers away and break-ins at night. Both ends are loaded with prostitution and drug sales where the stores used to be.All of this beauty and practicality replaced by soulless suburbs because we are too cowardly to speak the truth and fix the damn problem.  The SJWs love to bitch about cars, but the reality is America needs cars because of them!  People left the city not because they hated city life. People love cities.  People left the cities because they were becoming their very own ‚ÄúLagos‚Äù

            Worst part is people think it‚Äôs inevitable. Even the burbs aren‚Äôt what they used to be.  The solutions are simple and obvious but too few have the stomach for it.  Much easier to cower, dodge accusations of racism, flee to some new subdivision in the countryside or a condo in some small city in the next county.
Funny, I was listening to JLP yesterday and he said it.  Talked about whites running and how the same people end up following them and recreating the mess. Said whites need to stand up. It was‚Ä¶ amazing!

            It would be a very long shot, but if one could invest in some of the classical architecture and hold for, um, several decades, perhaps things might improve. Growing up around DC, I witnessed  (at a distance, mercifully) the decay from 1960s for a few decades. But in past twenty years or so DC has had quite the gentrification, probably the most in the country. I‚Äôd say odds are against my investing idea, but DC does show that sometimes an area can come back. I‚Äôm still waiting for world on what might encourage middle-class whites to move back to America‚Äôs once-great cities üòÄ

        The danger for some of us coming into the dissident movement and I include myself in this is that we never noticed much about the little hats that was destructive before.Now we notice it.But we can get to carried away with it and I am guilty of this myself.Getting carried to far into little hat theories  is not productive to us in the long run.Just as the Trumpsters always coming up with an excuse for why Trump doesn‚Äôt do what he is supposed to do on policywe can see little hats behind everything.Trump does some good things but the Trumpsters can be blind to his failings.The problem with the little hats and what those wise among them should be concerned about it is that their bad actors are really sticking out now. It‚Äôs much easier to see the little hats doing bad things than it should be for them .From Epstein to Weinstein to Weismann it‚Äôs a bad look.But to go too far with noticing little hats is unproductive for us.It becomes obsessive and creates in us a negative identity much like the Black‚Äôs relationship to whites.The Z is right about this.

            One of the tricks of doing Littlehatology is that even when it is the little hats (which is often) you look like a lunatic, especially to the center-right people we need to bring on board if we want to win, if you talk about it all the time.
The art is to do Littlehatology without getting swallowed up by it.

                    I can understand an initial explosion from people. For most of us, there‚Äôs a six-month period or so when we realize that:1. We‚Äôve been lied to all our lives;2. Those lies are destroying our people and already have destroy what was our country;3. A small group of people from another tribe have been the driving force behind those lies;4. That group pretends to be a part of our group even as it works to destroy us;5. We can lose everything if we even talk about those lies (and that same group is the one behind the punishment).That‚Äôs a lot to digest in a short amount of time and creates a lot of anger, which it should.That said, you have to come out that stage and realize that the Little Hats aren‚Äôt the cause of all our problems (the con artist needs a willing mark), and they‚Äôre not omnipotent. They‚Äôre just a another tribe with strengths and weaknesses trying improve things for their group.

            Absolutely right. There are nationalist blacks that think whitey is behind everything. Then there‚Äôs nationalist whites that think Jews are behind everything. I‚Äôll quote Mike Enoch of all people, who says ‚Äújust say no to (((them)))‚Äù and then paraphrase John Derbyshire who says whites are more to blame for allowing the 2% to dictate the livelihood of the 70%, if the antisemitic allegations are correct.

        Even assuming they are harmless lunatics, like the guy in drag claiming to be Bambi.
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a harmless lunatic. He‚Äôs busy trying to destroy Twitch. Like the other mentally ill man dressed as a woman who has taken over the open source movement, these lunatics also tend to be obsessive and devote endless energy to their projects. Since it is impossible for a company‚Äôs official position to be ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a lunatic, go away,‚Äù they wear institutions down through their persistence.

            Destroying twitch would be a service to the world and more than we could ever hope this lunatic could accomplish.  Personally, I just cannot understand what people like about it. You go watch other people play video games or women thoting for subscriptions.
IMHO, twitch is one of the signs of how rotten everything is.

        Interesting discussion about long-term goals. I get caught up in that as well ‚Äì to my detriment.Looks like Z Man has taken up Trend Following as a life strategy, which we should all consider. Normally, trend following is associated with investing, but it‚Äôs really just a general philosophy and an effective one.Its principles consist of:1)         Try a number of paths2)         Ride the winners3)         Cut you losses4)         Manage your riskOften people/businesses have a grandiose plan with one big goal in mind. They then pore massive amounts of resources and time into that plan. If it starts to falter, they pore even more resources into it trying to make it work. Finally, after years of failure, they finally give up.The better plan is to try a number of things in a much smaller way with only a vague outline of what you think it will lead to. Keep going with those endeavors that are working and cut bait on those that aren‚Äôt. (Btw, there‚Äôs nothing that says you can‚Äôt try them later if you think the time is ripe to see if they might work under different circumstances.)Don‚Äôt get caught up in why some things are working and why others aren‚Äôt. Just follow the trend(s) to see where it/they will lead. It all likelihood, you‚Äôll end up in a place you never expected, but you‚Äôll have achieved the most.Keep moving forward making small bets. Stick with what works. Cut out things that don‚Äôt work. Rinse and repeat.

        I told my brother when he reached thirty (he‚Äôs 60 now) that he needs to go places where the women who want to get married are, like church. He didn‚Äôt and is childless. Men didn‚Äôt used to require their wives to share their philosophy. Rich, educated men used to marry their secretaries, and went to church with their wives even if they weren‚Äôt believers. It wasn‚Äôt just the teenage girls who changed in the ‚Äô80s.

        This humble commenter thinks completing the book is far better than any sort of video, especially if you can make it an audiobook.  I sent my normie, Reagan-loving father ‚ÄúAge of Entitlement‚Äù, which was perfect for where he is.  I have a lot of colleagues who are in about the same place.
A book from you would be just the right amount of wrong-think to get potential dissidents to the next level.

        Zman, I really appreciated your comments about Lagos. Having spent some time there in the past, I too was struck by its profound architectural beauty, but also saddened and enraged over how badly blacks have destroyed that city. Even in neighborhoods that have been mostly abandoned and overgrown you could see the lingering architectural beauty, much like you would in the ruins of a castle in Europe.Various dissident right people have commented on this many times, but perhaps one of the things fueling black-on-white violence in these cities ‚Äî and the corresponding black-on-white hatred on college campuses ‚Äî is a deep subconscious understanding on the part of blacks that, contrary to everything they‚Äôve been told, they‚Äôve actually been given MORE than whites have ever been given, and still have failed spectacularly. So in the case of cities like Lagos or Philly, they were given majestic top-of-the-line white neighborhoods, and plenty of cold hard cash and other gibs to live comfortably in those neighborhoods, yet they‚Äôve ruined them so spectacularly that those neighborhoods are now reverting to old-growth forest. It takes a special kind of stunning incompetence to accomplish that ‚Äî even whites with the entire steel industry ripped away from them never turned Pittsburgh into that kind of third world shithole.Deep down, the blacks rampaging on their periodic flash mobs and flash robs understand that they‚Äôre abject failures, and this causes them to attack white people. It must be terrifying to come to terms with the fact that you can be given every benefit and leg up in the world only to realize that despite all that, you will still fail and never be able to compete due to biology. There‚Äôs no possible way to psychologically overcome that unless you can once more be separated into your own community to look after your own kind, rather than being forced to compete against an alien community that has expectations you‚Äôll never be able to meet.You see the same thing on the college campus ‚Äî there‚Äôs less violence, but the black-on-white hatred that seeps into the MSM and social media is born of a deep subconscious understanding that blacks who have been forced into these white institutions will never be able to compete, fueling ever deeper resentment of whites.Leftism has grown more unhinged because it has finally realized that integration has failed, but it hasn‚Äôt yet figured out how to come to terms with this reality. Scratch behind the MSM and social media, and a surprisingly high proportion of leftists are race realists. I can confirm Zman‚Äôs observations about most of white Lagos being race realists ‚Äî back when I was there I discovered that while whites may have put on an ‚ÄúI love vibrancy‚Äù public face, once you got talking to the same people one-on-one or in smaller groups, they were as race realist as John Derbyshire. All of them had given Derb‚Äôs version of ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù to their kids, family, and friends.

        Funny to hear about the whole Gen-Xer no kids thing ‚Äì it seemed to happen over the span of one afternoon that everyone agreed children were the worst possible thing.I listened to Springsteen‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe River,‚Äù the other day and was thinking about how odd it seems now and how, in 1980, it perfectly captured how all the kids felt. How strange: a sad ballad about how a guy spent a couple years shagging his tasty girlfriend, knocks her up, gets married, and then the community provides him with lifetime employment so he can raise his family. But he sings it like it‚Äôs a complete catastrophe.‚ÄúThen I got Mary pregnant and, man, that was all she wrote. For my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat.‚ÄùBut that was the spirit of the age: a family means your life is over, family is death. Is it any wonder that the subsequent generations figured that, if you‚Äôre supposed to live before you die, it would be better simply to skip the dying part?My wife bought in to it, as well. ‚ÄúOh, no. No children.‚Äù Fortunately, we were reckless and had two, but it was years before we properly understood what had happened was, well, grace.

        When I first read the title of this I thought it would be about Karens, didn‚Äôt everyone else? üôÇ Since the myopic self-as-the-center-of-the-universe worldview has infected most western wahmen from teenage to menopause at this point sadly. But to just riff off your actual topic perhaps you should try a ‚Äòproof of concept‚Äô live stream. I see very clearly you have an interest in it so as they say, it can‚Äôt hurt to try.What I -would- say is you attempt to come at it from a different angle bynotmaking it about you. This would have two main benefits 1) Something different and perhaps interesting for that reason alone which would also potentially make you stand out in a crowded playing field and provide a niche 2) Would probably appeal to your established audience more. I get that livestream is where the big money is and do not at all begrudge you for wanting a slice of that too. It is nice to not have to grind out a paycheck most of which goes to Leviathan and globohomo corps that hate your guts.Lastly, I remembered why even though I‚Äôm in Sodom on Potomac I don‚Äôt visit nearby Bal‚Äômer often.‚Äù The locals would be looking forward to a long weekend of shooting at one another. Gun play is still possible.‚ÄùHilarious! True, funny and sad simultaneously.

        Must say I am disappointed that Z man  doesn‚Äôt think it is necessary for our people to marry before they propagate while opining in the next breath that no fault divorce has been terrible for white (and black) families. No self-respecting DR movement can or should have a blind spot to the serious evil that broken, ununified homes and illegitimacy have had on our community and society. Our movement must encourage lasting, fruitful marriage based on mutual love and support if we are to get anywhere. Fortunately, I think Z is a reasomable enough guy to see the error in his statement and to change his mind, or at least clarify that he didn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúas long as she is white, get her pregnant, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if you marry her.‚Äù

        It‚Äôs always fun watching middle and upper-class blacks trying to relate to and draw no distinctions between themselves and their children and Travon Martin, Freddie Grey, Mike Brown and now the Jogging man.It really is fun watching them justify the appalling behavior of these guys and pretend the only reason they are dead is because they are black and that they themselves are one ‚Äòagitated white guy‚Äô away from being killed in the streets for driving while black or jogging while or just generally living while black.Even among the white nationalist types, we just don‚Äôt see this behavior.  If some white guy wins a Darwin award making a nuisance of himself, he becomes an object of ridicule and not a fellow to be defended at any cost.Great show today.  Z might be able to make a live stream work occasionally. But the main problem with the live stream format is there just isn‚Äôt enough to talk about for several hours every day, sometimes twice a day and so it always devolves into personal squabbles with fellow live-streamers. The superchats always devolve into a shit show.  If you only do it occasionally, there might be enough reasonable questions to fill a 90 minute stream.

            I understand completely why middle and upper class blacks respond this way. Even if they can‚Äôt articulate it this way, a ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù black mom knows her kids will be just as violent and dysfunctional as the people she left behind in the ghetto.One or two isolated ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù black kids in the suburbs may be able to have their most extreme impulses managed by their white friends, but as soon as you get a critical mass of black kids in the suburbs, you get the same behavior that you see in the ghetto. This is because the behavior comes from biology, not class or culture.So while a ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù black woman may not be able to articulate it this way, she knows instinctually that she and her kids bring the ghetto with them wherever they go. They‚Äôre not safe just because they‚Äôre in the suburbs. Wherever they go, they know they may be forced to account for their uncontrollable children.The black ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù is an artificial construction anyway. It‚Äôs just the ghetto transplanted into ranch houses. A long time ago The Woodpile Report pointed out that 60% of this ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù is employed by government.

                It‚Äôs more complicated than that.  The black middle class is on average smarter and less violent than blacks in the ghetto. They are on average more violent than whites of the same IQ though. Their kids tend to be closer to the racial average than they are (the same is true for whites) via reversion to the mean.But my point is that they know the behavior is appalling and indefensible.  And while it may be funny to watch them squirm, at the bottom of it all is hatred of white people.  It is very easy to ascribe the bad behavior to the people you don‚Äôt like.

                    One of the first things to wake me up to race realism was the discovery that wealthy blacks were more murderous than poor whites, and that the kids of wealthy blacks were more violent than the kids of poor whites.

                        This explains why Washington‚Äôs suburban Prince George‚Äôs County, which is full of wealthy black government workers and MBE contractors, is still more violent than poor white West Virginia.
Even if a mom wants to take her kids out of the ghetto, nature is relentless and remorseless: most kids regress to the thug lyfe.

                            PG County, back when I grew up in Montgomery County in the ‚Äô60s-‚Äô70s, was lower middle-class/working-class Whites.  The so-called ‚Äúmiddle class blacks‚Äù who moved in and took it over absolutely destroyed it.  The entire ‚Äúmiddle-class black‚Äù thing is a myth.  Income does not alter genetics.  Even half White admixture is generally not enough to overcome sub-Saharan genetics and life outcomes.

                Pity the Talented Tenth Blacks (at least a little): they‚Äôve made it into a semblance of the middle class (quite likely with a genrous helping of affirmative action and quotas). Then they have kids. Those darn genetics kick in. Even with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (White people) the sad fact is that kids rarely turn out as successful as the parents (unless the parents are average!).  The best thing that wealthier Blacks can hope for is to isolate their spawn from the worst elements of their race, for as long as possible.

        A quick TRS comment, I‚Äôm sure there are others.  I think you may be dismissing the generational aspect of it.  There‚Äôs a big difference between Gen Xers who were children of the 70s and came of age in the 80s vs. ones who were children of the 80s who came of age in the 90s.  We all experienced the cultural wrecking ball, but yours being 10 years older than our age group.  Our experience was even more catastrophic, and created people even more reactionary.  I find their AOC monetary policy the most laughable, and yes, they have Jew on the brain,  but I enjoy their rage and lashing out, especially at Republicans.  I also enjoy Paul Ramsey and Derbyshire, but as boomers, they‚Äôre even more mellow and sanguine than you are.  Intellectual coherency aside, raw rage counts of a lot in these times.  They‚Äôre dissidents too, but you have pre-Nirvana dissidents and post-Nirvana dissidents.

        Z basically describes a female gab-fest party from decades ago as being the way both news and entertainment works today. Those were not his exact words, but that is what I got of of the post.The total fraud of the Corona virus panic is a prime example. All kinds of women on TV telling people we would all DIE if we did not hide in our bedrooms. And hid alone! Kick the mate out, he/she might infect us!We will never have a decent society again unless men take back control. Damn, I sound like Archie Bunker.

        I was gonna say, Lagos is probably the most advanced all African city.Does z find baltimoreans to be race realist?  I live in a similar southeastern city and I find that most are delusional on race.  Right around where I live there have been the most heinous shootings and murders, but the white populace seems oblivious.  News reports are brief and sketchy and often to get the full story on what really happened, you have to know the people involved.  Some are standard mugging, but some have unclear or random motives.A couple of years back, a high profile woman was shot in a mugging near my house, and when I would talk to people about it, multiple times they would say stuff like ‚Äúnow she resisted, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù As if she deserved it for resisting arrest or something, lol!  Come to think of it, how could anyone know what really happened because she was killed?  Delusional I tell you!

        Z on why he didn‚Äôt have kids resonated with me.  I‚Äôm of Z‚Äôs generation, but younger and better looking.
In the 70s-80s, the message everywhere was that marriage was for suckers.  My parents, bless them, stayed together while half of my friends‚Äô parents divorced.
I guess that my parents wondered if they would be happier if they were single and childless  I guess my Dad imagined he‚Äôd be having lots of sex with liberated women and my Mom imagined she‚Äôd be a CEO.
I absorbed the message that marriage and kids were for suckers and didn‚Äôt unlearn it until recently.

        Another Gen-X‚Äôer here.  I just took a quick inventory of guys who were really good friends of mine, from Kindergarten through our early 20‚Äôs ‚Äî we‚Äôre all in our late 40‚Äôs/early 50‚Äôs now.   I came up with 11 who didn‚Äôt get married or married then divorced, and 4 who had gotten married and stayed married, although one of them, soon to be married 25 years, never had kids.  The group of 4 also contained my lone Jewish friend for whatever that‚Äôs worth.We all grew up in a heavily Catholic rust belt town.  Thinking back, I believe all 15 of us had a two parent home, with no divorce involved, and we all had siblings.  Further, I bet many of them look back to our formative years very, very fondly.  What the hell went wrong?As for your friend who talked about becoming a parent late in life, I have to say that‚Äôs a fairly selfish thing to do.  Besides the uncertainty of mortality, the fact that you might not be around to finish raising your child, there are certain parenting activities that require a modicum of youth.  I had my lone child at 43 and I‚Äôd say I just made it under the wire.  I‚Äôm thankful that intellectually it‚Äôs the not the me of my 20‚Äôs raising my daughter, but physically I‚Äôm not so sure.  My parents had their three kids by the time they were 28 and I‚Äôm convinced this is the way to go.  I‚Äôd have probably red-pilled much earlier if I‚Äôd had children.

                When they showed me my daughter for the first time, an incredibly powerful feeling of tranquility came over me quite unexpectedly.

I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs possible to have that feeling without beholding your own progeny.

        To what end? For what purpose? Dissident marketplace or dissident think tank? It looks like there are quite a few higher I.Q. Individuals thinking from a dissident perspective. The best designs are done over time. Proper dissident perspective is a skill developed over time but must have at its core a certain Je ne sais quoi. Being smarter than the average bears helps.

        I‚Äôve never had any patience for livestreaming. Wrong generation, I guess. The signal to noise ratio is so very low. So much rambling. I remember I went to watch a Nick Fuentes livestream after the fact (after it was finished and posted) right about the time that he was tormenting Charlie Kirk and the rest of his group on their speaking tour and I was curious who he was. The stream had a half hour of empty air at the beginning (before he eventually showed up, which I think is just plain rude. Apparently it is common). I made what I thought was an innoccent comment that it would have been nice if he trimmed off the dead air before posting and got absolutely ripped apart. Apparently in the streaming culture, stuff like that is just expected. Gave me a bad taste of the kind of people who follow Fuentes.

                I am very sorry to insult but younger people like to get united and get something done.  Not absurd fight about music or optics or endless fierce bullshit what one or another worn mean or what is better, duginism, bullshitism hamsterism or whattaboutism. This is the main problem about intellectuualism. Richard Spender and Amren and Scandza were thrown out from Eastern Europe because of this. They demoralize the youth. Build strong pro normal people movement, drive the to power, remove liberals and close the borders. Nothing intellectual , irrational dysfunctional, white national or homosexual. Of course, there may be endless discussion what is more important, Hegelian or Ballsrachian but those debates drive every normal person away.

        Just read that CNN pundits were kicking around the idea of having lockdown protesters waive their medical coverage. Yeah, it‚Äôs a fluff sesh, but the mere suggestion is annoying to me. They lobbed a few loaded questions to some ponce doctor about how protesters are ‚Äúpotentially inflicting death upon their communities.‚Äù Shame!Honestly, I think that big healthcare and the medical insurance covens (mostly women) have a lot of nerve to tell us about propriety or endangering lives when they‚Äôre charging 600 dollars for a 30-day supply of insulin. What‚Äôs even funnier, they‚Äôre generously ‚Äúdiscounting it [insulin] due to the current crisis.‚Äù Thanks, guys, for charging 60 dollars ‚Äî nearly double the normal rate of insulin in most other countries ‚Äî during a crisis. If every other company on earth can cope with merely quadrupling their profits, why can‚Äôt Eli Lily?

        Your content is basically great, but one suggestion is to chop up your podcast into individual videos. You don‚Äôt even need real ‚Äúvideo‚Äù, just one photo per segment.
People will be less intimidated by the 5 and 10 minute run times. Also, the ‚Äúclassics‚Äù can go viral, and be seen for many years after they‚Äôve been released.
As it is now, they‚Äôre ‚Äúlocked up‚Äù in the longer podcasts, and only very hardy or hardcore listeners will binge-watch whole podcasts from years before.
Just a thought.

        While I don‚Äôt know if expanding into video would be necessary, or even necessarily desirable, your audience estimates are probably off.  I think as general populace IQ declines the dependency on video is increasing greatly.  The video I consume generally are podcasts that use the image mostly just to show supporting material that require only occasional glances at the screen; it‚Äôs handy as a podcast playback system that can be speed adjusted so slow talkers aren‚Äôt so boring.Just as a point of comparison, Dan Bongino‚Äôs YouTube channel has just over 400k subscribers and his daily podcast video has about 150k views within its first 24 hours.  From what I can find the NYT‚Äôs website has about 200k unique visitors a month.

        Hands down best comment section,I used to look forward to FTN especially the deep dives when ethnarch was involved.I suspect habersham may have left due to jazzhands increasingly shrill tirades ‚Äúorange faggot‚Äù &amp; such.I believe halbershram was a moderating influence.I thought it was good of them to give alsup job as he is a local boy (pnw) I had participated in an action at the UW with alsup &amp; I was impressed at the time.After a few weeks it became apparent FTN was just going to be a JH rage fest, I‚Äôve tried to listen a couple times since but have turned it off.Ill just kick the  bucks I used to pay them over to Z man. As I lost interest in TDS a year ago.

            Ethnarch was the one from whom I heard about the Zman when he mentioned the blog back when he would guest-host FTN. Since then, I have been a daily reader. I miss Ethnarch‚Äôs opinions and commentary. He gave great bookrecommendations, too. If he is reading this, I am a big fan!

        Mr. Z, kind of off on a tangent, but the title of today‚Äôs podcast brought to mind a song by Toby Keith, ‚ÄúI Wanna Talk About Me‚Äù.  While I realize you don‚Äôt really wanna, it‚Äôs kind of funny and tongue in cheek.  Don‚Äôt know if you enjoy country music, but you did end last week‚Äôs podcast with a good Charlie Daniels song that I doubt I‚Äôve heard in 45 years!  Bravo!

        Interesting observation between video consumption vs. IQ level.  While I am no genius hate the fact the local news website has every story linked to a video. I mean it‚Äôs all videos !Just trying to read a quick forecast brings up some over animated weathermen.  After several futile attempts to kill the pop up I just sit there and listen to ‚ÄúMom‚Äù tell me about wearing sunblock and bringing  jacket for the cool evening temperatures. Now you can even watch TV while pumping gas.  Really is starting to turn into some kind of science fiction movie.Feel your pain about not having kids . Was too overcautious watching friends get married , have kids, get divorced and fight over the children. Finally found a decent mate, but alas we‚Äôre both too old.   As far as living in a black community ?  Well, I was one of the last holdouts in my old neighborhood.Dealing with criminals all day and then coming home having to live next to them just became too much.  Think once you move out of that area you‚Äôll be much happier and going back to visit realize just how crazy it was living in that environment.  Lastly, can understand natural curiosity, but your personal life it‚Äôs none of my business.  Enjoy the blog and that‚Äôs good enough for me.P,S. Have sent a couple of checks . Hope you‚Äôve got them. Keep up the good work. Looking forward to the book.

        I was born in the DC area (DC actually!) and lived much of my life in South Lagos (No. VA). Many times in my 20s and 30s I would day-trip up to Baltimore. It did have its charms, the Inner Harbor, a bike ride around the city, etc. I think it‚Äôs deteriorated a bit in the past twenty years, and I doubt I‚Äôd be brave enough to go there any more. One thing that suprised me: I would note the decrepit old ‚ÄúDomino Sugar‚Äù sign when driving on the interstate.  ‚ÄúA remnant of long ago, in Baltimore‚Äôs industrial heyday‚Äù I though to myself.

        I can relate to your disappointment with TRS and associated acts. I‚Äôve generally backed away from dissident politics as well. It seems most of what used to be known as the alt-right has morphed into socialists that don‚Äôt like minorities. They‚Äôre perfectly happy with the welfare state, they just want redirect the benefits away from minorities to white people.This is a good example why few in the mainstream right, conservative/libertarian normies,  have little reason to be interested in the dissidents. Think about the message here. They‚Äôre basically getting told what the dissidents will give them is a better class of parasites to support.Yeah, I guess that‚Äôs not nothing, but not exactly a reason to storm the barricades, either. I understand that people like the TRS guys and Richard Spencer are tired of being known as the Evil Racists, and want to talk about something else. The problem is when they talk about anything else, it becomes obvious how woefully unprepared they are to be running a political movement. They should stick to being Evil Racists. It‚Äôs the one topic they can discuss with any degree of competence.

            I would not call TRS dissident right. They just hate Jews. It is what defines them entirely now. I‚Äôm old enough to remember their act in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs. They are Stormfront, The Podcast. That‚Äôs fine. They should be free to do that material. It‚Äôs just not what I‚Äôm into or in any way dissident right. In fact, they have made that clear on many occasions, so I‚Äôm not breaking new ground here. it‚Äôs just an acknowledgement of reality.

A lot of people seem to making that connection. There was a long post tweeted out by Greg Johnson claiming that the old alt-right was orchestrating some sort of NazBol rebrand. I skimmed it:https://twitter.com/NewRightAmerica/status/1263266975326838784
I don‚Äôt know enough to pass judgement on that claim, but there has been a clear change in direction that seems coordinated.

I am not sure what Duginism is, but surely a summary of the entire belief system ought to take half that many words.  Or less.
I prefer Hofferism:

                                As I said in the show, I tend to view verbosity as an insult.
Not everyone has your gift for keeping it brief lol Some smart guy once said ‚ÄúI didnt have time to write you a short letter so I wrote you a long one‚Äù. Some dont have the mental horsepower to distill so they send you the raw material, w all the noise still there. That said, succinct, clear and brief are the three corners of elegance.

                                Having now read the article I have a few observations to make:
1.   The Alt RIght has become a pro-wrestling match in which the kayfabe has been scripted by PKD.
2.  I am still not sure what Duginism is, but my spidey sense tells me it is simply a less entertaining form of Zizekism.  That is to say enervating Contintental pseudo-intellectual shaggy dog bullshit.
3.  Feels bad man for Seventh Son.

I would like to think that this fight is over whether or not one thinks handing state power to an African lesbian (or mulatta cop, or Choctaw princess, etc.) during a global pandemic and economic depression would produce a good outcome for white people.
What I have noticed is that no one on this side is talking about action in the public space any more.  It seems that anyone acting in the public space (the open-it-up crowd, for example) recieves the sort of criticism that used to be reserved for the SJWs.

                The TRS guys may hate jews.  Another interpretation is that they are not distracted by the small number of jews who are not anti-white.  TRS is dealing with jews as a totality.  It‚Äôs like having a realistic view of blacks as a totality despite Thomas Sowell and Clarence Thomas.

                    Yet Sowell and Thomas are general recognized as rare examples of human genius, regardless of their status as the ‚Äútalented-trillionth‚Äù for blacks. The TRS folks have displayed in the past many difficulties accepting incontrovertible Jewish contributions to anything. Amazingly, I‚Äôm not even including Mike Enoch in that cadre. This threat they‚Äôre treating as a totality is actually a small minority TRS has admitted in the past is the most active. Ironically, being so black-pilled they‚Äôve pigeonholed themselves into a place where they‚Äôre no longer a threat.

                    Mike Enoch has said on many occasions that he hates Jews. He hates them in the particular and in the generality. I think he should be free to hate who he likes and do so publicly. Further, I‚Äôm unwilling to soften his message or interpret in some way to make it less explicit. I take him at his word.Not to put too fine a point on it, but he has said on many occasions that he wants Israel destroyed and all Jews removed from white countries. Without being asked, he says he does not care if they have no where to go. You don‚Äôt have to be too clever to understand what is being implied. He considers Jews to be the mortal enemy of white people and all of his politics flows from that axiom.As I have repeatedly said, he should be free to hold such positions. I‚Äôm unwilling to play make believe and pretend he is making a novel or thoughtful critique. William Pierce and Revilo Oliver made all the same arguments fifty years ago. In other words, I know this material cold and I‚Äôm seeing things clearly. I‚Äôm not misunderstanding anything.

                        Jews are &lt;3% of the U.S. population.  We do not need them here.  They are the richest per-capita minority on the planet.  I don&#x27;t care where they go either.  They don&#x27;t need us to look out for them.  They can ask one of their many, many billionaire co-ethnics to worry about that.Were you this concerned about the stronger rhetoric that was used against Blacks in the recent post here about Aubery?  Is Jared Taylor or Paul Kersey&#x27;s position on Blacks any more &quot;extreme&quot; than Enoch or TRS in general on Jews?I agree with all of these men on all of these races, for what it&#x27;s worth.  But it seems that position is incompatible with the new fashionable brands in style this season.

                    LineInSand, ‚Äúhating‚Äù a group is not the same as ‚Äúhaving a realistic view‚Äù of that group. It is not a ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate [all] Jews.‚Äù Why? Because NAJALT. Nor is it a ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù when one does not ‚Äúhate [all] blacks‚Äù because NABALT (as you noted yourself). A ‚Äúrealistic view‚Äù makes sense; chaining oneself to some group via undifferentiated hostility towards them does not, even if that group mayon balancebe malignant.

                        Fair point.  I respect your outlook.  Personally, I have found that making grand gestures to show that you acknowledge that not all jews are our enemies does not actually yield any advantage.  Maybe your experience will be different.
Honestly, I acknowledge that there are jews who are not our enemies,  but from my experience, it is a distinction without a difference.

                            Sand Line, I gotta respond with respect: It is not a mere ‚Äúgrand gesture‚Äù to note that ‚Äúall Jews are not our enemies.‚Äù It is an acknowledgement of reality (one that apparently needs to be repeated in certain environs). Making sure we are not chained to an observably false reality is always beneficial. (I must emphasize also that I don‚Äôt deny the statistical reality of ‚Äúon balance‚Äù truths, which are undeniably significant.)

                    ‚ÄúThe Right Stuff‚Äù  5 years ago they started a blog and a podcast as racially aware libertarians who opposed immigration and affirmative action.  They attracted a big audience because many people found them funny and insightful.  Their positions have evolved towards pro-white advocacy, ‚Äúantisemitism,‚Äù socialism, and Modern Monetary Theory.  Mike Enoch Peinovich is the leader.  Many of their podcasts require a paid membership, from which a few of them make a living.  They are a big deal in the pro-white world.

                Z, since being anti-Semitic is so clearly not a part of being ‚Äúdissident right,‚Äù how do you define ‚Äúdissident right‚Äù today versus last year when you appeared on TRS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFash the Nation‚Äù and the TRS-friendly ‚ÄúMyth of the 20th Century?‚Äù  Is the admirably anti-Semitic ‚ÄúRebel Yell‚Äù podcast of Identity Dixie ‚Äì where last week‚Äôs ‚ÄúPower Hour‚Äù is on page 1 ‚Äì part of the ‚Äúdissident right?‚ÄùI‚Äôd bother to mention that the TRS guys are considerably younger than you or I am, or point out that their network is probably newer than this blog, but you‚Äôll just tell me you were joking about the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs rather than trying to give the misleading impression that TRS is some legacy WN 1.0 outfit.If you‚Äôre talking Stormfront, that‚Äôs early 1990‚Äôs, not the 70‚Äôs or 80‚Äôs.As for anti-Semitism in general, that‚Äôs obviously a bit older.

            You‚Äôre absolutely correct. The Alt-Right‚Äôs embrace of big government repels a lot of potential recruits. Additionally, many of them have proven  complete cucks on this virus hysteria. Richard Spencer is such a self-destructive twit that he might as well be a Fed. The Alt-Right‚Äôs ideas tend to look like little more than adverse reactions to mainstream conservatism. Hunter Wallace is an especially glaring example of that. Beyond that, whatever leadership they have shows no grasp of public relations at all. Say what you will about Nick Fuentes ‚Äî he‚Äôs a lot more grounded than some of these other clowns.

                    That‚Äôs fine as long as it is clear it is a hypothetical to make a point and not a real set of choices. I think the critique of Team NazBol in this virus panic is that a) they spent years saying you can‚Äôt trust the media and now they suddenly believe every word and b) they spent years claiming our greatest ally runs the government and now they want to state to have unlimited power.

A good weekend to you.The big issue for my little world is lining up buying a cow critter to slaughter this fall to fill the freezer. Am learning to can beef in Ball jars and lay aside cases of canned beef, and looking to buy a freeze drier to fulfill goal of 6 months of beef (frozen-canned-freeze dried) as the broken supply chains bump along. I eat only beef-salt-water. The lyme is gone, 55 #s gone (like instrumentation-the bod reached a set point and stopped at my 27 YO weight), skin nice, no body pain At All. Dancing up and down my stairs, walking daily, my life is sweet, happy and respectful husband. This is deep keto Carnivore for those of us with trashed immune systems. Also hugely lowers inflammation, which is the cytokine storm mechanism that takes out people with the Chicom flu. Just saying!

                                        The Nordic affluence experienced under socialism is really quite a recent thing, and the socialism followed the creation of wealth. 19th century Nordics were quite poor. They are by no means immune the the wreakage that socialism brings to family formation and everything that sustains a civilization, and their clock too is running out.

                                            Well I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs tons of advanced structures from as early as the 16th century in Denmark so I‚Äôm little skeptical of your claim.What I can see is that most European countries were able to prosper under feudalism, monarchy, socialist-lite, and capitalist systems. Which tells me that the key ingredient is a population of high IQ, industrious people. They can make anything work. While places like Africa can‚Äôt make any system work. Even East Germany was many times wealthier than African nations despite an absurd government.While socialism may be absurd it is not the prime driver in making a good country to live in- certainly not to the extent we‚Äôve been led to believe. It was merely the only thing we were allowed to think about because biology was removed from the Overton window. But it seems clear to me biology is a much bigger factor. And the Nordic countries are far better places to live than most of the cities in the United States despite their economic policy.

                    Paintersforms, interesting question.http://www.consentfactory.orgis written by a hard leftie, that has gotten to roughly the same place we have on a lot of particulars, even though the underlying philosophy is completely different.  I get the feeling that there really is no easy way to put things together in a way that is both internally completely consistent, or that would be popular enough to be picked up by Normie.  We must simply chip away at things with what we know and understand, and we will find situational agreements about particulars, with those coming from other places.It is interesting to me how a couple of assumptions, such as that the elites are running things for their own benefit, and that the voting and other elements of democracy in our society are simply a facade covering something else entirely, quickly bring people to the same conclusions on a lot of things, even though they follow completely different underlying philosophies.

            I haven‚Äôt listened to the podcast yet, but Spencer and the TRS guys aren‚Äôt doing what needs to done, which is getting the patriotic, flag-waving folks on our side.  I‚Äôm sure they think of these people as ‚Äúfake and gay‚Äù or ‚Äúcringe‚Äù or some other contrarian novelty take.  They‚Äôve blown past trying to recruit American patriots to help stop importing the third world and keeping manufacturing at home, etc, and are off into some delusional new type of government which will have zero appeal to almost everyone. I‚Äôm sure they sneer at people like Fuentes, or Vince from Red Elephants, Vdare, or Jason (No White Guilt) or even Michelle Malkin and their attempts to appeal to ordinary patriotic American people.

            TRS and the Jews.  Right train wrong track.The only thing worst than their current tack would be ignoring the JQ. Holocaust denialism after 7 decades of brainwashing is self-defeating. Holocaust weaponization against the West would be a more productive tack.  Describe Jewish group interests and how they differ and conflict with Western interests and values in a few paragraphs. As an example focus upon the fevered dreams about the Holocaust coming out of Hollywood and how they are like everything else that comes out of Hollywood, an endless anti-White psyops working in favor of non Western group interests.  Add a few examples without getting lost in the weeds. Then treat it as axiomatic and go from there. Painting Jews as evil manipulators automatically sets off visions of dancing NAZIs in the Western imagination.  Decades of hard wiring won‚Äôt be undone with spergy guided tours through Auschwitz-Birkenau.From there means‚Ä¶how it has altered and weakened Western peoples and thus the civilization through the corruption of our tangible and intangible commons.  Focus on the damage done and not on the perps.  People will naturally have more of an interest in how events affect them than on what motivates the actions of an enemy.  Any venom should be aimed at traitors, especially the well-heeled ones.  Point out the treason they have committed against the civilizational building of their grandfathers, great-grandfathers and their 1000 generation ancestral lines. Point out the murder they are committing against their born, yet-to-be-born, never-to-be-born, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and the end to an eons old ancestral inheritance. Treason and genocide for 30 pieces of silver, others for power, others for a decadent form of false morality. Many are clueless clowns who are too easily manipulated. Others are manipulated by having falsehoods played upon their nobler virtues. Focus on ‚Äúus‚Äù not the ‚Äúother‚Äù.Maybe I‚Äôm naive but I don‚Äôt see anything coordinated. I see men from younger generations who have been damaged in many ways.  They are reacting to a correct enemy in the wrong way and in so doing are letting the bigger picture and better opportunities get away from them.  My enemy‚Äôs enemy had a funny little mustache so I‚Äôll  play that card and overplay it and overplay it and ‚Ä¶Every faction of the dissident movement wants the same thing: Westerners in control of their own destiny in white ethnic nations free of non-white group demands and interference.   The only turf war we should be engaged in is the one to protect the turf that runs from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic to the Volga.

                    The Visegrad countries are worthy of tremendous respect. I wish they were not in the EU, but they at least don‚Äôt seem to be as corrupted by that organization as the other members. But, yes, Visegrad could be an analogue to what I, and many other dissident rightists, have in mind for North America.

        In regards to the TRS types, I‚Äôd like to see our own coalition of the fringes.I agree, though, what is needed is not to persuade or convince, but to first find mutual agreement.  That‚Äôs why people talk in the first place.Me and the Christians think each other has it bass-akwards, but we‚Äôve arrived at the same place.  The Tribulation is here.What the Christians don‚Äôt quite get is that many of the figures in the Book- Adam and the Snake, Cain and Abel, the False Jew and the Messiah of the Revelations‚Äì are not individuals or entities.The narrative shorthand is an Everyman style description of groups, of cultures.The Messiah To Come is a people, a Tribe.They will gladly herald the wrong one, awaiting a King.  Such a simple trick, so it all seems expected, except it brings the dark-mirror version.  A Bloody Messiah behind the curtains.The Revelations, for some, are not a warning, but a victory celebration.The trick is that there‚Äôs no cavalry or Calvary coming.  The Christ followers, and the others of good will, are already here.They are all the force we call the Creator can do.  Escape is the only option until we figure out how to defeat the dread Infection.Well, at least there‚Äôs still a Heaven- that‚Äôs what a living world is for, to form one, just as we bodies create the gods, not they us- but the living world will belong to the seeds of Abraham, the Lucifer, and the mad gods of those like him.It will take another turn of evolution to push it back if we are lost. I despair, yet still hope, glad we are alive now, and still have a chance.

            (Apologies to whatever parable I stole this from‚Ä¶) We are just the servants treating each other poorly and wrecking the home, while the Master is away on a journey. The believers would have you believe that Master will punish wrong-doers and restore order when He returns. The skeptics would say there is no master. The Realist (me) sadly notes that, in either case, the house is a shambles in the meantime.  No problem, grab a bottle from the cellar, light up a Blunt and enjoy üôÅ

        Zman, what you are talking about (other livestreamers) is a persona.  also your voice is probably your best feature (not having seen your face though) and you have said people have recognized you at events based on it.   So IMO that should be the ‚Äúcore‚Äù of whatever persona you come up with.I personally find the South eternally interesting, and more than a little exotic.  Southern Gothic is one of my favorite genres, whether in literature, plays, or movies üôÇ  And I think there are a lot of Americans with that same interest; maybe even in the South itself.So I am thinking you should examine people like Mark Twain, Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, etc.  Not to copy them but to get a sense of why they had such cross-over appeal.  Maybe I am wrong, but to me you seem to have a good understanding of ‚Äúboth ends of the bridge‚Äù regarding the North and South.  I genuinely think you could have the cultural and political influence you are working for, by a more oblique approach.Also, are you going to go wide, or deep?  Maybe both, depending on the topic?  Joe Rogan goes pretty wide, IMO, while someone like Michael Savage, or Alex Jones, goes deep.  So to speak.  What is your ‚Äúthing‚Äù going to be?Do you have a clear sense of what your goal is here?

            Try being that guy that lets his guests talk about interesting things, without the host walking all over the conversation, or turning each conversation into a story about what the host thinks.  Of course, the trick is to get guests with interesting things to talk about, and who know how to tell a good story without going on forever.  Finding a good supply of that kind of guest is the hard part.

        New(ish) to this side of the great divide but have listened to most of your podcasts and I‚Äôm trying to work my way through your blog posts. I‚Äôm grateful for your mature and thoughtful discussions because unfortunately so many on the far right (or whatever) sound seem shrill and insane, even though they may be at least partially right on the issues. Have you written any sort of all-encompassing summation of your worldview? If so I‚Äôd love to read it. (And your book, if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre working on.) Anyway, thank you for your good work. I enjoyed learning a bit about The Z Man.
