        The speed and distance that Kirk and Walsh are covering these days are impressive. What we may be witnessing there is the strength of the survival instinct. They are young enough to see themselves in 40 years time, and it is a very dark place to see themselves inhabiting.Will the survival instinct awaken in enough of us in time? The real issue is if it will awaken in those in power who can harness the energy of the American and Occidental awakening. Otherwise it is energy that just dissipates with no avenue of expression.The LA situation is a very stark and sobering situation. Perhaps the most sobering situation are the photos of the LAPD graduating classes. Total White Erasure.Trump is a materialist. His ’25 election night speech was basically saying that America’s social problems will be solved by prosperity and he would be the one to deliver prosperity.At the same time, there is something inside of him that understands the error of that. We see it in his resolute defiance and fighting spirit as he confronts the LA secession/colonial-revolt. Perhaps it should be talked about as a breakaway colony to get it into the skulls of Boobus Americanus what is happening here.There is ample destruction and crime for the DOJ to bring charges. This is war. They must go after the networks funding and facilitating the riots. They must bring charges against these networks.In the meantime, Musk must see his life. He ran from South Africa. He left the Canadian stepping stone. He ran from California. He lives and operates in Texas which is already fully SouthAmerIndian-ized and not far behind California. He isn’t going to be running to Mars. A small souled, materialist bugman needs to wake up very quickly and wake up a few of his buddies with him. Running to seasteads and running to Mars are just elaborate copes and escape plans for cowards who are afraid of their responsibility.Yarvin was wrong. A CEO is not a monarch. Proof? Monarchs and nobility despised the vulgar simpletons that loved being merchants. Where is the American Alfred and where are his Aldermen? The time is now.

            “Will the survival instinct awaken in enough of us in time?”Again, the Black Pill.  Is it not already too late for the demographic solution to be tried?  This country is destined to be one of minorities fighting for supremacy, or at least a greater part of the spoils of the past generation’s efforts.  That cannot be changed.We see no place on earth countries—where there is a mixture of races/ethnics/cultures in which one is decidedly superior/prosperous to the other—where there is not conflict among them.  Often, violent conflict.  This conflict is only ameliorated through separation.  India after independence is a good example.Is separation what Z-man implicitly talks about today?

                Any future where separation is possible also holds the possibility of deportation.Even now, if we just enforced the damned law, self deportation would be huge.
They will never let us run to our own region of the US.  Ain’t gonna happen.  Deportation would be easier.  Even if they did, the same thing that happens in South Africa would happen there.  They would want outside labor to do certain jobs.  I’ve heard that most of the farm murders were inside jobs committed by employees because the White farmer would never think of hiring White help.

I hear ya, but deportation only addresses part of the problem—the most recent part to boot.  It can’t produce a a White ethnostate.  It never could for at least 150+ years.  The reason, Blacks.
14% of the population and 50-60% of the crime and ensuing social pathologies.  Separation, as remote a proposition as it mays seem, is the only answer.

                        I agree.  That’s why I said we would end up suffering the same problem as South Africa.
Blacks are precisely the reason a White ethno-region is highly unlikely at least in the near term future.  The elites, including White elites worship blacks.
But perfect is the enemy of the good.  Getting rid of millions of foreigners acting as a 5th column/agitators in our country is good.

                            In any war, and this is an existential war, some things are valuable simply because they waste the enemy’s time and resources. We also need to do whatever little things we can to encourage self-deportation. One fairly obvious thing that I haven’t heard about yet is a campaign to get suburban and rural people to boycott any landscaping company that hires illegals. For the sake of simplicity we can just go with the idea that any 4’8″ guy with brown skin is probably an illegal while a 6′ White kid in a ballcap probably isn’t. This also helps start a trend of shaming younger Whites to start doing some of those “jobs Americans won’t do”. We could even find a way to enlist girls in the shaming effort. Imagine that, young White girls actually doing something that helps our people!

                            Some of our own will sabotage the excercisors of said option.The other side has a say how events play out.Not all of them are daft. They can build a nucleus and fight unless we get them early.I don’t want to sit here and do nothing but likewise I don’t want to waste my energy on failure.I was standing in line at the local Walgreens tonight. A black lady had to explain to her two rambuncious sons why they didn’t need to buy sunscreen sitting there in the impulsive purchase bins.Her boys are literate, soft-spoken types. Most of you would like them. I can live with blacks. It’s the jews who want us erased for their sins. They are saboteurs, always. Even Stene Miller, as I suspect we shall see.

                        Yes. Balkanization is inevitable and even happening around the margins now. The Mexican nationalist nature of the unfolding immigration riots in LA foreshadows what is ahead. I increasingly like our odds, which surprises me.

                This is the battle right here. We still have numeric superiority, but it is the closing window of opportunity.A low agency people see events as happening to them and destiny to be fore-ordained.A high agency people see events as unfolding and presenting opportunity to use their force of will to create and control their destiny.The Trump presidency is an opportunity for the latter. He holds the office and the power. His base, we dissidents, have the power to bolster him.Black Pilled: A person who opens their eyes to reality but who lacks agency and thus gives in to despair and capitulates.White Pilled: A person who opens their eyes to reality but who has agency. He identifies and acts to seize the opportunities to direct the best outcomes for himself and those he loves.Right now, aside from you fortress building activities, the system dictates we encourage Trump to solicit our help and to let him know we have his back. It is important to keep the morale high. Remember last summer. Fight! Fight! Fight!

                    Agreed.  There is no saving AINO as a whole; nor would I want to.  It would be lovely to have a regional White nation, but the earth’s self-appointed ‘healers’ (i.e. agitators) would never countenance that.  It’s why Harold Covington envisioned such a nation that would be eternally vigilant by necessity, and constantly under threat by outside agitation.  It would also require civil and manual labor by all citizens, to prevent the hiring of outsiders and alien races and all the evils they entail.  I question whether there remains a sufficient remnant of Whites capable of such resolve.

                        The solution would to make whiteness the new polity’s foundational charter. In other words, if you’re not white then your presence in Whiteland is illegal. We could work out the details of punishments, but they would certainly be severe, and for any whites who abetted the presence of non-whites, it would be terminal.

                        If there aren’t enough Whites who will stay vigilant there’s no point in trying to do anything. The problem is that the current generations of Whites, particularly the older ones, got the idea that civic duty meant voting every so often and keeping the commies at bay. Then there weren’t even commies to keep out. This is related to the idea that everything is, or should be, some kind of transaction. I put in my little bit of token effort and then I just have to abide by whatever happens in “the process” that follows. It’s this attitude that gives us all of our paperwork Americans. Well, they went through The Process so we can’t object to them being here. We’ve got to start seeing The Process as the The Problem when it works against us.

                        The problem is that inevitably you will end up with some Whites who can’t resist either outsourcing or importing labor to reduce labor costs. A successful White nation would indeed have to be a small one, where large scale organizations cannot exist, such that the elite become detached from the people.

            Right on!  I have often conducted informal polls of random people in restaurants with a simple question–which decade, from the ’50s to the ’90s, would you rather live in?  The ’50s wins overwhelmingly for one simple reason…in the ’50s, we had tremendous community with people always willing to help their neighbors, traditional good schools, and the richest man in our suburb lived with the rest of us, with a slightly bigger house…A McDonals owner in our village built a large, garish house in a pricier suburb…but his wife and daughter refused to move into it, and stayed in the old neighborhood with their friends and neighbors….

It was that way in my mid-size CA town also.  But at popular level, that was a masculine and Christian nation.  Most persons belonged to extended families who lived in the same town.
Now, no.  It’s a feminist, secular-atheist, atomized country.

        I don’t know whether this is absolutely correct but let’s hope so! Culture indeed is infinitely more important than wealth. A healthy society neglects neither but at the end of the day, as you point out, realizes culture is the more important of the two.It certainly does seem that libertarianism has imploded. Paul and Massie are both highly intelligent idiots who never let necessity and the public good get in the way of their ideological fanaticism. After years of dazzling the masses with their brilliance to such a degree their blatantly moronic beliefs were ignored, they seemingly collapsed overnight. It appears semi-fellow traveler Musk, because of the lunatic LA riots, is coming around now, something Paul and Massie never will do. Because who are they going to believe, Ayn Rand or their lying eyes? I really think the Floyd riots set the stage for a cultural revival in the United States, and the illegal alien protests are putting the icing on the cake. Yeah, you will pay a nickel more for a head of lettuce but it will be much safer to walk to the grocery store. People are deciding they prefer the safe walk.

        The Cultural Marxists and libertarians are two sides of the same coin. They are both blank slaters who believe that humans are interchangeable lumps of clay that can be molded into whatever shape they want via culture for the Marxist or economic incentives for the libertarians.
Neither believes in racial differences. Even more importantly, neither can conceive of the notion that individuals might feel a bond with their race and work together with their people to protect and promote their race. Both are inhuman.

Each individual calculator doing what is best for himself makes the entire society better off, because that is perfectly rational.Principlen. – A means and/or excuse to never take action or defend the things that are most valuable according to libertarian theory – life, liberty/sovereignty and property.Game Theory– The means to exploit and totally destroy the people foolish enough to see human beings as rational economic calculators.Marxist Dictionary:Humann – A thing that is a victim of external forces. Its envy, avarice and desire to get something for nothing make it a perfect machine to dispossess the current elites and replace them through mobilizing the mass of envy and avarice.Societyn – A complex piece of social fabric and accumulated human genius and capital that is the object of the will to power. To assume control of it and exercise its power it must be subverted and if necessary destroyed.Principlen – A thin veil, a mask of virtue used to trick the masses into exercising their destructive impulses for the cause of good so the new elite can dispossess the old eliteGame Theoryn – A well understood mechanism that shows how easy subversion and destruction of a post-society of economic calculators can be subverted, dispossessed and destroyed.

            I totally agree that most libertarians are blank-slaters; I certainly was in my LP activist days. On the other hand, nothing in Austrian economic theory requires that viewpoint. Rand certainly understood the differences, even if she never explicitly said so. There are no African, Arabic, or Asian surnames among the heroes of Atlas Shrugged. The problem was, as Z correctly states, the libertarian notion that economics is the ONLY thing that matters. What does prosperity matter if we can’t preserve our civilization and heritage for our children and grand-children?

        I’ve learned to be suspicious whenever I hear an economic argument made in favor of anything at all.Nobody ever made an economic argument in favor of chocolate ice cream, puppies or Taylor Swift tickets, which seem to be things people actually want. The only time the economic arguments get trotted out is when somebody is trying to lube up a dildo to shove up our asses.Even the dumbest salesman knows if he wants to make a sale, he has to convince you the product is good for you. When he has to tell you it’s “good for the economy”, he’s acknowledging there’s no way he can convince you it will be good for you, so he’s distracting you with appealing to an abstraction.Beware the economists.

        One thought experiment is if America goes through another Great Depression (2.0? 3?), what effects would that have on the current state of mass legal/illegal immigration? Picture the stark conditions and austerity that would occur and who would still be in the country 5-10 years later. Once the benefits and perks dried up, most would waste no time going back to their home countries. We’d find out rather quickly who is an actual American.

            I’ve had this very discussion with others. The consensus seems to be that it would require economic catastrophe to encourage the invaders to leave on their own volition. The Left wants to milk the Heritage population to prop up their alien clients, but my guess is that would not pan out as planned. The Tech Bros, among others, have belatedly realized they are not immune from the milking machine, either. That explains much of the shift.

                Yes. When people talk about “remigration,” they need to accept it will require force and violence. I don’t know who correctly decided to start with violent felons being the first deported, but the Left and Libertarian Right defending them has helped make the moral case for throwing out more sympathetic economic cases, who are the vast majority.

                    They’d be just as likely to be better organized than Whites (plenty of Latino and Somali and Cambodian gangs here) and they’d come take over the soup kitchens and/or demand protection money.  People are so naive; they’re not all as stupid as joggers and they are already criminally organized nationwide.

                Give the immigrunts their own depression. Raise the tax on remittances to punitive levels. Then they will leave. For the most part there will be no need for drama. If the princess who runs Mexico doesnt like it, tough titties. As for the heritage noble savages within our borders, there are remedies for their presence as well, different but just as effective.

                I concur, but it is a widespread and persistent fantasy, unfortunately.  And one based on a purely materialist view.  Yes, the aliens are here for your stuff, but also your wives and daughters, and the society only Whites seem able to build.  The Han want Whites’ creativity and ideas and (former) stability.  The Koreans here didn’t come fleeing domestic ‘repression,’ they came for MONEY.  And the only reason they were allowed to take to the rooftops in the LA riots was because they were/are/always will be nonwhite.   Any White who had tried to organize an armed defense of property would have been arrested.

                Exactly, living on welfare and food stamps in some shithole neighborhood in CA or even someplace cold and nasty like Boston, is preferable to living in a house made of literal cardboard without indoor plumbing, air conditioning, or anything but rats to eat in Latin America.Now if you’re going to suppose that the economy is so bad that welfare and other gibs have stopped then yes, the incentive to come or to stay is mostly gone. If anything, though, a real hardcore depression would turn a lot of fair-weather libertarians into raving Bolsheviks with the people voting for even larger handouts than before. To really get rid of the wogs without resorting to force, you’ve got to make your countryworsethan theirs and then there’s no point in caring what happens.

            Would they leave? The United States is not going to have an economic depression in a vacuum.  I would assume the impact on Latin America would be stark, especially considering how much of those economies is now dependent on remittances from the U.S.  I think most would attempt to squat where they are even in depressed conditions rather than return to the home country.

            Diversity only works when there’s prosperity. When there’s little prosperity, at best we get Yugoslavia and at the worst we get Rwanda.
I hope that many people are coming to terms with the fact that if our economy is to fail, better to live with fellow ethnics than diversity plus the longhouse.

                “Diversity only works when there’s prosperity.”
I tend to disagree.  It seems so, but that accepts that the gifts of “prosperity” are distributed “equally”.  This is never the case because the people are different and worse, races are inherently different.  One race outpaces the other and more of the resulting “prosperity” falls to such.  Prosperity will for a while mask the animosity and jealousy that arises from the inferior race(s), but sooner or later such comes to the forefront.  The result is conflict.
And here we are today.

            It will only happen if the money is taken away before such a scenario occurs.I think and I fear that the future is an informal but de-facto sorting. Mayorkas and Krugman know this and thus the hurry to flood every nook and cranny of America and England with aliens.The will and agency of the Historic American Nation is going to be tested when it becomes apparent that a clear and hold approach may be necessary to establishing and maintaining outposts of America.One critical piece will not just be the will and physical capability of such redoubts. It will be the ability to purge vice. Cartels and other competitors that cannot prey on vice (drugs, prostitution, low-culture), will not have an interest in such locations. Cultivate virtue as a key part of the clear and hold strategy we will need to enact in the coming decades.

                So I asked the gal in Utah where all the Samoan weed gangs were.(Their missionaries to Hawaii had sparked a huge influx of primo Kona in the 70s.)
She told me they couldn’t make any money in Deseret, so they left.
I guess Mormon kids would rather shag the wife than get high.I also guess because the wife isn’t trained to dump the man and kids for a closetful of shoes.
(p.s.- all that has changed now because the Church got the word, diversity is good. Somehow, good looks really trashy and rude.)

                    The Mormons shat where they eat, and enthusiastically married off their blonde daughters to mestizos and Samoans.  The die is cast for them, just as it is for all other AINO Whites – demographic swamping and mystery meat.

        I’ll defend Rand Paul on one thing, which I don’t want to do, but it’s necessary. He made the point that according to the Trump admin, the border is already closed. This was a point frequently made by Republicans during the “bipartisan bill” debate. The President already has enormous border powers. Mayorkas just chose to fling open the border instead. If anything that stupid bill made the President’s powerweaker, not stronger, which was the point. For heaven’s sake, the Brandon cabal was literally flying people into the USA from foreign countries – a wall isn’t going to stop that.College athletics is already dead, for sure, but I’ll also bring up another sportsball thing – replay. Nowadays people are so focused on “getting the call right” that they institute these boondoggle replay systems that ironically kill the flow of the game and make it unwatchable. I keep yelling into the void that I’d rather live with a few wrong calls than this nonsense, because it misses the point of sportsball.

            The selection of college football by our host as symbolic of decline into decadence and materialism is perfect. Started out a bunch of young college doods roughhousing, as they tended to do, and grew organically.  Roughhousing now is probably illegal for boys.In the Fifties and Sixties, the sport still was largely innocent and guarded its amateur status strictly. Sure, some of the biggest stars got perks from local businessmen and boosters, but it was a far cry from the paid professionalization of college football now extant.If you could find a bookie, mebbe you laid a little bet. Now, America is the bookie and strong men become lost in fantasy football, while the nation burns.America did not lose her innocence. She sold it.

                It’s worse than professional football because these guys are just pay for play mercs. This past offseason, a brownoid who played for the University of Tennessee left because they didn’t want to give him a raise, but another team snatched him immediately. He wasn’t even that good.And yes the gambling thing, isn’t this libertarian ideology run amok? “If people want to bet on sports, who are we to say they shouldn’t?” So now there is a huge rise in gambling debt, broke young men are enriching the Adelsons and Wynns of the world, every commercial break has 5000 ads featuring highly paid celebrities, and the sports channels openly talk about spreads and lines. If you don’t believe in morality and spirit and don’t believe the government has a role in promoting it, this is fine!

Don’t blame the Libertarians.  Blame the local, State, and Federal government who discovered you can legalize evil and make money off of such activity to boot.  Name one of these legalized “evils” that does not take a cut of the proceeds ostensibly through a “sin tax”.

                        I’ll blame the libertarians for giving ideological cover for these evil governments. The most common two arguments I heard when DUDE WEED was being legalized was the libertarian “freedom” argument AND the “we can tax it” argument. The fact that a huge chunk of this tax money gets funneled into programs that are (poorly) designed to mitigate the harms of the stuff being taxed never really gets discussed.

                            I can say that I’ve *never* heard a Libertarian argument for any of these evils and I’ve lived through their creation.  For example, legalized gambling here was sold as “increasing” funds to education and therefore a greater good than that the evil of families becoming poorer due to participating in these type of activities.Of course, even then this argument was shown false by researchers who showed that the legislatures in these new “gambling” States reduced their budget allocations to public education by the amount of new revenue provided by legalized gambling.  It took about 5 years, but after such time there was no difference in the public funds outlays that would have been predicted via trend analysis.In the entire US, there were *no* exception among those States. Improved education was simply a ruse.

                In the Fifties and Sixties, the sport still was largely innocent and guarded its amateur status strictly.Oh you sweet summer child:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCNY_point-shaving_scandalThe CCNY point-shaving scandal of1951was a college basketball point-shaving gambling scandal which revealed widespread bribery and match fixing involving major colleges and universities both in and around New York City, particularly at the Madison Square Garden. While the public scandal officially involved at least seven American colleges and universities (with one university having a player retroactively participating in the event during this time after initially being missed during the original investigation period) the scandal has been most closely associated with the 1949–50 CCNY Beavers, which won both the 1950 NCAA basketball tournament and 1950 National Invitation Tournament and had a number of players implicated in point shaving and match fixing.Also, the entire plot of the Marx Brothers movieHorse Feathers:The film revolves around college football and a game between the fictional Darwin and Huxley Colleges. Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff, the new president of Huxley College, is convinced by his son Frank, a student at the school, to recruit professional football players to help Huxley’s losing football team. Baravelli is an “iceman”, who delivers ice and bootleg liquor from a local speakeasy. Pinky is also an “iceman” and a part-time dogcatcher. Through a series of misunderstandings, Baravelli and Pinky are accidentally recruited to play for Huxley instead of the actual professional players.

                    Sure if you want to cherrypick, there is an element of corruption in almost all organized activities, including your local church. And yes, including football.However, I had a close childhood friend who went on to play at UCLA and then with the Falcons. He played for the LOVE OF THE GAME which you seem assured never existed, and yes, also for the scholarship (he was quite intelligent and graduated in Kinesiology).  This was in the early-Seventies.They got per diem and so forth, but PAYOLA WAS NOT COMMON AT COLLEGES FOR MOST PLAYERS. As I mentioned above, yes the exceptional players always received perks of one kind or another.‘Oh you sweet summer child’I am a winter soldier junior and almost done being that.

It is temporarily closed due to executive action but can easily be reopened via subsequence executive action and the courts. That is the game Rand Paul is playing.

                Point taken – but would any law stop the next Mayorkas from flinging it open again? This is part of the problem with “democratic” governance. Even if the OBBB made all of Mayorkas’ actions explicitly illegal, as we saw with the student loan debt fiasco, they’ll just figure out another way to do it. They know nobody will stop them and unlike Trump, they can shut down Congress-allocated funds and programs without any rapid judicial pushback (because the judiciary mostly agrees with them).

                        It had been “happily” lawless until the police forces became militarized, our governments grew exponentially, and surveillance became omnipresent.
Prior to the 1980s, you could get away with a lot of shit. Even if you did, there was vigilante justice, and the vigilantes could get away with a lot of shit. Nowadays, if an immigrants rapes your daughter, and you kill him, YOU go to jail.

I sure do.  Rand Paul as far as I’ve ever heard from his mouth has never made a Libertarian argument for a balanced budget.  Rather, he pointed out the fact that the purported savings from DOGE has been completely *spent* in this new budget. He has a point.  Trump has a point as well.  Trump thinks he can juice the economy and grow out of the deficit.  Pick your poison.

                For my second Black Pill of the day, I’d remind folk that the open vs closed border issue is perhaps not even half the problem.  These folk become citizens and through “chain migration” will sponsor many more times their numbers as immigrants.

                    I got a good lesson in “chain migration” from a good friend in the State Dept. For example, say you have a family that was allowed to immigrate from Pakistan. In a few years, they are able to get citizenship. Then, they are able to sponsor more family members, even some extended family. In another few years, the cycle repeats. In decade or so (sometimes less), an entire village, because they are all “related”, has immigrated over. This will include all the self-sustaining social structures and values. No assimilation necessary.

            We know that the Brandon admin flew in at least 400,000 illegal aliens, at taxpayer expense, because they admitted that. We can assume the real number is larger. The mind boggles that not a single court case has been brought against them over this, ever, by anyone, even though this was blatantly illegal. When Trump tries to expel one single wog, the court filings are fast and furious, the judges eager to act. You even get a senator going to drink margaritas with him.Among all the regime lawlessness, this one stands out to me the most, yet seems to get the least play. Everybody seems focused on “Epstein.” More salacious I guess. Or is the focus on Epstein perhaps somewhat astroturfed, to distract from the larger, brazen crimes hidden in plain sight like this one. A presidential administration that took it upon itself to not only nullify but contravene all immigration law, to shred the social contract, because you’re racist. That was the justification.More depressing still was that while the Brandon admin was actively replacing us, and using the apparatus of the state to do it (again, 100% illegal), not a single active DHS or ICE agent refused, quit, or even spoke up.

                The fed right is pushing the line that the events in Los Angeles are a “distraction” from “Epstein,” by which they mean Elon’s claim that Trump is a child rapist. (“That’s not what he said!” You’re not smart, nerds.) It’s not working.First, the obvious: Invasion/replacement has been so successful that normal people’s lives are dominated by it. Every “But what about—!” gets interrupted by a Mexican stealing their phone.More importantly—daily black pill—what people want from Epstein™ (the story) isamnesty for our enemies: Our elite are against us because Jews tricked them into raping kids on film and use the threat of revealing that to make ourrightful mastersmistreat us. Not true. Doesn’t even make sense. We know who’s on the “client list” and it’s cost them nothing. But people really want to believe it. It absolves the elite of responsibility for every wrong they’ve done us.People want that more than they want to live.(The idea that cops act against us and their oaths for “muh pension” is the same. They do it because it’s what they want to do. This fact is unacceptable. So, economics.)Putting Trump on “the list” wrecks the story. He doesn’t do us wrong (much). He isn’t on “the list” anyway—he doesn’t show even a normal man’s interest in teenage girls, let alone a compromising criminal lust for them—but that’s irrelevant. Trump-as-Epstein-client is a massive plot hole. People value the storyand their role in ittoo much to allow it. They want Bill Gates to kill them, and they want their last words to be “I understand, it’s not you.”

                Well said.  And no one seems to wonder how many of the womyn and mestizos in the California National Guard and Marines Trump has sent into LA actually sympathize with the insurrectionists.  Trump bit off more than he can chew by going into CA, when he could/should have focused on many other states.  This ends badly, whether he capitulates (which I expect) or not.

        My thoughts on Universal Basic Income. Even if every human in the world had an equal share of income paid them without having to labor, there would still be strife, envy and resentment, because not all groups are equal in their desires. Blacks would use their payments for drugs, guns, fancy cars, clothes, tickets to sports events, and still, no matter how much they were paid, would loot, burn, rape and kill themselves and others, then whine and complain that they were still being oppressed-it’s never enough. Whites would collaborate and use their amassed or donated portions of funds to build a library or a medical clinic or a science lab or a wall. Altruism may be race specific after all?

            “Blacks would use their payments for drugs, guns, fancy cars, clothes, tickets to sports events…”Human nature of course…particular proclivities centered around race.Anyway, I’d say we already *have* UBI. 100 years ago, there was no welfare. Today it is everywhere in many forms. That I maintain *is* UBI. I for example get SSI, and no I get (actuarily) more than I paid in. That’s UBI. I get Medicare—that’s UBI. When I was younger, I went to public school free. That’s UBI.What folks want is more UBI. Money with no strings attached *and* their current welfare bene’s to boot. Precisely the people who deserve it the least and would use it the worse.Until we live in an AI, robot world, money still represents a unit of work that someone, somewhere created through their effort. In this regard Ayn Rand was prescient in her writings.

                    Agreed, but you will never convince Boomers that Social Security and Medicare isn’t “their” money.  It’s all their money, technically, and the feds take it all as a tax – as the Supremes ruled in their ‘wisdom.’  They all get more than they paid in and feel they deserve it because they ‘earned it.’

        History is full of great ironies. It turns out that the terminal point of the Commies’ “long march through the institutions” is where the institutions themselves start collapsing. Consent and Legitimacy are ineffable; once undermined, forces get unleashed that are very hard to control. There’s no New York Stock Exchange symbol for Consent or Legitimacy. They don’t trade every day. But they’re more valuable than Amazon or Exxon. For whatever reason, Libertarians and Leftists don’t understand this.

            Addicts is right. Back in the 80s when very rich MLB and NFL players went on strike seemingly every other year, the media would interview fans who claimed univocally that they would never return to the ball parks and stadiums. Ha ha. Yeah right.

                I cut all emotional ties with my favorite NFL team when I was convinced they threw a game. (I’m still convinced they threw it). It was a clean break, surprising even myself. Never looked back. Never felt anything for them since. I couldn’t have guessed it would be so easy.

                    It is a surprisingly easy for certain folk. I grew up a hardcore Dallas Cowboys fan. My dad used to entertain his buddies by having me recite the Cowboys’ two-deep when I was four years old. But, along about 1995, I got so sick of reading about this Cowboy or that being busted for this felony or that, and owner Jerry Jones excusing them in this way or that, that I told the Cowboys to fuck off and haven’t watched one of their games since. Abandonment of the NFL soon followed. And my Sundays have been much better in consequence.

        Thankfully, I live in a rural part of the US that is still about 80% White. When the Covid lockdowns started people were rushing to the stores to stock up. 2 weeks in you could still get bread and toilet paper, but then waves of vans full of more diverse folk from larger cities (Detroit, Cleveland, some 6-7 hours away) started raiding our Wal-marts and grocery stores. The place was picked bare and would not be restocked for months. That was just 5 years ago, but bears remembering.Last summer I took a business trip with some colleagues to a conference in the Smokey Mountains of TN. Once we arrived, we stopped at a Wal-mart to grab a case of water and some other necessities. We were the only White people there and the only ones speaking English. The place was packed with South Americans toting those shiny new Biden $5k visa cards.  My friends were shocked. I laughed.Rand Paul is playing with fire. Thankfully the tech bros know the score, but they are going to need to find and hire a lot more JD Vance clones if they want to fix this. It’s a ticking timebomb.

        “destruction of college sports where “reform” is about getting the money right”. I had a conversation with the old man this morning about the “threat” from the left to cancel the 2028 LA Olympics because…Trump / Hitler. The conversation was…” who cares, they’re all professional athletes anyway”. He had a coworker that competed in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics (javelin). An engineer during the week and track events on the weekend. Now that is interesting.

            My feelings are while I mightn’t like where college sports (football and basketball) are headed (I agree with others on this thread about the crassness of the gambling ads and paying students), let’s not be naive about why many “student” athletes are in school. They ain’t curing cancer, finding new sub-atomic particles, or becoming a surgeon. They are there to play sports and hopefully get recruited to a professional team. They’re making millions (heck, perhaps even billions) for the Ol’ Alma Mater, why not let them dip their beaks? Admit what you are and let’s get it over with. Give ’em a Professional Athlete Degree and move on.

                You’re making the materialist argument, i.e. that it is filthy lucreuber alles. There was a time when loyalty to coach and teammates, desire for an education, love of school/fans/traditions, etc., and the thirst for winning championships, were legitimate factors among college players. Now it’s strictly sacks of gold straight down the line, and I abominate that mentality.

            Quite an insightful thought from this gentleman.  The Olympics is a farce.  A commercial enterprise funded by the taxpayers for the benefit of a few.  As I read, this “grift” is being recognized and most countries no longer contend to host the Olympics.  So much so, the Olympic committee is running scared.

            I can see a disrupted Olympics as beneficial, actually.
“Who cares?”
The pigs for whom the spectacle is conducted, that’s who. The actual .02 percent, those folks, care a lot. It is more than entertainment for them; they let the rabble watch as a way to flex. Ozymandias in summer-friendly white shorts and shoes lets you look upon his performers, peasants! Interrupting their javelin-throwin’ minstrel show is to be encouraged.

        One of my dissident slogans is “the collapse is the cure.” I say this, not as a fan of doom, but because it’s the only feasible macro-phenomenon that can restart our ancestral immune response to societal disease. Civility is killing us in slow motion because it inhibits the culling that is necessary to rid our DNA of dysfunctional genes. It’s not possible to talk your way to DNA enhancement, and neither debate nor analysis has any influence on natural evolution.The culling is coming whether we like it or not.

            I blame modern healthcare for keeping the worst people alive.
If the healthcare system collapses, a lot of the leeches would just die. The panicked reaction to Covid-19 really demonstrated how many people would not have existed in previous eras.
I hear white men are actively discriminated against in med school applications. Good, let people experience the vibrancy of diversity when it comes to the health. Basically, if you’re healthy, you’ll be fine as you won’t have to go to the hospital. If you’re unhealthy, oh well…

        Marx argued that oppression and inequality were the result of economic relations.It’s actually the means of production (the material implements of our time, our technology) that serve as the base, and social and cultural relations (oppression, inequality) are the superstructure built upon it. Social relations (socialmores, religion, law, sexual attitudes) are the result of the dominant means of production of one’s time, and serve those means.To an extent, he was right. Look at the way that social relations have changed as a result of computers and now smartphones. Sexual relationships among young people revolve around Tinder and online communication, not in the church hall, or union meeting, or marrying the fella next door who works in the coal mines in your Pennsylvania company town in 1889. Families have dissolved, there is little social cohesion among whites, and most live very lonely lives far away from family in order to take some job in Seattle at a financial services firm after a $400K college education.One may contend that Marx had very bad prescriptions for economic systems, but he was an astute sociologist, and noted how the bourgeois social relationships of his time always seemed to meet the needs of the economy, rather than the other way around. In that sense, he shares something in common with paleoconservatives.I would also add that collapsing birth rates — social relations — are the direct result of the economic models of our time, and the values and morals those models impose upon us in our everyday life. We can opt out, of course, but it comes with a very steep price for one’s life. In 1965 the folks on the commanding heights of the economy declared that white Americans with a healthy life, 4-5 children, and a solid religious and moral ethos, were no longer necessary in the post-industrial economy on the horizon. And so those people were destroyed, and hundreds of millions of foreigners brought in to destroy the social relations of 20th-century American to make sandwiches, cut lawns, and build houses made of cardboard for pennies on the dollar.

            I called the sheriff of the next county over and the police in the city (30 miles away) where they’ve scheduled ‘festivities’ for Saturday.  Neither seemed to have a clue nor a care.  Never even seems to have occurred to them that outside ‘agitators’ and demonstrators may be brought in to block roads or wreak mayhem.

                    In all honesty, I don’t think that’s the case where we now live.  I just don’t think local officials have truly come to terms with how many out-of-staters have moved in and supplemented/replaced the locals in that small city, and all the typical leftist habits and beliefs they’ve brought with them.  Yeah, I know plenty from CA/NY/IL may call themselves conservatives, but they are all utter cucks when it comes to race/genetics/culture.  They’re all busy clearing forest to build golf-course communities, bringing in brown people to build their suburban-style mcmansions in the country, and trying to get locals to spend millions on a fancy new high school.

                        The white sorting disrupts the lives of locals to a degree that cannot be overemphasized. They almost always try to elbow their way into local affairs and politics; a popular bumper sticker in the South after the first wave read “I DON’T CARE HOW YOU DID IT UP NORTH.” In their own way, albeit with far less likely violence, the locusts often are just as destructive to the social fabric as the vibrants.

        I’d like to be able to see more people waking up to the reality of the GR as a cause for hope, but instead I see it as evidence that the GR is so far along, basically a fait accompli at this point, that even idiots can no longer deny it. One can cling to the hope for mass deportations, but they needed to begin yesterday. 10 years ago. The demographic future of this land was decided with finality in the 2020 “election.” Which some of us did predict and say so at the time, but somehow it wasn’t a major issue during the “campaign.” If they’d cared at all, you’d think the Trump campaign would have made an ad out of Biden’s “unrelenting stream” video, but crickets. Although this would have had no effect on the people “counting” the “ballots.”Materialism was how they were able to sell the GR to the “conservatives.” Whatever was needed to make line go up was best (although as it turned out, swamping us with wogs does not make line go up). College football fell victim to the same “values.” Whatever produced biggest dollar amounts was obviously the right thing to do. This thinking began permeating the sport about the same time the TV money started rolling in. The financialization of the sport, 1980s-ish, coincides with the financialization of the empire as a whole.

            Trump is deporting fewer people than Biden.
The focus on the closed southern border is interesting when you understand illegals come through airports, via student visas , as tourists etc
Then there’s the legal migrants who are going to be imported at record rates by Trump.

                This is false. The deportation numbers reported under Biden were fake. The same is true under Obama. They included people turned away at the ports of entry for any reason.
The point of public deportations is to encourage self-deportation. The labor numbers tell us that this is exactly what is happening this year. Record numbers of self-deportations.

                    I mean, you might be right about the virtue of government workers now that Trump is president but Trump’s numbers are not close to being good enough to substantively reverse the demographic reality.
If you look at the record of countries who successfully cleared out foreigners it was done through mass deportations and, yes, self-deportations but still a lot of forced deportations.Pakistan’s recent eviction of Afghanistanis is instructive.
I looked for the official stats for self-deportations and Fox News relates DHS numbers of 5,000 a month. Not good enough, not even close.

        An excellent article.Bottom line, living in an overwhelmingly white nabe with no negroes is, for me, worth a 20-percent pay cut. Likewise, there may not be any amount of money that would compel me to live in a Hutu hood for a whole year.At the subsistence level, of course, materialism is prime. But as one ascends beyond subsistence, materialism matters less and culture/demographics/aesthetics matters more. And right now, almost everybody living in the West does so far above the subsistence level. In conjunction with this prosperity is demographic collapse, and that is why so many white people are becoming so angry.

            “…20-percent pay cut…”
Most likely a one sided monetary equation. One has to consider/compute the reduced costs for living away from the “ferals”. Lower insurance, lower taxes, better government, better schools, etc. Your 20% will quickly disappear in real terms.

                Yes. And while the lower insurance premiums and taxes would be welcome, it is the less quantifiable benefits–better schools, government, etc.–that are the key.  Human existence has needs be evaluated holistically. The materialistic approach is astigmatic.

            Dismantle the healthcare system.
The violence of the ferals becomes a smaller issue if they simply die from self-inflicted violence instead of being kept alive by the healthcare system.
I once saw an ER physican from South Chicago talk about how ennervated he was that most of his patients were young black men with gunshot wounds. Dude had zero self-awareness in regards to realizing he was keeping them alive, so they could go and cause more problems.

        That is a fine essay.Understand exactly where you are.  Where you were set down in the universe, and why.  Our American disease of covetousness is not called ‘paterialism’ and there is a reason for that.The male is the spiritual pole; the female is the material pole.  We are spiritual beings wearing material bodies.  If you are male, you are immersed — par-boiled, as it were — in a MAterial world which, if you truly are a son of Father, you will find hostile, alien, false, and thoroughly feminine.It ain’t just Michael who’s a stranger in a strange land.  He’s just the strangest amongst you, because the most alienated by America and its anti-God, anti-masculine ways.‘In the 19th century, the line turns up a lot and was used to mean that people often stand by and do nothing when terrible things are happening because they fail to appreciate the great struggle with evil that must define life when one acknowledges the existence of it’Bingo.  If you are of God, then this world is just a warzone.  A warzone that sometimes has beautiful backdrops, a la the Sierras or Rockies.  But a warzone nevertheless.  Your soul is what’s on the menu, and what’s at stake.We are in the middle of the greatest war ever waged, on a planet teeming with evil and with enemies, yet I see good men everywhere soft, comfortable, and torpid in MAterialism’s bosom.  When He asks you what you did in the War — and He will — you better have an answer.  ‘I didn’t know one was going on’ is not recommended.

                Why not, joking aside?  Why should the testimony here carry any less weight in heaven than that of a monk in his cave, or a pastor in his church?We are instructed Biblically to fight spiritual war with ‘our testimony’, along with the Blood of Christ and our fearlessness.‘And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death’  (Revelation 12:11)Now that, Donald, is REAL winning.You fight a spiritual war with spiritual tools. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. No sense changing a winning strategy.

        Materialism, yes, but also idealism. Insanity is just as much a problem as slobbery. We need the will. Balance things out. Cosmic RPS, not lurching back and forth.
There’s no argument for things like tradition without acknowledging that they represent some fundamental principle. Otherwise they’re superstition or backwards. That’s where the work needs to be imo.

        Marx, Lenin et al were not entirely wrong. Severian who post(ed) here is an historian. By his account (I hope I am not misquoting him), Marxism is substantially correct about theproblemsbut horribly wrong in proposedsolutions.An example I would assume would be something like:  certainly in the 19th century the robber baron industrialist that owned the widget factory paid his laborers the least he could get away with, probably barely enough to keep them alive.Come the revolution, the Evil Capitalist certainly lost all his property and very likely his freedom and his life. The former widget factory was turned into the Peoples Widget Factory Number 27. Likely, everybody was worse off.

            Evil greedy capitalists and totalitarian dictators aside for the moment, the fundamental problem with Marxism as adopted by the Soviets was “equalitarianism” with a slight variation from today’s “equitists” (is that a word?).The Soviet’s praised/rewarded the worker/laborer above all others in their society.  This created all sorts of absurd renumeration structures—such as a bulldozer operator receiving the same wages as a neurosurgeon.  No modern society can thrive without acknowledging that some in the labor force are more important than others.  Such put a drag or cap on Soviet technological progress and produced a society always playing catch up with the West.  It finally bankrupted them after the Reagan years.

                For all of communism’s allegedly “scientific” approach to economics, its command economies were fundamentally irrational–based upon emotion and sentiment rather than fact and empiricism–and that’s why they were unable to compete with the capitalist models.

            The problem dealing with the inequality between the capitalist and the laborer is that there have often been too many people in the labor class. It is why Elon Musk is freaking out about fertility rates right now. Fewer people everywhere means fewer people in the labor force, which means wages have to go up.
The Plague in Europe demonstrated this. As long as labor keeps overproducing its own supply, capital will keep being able to pay a pittance to labor. Unions mimick the right solution (limitation of supply of labor) artificially.

        “Both assume that once the economics are right, paradise must naturally follow.” Sorry but that is pretty much completely wrong and, as a main strut of your central premise, your argument fails. No libertarian I ever knew expects paradise on earth. We rightly and happily will settle for simply a cessation of the constant trampling on our natural rights. That’s enough to expect from those around us, I need no paradise.

            I think that expecting such a thing counts as fantastical, paradisaical thinking. You can’t “settle” for a cessation of other people trampling on your rights unless you are prepared to fight for them, not argue at Libertarian conventions about them. It’s not a college classroom out there. Life is war, not a textbook where you point out to the barbarian, “hey, look at what Rothbard wrote here, doesn’t it make sense to you?”

You pussies won’t do a damn thing.  You will continue to be trampled and deservedly so.  What’s a natural right? Do you think those rights exist outside of White Civilization?  Maybe if you complain more you’ll get your rights back. At first I didn’t understand Z Man’s intense loathing of libertarians…now I’m right there with him.  You’re nothing but a bunch of nebbish dolts, completely brainwashed and useless.  The NAP is revoked now, what are you cowards going to hide behind instead?

            There are no such things as natural rights.
You got human rights, which are a social construct.You got societal responsibilities, which are a social construct.You got natural rewards, which in your case is most likely dying from weakness.

        I looked up both guys referenced in here. Charly Kirk is good. Charly Kirk is essentially libertarian in my book. The only policy differences is immigration and abortion. I agree with him on the immigration issue but disagree with him on abortion (I’m pro-choice).Matt Walsh is very good at taking on the woke madness. I’ve come to appreciate him on this. But he seems to have this obsession with the notion that everyone should get married and have kids. This is a non-sense. Plenty of people choose not to have kids and live perfectly fulfilling lives. It should be easier for the people who do want to have kids to have them. Getting in a stable marriage should be a prerequisite to having kids. This makes sense. But trying to pressure people into having kids who don’t want them is silly.The abortion issue is a thorn in everyone’s side. Some, mostly republicans, have tried to come up with positive-sum solutions to depoliticize the issue like making the Plan B’s and whatever else available OTC. I thought Dobbs was going to depoliticize the issue by throwing it back on the states and thus removing it as a national-level political issue. Unfortunately, it has not. The reality is people like to get laid and don’t want to have kids. Yet at the same time, we want to protect the kids that get formed along the way. I honestly believe the only way the abortion issue is ever going to be resolved (e.g. depoliticized) is when the bio-engineering revolution completes the separation of sex from reproduction. It simply will not get resolved any other way.

Yes, accept the tenets of sexual liberation and anti-natalism, bestowed on us by our greatest enemy who wants us wiped off the planet.  Just accept all the culture destroying rot of the last century.  There’s nothing we can do, it’s just reality now!  Libertarians will be first against the wall.

                To be honest, other than immigration, I’m not sure you guys have that much to worry about.  As i said before, enforcement of 8 USC 1324 (if Trump had the balls to do it) would resolve the illegal immigration issue in a matter of MONTHS.This article ought to make your day. I certainly found it reassuring:https://barsoom.substack.com/p/the-class-of-2026It suggests that technology and free markets (that pesky thing you don’t like) ought to end a lot of the destructive institutions in our society through natural attrition. Then you guys can create your own institutions and we can create ours to replace them. Call it win-win.

        Rand Paul is right about the bill. The national debt is the biggest problem we face, plain and simple. The demographic issue is nothing more than effective enforcement of immigration law: 8 USC 1324. The reason why we have declining health even though we have material prosperity is due to the medical holocaust. RFK Jr. is tackling this one. Enforcement of 15 USC Chapter 1 would drop medical costs 80% within a matter of months. It would also help end the medical holocaust because it would put an end to a lot of the bogus treatments that do not work.The Z Man has a lot of good things to say. But I think he is blowing the material thing way out of proportion. I have learned over my life that I need three and only three things in order to create the life I want. This first is health and vitality. In short term this means working out and eating healthy. Longer term this involves various DIY life extension protocols that can get me to the time we make LEV. Once we have LEV, all the doors to the permanent summer are open. The second is access to tools (in the Stuart Brand context). This means not only material prosperity and the economic opportunities to generate it, but also access to the DIY life extension stuff (see above). The third, of course, is liberty, the freedom to pursue whatever you choose to pursue. I still maintain that libertarianism is the most appropriate system for delivering these things, and it is these things that allow people to improve their lives.Lee Kwan Yue once said the only obligation society has to the individual is to create opportunity for individuals to succeed and create their own lives and nothing more. I agree with this 100%.Of course money is not everything, college sports being one example. Immigration is another. Most libertarians are open-borders. I am not. I believe a functional society requires a functional people, with “Heinleinian” people being the definition of functionality. I have lived extensively in places like Japan and Malaysia as well as traveled extensively to many other countries. I am well-aware of the realities of human biodiversity, realities that must form the basis of a rational immigration policy.I believe we can protect culture without having to give up personal or economic liberty as well as access to tools.As side note: you will notice that the open borders people never bring up the issue of infrastructure. In order to have a bigger population, you need more infrastructure. But government regulation starting around 1970 has made it impossible to cost-effectively build infrastructure like we did in the 1960’s. Yet we want to pack the country with more people. This does not make sense at all. The open-borders people, whether they be left or right, need to be called out on this.

            The debt is a trivial concern compared to the demographic disaster, the horror of which is approaching Lovecraftian levels.  Once the genetic stock is destroyed it can’t recover for thousands, perhaps 10s of thousands, of years.  Life extension won’t look so great when you’ll be spending the next 500 years cheek-by-jowel with Somalis and Hatians and sundry other… people.Everyone worries about a replay of the Weimar hyperinflation, but that event in no way resembles our current situation here.  But for sake of argument let’s say it would be the same.  So what?  The disaster cleared the way to destroy the weimar regime, which it fully deserved. A handful of years later, wise policy had led to recovery and a prosperity that would have continued to amaze the world had that country not been attacked by the three biggest powers on Earth.  Economic issues can be resolved in years – decades at worst.  Racial death may as well be forever.

                I just said that I am not open-borders. I also said the most effective way to end the migration problem is enforcement of 8 USC 1324, and it can be done administratively. No act of congress needed.

What part of what I said before do you not get?

                    I don’t think I accused you of being for open-borders.  Your comment said the budget problem is indisputably the biggest issue.  I disagree.  I think it is less serious than the immivasion.  I think the right has been both exaggerating the severity of the debt problem and misunderstanding its systemic causes.  MMT is abused to justify a lot of bad behavior, but the mechanics of money’s creation, destruction, and use are reasonably described by that school of thought.  The curse of ‘reserve currency’status compounds the complexity of the problem.You may be quite right about “enforcement of 8 USC 1324″ – but, if its that easy, why isn’t the new administration taking advantage of that?  Perhaps it may be that there are vulnerabilities to that approach that will result in prog judges meddling yet again.  I don’t know the answer, but for some reason its not happening.  I have to conclude that the solution is not so trivially easy.
