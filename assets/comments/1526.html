        Hubbard – Reminds me of an ad I heard on the radio some time back. “Are your employees broken down by senority?” “Yes, mostly the older ones.” Something like that.Point of the comparison toThe Carpetbaggers, a winning prescription for business takeovers has always been to jettison older, more expensive workers and to renegotiate vendor contracts. That may have trained “millennials” to be as they often are, or it may be a growing phenomenon due to soccer and tee ball, where all get trophies and there are no losers.Who knows. In ten years, you guys can argue about it. I probably won’t be around to join in.

        Sports teamsoughtto work like that.  A 22 year old quarterback has many more potentially good seasons than 32 year old.
But a corporation usually doesn’t physically beat up its employees the way a sports team does.  Older employees have skills and institutional knowledge.  The millennial generation, like those of us in Gen X, has seen that loyalty to a company gets you nothing, so they move on before the company moves them out.

        I’m from Gen X, and the millennials grate on me, too.  Too many selfies and too much self-esteem.  In this, you can tell they were raised by the baby boomers, who also have an uncanny ability to focus on themselves.  But God help me, the millennial lack of loyalty to work is rational.
There’s zero loyalty in corporate America.  Twice now, I’ve been hired just before they axed most of the senior employees to save money.  If millennials have no loyalty, then it’s because that’s how we’ve trained them.  We are doomed to live in interesting times.

            I knew I was going to live a different life than most expected when I looked around my first job and saw very few people over 50. I was juts a kid, but it seemed obvious that corporations tend to work like sports teams. They will prefer young and cheap, even with a loss of quality, over old and expensive. Small and mid-sized business is not like that, which is why our rulers are working to crush them.

        Ah, I dunno, Z. Check out Harold Robbins’The Carpetbaggers. The inheritor of Cord’s empire acted as you describe, and that was set in the fifties.
I turned from the workaholic I was into a guy that determined “Millennial employees are unconvinced that excessive work demands are worth the sacrifices to their personal life.” when a close friend died suddenly. I damn sure ain’t no “millennial.”
I think these types are and have always been dispersed among the population.

            It could be. Frankly, I don’t think it is a clean break. The Millennial outlook is not entirely alien to previous generations. It is more of a full flowering of trends started with the Industrial Age. That said, there’s a difference between blowing off work for leisure time and blowing off work because you don’t think you are getting enough pats on the head.My sense is a lot of these young people are so conditioned to get positive feedback for even mundane actions that the real world is like a bucket of cold water on their heads. They respond with a callous indifference to anyone and everything. Maybe that will mature into a tough minded conservatism a decade from now. Life tends to beat the stupid out of everyone. Or, maybe Huxley was right again and we’re headed for a purely transactional society.

        […] it got me thinking about millennials a bit this week. Last summer I did a post on millennials, but it is not a subject I write about very much, beyond the wise crack here or there. What sprung […]

            Some of the oldest known graffiti is from old Egyptians complaining about the youth of Egypt. They found this stuff in the workers quarters around the Valley of the Kings. The fact that those old Egyptians were right is often overlooked. Ditto the old Romans around August of 410 AD.

        The military was making the exact same complaint about my generation of officers, twenty-some years ago, strangely enough also at the beginning of an enormous RIF.  Translated from Newspeak into Oldspeak: “We’re in the process of firing 20% of you in a drawn-out, stressful, unpredictable process and you disloyal punks would rather find a job and quit now than wait for your RIF notice?”

            There’s certainly some truth to that. Back before chasing Akmed was all the rage, I used to train with some reservists. At the time, the military was looking for any reason they could find to wash out middle-aged guys. PFT was the easy one. Reservists were easy prey to this because they were mostly middle-class suburban guys anyway.
Still, private industry is experiencing the same problem and they have no reason to dump on the young and cheap.

        Then again, there are legal/financial firms out there that specialize in dissolving “inherited” companies, amongst squabbling and incompetent heirs, only to see the resulting cash buy oodles of ongoing liabilities, (maintenance/servant’s taxes/exotic auto reg., ins., tires,fuel/taxes/parties/clubbing/first class leisure travel/etc. and the principal be gone in five years.And suddenly, “snowflake” is involved in serial marriage/divorce, and sketchy legal liability claims.

        If millenials are overall 10% less loyal than preceding generations, that adds up to a big change. The fact that some millenials is irrelevant. If you’re eating 10% fewer calories month in and month out, the occasional big meal is irrelevant.People, even reasonably intelligent people, are just too stupid to grasp that fact. There’s something missing in the average human brain. I once told my girlfriend that women tend on average to be more likely than men to take all general remarks personally. She had a meltdown. “How can you say I do that!”Lol. That’s a true story.If a trait was present but rare in 1950, that’s not EXACTLY the same as the trait being common today. If somebody say they can’t see that, don’t waste time trying to communicate.

        People should always find the best deal for themselves. Doesn’t matter what stage of life they are in, or what generation they are from.
