        The problem is the truth is too awful to bear for almost everyone, including people who are sure they are worldly and wise. The truth is Fred Phelps was right. A nation that not only tolerates but celebrates sodomy is evil and condemned by God.

        The libertarians got the internet all wrong, too. They thought it was going to bring the libertarian millennium. Instead it just makes it easier for the nosey to spy on you, the scolds to scold you, and the douchebags to heap calumny on you. The Internet sees your privacy as damage to be routed around. LOL, as the kids these days say.

        It’s no internet rumor, the propaganda has worked. Millennials do in fact believe that twenty percent or more of the population is queer. I’ve asked the ones that I know well, and half of them thought so. They were quite amenable to listening to hard facts to the contrary. I didn’t need to contradict their personal experience, only the years of tv , movie, and academia bs. No doubt there would be social exclusion were they to step out of the darkness.Now I finally understand that the people running those carnivals see themselves as being more than executives or artists or professors, they see themselves first as revolutionaries. It is a secret society far more effective than Illuminati or Masons or the Skull and Bones of our imagination, and they justifiably take great pride in it. It would be as if Jesus returned and converted the entire society into Christians without them even being aware of it.But if the Donald has, accidentally or not, taught us anything, it is that resistance is not futile; but go for broke and not in increments.

        Pssst….. “America’s newspaper of record” is not the New York Post although perhaps it should be.
