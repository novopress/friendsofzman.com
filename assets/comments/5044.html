        Ward, aren’t you being a bit hard on the Beaver?
I think the piece is a pretty accurate description of how things are. Yes, like most of these prices there is always a trace of Gorillas in The Mist anthropology. I don’t get offended by that anymore. Life’s too short.

        …Good Morning Z,I’m with Dr Mabuse on this.I’ve re-read that excerpt several times and I don’t feel condescended to.I think it’s an accurate analysis of the RINO Republican establishment.They’re all in focus groups this weekend, trying to figure out what to doand say to counter Trump.Of course they can’t counter Trump because Trump is willing toprovoke and alienate his enemies:Trump v Telemundo enjoy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c7D77JtuhE&amp;feature=youtu.beThe RINOs want to kiss Telemundo &amp; Univision on all four cheeks.The RINOs co-opted the Tea Party last time, now The Donald is their next problem.Keeping their comfortable berths, or getting an upgrade, is the only problemmost Republicans want to solve.Empty suits looking for a job, or a promotion.Speaking of everything being ” a long time ago”:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EfXxGQNE7Q…

            No. The cloud people see themselves as lions and the rest as sheep; actually they’re more like liver flukes infesting the flock. Trump is a virus that infects liver flukes.

        I don’t see that paragraph as condescending on the part of the writer.  I think he’s accurately describing the attitude of Republican grandees, which indeed IS condescending.  But it’s not caused by the Trump surge, it’s always there.  This “How do you solve a problem like conservatism?” comes up every time the base gets enthusiastic about something, and the only response that is off the table is “Give them what they want.”

        Mathew Continetti would have more success as a tribune of the people, educating the hoi polloi and speaking truth to power if, along with learning some history, he understood the proper use of the semicolon.
