        Gotta disagree, particularly regarding Germany: the AfD (Alternative für Deutschland) chiming in at 7% – during a low-turnout election, and for an otherwise stick-with-the-usual kind of orderly folk – is a remarkable watershed.Yes, remarkable. Yes, watershed.You’re correct as far as the loser Greeks go: they might as well be crying, “gimme mah EBT cards, you raaaacist!”, so one can reasonably discount their results.Don’t know about the Netherlands…I’ve heard conflicting results as to *why* Wilders’ Party didn’t do well; some chalk it up to his remarks about Madame LePen in France, even though she’s long and repeatedly renounced the bigotry of her dad.IN ANY CASE…NO WAY that this is just a ho-hum, nothing-to-see-here kind of election.The key will of course be the national elections, to see where e.g. UKIP stands in the Parliament or the AfD in the Bundestag.POPCORN!

        You are correct that the emergence of an anti-immigration vote in Europe is small beer in many ways, but it is a start. Low turn out maybe (in the UK the Euro elections never draw many people out on what turned out to be a wet night: traditionally Thursday wet evenings depress voting a lot in the British Isles), but it is a start nonetheless. With luck, the vote for UKIP had demonstrated to the ruling elite in Westminster that the people really don’t go along with the elite’s ‘do as we say not as we do’ policies as much as they thought.I have no idea, despite having voted UKIP, what they stand for in the long term but the evidence is they stand right now for more of what I think is best for the nation; as the the three ‘main’ parties in the UK are in lockstep over pro-Europe then it is valuable to remind them that not everyone loves Brussels as much as they do.Quite whether this develops into swing against European rule is another matter but we shall see. I am fond of saying that this country didn’t turn out the way my father and my grandfathers expected. They were prepared to die for Britain in WWII and I am sure had they and their fellows known how power would be eventually handed over without any consultation they may well have lain down their arms, but now it falls to those who remember to try to do what we can in any way we might. UKIP is one way.
