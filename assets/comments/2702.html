        Arguments have been made that if all of us were fully truthful with ourselves about our meaningless little lives, we would all just commit suicide right then and there.
I would counter with “never underestimate a person’s capacity to lie, steal or kill in order to put a roof over his head, money in his pocket, food on the table, and an attractive mate in the bedroom”.
I believe you were sidling up to each of these pronouncements in your essay, but chose to step back at the threshold.
