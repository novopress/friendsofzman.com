        Yep. Almost anyone claiming heath benefits of a gluten-free diet, or claiming that they are gluten-intolerant, is an idiot. Just another food fad of the rich and stupid.

        To some degree..maybe. Sadly and factly, gluten accompanies foods that jack your blood sugar into orbit. Bread, and pasta. Increased blood sugar cause inflammation, which is where the problems begin. Read ‘Grain Brain’. And peanut allergies? NEVER-EVER heard of it until last 10 years. Most kids like me would have starved without PB&amp;J sammiches!
