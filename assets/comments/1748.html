        The Left is infinitely creative (i.e., diabolical) so let’s not dance in the street yet.
Wade himself, and Charles Murray, too, suggest a deafening silence will quite likely be the Establishment’s response.
Still, you’re right that this should be the crack that brings the whole dike down.

        Can’t see pre-crime working. Laws change – slavery went from legal to illegal – same is true for insider trading. There is also a difference between lowlife rapists and killers vs. plain old thieves and confidence men. The most dangerous criminals – white collar criminals – are very dissimilar to blue collar thugs.
