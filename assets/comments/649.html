        Geography? Jews live in cities – cities tend to be liberal.

            The urbanization of Jews started 2,000 years ago. While it is true that urban populations prefer strong central authorities, they don’t have to be overtly socialist. America had large urban areas well before Marx came along. At the same time, Catholics flooded into American cities in the 19th and 20th century, only to become less socialist over time.My sense is natural selection plays a big role here. The literacy requirements of Judaism seem trivial now, but 2,000 years ago they were enormously expensive. This would drive off those Jews unwilling to make what seemed like a pointless investment. The stock of Jews would become much more faithful as only the fanatics would stick with it. Human populations swelled from the early Middle Ages through the Enlightenment, but the Jewish population remained static.
