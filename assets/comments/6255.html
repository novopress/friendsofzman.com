        Whatever Progressivism claims to be or may have been, today it is just a defense of the status quo posing as an avant-garde critique.Which is why I keep saying that today’s blue-haired bicurious vegan slam poet is tomorrow’s obergruppenfuhrer.  Their whole shtick is being on the “radical” edge of the zeitgeist; their “transgressive” opinions are actually shared by literally every single other person they know.  Right now the zeitgeist is “social justice,” so they’re out there banging the drum for polygamy and whatnot… but after a few more grope-a-thons and workplace shootups from the Religion of Peace, the zeitgeist is gonna change very far, very fast.  They’ll wear their Confederate flag and Nordic rune tattoos “ironically,” of course…. at least at first…. but they’ll get them all the same…. and you know what happens next.

                As a whole bunch of bad shit is now inevitable, let’s roll with it – when the zeitgeist flips, let’s convene a Vichy-style Committee of Truth and Reconciliation.  Don’t let the SJWs off the hook.  “Yes, Moonbeam, you’re all for a border wallnow…. but in 2015 you called such proposals ‘the worst kind of racism.’  And it is a fact that you hold a BA in Wymyn’s Studies, and I have here in my hand a list of tweets where you used the word ‘intersectionality’ seriously…..”Badthink is badthink, and the internet is forever.  Just because you slapped a Confederate Flag sticker over the Coexist one on your Prius bumper doesn’t mean you get a pass.  Time for your reform through labor.

        I’ll be exercising my white privilege in Baltimore this weekend at the National Lacrosse coaches convention. I will definitely have to get a picture of the Freddy Gray mural. Hopefully I’ll live to tell the tale!

        Hell, Bidgood could access Google Earth and use Street View of the Freddie Gray riot area from her favorite upscale coffee shop. What she would see would stir her empath sensibilities and provide a wealth of possible Pulitzer writing material. Isn’t technology great?

        I laughed at your “voxsplaining each bullet point”  Ball-mer has way too many bullet points and that’s the problem.  I lived there many years ago; much saddened to what happened to what once was a good town.

        These Fabian’s are still doing nothing really but waging their war of northern aggression. They never stopped after 1862.They are grooming the next generation of the human extinction movement, passing the torch.A plague of locusts on the Christian west.The best thing for a plague is total extinction.

        I grew up in the Boston area before the Red Line was extended to Davis Square, which is when gentrification in Somerville started. We called it Slumerville, Scummerville, and Bummerville.

        Signaling (and grooming?)“There’s nothing more to it than letting one another know they are on the same team.”Yes, but….who’s a pitcher, who’s a catcher, who’s the  hitter surrogate,  and who’s just out in left field?It’s so….complicated!!!! .

        I lived in Somerville back when it was a dump.  Or, as we called it, Slumersville.

        “Figure out how to drive up housing costs so the poor flee to somewhere else. Then bring in a bunch of hipsters to spruce up the place and before long you have a city with low crime and a thriving social life.”
This is what they are doing in south central los angeles, and all the dimwits are being moved to small town white america and making it the new south central with shootings, drugs, prostitution, etc. etc.Let the fuckers stay where they are.Let the hipsters live with this filth.Leave me alone.

            The problem with “leave me alone” is next comes “get off my lawn” followed by “911…there’s been a shooting right ouside my house” and then “911…I need an ambulance! I’ve been knifed by an intruder in my home!”
Don’t know the answer except to flee while you can to a rural area, preferably in a Red state.
