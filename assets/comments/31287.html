        While my betters were out and about engaging in healthy and productive activities, I was on my knees cleaning baseboards and  listening to what sounds like the final implosion of TRS/NJP.
There’s a lesson or ten here, I’m just not sure what it is at the moment beyond Fool Me Once and In Vino Veritas…

            this really hurts. I’ve been listening to these guys since summer 2015. This song really reminds me of the time I’ve spent listening to these guys:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmrkY-EZy74

        Off topic:  In this video, Jared tries to reason with the chosen.  He implores them that their cause should be our cause because most non-whites see them as white.When they remain unpersuaded, and instead try to enact special protections solely for their group, I wonder if he will begin to suspect that hatred of traditional whites, or at least an irreconcilable distrust, is foundational to that group that “looks white to me,” and is unlikely to change.https://www.amren.com/videos/2023/12/its-not-antisemitism-its-white-hating/Also, the Derb and Fred Reed make an appearance in a Counter Currents discussion, which is something that I never expected to happen, especially Derb.  It’s like the high school chess club kids sat at the same lunch table as the goth kids.  It sounds like Jim Goad was the intermediary.  Fascinating thinkers.https://counter-currents.com/2023/12/counter-currents-radio-podcast-no-562-advice-for-aspiring-writers/

            It’s so frustrating, he gets so close to figuring it out then retreats back to his fixation on blacks as the entire problem.
These ethnic billionaires vigorously supported all the anti-White crap at universities and are only shitting their pants in rage now that it’s their co-ethnics being made mildly uncomfortable by protests.  Jared points this out directly and then makes it out like it was some sort of mistake instead of being driven by the bagels’ unquenchable hatred of Whites.

                “In a move that has raised eyebrows and stirred controversy, Fairfax County School Board member (((Karl Frisch))) was recently sworn into his second term on a stack of homosexual-themed books, a deliberate choice that diverges from the traditional practice of taking an oath on a religious text. Among these books, one notably included graphic content featuring children.”https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4203933/posts

                    Bourbon:  But but but . . . you will make a difference voting locally!  Vote for your schoolboard and city council!  (((Frisch))) won with 67% of the votes.  And none of those parents who protested in the past will actually pull their children from the government schools and homeschool them.

                        Homeschooling is hard, and besides, what would that do to their little darlings’ chances to get into the right college? So, yeah, a lot of performative posturing was done, ’cause reasons.

        Good podcast – enjoyed listening.Regarding “western” movies … favorite character – Everett Hitch in Appaloosa – played by Viggo Mortensen.Of course Clint Eastwood is in a category all by himself … John Wayne became a product of postwar America.Regarding “art” in vehicles (or lack thereof) … the DMC-12 (an unknown name) produced by DeLorean Motor CompanyWhich became somewhat famous in a movie. I recall seeing them running around in the early 80s – in fact, a guy I worked with owned one which I was, unfortunately, never invited to ride in.I owned three pickups over the years and enjoyed every minute behind the wheel of each of them.

        One thing that I find odd about the whole DeSantis shoes thing is that the guy played college baseball at Yale. And before you say it, Yale is division I. He was a third baseman and pitcher, too pressure jobs.Basically, he should be the tough guy, not the Jeb Bush of this batch of candidates. He certainly shouldn’t be trying to look taller.It’s a shame. The guy had a lot of potential, but he just couldn’t say to no to neocon money.On the positive side, it’s very clear that a huge chunk of the GOP base is way past falling for the establishment puppets. Cobra’s popularity is a sign of that. The first step to this side of the great divide is losing faith in the system, and millions of Republican voters are in that process. I can only pray that the GOP stops Trump from being on the ballot. That would really push things forward.

        &gt; The carny was unaware of the mountain of stories about the FBI role in the eventFrom everything that I’ve read over the years, the FBI had plenty of informants and agents in the crowd, but was generally surprised by January 6th.  The Feds who actually created the January 6th breach – Epps, Scaffold Commander, the fence removers, the pipe bomber(s), the people who made the secret calls to ensure that there was no National Guard or extra capitol police on duty, the guys arrested on Jan 5th in from of the DoJ with a van full of explosives and firearms and then quickly let go – were from a different Federal agency, probably foreign-facing and color-revolution experienced – a CIA or military intelligence unit.

            My second favorite confused-about-January-6th “take” is when Trump supporters complain that his requests for police and troops were denied.
They’d have slaughtered the crowd.
The sublimely idiotic take is that Trump failed to “cross the Rubicon” that day. He wasn’t in command of any faction of the military for a single moment of his presidency.

                NG and more cops would have been  a show of force that would have stopped the uprising before it began.  That would have meant no j6 propaganda campaign .   Having the skeleton crew assured the capitol breach would happen.  Worked well for them.

            Also – I imagine that many or most readers here may know this already, but just to write it out – the reasons why Dem-aligned professional Federal soft coup instigators created Jan 6th:* They pulled out stops and shredded any laws and norms they could to ensure they stopped Trump in the 2020 election.  But the  mountain of fraud and irregularities that the nation was left with was glaring and actionable.  Even some relatively risk-adverse Republicans were talking about refusing to certify, or at least investigating.  So, the riot served to try to delegitimize opposition to, or even questioning of, the fraudulent election.* Much of the American public was pissed over the seditious, insurrectionary war that Democrat paramilitaries has waged against them during much of 2020.  The agents wanted to turn that energy against the Right instead.* Republican legislators were becoming radicalized over repeated physical terrorist attacks against them: the Scalizie mass shooting in 2017, the repeated mob attacks outside the 2020 Repub convention, the possibly intentional Feb 2017 parking of a garbage truck on the tracks in front of a speeding train full of GoP lawmakers.  The Fed agents saw how that worked, and wanted to both bring those Republicans back into the uniparty Imperial fold, and to use that tool of “making it personal” to radicalize, enrage, and motivate Democrat legislators.

            The Feds also created the pipe bomb hoax at the DNC that night, which was somehow (ahem) “never solved,” despite having the (ahem) “suspect” on video tape.
Considering how they hunted down every Boomer MAGA housewife who took a selfie of herself in the Capitol lobby and swatted her with a tactical team at 5 a.m. …ya gotta figure they weren’t really trying to solve the fake “bomb” thing.

        Like the Zman, I have taken to watching old movies that I missed the first time around. I choose from the lists of awards nominees, which could be a mistake. Here are a few I have watched recently. Sorry if any inadvertent spoilers.Children of Men: Very entertaining, very pozzedTender Mercies: This one was very “real,” felt like real life rather than a movie. Reminded me of Sling Blade in that respect.Kiss of the Spider Woman: Boring. The main character being a homo explains why it was nominated for so many awards (1985). Hollywood’s big pro homo crusade had not yet begun in earnest, and I would say this one desensitized more than promoted.Atlantic City: Waste of time. Completely beyond me why it was nominated for so many awards.Shadowlands: Could be worth a second watch. Since I’m still thinking about it, in a still waters run deep kind of way.Barry Lyndon: I’m sure I could watch this one a second time and enjoy it again. Kubrick rarely disappoints.Drugstore Cowboy: Entertaining if not exactly uplifting. Not sorry I watched itThe Killing Fields: I think I expected more. That’s my fault. But the poz at the end saps any good will I might have felt.The Accidental Tourist: It was too thoughtful and quirky to end as tritely as it did. But enjoyable for the most partShine: Held my attention at least. I play the piano. There are a lot of piano compositions that are written not to please the ear but rather to allow the pianist to show off. This movie contains many of them.The Insider: Compelling and watchable. Sent me on a deep dive about Lowell Bergman (portrayed by Al Pacino). Led me to this interview shamelessly titled: A Long March Through the Institution of Television Journalism. In which he states at about the 37 minute mark that 60 Minutes is “one of the most sophisticated forms of propaganda that has ever been developed,” and that it “appears to be nonfiction.”https://iis.berkeley.edu/publications/lowell-bergman-long-march-through-institution-television-journalismJoker: I don’t get what all the fuss was about. It didn’t have a plot

            I have to say that I gave up on The Killing Fields not even halfway through even though I was expecting a lot from it too.  These are minor spoilers, but what did me in was when the lead character got sent to the labor/re-education camp and I had to sit through all these voice-overs about how much he missed the reporter he worked for and how much he wanted to see him again and how the hope of seeing him again kept him going, etc.  Didn’t that guy have a wife and children he should have been more concerned about rather than some obnoxious a-hole reporter from the N.Y. Times?  It was absolutely ridiculous and I just quit watching at that point.

        On the subject of “Rob” DeSantis:https://twitter.com/_johnnymaga/status/1734766974729584759I really have to wonder if anyone else in U.S. history has completely ruined his political career as quickly as he has.  Not that many months ago, I would have said he seemed promising.  He was saying the right things and doing some right things, and I would have said he just might turn out to be one of the good guys.  But some big donors came around to hand him some cash and he instantly knifed Trump and his supporters in the back.  I now wonder whether he has any actual convictions at all.  And he’s also 40+ points back of Trump in his home state, so even the residents of FL don’t like him that much anymore.  I doubt he can even go back there with any hopes of getting elected or re-elected to anything.  For his sake, I hoped the donors handed him enough cash to retire or promised him some kind of golden parachute for turning Brutus because he’s done as a political candidate.

They take it to the track and for about 8 seconds it sounds pretty badass and is making a pretty good run. Then the engine blows. In the post-mortem they show the damage.

        Speaking of EVs, the Biden just crippled the entire government by ordering them to prioritize EV use on all official travel:

        Z-Man, if you liked “High Noon” a great deal, you should check out Peter Hyams’ space western “Outland,” which is basically a sci-fi remake of “High Noon.”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outland_(film)The film is set some indeterminate time in the future, when humanity is in the process of colonizing the solar system.  “Outland” stars Sean Connery (in one his best roles) as Federal District Marshal William T. O’Niel.  O’Niel has been assigned to a one-year tour of duty on Con-Am 27, a mining outpost located on Io, a moon of Jupiter.  O’Niel soon discovers that miners are dying for unexplained reasons and the deaths are linked to a criminal conspiracy in Consolidated-Amalgamated that he spends part of the film unraveling. Ultimately, Marshal O’Niel becomes such a hindrance to the conspiracy, that the station’s general manager arranges for a team of hired killers to be sent on the next shuttle run to murder O’Niel.

        You would be hard pressed to find a bigger EV skeptic than me.  Given the fact that we have all these old cities where many people live and apartments, I still hold out on the inevitable quick demise of the internal combustion engine has been greatly exaggerated.  The uptake of EVs has been far greater than I thought would happen.  Tesla has enough deposits to handle everything they can build for the next 2 years on the pickup truck.I still think there are a lot of bumps in the road ahead and that these so-called ICE car bans on new vehicles will inevitably be pushed back.  I think the writing is on the wall and they are going to ban ICE cars eventually and probably not so far into the future that it doesn’t really matter.  All the problems this will create is a feature, not a bug.

            One of the goals of the EV push is obviously to reduce the number of cars on the road.  Elites hate having to wait in traffic so if they reduce the number of cars on the road by 50% that would be a huge win for them.  Still they approach green energy with an insane zealotry and fanaticism like the supporters of John Brown.  Obvious failures and nonsense have no impact on them.  Wind turbine break down in 20 years or less and get buried when they are decommissioned, they don’t care.  They will cover a green field with solar panels that produce a pittance of power and think they are saving the planet.  Beyond the people who are gaming the system to get rich there are a lot of crazies.

                The “elites” (why are they “elite”?) know that there aren’t enough raw materials or electricity generating power for all the plebs to have EVs. It’s just another smelly WEF plan to get everyone stuck in place or using mass transport in their 15 minute hellholes.

            I know a lot of very smart people who think climate change is an existential and high priority problem. I think they also think EVs are a solution. I suspect a lot of them think that either:a) Moore’s Law applies to physicsb) We’ll spend a lot of money on battery tech and so we’ll solve all the problems because – we spent a lot of money on it.I don’t any of them have the first understanding of the insane number of materials required to build these things out at scale. So far, I’ve been wrong on the EV story in terms of adoption. Here is the thing that our side needs to understand. We can’t change their policies. They will do what they want.What we can do is understand the implications of them and try and make money off of them. Whether the project succeeds or fails, a huge sum of money is going to be spent digging up massive amounts of materials to make these things at scale and burning huge amounts of metallurgical coal turning them into batteries.I am not a fan of buying the battery metals, rather I think the Levi-Strauss approach of selling the miners the needed accessories is the winner here. Copper; Aluminum; Met Coal; Diesel; Heavy Equipment; Nickel are in my view the winners in this project. Probably Tesla has a lot of leverage on it, but I don’t touch that one.I think TPTB think this is going to be just as simple as some of the train engine conversions made in the mid 20th century. The EEV conversion is way beyond that scale. Let’s see. I’ve placed my bets. We need our folk to be thinking and acting this way. I agree with Sam Dickson that this catastrophe/survivalist thing is bad for us. Let’s get in there and compete and play all sides of things and get rich so we can use that money to wield power and give ourselves breathing room until we wield it.My $.02

                Most EV buyers &amp; drivers are affluent “educated” midwits who are scientifically illiterate and borderline innumerate. The same demographic as the people who make “climate change policy” so the massive push and adoption rate is to be expected.The cold hard reality of physics and thermodynamics are immutable laws however and we are starting to bump up against them… hard.Anyone who drives a “Green” car with “Zero emissions” as a virtue signal with no knowledge that they had to strip mine 50,000 tons of earth by diesel fume spewing machines to get the rare earth metals to make their car is going to believe nearly anything they are told. They also are not terribly concerned about the child slave laborers pulling those rare earth metal out of the little mining tunnels to make their super eco-friendly cars.It is the retarded leading the stupid at this point. But they are all true believers and have high paying make work government jobs in the six figure plus range so the band plays on with the lunacy.

                    I don’t think any EV owners actually realises that the electricity with which they charge their cars comes from power stations. More EVs means more power stations which means more oil, coal and uranium production. Like all “green” stuff, it’s not actually green at all. It just pushes the problem further away and makes people feel virtuous.

                    “Green” tech can serve two purposes. One, it can create a new sector similar to “defense” that is primarily about handing tax dollars to certain favored companies. Secondly, it serves as a massive “gullibility research program” that can identify and cultivate people to serve as tools for current and future campaigns of elite tyranny and terror against the general population.In the former case, just as it doesn’t really matter if the whizbang weapons actually work in a real war, it doesn’t really matter if the “zero carbon” cars are, in practice, getting the equivalent of 2 mpg once you factor in all the energy that goes into making and disposing of them.Well, this is probably the thinking of the more cynical factions of the elite anyway. It remains to be seen if the Ukraine disaster injects some reality into the “defense” sector or not. If it does, the future for ALL Fake ‘n Gay Tech may be in doubt.

                    It’s not terribly different from gun law regulations. I know a fair amount about guns. My “educated” friends that I went to college with will talk about the need for gun control. I’ll push them on specifics. They don’t know the difference between different calibers, or even semi-auto vs full auto (I love when news stories throw in the line “the shooter was using a fully semi-automatic weapon lol). Yet, these people think their opinion is valid, despite their vast ignorance on the topic or existing laws. Pretty much the same as EV and EV production.

                I hope the reality of electricity prices gets to them before they do too much more damage.  Up until recently, EVs have not posed a tax on electricity generation and the grid.To put it in perspective, the US alone burns 350 million plus gallons of gasoline a day.   That’s a lot of natural gas and coal.  What exactly we are going to do with all the gasonline that must be produced in order to produce diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, bunker fuel etc is also a problem.  This will be sold and burned, just not in our cars.  Maybe the Brazilians can stop destroying their land growing sugar cane and can instead import all the gasoline we produce.The build out that will be necessary to supply all this electricity is going to cost trillions of Dollars in both grid upgrades and additional electric generation stations.  Plus they will want to tax per kWh in order to get the equivalent of gas taxes they get now.

                    I think the hydrogen problem is fundamentally unsolvable.Even if they get what they call “red hydrogen” (making hydrogen from nuclear)  fully solved, it just doesn’t solve the problem, it only solves the supply problem.You just cannot get the range with hydrogen. It requires extremely high compression and special containers.  The hydrogen is so small it can leak out of just about any container. If it leaks into your garage, that could be extremely dangerous.I think the battery problem will be solved before the hydrogen problem could be solved. Both are just physics problems.  With gasoline, half the fuel is in the air around you and is totally free and has no weight. So it is highly unlikely batteries will ever reach the energy density or volumetric efficiency of gasoline.  With hydrogen you have the sourcing problem (cause we ain’t got no hydrogen) and the storage / energy density problem.  Liquefied hydrogen, I believe loses 30% of its energy to compression (to store a kWh equivalent requires 300 watt hours for the compression).  Of course, I’m no chemist. But it just seems to me that hydrogen will lose this battle.

            I can’t speak for the truck, but as for the cars, they are definitely not for everyone. And there should not be mandates. You have to be at a certain “station” in life to really benefit from owning a (good) EV. The three most important conditions are:1. Live in a relatively mild climate.2. Typical daily commute is under ~200 miles.3. Have a garage to park in overnight for nightly recharging.If you meet all three of the above conditions then, utility wise, a Tesla is a dream car.#1 gives you the advertised mileage.#2 and #3 mean you never have to stop at a “gas” (super charger) station. You plug it in when you get home and it charges while you sleep.I’ve had my Tesla for over a year now, and giving a flying fuck about the environment had absolutely no bearing on my decision to buy it.Here were my reasons.Little to no routine maintenance.Brakes last forever since most braking is regenerative.No oil changes or watching the oil.No oil leaks on the driveway.No transmission leaks on the driveway. In fact no transmission at all in the sense that there is any gear shifting.No watching the coolant.No coolant leaks on the driveway.No radiator hoses to burst.Except when driving cross country, never visit a “fueling” station.(driving from N.CA to S.CA only one 30 minute stop at a supercharger (e.g. Harris Ranch, or Mt. Madonna). Just enough time to get a coffee and pee.)EXTREME acceleration ability!!!! I never knew how gratifying it was to blow past people who would not let me merge in from an on ramp. Just hit the “gas” and they’re WAY back in my rear view mirror. Most ICE vehicles simply can’t challenge you in any way in regard to acceleration ability (I have to remember to put the accelerator into “chill” mode when I have passengers so they don’t get car sick. My wife has already complained about it!)

                Tesla acceleration numbers are impressive, no doubt.
That said, I’m skeptical of the powertrain over-engineering required for an operating regime that represents less than 1% of the vehicle’s use time.

                The ‘little to no maintenance’ of a Tesla or any other EV is vastly overstated.  There are a ton of things to maintain and repair in a Tesla or other EV, not the least of which is the brakes. (Nissan has the brake fluid service interval of 15 to 20k miles, for example).In most cases, the internal engine and transmission parts are good for the life of the car.  You do have to do oil/tranny fluid changes, but so long as you do them, they should be good till the car gets junked.  It’s all the other stuff. It’s the radiator, brake lines and calibers and master cylinder. It’s the rack, all the parts of the suspension, the water pump and many other things. All of which exist on EVs.  There are a ton of electronics to break in an EV that don’t exist on an ICE car.EVs just don’t make economic sense due to the enormous upfront cost difference between an EV and an ICE car.  Tesla does a trick accounting where it finds a car that costs roughly the same and then compares those costs.  This is, of course, retarded.  The equivalent EV to an ICE has about a 20-25k Dollar premium. You are just not going to save that money in the short period of time most people keep a new car.  If you got the power free, you will only save 1820 a year on gas at 3.50 a gallon at 25mpg at 13k miles per year and add on another 150 for oil changes you didn’t have to do. You are still under 2 grand a year and this is assuming you got free power, which you don’t.I don’t know specifically about Tesla, but most EVs have coolant. It’s just not engine coolant.  There is a loop, a water pump and a radiator/heater (because in some cars they do double duty in both heating and cooling).The gearbox has gear oil in it which can leak. Any gasket can leak.They are pretty good at low end torque/straight line acceleration.  If that’s why you have it, by all means enjoy it.  There is no better reason than “because it makes me smile”  All the other stuff is just rationalization.

                    It’s not really the *financial* costs savings of fuel and oil changes. It’s the *psychic* or *mental* costs of having to go out of one’s way to do them in the first place. Not procrastinate. I would always fill up, then wait ’til the car was going on fumes before filling up again because I found even detouring from by trip to get gas quite annoying. “Oh shit, the tank in on empty, I have to fucking stop and get gas.” “Maybe I better change my oil. It’s been 25,000 miles and it’s looking quite black …”

        Great podcast as usual. A few minor contributions related to today’s topics.Re Covid and masks. Medical professionals wear masks intermittently and change them habitually. During Covid, sheeple wore the same mask for days on end (if not the same homemade cloth mask for month’s on end). The latter became mutation incubators due to prolonged build-up of sputum, moisture, and elevated temperature from breathing. This resulted in an optimized petrie dish effect attached directly to your main ingestion ports of esophagus and bronchial tubes. IOW, you proactively turned yourself into a lab experiment in which diseases were mutated on your face and then directly injected into your body continuously. That was egregious malpractice, not humane medical preemption.Re: Cinema and the Kobiashi Maru test. The film Sophie’s Choice is an excellent exploration of this dilemma and worthy of your review skill and commentary.Merry Christmas to all.

            Additionally, the maskatards were inhaling particulate matter from the masks themselves, and depriving themselves of maximal oxygen for prolonged periods. Some still are. I’m not a pulmonologist, but I have to think this can’t be good for a body.

            During all of Oregon’s endless (I think 18 months) mask theater I made a point of *never* wearing a proper mask. Instead I went with a bandana loosely tied in the back and totally open at the bottom. Being allowed to go into stores looking like an MS-13 gangster about to rob the place *almost* made up for the hassle and tyranny.

                Pozymandias:  I initially wore a camouflaged pattern paintball mask (with all the little holes in it).  People didn’t know what to think (i.e. didn’t I realize it had holes in it, or did I realize and just not give a f**k).  Then I just took to wearing a standard paper one.  I’d keep it around my neck until I got to the door.  Then I’d pull it up over my mouth (never my nose) and drop it again once past the door.  I had one 20-something White guy hassle me at once store, but no one else ever said a word.

                    There were some people who got entrepreneurial about defeating the masks. There was a company that sold something they brazenly labeled “fake mask” that was pretty much what you describe. The idea was that it “met the requirement” for some sort of face diaper without actually doing anything.

        John Wayne was before my time and I never saw any of his movies until recently.  He embodied exactly the kind of masculinity that my liberal, west coast educators trained me to reject, starting with Sesame Street and that feminist movie they made us watch every year, “Free to Be You and Me.”In spite of the wooden acting, this scene makes me smile.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_JqltsgPMI can see why women would feel angry and threatened at this scene, because it is basically telling every man that “’No’ eventually means ‘yes,’ if you crush their resistance.”  However, the complexity of the female psyche is such that this is exactly what most of them really want, but only from a man who surpasses their high standards.

                C3s are nice too. They have those classic 70s lines and are still sexy. The only Vette model that really got it wrong was the C4 from the 80s. Very boring look / lines and absolutely anemic horsepower.
It has a strong heritage overall w/ only a few missteps. Contrast that with the poor Mustang that has been through the ringer many times over the decades. Different target markets of course, but most Corvettes have stood the test of time better.

The ‘96 LT4the last year of the C4 made 330 hp and 345 ft lbs of torque. The ZR1’s from ‘91 to ‘96 with the Lotus built LT5 dual overhead cammer made 375 hp.. The C4 was a completely ground up, reinvented world class sports car, from the integrated body – frame structure, to the front and rear suspension . The C4 was so dominant the SCCA disbanded its show room stock class because the Vette dominated. The Porsches  and Ferrari’s couldn’t compete!‘68 to ‘72 C3’s amazing, mid to late 70’s junk!Any C4 would destroy them in both straight line acceleration and especially handling.

                My buddy’s big brother, Marv, lent his classic ‘vette to us one time.  We spent the day driving up and down in front of the high school, laying rubber in the rain.
Marv also owned an English Ford that did a hundred, a van that we camped in on weekends, and a push-button Chrysler.  Oh yeah!
About a half-mile from getting to our neighborhood, the corvette’s clutch finally fried.  Fair bit of smoke. We walked the rest of the way but I decided not to accompany him home.

            I think the Javelin AMX is one of the best looking muscle cars ever produced in an American car company, certainly the best of the 70s.  I also love the big finned cars of the 50s with their huge hood emblems and gaudy chrome pieces and bumpers.Never was really into Corvettes.  I test drove one once and it had the heaviest clutch I’ve ever felt in my life. I kept stalling it because the clutch was just so hard to control.  This was during many years of daily driving nothing but sticks. I’m sure you would get used to it, but it just didn’t talk to me.  IMHO, the Corvette was always an overrated car.  In recent years they’ve gotten much better, but historically, they just weren’t very fast.

                They weren’t very fast compared to what exactly? Obviously you couldn’t handle the “heavy clutch,” I doubt you could handle anything with any real power…

                    Compared to its competition.Let’s see if you can, in the space of a single test drive adjust perfectly to a clutch 10x harder to push than the clutch you were driving the last 2 years and pulled into the dealership with.  Also, it wasn’t new, it was a few years old. The clutch was probably not OEM.I’ve driven plenty of fast cars including 10 second cars.Until recently, the Corvette was never a particularly fast car. There are grocery getters today that can blow the doors off of any stock 50s-80s Corvette.  They had other qualities that people like.  They look, sound and drive very well. What they were not great at was straight line acceleration.

                        Some years and some models were very fast and had great straight line acceleration. Many did not. Record that was made to be a sexy sports car not a street racing car.Corvette was America’s answer to the sports car. Cars like MG, Sunbeam, Triumph etcetera.I’ve owned at least 20 corvettes in my lifetime. Some were better than others speed wise all excellent handling wise. All we’re sexy and chick bait.I’ve also owned about 20 Rolls Royces and I can say the same thing about them. I’m sure the same thing can be said about most cars. I used to buy and sell English cars as a side hobby. Rolls, Bentley, Aston Martin, Morgan and the such. The finest car I ever owned was a 1965 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud III. Yeah I’ve found other Clouds and some left much to be desired. It depends on the car.Either way you look at it having a Corvette is having something that most people will never experience. It’s like popping the prom queen, everyone knows who she is but not everybody gets a ride.

        I prefer to not comment too often but my first visit every morning is to the zman.com. I also really like his Sunday comments. The week before last was especially rousing and laced with invective for our enemies.As far as today’s comments, although I have owned pickup trucks, they are a pretty poor choice for most needs. Farmers, ranchers, and deer hunters, sure, but for most other people, they suck. And actually, they are a comical choice for a lot of their owners. Little women and sawed-off boomers are especially comical with their big threatening PUs encapsulating themselves. Some of them need stepladders to get behind the wheel.I realized when Z was talking about John Wayne that I didn’t really care much for JW when I was a younger man but then after I got married I discovered that JW was my father-in-law’s favorite actor so I sort of got into him. I think the reason I didn’t care much for JW earlier in my life was that he reminded me of my h.s. principal. I was a f.u. in h.s. so we weren’t exactly on the same wavelength. But then later on I came to appreciate that society needs John Waynes.

                And John Wayne was a much better actor than he gets credit for.  This comes through in “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” and “The Searchers,” among other movies.

            Most of the people in my neck of the woods driving three-ton diesel Tundras are cardboard cowboys who’d be better off driving a Fit. For people who actually need those monster trucks, ok. But the rest are just taking up space, creating obstacles, and pumping pollution–air and noise–into the environment to compensate for a teenie weenie peenie.

        I should have submitted this as a question before the podcast, but I wonder what in the world has happened to Kamela Harris.  I half expect to see her picture on a milk carton  I believed the plan in 2020 was to have Biden resign after January 20, 2023 so that Kamela could finish Biden’s term and still be eligible for two full terms.  I admit that I was wrong, but what happened?  Is she simply so bad off the teleprompter that her earlier supporters have abandoned her?  Will she be removed from the 2024 Democratic ticket, if she’s so bad?  I appreciate any insight anyone can offer.

                    And her ascent to the heights is even more impressive when you consider that her face is below average.  In her prime, her selling points were just that she was not fat and willing to put out.
I would have assumed that Willie Brown could purchase and promote into his cabinet more attractive and less annoying prostitutes than Kamala.
Among politicians, she really stands out for her low intelligence and unusually repulsive personality.

            Exhibit A for the crisis of competence induced by diversity promotions, ideological promotions, and one party rule. Not that she’s the only one, just the most visible.
It’s also Exhibit A that competence is not a job requirement for the average US senator, although the party/caucus leaders are probably required to have some basic skills

        Electric vehicles have the soul of a computer which is no soul. mRNA vaccines are not established technology. I haven’t found any established uses of it in veterinary medicine either but even then, there are many medical differences between humans and other mammals (and between other species). On paper and in some trials it looks good. I was too slow to say to friends to avoid it. I also think your advice to take the vaxx if you felt like it was wrong in hindsight. But hindsight is Monday morning. I didn’t realize it at the time either. It’s not just New Zealand numbers. Ed dowd is not a doctor or even biologist but he is (presumably, I don’t know much about his career) good with numbers. And there are others to support him. Their conclusions are that mid life deaths are significantly up. Again the professional medical literature is captured by Globohomo so hard to come by “just the facts”. But I think the minimum realistic estimate is that there is something seriously wrong with the vaxx. That’s the floor estimate.Agree on Russia. I’m a little fed up with small country people who hate Russia even though I am in a small country right now. The little guy chip on the shoulder gets oldYeah, think that’s it. Good show, thanks for the hard work you do. Hope the people here are getting in the seasons spirit. And oh yeah, also agree on politics, whatever benefits our side. But don’t take it too seriously, it’s all rigged. After all, there’s real money and power involved

        Regarding Ukraine, the ignorance plus wild propaganda on view in the media has been staggering.  I have close connections with people from eastern Ukraine, who are Russian-speakers.  One of them still living there, in a location occupied by Ukrainian government, is extremely guarded about what she can say for fear of retaliation from authorities or neighbors.  Yet she manages to convey some of what is happening, including, of course, the intimidation, which has been widespread.  Men in her city, from very young men to slightly elderly, are in hiding or have fled to avoid what I guess should be called impressment into the military, and then into the horrible meat-grinder of the front.  And it seems that so many civilians just want this war to be over.  Although that might not be so much the case in Galicia.And some key factors rarely discussed in western media, which many here probably do know about, include the atrocities and fighting occurring in the Donbass, Odessa and elsewhere since the “Maidan” in 2014.  And the possibility of peace negotiations not long after the Russian invasion, which was nixed by Boris Johnson.  And the blatant disregard of the earlier Minsk accords.I haven’t checked the British Telegraph site for some days, but throughout the war they were constantly trumpeting how Ukraine was on the verge of massive victory, Putin was on the verge of collapse, etc., etc., when this was clearly untrue based on the information I was getting, not just directly from Ukrainians but from other media less prominent in the West.So many young men have died in this awfulness.  I can hardly stand thinking about it.

                    1660please:  Charles II was far more complex than he is usually credited with.  Although a libertine in his personal habits, despite all his mistresses he never tried to divorce barren Catherine of Braganza and neither encouraged nor tolerated disrespect towards her.  He was a very canny political operator dealing with a difficult parliament and a divided populace in many ways.  He trod a careful path and ought to be fully credited with restoring stability and the monarchy after civil war and Cromwell.For various reasons I developed an interest in his courtier John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester and his poetry (English lit major for my sins) and combined that with classes on England under the Tudors and Stuarts.  Fascinating time period.

                        Yes, I agree, 3g4me.  I’d rate Charles II as one of the better English kings, without a doubt.  He had a dangerous tightrope to walk, and he did it very well overall.  He didn’t allow an overreactive purge against the Roundhead types.He steered England through a very dangerous time, within and without.  With all the troubles during his reign, there were so many more dangerous, damaging directions England could have gone, and it’s understandable that he was cosy with the French.  And he showed good leadership, for example during the terrible London fire.I think it’s a very sad story with his brother, who was very well-meaning and capable, and who could have very good relations with men like William Penn.

            Musk should be in prison for fraud and be held personally criminally (and financially) liable for every death tied to “full self driving”
A 10 thousand Dollar software update called “Full Self Driving” would lead any reasonable person to believe that “full self driving” (costing 10-15 grand) is capable of operating the vehicle.
It is infuriating that the NHTSA allows this state of affairs to continue.

        Absolutely right about part of the Covid vaccine plan being to make it an annual shot like the flu shot.  I heard a couple different doctors say that when it was first introduced. Moderna was clearly planning on it and both they and Pfizer look like they are going to struggle long term as a result of banking on this.  A surprising number of people are still getting it even though it is an undeniable failure.  If you want to make them angry, tell them they are religious zealots.

        “Cinematic onanism” is a howler. The mental image of you staking out a fortune teller’s emporium with a notepad in your hand also made me laugh. I’m totally with you about Jimmy Stewart. He’s the Tom Hanks of his day sans the pedophilia (as far as we know), and equally grating and overrated.Excellent podcast, and props for calling out the cowardly Johnny-Come-Latelys like Caldwell and Murray. This scenario plays out so often: unknown yet bright, perceptive people create and envision, and then grifters show up to steal their thunder, often if not usually with great success. Caldwell and Murray are little more than pseudo-based Charlie Kirk despite their pretensions.As for Trump, the courts last week may have thrown the GOP into the briar patch. He now may not be convicted before next November. If that is the case and Republicans still remove Trump from the ballot, their recent very public betrayals of their putative voters make even more sense–they also know this is their last national election. It was a long con, hand them that.Things are moving rapidly and dramatically, but Covid remains the defining event of our lifetimes. Yes, it is being swept under the rug and ignored, but so many were adversely affected by the fraud it will remain a raw wound for generations. Along with the open border, the Covid lockdowns and vaccines marked the federal government’s full break with the American public. This happened long ago but certain events always are markers that make something official. As I noted in a reply below, Greg Johnson also was a Covidian as well as a Ukraine War supporter. Bear that in mind when you read him. He’s a bright guy with daft ideas. We see that a lot now.Again, great stuff and Merry Christmas.

                Just to be clear…
Greg Johnson is a degenerate sodomite.
This must not be forgotten in any discussion of his actions, views, or statements.  Homosexuals are inherently untrustworthy and should be viewed with disgust and aversion in all cases.  They should be shunned and ridiculed; never give their pronouncements any credence.

        Could not agree more aboutPale Riderand how many good things Eastwood had going on in that film.
I think it is underappreciated because it was released in 1985 and its sombre, earnest tone stood in direct opposition to the zeitgeist and popular culture of the day.
Had it been released in the 90s, it would easily be seen as one of Eastwood’s top 5 films and a worthy companion toUnforgiven.

            Pale Rider &gt; Unforgiven. Unforgiven was Oscar bait.
It had all the elements: magical black friend, underdeveloped and stereotypical young gun character, and the women (“whores” as they were called) were seen as denied justice even though Little Bill and the saloon owner punished the men who cut up the lady. Did the men deserve death for that? No.
Total Oscar bait. Eastwood’s worst movie by then.

                    Yeah it’s all in the ending. I think Eastwood does an excellent job of portraying a genuine bad ass type. He looks like sh!t at first, gets beat up by another slightly less tough guy (Hackman) because he’s not yet in that dark side of his character. Once he’s there he is genuine. I’ve met some tough guys who you’d never have guessed. When they get turned on they eat the tough guy acts, who tend to be front loaded about their toughness, for breakfast. Eastwood hit that nail

                When I saw Unforgiven I thought it was the final piece of the trilogy. High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider and the Unforgiven. Over the years this has felt more right to me. Eastwood knew it was his last Western and maybe his last film as an actor. It was closing the show on himself as a Western star and as a director. By itself it is not as good as the other films, but when viewed in the context of the prior two films it is a helluva goodbye.

                Agreed. It’s the only Clint Western I’ll not watch twice. It has all the flaws you note, and on top of that, it’s dull. But the critics love it because it caresses their ideological undercarriage.

                Enjoyed the Western realism in Unforgiven.  But you’re right, it’s another movie loaded with propagandistic elements.
The film turns on revenging a woman due to mistreatment by the Ebil White Mans — offending the female being the #1 plot device and excuse-for-violence in modern films and television programs.  Programs.  Programs.  Hell-o gynarchy.
Then the righteous black is mistreated by the Ebil White Mans.  Then the Good White Mans punishes the Ebil White Mans, who had recently punished the prior Ebil White Mans.

            It is an excellent review and I agree completely when he said we are never seeing actors like Eastwood again. That was an amazing performance considering he directed himself in that film. Preacher is both terrifying and comforting, which is close to impossible.

                    I knew a Hollywood lawyer who did legal work for one of Eastwood’s companies. This guy did not care for actors very much, but he actually liked working for Eastwood. He did not waste anyone’s time like everyone else in Hollywood. It’s funny. This guy hated his work, mostly because he had to be around actors. Funny how things go sometimes.

            Johnson both supported Covidism and the Ukraine war. That’s 0-2. He’s a sharp guy in many respects, but when it comes to something big he’s not to be trusted based on that record. His ethnostate plans, for example, are uber LARPing. Again, he’s an intelligent guy and a very good writer who needs to be taken with a metric ton of salt.

                Jack Dodson:  Johnson banned me during Covid (in response to a mild comment on someone else’s post that made no mention of Johnson himself).  I had just paid for 3 years’ membership.  I still get begging emails from him – classless and careless.

                        Lineman:  We had a quiet holiday, thank you Lineman.  Still trying to establish new traditions with the immediate family now in different households and states.  Absent constant concerns about my kids and living in a failing GAE, I am quite happy in my marriage and my new rural environment.  And the deer love me, sucker that I am for feeding them daily – opened the blinds this morning to 8 of them waiting out front.

                    I got banned for making fun of jim goad for writing a series of articles where he did this “woe is me, I’m not a white nationalist &amp; I’m oppressed by the counter currents commenters” shtick.Somebody didn’t like it when I asked jim where on the doll the commenters touched him, my comment was wiped &amp; my account was banned.I was feeling a bit snippy since they gypped me out of that ‘free’ book for signing up to their subscription before the cutoff date. After a few weeks I asked when they’d be sending the book &amp; they claimed I didn’t send the money before the cutoff. They cashed the check ten days before that date, I sent a screenshot of my banking app showing the date the check was cashed to prove it &amp; they ignored me.I suppose that’s what I get for trusting a site run by fruity sprites, won’t be making that mistake again.

            I saw people like him by the ton during Convid: super-intelligent types who fell hook, line and sinker for the lies. There is intelligence of the mind and intelligence of the heart. Intellectuals nearly always lack the latter. Meanwhile, many of the folks the Greg and his caste look down on, like my local mechanic, barber and cleaning lady, all knew it was lies from the get-go.

            Greg Johnson is that professor you had at university who can give you a perfectly good grounding in the classics, but is a crazy Marxist when it comes to politics. As Z mentions, white nationalism is an oxymoron outside of the North American context, with the Ukraine Conflict being a perfect illustration of that. But if you accept Greg’s argument that only the Ukrainians are “white,” then it is even more tragic that most of those killed and wounded to date have in fact been Ukrainians, including members of the Donbas militias fighting on the Russian side. It brings to mind the conundrum faced by all the social justice warriors in the latest Gaza flare-up, where the rule seems to be, “When in doubt, back the Jews.” Given the ethnic make-up of the current U.S. and Ukrainian administrations, that seems to be how Greg resolves the inherent contradictions there, as well.

                    Z summarized Greg’s position quite well. Mark Collett has conceded that a country the size of Russia on the Eurasian landmass will perforce be multi-racial. Their debate on the Ukraine Conflict can be viewed on Odysee.

                ProZNoV:  Most people don’t know enough to see how close they are in practice if not in theory.  Very similar dietary laws, very similar rules on women’s dress (one mandates the head veil and the other a wig; one uses a big cloak and the other requires high necks, long sleeves and almost ankle length skirts).  Both require female ritual cleansing.  Both separate the sexes during worship.  Etc., etc.

                “Pre Zionism, Jews and Muslims got along pretty well in the Sand Lands.”
This point fails to get sufficient attention. Prior to the establishment of the State of Israel, the United States also had excellent relations with the Arab nations. Again, that seldom gets mentioned. It really wasn’t until the ’67 war that the United States fully cozied up to Israel, in no small part due to it flirting with Marxism from the time it was founded until the early stages of the Cold War. Those who warned founding Israel was a mistake, Jews and Gentile alike, were proved right.

                Well, at best Jesus was half Jewish through his mother.  God the Father is not Jewish.
And while Jesus was raised culturally Jewish under Herod’s kingdom, given that he was from Galilee, “the land of the Gentiles”, there is a strong possibility that he was not ethnically Jewish.  And he certainly spoke out against the ridiculousness of the Jewish elite.

        Being a solid Gen X kid, I appreciate all the Eastwood Westerns (Josey Wales and TG,Tb,&amp;TU the best of all), but I do have to decry the focus on those Golden Age films for just a little recognition of Westerns from the late 1980s/1990s, which the best of should be in the pantheon.Three AmigosYoung GunsTombstoneLonesome DoveWild BillDeadwood (not technically 1990s but close enough)
Black Robe and Last of the Mohicans are Westerns of a kind, so also deserve inclusion.

                True, but I put an arbitrary cutoff of the genre in the mid-80s as separating them for me as a mid-Xer-The Long Riders and Silverado properly belong to a late 1970s style, whereas Young Guns or Tombstone feel very different.

            Three Amigos is a comedy farce—not a western in the sense of the American myth.  It deserves no inclusion into the “Western” canon, but it is a good movie for laughs.

                    Once the empowered Mary Sue shows up to teach the men a lesson about manhood, I’m out.  And that’s most of them now.
Also out when I’m ten episodes into a decent series, and suddenly the protagonist starts kissing on some other dood, yeah right homosexuality was just SO common amongst medieval knights etc.
Hard to enter back into the film when suddenly I want to strangle the people responsible.

            “Black Robe” is, I think, one of the very best depictions of an historical subject in movies.  Ignoramuses hate how it shows what American Indians were really like in the 17th century.  And how white colonists were not raving, bloodthirsty maniacs.
Ever since I noticed how TV “westerns” so often had anti-white messages, even from the late 1950’s onwards, I’ve avoided movie westerns later than the era of John Ford.  I don’t deny that there are good exceptions, though.

            “Last of The Mohicans” was a fantastic movie and yes, it does deserve a place on the list! Clannad – the group that was featured on the soundtrack – made an appearance on their farewell tour in my area this past fall, although because of a scheduling problem, I was unable to see them.Thank you Z for your thoughts on why you enjoy those movies, as those were views that I had not considered before. Both of the Eastwood films you spoke of were classics in their own right. Several films that come to mind for me are; “Excalibur”. That movie has so many elements of why we Europeans are the way we are and our myths/ethos, I wonder if Boorman the director was specifically going for this, or everything just happened to come out that way. An all-star cast is also a contributing factor, Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson, a young Helen Mirren (Always a saucy addition and perfect for the part of Morgana) and last but not least, Nichol Williamson as Merlin – who forever ruined the part for everyone who came after him! One of the final scenes of the movie is where Arthur and his knights ride out to meet Mordred’s army and “O Fortuna” is softly playing in the background. As they ride through a cherry orchard, the music comes to life as the trees blossom as the company rides past. Arthur’s battle standard of the dragon waving in the breeze, ones blood gets going as you realize that this representation of our people is something that is so unique that this is why the lesser peoples we are forced to share our land with are so hell-bent on tearing it down! What they were able to achieve in that movie using just lighting techniques alone is noteworthy. Several co-workers are my age and also love the movie. As we were leaving work a few weeks ago, the weather was gloomy with heavy fog. My co-worker Laura turned to me and said, “Someone has summoned the dragon”. It’s reassuring to know that there are fellow culturally related people out there!“The Keep” a movie that really did not follow the book it was based on and seemed poorly edited. Great special effects and a fantastic soundtrack from Tangerine Dream made up for the other shortcomings.“Highlander”! “There can be only one!” will forever be part of my lexicon! The opening battle between the MacLeod’s and the Frasier’s started me on my path of exploring the Scots and related peoples. A re-make is in the works and Henry Cavill will be playing the role of Connor MacLeod and the original soundtrack from Queen will remain unchanged! From what I’ve read, the movie will more closely follow the book authored by Gregory Widen.“Dune” always difficult to do, as there are so many sub-plots going on that if the movie was to follow the book, it would be about eleven hours long. I have been disappointed with every movie/series that has come out because I read the book back in ’79 – a gift from my father – and as usual with reading, one has one’s own ideas of what the characters appear/sound like that the productions rarely live up to.Z, I have to respectfully disagree on the model of Vette that you mentioned. Yes the early years of the C-3 generation were nice (up until they replaced the chrome bumpers with body-colored plastic, ruining the lines.) one of our old neighbors in the first apartment my family lived in had a ’69 coupe. It was that dark hunter green with a saddle leather interior, what a beauty to behold! My favorite is still the C-2 generation, 1963 – 1967! My father just finished restoring his ’63 coupe. It’s a split-window, fuelie and all the numbers match! Although it isn’t the original color (It was white when he bought it and he painted it red instead.) and the side pipes really don’t play well with the fuel injection. Speaking of cars with soul, I believe Chevy announced that they will be bringing back the Chevelle SS! Coupe and drop-top will be on offer!In addition to which, talk about a gorgeous driving machine, this brand will be making a comeback after almost seventy years of being dormant.https://www.cleveland.com/community/2023/11/the-past-becomes-the-future-with-new-version-of-1930s-packards.htmlMy maternal grandfather had one and I wish I had more pictures of it!Anyway, Z and everyone else and their families, do have a Merry Christmas and God bless!

            I’m a stone cold Gen X’er but I never had any desire to watch the contemporaneous Westerns of my youth.  I can’t explain why.  Once I got into my 20’s, I began to take in the genre, but generally only the older ones.  I still haven’t watched more than a couple of the Westerns produced in my lifetime.One title I haven’t seen mentioned yet is 1957’sThe Big Country, starring Peck, Heston, Ives, and the gorgeous Jean Simmons.  Peck plays the protagonist, an East coast dandy from the future Lagos on the Chesapeake, come west to reunite with his future wife, whom he met back home.  She’s the daughter of a cattle baron (Major Terrill, played by Charles Pickford), a genuine Westerner, who’s in the process of trying to block access to water from his closest rival, Burl Ives, whose clan lives a more down-home, clannish existence.  As the movie progresses, Peck takes in the often inhumane rapacity of his future father-in-law.  He’s committed himself to adopting the lifestyle of his new country, and has to decide to what degree he wants to emulate either Pickford or Ives.If you want to dip your toes in the water, I’d recommend the following scene, in which Ives crashes a party that Pickford’s throwing and delivers one of the best verbal beatdowns ever put to film.  If this was a pro-wrestling promo, it would be ranked as one of the greatest of all time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW2JONQ2k3c

                Because there’s more than money involved. Harvard’s prestige and influence as the premier producer of the elite in all the institutions of Clown World is at stake, and that is more threatening than donors pulling funds. They can source their spiteful mutants from other places than Harvard, which diminishes Harvard’s power. And power is the real coin of the realm.

                    I’m impressed with how tight Harvard and Yale, the latter of which is not really a top school for the sciences, run entrance to the top clouds. That latest female SCOTUS justice was the first in like decades that didn’t get her JD from one of H&amp;Y. With at least 20 serious law schools in the country, probably more but at least 20, that’s remarkable and suggests a problem. Trump was the first POTUS since Reagan with no H&amp;Y paper on his wall.

        A question was asked concerning the VAX and the immunity given to the drug companies at one of the debates by Megyn Kelly.   Ramaswamy answered that the drug companies should not have been given immunity and then he gave a long answer about corruption.
The question was entirely cut out by the network and they went to a long commercial break.   The segment was recorded by some reporter and I saw it.  I can’t remember the source.  If I find it I will post it.
So apparently no.  That subject will not be allowed even if it hurts Trump.

            Immunity from suit is much older than Covid fiasco.  At least started with Swine flu nonsense in Carter days.  Also, it’s not so much that there is no recourse for the public injured, but that the alternative government agency and fund to address injury is a farce.

                    Wild Geese:  Funny to note how much my opinion of previous presidents has changed since I truly became a dissident and have learned so much from so many here.  I used to loathe Nixon and liked Reagan.  Now I dislike both but for entirely different reasons than in the past (now know far more about who signed what that affected domestic life rather than focusing on foreign policy).

                Yes and technically in the case of the Covid jabs there is a remedy. An act of fraud cannot legally be indemnified.    These covid jabs were a fraud from the get go with more coming to light all the time.

                    Fraud?  That’s not true at all.  Everyone knows the jabs are safe and effective and provide lasting immunity.Now go get your booster(s), because the jabs are no longer effective or provide lasting immunity.

        The Wild Bunch is the Best Western, and I will stand on Clint Eastwood’s coffee table in my cowboy boots and say that.

            The title is terrible, though. The Wild Bunch suggests a bunch of wild-and-wooly bozos who get likkerd up at the Long Branch and then go toilet paper the parson’s house. Kind of like the Apple Dumpling Gang or suchlike. The title is entirely incongruous with the grim and bloody nature of the film.

            Big Peckinpah fan here.  As a classic western, I’d give the nod to Ride the High Country.
But for my money, the best single sequence is in the admittedly uneven Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, the one where Garrett and Sherriff Baker mix it up with some members of the Kid’s old gang:
“Us old boys ought not to be doing this to each other. Ain’t that many of us left.”
If your throat isn’t catching watching Slim Pickens bleed out, I don’t know what to tell you.

        Watched Rear Window for the second time in my life. I usually don’t yell at the screen much but this pushed my limits. Everything is implausible especially a world that is heaven for peeping toms. By the way Stewart was 46 in this and I believe Kelley was mid twenties although he looked older.  I want the kind of insurance that pays for daily visits to get massages and meals prepped daily while I convalesce. The ending was stupidly wrapped up all nice and tidy with a full confession on the way to the police station. Finally, constantly thwarting a long term relationship with Grace Kelley a beautiful socialite because he didn’t think they were compatible was absolute insanity and would never happen.Finally, google image the movie Damnation Alley from the 70s. That’s basically Musk’s truck only it has some serious power. Out of the realm of sci-fi and Minecraft do we now get serious product development now.

                    Agree, though always enjoy Thelma Ritter and Burr made a great heavy.  BF has selected Grace Kelly as the most beautiful of all the Movie Stars and she was breathtaking in the Edith Head wardrobe.  What she was doing stuck on a whiny bore like Stewart is beyond me.  Edith said Kelly and Cyd Charisse were the only people she did not have to alter designs for.

                When Hitchcock made RW, American audiences were different.  Apples and oranges comparing it to today’s standards in film plot.  It’s one of those movies I find interesting only when juxtaposed with today’s technology and society—and then only worth seeing “once” more in that light.

                I find that I cannot tolerate most movies at all anymore.  The main reason is that I see the hidden psychological poison that the movie producers are trying to trick whites into swallowing.But a second reason is that I can’t suspend my disbelief about how romance and male-female power dynamics are portrayed.  In so many of these films, the male protagonist has a romance with an attractive woman who wouldn’t even deign to spit on him in real life.Woody Allen is the best example, where, in every movie, he has a hot shiska girlfriend, but that is only the most egregious.It’s like watching a movie where the basic laws of physics are defied without explanation.  I just can’t do it anymore.

                        Of course I agree, but if all the guy has is money, then she will probably treat him disrespectfully and even cheat on him eventually.The simplicity of the “rich, famous guy always gets the chicks” explanation was complicated by the divorces of Brad Pitt and Tom Brady.Their two cases signify to me that, once a man is married to a woman that he loves, he is far more committed and vulnerable than the woman, who is always easily dissatisfied and ready to leave.  In short, men are far more romantic than is commonly believed and women are far more mercenary.

                    What you are describing Line is just an example of the hacks writing screenplays these days in Hollywood.  I can’t stand it either, it’s all so boring and unrealistic.  TV shows are that way as well.  What really gets to me is repeatedly reverting to “deus ex machina” in story lines to get the good guy out of a troubling situation.  Audience seems to never grow tired of this ploy, but it is a simplistic today as it was to the ancient Greeks.

                We’re supposed to get the impression that Stewart has something wrong with him that he’s hiding, so his emerging hobby will look to us like an expression of a sinister secret self. Something in his true nature is bad enough that in order to avoid showing it, he rejects everybody’s dream girl.As he and we get caught up in plot events, that idea is abandoned. We can think that surviving the story has cured whatever’s wrong with him or taught him a liberating lesson, but we’re not supposed to think about it at all, just submit emotionally to the ending.I don’t think Hitchcock cared if anything in his movies was realistic or even plausible. They were made to be experienced in real time, one time, not analyzed.But he also basically invented modern film analysis by describing his own movies with such clinical detachment and accuracy, so…

        I heard that John Wayne had a clause in his contract that said he would win every shootout he had, and his character would never “backshoot” a man, despite that being a much more realistic depiction of how business got done back then. I like him in “The Shootist,” where he’s a little wearier, older, more ambivalent. There’s a story about him and Jimmy Stewart (who was half-deaf) doing multiple takes in that office scene. The director finally lost his head and said, “Do it better!” and Wayne turned to him and said, “If you want it better, get yourself some better actors.”His lowest point was probably “The Green Berets.” That movie was basically Mystery Science Theater fodder for soldiers in Vietnam at the time. Gus Hasford, the marine who wrote “The Short Timers’ (the basis for “Full Metal Jacket”) said everyone in the theater laughed the whole way through. There were pine trees visible in what was obviously Fort Benning but was supposed to be Vietnam. I’m sure the Duke had to do several retakes for shouting “Eat lead, Japs,” before remembering he was supposed to be fighting gooks. His drunken speech at a college commencement (available on YouTube) is worth seeking out.

            Well with that old stuff, ya gotta remember that they were different times. It was a different planet.One of the most fiendish, despicable Hollywood tropes of our day is this idea of the anti-hero. It has literally allowed villains and turdies to be remade as heroes. The jews have been the obvious major beneficiaries, but the blacks and queers and now the trannies have made out like bandits too. It shows up in Hollywood and the box office and then slides into our cultural narratives. Just yesterday our leaders decided there was no difference between anti Zionism or antisemitism.I watch movies now and cheer for the bad guys if I watch them at all.In John Wayne’s day there were good guys and bad guys. It was simple and their conflicts were simple. The conflicts had boundaries. We were much better people then, living in better times.Today there is supposed to be a conservative case for gay marriage, multiculturalism, race pandering, judeo-Christianity etc ad nauseum. In our days it seems a principled stand is impossible because our adversaries are all anti-heroes with “layers” and “complexities”. It’s so bad nowadays that we don’t tell great stories or make great films anymore. Disney pumps out filth and crap so bad that even the kids won’t watch it.For all their faults and flaws, I am just fine with Hitchcock and John Wayne and the rest.

                John Wayne was honest about Green Berets.  The film was controversial *before* release even.  Wayne stated that the anti-war rhetoric and demonstrations were one sided.  He wanted to show what he felt was the other side.  He was the proverbial “hard hat” stepping of the crane to punch out some sign holding “hippies”.  The movie was exactly in the mold of the pro war propaganda films of WWII and Korea, and marked an important turning point in American culture.  Can you name any such films since about any of our imperial conquests?

            I saw The Shootist in the theater when it was released. I saw it by myself and the theater was mostly empty. It was the middle of the day and Westerns, as well as Wayne, we no longer big attractions. I recall enjoying it very much, even though I was not a John Wayne fan. I should watch it again and see if I like it. The film has grown in reputation over the years.

                I was only 12 years old when The Shootist came out — I saw it when it was released, too, and also quite enjoyed it. I get the impression that you are a year or two younger than me. Were you just a little tyke at the time?

            The biggest gaff in Green Berets is the ending scene where Wayne  talks to the little Vietnamese boy whose American adopted father fails to return from his last mission.
Boy: What will happen to me now?Wayne: Well son, that’s what this war is all about.
This scene is filmed in front of a setting sun over the great expanse of ocean next to the Green Beret operations base.  However, the ocean along Vietnam is in the East and the sun rises there, *not* sets.  It sets over the great expanse of jungle to the West.    😉
