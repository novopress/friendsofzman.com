        “The thieves and thugs will still be thieves and thugs!”  What you’re saying here is that we can have exactly the same problem for less money.  Which sounds pretty fucking good to me.  Libertarians do not have some romantic notion that it’s only laws that make people criminals; we just want to be pragmatic about which laws are worth enforcing and how.

        The fact that most drug offenders are not nice has nothing whatsoever to do with the irrationality of the drug laws themselves. Punish the thieves and thugs, severely. I’m fine with that. Some thieves and thugs will also be drug offenders – I’m fine with that, too. Nail ’em.
But jailing some kid for a joint or an ounce of pot? Silly and wasteful on both ends, meaning the cop’s time and the kid’s future. And our tax money.

        Ahem…. “life on the lam.”  No need to be sheepish about correcting it.
