        Wow, for someone who writes well, I’ve seldom seen a worse understanding of how Christianity works – ever.That said, the Clintons are sort of the high priests (in an old-Israel sort of way) of the new Progressive church….what to do when you find them with their fingers in the kitty? (Yeah, that was a double entendre.)Unless the Progressive can figure out a way to bring them to task without ripping the entire ideology in half, there’s little hope the rest of either the political class or the chattering classes will ever take them seriously, and will view them as only a new approach to revenue generation.

        The Clintons personify the Hollywood maxim, “Nothing succeeds like excess.”
The press has been selling its collective soul for a mess of pottage since 1992. I would ask the question, How do they sleep at night? But I know the answer is “comfortably”.

        The Clinton’s to me have always represented the personification of the worst excesses of the baby boomer  generation. They are glaring hypocrites who harp on about helping the poor while they steal everything in sight. They are amoral and shallow , papering over rape and thievery. Bill is a creature of the media age, a sociopath who charms the dopes in the press. His “wife” is a talentless, power mad shrew who long ago sold her soul for a ride on the presidential jet. Even their daughter is an entitled brat with little redeeming grace. The curtain needs to drop on this sad saga soon.

        Seems to me the Clintons aren’t much more corrupt than the rest. The Cult is a bourgeois faith. The greatest bourgeois virtue is careerism. The cult’s morality is a career advancement tool. Clintonian corruption is understood to be something you shouldn’t get caught doing, but a perfectly admirable way to get ahead in the world.I maintain that Fake Indian’s tall tales about her ancestry — including the classic bourgeois careerist move of plagiarism — are seen by the Faithful as a virtuous act.Nearly nothing is more virtuous than a $300k job at Harvard. Anything that gets you there is virtue on stilts. They’ll tell you the same about Hill’s bribe-taking at State: She’s innocent because she was forced by circumstances. The circumstances were that somebody offered her money, and turning down money is unimaginable.
