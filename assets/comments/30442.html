        I‚Äôd guess that Nietzsche was a weak man who longed for strong man to kick him round the place.
Strong men(bullies) tend to end up with sharp pointy objects sticking in their backs.

        A Zero Sum Religion. It sort of sounds rather ancient. Winning is the only thing‚Ä¶ there are only winners‚Ä¶ second place is only the first loser. The smart and powerful believing they are entitled to run a society is not a new idea. It is clanish and tribal. The best warriors and hunters were naturally put in the top positions within the group. Or they took the positions they wanted and there was no one strong enough to take their spot. To elucidate and make it a foundational principle (religion or belief system) of a society in which strength is an existential requirement would only be natural. The ability to protect the weak is a luxury that an affluent and civilized society can have. It exemplifies the best of humanity. But kindness and generosity do not guarantee a civilizations survival.Consider living in the time of Genghis Khan.  If you did not want to be part of the Mongol empire you better have a civilization that lives to fight. The only way to do that is place the warrior on a pedestal and worship him. Make it the highest social good to die in battle for the group. The weak will not be held in high esteem.The future is shaping up to be chaotic and potentially devolve into anarchy. It will require a lot of strength just to survive. The religion of X may make more sense than it appears at the moment.The safety and prosperity of our age is an anomaly in history. Things will change.

        Great post. I didn‚Äôt follow the end piece of the allegory, about the world-destroyer faction (Greta Thunberg-style ‚Äútrue believers?‚Äù) provoking a siege by whipping up fear accidentally in the aggressive-debauchery faction (BlackRock-BLM combine? perhaps just nonspecific little Eichmanns of govt/academia bureaucracy participating in the religious rites professionally) which then ruins the good thing both had going‚Äî but the bandwagon bloc always just mouths the words/nods their heads to get bennies, I don‚Äôt think they ever view their bedfellows the ideological nutters as a resource to raid; I guess they (or their celebrity tribune) would fight if pushed. Anyway you got the beginnings here of a pretty funny ‚ÄúZarathustra On Management‚Äù frequent-flyer book for aspiring VP‚Äôs of marketing

        Forgive my railing, folks, but I think this is a splendid summary of the post-Christian order.The hierarchies we were raised on?They‚Äôre gone.  The order, the environment we‚Äôre in- this is new.The table‚Äôs been flipped.Today‚Äôs illuminates how our rulers think. Let us meet fire, then, with fire.Let the weepy submissives be taken, as is their lot.  They can‚Äôt be saved.You wanted Hard Men?  Nietzsche, like Uncle Adolph, is a saint of the Church Militant.  Caucasia Vult!From the Web:‚ÄúWhite Unity will become an emergent property in multiracial sh*t stews when Whites begin building alliances along interWhite tribal/ethnic lines.‚Ä¶we should do more to promote alliances and see if that doesn‚Äôt bring success to the Race before all out unity.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs in response to the ‚ÄúItalians and Irish aren‚Äôt real Albion Americans‚Äù nitwittery.  Europe must become Europe again- that is, the Pan-White Ummah of Europa, the Commonwealth, the Caustizos, and the US has plenty enough diversity within practical limits.Demanding perfection first- that there can be only One Church!- is itself a violation of God‚Äôs laws.  Such opportunistic ambition betrays the Whole.  I can trust an Italian, or Irish, or German, or Syrian, a Southron, or  Canadian to be as fair and friendly to my kids and kin as I would be to his.‚ÄúWhites ‚Äî Hajnal Whites, precisely ‚Äî evolved a Mr Rogers ethnodenialism that worked very well when it was contained within an all-White European continent, and particularly within an all-White Northwest European region.The costs of ethnodenialism are reduced to near zero when the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù looks, acts, and thinks as you do, and is equally ethnodenialist. You can do business with a person like that. You can marry your daughter off to the family of a person like that. You can enjoy a backyard barbecue with a person like that. You can trust your kids with a teacher like that.There‚Äôs no need to distrust that kind of ‚ÄúOther‚Äù because he‚Äôs just as trustworthy as you; he‚Äôs just as likeable as you.‚ÄùRemember, only 3% of children today are White.The tables were flipped in this fashion:‚Äú‚Ä¶the two wars were a suicidal move on the part of all whites.‚Ä¶ in 1910 europe basically had nearly completed control of the global but for a few places and to be european was to bestride the world as a demi-god.shattered, the empires broke down.disillusioned by the destruction the people began to doubt the value of their civilization which opened the door to guilt and the invasions and overrun of the rest.‚ÄùThis is what was done to us.Padraig Martin, whom I can support wholly, though I‚Äôll never be Southern, nor Christian, nor Dixie Identity- he too has a good word, along these lines.‚ÄúI wonder how many German citizens in 1932 believed there were no political solutions just before they democratically voted for the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP).‚ÄùHow do you find your Kenergy?It was there the whole time.You are Kenough.Another White killed for a lack of in group loyalty? Then only the strong will remain.The War On White People is here, and there¬†is no future¬†unless we stop it.Kenough already!

        Oblique or maybe downright OT, but speaking of Nietzche, here‚Äôs a gem I encountered last night:‚ÄúIt seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to their Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally, and that consequently unbelief in Catholic countries means something quite different from what it does among Protestants‚Äînamely, a sort of revolt against the spirit of the race, while with us it is rather a return to the spirit (or non-spirit) of the race.We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races, even as regards our talents for religion‚Äîwe have POOR talents for it. One may make an exception in the case of the Celts, who have theretofore furnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North: the Christian ideal blossomed forth in France as much as ever the pale sun of the north would allow it.‚ÄùRead Genealogy of Morals 10 years ago, thought it was brilliant. Decided to read more just about a week ago. Kind of embarrassed, almost like I‚Äôve been plagiarizing the guy. Very humbling. He must cast a long shadow. Maybe they should‚Äôve been teaching freshmen Nietzsche instead of Plato when I was in school.

                Fair enough. Point being, I think Nietzsche has more real-world relevance today. Heard more about him from high school lefties than I ever did in college.
In hindsight, Latin would‚Äôve been good, too, but I was there for the STEM in the beginning lol.

            In Nietzsche there‚Äôs so much literary, religious, and philosophical allusion‚Äîand fleeting reference that presumes familiarity not just with writers, races, ancient cities, etc., but with their reputations circa 1880‚Äîhe can‚Äôt really be taught to anyone anymore.

                Once I got into art, they threw all the crazy shit at us, and more. Figured it was mental gymnastics, or something. Never thought for a moment I was supposed to study it seriously!
My copy of Nietzsche is the Modern Library Basic Writings, edited by Kaufmann. Good footnotes for the obscure stuff, would make good fodder for a freshman class.

                Yes, the sweep of Nietzsche‚Äôs allusions is daunting.In some ways it is analagous to the Cantos of Ezra Pound which also weave together a melange of historical, cultural, artistic, and philosophical elements, but in his case not confined to Western culture. Pound also devoted some little time to understanding the web of references to archetypal events, and cultural, religious, and philosophical concerns of the Chinese world which were expected to be at the fingertips of any serious gentleman scholar. This was the method of Confucius, to whom such signposts were not only invocative crystallizations of his peoples‚Äô high culture, but also vital to its transmission down through time.Das Glasperlenspiel, the Glass Bead Game, of Hermann Hesse posits something similar. A quote from notes to a translation of this work‚Ä¶‚ÄúSomething like chess but far more intricate, the game of Magister Ludi [Master of the Game] known as the Glass Bead Game is thought in its purest form, a synthesis through which philosophy, art, music and scientific law are appreciated simultaneously.‚Äù

            German unbelief led to ‚Äúa return to the spirit (or non-spirit) of the race.‚Äù The Germans decided to kill themselves off, and they‚Äôll soon be there. I guess that‚Äôs non-spirit. Or spirit, of a sort. But Nietzsche couldn‚Äôt foresee the ADL or the World Zionist Congress.

                I gather the thing with Germans is that they want the church, the great civilization, the Pax Romana, etc., but something in the spirit revolts at it.Quigley has a great treatment of it, imo, in Tragedy and Hope. He thinks the loss of tribal life is a wound they‚Äôve never recovered from. Hence the appeal of the Roman Imperium and National Socialism‚Äî something not just bigger than oneself, but great, grand, even transcendent‚Äî yet concrete, if Nietzsche is right about the lack of religious talent.Imo, the problem is borrowing from or mimicking Classical Antiquity and the Orient, instead of developing something for oneself, from within oneself.Something throughout history about the Germans (and Germanic people generally), though, that they have to be co-opted or kept down, if you ask me. Also, that they go along with it!

        Interesting that you‚Äôd make assumptions about your reader‚Äôs overall aptitude and abstract thinking capabilities with this post. Not unexpectedly, the responses seem to follow a standard distribution of an IQ bell curve. I am LOLing a bit that this post fulfilled a secondary function as an IQ test.Your reader‚Äôs are, unsurprisingly, mostly high tier midwits with a smattering of smart fractions and a few dim bulbs, so as I said, bog standard bell curve distribution.I think if you want to make your next Standard Intelligence Test a bit easier on the majority readership, don‚Äôt use a lightning rod like Elon Musk. It seemed to be the thing that threw the most people off as your average human is a literalist of not an outright NPC. The ability for higher order abstract reasoning and critical thinking are a vanishingly small percentage of people the days as IQs have dropped precipitously over the last few decades.Pro-Tip for Midwits- this post is not about Elon Musk.

            All the world is a cult! üòÇüëçThis intellectual poseur is of the cult of Vox Day ‚Äì whose leader appeals to cellar dwelling teens and men that read comic books into their 30s and 40s.I still laugh to think about it: back when I still read Vox, sometimes his writing was so bad, nobody understood the point he was trying to make. If somebody dared to ask the fag to make sense, or confronted him with evidence that he was blatantly and obviously wrong, he got angry and told his befuddled readers that they were too stupid to understand what he was driving at! üòÇüëçThis piece is nowhere near the level of nonsense that often tumbled out of Voxxie‚Äôs arse‚Ä¶but it could have been written a little clearer. If the commentariat here is confused‚Ä¶ there is good reason for it. This blog often tends to generate superlative content that rivals that of our esteemed blog host. There is no shortage of intellect here.

        I think that Musk is trying to chase the soyboys, liberal scolds, media hacks, censorship goons, CIA assets, etc. off Twitter. For example, Oliver Darcy (the clearest and best/worst example of all those things) last posted the day that he changed the name to X. Like most media hacks, he was married to Twitter for years, but hasn‚Äôt posted in over a week. This is progress for the platform.It‚Äôs worth noting the entire social media operation has been fake from day one. Twitter was widely acknowledged as the most poorly run social media platform, with horrible backend technology, and yet somehow continued to exist and ‚Äúmake money‚Äù for years. People only started freaking out and asking questions when it changed leadership. Musk showed that this site could function on a fraction of the staff it had, but it was still victim to a coordinated effort by the ADL. In general, though, after two decades, the entire social media system runs on advertising, which doesn‚Äôt make sense considering rates have cratered and study after study shows that the juice isn‚Äôt worth the squeeze. Yet somehow Google (90%+ of its revenue) and Meta (also 90%+) continue to show growth every quarter. Something doesn‚Äôt add up. It‚Äôs almost like there is some hidden hand behind the scenes keeping these companies well-capitalized‚Ä¶Anyway, Musk‚Äôs goal is to make the site not reliant on advertising, and thus the whims of giant corporations, activist groups like the ADL, and perhaps those unseen forces as well. Will it work? I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs a big ask and not without its risks.

            I think Musk‚Äôs move here is a part of this strategy. By suing he is invoking a right to legal discovery of the funding sources for this targeted organization, as well as others of that ilk. It should be interesting to see what is under those rocks, eh?

            Somewhat off topic but I must admit that I don‚Äôt understand how post-BLM advertising can actually work. The majority of the country is still White and there are vast areas that are still 90+% White. Yet, the ads make a point of showing nothing but non-Whites and deliberately offending normal Whites with miscegenation narratives. It‚Äôs so offputting that I refuse to pay any attention even to what the product is supposed to be. I may be more race conscious than most Whites but I know for a fact that this change pisses the normies off too. How do you sell anything by offending the majority of your customers?It‚Äôs like these websites that ‚Äúare funded by ads‚Äù are answering the questions about their own business model by referring us to something (post-BLM woke advertising) that has a huge question mark about how it could actually be valuable itself.

                Advertising is no longer about selling product. It is about advancing the Power Structure‚Äôs anti-white agenda. I mean, really. You‚Äôre going to punish these people by boycotting them? Instead of buying Nikes you buy Addidas. So what? Once you look into Addidas you‚Äôll find out they are every bit as anti-white as Nike. It‚Äôs a frying pan/fire scenario. When the corporations are ideological indistinguishable, boycotts accomplish absolutely nothing. Every corporation still has the same number of customers; they‚Äôre just different customers.

        I want to second the thoughts of commenter Eric Show (is that name a reference to the old Padres pitcher who gave up Pete Rose‚Äôs record-breaking 4,192nd base hit?). My personal goal for the extravaganza of lunacy known as the 2024 U.S. presidential election will be to know as little about it as possible. I consider the whole thing to be a monstrous threat to my IQ and my dignity. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll be able to escape finding out who the presidential candidates of each party turn out to be, but it would be great if I could avoid learning who the VP candidates ultimately are (fat chance I‚Äôll be able to pull that off either). American politics and culture have devolved into a tragicomic carnival farce. The incessant circus of it all should be taken seriously by no one and does not even merit the attention of anybody with a shred of rationality left.

            Yes, and I picked Show‚Äôs name for a reason, based upon what he said about Rose‚Äôs hit (and history) to reporters after the game.

                The great irony is that, in the decades that followed Rose‚Äôs feat, the masters of the baseball stats discovered that 2 of Ty Cobb‚Äôs (the previous leader‚Äôs) base hits had been counted twice, meaning that Cobb did not collect 4,191 career hits and that his true number of hits was 4,189. Therefore, Rose truly broke the record with his 4,190th hit, which occurred a few days earlier in Chicago against the Cubs. Of course, nobody knew about that little statistical snafu as of 1985 when Rose broke the record.P.S.: Hope Zman doesn‚Äôt mind all this baseball statistical talk in his comment section. It is a bit Steve Sailer-ish, isn‚Äôt it? Sorry.

                    It was a better time. I used to love the game. Show was a member of the John Birch Society. I was a kid so I didn‚Äôt understand why he acted like that after the hit. But I learned later when I hung around with a few pro baseball players in a minor league town. I thought the players on my college team were caveman. But nothing like pro baseball players.
Show was too intelligent to be hanging around baseball clubhouses; it took the life out of him.

            After last election (which I followed from Europe where I live) I told someone: ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs such blatant fraud in the vote count, then this is a historical turning point for the U. S.‚Äù.
I still think that was a historical turning point‚Ä¶ that they could overrule the real ballots like they did, without even much effort, struggle, or trouble.Much that could be thoughtx or hoped to make sense before, cannot since those events took place.

I simply don‚Äôt believe that the images and words blasted in our faces from screens and boxes relate to reality in any meaningful way any longer. It‚Äôs fictional.

            Same.  Up until about two years ago I was a very political person: firmly planted on the right wing of the mainstream, always out there trying to persuade people and be an ‚Äúengaged citizen‚Äù as it were.   Thought I might eventually even leave my whitecollar career to run for office or write something.  Having never served in the military, I saw politics as a different way to maybe someday serve.That‚Äôs all gone now.  My worldview died in 2020 (everything about that year‚Ä¶the orchestrated riots, the smashed statues, the rigged election, the consequence-free market manipulation, the inducement of medical paranoia, and finally the TV circus at the Capitol).The mainstream game is locked up: top to bottom, by hollow and greedy people ‚Äúwhose only God is their own belly‚Äù as the good book puts it.   The United States of America as our grandfathers understood it no longer exists even  in principle.  Ordinary decent people (whatever their numbers) cannot fix it by political action, I don‚Äôt think.  I no longer see why anybody except a hollow careerist or mindless follower would want to be involved with any of this.That‚Äôs not to suggest any weird or illegal alternative, only to state that those of us with a measure of ambition and competence will direct our efforts elsewhere now.

                    Yes, the culture is even more broken than the political scene if that‚Äôs possible.  I was never a ‚Äúsports fan‚Äù in the sense of feeling invested but I did enjoy well-executed play and would stay somewhat current.  Sports was also valuable common currency for talking with men of different backgrounds and having something in common.  But two major sports are so culturally repulsive now it‚Äôs an offense to even try to care.  I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm going to take an interest in tattooed and dreadlocked illiterate criminals while their corporate paymasters lecture me on ‚Äúantiracist‚Äù morality.  Baseball and hockey are still watchable but, not being sufficiently Vibrant, they‚Äôve gone gay to compensate.  That‚Äôs even worse.

        I‚Äôm not embarrassed to admit I have no clue what this essay is about.  From what I can tell, Musk is certainly the figurehead of a cult, but not the weak/strong as described in this essay.
Musk is the head of the techno-utopian cult of bugmen who believe our stoves, heaters and cars are making Gaia mad. For some unknown reason, if we don‚Äôt all buy 100k Dollar electric vehicles, we‚Äôre all gonna die.  Everything with Musk and others like him has to be silly and complicated and will ‚Äúsave the world‚Äù in some way.

            Yes and no.  Musk is too smart to believe the craziest of the climate stuff.  But yes, he‚Äôs a technology cultist, a globalist and a grifter off the system.  Henry Ford sold a useful replacement to the horse.  Elon Musk sells us something we don‚Äôt need and gets $12,000 per vehicle of taxpayer money to do so.  I respect the hell out of his rocketry work though.

                In my view, his space projects more than make up for all his other silliness. He‚Äôs doing things that NASA is incapable of doing. His total engineering approach sets a great example for all other big, technology-driven projects.
For that, I‚Äôm happy to give him a pass on the other stuff. Also, I have no idea what motivates him, but his motivation seems wildly different from every other super-rich person out there.

                    Musk does well with his space project in that he shows up the government alternative, NASA.  However, Musk continues to spin a tale of space exploration in excess of known technology.  For this I criticize him.He puts the cart before the horse.  His big whopper is a fixation on ‚Äúcolonizing‚Äù Mars.  Problems abound‚Äîand that‚Äôs the known ones.  Propulsion, self sustainable Martian habitats, and more need to be perfected.  Until then, a manned landing will simply be an extraordinary expensive *stunt*.I suspect he knows this‚Äîhe‚Äôs not stupid‚Äîbut it‚Äôs a good grift for the rubes and in the meanwhile allows him to develop his earthly satellite communication network, which is where the money is.

                I‚Äôve tried twice. Twice I just couldn‚Äôt get through it. I don‚Äôt usually read books in a single setting. I‚Äôll usually read like 100 pages a day.  But with Gulliver‚Äôs Travels, I just never get around to picking it back up at some point.   Same thing with Robinson Crusoe. Both had good sections and sections I would describe a a slog.  It‚Äôs not like I can‚Äôt get through books, particularly old books.  My handle name is from a 100 plus year old book.  Most of the fiction I enjoy reading is from authors long dead.

            Musk is representative of the globohomo elite that need to justify their tyranny by making it ‚Äúmoral‚Äù.  Woke is essentially them shifting their egoistic moral philosophy into a religion wherein good conveniently aligns with their desires and evil conveniently aligns with what they do not want.
This happens over and over in history as soon as power concentrates.  Invariably the guys with the power decide they‚Äôre God and order their slaves to build them a giant stone dick so everyone knows they‚Äôre God.

            Coulter is a spent shell casing at this point.

It may just be an trial balloon to find patronage with some new group and a new market for their writing. Perhaps Coulter is angling to become ‚Äúformer arch-conservative Ann Coulter‚Äù and get back on the talk shows in that new persona.

            Interesting to wonder what Musk is really up to, engaging in (by surface appearances) silly and distracting activities relative to his main business interests.He‚Äôs not a conservative, nor even a libertarian standing on free-speech principle.  His worldview seems to be a mashup of techno-futurist, atheist/hedonist and expert in collecting government subsidies.  The man has no fixed political or cultural principles as such.Be aware also that he‚Äôs loaned his private satellite network to the Ukranians, and his need to procure rare minerals and locate facilities gives him access in bad neighborhoods, as well as in China that even our government may not have.Add to that the amount of taxpayer money he gets every year and his need to stay on Uncle Sam‚Äôs good side, and there‚Äôs an almost perfect nexus for cooperation between Musk and the Intel/Security/Surveillance apparatus.  I‚Äôm not smart enough to speculate helpfully beyond that.This phenomenon is *not* new in so-called conservative politics, but the issue of social media regulation is unique in its importance to the Praetorian Guard in Washington.  I do not trust Elon Musk as far as I can throw him.PS  Also the guy has apparently engaged in a lot of stock market shenanigans‚Ä¶pretty much outright manipulation over the years with his media comments and subsequent trading.  The Feds have got that on him too.

                    ‚ÄúBut could any billionaire really be 100% on our side, if you have that much cash, you want the system to continue, from your POV everything is perfect. In theory billionaires live in the same country as you, in practice they live on a different Planet‚ÄùIsnt at least one of his kids a castratti now?  Wasnt he massively and publicly cucked by one of his childrens mothers by the tranny army leak guy?Dont agree that things are perfect for billionaires or anyone else.  I imagine his social circle is worse than the rest of us could possibly stomach.  I would certainly not trade my family for his nor my life for his, not for a trillion dollars.Money solves certain problems and creates others, doesnt exempt anyone from the state of the world we live in

                        yes its true, one of his kids is a tranny, but AFAIK Musk doesn‚Äôt buy into the trans BS. His tranny son hates him,  he might be the billionaire closest to us, but I don‚Äôt think any billionaire would go all in on the dissident right, (or what ever you want to call it)

                My reading of Musk is that he‚Äôs almost certainly a closet race realist who occasionally flirts with the truth on that stuff but is mainly about positioning himself to take advantage of the current culture in all the ways people here have pointed out. He may be somewhat analogous to those prominent landowners and generals in the twilight of Rome who eventually went rogue and rebelled, carving off a piece of the old empire.I‚Äôve actually speculated here before that some of the tech oligarchs (not just Musk) might eventually just outright take over places like Silicon Valley that are already essentially city-states. Most of these guys pay lip service to the liberal fruitcakes who run California and other lefty states on things like drugs and open borders but if they had a free hand they would probably all run things more like Singapore. Open borders and hordes of opioid zombies are great to virtue signal with as long as you can send the bill for the chaos to 40 million dumbass tax cattle. Eventually even basic security will fail in these places and the tech overlords will be forced to deal with reality. If the central authority (both the US itself and state governments) becomes weak and ineffective enough you could end up with the Fiefdom of Facebook or the Apple Autonomous Zone.Note that I‚Äôm not saying this is desirable. Singapore is NO FUN for anyone and I doubt the new corpo-feudal states would be very tolerant of the dissident Right. This kind of thing could benefit us in the general sense that it would represent power devolving to a more local level and that could be an opening for White micro-states as well.

            I live and work in Chicago proper.  We‚Äôre still gentrifying but it‚Äôs interesting.  Businesses are not re-establishing physical presence downtown post covid hysteria.  There is massive empty commercial space there.  But they‚Äôre bringing in the monied young from all over the world to live in art deco and new construction highrises, the former had served as office spaces.  Gentrification is occuring largely to meet code for multi-tennant dwellings.  The shrewd here are attempting torent space to foreigners and illegal aliens. I have an acquaintence who was a banker turned lawyer turned real estate agent.  He just showed me a gentrified, cough, house that looks really nice.  Inside are living no fewer than forty individuals, all illegals, in a pricey neighborhood.  My understanding is that somebof them ‚Äúhotbunk‚Äù and it looked that way.  All I saw appeared to be male.  That is all.

        It is absolutely incredible to me that Musk has avoided fraud charges for all these years.  AFAIK, his ‚Äúfull self driving‚Äù cost 15 thousand Dollars, yet requires the driver keep their full attention on the road and both hands on the wheel and that this ‚Äúfull self driving‚Äù can do the worst thing at the worst possible time. Despite the many accidents this has caused, there is still no recall on it.  Other cars get mandatory recalls for far less.  Where the hell is NHTSA?  Where the hell are the feds?

            Musk is the first industrialist since Henry Ford who is too big to cancel. FDR and his coterie hated Ford, but they were dependent on his production both during the Depression and even more so during the war. Musk basically has a monopoly on space launches, Starlink is crucial for the military, and Tesla more or less supports the green agenda.Musk is weird, and has some heterodox views, but he‚Äôs not really ‚Äúour guy‚Äù. He does look to the future rather than the past, unlike so many of us, but I‚Äôm not sure I completely like the future he envisions.

            Forget about Tesla‚Äôs faulty ‚Äúself driving‚Äù, I‚Äôm still at ‚Äúrestraint of trade‚Äù discussion. Tesla is at the forefront of the current brouhaha wrt ‚Äúwho owns the car‚Äù.  Tesla does not allow repair in non-Tesla service centers and if such is done, Tesla will discover it, and severely limit their/your car‚Äôs abilities‚Äîsuch as fast charging.
At this point, as I see it, no one owns a Tesla.  They simply pay a price for the right to drive it at Tesla‚Äôs discretion.  I also note, the other car companies are catching onto this as well, so Tesla is not unique.

                Yes, it‚Äôs gotten utterly ridiculous.  BMW wants you to pay them a monthly fee to use your heated seats you paid for and are in the car.  Toyota wants you to pay for the ability to remotely start the car.  (I knew people in the 80s with remote car starting. It‚Äôs not some newfangled internet only thing.)  Ford wants to take the worst aspect of Android and fuse it with the worst aspects of screens in cars and make it a rolling billboard.  They filed a patent for the ability to play a commercial for a store you may be approaching. I think they used McDonald‚Äôs on toll roads as an example.As much as I like tech, I oppose virtually all tech like this in cars.  Cars are now as big a spy machine as your phone. It records EVERYTHING. It may very well be sending all that data home to GM/Ford whatever.  They are loaded now with OTA upgradability.  Combine this with ‚Äúfull self driving‚Äù and it‚Äôs possible (I don‚Äôt care if they say it is not) we‚Äôll wake one fine Sept 11th morning and find all GM model X from 2028-2032 are deliberate ramming other cars, buildings and people.  And for what?  The risk/reward ratio is heavily risk and almost no reward.

                    Remember, whatever your car knows, the Fed‚Äôs do too.  I bought a Ford truck about 4 years ago.  I can remote start it from anywhere!  So I guess the vehicle must be connected via satellite.  I can check on the truck via an app on my phone or IPad over the internet.  And if stolen, simply track its location.  I assume any LEO is familiar with the setup and can track it as well with the VIN.  The VIN of course is in a nationwide database.Why do I have this, because it came with the car and there was no up charge or monthly payments, but more importantly‚ÄîI was dumb as a box of rocks.  My previous vehicle was ancient and I‚Äôd never even heard of these new ‚Äúdevelopments‚Äù in technology.  üôÅ

        I doubt that I am truly alone in having no idea what the hell this essay is saying, but I might be alone in confessing it.If this is supposed to be some kind of inside joke, I guess I lack the background for ‚Äúgetting it.‚Äù If it is just another excuse for Z-Man to act snarky about religion, than I can only say that he is coming to resemble Steve Sailer in being resoundingly obtuse about about certain subjects and deaf to all the admonitions coming from his audience to the effect that he needs to wise up or shut up, because he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about.Is this just something that happens to men as they approach the age of 60?

                There is no such thing as ‚ÄúSemitic‚Äù monotheism or ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù neural hardware. And there is no such thing as neural hardware.In an ordinary world, nobody would be faced with the task of needing to refute such ridiculousness, but we have a dissident political commentariat here drenched in nothing but scientism and smarm, so here we are.Anybody who unironically uses a phrase like ‚ÄúAryan neural hardware‚Äù is burdened by a worldview too truncated, distorted, and false to ever function as a source of inspiration for future cultural restoration. I don‚Äôt suppose you understand how absurd this sounds. You chafe at something that has depth, transcendence, unsurpassed wisdom, and life eternal‚Äîand subject yourself to a syllabus  of serum fractions.This is perhaps the most damning criticism of the HBDers. Not thehighestcriticism, but damning just because it is so comical. You repose your hopes in a test tube, a vial of DNA from which you‚Äôve teased out a minute statistical difference between two populations, and built it into a creed. What do you hope to accomplish there with your chemistry set, a nucleotide here, an antibody there, collecting boogers, sniffing everyone‚Äôs underwear? Is that what you call a world?What grounds have you to criticizereligion?Why, the meanest heathenism has more of the sublime in it than your natural philosophy. The worshippers of goats and gynecology at least know how to seek the living; they sacrifice life for life. You subject saliva to centrifuges and call it wisdom.Those who use the word ‚Äúreligion‚Äù as a pejorative truly are hoist with their own petard. They don‚Äôt know what religion is, but they know whatthey think it is, and they fail to recognize that the are enthralled to a cruder, shallower, more preposterous version of it than any of the ‚Äúreligions‚Äù they criticize.

                    I agree with your central sentiment and its well stated‚Ä¶ but its also confusing here as a reply to anything as its not at all clear that Z was criticizing religion in his post.  Its not at all clear that any two people understood his post at all or in a consistent way.  Replies are likewise confuses and spinning off in every different directionPersonally I find this sort of extended analogy tiresome even when its good and pretty much just called TLDR like a good zoomer would.Anyway just doesnt seem like the place to plant the flag and fight to the death with people who are generally, fellow travelers.

            The reason for this essay‚Äôs strangeness and obscurity lies in the fact that it ill accords with the context of his previous writings. Yes, there is mention of the religious (in Z‚Äôs conception) elite (the Leftist managerial class), the Dirt People, and the former‚Äôs bizarre persecution of the latter, ostensibly justified by the grave threat presented by the powerless. However, techno-futurism has never been a major bugaboo with Z, nor has Elon Musk. He inexplicably imputes libertarianism in the elite class, then correctly‚Äìif obliquely‚Äìseems to acknowledge its postmodern elements, which is something he has never done before. His invocation of the ‚Äúmaster race‚Äù is a weird bolt from the blue that smacks of Leftism and its paranoia. Then he speaks of a schism in the ruling class‚Äìyet another new trope‚Äìand concludes with that class presumably saving itself under the rule of a descendant of Musk. In the past, Z has never spoken of the recrudescence of the managerial class, only of its demise.All in all, this essay feels as though it was written by somebody besides Z, and that is why it has set the cat among the commentating pigeons. It almost totally confounds our expectations.

                I admit today‚Äôs missive is challenging and ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, but I found it an interesting thought experiment perhaps designed to challenge one‚Äôs concept of religion and its assumed purpose/intent.  Nothing is threatening to any ‚Äúbeliever‚Äù in my opinion.When I was a student, I had a professor who did just such a thing in class during a lecture period.  He proposed a different world/society in which nudity and sex were totally acceptable and publicly commonplace among all, but in which *eating* had strict regulation and social taboos.Got a lot of laughs initially, but soon students were imagining how sexual taboos and prohibitions could/would be applied to a basic human process called ‚Äúfood consumption‚Äù.  And perhaps re-evaluating another basic human process‚Äîsexuality, and why such taboos came about.

        The ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù response that ruffled so many progressives did so because it violated the progressive orthodoxy not because the religion is rooted in evil.The musk religion is similarly designed. Most adherents make the fatal assumption that when their priests talk of eternal utopian transhuman progress that they are included in this design. Cue shock when the rockets to mars full of heads in jars leave them behind in the ghetto.Like ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù. Their comfortable submission to the techno-prog death cult is a function of price/value in their transactional interface with the borg. Which means most will suffer the same fate they visit upon the lower castes.Ironically, the equalizing effect of the top-down imperial ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù restrictions undid decades of predictable, albeit declining, economic mechanisms to which the beautiful ones and the coattail strivers had hailed as their morally righteous reward for previous compliance.The price fixing, rigging, and bait n switch that had these previously anointed betters solidly in the cloud disrupted the progressive price discovery and thus the corresponding social strata.When their private school tuition failed to keep their designer kid in school and unmasked, they became unclean just the same as us nonbelievers.The cynic that I am has me believing that the religion of Elon is to bring those dispossessed back into the fold. That their ‚Äúred pulled‚Äù experience was one of price hyperinflation and not a reckoning of spiritual, ethical, or moral foundation means this effort will be largely successful.And I‚Äôm fine with that. Let the piper call the serpents home. I don‚Äôt want such weak males in my camp. May Tesla have mercy on their e-souls.

If the rich really find a way to immortality, their society will probably turn out like in Zardoz. Power to hedonism to boredom to a wish for death they aren‚Äôt allowed to have.

            My reading of Z‚Äôs somewhat esoteric essay today is that it‚Äôs just a commentary on how what we‚Äôve called ‚Äúleftism‚Äù is evolving into a weird sort of multi-tiered supremacist ideology. The central joke of the whole thing is that your place in the (very unequal) hierarchy will depend on your acceptance of liberal equalitarian principles. Those at the bottom are the ones who accept the reality of human inequalities the most. The ones at the top will be the people who will most reflexively tell you, as one job recruiter did to me, that the only differences among employees are due to ‚Äútraining‚Äù. They will of course believe that their highly developed sense of egalitarianism is what justifies their privileged place in the system. As others have pointed out Musk is just a diversion and figurehead in the story.The problem with making this kind of society/cult work though is really the same as that of Soviet Communism. You get a steep sided social pyramid where about half the work of each layer in the ziggurat is watching the layer immediately below for heresy and sedition. The results for the actual Soviets were chronic low productivity and morale. I‚Äôm sure the current GAE ruling class thinks that this won‚Äôt matter because after all, no one does much productive work anyway and useful things all arrive magically from China. Perhaps Covid was just a way of testing the idea of keeping the Karens busy watching each other and the Dirt People for those that can‚Äôt be given jobs in HR.

        Wouldn‚Äôt be the first time humans have tried to deify a human to create a new religion. Caesar, Popes, Saints, Mao, Hitler, Obama for example, but all short lived and just a limited appeal.
What is missing is a touch of the mysterious, transcendence, hope. Obama‚Äôs message of hope and change failed because it was sublunar and all to human. An X factor, something from the X files,  like big bright flashing neon X, hovering over us from the heavens. Something we can pray to.

            Bubblenomics.  All the money going around means every crackpot idea ever proposed gets fully funded. With the media full of morons and grifters and compliant young women, every crackpot idea gets lots of inch-columns of gush and praise.
Practical things are swept aside and everything has to have some kind of hi-tech angle.  Why fix potholes when you can have underground pods carrying your car at breakneck speeds underground and out of sight in the new Martian cities.

                Shame we ain‚Äôt got no hydrogen.  I remember back in the day, like the late 90s, everyone and their mother was talking about the upcoming inevitable ‚Äúhydrogen economy‚Äù  I was always like, what hydrogen? We don‚Äôt have any!  Despite hydrogen being the most abundant element in the universe, we simply are not blessed with any free hydrogen.  You can make it, but always at a net energy loss.But assuming we did have viable hydrogen sources, hydrogen is really not very good for an ICE or really even a fuel cell. Because it is so small, it is difficult to store.  It is volumetrically inefficient even when stored at very high pressure. And they leak. If there is one thing you don‚Äôt want in your garage, it‚Äôs a bunch of hydrogen hanging out in the ceiling.The Japanese claim they have something called ‚Äúred hydrogen,‚Äù which is hydrogen made directly from nuclear power, heat or steam I believe.  But this still doesn‚Äôt solve other problems.

                    Hydrogen is not freely found because it is so damn small.  It simply bleeds away into space, so we‚Äôve got to make it.  If the (spare) power is found to produce hydrogen, then probably hydrogen has a role as a fuel.

                        Probably not in a car, at least not an ICE car (an ICE can run on hydrogen).  Even the hydrogen fuel cell cars have terrible range.  Though it may change in the future, hydrogen is only available in a few places around the country, I believe most in California. The equivalent price (enough to drive X miles) is really high too.Really, hydrogen, even if it became our main fuel would not be especially relevant to energy because it‚Äôs not a source of energy if you have to make it.As I understand it, hydrogen fuel cells have some success powering equipment like forklifts and side-loaders used indoors.  That is a near perfect use case.

                        ‚Äú Really, hydrogen, even if it became our main fuel would not be especially relevant to energy because it‚Äôs not a source of energy if you have to make it.‚ÄùTars, that‚Äôs short sighted and not really applicable.  Hydrogen, or any fuel, can take more energy input than it produces as energy output and still be useful.  Depends on the application.  If one needs to have a source of fuel to replace gas in a car and nothing else is available (as in zero emissions).Now I don‚Äôt think we are going there, but it‚Äôs not without precedent.  I know a guy who works in MI in their State utility company.  They, like everywhere else, is mandated to go ‚Äúgreen‚Äù.  They have their windmills, they have their solar arrays, and they even have Lake Michigan hydro facilities.  However, they don‚Äôt get enough power generation during the night or when the wind dies down.So during the day, they use ‚Äúspare‚Äù electricity to pump water from Lake Michigan 300‚Äô up to a holding lake to drive generators during night and at peak load times.  This is obviously a costly way to generate electricity, but in essence the cost is free as it‚Äôs a storage of surplus energy.

                As Compsci said below, hydrogen is the smallest and lightest of the elements, which makes H2 the Houdini of molecules.
That means you need radically improved seals and valves throughout your system compared to one that handles compressed air.
Industrial scale hydrogen is also hugely energy intensive. Some of the, ‚Äúchemically improved,‚Äù methods require methane inputs and produce carbon dioxide outputs, both of which are huge no-nos in the ruling green death cult‚Äôs liturgy.

                    Just recently Canada and Germany (IIRC, it might be the UK) just signed a deal where Germany agrees to buy hydrogen made in BC with a specialized electrolysis powered by solar farms.  I was watching a video on the agreement and the guy broke it down in energy terms. It‚Äôs horrible.  It‚Äôs so bad it might be a better idea to charge batteries in Canada and then ship the batteries to Germany fully charged so they can be discharged in Germany. But they got dumb green laws they gotta follow.The UK though is generating electricity by burning Canadian forest.  It‚Äôs the biggest wood fired power plant in the world I believe and they get a huge percentage of their fuel from Canada‚Äôs old growth BC forest.  This is a goddamned environmental crime, IMHO.Frankly, I have no idea how this is even possible or if it is even a net-positive in energy.  I would assume lumber has a higher value than wood you are going to burn. Plus you have to ship it thousands of miles from the West coast of Canada to the UK. I don‚Äôt know about wood ships, but container ships use on average 150 tons of bunker fuel a day.

        Old and busted: the meek shall inherit the Earth.‚ÄúNew‚Äù and improved: the strong shall crush the weak.Westerners and actually almost all modern people perceive religion as a universal moral code that promotes the good and fights evil. This hardly always has been the case, and arguably the current and dying arrangement is a dramatic outlier. Primitive religion highest rituals often were inflicting pain and suffering and engaging in subjugation. The Aztecs are frequently cited as an example of malevolent faith, but surely the Hebraic god also has to be seen as retaining some of those features.We are re-primitizing in the ways that are most profound and impactful. If anyone thought feudalism would be the worst-case scenario, they need to reassess.

            Meek as intended in that quote has been misinterpreted.  It does not mean weak. It means ‚Äúpower under control ‚Äú. Christ is the ultimate example of meekness because He had absolute power but did not stray from His mission and kept that power under control (dying for us rather than annihilating us).  Unfortunately too many modern Christians have forgotten that.Not to equate him with our Lord and Savior in any way, but Putin of all people seems to understand this somewhat. His approach in the SMO has been to maintain control of Russian power and not just unleash massive destruction willy nilly as Western powers are want to do. Go figure.

Yep, just look at WWII and our strategic bombings of Germany and Japan.  White papers release after WWII basically indicated a failure to shorten the war appreciably, albeit I acknowledge the call to use atom bombs to close off WWII in Japan as a coin toss. Mostly however, they were pure vengeance against the populace of the belligerents.

            Come to think of it, techno-primitivism is not a bad moniker for the elite culture of the West. As you point out, it is atavistic, it worships the most primitive people (negroes) and their rites (rap, twerking, chicken and waffles), but by the same token it promotes a glorious techno-futurism that will produce an environmental utopia.

        One aspect of every religion seems to be the responsibility to uplift the weak and protect the vulnerable in a community. It seems to be a necessary component to create enough trust in a society to be able to function, but it depends on the religion how much care, if any, goes to outsiders. Another aspect is the criteria to allow outsiders into the religion. Religions built around ancestor worship essentially require marriage while more universalist religions have a set of rituals to designate new devotees.Because Musk‚Äôs hypothetical religion above fails to properly protect the weak in one‚Äôs own tribe, nor have converts with real ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù, it‚Äôs bound to collapse into warring factions.Note that the left has basically the same issues, only in their mind the strong are oppressors, full stop, and in order to be good one must either make oneself weak, or pretend to be weak. The bar of entry into the left‚Äôs religion can range from only requiring posting nonsense on social media with no real commitment to time and resources, to bowing and scraping your feet to black people, to castrating your kids. The only thing keeping the coalition together is their abstract hatred of outsiders keeping the coalition going. That and the most insane propaganda apparatus the world has ever seen.

            The Left sees the strong as weak. It is a ‚Äúthe first shall be the last‚Äù sort of thing.

                And ‚Äúweak‚Äù is what they perceive to be the victim. Which is why the churches all promote immigration and sexuality now. They actually think the Sanchezes and gay people are the proverbial cripples at Bethesda. And right-wingers are the Pharisees.
