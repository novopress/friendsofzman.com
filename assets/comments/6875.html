        When I was a young man roaming around Southeast Asia was a big thing. I even hooked up with an outfit that paid for my trip, fed and clothed me, and gave me a monthly stipend. It wasn‚Äôt much fun though.

        ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs adventure and then there is wearing a meat suit into the lion‚Äôs den.‚ÄùLaughing over that‚Ä¶good one!Still, I do feel sympathy for the kid. The punishment is completely out of proportion to the crime, yet someone traveling with this young man should have made it clear that there are certain countries (btw, who in their right mind wants to visit North Korea???) where you absolutely have to be on your best behavior, no exceptions. I could be way off base, but it seems less likely that this was an entitlement thing and more likely that he didn‚Äôt have an understanding that there are countries where people can lose a hand over stealing, or lock you up and make you do hard labor for 15 years. Many young people today seem to want to believe that everyone in the world is more or less the same, just different races, religions, cultures, living in exotic locales.

                Yeah, the State Dept. Alerts and Warnings for Nork covers in about a jillion words what happened to him. Better would have been a look at one of the DOD unclassified Foreign Clearance Guides, but he probably isn‚Äôt smart enough to know how to find  one.

            Did you read the story some time back about a little Taiwanese boy who tripped at a museum and damaged a 350-year-old painting valued at $1.5 million? Thank goodness that didn‚Äôt happen in a North Korean museum or Taiwan would probably be a radioactive hole in the ocean.

        I remember some years back an American kid got caned for spitting on the sidewalk in Singapore or someplace. It actually made it to the evening news and I think even some elected officials even tried to intervene. Germans were looking at each other in total fascination‚Ä¶our position was simple, take the beating you deserve and get on with it. Once again, the Americans made a dog and pony show over nothing. Cultural differences are just amazing.

        Given what giant propagandists the Norks are known to be, why did he not simply ask if they would give him a poster to display in his dorm room, to show the West how thing ‚Äúreally are‚Äù in the kingdom of Fatty Whitewalls‚Ñ¢ The Third?
It takes a special kind of stupid to get thrown in prison for trying to spread the regime‚Äôs propaganda.

            ‚Äúlooking for a way to stay fit‚Äù pretty much answer your question.
Though your query reminded me of this:‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîChesty Puller said before he diedThere was five things that he wanted to ride
Tricycle, bicycle, auto-mobileA four legged pony on a ferris wheel‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Mind you I never served.  USMC was a pretty poor option for a reasonably smart person getting out of high school in the late 70s.   Nevertheless I appreciate the Joadies.

        All the little idiot had to do was buy a poster.  If that wasn‚Äôt allowed, take a picture of one and have a poster made.  But no, Duncelot had to break a couple of laws and end up in a norko prison.  At least he will come out smarter than he went in‚Ä¶.
