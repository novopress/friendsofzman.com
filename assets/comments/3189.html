        Medical doctors are incapable of doing scientific research: bad designs, stunningly wrong stats, confusion of cause and effect and general all around stupidity.

        So maybe liberalism/progressivism is a virus?  Could explain why it is so easily transmitted in city environs and not so much in rural settings.  Hmmmmm

        I like how 40 of 90 tested positive for stupidism. At first blush is seems like a blow to the IQ uber alles guys because we have a pretty solid example of environmental factors altering IQ.
Not quite that solid. The presence of the virus hardly means it’scausingthe infected subjects’ low IQs. Interesting first step, but without meaning, at this time.

No doubt. I was having too much fun with it to make any serious points. A sample size of 90 is also another give away. I’m not dismissive of the roles of pathogens, but I’m not optimistic anything will ever come of it.

        This stuff is why I’ve been reading this blog, though I come from the wrong tribe and disagree with a good three quarters of what is in the posts, let alone the comments.But yes, once you account for the “trillions of bacteria, viruses. and fungi” there is little less.  A huge portion if not most of human behavior can be accounted for the mix of these micro-organisms at any one time, and you can change anyones behaviour if you can knowingly alter the mix.  This is probably true for all complex animals, but only humans claim to have consciousness and to be able to control our destiny.Genes are important -and also can be altered- but probably to a lesser extent.How this pertains to everyone’s obsession with race, pretty much all the red tribe thinking and much of the blue tribe thinking is informed with Calvinism, the idea that people’s characters are handed down from God and can never be changed.  This itself was a reimportation into the Christian context of what had been the pagan view.  But its completely unscientific.  You can completely change people -if you knew how to do it and had some idea of what you wanted to change them into.
