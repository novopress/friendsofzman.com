        The realization that the West is no better than the people I grew up pointing fingers at has been extremely disheartening, to say the least. At the end of the day, all governments resort to the same tactics to maintain their grasp on power and I feel like a real sucker for having bought into the “we’re better than that” propaganda.

            Ditto for me. I bought the baseball and apple pie flavored patriot slop. There certainly were heroes and good men in our past, but the government has been rotten since before the ink was dry on the Constitution.

                Better baseball than football. Better yet, hockey. It’s all still slop, but if I’m in the mood to veg out and enjoy watching world-class athletes tickle my nostalgia for a better time on a lazy afternoon, hockey and baseball (Rugby, when I can find a game) are about all I or any decent person can stomach.

                Apparently the Council of the Sanhedrin agreed that the DEMs should win in Wisconsin.
This time they authorized a reverse-Zuckerberg, and instead of flooding the ballot boxes with fake ballots, they strategically forgot to print the ballots for the GOP precincts.
https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4308282/posts
The tl;dr is thatthe Council of the Sanhedrin decided to have a Trump Presidency with a DEM senate.
I guess the Council figures they can playoffthe two parties [GOP &amp; DEM] against one another.

            I still have faith in the West, and the core people.  The quality of the leadership and populace has worsened – a result of wealth, ease, and arrogance.  I do see bright spots in Gen Z, surprisingly.  Some have more of a realistic streak – they’re not as naive as their elders.  Their lives will be harder, creating a tougher breed of people better able to rise to the challenges the West currently faces.  I’d bet on the West and our people in the long run, over any other group of people on the planet.

                I agree, but would add that aggressive subversion was also a major factor in the decline of the leadership and culture.  Rotten apples falling into our yard, as was once said.

                    True – the aggressive subversion is one of the challenges that we need a tougher breed of people to deal with.  The lot that we’ve had for the past 60 years or so have been unable to rise to that challenge.

                I agree. But it could take two centuries or more before the West is rebuilt. There will come a Biblical deluge, a genuine dark age, and a long, painful recovery.

                    Agreed.  No gain without pain… and there’s a lot of pain in our future.  I’m pretty optimistic a smaller, better, higher quality group will emerge on the other side though

Our boys at Moderna suspected that the female descendants of the V@xxinated would  start displaying recessive traits for ovarian failure within a couple of generations.

I’m sure that the same thing will happen to the testes of the male descendants.
But for the Depopulationists, it’s of utmost importance [first &amp; foremost] to destroy the ovaries.
The destruction of the testes can wait.

                    Men are bailing from their feminist nations. Ain’t going back to the plantation, either.
And DAMN sure they are not going to marry under the supervision of the Sisterhood and their (anti)family courts.
Get machines to make babies with the predatory, feral females of the West.  Good luck with that.  Even the machines may refuse.  :O)

                        I feel some significant sympathy for divorced dads and I understand their bitterness.  Nonetheless this does not make them great people to give relationship advice and “some girls are really mean so lets all just opt out and leave the continuation of our species to the hottentots” is a TERRIBLE idea.

                            You speak from ignorance, believing that the evil poured out on men and boys the past 60 somehow must be due to bitter ‘divorced dads’ and shiftless deadbeat men who refuse to pay your princesses their blood money, aka child support.I am not divorced.  I have never been married.  No kids.  No legal judgments against me and no legal encumbrances.So, you’re basically talking shit, there, Hillary.  But then, you’ve never been into facts, nor the truth.You post anonymously and make false allegations against men here.  Go crawl back into your serpent hole where you and your kind belong.

                                Youre right, it’s pretty nefarious of me to post anonymously here on this website where everyone else is wisely posting their racist antisemitism next to their photo ID and home address.You seem to have some kind of Supreme Gentleman like need to associate criticism with a cabal of mysterious women who have both completelt avoided and yet also wronged you.  Can’t relate as I do have more than a couple women in my family that I don’t hate and don’t hate me.  This is how it goes down in our slimy serpent hole I guess.  That being the serpent hole where human beings form voluntary but stable relationships and have children?  Horrific stuff!Sorry will try harder to become bitterly celibate in order to bravely dead end the family tree my entire ancestry worked and sacrificed to propagate and cultivate.  I will have to try hard because I am actually pretty damn sexy though.

Both the correlation between men who had sex with men and their sexual attraction and also the correlation between sexual attraction and self-identification were high.”

        Europe has already proven the cartridge box works. Muslim neighborhoods don’t abide by European laws. When European police attempt to impose European laws, the Muslims either riot or ignore them.
Anyone remember when magazines talked about their right to show images of Muhammad until some guys w/ guns shot up that magazine office. After that, the great and the good just dropped the matter.

                Yeah, it’s over for France. Around 25% of births (maybe a touch more) are Muslim. Another 5-7% are African. Between immigration and different birth rates, those numbers will be 30-35% and close to 10% in a decade.
And they will be concentrated in the cities and a few regions. Good luck with that.

            The no go zones exist because the governments allow them to. If white Europeans set up their own no go zones they would be completely crushed within one hour. Remember when BLM protestors established the Capital Hill Autonomous Zone in Seattle and occupied several city blocks for nearly a month. The Police just sat back and let them run wild. The mistake that the occupiers made was protesting outside the White female mayor’s house who up until that time had been kissing their ***. Next thing you know hundreds of cops in riot gear show up and quickly clear the place out. Also, I recall Biden threatening MAGA supporters with F-16s and some congressman who I forgot the name of threatened dissident citizens with nuclear weapons.

                You’re thinking like a white guy. Big battles. Organization. Logistics. Tactics. Training. Gear.That’s not how this kind of war is fought. If a mayor in Europe decided he was done with No-Go Zones and sent in the police in full riot gear, of course, the police would win. But one of two things would happen. The Muslims would just pull back, wait for the police to leave and then go back to doing what they were doing.Or the Muslims would just do low-level rioting for weeks on end. Is the mayor going to keep the police in the Muslim section forever. He can’t afford that.Of course, the Muslims could take things a step farther. Maybe a police officer assigned to a Muslim neighborhood gets shot walking home from the grocery store. Maybe the police chief’s car blows up. Maybe the mayor’s kid is attack on the street.Are the Europeans willing to fight that kind of war? No chance.

                        Because they were fighting against another group of  White Christians, even if they were  the hated (to the Irish) Englishmen.  The Irish aren’t fighting like that against the Nigerians and Pakistanis.  And the Irish women are spreading their legs for the invaders.  When I start seeing those whores get taken out, then I’ll believe the Irish have a chance.

        Good essay.Recently my wife and I went to see a carny we liked from our youth, Daryl Hall of Hall and Oates. We had to park a ways from the venue and walk through a  park in which trash was every where and homeless people lying around on benches, once inside the venue and about 2/3 way through his set here it comes, a tirade directed at Trump.It’s ironic that the carnies support a system that gives us trash in the parks and homeless people outside the venues yet the carny’s can’t get beyond theor hatred of the Orange man.This is not solved by soap boxes, ballot boxes, or jury boxes.We cannot live peacefully along side lunatics.

This!
The longer I live and witness our decline I become a stronger believer in Woodley’s concept of “Spiteful Mutants”.  Once the population reaches a hypothetical “tipping point” of such creatures, there seems no turning back from the inevitable decline.  Those who cannot observe the same reality as we do can not be endured.

They ALL took the ticket (all this world can be yours if you just follow me, said Satan) for their little prancing gig on a stage. If they fail to parrot their master’s lines, they will be pushed over into the eternal darkness. Which is waiting for them in any event.

        Over the last two generations, liberals have staged a revolution in American government while pretending only to modify the system. By contrast, conservatives have managed only modifications in the liberal system while claiming to have effected revolution. At the moment, it’s still the liberals’ country. Conservatives are just renting.

        Nah, I don’t see it. Normie is too complacent and/or beaten down. They drive by homeless encampments and figure “if I don’t toe the line, get to my cubicle on time I could end up there”. And with the internet surveillance so complete no radical organization will be allowed to be formed that is not riddled with informants. Trump always exceeds hi poll numbers cuz people are even afraid to admit they voted for him.
Remember the ending of 1984.

            Organization without infiltration is impossible. Unless it’s state approved.
Plenty of organized left wing violence in my lifetime.
Some right wing one off nutters (Oklahoma City, Uncle Ted) but nothing organized.

                    The thing I always noted from that case is that the government stated that they had gotten the blasting caps by stealing them from a mining site.  Okay, how did they know they were there?  How did they steal them and get away with it?  Etc.  And that’s just one piece.  Taken in total (especially given escapades that would occur through later years) it’s clear there was someone doing A LOT of handholding (in the least) for OKC.

                        One of those subsequent things was when the FBI basically assisted with the attempted assassination by Muslims of that obnoxious Jewish lady down in Texas.

                    Black Pilled (Devon Stack) did a deep dive on Waco that was extremely convincing.  At this point I assign zero credibility to the media noses version of events so if there’s another account that makes sense I’ll tend to think that’s true until further reliable information surfaces.Like I used to believe that mean guys had set up death camps with swimming pools and symphony orchestras, presumably because they just thought it would be more fun if the DEATH camp worked so slowly that I cant throw a rock without hitting a “survivor” of one 80 years later.  As a kid I always thought “if you just wanted to kill people why would you send them to a CAMP instead of shooting them all on the spot?”  No one ever satisfactorily explained that and I guess you’re just supposed to eventually take the clue and stop asking.Nowadays I keep asking

            Failing regimes tend to end quickly. The Assad collapse should be a warning to the West. No one saw it coming. The Turks who backed the “rebels” assumed there would be a fight and Assad would come to Erdogan to make a deal. Instead, the Assad government collapsed. The same thing happened to the Soviet system.
The West is far more fragile than it seems. It might take much to see Macron boarding a chopper to escape the country. Ditto the rest of the sissies and girl bosses in the EU.

                History turns on a dime.Some small occurrence that was ignored and the whole shebang falls apart. The diverse and not-quite- American-yet abandon their positions and seek to save themselves. There’s a classic Star Trek episode where the away team is scouting through a derelict ship and they find skeletons on the bridge and Worf says “they died at their posts-admirable”. Do we think the Musked Man and Donto have the stones to do the same?

Musk… maybe.  He’s certainly a fighter and a true believer in something… there’s no way he would’ve reached the heights that he has if he wasn’t.

                “It is only through the blood of these parasites and vermin that the new Western man will regain his lands and liberty. After the jury box comes the cartridge box.”
Mighty strong words, Z.
I can’t say I disagree — but I don’t foresee things popping off any time soon (if ever).
As the saying goes, “It’s too late to change anything, but too early to shoot the bastards.”

            Never underestimate the gullibility of whites. Already in Germany, UK, etc. we are seeing rare positive ads targeted at indigenous people to volunteer (or be “volunteered”) to protect a ruling class which hates them. Even some DR types can get all orgiastic when led to believe their betters don’t loathe them quite so much or want them dead. The latter assumption is all the more ironic when you consider what is being asked of them.

                This could be their final undoing. If they are enlisted and trained and prepared, they now sit on the arsenals. Do you think these feminized goofs won’t continue to sneer at the men and incite their righteous anger? Better they have guns in their hands and the ability to sight things then a remote control and alien game players to watch.

                    On the other hand, better our young guys, many of whom know better than any other generation what the time and score are. One of the biggest moves of the Trump admin was to immediately fire CQ Brown. Better to have the options presented when your guys are in and running the show.We have to look at things from the standpoint of having agency and being best positioned to exercise it. Until about 2014, were White men bamboozled by the GAE into unquestioning service? Yes. Since 2014? No. This is why The Regime is so scared and went balls to the wall in the pogrom of Whites from the military.Better a bunch of White men signing up then Tren de Aruagua and hostile ferals dominating the service. This gives you options to deal from the position of strength.We are at a very late phase. The guards make the King.

                    Seven years in the far hinterlands here amongst the legacy Americans. 30-plus yrs in the military myself. Cynical idealist, now squeezed kicking and biting into reluctant pragmatist.As to these people here and the military:They believe in America, passionately and fully. In agriculture, oil and the supporting industries, there are MANY who work hard and raise families. They generally support Trump. Well over 80% vote Republican.They believe the (old) military was a good place for a young man who wanted something different, who need to get out and mature, and who wanted to “serve”, which they still believe in.Often times, a young guy just wanted to get away, because, really, options are pretty limited out here. And they didn’t want to go to the big city and hang out with all the gender-studies majors.As I said earlier and in posts since I first was stranded here, they respect military service.But they are not stupid — there was the great falling off of their enlisting or seeking commissions because they were revolted by the leadership (mil &amp; civil), and what the military had become. In Trump, they see that as changing …. For now.  So they are again taking the risk.

                    I’ve seen articles stating recruitment was ‘up’, but since it was abysmally low before that – well it could just be number tweaking from an initial batch of trumptards signing up.  Not doubting you, just wondering if we have reliable sources and how much massaging is going on to promote the ‘go die for israel, goy’ narrative.

                    When regimes fall, it is often that they are kicked over by total lack of support from the military. Why not have a bunch of Our people dominating the military in number and rank who understand who the primary enemy is, and in a position to withdraw support.I just thought of something. I think a military recruiter should scour social media for those videos of young White boys getting savaged by ferals. They should approach them and offer them the training needed to be lethal. Talk about a highly motivated and conscious cohort. There are many ways to get creative and turn the energy of anarcho-tyranny against its purveyors.

It would make ash of itself before it let us.The military—any armed part of the government—is the hardest core of regime opposition tous, the original fount of doctrinal diversity, etc. We simply can’t have it. Joining it can only meanjoining it.Notice in recent news about Trump’s attempts to de-troon the force: The percentage of them is inwild disproportionto how many exist in the world. The military is job for sexual psychotics. This is not an accident or artifact of liberal weakness, not guys running a version of women soldiers’ pregnancy scam.Recognize your enemy. Recognize yourenemy unto death.

        Every time I allow a green shoot to sprout I come across something that zaps it. Listening to Mike Ferris’ Coffee and a Mike podcast with guest, the Irishman Ivor Cummins was one of these disheartening times. Ivor describes what’s happening in Ireland (and all the west) of the intentional flooding of his country with 3rd worlders. Ok, good so far. But then he describes interviewing Michael Yon and how Yon had labeled what’s going on as cultural genocide. Ivor then says he won’t release this interview because his wife told him (of course) that it’s “too dark.” So you understand that your people and culture are being destroyed, on purpose, but don’t want to call it genocide because that might give people the sadz? How can people like this ever get to the cartridge box when they can’t even get passed hurting other peoples’ feelings?

            IForgotmyPenThank you!!I thought it was just me.i like Mike Ferris’ podcast. He has some good interviewees on there.But this Ivor guy, I turned it off after less than 10 minutes in.Why?Becausehow the hell can one say “we’re being killed!” and then in the same breath NOT admit to reality that it is the town people doing it. And that the Irish as a people are White.And then more rubbish about not being rayciss.Give me an effing break.i also listened to part of the Ferris podcast recently with Mike Yon.Same thing: when Yon started taking about cultural genocide but somehow couldn’t bring himself to say the quiet part out loud, that Whotes are the victims of this cultural genocide, I again turned it off.And Mike Ferris the interviewer is. Good guy who says he Jsut lets his guests talk, to share their opinion.So I can’t work out if he is Jayden’s (there is some evidence of that, based upon his lack of verbal acuity) or if he was Jsut letting Yon speak his mind.But damn.I can’t work out if they are legit knuckleheads, or if Yon in particular (who never met a microphone he didn’t like) is unwilling to say the quiet part out loud.Thanks, Can’t Find Pen, for mentioning this. I’m glad I’m not the only one.

                That’s a good point, but the foot soldiers of the state,(police, Gestapo=all Fed law enforcement), must know that they will simply be the last ones to be arrested, regardless of whether they are heritage Americans or immigrants.

                        As I recollect from the USSR, the cops and soldiers had to not get paid for a year or two before they deserted. Most of them were dutiful enough to remain on the job for a good while. In AINO, more materialist, more all about the benjamins, I expect it would take a lot less time.

                    “…the foot soldiers of the state,(police, Gestapo=all Fed law enforcement), must know that they will simply be the last ones to be arrested…”A lesson here from the old country…Netherlands at the end of WWII.  The NAZI’s were pulling out, so they assembled their collaborators, the Groene Politie” (Green Police). The Green Police were the native enforcement arm for German edicts during occupation.The Green Police thought they were being assembled for evacuation to Germany (their masters and now their new home).  Instead they were executed.  Such executions occurred throughout Holland as the Germans wished to leave no witnesses behind for the “war trials” to come. Those collaborators not killed by the Germans were quickly taken care of by their fellow countrymen.So it has always been.

        That’s the great question we have yet to see an answer for- is Trump still a reformer, or will he be pushed and dragged into becoming a reluctant revolutionary by both his enemies and his younger allies (Musk and Vance especially). It is instructive to remember that the original Continental Congress was an extralegal body engaged in rebellion in 1775 that attempted reform and reconciliation with Britain until the summer of 1776, only then becoming a legal, sovereign body and “revolutionary” by declaring independence. A majority of that Congress were not political radicals or revolutionaries at the start in 1774, but became revolutionary. Jefferson himself made it clear that independence was forced on them bya long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government…

            Also, we should keep in mind that in historical examples of this phenomenon, it was never existential. The people of our Founding Fathers, the early Americans, were not on the chopping block to be genocided whether they stayed on the sidelines or fought, win or lose.All European ethnonations are under Great Replacement attack and if we lose not just our memetic patterns but our genetic patterns will vanish from the Earth. I think those with a gut-level understanding of this are still a minority, but that number will only grow because the signal is real. This changes ALL the rules and negates all the behavioral boundaries.

                “All European ethnonations are under Great Replacement attack and if we lose not just our memetic patterns but our genetic patterns will vanish…”Our genetic patterns—as in male and female?  I note with a bit of irony that since genetic analysis has been possible all the “population replacements” so far recorded seem to require to the extinction of the males of the populations in study, rather than the females of the genetic lineage under study.Yep, in ancient times, the females seemed happy to spread their legs for the new “boss”.  The males however, were eliminated.  Reich mentions this more than once in his book, “Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past”.When first I read of such, I didn’t think much about it, but now one needs only to watch the TV for a bit to see whom the White male replacement is being touted as—and it ain’t another white race.  Black pill for the day….

            I also suspect that they’re both very (very) slowly coming to the conclusion that they’re in a fight for their lives.  I know they can’t go from 0-60 at the drop of hat and put most of Congress and the judiciary against the wall, but I could hardly blame them if they did.

        People can and do point out that the ability to own firearm ownership in the US is a release valve meant to pacify people from the first 3 means of resistance. There’s some merit to that. For all of the people who have weapons and opinions, virtually none of them have fired a round in anger at the “apparatus.” The point that the parts of the country that most vehemently resisted the covid lockdowns were the most heavily armed parts can be shrugged off as legal firearm ownership being a relatively reliable proxy for politics in the US.That said, We have another interesting test case. I grew up thinking of Australians like the “Texas” of the commonwealths. They’re the only other Anglosphere nation that has been noted to have anything approaching a “swagger” when they travel abroad. They were reliably conservative until recent memory. They got one of the worst lockdowns in the entire Anglosphere, worse than New Zealand. They were putting people in ACTUAL concentration camps (in the original sense of the term). The difference between Australia and the other commonwealths (NZ, Canada, and the US if you ask Prince Charles, apparently)? They have some of the most restrictive firearms laws in any Anglo commonwealth nation prior to Jacinda “Mr. Ed” Ardern making stricter ones after the mosque shooting in NZ and Justin Castro’s new limitations in Canada. Australia’s are still arguably the toughest.I believe this is why a moderately conservative country that has had rampant anti-immigrant sympathies all throughout the 20th century among the hoi polloi got the worst treatment out of the far-more-progressive Kiwis and Canucks. Even if it isn’t explicitly mentioned in the clandestine committees (both private and public) who get together to figure out what they can foist on the populace, firearm ownership is there in the subconscious. The recent high-profile assassinations in the US have made that an explicit topic that no-doubt comes up when the typical ghouls assemble to see what they can get away with. Australians are down to dimensional lumber and harsh words if they can’t get their way politically, unfortunately.

            For all of the people who have weapons and opinions, virtually none of them have fired a round in anger at the “apparatus.”This is true, but for good reasons.  Sane people don’t throw their lives away to make a point.  Getting away with revolutionary violence is not easy.  Also, sensible folks know that their whacking one bad politician isn’t really going to do much.  Risk/Reward isn’t there.Once the system breaks enough that getting caught isn’t such a threat this might change.  The canary in the coal mine will be family court officials.  Once those people start winding up ventilated we’ll know it’s kicking off.

                I own and carry firearms but it is strictly for self defense against thugs. Under no circumstances would I use them against the police. I would be a dead man pronto. They might come in handy in a general social breakdown but once again it would be against the thugs who take advantage of such situations. Organized violence against the regime is mostly likely to come from the current law enforcement/military structure rather than from private militias (guys who’ve tried that soon found half their members were working for the FBI). I don’t get the feeling that either the military or law enforcement is anywhere near a state of rebellion. The closest thing we have seen to organized private violence were the Antifa/BLM goon squads but they were acting in the interests of the managerial state (and were financed by the oligarchs who benefit from the current system).

                Part of the problem is that we’re conditioned to accept the level of tyranny we have. A decade or more ago in “IIIper” circles, the popular saying was something along the lines of “if the Founding Fathers were still alive, we’d be done shooting by now.” They’re not wrong. Even if a borderline utopian like Jefferson (he had a change of heart in his late life) encountered gay rights activist and ethnic eskimo “Dan Savage” and somebody explained that the Constitution enshrined his right to talk about and advocate for gay outreach to kids, he would have said “Hang the Constitution and hang that man!” The victory of the gay rights agenda has been so total that we have “Gays against Groomers.” Gays are just part of life now rather than cause for war.The point is that sane people of 50 years ago would have thrown their lives away to prevent things that are accepted by most today and people 100 years ago would have thrown their lives away to stop things that were commonly accepted 50 years ago. The system made it too costly to be the first or fiftieth person to do something outside the system’s controlled game, excepting people with nothing to lose.I, of course, disavow crime and criminal activity and discourage people from engaging in it.

                    I won’t deny that boiling the frog is real.  We’ve certainly been desensitized to depravity.
Still, despite that, I’m often surprised by how much simmering hostility I can reveal by scratching the surface a bit.  Upon ‘feeling out’ a new person and deciding they’re normal or right-of-normal, it doesn’t take long to find the sore spot – the thing about pozzed America they hate.  Sometimes its as simple as talking about the sanctimonious yard signs the progs love so much.  Other times its the shit the schools are doing.  A thousand irritations keep filing away at tolerance/sanity.

                    A friend, years ago, disagreed with my disdain for social media, arguing that my assertion that social media poisons kids is akin to the previous generation saying tv ruined their offspring. My retort: “Couldn’t they both be true?” Every generation says the next is worse. That can be true, each and every time.

            This in true in part but the seeds of absolute tyranny have long been planted in Australian soil. I have mentioned it previously, but I lived and worked in Australia prior to the pretext for the gun grabbing, which was the Port Arthur massacre*, and visited and lived there briefly afterwards. The confiscation was widely resisted but few Australians knew about it because the propaganda outlets never discussed what was happening, which included widespread police violence against the populace. Every bad thing happening in the Anglosphere, including the over-the-top censorship, had a dry run in Australia long ago. The primary change after the gun confiscation was demographic catastrophe–of course. No one familiar with Australia was shocked that concentration camps were established there. Jailers settled the land along with prisoners.*It is likely the Five Eyes intelligence service either orchestrated the mass shooting or distorted what happened. Australia is such a police state that discussion of that aspect can and has resulted in prison time.

I tend to suspect the same of the “Montreal Massacre” here in Canada (and Columbine in the U.S.). That it didn’t result in the kind of blanket firearm illegalization as seen in the Australian, British and New Zealand examples, is probably down to the influence of our southern cousins’ much more firmly-embedded shooting culture.

                        Funny you mention Vegas, I was just discussing this with someone how it just went down the memory hole never to be mentioned again. It also shows how the only things they’re talking about “releasing the files on” are things that are just theater anyway. Who gives a damn about Epstein? We all know what that was about. How about Vegas? Hell, how about Ruby Ridge, Waco, OKC, January 6 (any details on the bomb found?), or any number of other mostly peaceful but also deadly events? Don’t worry though, Kash Patel is right on top of things!

                    That’s my understanding as well, but you will see no film footage of it. Australia doesn’t permit unpleasant things to be printed or broadcast. A friend there, migrating to East Europe now, told me police tactics to the gun raids were employed to terrify the populace. Even now, mentioning the internment camps set up for the vaccine refuseniks can result in a police visit or worse.

        The implied threat of the bullet box is probably one of the reasons the managerial leadership in the west have been so feverishly diluting their native White populations with the brown sewage flood in recent decades.  We can see how things have degraded, but all slop came from much worse, so to them, the west is heaven on earth, relatively speaking, and they’re far less likely to rock the boat.  Plus, the majority of guns are probably owned by boomers who are now in the checkout phase of life.  Unless/until the things get really, really shitty economically and/or lifestyle-wise, most likely not much is going to happen.  At this point, it’s only the left (as usual) engaging in any violence, so Trump is definitely pissing people off, which is good as it continues to reveal who our enemies are.

            Boomer here.  I and other “Boomers with more guns than teeth” have assembled a large collection of “personal defense artifacts”.  But we are not naive wrt such use/possession.  My children and grandchildren, as well as others I know have children/grandchildren, have *never*—and will never—purchased a registered firearm (which means all firearms essentially).  Instead, all of them have such bestowed as gifts and/or inheritance.  All are wise to the aspect of a future ban on such items and understand the need to stay out of the system.

                The only people actually willing to pop off at The System are urban Negroes — mostly because they are stupid and impulsive. Let’s face it, the situation in urban Negro ghettos has basically been a low-grade civil war for decades.Unlike the Negroes, whites mostly won’t do it because they have too much to lose, and are intelligent enough to understand that.Consequently you have Boomers with tens of thousands of dollars invested in guns who will never fire a shot in anger. By contrast you have Negroes practically every day in every city with a $59 Raven Arms or Lorcin .25 and three rounds of ammo willing to shoot a cop in a traffic stop.

        Yes. This is quite important.Relatedly we see a split has opened between the managerial class and the oligarchs who installed them. This has happened quite a bit previously in Latin America (which sort of includes the United States now). Rightwing death squads emerged in Central and South America once that point was reached. The United States earlier saw this with the initial labor movement and the use of Pinkertons and so forth.The Left is always down with violence, as we see unfolding, but once the Right (or “Right”/non-Left, to be accurate) reaches that point things get interesting. I incorrectly thought Cloud on Cloud violence would have happened already, but the Clouds may be prepared to engage outwards and finance judicial and other assassinations at this point. Elite violence normally is the only violence that matters. Peasants are easily handled. It likely won’t be Musk who pays for the first spiciness from the other direction–like Trump he is a True Believer in the system, but it is easy to see someone such as Thiel making death squads great again. Private justice is efficient justice and eventually becomes a cost of doing business.In Europe and France specifically, police outright threatened the Regime after recent widespread Muslim rioting, a story that quickly disappeared. Clouds there most likely will finance rogue gendarmes rather than private assassins to get business done.Reform indeed is impossible. Like perestroika and glasnost before it, national populism has failed due to the emotional incontinence and outright greed of the managerial class. Le Pen literally threw her late father under the bus and cucked on many things to no avail. If The Great Sort fails to act as an American valve, which so far it has, expect expensive weaponry and assassin professionalism to act as equalizers. As mentioned earlier, this has previously happened in the United States and what was old very well may be new again.

            I don’t put a lot of stock in local elections where I don’t know what’s happening on the ground. Sometimes the cuck candidate is odious but it was “his turn.” (Like maybe a Wisconsin McCain.) Maybe they should have run someone more personable? I don’t know if that’s the case, but it’s not that simple is my pointThe Wall Street Journal was crowing that the two Republicans in Florida won by smaller margins than their predecessors. That’s pure propaganda. New Representatives generally get elected by smaller margins the first time out. Once they become incumbents, unless they are completely bad at their jobs, they usually get up re-elected with similar margin as the people they replaced.

                Trusting in the ‘ballot box’ is trusting in the purported wisdom of ‘the people.’  Except the voters are increasingly not ‘our people’ (nor the judges or the elected ‘elite’).  It’s a fool’s errand.  Non-whites vote based on race and religion.  Women vote based on emotion (and whether she likes the candidate’s hair).  The whole concept that someone deserves a ‘turn’ in the interests of ‘fairness’ is kindergarden writ large – and that’s the level of the electorate.

                State senate seat was flipped in a special election here. Trump won the district by 15 pts, I read. I voted, turnout was abysmal, far as I could tell. Republican complacence, I’d say. Either that, or conservatives thought it impolite to keep winning.

Precisely.  This response is a good example of why the commentary here is worth reading.  Outside of rationale thought “bubbles” like this one, the world is one of propagandists and their narratives.  Critical thinking is anathema.

The fact that the odious, obese ogre from Ocala (Randy Fine) got in at all is such an indictment of Florida.  I couldn’t imagine having to live amongst such rabid zionists.  The picture Trump posted in his endorsement of Fine had the Israeli flag fully visible and the American flag mostly cropped out.  Eventually, we have to admit they’re simply mocking us at this point.

                    True. Look at the situation in the former country of South Africa, when faced with starvation-level food shortages, Malema screams, “It’s the White fault! They left the country and didn’t teach us how to farm, it’s their fault that we’re in this situation!”two hundred years from now, they’ll be saying things like, “It’s only been a little over two hundred years since we gained our freedom. We cannot be expected to recover so quickly from the damage done to our people.”I read something the other day and it dealt with “civilizational incompatibility” and why so much of the sewage that has flooded across our border cannot assimilate. Takeaway quote, “Europeans evolved to produce advanced civilizations. These other races evolved to exist.”

Gun control has absolutely nothing to do with crime. That’s just a pretext to bamboozle the grillers.
Gun control is to protect the government from the peasants.

Or the Escort woman and the auto pen, still a financial reckoning, maybe they’d have ‘nicer’ names, like “save our democracy’ or ‘pay their fair share’. Still bombing the Middle East. Funneling money there to our besties.

        This was a deep post today. This part is standing out to me now:“Of course, the UK has declared itself an apartheid state by imposing a two-tiered legal regime aimed at the opposition.”I don’t think an apartheid state is the right word. Apartheid was a state set up by an elite to promote the entirety of their folk as first class citizens in the face of a majority prone to savagery. It was a legitimate state in that sense.The UK, the GAE for that matter, is an entirely new type of state/regime. It is a Replacement State. The purpose of the state is to replace the folk with aliens. The entirety of what competence, will and zeal that it has is bound up in destroying the folk and importing a new one. This has never been done before. Not as an intentional, multi-continental civilization encompassing project.It is very important that we do not mince words. The Apartheid state was not evil when we look at it for what it was. It wasn’t really novel either. Only post WWII morality would call it evil for this new morality is an anti-morality that is defined by a hostile and malevolent intent to destroy its own people.That is what we face across The West. I think that is ultimately going to be what is going to require accessing the box of last resort. Of course, the folk are powerless, so it is going to take a miracle if they are the ones who are going to stand victorious.

        The chance of “grass roots” uprising here in the US is minimal. Europe is a different story. You could see grass-roots dissidents there getting supported by local police (fed up with migrants), elements of the army or secret police. The UK, Belgium, Ireland and Germany are lost but others could be saved. As usual, more pain is necessary because people never revolt until there is total economic or social chaos. Countries with a strong tradition of right-wing resistance, “race realism”, “ultra” football fans (fertile recruiting ground) are the most likely to save themselves. Think Italy and Spain, for example….

            The difference between the United States and Europe is the former’s vastness and the ability to sort and segregate. Recall the mostly futile attempts by the Biden regime to respond to this reality. The rubber hits the road once enclaves are firmly established and they are attacked. Europeans do not have that space and time luxury and have to act sooner. The United States can fragment and eventually dissolve but that opportunity is not available to Europe.

LOL. You are putting lipstick and eyeliner on “white flight”.
Sissyboy has no long-term future on this Earth while he refuses to improve his bad attitude and fears becoming a man.

                        In a way, I see the point Ride-By is making.  Imagine the frontiersman of 19th century America running away anytime the locals in his environment could be hostile (often, in some places).  No, the mindset was to crush – the frontiersman’s way was the dominant one, and he’d fight to impose it, even when outnumbered.

                            Ah, got it, I’m somewhat sympathetic to that take if that was his point. But the reality is that men with wife and kids have an option for now and it is a wise one to take. Over time that sorting will prove smart. There will come a time sorting is not possible and it will be a plus to be in a sympathetic enclave.

        With Trump, it is important to see what is reform and what is an amping up of the hopeless corruption of the system. The Golden Calf of mercantilism: the car commercials; the panopticon merchants; the amped up foreign predation … are all accelerants and increases in the outrages that will no longer be tolerated. Moreover, they will not solve the problems they are purported to solve. The debt is intractable and there is not a large enough productive class.On the positive side, if the pogrom of the military is being killed and reversed that sets the stage for the right outcome. If the 250th anniversary is patriotic and celebrates the Historic American Nation the energy release and meta-physical forces that will foster will summon the will that is essential to winning. The closing of the border and stopping that tidal wave along with some decent gains in deportations – enough to ensure one more win at the ballot box in ’28 is paramount. Enough cover and space for the Historic American Nation to bolster itself and increase separation is essential.They imported too many foreigners, gave them too much power and wealth and turned too many of our own people against the nation and their own people. Those people are convinced they are on the right side of history. They have a blood lust. Something has to give. Enter the war of the box of last resort.

        Beautiful post and couldn’t agree more. As Heraclitus said, war is the father of all things. And as someone else said more recently, if voting could change anything, they’d have abolished the ballot box a long time ago.

            From everything I read, what they got Le Pen on is common practice in France. Having campaign staff do other things is common in America too, even though it is technically illegal. It was not as if she was stealing tens of millions like Christine Lagarde. I think she got caught steeling a a hundred million Euros. Her punishment was appointment to head the ECB.

                        Betz talks about a dirty civil war; where infrastructure is destroyed cutting off power, water and pipelines that will cause mass chaos. He also talks about some guerrilla type groups and nothing like the blue and grey from the history books. Something more along the lines of the other third world countries we share a hemisphere with.

                            Think of the recent (March) power outage at London’s Heathrow airport. That was, so far as I know, an accidental failure of a single power substation. Yet it took Europe’s busiest airport off line for a day or more and massive disruptions. Now imagine if people started staging deliberate attacks on infrastructure. Betz mentions that. It’s difficult to defend against even random attacks. Against a person who has specialist knowledge and especially if he has munitions or other tools of destruction…watch out.

                            This is the most likely scenario I envision. Local, small group insurgent stuff that has outsized impact, and never telling a soul about it.
Seattle has seen something like this before. Rabid anti-gun prosecutor Thomas Wales was murdered in his own home in 2001. Case is still unsolved, and the authorities have no suspects at all.
It would not take much to turn a major blue city into an abattoir, and if several such cities had that happen at the same time…..

                    As Derb noted in his show, Betz can’t talk. He’s literally incapable of listenable speech.
So he’s on a speaking tour, hitting all the not-quite-our-guy podcasts, etc.
We should be suspicious about this.
(We should be suspicious of podcasters who arebad at reading superchats.)
If “civil war” comes to the UK and US, it’s the cops and military against white people (with brown semi-vigilante assistance, as needed). Betz roundaboutly makes the case that that’snecessary. It’s Millie with hisWhite Rage, spun differently.
It’s weird that we’re being told this (in an incoherent and annoying way).

We do well to be cautious of the messenger as well as the message. I think you’re waxing just a tad paranoid here, though. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Or in this case, an academic in a relatively obscure specialty enjoying his fifteen minutes of fame. Yes he’s written some books but none at risk of becoming a bestseller.

                “…even though it is technically illegal.”Everyone should pick up on this incident and take note—we are all guilty!Waay back when in my youth, I knew a production manager of a large corporation.  Was looking for a summer job and we got to talking about applications and filling out resumes and the like.  The topic drifted to “disqualifying” statements, i.e., drug use—like I said, it was a long time ago.  😉Long story short, he mentioned he loves to find lies on applications for employment.  Not that it usually turns into rejecting the applicant, but exactly the opposite.  In those days, lying on a job application was grounds for firing no matter when the lie is discovered.  No problems with the union, or State agencies.  Seems he’d simply make a mental note for future reference if the employment went sour.I’m wondering if such Le Pen and most other pol’s are not in the same boat with dossiers in the hands of the powerful.  Everyone is guilty of something sometime.

        The Wisconsin election went against the Republicans, which means that the Dems now have a good shot at retaking the house of representatives in 2026. If that happens, they will immediately move to impeach Trump and ramp up even more of their judicial lawfare. Here is where I see trouble coming. I don’t think Trump is in the mood to go back and rerun his first term. We may be seeing the first inklings of a future martial law. God help us.

                Maybe the most honest prayer I ever prayed was for God to punish me for the wrong I’ve done. Someone who seeks justice should desire no less. And a Just God would not inflict infinite punishment for wrongs (or sin, if you will), that are surely finite.

There have been some astonishingly evil nations in the past that pissed Him off. . . Old Babylon, Pharaonic Egypt, the Assyrians, the Hebrews when they’d go goddess.   But no nation ever stabbed Him and his peeps in the back like New Amerika.
I expect He will make an example of her.  A very longstanding example.

The very reason they’re attacking Teslas when they ‘ve never attacked big, evil polluting Chevy 3500 diesel trucks, is because they know the people in the Teslas are weak, while the pickup truck driver is more likely than average to be armed and willing to kick their asses.

                        Look, Rittenhouse did *everything wrong*.  He was one of the lucky ones who got away with it and survived. Grace of God thing. If you are serious, and somewhat experienced at life—not a kid LARPing—your chances of survival are much better, both legally and physically.
I applaud Rittenhouse’s luck, but that was it—luck.  The opposition always has the advantage against decent people, because they have no rules of conduct.  Learn to deal with such people before you engage and get destroyed by your own virtues.

Rittenhouse, Normie, probably ready to ‘enlist’ now that Trump is POTUS. Urrah.
Chauvin is ‘the man’ with all that entails … it was just his time to be thrown under the bus. Bad actor, bad outcome, made living in cesspool.

                            They attack in large crowds, trying to isolate single individuals. They’re cowards, and they chose poorly. Nobody thought that baby-faced  teen boy was a threat until they cornered him. It’s probably worth noting that those hired repeat criminal degenerate antifa shock troops were not Tesla owners, who tend to be affluent leftists, not quasi-homeless child molesters and woman beaters. It was the Tesla owners I said were weak.

                I don’t think it is even that complicated. The television/Blue Sky told them Musk and Tesla are evil and they acted out after the Holy Voice spoke to them. Granted, EV’s are in Blue shitholes and as you point out the owners are generally pussies, so there is that.

                Perhaps that also speaks to the inorganic nature of the Tesla vandalism. Probably most of it is paid activism, and a small amount is just dumb redditors who key a car because they see that it’s cool now.

        Meanwhile the traitors whose goal is to save Social Security and Medicaid, have half the divided tribe with the “conservatives”, arguing for amnesty of some sort.https://americanmind.org/features/from-illegal-immigrants-to-republican-voters/prudential-immigration/The fines should be set to cover all of the money spent to bring them here and house and clothe and feed them and their families.A country’s first duty is not to save its ponzi schemes from ruin and hopeless corruption, but to save and preserve its people.I am really tired of these people and their golden calf worship. If you want to save those programs, reconstitute the American Colonization Society and get rid of the vast albatross that drains its coffers and deport all of the immigrants whose families free ride off of these systems.We don’t need them to save us. Wall St. and the permanent bureaucracy need them to save themselves and prop up their ponzi schemes.

        This is a fairly grim essay today, particularly because it is likely correct. It’s a reality for which any tears shed would likely be a waste. Human relations at the mass collective level are always a precarious matter anyway. This conflict-oriented species of ours appears headed for more of that turmoil it has known all too well through so much of history.

        Trump is not a reformer.  He’s a disruptor.  Notice how the 2018/19 tariffs never went away after Biden was installed.  Trump completely wrecked the “free trade” lies we’ve been told for 40 years.The reciprocal tariffs?  He’s not calling them reforms.  He’s calling today “Liberation Day”.  That is a very radical, not reformist, name for what he’s doing.  It is pure economic warfare.  If you shoot at us, we are shooting back.Soap, ballot, and jury boxes are used as metaphors, not literal things.  (I’ve sat on juries, voted, and expressed my political views…none of which involved a “box”.). Same with the cartridge box.  There are many other weapons.  That’s why these other counties are acting like we’ve attacked them physically.Anyway, back to Trump the Disruptor.  You don’t always know and can’t always predict the aftermath of a major disruption.  The EU economy is a parasite on the US.  It’s not clear yet how reciprocal tariffs will affect them.  But loss of the US security umbrella, combined with tariffs, could lead to a financial crisis that upends their cheery social welfare programs leading to unrest.Then again, there’s Russia.  Sanctioned into the void, they had to come up with a separate economy free of the Swift system.  BRICS seems here to stay.  The Russian economy seems to be doing fine.  The sanctions have been disruptive, but not in the way intended.  That’s why Trump issuing threats is a pathetic joke and he knows it.Here at home, we don’t know yet what the big disruptive policies are going to yield.  The courts have been trying to stop Trump, with some success.  But imagine what happens if millions of illegals go home, half the government workforce is forced out, spending is cut, and companies are forced to repatriate factories.Those are bullets, too.

            The present system would regard that as an “incel power fantasy.” A core current_year principle is that men who have bad lives deserve worse lives, that those screwed by fate or circumstance should beofficiallyscrewed also, that the true self of every loser is theabsoluteloser. (Our rulers are indeed “natural conservatives.”)So the old incel Captain America has been swapped for a true modern moral paragon: some black guy. I don’t keep up with the genre, but I’ve seen fans complain that he has no characteristics. He’s just right and bitchy about everything, like a “girlboss” (but it’s some black guy).The old white Captain, having lived as bothunterandüber, had a stereotypically American justice-for-all type attitude, rather than underclass resentment or overclass sadism. The current_year hero hasboth.

Trump and Musk are not super-patriots. Both are A-type billionaires. One was slighted by chocolate Jesus that motivated him and the other became political after buying a social media platform and was attacked for it.

                He is also a paperwork-only American. I saw some fool normie opining yesterday on what a ‘patriot’ Musk is for his DOGE work. The oligarchy support reducing fraud for two reasons: (1) the uncontrolled portion of it isn’t going to them and (2) the uncontrolled nature means that it isn’t being calibrated to merely shear rather than kill the sheep. They all have their own projects which will fail if civilization collapses around them. This is naked mutual self interest, and the Heritage American interest isn’t in slowing down the bleedout, but in the massive loss of systemic legitimacy that accompanies verified and publicized government-wide fraud.The huge red flag is his reaction at the notion that his H1B’s could work on his projects from Bangalore rather than from America. I won’t forgive or forget his enraged and entitled “I will fuck your face.” He needs to be remigrated, too.

        But the earthly city, which shall not be everlasting (for it will no longer be a city when it has been committed to the extreme penalty), has its good in this world, and rejoices in it with such joy as such things can afford. But as this is not a good which can discharge its devotees of all distresses, this city is often divided against itself by litigations, wars, quarrels, and such victories as are either life destroying or short-lived. For each part of it that arms against another part of it seeks to triumph over the nations though itself in bondage to vice. If, when it has conquered, it is inflated with pride, its victory is life destroying; but if it turns its thoughts upon the common casualties of our mortal condition, and is rather anxious concerning the disasters that may befall it than elated with the successes already achieved, this victory, though of a higher kind, is still only short-lived; for it cannot abidingly rule over those whom it has victoriously subjugated. But the things which this city desires cannot justly be said to be evil, for it is itself, in its own kind, better than all other human good. For it desires earthly peace for the sake of enjoying earthly goods, and it makes war in order to attain to this peace; since, if it has conquered, and there remains no one to resist it, it enjoys a peace which it had not while there were opposing parties who contested for the enjoyment of those things which were too small to satisfy both. This peace is purchased by toilsome wars; it is obtained by what they style a glorious victory. Now, when victory remains with the party which had the juster cause, who hesitates to congratulate the victor, and style it a desirable peace? These things, then, are good things, and without doubt the gifts of God.But if they neglect the better things of the heavenly city, which are secured by eternal victory and peace never ending, and so inordinately covet these present good things that they believe them to be the only desirable things, or love them better than those things which are believed to be better-if this be so, then it is necessary that misery follow and ever increase.﻿

        Great post. One of the secondary reasons I think there will be wars abroad is to prevent, or at least delay, war at home. Give the young men a regime approved outlet for their aggression and frustration, and at the same time stymie reform efforts by making Trump a war president.
This was essentially the same strategy they employed with George W. Bush after 911 (although his proposed reforms were less salutary and disruptive than Trump’s).  Whether or not it is successful depends on keeping the body count low, which will be problematic in Iran, and impossible in Russia.

            Another way this could go would be to make it pro-civilizational. What if instead of Russia or Iran, they went to truly liberate Western Europe. What if they were enlisted to help Sweden reclaim the no-go zones? Split the force into a domestic territory reclamation force and a European one. It would make sense to use our military for this good and it would build a fortress of a castle of men who acted to save Western civilization.

            I suspect this is even more true of Europe and reason the managerial class there is pushing for war with Russia.

                The only problem I have with this opinion is it seems to fly in the face of the fact that the West is casualty adverse.  Ukraine has suffered immense casualties—and that was in the face of an invasion upon it soil.  Will the Europeans tolerate the body bags coming home for a war that hypothetically affects their sovereignty?  Even when the EU would send the GAE troops in the sand wars, it was pathetic in numbers and usually relegated to behind the lines support.

                    Among the “leaders” and the managerial class, I’m not sure the casualty aversion exists if the enemy is seen as sufficiently evil (and white). Nobody in Vietnam or Iraq was even a tenth so vilified as Putler. The hatred and disdain you see expressed for common Russians on social media (no doubt much of it astroturfed) did not exist at all for Vietnamese and Iraqis.

        It is only through the blood of these parasites and vermin that the new Western man will regain his lands and liberty. After the jury box comes the cartridge box.
