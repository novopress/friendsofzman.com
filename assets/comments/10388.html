        I‚Äôm old enough to remember when black families were not only patriarchal, but black fathers were the embodiment of suffering integrity and they tenaciously held their families together despite the turmoil of third class status in multi-ethnic society that demanded you fight your way up the ladder to assimilate. These men worked incredibly hard and largely suffered in silence; aided only by fiercely loyal wives and a strong church community.You can thank Lyndon Johnson, and his fellow Democrat back-stabbers, that killed this cultural black institution and replaced it with the Great Society Program. The end result was that strong black fathers were driven into exile and their women were seduced into government dependency via addiction to welfare heroin.It heartens me to hear that women like Queenie are fighting back.

            Got everything right except that last sentence. Queenie should be a man with a family.

        I suspect politicians of these decaying metropolises are more than willing to accept garbage bags because cities get a certain amount of federal reimbursement depending on their size.  Foseti is another flea on the dog, but as a government employee, he‚Äôs useful to explain to us in Dirtsville how the federal government works.  If municipalities can‚Äôt keep people, they can‚Äôt get the government money.The liberal Protestant churches and Catholics have colluded in a weird way for government cash as well.  In most cities, the WASPs and ethnic white Catholics have all fled the city leaving declining tithing for the local liberal Protestant churches and CAtholic parishes.  The remaining congregants are dying of old age.  Where to get money? The Federal government, of course!  Let‚Äôs become a refugee resetllement organization!   I bet this is how parts of Michigan were turned into the Middle East.  Rather than stop the underlying cause of white flight (black violence), it was better to import an entirely new population.  The politicians agree for other reasons.Now the poltiicians are trying to whip us all back into the city with gasoline taxes, bad/immigrant-clogged roads, and SEction 8ers in the suburbs. WE THE PEOPLE (actual Americans) seem to be wise to it this time

            Do you know what the deal was besides selling a bunch of military stuff?  Trump is no fool and he knows who the Saudi‚Äôs are.  I give him the benefit of the doubt having done big business in NYC and having to deal with the mob, unions, and other elements like city inspectors.  And that is just in NY.  He has had business relationships around the world with many kinds of people.  So what may appear to be ‚Äúrotten‚Äù is only what we see.  We don‚Äôt know the rest of his plan or how it will unfold.  Give him a chance.I think you would agree that he has done a far sight better than Obozo bowing to others, apologizing around the world and sending all kinds of money to the Muslim Brotherhood which should be labeled a Terrorist Organization along with CAIR.Also, I am glad he is pissing off people like Merkel by saying things she doesn‚Äôt like.  I say ‚ÄúTough titties!‚Äù  Suck it up Buttercup!  There‚Äôs a new Sheriff in town and no more pansy ass, limp wristed, girl bike riding poser as head of the US.

                I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs pissing off Barreness Merkel and Macron (isn‚Äôt that some kind of cookie?).  Really, truly I am. Brings a smile to my face every time.Past results are no guarantee of future performance, but it seems that every time the U.S goes into the negotiating room with the Saudis, we come out with a lot of obligations on our part and a lot of shaky promises from them.  There are two reasons for that:1. The Saudis always lie.2.  SA is a feudal state. King ‚Äúpromises‚Äù to do something. And that affects Prince Haidar bin Salami‚Äôs ability to ship $100M‚Äôs of Petro Dollars to Salifi scumbags approximately 0%.I dunno. Maybe if we get them to buy a few $100B of military stuff, that reduces Haidar‚Äôs ability to send a few $100M on Wahabi masjids and suicide bombers. Plus I‚Äôm all for keeping the Saudis in the fight with the Shia. I hope they really both do lose this time.

                    The thing that came to my attention during Trumps visit to ‚ÄúThe Kingdom‚Äù was how the Saudi‚Äôs have apparently changed their approach to Wahhabi-ism since it has turned on them and is threatening their monarchy, i.e. bite them in the ass.  So how is that for keeping faith with the Koran and walking the talk?Regardless of the KSA, the entire region is threatened by radical Islam as well as the west and as is well know, ‚ÄúThe enemy of my enemy is my friend.‚Äù  So if they spend their oil money to buy our weapons, so be it.  To fight these idiots, they don‚Äôt need the latest and greatest technology, just lots of it.  Good for American jobs and profits.  But it better be hard cash, not credit and I am sure Trump knows better on that score.

        The other thing is, Western politicians are ‚ÄúAll in‚Äù on Islam.  I think it was Daniel Greenfield who made this point, but for Western politicians to repent about the millions of Muslims imported to the West is impossible.  No one in the managerial class can repent of a peccadillo, much less of an error so large as to destroy an entire civilization.  No! Much better to go ‚Äòall in‚Äô on the problem rather than turn about.  You see this on shows like ‚ÄúHOmeland‚Äù where there‚Äôs an American who turns Turk but he ‚Äòmisunderstands‚Äô Islam and goes on a violent jihad.  He is portrayed against ‚Äòpeaceful‚Äô Muslims who tell him he isn‚Äôt a true Muslim (despite Mohammed‚Äôs campaign of ethnic cleansing in his Medinan period).  You also see it in movies like ‚ÄúZero Dark Thirty‚Äù where a big-fish intelligence bureaucrat is interrupted while banging his head towards Mecca and the bureaucrat interrupting his salat kicks around a few surahs with him.This attitude seems to pervade the whole managerial class.  I knew a manager whose friend was killed in a jihad attack on a US armed forces recruiting station in Tennessee, of all places.  Xe still can‚Äôt bring ximself to say anything critical about Islam nor doubt that we should have unlimited Muslim immigration.When you think about it, if the US government of the early 20th century had the same attitude it has today, we‚Äôd have let zero Armenian refugees in.  They all would‚Äôve died at the hands of the Turk just as we‚Äôre letting Daesh massacre all of the Near Eastern Christians today.

        I know the plutocrats in the countries of origin make big money off renumerations/wire transfers (I think Ann Coulter talked about Carlos Slim taking his cut from every dollar that goes back to Mexico). American banks are obviously complicit, and in on the take, though I don‚Äôt know the details.I‚Äôm not sure how black Muslims (Farrakhan/Prison conversion types) are going to mix with real Muslims, who regard the ‚ÄúYakub/White man is the devil‚Äù stuff as weird apostasy. Blacks are already feeling the sharp elbows of Hispanics in the ‚Äúrainbow coalition,‚Äù so I think they must understand that by now even progressives have lost interest in them and have moved on to Muslims and transgenders, etc. We‚Äôll still be told to worship the random mulatto athlete/politician, but I think for black people it‚Äôs back to the back of the bus.

            TelCo‚Äôs make money on phone cards and burners. Carlos Slip owns the Mexican wireless business so gets a piece of the phone home business. Banks on both ends get their beak wet on the remittances. About $30 billion a year is sent by illegals back to the home country. Human trafficking is big business.

            Organs like Western Union get paid by the small business for using the name and the network, plus they get a percentage of the amount transferred and they make some on the foreign exchange rates.  They have the game wired coming and going.  The banks do the same.  It is all a poor man‚Äôs version of wire transfers where the provider doesn‚Äôt get too greedy as to draw attention to themselves or the ire of those poor sending remittances home.

        As someone who has been following on-going developments with the Trump Administration since it‚Äôs inception, I find it curious that Zman would place much credence in stories from the MSM that are basically rumors with no ‚Äúofficial‚Äù announcement from the White House.Every day there are stories, rumors, innuendo galore attacking Trump, associates or family.  There has always been an immigration policy for the U.S. and I am sure you would agree that what is important here, and no facts are provided, is just what this supposed change in policy has to do with the Middle East countries that are suspect.I would encourage all to pay more attention to The Conservative Treehouse (The Last Refuge) for some solid interpretations of what is going in the Trump universe and that of his many enemies in the Deep State and on the Left.  Sundance, who writes much of the content there is on par with our own Zman for brilliance, analysis and word craft.If you are doubting Pres. Trump, I would say to you ‚ÄúCheck your sources.  What are you reading lately?‚Äù  All consider the source.

            @ LetsPlay ‚Äì Interesting. I too read into the comments that thezman is not that impressed with the achievements and accomplishments (or lack of) by President Trump so far.Of course we (over here) are hearing all about him calling the Germans ‚Äúbad‚Äù and shoving the prime minister of Montenegro and of course the ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù hand shake issue with French President Macron. To be honest, no one really cares about those things. They just make good gossip-news headlines. But it does same something about his character, which isn‚Äôt good.Imagine he shoved your father like that, would you be okay with it? It‚Äôs not the act of shoving the man, it‚Äôs the lack of respect that‚Äôs really at the core of the issue.I understand his ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù attitude and I think it‚Äôs about time you had a president who promoted such a position. As America goes, so goes the world ‚Äì as they say. His tactics may have worked in boardroom deals, but I hope he learns that alienating friends and allies is not the best way to go about doing it.

                Yes Karl, our President was rough on the sensitive leaders of Europe.  They are so cultured and refined that any hint of masculinity or demanding of respect is seen as so backwards.  I think we have to admit we don‚Äôt know everything that went on behind the scenes but you have to admit that he did not receive a very warm reception.  Not that one would be expected after their ‚Äúfriend‚Äù Obozo has left the stage of Office and now they have to deal with this brash character.  It is not of their choosing.  But it is the choosing of so many American people.And as one of the Deplorables, I think I can speak for them when I say that their cold shoulders, their behind the hand snide remarks during his speech, their year-after-year deadbeat status paying on NATO contributions (most of the countries) while being able to build a brand new HQ location, and their lifestyle bought and paid for by the American soldier and taxpayer (their freedom), are enough to make red-blooded American take umbrage at the nose-in-the-air attitude of these leaders who think they are so great and so entitled to so much.Don‚Äôt get me wrong.  I do not lump all people‚Äôs, like the German people in with their leaders, they work hard and are creative and innovative in many ways that contribute to the global economy but they do wear some responsibility for keeping these people in power.So as much as Europeans might not like it, we are who we are.  We are not pussies.  I like to remember the English, who while being provided with provisions and arms by the U.S. during WW2, and in the build up to the invasion of Fortress Europe, said about Americans GI‚Äôs, ‚Äúthey are overpaid, overfed, oversexed and over here‚Äù.  That was written by a British comic named Tommy Trinder (1909-1989) but the sentiment while humorous is still based on the honest feeling that we, Americans were still not really wanted.  No one likes to be saved and the fact is Europe has been saved twice by the US and the countries don‚Äôt like to remember that fact.  But they don‚Äôt learn from history and won‚Äôt invest in protecting themselves.  Of course, a big part of that is the fault of American politicians and the MIC who have made a lot of money for decades since the end of the war ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù Europe from the Soviet horde.  And now the Russian horde is knocking at the door.  So whatchagonnadoaboutit?  Call Uncle Sam?

        Throw in the clannishness of the Muslims being imported by Donald Trump,
Burka = non person hood?
But you mean this group arrived AFTER 1/21, or better yet later?It is just as disingenuous to blame Trump for the status quo after 8 years of Obama as when CNN MSNBC does it.I think the State Department needs to be drained ASAP, but the mid level bureaucrats still have power to do their mischief.
In any case, the dynamic will be interesting.  Someone should hack and disable Western Union (I was thinking EBT cards, but that should be second).

Your answer: ‚ÄúOh, I was busy making excuses for elected officials and fantasizing about ‚Äòhacking‚Äô.‚Äù
POTUS worship started very early in our nation‚Äôs history.  Political parties only added to the fervor.  Witnessing first hand the cults following Reagan and every chief after killed any hope boomers would demand accountability.  The blind-eye many of you stubbornly cast on Trump‚Äôs poor choices simply adds another chapter to a book one step closer to its end.

        Z Man;Interesting observation about the potential Black Matriarchy vs. Muslim Patriarchy conflict.  AFAIK, Black Muslims are predominantly males converted in prison.  I‚Äôd guess that part of their motivation is rejection of female domination.  Females of all races have the powers of the state on their side and at their summons in cases of male-female conflict.  You would know better than I how far the writ of the state runs in the ghetto but my sense is that it‚Äôs none too far.  So, who wins_?It‚Äôs easy to see that if the contest is 1-on-1 physical conflict, the male wins until the state steps in.  Then, usually the male loses and life goes on as before.  But what if your baby-daddy comes back cleaned up but demands you become one of the black blobs *and* is able to marshal some of the juice of the Moslem Brotherhood law-fare wedge_?

            &gt;what if your baby-daddy comes back cleaned up but demands you become one of the black blobsMost women prefer a man who‚Äôs willing to be a man to breeding drones.Of course, it‚Äôs a question of how much a man raised with no father by a mother on welfare/government job, with guys marching in and out of the bedroom, is able to transform himself in accordance with the Muslim idea of manhood, and of how much a woman raised in the same environment is able to change to accommodate.As far as I know from reading Umar Lee‚Äôs blog comments back in the day, the black Muslim convert community is trying to figure out how to deal with black pathologies and Muslim ones at the same time.

Just having your baby-daddy come back is unusual enough. If he got him a J-O-B and be wanting to stay around and support you, you gone do what he say. Expecially if he be acting all strong and about god and everythang, and not running around wit otha ho‚Äôs like he done before.

        I drove through my old neighborhood to see the house I lived in the first several years of my life. It is a black slum now. The roads leading toward the freeway are littered with empty stores, a mall that is eighty percent unoccupied, and what businesses that seem to be operating all have Spanish names. Maybe the idea is to bring in Mexicans and Muslims to push out the blacks‚Äìdoing the jobs Americans won‚Äôt do‚Äìbecause foreigners aren‚Äôt on a white guilt trip.

        Despite being deeply, indescribably, unspeakably offended by the insensitivity Zman displays, and the crimethinkingness of his opinions, I am very interested in the question he poses. Since the America federal government has decided to bring in Muslim refugees in quantity and dump them in the inner city ghettos, whose inhabitants are as far away from them as possible in culture and customs, how will this play out?Law enforcement will not be a factor, since it‚Äôs mostly retreated to its stations and patrol cars, venturing out only for the drug raids that bring that sweet fed money (and confiscated drug dealer money and goods.)Anecdotally, guys are shooting dope in the open right across from the Baltimore police stations, or jacking passerby in plain view of cops. Nobody wants to be the next Darren Wilson.I think that the relationship between the incoming Muslims and the black ghetto residents will eventually be something like the relationship of Arabs and blacks in Subsaharan Africa before the European conquests. Low level warfare on both sides, exploitation, probably the return of slavery (plenty of people are willing to sell their kids-the American Eastern seaboard is littered with the bones of European kids who were sold by their parents into servitude and then worked to death by their Puritan, Cavalier and Quaker owners.)

        Haven‚Äôt seen much of that around here. On rare occasions you might see three or four garbage bags roaming up and down the aisles.Of course it‚Äôs still early in the game.  Boston and satellite cities could definitely be overrun just like other areas of the country.Not sure what kind of conflict could ensue. People have been predicting a war with the blacks and Hispanics but they seem to have an uneasy truce at least for the moment.One thing‚Äôs for sure if the Moose limbs pull any of their crap in the ghetto there will be some swift street justice.Then there will be a call to move them out to the suburbs. Once we start to see the killings that go on in England,  France and Germany will be interesting to see if America will finally pull its head out of its ass and get rid of this human plague .

            Trump can halt the so-called refugee program if he wants. He could put the brakes on Muslim migration too, despite the jerk-offs on the bench trying to stop him. He could simply require that all visa applications be sign by him. No court could touch him.
Look. Trump is merely an instrument. I have no emotional commitment to him. He is only as valuable as he is useful. So far, on the issues that matter, he is proving to be useless.

                        Obviously easily offended, Trump is likely easily flattered as well.  That was my thinking.  Interesting how Trump was surrounded by Saudis carrying swords and sidearms during parts of his visit.

                Trump has sided with the Sunnis against the Shiites. This is pretty obvious. He surely had to give something up to get such an ostentatiously ‚Äúwarm‚Äù reception from the Saudis (an obvious signal to the Muslim world) as well as their overt and covert help against Iran. Obama did the reverse as he saw Iran as the best way of of neutralizing if not annihilating Israel, who he hates. I trust Trump‚Äôs motives much more than I do/did Obama‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt trust the Saudis nor anyone in the ME and Trump probably doesn‚Äôt either. At least I hope he doesn‚Äôt. That said, this business of choosing sides is ingrained in humans: in politics, international affairs and life. We often choose wrong, but we do choose.

                Politicians could also propose something along the lines of the 1924 Johnson-Reed Immigration Act, which banned immigrants from specific regions of the world deemed troublesome to the country. It bothers me that with all the discussions around this topic, few pundits have brought this up. It imposed quotas on Italians, Japanese, and Chinese, for starters.

                    The difference between the Congress passing a law and the President issuing an edict is what the court is being asked to decide. Congress routinely delegates its authority to the Executive and this is one example. The Executive gets to set the rules for entry. The Court is now saying he is disqualified from exercising this power due to past statements they interpret as bigoted. The most recent ruling says the Court‚Äôs undefined and mystical understanding the Equal Protection Clause applied to foreigners demanding entry.The Court is leading us down the road to lunacy, in which our Constitution prohibits us from keeping foreigners out of the country. That‚Äôs an untenable paradox, which is probably why the SCOTUS will have to settle it.

                I‚Äôm not surprised, My assumption is that Trump was there to maybe try and stabilize the economy so his family business of shady real estate deals and middle to high end hotels and casinos could continue for a while longerDespite big words, a betrayal was almost certainly inevitable and expectedStill that buying time lets the rest of  us stock  up on ammo and supplies for the fun times and the long overdo end of the union.And no it ca‚Äôt be salvaged except under fairly extreme circumstances, functionally elimination of the old order and an .Alt Right despotism capable of forced homogeneity  , pre 65 demographics, and end to leftism  and an economy that encourages long term work for menUnless there is some hidden pool of colonels , we can‚Äôt  have a circulation  of the elite so we are left with implosion.Trump  likely  true purpose is to give hope than to yank it away which allows the energy needed for change, an anent of Chaos or Kek if you feel like it.I think in some ways the elite know this which is why they hate him. They‚Äôve always know it, hence his appearances as President on the Simpson‚ÄôsHe is one of the horsemen of the end of the nationAll that rambling aside, I‚Äô give him a year maybe two  before i fully judge. He needs to have secure footing which he doesn‚Äôt have if, big if he wants to try and fix anything substantive without being Kennedy‚Äôd or Nixon‚Äôd

        I thought of the Zman when I read this last week and saved it for the next time he mentioned IQ.I‚Äôve an IQ of 95, is it too low?Bill LennanTrue story.I went to high school with a guy who could barely read.His attendance was poor at best and he dropped out after his junior year.He would have likely had scored a very low IQ just because his reading was so bad.He was also an OG waterman ‚Äì spear fisherman, surfer, sailor.He purchased his first house at 20 and was looking for tax shelters at 25. He was NOT a drug dealer.He got into the family business as a kid, proved he had the business chops to run the show before he was 18, continued to grow the family fortunes until I lost track of him.The guy outperformed MBAs all day long.He didn‚Äôt care about IQ. He cared about happy employees, repeat ( and happy ) customers, and growing the business. He had amazing emotional intelligence (EQ).As others have mentioned ‚Äì IQ isn‚Äôt a great metric for life or career success. It just means you can do well on a particular type of test. The real world doesn‚Äôt care about your test scores ‚Äì but it does care about your EQ.Work on your EQ ( it‚Äôs growable ) and rock the world üôÇ

                I think the two things that are relevant is that intelligence is both nature and nurture, and that testing can‚Äôt always capture that.
That‚Äôs why I have to take issue when people say that our immigrants have low IQ. Do they have low IQ because they they come from certain cultures where they don‚Äôt have an organized, logical approach to thinking, or do they just not have the raw brain matter? I think that is an important distinction that should first be considered before making blanket assumptions about immigration.

        ZMan, the brief Washington Examiner article linked on increasing refugee quota is not quite accurate due to its having been spun off  an article in the New York Times.  That article had far more detail, and made it clear that, although President Trump wanted the refugee limit reduced, the State Department had made the decision to increase it.  But it‚Äôs not as wide open as the Examiner article would have us believe.  Never a fan of the NYT, I have to say they tried to be more accurate in their reporting.  Here is the NYT article from another source that doesn‚Äôt have a paywall:http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/us-quietly-lifts-limit-on-number-of-refugees-allowed-in/ar-BBBz5Bs?li=AA4ZnC&amp;ocid=spartandhpAnd the limit was lifted, not done away with.
