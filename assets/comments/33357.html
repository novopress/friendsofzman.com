        I had an inside view of DC journalism in the 1990s and early 2000s. What Z writes about was already evolving but not yet set in stone. There were still a few old-timers, some who didn’t even have a college degree, but they were on the way out.Btw, the no-college or state college older guys always worked the DC bureau of a regional paper not one of the big players, NY Times, WaPo, LA Times and a few others. However, even then, newspapers were starting to feel the pinch from the internet, so the regional papers were starting to close their DC bureaus.The younger DC reporters working for either big papers or AP were almost always from Ivy League schools or Northwestern or Missouri which had big journalism schools. These were well-off kids who grew up in nice suburbs of DC, NY, Philly, LA, Boston or, maybe, Chicago. They were born and raised in the managerial class and felt very at ease with it.You would occasionally get some normal young guy who went to a normal college and had happened to kind of fall into journalism as a “fun” job, but they never lasted. First, they generally weren’t that special kind of limousine liberal that you find in DC, NY and LA. Sometimes, they were even conservative, which made them the odd man out.But it was less politics than personality the weeded people out, even some liberals. To move up meant being a part of the DC scene. You needed to go to the never-ending events, charity parties and general bar/social scene. That’s where you got face time with editors, staffers, NGO people, donors, etc. If you didn’t like these events or people, you weren’t going to get that promotion.As Z notes, it was access journalism, but it was more than that. It was a way of life, a very nice way of life in many ways. However, one thing that always irked these strivers was the pay. Rank and file reporter salaries, even the ones at WaPo or NY Times, wasn’t great. Sure, the occasional, lucky reporter could hit it big and make some money, but most languished. This definitely bothered them.Also, almost none of them actually wanted to be regular reporters. They went to Columbia or Harvard; they shouldn’t snooping around calling some cop. Most wanted to be columnists or writing political books. The reason that you don’t have much reporting these days is that none of them wanted to be reporters in the first place. They wanted to be political writers, hob-knobbing with the good and great as an equal.Anyway, that was the scene way back then. I’d assume that those forces only intensified as the internet consolidated things.

            The internet destroyed the business model of newspapers – classified advertising. It also dented regular advertising. All editorial independence collapsed (the remaining advertisers were all corporate) and resources for actual reporting (which is expensive) vanished. Were it not for the fact that the major newspaper companies diversified into local TV, cell phones and baseball teams etc, they would have gone bankrupt long ago. The NY Times is the only major paper that didn’t meaningfully diversify and still survived.

                Yeah, the writing was on the wall, though the papers couldn’t figure out how to deal with it.
I’m more talking about the DC journalism scene than the newspaper business in general, though they definitely overlapped. A lot of the DC reporters switched to PR for the various organizations around DC.

                I disagree.  This is the fantasy the media tells itself, but they forget the newspaper industry began the collapse in the early 80s.   If they had a quality product, they could sell it either digitally or paper based.  Lots of people still buy paperback books. Millions of e-books are sold for a profit every year.The problem with the newspapers, at least, is they have a crappy product tailored to a small slice of people in a national audience.   They should be primarily focused on local news and stories aimed at a general local audience rather than a progressive audience across the US.  This market is already saturated.

                    Tars: why are you disagreeing with me? It’s straight facts regarding the revenue base of major city dailies. Meanwhile, local newspapers have been gobbled up by national chains like Gannett (USA Today), Hearst, Lee and McClatchy (Sacramento Bee etc). All these companies diversified into TV/Radio also and that’s why they survived. They have executed the exact strategy you suggested. Those who didn’t (Knight-Ridder in Philadelphia) went bust. Affiliated (Boston Globe) had enormous holdings in McCaw Cellular (now ATT) and that’s how it kept going before selling to the NY Times.

                        You’re looking at the symptom and not the cause.  They cannot sell the ads at a high enough price because they don’t have the audience. The newspaper industry was not healthy when the internet came along.Sure, the internet would have hurt the industry at least a little had it been healthy when the internet came along. But it was already in free fall and bleeding readership and subscriptions.  I remember all the ridiculous excuses they made back then, primarily that people didn’t want to read.  No, they didn’t want to read progressive propaganda and pay for the privilege.Why is a newspaper company involved in cellular service? These are unrelated businesses.  What other industries involve having to be “diversified” into totally unrelated businesses to stay in business?  That’s more like 1 company subsidizing another via a parent company.  Like Bigbuscorp owns both a newspaper publisher and a cellular network.  The newspaper loses money, but the cellular company makes more money than the paper loses and so Bigbuscorp is still profitable.My local papers are The Daily News and Inquirer ({Philadelphia). I would read at least one if they weren’t awful progressive rags. I would either get the paper delivered or use paid digital.  But I would rather be shot than give these people one red nickel.  They are actively hostile to me.  Plus, their papers are now so thin and so expensive that they wouldn’t be worth it even if they didn’t hate me (though, if they weren’t so radically racially progressive, they would likely have a better and bigger paper).When you come along and notice how badly the papers are doing, you are assuming it is inherent to the form, that it somehow must be this way.  But I believe if the papers were better, they would be in much better shape.  Colin Flaherty use to say, take the most progressive lunatic you have ever known, make it 10 times worse and that is the average editor/journalist in a newspaper.

My choice is being screeched at by off the charts liberals who mix in current events while doing their best to hide who actually did the crimes, etc or nothing. I’ve chosen the later.We had connections in the newspaper business for a while. Absolutely agree that it was on the decline before the Internet.

                            Their audience went to cable TV and to the internet. I have agreed several times with you that their model was already under pressure before the Internet. Their diversifications allowed them to stay in business longer than otherwise would have been possible. I offered you a local example of a company (Knight Ridder) that did nothing and went bust.

                                No they didn’t. Cable TV by its very nature is a national news service which, at its best, compliments a local news source.  It absolutely cannot replace a local newspaper.  TV news had been around for quite a while.  Cable didn’t even exist in Philly until like 1988.  The Philadelphia Bulletin went out of business in like 82. PNI is still around, AFAIK. Their papers (Inquirer and Daily News) certainly are.I ask you again, respectfully, what other business requires separate profitable businesses to prop up the other?  The example you gave was a newspaper company “diversifying” into a cellular network.  How does this leaverage the strength and capabilities of a newspaper organization?  In the limited information you gave, it just sounds to me like a profitable cellular business propped up an unprofitable newspaper.

            The news business model also changed from trying to make a profit with a wide viewership, to regime funding in return for supporting the narrative.  CNN or the NYT could have no viewers or subscribers, lose millions, and stay in business indefinitely.

                I know I’ve posted before about the regime laundering taxpayer funds into the msm, right out in the open, through MIC ad buys and pharma ad buys. It’s remarkable how few (if any) people question why Lockheed Martin, which sells zero consumer products, and whose only customers are governments, is advertising on tv.

            The media was already in its current state by the early 2000s and was already in consolidation.  I don’t think it was the internet that caused the collapse of the newspaper industry.  Remember, before internet really started catching on, they were blaming all their problems on the readers with ridiculous claims like people don’t want to read.  What really happened was SJWs took over the media.  This happened a long time ago.  Who the hell wants to pay for a paper to be lectured by SJWs?  Newspapers really started collapsing in the 80s.  They are less than half the size and 3 bucks a day at the newsstand.  Five bucks for the Sunday edition.

                Yes, on my old site I did an analysis of the daily circulation of the LA Times. It peaked in about 1985 and then started to decline. Long before the internet.
Hispanics don’t read papers and mostly don’t read. Book sales in Mexico are dwarfed by those in Finland, which has a much bigger translation and print barrier. Demographic changes alone would make readership decline, but …
SJW started in the 1980s and drove readers away even above demographic decline.

Yes, that jibes with what I’ve seen on my two visits to Mexico. Bookshops are few and far between, and often it’s difficult to even find a place to buy a newspaper.

            The decline in newspaper journalism antedates the internet. “Two newspaper towns” were disappearing in the 1980s as television “journalism” was ascendant.Along with the emphasis on televised journalism came the feminization of journalism. In a visual media it is far more important to be good-looking than inquisitive or smart. Women are the ultimate go-along-with the crowd animals, completely a different species than the ugly, H.L. Mencken-type misanthropes and cynics who populated print journalism in the early-to mid- 20th century, sustaining themselves almost entirely on coffee and cigarettes.There is no such thing as “in-depth” reporting on television, it is all sound-bite oriented and ratings-driven.

                True, but the loss of advertising to the internet and classified ads to Craigslist was devastating. But, yes, television, especially cable TV like CNN was already hitting the newspapers hard.

                    Since you mention loss of ad revenue, there is at least a partial reason for this.  Waay long ago the (progressive) newspapers here began to censor ad’s.  For example, none could be placed for (legal) firearms transactions.  There were other “social ills” that would not be accommodated as well.  They were so adamant, that the morning paper which owned the printing presses used by the afternoon, conservative paper insisted they would not print the afternoon paper if it contained the forbidden ad’s.
It was then I let my subscription lapse.

                Absolutely. The inflation of the 70s and the spike in paper costs hurt them severely. Some of them even bought stakes in paper mills and got screwed doubly when paper prices collapsed in the early 80s. But I agree with Citizen that the classified losses were the nail in the coffin.

                    Classified ads were pretty inexpensive.  I sold a few cars on classifieds and they were like 15-20 bucks for a few days.  Aside from the full, half and quarter page ads, the big money maker was probably help wanted.  The first time I was involved in hiring someone, I was shocked at the price. It was hundreds of Dollars.

            This tracks with the resentment of Keir Starmer. He hit up some rich people for a couple of hundred thousand for new clothes. Apparently he felt he needed that. Even though he’d be a regime capo for years, brushing Rotherham under the rug years ago.FWIW Elon Musk is at war with Starmer and Labor. He’s funding Farage, blasting Starmer and his minions over Rotherham, which has errupted again, and has called for regime change there, and in Germany also (backing the AfD presumably to save his Tesla plants in Germany).Maybe Labor should not have picked a fight with the world’s richest man before the election on the view that Bad Orange Man would be destroyed by Cool Diverse Wine Aunt. [Labor MPs are “summoning” Musk to testify about X moderation policies and have threated to arrest him via extradition warrant.]

        Seeking truth is always the last casualty of unbridled decadence…
‘Fate of Empires’ by SirJohn Glubbp.20“Decadence is a moral and spiritual disease, resulting from too long a period of wealth and power, producing cynicism, decline of religion, pessimism and frivolity. The citizens of such a nation will no longer make an effort to save themselves, because they are not convinced that anything in life is worth saving.”

                    The typical estimate is a decrease of 2-3 points per decade decline or a generational move of about 10 points (25 years per generation).  Now if the  typical IA comes across the border with an 80-85 IQ…it might seem not like much, but it will skew the curve quite a bit to the low end.

                Which is pretty incredible considering that the guy was a convicted felon. I’m not military but I have relatives who are, I’ve been to Ft. Bragg (or Ft. Fagg or whatever they call it now) and a number of other installations. Bragg had pretty tight security compared to others. It was armed contract security, but you had to sign in, tell them where you were going and what authorized personnel you were with, scan your “Real ID,” potentially submit to a vehicle search, etc. etc. I got the definite impression these guys weren’t fucking around and if anything was out of order you’d be in deep shit.

                    No one and no vehicle is getting on base without ID and a sticker on said vehicle. After 9/11 these rules were put in place and strictly enforced. ‘Strictly enforced’ means they will shoot your ass if you try to rush the base, end of story.
So, if it is true that he was on base that many times, he was allowed to be. Of course, we will never definitively know if he was on base or not for the reasons Zman states above.

                Ryan Routh’s ex-wife, who he claims bankrolled his trips to Ukraine, etc., works for a security contractor located not far from her former CIA employer in Langley, Virginia. Cell phone tracking data shows someone who regularly visited Thomas Crooks’ home and work also frequented a building in Washington, DC where an FBI office is located. It should hardly surprise anyone to find connections of such to the military, as well. So many coincidences!

            Probably got an MK unit at Bragg.  Bragg’s one of the biggest military installations on the planet.
There are a number of military production facilities for manchurian candidates across America.  It’s a well-honed program by this time.

        I dunno if we’re missing anything with the death of the media or not, Z. In today’s day and age it seems to me that ignorance is pretty much a deliberate choice with people in the triple digit IQ range.i was there during the Golden Age Of Journalism and honestly…it wasn’t that great. Back in the day they wrote at a grade 7 level in order to be understood by the common dirt people. Politics were reported at a grade level one or two years lower. Consider the political cartoons of the time…every second meme-wank or shit poaster on Blab can blow those old pundits and cartoonists out of the water.Mind you… I’m a retired old fart. I have the time to type in the search bar, “Why does Putler want the Ukraine” and 10 or 15 hours later I’ll have a fairly solid understanding of the conflict, and 40 hours later I’ll be an expert – at least compared to the average Joe or media slob. For you young ones it’s much different: you have jobs, families, commitments and schedules… and a 40 hour deep dive on current events might not be possible.But from my vantage point… I’m glad the media is dead.

            Reporters of old didn’t need to be well educated.  They followed a template to convey actual events.  Hemingway started as a reporter, which is why his writing is so succinct.  Today’s reporters are much better writers, but they no longer convey the truth.

                They aren’t better writers either. The typos are off the charts without proof readers. School educations back in the day were much more rigorous. Modern college graduates, who probably could not make it through senior level high school back in the day, just like the idea that they are writers. That sort of writing is easily the worst type of material to read.

            To add to your point, journalism was only seen as respectable sort of profession post WWII. I recommend to anyone watching the movie His Girl Friday for a very dark view of the newspaper business before WWII. The “happy” ending kind of was it appeared that a pair of married news junkies got back to together.In movie The Philadelphia Story, the happy ending afforded to the “B story” was two people getting out of the newspaper business to do something real.My husband recounted a tale of working in IT right before the death of the local newsroom. It involved being disgusted by reporters who cheerfully hoped for a “big accident” of an event that had just come over the scanner. News reporting only seems respectable/good if you’re just reading the finished product.

                Recommend the one with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell.  Best part (for purposes of this discussion) is the scene where each reporter is phoning in his version of the “story” that just broke full of ridiculous exaggerations.

        What Z describes is the consolidation of a unitary power structure. The components of the Power Structure are the media, academia, corporations, Hollywood and FedGov. As Z notes, in the bygone years, there was usually some degree of distrust and antagonism between those components. Now they function as a Hydra whose sole purpose is to advance an agenda. The twin fulcrums of that agenda are rank greed and anti-white racism.

            It’s not quite anti-White racism specifically. I would call it greed and the wish to live forever while hating HBD. The PTB don’t like Japan or even the Chinese anymore than us. We see the ant-white angle of transhumanism for obvious reasons.

                Maybe – but the PTB can’t do much about China, and only to a lesser extent can they do much to Japan.  Neither of those have the same immigration death wish that plagues the West.  Because they have more access to the West, they focus their efforts on us.

                    “Neither of those have the same immigration death wish that plagues the West. Because they have more access to the West, they focus their efforts on us.” – The US specifically has been settled recently so it’s harder to justify stopping the party. However, at no time has open borders ever been popular with any native population. Only one or two generations, brainwashed by their TVs and schools, even thought it was a good idea.We are going to feel it more because it’s directed to us. We maybe even be more of their efforts overall. We not all of them though.  They are just as bent on erasing Japan and China too. As I explained on a different post, UBISoft race swapped their protagonist in their upcoming Assasin’s Creed in feudal Japan. There’s reasons to believe their last Prime Minister was conveniently removed for possibly having nationalistic ideas. Part of the reason we’re all supposed to hate the Chinese now is because they’ve in essence out jewed Jews. Xi became a stumbling block to relocation of transhumanist headquarters. If given a chance they would absolutely (and have been) doing to China what they did here.

                            I think I need to clarify a bit. Assassins’ Creed is an older video game line that has prided itself on letting people go on military type missions in historical eras. At one point they were marketing to schools for history lessons. The newest Assassin Creed video game, which is scheduled to be released in February, is supposed set in feudal Japan where people will play as a samurai.And UbiSoft, the maker, decided to go ahead and make the main playable “samurai” a black man.   So yesreally, a huge muscular black man will be in dubious position relative to the computer generated Japanese villagers in video game. A historically accurate game would never have a white man in the role.I will give you unhinged adoration of the Hutu. That is certainly clear. However, they’re erasing Japanese men to express it in this case. It’s not just us here that the globalist hate. That shouldn’t either be a surprise or discouraging. Them hating humanity in general (minus their Hutu worship, and that is more like a golden calf) means we should able to find some friends.

                                    “One guy in a video game doesn’t connote generalized hatred for the Japs. ”The outcry in Japan was huge, something UbiSoft should have anticipated. Japanese gamers, of which there were many, had wanted to play themselves, not a ghetto guy in samurai outfit. They even “ghettoized” the sound track (really!). Anyone with any working brain cells should have known that would be a big deal and highly disrespectful to Japanese history and culture. Apparently there was even talk of the government getting involved, it was that big of an event. It’s been suspended for now because the video game has not been released. I doubt they have the time or the will though to redo that crazy decision.Meanwhile, you and I also have the problem of selection bias. We’re largely reading in English about things that impact us. We do know that wherever the CIA goes, it’s rainbow flag time. That necessarily includes their racial agenda. We don’t really know what they do to try to degrade other cultures all that much. We can think it’s all about us because we’re not getting much information on what’s happening in other places.Again, they don’t have to hate us alone the PTB to be evil or be a problem. We are worth the saving because God created us. Evil people hating us only hardly makes us special, nor do I need their validation on the point.

                                        Where do you suppose the Power Structure stands on the matter of America dropping A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? How about internment of Japanese-Americans in WWII?In case you don’t know, I’ll tell you. The PS claims racism with an undercurrent of genocide motivated both actions. Total bullshit, of course, but that’s their narrative. And it’s their narrative because in the eyes of the PS, white people can do no right, and we are at the very bottom of their racial hierarchy. Now the PS may be ambivalent about the Japs because they appear to be white-adjacent. But the key to that compound adjective is white. If the PS takes a dim view of some non-white people, it is because they behave too much like whitey. Obliteraing whiteness, hating the white race–this is the mainspring of their ideology.

                            Broadly, men of all ages and demographics. Video games have movie demographics and a larger audience modernly. If we want the largest demographic in the West, it is the 13-55 White male one.Video games have been crashing the last several years thanks to “diversity” pushes into the game that make them boring and unattractive to play. A movie is just 2 hours of interaction. Big video games take days to complete.

                That coalescence was certainly symptomatic. However, I think the real root was the takeover of academia by the postmodern Left, which then used the professorate to indoctrinate Leftist change-agents who went thither into the media, Hollywood, big bidniss and FedGov, where they multiplied like the rats and cockroaches they are.

        We used to have a wide swath of people who were “news buffs” meaning they read up on current events and could opine on them. This was the mark of an educated or successful person. You see this with Boomers…they still watch and read mainstream sources because for most of their life, it was legitimate information, much of it borne from guys with a “nose for news”, plus veteran court house and city hall scribes, cynical, modestly paid, and often drunk. Grizzled war correspondents for the international stuff. In short, there were many people who liked to write about the human condition rather than regurgitating press releases and vying for access.But that is a dead industry. I look around and see many of these same people reporting on the human condition, just not for mainstream sources. In a different age, Morgoth should be writing for the Telegraph. Zman for the Washington Post. But they won’t, but can be found elsewhere. So we have a “horizontal world” still, just in new media. Which is fine by me. The only downside is Zman will never be as widely read as Mike Royko.

            So true.  There used to be a bar across from my city’s major newspaper.  The reporters who hung out there were middle class common men getting drunk and mingling with their customers.  Today’s reporters go to private cocktail parties and never interact with anyone but each other.

        Add to this the fact that search engines intentionally divert people to desired sources and they conceal undesired sources. You have to be exceptionally good at web searches, and extraordinarily patient scrolling through the first 15 pages of results, to find something that isn’t state-approved.in the last couple of years I’ve also noticed the problem of repeating search results. You get a page or two in, and Google just starts re-showing you the first page of results.Where the web really shines is places where you can learn how to do things. I fix tons of stuff now that I would probably have just paid to have done 10 years ago. Product manuals are often gibberish written by non native English speakers. So, being able to tune in to a channel where a guy simply films himself changing the oil on his Cub Cadet (right down to the correct filter and hacks to make it easier) is very helpful. I’ve learned a lot of great hacks this way. I replaced the belt on my treadmill after watching a guy do it, then ordering the parts. The motor was still good and it saved me $2K for a new machine.The review bots haven’t figured out how to fake a real reviewer who uploaded photos of their happiness or unhappiness with products/services. So I benefit from others’ experiences in ways I wouldn’t have before.What we call “news” has always been a lie. To the extent I read or watch it, I focus on what happened and then I skip the “why” explanations. I’ll make up my own mind. That guy in Vegas struck me as a suicide. Once I heard he was Army 10th Special Forces Group, my first thought was “suicide” followed by “probably a broken marriage”. I know a few of those guys because of where I live and they are a complete mess emotionally, spiritually, and physically. Broken families are the norm. What did we learn today? He and his wife had a spat on Christmas because he cheated on her (so she claims). Could be the other way around, and probably is. He was deployed. Military wives hit the bars the instant the boat leaves port or the landing gear goes up.I trust my own instincts.Anyway, we’re as dumb as we always were when it comes to “the news”. But we’re quite a bit smarter when we use the web to learn how to do something.Journalists are rapidly becoming a joke.

                We’ll never know. We never do.
I’m not sure if it’s a strategy or an effect incidental to some other aim, but the narrative template of the everyday reportorial news is “unresolved cliffhanger.” They show us an event or phenomenon, in a blur of contradiction and lies and political hectoring, and follow it with…nothing.
“Did we ever find out what happened with [____]?” We did not.

                Seems extravagant and the wife said he was home Christmas Day.People are weird and suicide is a wildly irrational and emotional act.  If his wife is a shitlib, as some are reporting due to her anti-Trump Facebook posts, in his warped mind dying in a blaze of fireworks glory at Trump’s hotel in a Tesla (instead of at home with her) could very well been his way of saying where his true loyalties were. ie not herThe guy in NOLA strikes me as a garden variety “Maj Hassan” type.  Once they get radicalized, they quickly go critical and decide to take a lot of people with them.

                    I read the Tesla attack at Trump’s hotel the opposite way. It’s a way of showing disapproval of both Trump and Musk while going out in a blaze of glory. It was quite clever really. If the guy really was in Ukraine, he may have felt that Trump’s desire to end the war quickly was a betrayal of his “mission” there, sort of the way Vietnam vets often felt that the politicians “didn’t let us win” in Vietnam.

                        I agree, it could go either way.  The regime has to be careful because if he was one of the many US combat troops fighting illegally in Ukraine, they may not want to admit this to the public…such as if he put that in a suicide note.  “I fought side by side with Ukrainians and we can’t abandon them!” that sort of thing.The other thought I has due to the Tesla connection is he could have been making some crazy point about the H1B problem.But in general, I agree you could be right about it.  The fact that it’s almost certainly a suicide given the timeline of the rental, his stops at charging stations, then arriving at Vegas and using what were probably illegal fireworks bought along the way, means any nutty reason is possible.  People often do weird inexplicable shit once they decide to kill themselves.

                        There’s a podcaster saying he got an email from the Vegas guy claiming it’s really about a cover up of some crazy gravimetric propulsion arms race with China and drones, and that he was actually on the run from the CIA. The FBI apparently thinks the email was from the Vegas guy.
So there’s something for everyone. A crazy questionable suicide, marital infidelity, fireworks, powerful handguns, a cyber truck, and links to UAP’s and alien technology.

But it was built by lazy American white men and jocks and assorted prom queens, so infinity H1B Pajeets are indicated. To save us from our Bad White selves.

                The suicide epidemic in the military is very bad.  I should clarify to say that my first thought was suicide once I heard he was in the Army 10th SFG.  Prior to that, I was like everyone else wondering if it was related to the NOLA attack despite it being a fairly harmless explosion in comparison.

            I wouldn’t be so sure about that.  A couple things:1) Propaganda can create motivated soldiers, especially out of normies.2) Things can change quickly, and people can get riled up fast.3) Technology can enable mass violence without the need for personal bravery (drones) – an abomination, but a fact nonetheless.

        This is why I come to websites such as the Zblog – the national media is nothing but garbage, peddling governmental lies day in and day out.  I believe nothing that comes from either of them.  Unfortunately, many people I interact with unquestioningly lap up the crap – really amazing, the lack of critical thinking.  However, I will admit to watching the local news for the going’s on in town and the weather – that I’ll typically buy.

        The media has largely been replaced by people who talk about the news, not generate it.  We used to call these people talking heads.  All of the “independent media” people are always talking about are not in fact independent media, they’re talking heads.In my mind, the guy reporting from the scene of an accident or fire or a crime, whether in front of a camera or a typewriter is the media.  An investigative reporter is also, in my mind, the media.Far too much is national or even international.  A British newspaper has a story about a “polar vortex” settling in on a large part of the US.  I saw it on Google News.  Why the hell is a British newspaper reporting the weather in the US?  My city has 2 newspapers with fairly poor local coverage, most being filler material.  Both are of course, radically progressive.  It’s not uncommon today to find corporate or government press releases printed verbatim by the media.Most of the English language media is propaganda.  I mean that in the true sense of the word.  It’s reported in a narrative form with lots of emotional manipulation and extremely one sided.

In that, the generations that abandon the “news” will be happier and probably better informed about the world.

        The national outlets and local outlets experienced consolidation of ownership simultaneously. There is no independent local station left, nor will a new one be permitted. They are now all part of corporate conglomerates, controlled from the top.Concurrently, the process through which new “reporters” were curated became more refined. The national outlets mostly hire from the same few “journalism” schools which are the most pozzed examples of a nationally pozzed institution. These pozzed schools self select for the type of “talent” that is being sought. For the national outlets, you aren’t getting anybody who isn’t a trust fund baby from an Ivy league institution. Percentage who aren’t wokebot npc = zero. They arrive for employment fully indoctrinated and not requiring any direction from above to stay “on message,” nor to refrain from asking uncomfortable questions. They’ve already learned not to do that, similar to your jab taking npc friends and family members.None of this happened overnight. The consolidation of ownership and the refinement of the curation process played out over the last several decades. In my youth, in the 1980s, the media was somewhat corrupt and had its famous “liberal bias,” but the above process had just begun, so there was still some reporting going on. Slowly but surely, over the next 30-40 years, we got here.Compounding the problem is a majority stupid population that doesn’t read. Thus they are just as vulnerable to propaganda through internet videos as they are through more traditional television screens. Propaganda being more effective in video form. The rest of us, not exactly the same 30% who refused the jab but probably a similar percentage overall, get to complain about it in places like this.The majority was probably always stupid, it seems to be an unfortunate fact of life, but once upon a time they had leadership who didn’t actively hate them and didn’t deliberately mislead them (as much), so things weren’t quite so bad.

People quite often come up with wild theories about how the modern media has all the same message. It’s only as complex as a school of fish swimming together. They all turn some new direction seemingly all at once and who knows why. But each fish has volunteered to stay with the group direction.

        A quibble on journalism, media ownership consolidation was happening before news consumption started to shift online. Gannett had bought up a big chunk of the newspaper industry by the early 90s and local TV stations stopped being locally owned around the same time.  They were already pushing conformity in reporting and closing off promoting routes to people who didn’t do it their way by the time the internet boom happened.Also the pay at lower level newspaper and TV stations is comically low. It self selects for either low quality reporters or people with delusions of grandeur. What do you expect from someone who goes to college for four years and takes a job as the weekend anchor in Lubbock, Texas for $15 an hour?

            Barnard- Important points you’ve made.  The gobbling up of newspapers by Gannett, Knight-Ridder (later purchased by McClatchy), along with the new law allowing unrestricted ownership of radio stations in the 90s struck a blow to independent voices.
A friend’s daughter is in the reporting business.  She has moved up from small market to mid-market and is now a reporter for one of the major network affiliates in Chicago.  Besides having a somewhat gregarious personality, she’s just a run-of-the-mill, left-leaning person in real life. Conforms well to the TV news culture.

                A major side effect of unrestricted ownership of radio stations was the death of rock &amp; roll.  Creative musicians could lobby local radio stations to play their music, and hope it caught a wave across the country.  What gets airtime now is generic crap decided by corporate committees.

        Journalism and media once consisted of LMC and LC men who tended towards swearing and drinking.  But they could investigate and write.  Being adversarial (with everybody, including your editor) was prerequisite to the gig.Occasionally a Dorothy Kilgallen would come along, and room was made for exception-by-merit.  Females were not a Protected Class back then.Journalism and the media now are upwardly mobile MC and UMC women, largely.  Corporate spokes-faces typically are women, because implicitly we TRUST MOM, hmm?  I mean, MOM wouldn’t lie!As you write, instead of working-class, journalists now are part of the sub-elite (or ‘management’) and their relationship with the Corporate Hive is mutualistic.  Congress largely rubber-stamps corporate policy.  The feminine is collectivist — herdish — by nature.  She’s perfect for the times.  The elite lurve them some future is female.

            From twitter, re the Paki rape gangs controversy:“We have to face the dark truth….women can not be trusted with positions of power. I don’t think they do it on purpose, but it’s clear that their inclination to follow groupthink and compete for “empathy status” makes them bring disastrous consequences onto our society.”Some Guardian twit named “Ella Cockbain” is claiming “studies show ‘Paki grooming gangs’ is a far right stereotype”, because Elon is castigating Starmer for the coverup when Kier was head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) from 2008 to 2013.Men compete, women trash other women. (Ella versus the victims)ps- hat tip for Dorothy Kilgallen, death (and burial!) by JFK investigation.

                Ella Cockbane.  :O)  And they say God has no sense of humor.Placing women in positions of power, and subjugating men to women, is the big cosmic no-no that leads to nasty, cold doomage.The State, schools, colleges, LE, corporations, media and courts love feminism, effecting a massive and on-going transfer of wealth from males to females and to the above-named interests.The dads of daughters love feminism because largely it absolves them of their traditional responsibilities towards their daughters, including preparing her for marriage (NOT for career) at a young age, combing through potential suitors, and handing her over — completely — to her husband for life, to live under HIS headship, as God intended.Now, no need for all that trouble!  The State, corporations, courts etc. ALL are the husbands of daughter, and assume dad’s traditional responsibilities.  Don’t need no husband with that fat set-up!The massive incentives offered to parents of daughters makes it very difficult for them to set her on a traditional path, one that might please God.  That choice means they must then swim against all of society.

        I think some important things are being missed.People are adapting to the lack of real news by seeking it on X, on Rumble, on Substack, all having an end-run around the lack of real news on the MSM. People want/need real news because society is no longer stable and old rules no longer apply. Simply something as mundane as the bird flu being the excuse for eggs to be both scarce and now $12 a dozen in my local Supermarket (Stater Brothers) alllows those who know its coming to stock up and maybe get some chickens for eggsBig Shots are being threatened by mass third world immigration and are reacting.Elon Musk has backtracked after he realized, no he would not be hiring $40K engineers for Space X as they would not cut it. No doubt senior technical managers had some input there as well. He knows Vivek is not his buddy, and the business model of Zuck is way off of his. Zuck wants cheap coders to do boilerplate stuff until he can AI automate that. You cannot apply that labor force to Space X, Tesla, or anything else Musk does.But Musk over the years seems afraid of the US and Western Europe being South Africanized. He’s wealthy — the world’s richest man. And a social worker was able to trans his kid over his objections. He knows mass third world immigration will create a President Julius Malema who will simply take all his stuff. And throw him in prision. At the minimum there will be no spending on anything but social welfare for non-White immigrants.Thats why he’s backing Farage in the UK and Tweeting that the Labor Minister belongs in prison over the Rotherham scandal. Its why he’s backing AfD as he has substantial German investments.There is a WAR on. It is between the owners (Musk, Bezos, Zuck to some extent, Bill Ackman, a few others) and the managerial State and its Titans: Obama, Pelosi, Fauci, Wray, Elizabeth Warren aka Liawatha.

        Until “AI” finishes its work, we can look at some old news and see what we’ve lost. It’s about as we remember, somewhat less dumb than today’s, slightly less dishonest, a little less crazy.Commentary wasmuchbetter, a profession of middle aged white men who knew things—how to lie intelligently, for example. And they were often funny. Remember? That’sgone. We get a good Tim Dillon or Sam Hyde video once in a while, but they’re just comedians. They’re very smart—observant—but they don’tknowanything. Our only guy who works in the style of our old newspaper columnists, Bronze Age Pervert, doesn’t even have a job. And you can ruin yourself by saying nice things about him, as Claremont did.Big Stories™, the ones reporters would retire on and become novelists, are all justmade upnow, rather than carefully falsified. Russiagate—winner of every prize, deformer of all media for years—was literallyno story. There was nothing to start it from, and nothing was ever found. The similar all-journalism-consuming Watergate was a gay op too, but it did have an inciting event—followed by others. Some people did do some things, and the news told us about a few of them, partly truthfully. We never get anything like that anymore.And the bottom has lost its local flavor, as you say. The telling case, I think: Drone and clown and fog scares that would have been local before, maybe brought wide retrospectively in a One Step Beyond or In Search Of… episode or something, are the same everywhere now. We’re on course for every town in the Anglosphere to share penis-stealing-witch hysterias with Zambia—not because the Zambians are here (they are), but becauseZambian media(metaphorical) is.And I’m not disgusted with the masses for not looking stuff up. I used to be, back when the internet worked, but that’s over. In a way it’s never beenlesspossible to find information. Publicly accessible libraries don’t even have books in them. (Go look.) And “tech” has hidden almost everything from all but the most obsessed. What they do let us find, they’ve so swamped in made up crap, we don’t even believe it. As we shouldn’t.We don’t start blank, but we can bemadeblank.

            On the news this morning, the reporter referred to it as “The Army base that used to be called Fort Bragg”.  I like the one I learned on this site today:  Fort Fagg.

        “The objective facts are often more readily available than in the prior age… With no institutional support in finding and assembling the facts…”It’s both betterandworse than before. More information is available but the incurious don’t seek it out. Re-installing the gatekeepers (‘institutional support’) won’t help. Thespikewas always used by legacy media to control the narrative. At least, now, there are parallel channels to circumvent the gates.The problem is more fundamental. As Derb quotes, “The faintest of all human passions is the love of truth.”The problem lies with liberal democracy, where convincing the masses is all-important.

        The informational narrowing extends to non-news sources. A few years back, I was researching a 19th Century historical couple for a work of historical fiction I was writing. Every online article about them contained essentially the same regurgitated information. Was that due to laziness, I wondered, or was the more interesting info all copyrighted? I did find references to a book, but unfortunately it was out of print and thus too expensive for me to order.

            This is why I find the archive.org project to be useful. Researching topics from the past seems to have become impossible when relying on standard internet searches. Reading scanned books, long out of print and impossible to find, is usually very valuable. That being said I have no way of knowing if AI is somehow altering the original text in sinister ways.

        Two instances of ignorance come to mind:  The Las Vegas shooting, and the Benghazi debacle.  Everything went silent about the Vegas shooting just when is started getting weird and interesting.  Now it’s off the radar except for kooks like the one I heard recently saying it was commandos in helicopters doing the shooting.Why no military help/air support arrived to assist the beleaguered folks at Benghazi is still a mystery.  There is rumor the Admiral who wanted to help got cashiered.  Weird and interesting, but no one in the media seems to care.“At this point, what difference does it make?” seems a fitting motto for the mass media.

            The list of “weird” events that have gone silent, with no probable hope of resolution/justice/truth within the last 10 years:-Epstein murder-Shooting of democrat whistler blower (Seth somebody)-Las Vegas shooting (felt bad for the local law enforcement when I saw on camera)-Benghazi-Bombing of Lebanese port-Blowing up a TN Internet hub from the outside-Recent murder of health care executive (that was an insult to everyone’s intelligence. I hope the video game character got paid enough to be a patsy. )-Every single event involving a Muslim or POCIt’s gotten so bad that hardly want to know the news.

        “…despite having access to the great data stream.”
That “great data stream” is mostly garbage, just dross. If you want real information, real analysis, you have to pay for it. Ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. I think Orlov described it some years back as just garbage moving at the speed of light. In Neal Stephenson’s sci-fi novel, “Fall”, what’s available to the proles is just advertising, propaganda, and disinformation. The good stuff is either behind paywalls or you need substack subscriptions. To read Taibbi, Hersh, or Tooze, you have to pay.

        I hate to completely disagree, but here it goes. In the 2000’s during the Iraq adventure I began following Michael Yon’s reporting. On the ground rational informative reporting. Convinced the old man to follow along. The old man said he wished he had this kind of information during the Vietnam era. I get more information on the Ukrainian War than my grandfather EVER got about WWII. Within minutes of the attack on Bourbon Street I knew the Mohammedan was flying the freak flag of ISIS. Corporate media may not be interested in Epstein, but there’s not a soul in this country that doesn’t know. Journalism may be dead, but access to information ain’t.

        “Today, every journalism student imagines herself as part of the ruling class and one day she will do her part to further the mission of the ruling class”Even more apt is that they are all now immigrants or members of a group that has always defined itself in opposition to Westernkind and Our civilization. Given that The Regime’s ultimate goal is the destruction of these things they are already furthering the mission of the ruling class.It is kind of like the big thing that has been revealed by this Musk/King-Cobra fiasco. It isn’t just non-White immigrants who are problematic. Thiel and Musk are also immigrants with no loyalty and no connection to wherever they set up shop. Just like The Regime has its filtering mechanism, namely being opposed to Westernkind and Our civilization, we need ours. Are you connected, and deeply connected, to Our soil and Our heritage? Have you demonstrated that connection through action?J.D. Vance and his fancy words come to mind. In any case, just making some connections here.

        Worth noting that newspapers made a huge chunk of their money from classified ads which the Internet has completely looted.  Historically no consumer has ever (*ever*) paid what it costs to generate actual news so there was no way to make up that gap in funding.

            Good point, the revenue was always heavily weighted to advertising, not the loose change people paid for the paper. The news reporting industry has been flawed since its inception, the people who chose to work for it have never been noble truth tellers. A reporter who would give honest treatment to any story no matter who was impacted was about as real as a unicorn.

            Also, the dirty secret of newspapers for many years was that the sports section sold the newspaper. The “real” journalists in the news section didn’t like admitting this. Today, when you can get sports scores, stats, and highlights on your phone, why bother with papers? Before the interwebs and sail foams, the advent of 24 hr sports television also cut into this.

                    Beginning at the age of 11, and continuing to roughly the age of 33, one of my greatest pleasures was plumping down on the couch with a mug of black coffee and the sports page of a Sunday morning, and reading about college football. As I got older in that period, I also began to savor the Op/Ed page, where my ox would assuredly be gored, and I’d have to dash of an incendiary Letter to the Editor.

        Technology has also made journalism a profession for lazy people and the local tv news business has become a Ford assembly line with multiple newscasts to fill for the day.Its easy for producers to cut and paste stories from one newscast to another, a litte edit change, a little spice and the same story appears again in the next newscast filling the time required by the news beast and giving more avails for shady lawyers and car salesmen to buy.Another problem is young people do not watch a lot of local news so in past ages a newspaper reporter hound would get a front page story published about a local issue or corruption in local government, that newspaper reporter no longer exists and the young people are on Tic Toc or checking the sports betting sites.Uncle Ted was not wrong.

        The result of this is we now live in an age of ignorance.This is so, so very true and a great line and observation. It almost offsets this howler:Instead of gathering up the available facts to understand what is happening, people just trust the news.Objectively people don’t trust the news at all and long ago tuned it out. It really isn’t a matter of distrust, either, but total indifference. People in this sphere ridicule Normie and Grillers, and mostly rightfully so, but in one respect they are far more rational than we. They are apathetic because it is the proper response to date. That will change, and might have but/for some recent changes, but it is reasonable. The ignorance is reasonable.

        The great question of the Technocracy will be whether it is ultimately centralized or atomized. Mainframe or PC, to put it in 80s lingo. Centralization seems to have the upper hand at the moment, as it is most amenable to concentrated power, but there is nothing in theory preventing personal scale supercomputers, AI and robotic manufacturing.It would probably take a conscious societal value decision to decentralize, either quasi-religious like the Butlerian Jihad in the Dune backstory, or a hard learned aversion to networked computers like in Battlestar Galactica or the Terminator flicks. Maybe both.In any event, Technocracy will have its Discontents. From such, a new order may eventually arise.

        “…most people just want to be told what to think. Faced with the great firehose of information called the internet, most people simply find a narrative source to trust. Instead of gathering up the available facts to understand what is happening, people just trust the news.”I think what you have here is the lack of critical thinking on the part of the public coupled with a lack of ability to filter through all the information being thrown at them.  TV watching seems to address these two points.Thus it was always so.  When I was a child, we had the three big media and perhaps PBS.  Walter Cronkite told us all the news we needed to know.  PBS pioneered the opinion section of the media.  Now media is waay less reporting and almost all opinion.  It’s pure propaganda—choose your side.  Everything else said is “commentary”.

        News editor from “the old days” here and I think this column efficiently sums things up — The way I’ve often described the situation is that MSM news outlets now actively work to bury stories, not break them. How else can you explain the astounding lack of curiosity toward glaring issues such as Biden’s mental capacity and who is really making the White House decisions.The only point I might quibble with is that news owners and publishers would not see a bank or factory as a rival, they would see it as a potential advertiser. I was fortunate to work back when there was not such a blatant political and social agenda but these newspapers clearly were strongly pro-local business and economy.

            The very term news “outlet” kind of gives the game away. Outlet. A point through which something is released, implying control, implying that there is something that is not released, implying function as part of a system which controls the release (or retention) of a reservoir of some kind. A system that is implicitly hierarchically governed. An outlet by definition being a node in such a system and certainly not an independent entity.

        Good points – well made.
If it isn’t in the mass media, it “must be” trivial; if the mass media makes a fuss – it must be significant, and “everybody” talks about it – even in private.
It’s all sad and pathetic – but the manipulated masses seem pretty happy about it all.
This is what happens, inevitably, when there is nothing deeper or more significant in life than comfort, convenience; and passing the time as pleasantly as possible until a (hopefully) painless terminating annihilation.

Leaving the television off for the last twenty five years has been a blessing.  How much television can one consume about the death of Michael Jackson, Whitney Huston, George Floyd, Jimmy Carter…  Who cares?

        Been reading Neal Asher sci-fi novels for a while.  In his future universe there are no politicians, for-real benevolent AIs run the government.
When I first read one of his novels a decade ago, I was “hell no”.  Now… sounds good to me – particularly since his universe has an ungoverned frontier if you don’t like it.

            Heh. There’s a Bruce Sterling story, I think it’s called “The Bicycle Shop”, where an AI is caught on record ranting about the stupid Joe Biden-type politician speaking without his script: “Oh hell! Who let that idiot loose? Where’s his handlers? This is a disaster!”

        This is off topic but I found it important to share.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08wadxp9FnQ&amp;pp=ygUSa2FycCBkcnVja2VubWlsbGVyNot that around the 48 minute mark, he talks about targeting people. Effectively amongst all the talk of ethics and morals and, “Western Values”, he is essentially talking about the end of privacy and state sponsored terrorism.This isn’t coming it is here now. One thing I think is interesting is how embedded he is with another nation state. (https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-palantir-ceo-flies-company-board-to-israel-in-show-of-solidarity/) What is even more sickening is Druckenmiller. Note how he does his own narrative formation by telling the audience that we just took out one of the greatest bad guys in history. No mention of who took him out and who replaced him.How do we go from complaining about this stuff to just doing it ourselves? We need some sort of Homeland program to bring our to our redoubts, steep themselves in Our identity and make them fiercely loyal to our people and our causes. We need our own birth rite project.Okay. Well, if I disappear at any time, you’ll know my phone was blown up and me with it. Hopefully, they don’t take out my family with me.

        The decline of newspapers coincided with the decline of the middle class who were the main subscribers.  I still subscribe to the local big city paper (the only major paper left in town), mostly out of habit and to follow local sports (their editorial policy is establishment liberal). The subscription is not cheap but I can afford it and I understand that it would be a luxury for many. When the old guys like me who like to read and prefer a paper format are gone, the newspaper will doubtless go to an online only format and eventually disappear.
