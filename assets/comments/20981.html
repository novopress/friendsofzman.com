        Two things changed my viewing habits. In the early 2000‚Äôs, a world champion boxer bought the house next door. In 3 weeks, we were on the property line with drawn, loaded pistols. Never again would I engage in activity that would funnel money to the nagger class of leeches. The boxer eventually ended up spending 10 years in a federal prison for defrauding the government of moneys meant to support the refugees from the Katrina flooding in New Orleans. Could not have happened to a more deserving dindunuffin.Second, a bobcat began taking my hens. For two full months, I sat on the porch from 3:00 pm thru twilight, which varied from 7:30 thru 8:15. I lost the habit of watching the nightly news and came to enjoy sitting on the porch listening to the animals wind down after the day. I live in an extremely rural setting and I hear only animal sounds as the day ends.This change followed my retiring from the active workforce and helped me to settle myself and detach from the daily grind. My life is infinitely better for the changes.

                Bobcat isn‚Äôt protected wildlife? Kill the wrong animal and you can face several years in prison. I‚Äôm a cat person, but I can understand the need of a ‚Äúfarmer‚Äù to protect his livestock.

                    In my state they are classed as nuisance animals when they are taking livestock.  Nuisance animals can be taken if they are causing damage to your animals.  I looked it up before I acted.

                NAJALT alert:
A former very good friend, 10 years deceased, was just such an animal, except add cigarettes, cocaine, sportsball gambling, and weed to the mix.
True to form, he was a CPA, and loyal to his tribe.  But, he was more loyal to his addictions.
What did we have in common?  Sportsball fanaticism.
Thankfully, I had the wisdom and the stones to part company with him

                    You mentioned gambling.  That is a major driver for the love of sports, especially football.  I had a white collar friend who was more interested in chasing women and his boat than football.  Then he got into gambling and he could rattle off statistics of every obscure fullback in the NFL.

                            One of my first jobs out of high school was in a printing factory.  That place was chock full of coffee addicts. The company didn‚Äôt let them smoke inside the building ‚Äì so they‚Äôd drink coffee incessantly.  Mostly out of those crappy coffee vending machines they had back then.It was just another substance abused by addicts was my view of the whole thing.  Coffee cups all over the floor ‚Äì puddles of coffee on the control panels of machines, etc.,  not already being a coffee drinker ‚Äì it just gave me a bad visual of who coffee drinkers were.And this was long before Starbucks or any of the fashionable coffee barista BS we‚Äôve been inundated with over the last couple of decades.I guess I could sum it up simply by saying that I found cigarettes so offensive as a child having to suck on the fumes ‚Äì that I never had the urge to smoke.  And I found the slovenly habits of all the coffee drinkers I was exposed to ‚Äì that I never felt the urge to drink coffee.  Likewise the lousy personal habits of gamblers steered me away from that as well. The types of people I met as a youngster who were avowed lefties ‚Äì made me veer hard right to avoid that road too.Hmmmm ‚Äì if these are types of people that engage in this behavior ‚Äì it‚Äôs probably a bad idea‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

                                I‚Äôve always found tobacco nasty to behold and so like you I never had the urge to try it.
Without coffee, however, I transform into a feral beast. Beware. I‚Äôve got my eyes on the anti-coffeans. All hail to the roasted bean.

                        Cigarettes, cocaine, drinking, and gambling have never been an issue for me.Weed and sportsball fanaticism have been.Between the two, the latter has been more difficult to shed.  Over a period of 5-6 years, I gradually weaned myself from MJ and have been completely free of it for 21 months.Sportsball, OTOH, has been much more of a challenge.In my case, for 20 years, I patronized the NFL, MLB, and college football by taking sportsball road trips courtesy of companies like Major League Vacations.  I had to see the Big House and be part of a crowd of 100,000; I had to see both the old and the new Mile High Stadium; I had to be in South Bend and see a game with touchdown Jesus in the background;  I had to sweat my ass off in Sun Devil Stadium; I had to see Three Rivers and Big Ben at Heinz; I had to see the Silverdome; I had to be part of the world‚Äôs largest outdoor cocktail party; and I just had to put my feet on the frozen tundra in late September.The good news is that it has now been four years since I have parted with a kopeck for sportsball tickets.  Likewise, it has been four years since I have attended any sportsball event.During the last 4 years, my sportsball interest has gradually tapered off and now, this year, finally, I have resolved to make a hard, clean break.

                                Yes, they were independent coffee shops nestled away in mountain towns and/or somewhat rural areas. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve noticed some dreadful changes among many of them over the last couple of years which has led me to quit visiting a couple all together. New ownership at one of the coffee shops were overtly hard-Left and their ideologies trickled down to the staff and within the overall environment. Another shop started to hire openly LGBTs and vocal SJWs. Some of the others remain OK, but the customer base has shifted to a far-more Marxist crowd than in previous years when there was a strong sense of normalcy among the patrons. This appears to be a trend with many of the independent coffee shops and I‚Äôm not talking about inter-city joints that cater to hipsters.

            There‚Äôs a lot of truth to this. I‚Äôve spent much of my adult life around high-performance individuals who have a higher expectation of what life should be. Many of these individuals were extreme athletes as I‚Äôve competed and embarked on many of adventures with them. Further, these people weren‚Äôt only world-class athletes, but they were also highly accomplished in every aspect of their lives ‚Äî from education to professional endeavors. Most would openly mock people who watched TV or immersed themselves in frivolous twaddle such as sportsball.

        I had a random discussion with a colleague today who I had not seen in quite awhile due to the lockdowns.  I was moving a bunch of heavy items so I was walking around without my mandatory face diaper because it‚Äôs hard to breathe dragging around a 300lb cart.  Anyway, she didn‚Äôt mind and asked me what I thought about the masks.  We agree they‚Äôre pretty stupid and that to the extent people bother wearing them it‚Äôs mainly out of a sense of politeness.  (I‚Äôve seen octogenarians at the grocery store look at me with stark raving mad terror for walking through the produce aisle without one.  No joke, the Government and Media have done an exceptional job terrifying those with low mental acuity and poor critical thinking skills.)Anyway, the discussion progressed to looking at the positives of all this.  And the one I increasingly hear (from her and many of my friends) is how much free time people have now.  I don‚Äôt mean if they‚Äôre out of work and terrified about making ends meet.  I‚Äôm talking about people who either are in jobs that are deemed essential, or jobs that have been able to keep running remotely, or maybe their business got back on its feet quickly after the lockdowns started getting lifted.During the lockdowns they started dumping things from their budget that were not essential.  Eating out, for example.  Or, their kids are in a multitude of ‚Äúactivities‚Äù and those memberships have been canceled or suspended.  Church is less busy for the church-going volunteers as for the first time in my 50 years summer Bible School was canceled, less choir practices, less other stuff.  I‚Äôm not saying any of these things are inherently bad.  The Church activities are very good and build community.  But the STRESS of these many activities just tears you apart.My family looked at our finances and decided if dark days are coming we‚Äôre best off owning our house.  Money does you no good in a bank account that the government can seize, but it‚Äôs harder to take property at least for now.  Pay off the house, kill the debt to the bank, free up cash flow.  I‚Äôve read that Americans spent a lot of their money during the lockdowns paying off debt and building savings.  That‚Äôs great!More people are cooking at home.  More people are having dinners as a family.  If you‚Äôre able to work, about 87% of the country is employed, more people are literally worried about absolutely nothing at all on Saturday.You can over-do it, of course, and that‚Äôs where boredom sets in.  But a lot of people found a new hobby which is less expensive and more fulfilling.  Hell, I can go on Kroger‚Äôs website, order my groceries for a 4-5pm pick up window, drive over there and wait, and they‚Äôll BRING IT OUT TO ME!!!  How awesome is that?  I hate going to the grocery store.  Now I spend less.  In terms of sports, like a lot of you, I started pulling away from that back in 2017 along with dumping cable.I think the economy will adapt to this new, slower, model.  Everyone isn‚Äôt quitting everything, but everyone is quitting something.  They‚Äôre slowing down.My mom jokes that we‚Äôre going to see two things in January: babies and divorces.  Spending more time around people in your house has pluses and minuses.Years ago, my brother had some serious mental health issues that really forced him to massively cut back on his lifestyle choices.  He was amazed at how happy his life became when he simplified.  Now, expand this across society.We talked in the hallway for about 10 minutes and went on with our workdays.We‚Äôre not in the end times.  Those who hate us most have much more to lose than we do.

            Good on them.Why risk flu+ on top of injury to entertain people?Frankly the NFL is a world of hurt anyway. We can keep the economy sort of alive in a a zombie mode by massive money printing but the entire edifice is going to decline 50%. or moreEven if/when we get a handle on the virus or get our heads out of our asses policy wise, the economic shrinkage is still going to be permanent  since most of the economy is superfluous.The effects of what will be 50% plus unemployment and underemployment are unknown to us but social dissolution is certainly possibleThe Feds will certainly try to maintain control but its very possible the US has now entered Brazil 2 territory and that every level of government will become less capable of anything.Support your local gang or better, bet that gang till you can make the nation you want.

For the huuuge paychecks. The flu isn‚Äôt a serious risk to them.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm all in favor of the death of sportsball. My post was just about the ridiculous fear of the Chinese Flue that people buy into.

        In my sportsball addiction days, I loved reading the newspaper sports columnists. The suspense would build just before the game, then you eagerly bought the Sunday paper to read the Homeric tale of how your team won or lost, and what was ahead. Or how your team exacted revenge for a past loss. Then the cycle would begin again on Monday, rising to a crescendo of anecdotes, innuendo, and injury reports creating fan anxiety. What a multicultural clown car I finally exited.

            I remember my brother and his friends all collecting baseball cards and playing softball or football pickup games. With the collapse of civic life due to two income families, diversity, and electronic entertainment, that‚Äôs almost vanished. The only ‚Äòteam‚Äô sport my older boy enjoyed was airsoft games, and the younger one spent a few years in a church-sponsored football team. Otherwise it was individual, paid athletics (fencing, MME, etc.). The younger one still watches football with dad although they both know I hate it.

                I have to chime in here to agree, with a caveat. My best sports experiences, by far, involved my own play or that of my kids. But the interest, shared experiences in pro and college sports was HIGH.So unlike many (most?) posters here that ‚Äúnever got into‚Äù I played a college sport. All of my four kids played college sports; two went to the NCAAs in their sport . We traveled. They traveled. Spent lots of time and $$$$.Now, zip. No interest in the enemy combatants that have occupied the diamonds, courts and fields. No watching, attending, gear, cable sports packages. Our whole family gave up the habit. We still play, train, work out, run marathons.Just ZFG about the pros. They are so laughable now, we do point and make comments for our own enjoyment. Like that LeBron character, cuts and runs first hint of his Chinese paymaster wanting him to.Think of these millionaires .. instead of playing and televising their stupid games on ‚ÄúNational TV‚Äù DURING the lockdowns, to keep up ‚Äúnational morale‚Äù, say like FDR wanted with MLB during World War 2 ‚Ä¶ these rich cowards ALL took their balls and pucks and ran away.No doubt they are chasing a new audience ‚Ä¶. hahahaha. As if. These clowns gonna be working at the car wash sooner rather than later.Good luck, boys!

                There‚Äôs a lot of incessant whining about ‚Äúwhat can we do?‚Äù ‚Äì well guess what:  going around telling people that ESPN gets a cut out of your wallet even though you don‚Äôt watch them ‚Äì is one thing you CAN do.
A couple of years ago there was some slight rumbling about that ESPN situation ‚Äì and people were giving their cable providers some amount of crap about it.  Don‚Äôt think it really went much of anywhere ‚Äì but at least there was finally some level of awareness.

                Pressure needs to be fed back up the chain to stop that kind of thing. If enough people start dumping cable ‚Äì for the explicit reason that they don‚Äôt want to pay for certain channels ‚Äì then sooner or later they‚Äôll be forced to take notice.
To paraphrase Tom Hanks: Your money goes up the chain, you pay the cable provider and the cable provider pays the content providers. If you stop paying the cable provider ‚Äì well then sooner or later the content provider loses money as well.

            That is the cable model. Whatever channels are in your package, whether you watch them or not, they‚Äôre getting a percentage of your cable bill. So if you have a channel in your package that you hate and so don‚Äôt watch it it doesn‚Äôt mean anything because they are still getting your money. The only way to cut it is to cut that bill

                    Likewise. I got rid of my TV in 2007 and haven‚Äôt owned one since. Further, I‚Äôve watched not more than a minute of TV in over 10 years. It‚Äôs become foreign to me and everything about it is inherently toxic.

                        I stopped watching the idiot box during the Brexit campaign over four years ago now. Not only do I not miss it, but when I find myself in a room where a TV is on, I find really annoying.

                    It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had a TV also but I traveled a lot before the pandemic and so I would travel to places and there would be a TV.

My globogym has giant tvs going constantly even though there are no sports to watch. Cheap entertainment to turn them off one by one and watch some chunky chica in poly sausage casings run around trying to re-ignite the warming glow for the poc contingent getting their daily talking points. Also buys me time to lose the mask for a heavy set. The dissident must learn to enjoy the smallest of victories.

                            Agree. A TV in my house has a high correlation with a partner who watches it endlessly. At one time, my ‚Äúquality time‚Äù with girlfriend was to watch one Lifetime or other movie of equivalent quality, most nights üôÇ Now I am probably a poor example of a man for a long-term relationship, but I am much happier without a TV or a TV-hypnotized female in my house.

            Cable came along for the masses in the ‚Äò70s. Ted Turner. ESPN debuted in 1979 and showed a lot of Australian Rules football because the North American broadcast rights were free. They gradually began to have the money to show US-mainstream sports. This is what led to the demise of the various games of the week.It also led to people getting cable. MTV was still several years away. In the early years, when there wasn‚Äôt much ‚Äòextra‚Äô content out there to populate cable channels, access to ESPN was probably the reason the majority of cable subscribers signed up.That‚Äôs where they got this leverage. It‚Äôs a vestigial organ that needs to be excise.

        I stopped watching sports, other than high school, 20 years ago. It got to where they were all black and way over-represented but no one saw a problem. But in other fields, like engineering, if blacks are under-represented then all hell breaks loose until some black bodies are hired.I guess I am just Boomer enough to say: fuck this shit. Either we have a level playing field like Martin Luther King wanted or we have quotas. If it is quotas and special treatment then I say it is time for war. Real blood in the streets.I am sick and tired of being a whipping boy just because my white ancestors build damn near everything that matters in this world.

        Here‚Äôs hoping the bell is tolling for major professional &amp; college sports.  Like a lot of others my age, I was a big fan 40 odd years ago.  However, the recent decades have seen the negrification of football and xspecially basketball ‚Äì our negros are better than yours.  Baseball is basically unwatchable as most games are interminable.  Announcers can‚Äôt just call the game, but have to pontificate on things no one wants to hear or gives a shit about.Now with all the coronatardation gripping the populace, I don‚Äôt see how any of this crap gets off the ground.  There won‚Äôt be any fans in the stands and players will continue to test ‚Äì  Oh My God ‚Äì positive.  Good riddance.

        I‚Äôm excited for spectator sports to collapse, but I‚Äôm even more excited in how this might destroy many state colleges. The biggest name brand private schools are basically mutual funds with vestigial buildings attached, but many state colleges aren‚Äôt nearly as rich and depend on sports to pull in Boomer alumni donations. If those dry up, along with the student loans‚Ä¶Industrial education needs to collapse even harder than industrial sports. There‚Äôs some viral video going around of refreshingly anti-BLM sentiments captured in some small town in Arkansas, but the people in the video mostly seem to be 50+ years old. At the end of the video a suicidal Zoomer hands the cameraman a pro-BLM note.The sad reality is that that Arkansas town may be majority ‚Äúbased‚Äù among the older people, but 90% of the white Zoomer and Alpha kids in that town are probably sucking the BLM cock. Both public education and higher education need to collapse now, yet Republicans, in their characteristic idiocy, are yammering on about the need to reopen schools in the fall.

        Of course people like athletes are refusing to play. I assume they get paid for the season anyway, why not get the same paycheck without taking the physical beating of a sports season?
The same is true with public teachers, most of them seem to be getting paid anyway without having to deal with unruly kids. Other than making it more difficult to seduce their students, why would a teacher not want to just stay home and collect a check?

        I suspect all sports, not just professional ones, are going to see a decline in attendance even here in Europe.For example European skiers are in decline and not just because of ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù and less snow ‚Äì although to be fair, that is a measurable factor.Wealthy boomers are getting too old to ski, and younger millennials can‚Äôt afford the cost of equipment, travel, hotels and ski passes.Millenials also spend less time on the slopes as their parents did at the same age. So hotels in the area are seeing a decline, as are restaurants and local shops. That means all the holiday homes will also earn less revenue since skiers can‚Äôt afford to stay as long.No pun intended, it‚Äôs a snow ball effect. üôÇHow is that working out in the US?

            Similar dynamic. Tennis was huge here in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs. Now the only people on the courts are newcomers from the Raj. Gold has been in decline for a decade here.

                That‚Äôs another possible trajectory for sportsball ‚Äî the plaything of the idle rich. I lived for a long time in a city with a failed professional hockey franchise. They marketed it to all the East Coast transplants as the old-time, blue-collar game they loved. The problem was, actual blue-collar types couldn‚Äôt afford the ludicrous ticket prices, the astronomical parking fees, the $12 beers, the $9 popcorn‚Ä¶ the only ones who actually attended the games, in other words, were corporate bag munchers ‚Äî marketing guys, lawyers, all of them still on their phones while the game was going on. I could see ‚Äúattending a sportsball event‚Äù becoming the new new conspicuous consumption ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to sell 20,000 tickets at $10 when you can sell 2,000 tickets at $100.

                        Little League exists, but I think you‚Äôre referring to the Minor Leagues ‚Äî each Major League club has several Minor League affiliates, where they develop young players (similar to the multi-tier system in soccer, I think). ‚ÄúLittle League‚Äù is organized youth baseball. But, like everything in America these days, it‚Äôs completely commercialized ‚Äî since all the parents are convinced that their kids are future stars, you have kids as young as 10 playing baseball year-round, going off to ‚Äútraining camps,‚Äù etc. It‚Äôs disgusting.

                                I have attended the Little League World Series a few times and it‚Äôs far and away the most enjoyable sporting event out there.  Williamsport itself may have its share of vibrancy but you‚Äôre still in the middle of rural PA, and for the most part you‚Äôre surrounded by your own people.  The games are free and high quality, everyone‚Äôs low key, players and fans mingle freely, and the anti-white symbols are minimal.  I still recommend it to anyone looking for an old(er)-fashioned sportsball event.

                        Karl, like your anecdote, best game I attended was the San Francisco Giants‚Äîfarm team.  The major team was playing in the local stadium to a sold out crowd, but also had their farm team playing the other farm team in the local practice field adjacent to the stadium.The practice field was very similar to any typical HS field with small area of bleacher seats right behind the batter‚Äôs box.  I managed to sit perhaps 15 feet behind the action.  I got a whole new insight into the skill and power of those players.  Nothing like being in the big league stadium a hundred feet from the side line.  Memories.

                I‚Äôd say young men have been extremely feminized while young women have been masculinized.
The problem is that, despite what the outdoor and running magazines will have you believe, there are very few women who stick with a sport after high school. Those masses of women simply do not exist.

                Along similar lines, Steve Sailer has been pointing out the decline of American football in high schools, in favor of less dangerous sports such as soccer and lacrosse.  There is an aspect of black avoidance in such choices, but I wonder about the increasing evidence of traumatic head injuries associated with football.  My father was an all-state high school football player, I played junior and senior high football, but if I had a son, I would counsel him to avoid playing football.

        It‚Äôs hard not to laugh. So the Joggers who took a knee are having to take a seat.The whole structure of cable fees where the ESPN‚ÄôS get their revenue by force from those who don‚Äôt watch is ripe for change. Trump should sic the FCC on them with a mandate to break it up within the next quarter- It really is time to take the war to them.

        Baseball embracing BLM is a major mistake. Looking at the comments section for various articles, such as one reporting that they‚Äôre displaying a BLM logo on the pitchers mound, show overwhelmingly angry comments.  Most along the lines of keeping politics out of sports, which is their ‚Äúescape‚Äù from all of that.  Many are now understanding the Marxist agenda of BLM also.When you scan the crowd at a major league baseball game, it‚Äôs very white.  There are some Hispanics, especially for Dodger games, but generally it looks like 1970s America. Scolding whites for their racism when all they want to do is enjoy a leisurely day at the ballpark, or at home, watch a game on TV without being to subjected to virtue-signalling commercials, is a major misreading of their audience.

            ESPN was reportedly thrilled four million viewers watched the opening night game between the Yankees and Nationals.Although baseball ratings had already gone off a cliff compared to what they were historically. What is the growth strategy when the graph for viewership of the World Series looks like this?  Last year‚Äôs series only averaged 14 million viewers because 23 million tuned into Game 7.

            My first Dodger game was one of those early moments of ‚Äúthis is not my country anymore‚Äù. Driving into ‚ÄúChavez Ravine‚Äù was like crossing into TJ from San Diego. The stands were still fairly white but the hostile swagger of the invaders and overall dirt-world vibe was quite a jolt. Even before I became situationally aware I thought it was a terrible place to be: one way in/out in an urban canyon surrounded by brown shantytowns and 50,000 people drinking for four hours.Fun fact. Chavez ravine was once a place where they housed smallpox patients during an outbreak in the mod 1800‚Äôs. It was also the site of the first Jewish outposts in LA. Now thats intersectionality lol. The pozz and the specials go way back.

        Most major cities already subside the arenas, maybe through various manipulations they will find a way to subsidize the teams themselves.

            The subsidies to build new arenas have been failing when put to the voters for several years now. City and state governments have been trying to bypass the voters to still get these deals done. The votes in San Diego, with fans being told outright the Chargers were leaving if it wasn‚Äôt approved weren‚Äôt even close. I doubt there will ever be a popular vote for a new sports stadium in the United States again. The argument city government types made that they drive economic growth was always dubious, but they can‚Äôt even try to make it now.

                On several occasions having visied two city arenas (RFK in DC and Veterans in Baltimore), I note they are usually ‚Äî not always* ‚Äî located in blighted urban areas. Even if city owned, I‚Äôm sure the well-connected made big bucks selling the property, or building the stadium. Even in my younger years, walking to/from the arena entrance exposed one to a distinctly unfriendly street life. I guess ‚Äúsafety in numbers‚Äù and there was some police presence, but I‚Äôd avoid such areas outside of major event times.Jobs for the locals? If only! Most of those people wouldn‚Äôt qualify to work at a McDonald‚Äôs, and probably wouldn‚Äôt show up if they were hired. Are they going to do any better as a groundskeeper or at one of the $10 hot dog and $15 beer concessions during a game? Doubtful üòÄ*Tampa‚Äôs 1-800-ASK-GARY arena or whatever it‚Äôs now called üôÇ is in a not-too-bad area, at least it doesn‚Äôt look like Berlin in late 1945 üòÄ

The games will be altered and made more vulgar to appeal to their coarser, more vulgar dusky audience. Whites will watch and be further coarsened. This is what happens when you let these folks in your culture ‚Äî you take them in and they become part of you, like it or not. Just as the Mexicans bred with the Africans in their country and those blacks became part of the Mexican fabric.

                            My cable package does not include ESPN.  Such would have been a show stopper.  However, as others have noted here, I should not have a ‚Äúpackage‚Äù period‚Äîand they‚Äôre right.

                            This is why you should cancel cable.As for effective boycott, A&amp;E cancelled the execrable Cop-A-Ganda show Live PD and lost half their audience.This won‚Äôt kill them off but it will reduce their ideological reach, the chance they can bait people into ‚Äúother stuff‚Äù and may well get them kicked off cable at some point.Its never futile to boycott , quietly and personally.

                    I think Corona Chan probably enables a ‚Äúfew years‚Äù strategy to be far more effective than it would otherwise.Total economic collapse does have a few upsides after all.However cutting sports, cutting TV , cutting streaming services , reducing Internet time can be jarring for people and so it may be that we have to take baby steps.They way I figure it, people with spare time in 1920 found stuff to do (whittle, machine shop, reading, art, martial arts practice) and we ought to do the same.

            Imo boycotts are pointless. We would need to boycott the whole economy and really the entire country. There‚Äôs a word for that kind of boycott: secession.
Any company that doesnt toe the line now can be brought to heel by greater financial powers. It is only a matter of time.

                The way that I see it, is that boycotts aren‚Äôt necessary about hurting whatever business, but more-so about upholding your convictions. I boycott many of businesses such as most large, multinational corporations. I no longer give business to Starbucks, Target, and other brands that enable, promote, and or support neo-Marxism in addition to destroying local, independent businesses. My decision to no longer stop in a Starbucks while on the road isn‚Äôt going to hurt their business. However, I can sleep better at night knowing that I‚Äôm staying true to my convictions and not supporting the enemy.

                        ‚ÄúIrrational fear of homosexuals‚Äù. Is that different from the normal dislike of homosexuals that most ordinary people have? In my case I experience a strong sense of disgust at the thought of homosexuality. As disgust is an evolved response to potential health threats, I consider it a rational fear, and, I believe that Mr Charles Darwin will fully support me on this.

I prefer the word homoloathing.  Or maybe homomosity.

                                It‚Äôs impossible to take these people serious as they‚Äôre sexual deviants who live a self-serving lifestyle. God produced man and woman to procreate, which is a generative act. Homosexuality is regressive as it doesn‚Äôt lead to procreation. Whether one is religious or not doesn‚Äôt matter in this case as even if you simply look at homosexuality from a Darwinist perspective, it‚Äôs unnatural for the very same reasons.In regards to the ‚Äúracist‚Äù insult, it was Trotsky who coined that term and we all know the motives behind Bolshevism in addition to the catastrophic results of such an evil ideology that has taken the lives of over 100 million during the 20th Century.Wear both insults with pride and don‚Äôt are an ounce like I do.

                            No expert here, unless reading a few books about evolution counts üôÇ Yes, homosexuality is ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù to humans, but not as much as you‚Äôd think. Of course, from the purely evolutionary biology point of view, homosexuality is not a survival trait simply because they would not reproduce. So they probably exist as a variant for whatever reason, sort of like the rare albino animal that would be unlikely to survive because of poor camouflage. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not defending the ass thief, but consider that while (say) homosexuality may be an aberration, it is not unknown. It does, in fact, occur among animals in nature sometimes. If you‚Äôve ever had you leg humped by a dog you can understand why. In a similar way, I can find you examples in the animal world of behavior that most humans would consider horrifying: Imagine you‚Äôre a man starting a new marriage, and the first thing you do is kill off all your step-children. Yet that‚Äôs exactly what big cats and other animals do. And the same happens in many eras when power is hereditary. If you‚Äôre a schemer in such a country, it is rational, albeit cold-blooded, to try to kill off your enemy and his extended family, lest they have a claim to the throne. And this wasn‚Äôt just the Borgias; murdering real or imagined opponents has a long, bloody history in the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù Soviet Union. Just ask Stalin.Unlike buggery, It ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù in evolutionary terms, because certain genes ‚Äúwant‚Äù to survive at the expense of others.

                    I cant disagree with you there. Minimizing your economic footprint, even if it doesnt hurt the enemy, probably is good for the soul and worth it for that alone. I also avoid tv and video games and most movies cos i have kids and the thought of voluntarily paying someone to brainwash them is too much.

                        I agree. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Walmart, etc. are all monopolies who‚Äôve caused us great harm. However, many can be avoided with some will power. I quit using Amazon in 2017 and that was a lot easier than you‚Äôd think. There are many of alternatives to Google and Walmart. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs difficult to move past Microsoft because they‚Äôre universally used within the global business world. However, Russia has recently banned their services from being used within their country, so there might be some hope for other accessible options.

                    Courage is as much a habit as any other virtue.  Boycotting people who hate you seems like an easy way to get into the habit of actually making sacrifices, no matter how small, for your supposed beliefs.  Religious groups have understood this for centuries.  The Catholic giving up something for Lent is affirming, both to himself and others, that he believes.There‚Äôs also the networking aspect of finding alternatives to those few consumer items you actually need.  This is going to be hugely important if we want to create an alternative economy and lifestyle.  I got a bag of that Chaga stuff that Z is hawking.  It turns out I like it but more importantly I also now know of at least one business that isn‚Äôt completely pozzed.  This kind of knowledge can help you with practical things like finding work, especially for people who have been unpersoned by the corporate world for various types of wrongthink.Finally, on another level this is valuable as a way of breaking away from the consumer lifestyle that is used to milk and enslave us.  Why are our (((fellow whites))) so notoriously tight with a dollar?  It‚Äôs because they never allowed themselves to get hooked on consumerism like whites.  They‚Äôre perfectly happy gettingyouhooked of course, because they‚Äôve figured out how to profit from that.  It‚Äôs a simple matter of not getting high on your own supply.

                Boycott implies something temporary.  As in ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to buy your product or service until you do what I want‚ÄùIf you‚Äôre so cucked that you can‚Äôt divorce yourself entirely from the enterprise after they finally can‚Äôt stop themselves any more and come right out and demonstrate and tell  you to your face that they are your enemy (which is something you should have figured out long before now anyway) ‚Äì then what we‚Äôre really talking about here is a hopeless case.All you‚Äôre offering up is an excuse.  TAKE AWAY THE DAMN MONEY.   When BOA gives away a billion dollars to BLM ‚Äì remove all your money from their bank and go someplace else.  That‚Äôs not a boycott ‚Äì that‚Äôs a refusal to do business with your enemy and support them in any way shape or form as they try to destroy you.There‚Äôs plenty of other things to do with your time than watch sportsball. Fire the landscaper and go mow the lawn yourself.  Learn how to mill an AR out of block of aluminum.  Go birdwatching, go watch some black on white porn (if you‚Äôre watching the NFL you obviously like getting screwed in the ass by black men ‚Äì try porn ‚Äì it‚Äôs cheaper)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..  whatever.The whole ‚Äúboycotts don‚Äôt work‚Äù thing is just an excuse for inaction.

                    You might like it better at Vox Day‚Äôs blog where anyone who says anything remotely grounded in reality is similarly called a black piller and shouted down with insults.A call to action only works if it is effective action. A boycott may be action, but its not effective action. Im all for doing something, but my patience for bad ideas or avoiding grappling with the difficult facts of our situation has run out. We pissed away decades on conservatism, white nationalists, shilling, and every other mode of ‚Äúaction‚Äù that has amounted to nothing. No need to dredge up tactics from prior decades that didnt work then either.

                        Seriously ‚Äì what is wrong with you? I keep saying ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a friggin boycott. Move your goddam money into places where it doesn‚Äôt go to fund your enemies.If these ‚Äúactions‚Äù haven‚Äôt amounted to anything ‚Äì it‚Äôs probably because YOU DIDN‚ÄôT ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING.Why is it that one of the most constant behaviors that I‚Äôve noticed out of conservative and/or right wing types ‚Äì is their constant whining when asked to take ANY form of actual action.Funding your enemies is the real bad idea. In fact it‚Äôs just moronic. But I guess that‚Äôs maybe the Republican party has been called the Stupid Party over and over again.When are you going to face the fact the left stays alive ‚Äì THRU FUNDING.  Break their damn bank.

Instead of canceling their cable they‚Äôd prefer to wait for the government to pass a law requiring unbundling, which will never happen.
You know, if our side keeps losing maybe our side is full of losers.

                        Like many of us, I‚Äôve given up on Facebook, Twitter and most recently NextDoor, primarily due to censorship of opinion, even if I wasn‚Äôt a direct victim. In the NextDoor case, I specifically said why I was leaving, and basically it was that free thought was suppressed, that critical issues were discouraged if not outright forbidden, and msot importantly, that I refused to participate any more. In Rand‚Äôs terms, I was withdrawing my consent. I don‚Äôt expect these entities to reform themselves to my standards, but neither will I lower myself to theirs. The best kind of boycott is when you choose for yourself alone ‚Äî and perhaps, with time, you‚Äôll find you are better off without the good or service you gave up.

                    I boycott Nike but I still have two perfectly good Nike athletic shirts. I wear them inside-out to hide the Nike logo. In general, I don‚Äôt wear clothing with logos unless I agree with the company/organization.

                As Amwolf has noted, boycotts are for you not them.The idea  is they don‚Äôt get as much of YOUR money, as little as possible.One thing we can learn from the Left is encouraging ideological purity, ‚Äúright think‚Äù because if you are still staring back at Sodom and Gomorrah, you are still under their thumb.Go do something productive for yourself and your kin or go start a flag football league with like minded neighbors, play D&amp;D do something but chow down on the trash they want you to eat.This many not kill them outright but they will have less space in your head and less cultural reach.

                Sorry to double post but I forgot something. You actually can and probably should basically boycott the whole economy.Buy only what you need and your preps from friendlies if possible and save in cash as much as you can.The less you buy, the weaker the system gets and while you can‚Äôt kill it since for the time being fake bucks are still being taken, as we‚Äôve seen the system is very fragile.It can die of neglect and the fact no one wants it and if you are ready? Maybe you can get what you want politically.This is the legal , non violent moral way to go El Sendero Luminoso meets Benedict Option

            Yes. The opportunity is here for all of us is to provide the nudge about supporting the enemy to those in our sphere. But thats only part of it.Some of these men will be pretty bummed out by losing one of their main distractions. I recommend focusing less on the negatives, ‚ÄúESPN/NFL hates you‚Äù etc and more on the positives. Their dance card just opened up.For the first time, these men will have free time that many have been claiming to never have. Thursday night NFL. All day Saturday CFL. All day Sunday NFL. Monday night FB.Now is the time to open the garage, workshop, basement; organize projects to improve each others properties; skills exchanges; online classes on small engine repair. Head to the river or the range or the gym.There is a vacuum; lets fill it. We win not by merely rejecting the toxic culture and marketplace of our enemies, but by providing more enriching, useful, and constructive alternatives that are accretive to building the communities we desire.Don‚Äôt let those guys slip from NFL to some other sedentary opiate. With something better on the table they will connect the dots. And be less likely to embrace the pozz when it returns.

                +1, Screwtape. Removing support should be energized by where you plan to invest that support. Our people are natural builders and while all men will trend toward laziness, we are the least lazy (as proven by, well, all of the modern world).Let us get back to the roots of work. Hobbies that take some level of committment, pursuit of mastery, community found with those pursuing similar. THAT is where we can go,rightnow.Watching people play anything should cause us to question what it is we are finding value in. Remember, if it‚Äôs ‚Äúfree‚Äù, you are the product.

            &gt;you‚Äôre really not cut out for this fightAnd there it is.So rather than a virtue-signalling circle jerk about when we woke up about sportsball or stopped watching tv‚Ä¶Act.Salt the open wound that millions of young white fans are presently suffering. They are out there.Target pro baseball and college football forums. The closer to home, the better.  Troll in the spaces where sports-based video games and things like fantasy football intersect with social media.Pound away on the greed, stupidity, criminality and cowardice of the players.Break their young hearts now. This sort of cruelty may be a kindness in the long run.10,000 young white men violently alienated from sportsball is what we want.This is far more important than a million boomers whining about making the ultimate sacrifice: cleaning the garage instead of watching Tyrone Jamal D‚ÄôMarcus prancing around in an empty stadium.

            I refuse to use P&amp;G products (one of my many boycotts).  How many white males have done this?  10%?  Maybe?  Even when belittled by advertising they still thoughtlessly throw the same products into their basket.  It‚Äôs a pride issue.  It‚Äôs and honor issue, even if the bottom line isn‚Äôt felt by P&amp;G.  There‚Äôs not much hope for the brainwashed.  The best counter to it is having some incident that turns your life upside down.  The ‚ÄúAfrican American Friend‚Äù who you thought was your friend who completely f-ed you over, showing him to be a true nigger that hated you all along.  This never happened to me because I was raised not to associate with them, but for the majority things like this have to happen.

                College football used to be fun to watch in addition to attending the games when an opportunity arose. However, it‚Äôs best to quit supporting college football simply because of how most US colleges and universities are now chest-deep in their support of Cultural Marxism and have become overrun by SJWs. I graduated from a top tier college football powerhouse and top 50 globally ranked university who was one of the first to axe their homecoming king and queen because it wasn‚Äôt inclusive. Now my school believes that there are no genders and routinely attacks conservatives on campus by making them feel extremely unwelcomed.

        I wish I could see this, but I think the shakeout will be minimal.  You have a lot of wiggers out there.  Some even have tats of their favorite sportsball teams.  A lot of whites out there are as dumb as a box of nails.  By no means the same level as blacks.  They also have no pride or sense of identity.  Even the ones who make good money spend it on dumb things like a competition barbecue trailer or a massive TV that they hang outside on their RV at a tailgate‚Ä¶or anything made by Dodge.  The biggest problem sports ball will have will be the tailspin of income from these people as they become unemployed.  Also, the country is going through a class issue just as much as a race issue.  Pleb culture has totally dominated high culture in late stage democracy.

            It can be demoralizing to see the ghetto culture infect our people. So we have to focus energy where it is most productive. Triage is part of the process. Minimal is still more than zero, a lot better than negative, which is where things have been going. The shakeout net needn‚Äôt catch the whigggers and other unfortunates. We need to stop thinking about how to save all whites or change the world or stop the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù from doiing xyz and start thinking about what kind of people we want in our lives and actively pursue those people. Create bonds with worthy men and build it up from there. Iron sharpens iron. Have faith that there are a great many of us in the shadows of the various ghettos who have a great hunger for kinship and purpose. Lets figure out how to bring them into the fold.

            Not many places to escape too. Everywhere is falling apart. You also better hope whoever takes over can‚Äôt keep the nukes (or build new ones) or other lo range weapons and is adverse to using them.Otherwise those rich foreign  people spending down gold assets in your country have just painted a massive target on your back.Tunr them over for revolutionary justice or else a city gets it is pure Bond villain but I‚Äôd bet it will work.

                Conversely, the PRC is led by a cabal of aggressive schemers with a massive superiority complex.  If one doesn‚Äôt want to abide by a seemingly organized campaign against them, fine, but resist the urge to think they are anything but your enemy, politically and racially.  If you think Jews do a shitty job as your cultural and economic overlords, you have no idea how much worse the Chinese would be.

                The best example I can think of in regards to mainstream America‚Äôs ability to get spooked by the boogeyman ‚Äì was the whole ISIS thing.   Judging by the reactions I saw from a good many people  you would have thought that ISIS Bear bombers were cruising up and down the east coast and the US Navy had submarines tracking the ISIS blue water navy as they sailed their 100,000 man invasion force towards the beaches of the Outer Banks.It was a definite insight into the mindset of a good many people in this country and their unthinking fear of whatever boogeyman they were being presented with at the current time.

                On the contrary, after reviewing my life experiences with many of the people I had to work with ‚Äî Asiatics of every sort; Africans of every sort (domesticated and foreign); and Middle Easterners of every sort ‚Äî I have concluded that those IQ results are mostly propaganda.The Jews and Asiatics arehighly overrated! Just because one knows how to study for an exam does not mean one has the analytical discipline to be accurate AND decisive. And creativity cannot be measured by exams.If the future is to be saved, it is The West which needs to be guarded with our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor; and only genuine Christianity will provide the strength of character to accomplish this.

        I took an interest in pro sports starting when I was in college when I saw that the one safe subject for conversation was how the sports teams were doing. Without the social aspect, a lot of people will ignore pro sports.

            This is an excellent point. Sports talk serves as a cultural bridge in a multi cultural work space. Take away that lingua franca and smoothing over differences becomes a lot more difficult. Especially as racial tensions rise.

        There‚Äôs the famous saying that ‚Äúfacts are stubborn things.‚Äù  Demographics are more stubborn.  Like all things seemingly COVID related, all these baked-in-the-cake consequences have merely been accelerated.  We don‚Äôt need to boycott for the sake of ESPN‚Äôs demise ‚Ä¶ we need to boycott everything that sucks positive productive energy from our lives.  Motives matter.

                        Refer to earlier posts in this thread where people whined about ‚Äúboycotts‚Äù.   In my experience the whining from people even when you point out explicitly how they‚Äôre getting screwed over by some institution ‚Äì is just pathetic.  ‚ÄúBoycott‚Äù appears to be some sort of trigger word along the lines of ‚Äúisolationist‚Äù.  My guess is that lefties intentionally go after people when ‚Äúboycotts‚Äù are discussed because they know if they got legs against certain institutions ‚Äì they‚Äôd be hard pressed to make up what was lost.That‚Äôs why  I mention ‚Äúisolationist‚Äù ‚Äì because I remember how Ron Paul (and others) were attacked with the word ‚Äì when all they were trying to propose was that we mind our own damn business as a nation ‚Äì and stop starting wars.  Lefties don‚Äôt like any inference that people should be left alone.So they get attacked

                        Whatever, the language po-leese, seriously. I started boycotting Burger King the moment they condoned throwing shakes at Nigel Farage. McD, BLM = minus me. Now it is obvious that these companies sell a toxic product made to make you obese, and are greasy. They serve as magnets for cheap labor, cough, cough. And yet even their ESL employees are getting replaced by automation, kiosks right out in front of them.The list grows, and it is remarkable when you personally tally up the $$ that even ONE person can deny these Marxist fronts. Mike/Apple ‚Äì the slave/indentured/forced labor crowd, same thing ‚Äì zero spending.Sure, like the WNBA caters only to older lesbians ‚Ä¶ no doubt the Wokesters have an unlimited supply of new customers not named me heheheheSure.

        NBC (owned by Comcast a chief competitor of Disney, owner of ESPN) is dancing around to cope with this- and the possibility of disaggregated cable fees by pushing a lot of Sports content onto a Web Channel- Peacock.com, free at a basic level but $5-$10 a month for most.When all of this settles out it will be a hoot to see what happens to the Public Broadcasting System.https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/04/15/why-isnt-pbs-included-cable-alternatives/469817002/

        This demographic cliff has been known to the sports leagues for a long time, which is why they happily throw in with the hate-whitey stuff. Sure, many of the principles really do hate white people, but much of it driven by the carnival barker‚Äôs belief in his ability to will an audience into existence. They really do think they can cast the same spell on the brown hordes that they cast on white people and get the same result. The virus panic and cultural revolution will put those theories to the test.Cable providers will collapse almost simultaneously for these very reasons, even if they get out from the ESPN-type contracts. Boomers are the last television audience, and they either won‚Äôt be around soon enough or, as you point out, realize it is a needless expense and cut it out.What will be hilarious is when franchise owners go to city officials and try to extort new stadiums as they did in the past. Ain‚Äôt happening.

        On the other hand, sports entertainment has been a vital part of keeping whitey under control. Something will have to be done to reestablish the mind control device known as sportsball.They can‚Äôt let it go.  They will probably drastically shorten schedules and cut salaries while they ratchet up the marketing to get YT worked up for the big clash once or twice a week.  We‚Äôll see a lot more corporate sponsorship and other forms of public hoopla helping to set the stage and raise interest in these events. There will be a lot more narrative leading up to the game and a lot of follow up as the denouement gives everyone their needed resolution fix. Sports will add more and more soap opera to what happens before they take the field and for after they leave the field.  Until things decay even more it will probably work like a charm regardless of all of the anti white nonsense.  Humans are draw to spectacle especially if there‚Äôs a story with a lot of emotional tie-ins to heighten appeal and hold attention.

                            That does raise another question about Covid shutdowns, what are Native American tribes going to do to make up for the revenue shortfalls they will get hit with this year?  They had to already be in decline a lot places because of other legalized gambling, and it isn‚Äôt like they can turn to other sources of revenue to make up the difference.

                What the leagues dont realize Z, is that all this woke jaboonery will finally drive home to Whitey that he has a target on his back.  How do you think he is going to spend his Sundays now?  At the gun range;  rehearsing tactics for conflict, noting who in his community is on the other team.  In short, he will be preparing for war.The reason fighting is allowed in hockey is so the players dont bash each other over the head with sticks.  Sportsball serves the same purpose; it lets whitey blow off steam, and brainwashes him into thinking we are all one big happy country.Give Whitey some credit; when he finally shifts into gear he is a pretty remarkable killing machine.  Taking sportsball away will lead to spitting on hands, hoisting the black flag, and the slitting of throats.

                At the risk of outing myself as a complete loser, i have watched professional counterstrike esports which is why i used that example.I dont play video games anymore, but when i did that game was my go to. Watching the pros was interesting, in a similar way that to me football is the most interesting sport: they have to fight for every inch of territory and occasionally the teamwork comes together just right to allow one guy to make a big ‚Äúplay‚Äù. It was mildly exciting for a few matches and then it quickly wears off.I understand the appeal sort of. But that probably highlights the biggest weakness of esports: necessarily small audiences. If you play the game, you may be temporarily interested in watching until gets boring and something newer and cooler comes out. If you dont play you not only wont care, but you may not even be able to understand how the game works in the first place. Any outsider can see whats happening in baseball but try figuring out whats happening in starcraft 2 or caring about it just by watching.

                    I don‚Äôt know, football is pretty impenetrable.  When I was relating the rules to a foreigner they were baffled as to why I was watching what was apparently a courtroom drama sprinkled a smidge of violence concerning an oblong ball.

                        Yup, time for some new sports.  Motorboat destruction derby.  Unmanned RTV mine field crossings (how far can they get before they blow up?).

                That‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt play computer yourself. It‚Äôs like with soccer: if you do not have the faintest idea about what‚Äôs going on on the pitch, all you see is people kicking a ball around.At any rate, you don‚Äôt watch the players in esport, you watch the game. I used to watch televised Starcraft tournaments ‚Äì the players were all from South Korea, so it‚Äôs impossible to tell them apart in the first place. There‚Äôd be the occasional shot of the players, sitting utterly motionless in their perspex bubbles since their hands were below the frame, but 96% of the time, you‚Äôd be watching the game.

Joe Rogan is 100% right they are a huge time sink with no redeeming benefit.

                True. Couple that with cut throat economics for the publisher leading to rushed production, hiring of more incompetent designers, and more political intrusion and aside from prior dopamine addiction to gaming the appeal is getting harder to see.

                Big time lifetime gamer here and the story I always relate is an interview Game Informer had with the guy who ‚Äúbeat World of Warcraft‚Äù (i.e., had completed EVERY task, at the time).  When they asked him how he felt about his accomplishment he said (paraphrasing) ‚Äúnothing but an f‚Äôn waste of time‚Äù.As far as distractions go, you could do worse, but as the other commentator here points out, development has hit a wall.  Triple-A titles any more are just reskinned takes on previous efforts, but now full of Poz‚Äôed bullshit that makes it tiresome rather than enjoyable.

            It‚Äôs no joke. That is essentially what esports boils down to ‚Äì insane mouse DPI tracking and superior frame rates. There‚Äôs even celebrity-style endorsement contracts that occur.

        Your demographic points are also why the NBA has made itself completely subservient to China. More people in China watched the last game of the 2019 NBA Finals than watched in the U.S. This is their plan to survive the collapse in U.S. fan interest. Eventually they will likely have two divisions, one of American teams which will only be located in major cities and one in China.

        Reading all of the anecdotes regarding sports on TV, I am reminded of my favorite memory regarding a sporting event. The year was 1987 and Dennis Conner was attempting to get the cup back from the Aussies. The problem was it was being held half way around the world, and aired around 1:00 AM. My wife and I would nap and then get up to watch. Funny what you do when you‚Äôre young and newly married. I still get goosebumps remembering the final turns of a race and Conners spinnaker unfurling. It was a wonderful feeling of pride. It was like hitting another gear when they put that sail out.On the other hand, I gave up Facebook a few years ago. I was on that thing constantly, and it always pissed me off. I really don‚Äôt miss it. My visits are to Z, Unz, Secondcitycop, and Heyjackass.

        another field that will take a hit very soon btw is the nerd entertainment one, which has been so based on jews drawing crazy comic-book stuff for whites for decades‚Ä¶ until these whites are weak enough from all the babble to be stabbed in the back; in the name of diversity and alluring the mythical mountains of black and brown nerds that must exist somewhere, according to (((them))) at least. fortunately many of these nerd-whites do tend to be more discerning than the sports-whites and vote with their feet and wallets more often; however, they still have the habit ingrained, and thus tend to be somewhat purplepilled and claim they don‚Äôt mind black and brown nerds having their own sphere. therefore they don‚Äôt mind that Spiderman starts dating a colored girl, or becoming colored altogether in cartoon movies, for they still have their white Spidey‚Ä¶ until (((they))) decide ‚Äúwe all should be a little more diverse, dontcha think?‚Äù

            Both Marvel and DC exists to sell movies and animation. Comics though are serious SJW infested and basically dead.Another upside of Corona Chan is the harm done to TV and Movie production and the losses . The sooner these are weakned or better die and are replaced by something else the better.We are almost to the point where green screens and computers can make good films cheap and online distribtuion through our own sources makes them available and profitable. We can and should have a parallel economy where wqe do as little business with outsiders as possible.And yes I can hear the ‚ÄúOur Prosperity!‚Äù suck it.

        Sportsball TV watching was always more of an escapism ritual than anything about the game itself. It‚Äôs a way to ignore their nagging wives, forget about their dead end jobs and just enter into another world for a weekend.Its been chiseled away at for decades. First you had the lie that domestic violence increased during the Super Bowl. That got so much backlash the left retreated from sportsball for the 90s and into some of the 2000s. Then it was hiring female reporters. At first they played up the eye candy but they sucked the oxygen out of whatever room they were at. They really played up the Erin Andrews scandal because it was the perfect wedge issue to start ruining sportsball. Vegging out in the man cave watching college ball was the same as peeping Erin Andrews yourself. You couldn‚Äôt escape it; I‚Äôm not condoning it but the response was so over the top you knew there was the motte and bailey long con getting set up for us.The next step was virtue signaling. Not about BLM but you had garbage like wearing pink shoes for breast cancer awareness. I remember Rush Limbaugh dedicating big chunks of his show complaining about it. Of course all the bluster was ignored because it was Obama‚Äôs first term I believe and the left was emboldened to push regardless of what people thought. Lots of effort was made into bringing in women. The boomer husband watched sportsball to ignore his increasingly overweight wife for the weekend; he had no interest bringing her into his home away from home. Ratings began dipping I believe for this reason. The race issue has only exacerbated the decline. My guess is that Disney will strongarm cable companies to pay inflated rates for ESPN. The narrative demands it.I played starting varsity football in high school and have friends and family who played college and professional baseball and football. I‚Äôve never been a big sportsball watcher because it‚Äôs never been that compelling. It‚Äôs usually a great time to go to the gym because of how it empties out. Or walk my dog or do dozens of other things that are more worthwhile than zonking out on ESPN.

        ball parks in 60s and 70s were emptier, and tv baseball down, because integration on one hand and urban decay around parks in another. on the other hand though, nfl boomed those years, perhaps as it is a superior tv sport ‚Äì and therefore the first to blackify most alongside basketball, which was eventually inevitable due to the height requirement.hockey remains white, perhaps because it was the uncucked winter alternative to basketball; then again, both were created by cucked nordics and northern anglos, so who knows; at least the ice naturally wards off tropical colors away. tennis and golf are elite and therefore getting ever more gentry-liberal, so they will be aimed at too, if perhaps less successfully.yes, it is possible old sports entertainment breaks down and something else replaces it. it does seem the current aim is making black athletes demigods to white viewers, therefore making them bow to them and at best only vicariously live through them on Sunday broadcasts/masses and nightly videogames/rosaries. in short, yet another apostasy due to going from tradition to materialism. whites may have to come up with their new own games, specially those better suited to their skill (for example, hunting and fishing make use of the larger white ability to aim, as well as for patience). or better yet, recover their old Victorian games and their own leagues. we may rightfully mock the sportsball racket, but i see more and more allergies-ful soyfied comic-book and pornhub loving white kids, and more and more promotion of black and brown athletes as a male aesthetic standard. so some athletic heroes are needed for whites to some degree, so white basement dwelling ends. of course, this shouldn‚Äôt mean giving these athletes room to talk politics (unless based) nor become celebs, but rather serve as example to kids.i come from the Medi soccer tradition so on one hand i do see the solidarity of white youths in ultra fan groups, and some few remaining white athletes giving great example (for example, Croatia in the last World Cup); but on the other hand painfully see these white youths waste away their savings in airport-stadiums cheering for blacks and browns who hate them and usually have reckless lives (see crazy cokehead mestizo Maradona for example, or soulless corporate mulatto Pele). in fact i may even notice more and more white players becoming stupid and reckless (more than common among pro athletes) due to twin materialism and blackification crowding their minds. i am reminded of Gronkowski in the NFL, or in soccer the sad case of Paul Gascoigne, who led England a few decades ago but is now a raving cockney drunk that everyone in the pub culture cheers on or looks sad at: but no one does stop him.the asians don‚Äôt have this problem, all their bodies allow them to play is go, mahjongg, and eat the bat/doggie first; plus they did not import Africans en masse to work in malaria fields‚Ä¶ although judging how many childless men and overworked women are growing in numbers there due to materialism, wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they started bringing in foreign ‚Äúnannies‚Äù and ‚Äúsecurity guards‚Äù; some of these nations already do have guest workers after all‚Ä¶

The world is ran on market forces. If the education system brought in the kind of money that the sports industry does every year, the administrators and professors would be living in Hollywood mansions. Red China finally got the message. Which makes the demise of pro sports the least of your problems.

He‚Äôs also a sports medicine fellowship director.Pugely earned about $1.1 million in 2018, and holds the title of assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation.As orthopedic surgeons, they deal with the musculoskeletal system and the sorts of injuries athletes might face. Coaching is important for the student-athletes, but so is keeping them on the field.I think the Dean of the University of Iowa medical school gets close to $500,000 a year.  The governor of Iowa (Kim Reynolds) is paid $130,000 a year.This is madness!!!

        Z‚Äôs losing his touch. The entire essay scarcely mentions the ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù politics that has poisoned even pro sports, taking the knee, the Black Anthem and whatever the latest foolishness is. I know that he makes much mention of this elsewhere, it‚Äôs just odd that he doesn‚Äôt mention it as part of Pro Sports‚Äô decline. I‚Äôm not a sports fan, but I can sympathize with former game watchers losing the opportinity to even indulge. Blame the pandemic for most of that, but Z‚Äôs essay shows many of the other contributors to its decline. Probably this is wishing for too much, but perhaps major universities will return to what universities were for: higher education. Sports long ago was incidental; it was physical exercise for students who wanted it. I‚Äôm sure books have been written about it, but it seems as though ‚Äúcollege ball‚Äù was a backdoor way to get more Blacks into university. Problem was, they had to attend, and in theory, pass their classes. We all know well that‚Äôs worked out. I have little sympathy for the media companies and cable companies seeing declining revenue. Part of that is technology driven: there is competition from the Internet and other forms of entertainment. The grossly overpaid athletes will have to adopt a more frugal lifestyle. There never were a lot of multi-million dollar salaries for room-temperature IQ males that happened to have above-average athletic abilities, but now there will be even less.I‚Äôve only intermittently had cable or satellite TV in my life, usually when I had a TV-addicted mate living in the home. I still marvel at how insipid and repetitive is the programming, despite having a hundred or a thousand channels. It‚Äôs 99.9% shit. The only media service I pay for now is internet. It gets me stuff like this, also streaming music and video. No, I can‚Äôt watch the next local NFL or college basketball game, nor am I going to pay $200/mo to the cable company for the privelege of seeing the latest politically correct bullshit. I wouldn‚Äôt even pay for the internet, but the neighbor that kindly had an open wi-fi for years is no longer available üòÄ

            Blacks in college sports at any major school is probably not the way to get minority attendance numbers up as they‚Äôre just not that many athletes‚Äîeven if everyone were Black.

        And just like that DHS gives up even on the pretense of law and order:https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1288501879337451521Yeah, the DHS head is covering his cowardice with some mealy-mouthed BS about phased withdrawal, transitioning to state police, drawing down their forces and augmenting with other resources instead, blah blah blah, but the fact is the governor of Oregon would not have released such specific information (‚Äústarting tomorrow‚Ä¶‚Äù) had she not gotten some kind of reassurance from DHS on their retreat.I guess DHS was worried about ‚Äúoptics‚Äù!Ultimately most of us couldn‚Äôt care less if Portland burns to the ground, but it‚Äôs illuminating to watch the civil war between different branches and levels of government blossom. Civil wars aren‚Äôt started by peasants, they‚Äôre started when a government and its managerial class turns on itself.

            So what is the end game? Oregon state cops follow governors orders and allow anti fa to burn down the federal court house and likely much of downtown?
if President Kushner had balls which he doesn‚Äôt he‚Äôd copy Lincoln and jail half the country. Of course the riots according to Gallup have something like 80% approval so there is that. On the other hand the Joint Chiefs might just remove Trump and install Biden and Harris really.

                Perceptive comment!  Trump clearly has the legal authority to protect federal property whether state and local officials like it or not, but there is a real question over whether his orders would be followed or not.  And it wouldn‚Äôt have to be military‚Äìsome combination of the FBI, CIA, NSA, Federal marshalls and a portion of the armed protective services of federal agencies could stage a coup.  The Secret Service and the military could just stand aside.

        I think rock climbing could become a valid pro-sport.  I‚Äôm seeing more of these climbing centers open up and watching a competition on TV, it really kept my attention.  I‚Äôm not sure if blacks can dominate this sport.  1)  it doesn‚Äôt involve a ball.  2)  you need a physique that doesn‚Äôt have a giant ass dragging you down.  3)  It involves strategy and forward thinking as you maneuver.  While they genetically still have one hand in the tree and I‚Äôm sure they can climb well, like through smashed windows to loot, I‚Äôm not sure if they have the correct body structure and brain to dominate rock climbing.  Much like golf you could have your outlier Tiger Woods types in a mostly white sport.

            I‚Äôm a former technical climber with friends who climb. When we watch films in private of others climbing we invariably speed up the videos to get to the parts that interest us and then we switch it off and talk about more entertaining things or go out for beers and broads. Without a backstory like free climbing or a particularly challenging route or a family problem (such as a handicap) the sustained viewer interest in climbing just isn‚Äôt there. Popular sports are lucrative for professional athletes because ordinary folks can participate in them at some level. Ordinary folks boulder at the same meh! climbing wall over several months for the most part and then they manage to get busy with other stuff and seldom come back. Not gonna work in my unsolicited opinion.

        The Olympics would be a good test of the theory. Totalitarian states love the Olympics. The USSR used to go all-in on‚Ä¶ well, they went all-in on everything, of course, but they used to pay particular attention to those contests that their ethnics could win. Karelin, the great wrestler, was from Siberia, for example. When are the next Games, 2022? Let‚Äôs see if President Abrams goes full-blast for Team USA, full of all-American patriots named Gomez, Chatterjee and Kung Pao.

                Yes. I have expressed similar views on the importance of heritage in the past to friends, mostly the response was a tepid agreement but they still ‚Äògot behind our man‚Äô. Of course, it is hard to consider him ‚Äòyour man‚Äô when he comes out draped in the Union Jack and the flag of Nigeria‚Ä¶ And that is before we even get to the genetic matter.I have to say that the recent debacle with sport and the constant anti-white rhetoric have made it easier, for me at least, to broach this formerly delicate subject with other people who previously would not have been receptive. The simple line ‚ÄòWhy would I support him and his anti-white stance‚Äô has met with far more warmth in recent times than it did even a couple of years ago. One plus, I suppose.

                        what the hell are you people trying to prove?Whether all of our higher ups believe it or not, the system they a part of seems to want to convince us that we are a multicultural paradise. And always have been. But of course it is not true.The while obsession with acceptance and now, celebration is an entirely feminine thing in my opinion. To be quite honest, too many joggers in the English national football team always bugged me but I could have accepted it were diversity not relentlessly pushed in every other aspect of life. The billboards as I drive to work, the advertisements on television, the seminars/training given in companies, the way normal people even think these things are worthwhile talking points. Everything.I actually think that there are some fairly conservative MPs on backbenches for both main parties here. I think they know the problems and often I wonder ‚Äòwhat do you boys say in private‚Äô. But in this system, even a person with a fair amount of power must look around him, see younger people (as well as those of his own generation) spewing very bizarre ideas and think ‚Äòhow can I stop this‚Äô. That is the miracle of democracy, the buck doesn‚Äôt really seem to stop with anyone.On a more positive note, The Isles have over 1000 years of solid history ‚Äì almost exclusively white ‚Äì and this is hard to rewrite, but they‚Äôre trying. The system has broken. Don‚Äôt bother trying to fix it. Continue to educate those who are salvageable and identify the most conservative parts of the country and move there with your tales of diversity‚Ä¶ You need to network. You need allies.

            I looked at Nats game for a few minutes and it was very strange. In some parks they are using cardboard cutouts to populate the seats behind the plate. It is too ridiculous to tolerate. They are piping in fake fan noise, but it is too obviously fake.The thing about fans at the games is they serve as social proof for the TV viewer. The viewer sees a big crowd or lots of crowd noise and he gets the feeling the event is important. Our brains have been conditioned that way. The announcers always talk about the crowd and how much energy there is in the stadium.I suspect after the initial novelty wears off, interest collapses.

                I might add that fans project impressive plays onto their active fantasies as they watch. The football receiver who hauls down an impossible catch and jukes for a score is us and the crowd roar and chants are for us. That jumping cheerleader with major league yabbos is looking right at us.Fan lives are often pretty dreary and devoid of meaning, for example, nobody applauds when you wash the car and take out the garbage bags. Sports ball and perhaps an intoxicating substance, or bonding with your buddies and enjoying the camaraderie, helps remove us from the drudge.I personally never really got into watching sports.

Bingo! Without the fans, it‚Äôs just a bunch of men in silly outfits playing a kids‚Äô game. Sure, they‚Äôre extremely good at what they do, but in the end, what they‚Äôre doing is no different nor more important than a bunch of regular guys playing in a softball league.

                        The last time I watched, however briefly, ‚Äúregular guys‚Äù playing basketball was a night game at the Y at least 15 years ago. They were all White; they were all in their 20‚Äôs and early 30‚Äôs; there were no fans; and they were (very obviously) having fun. I hope that continues into the future.

                        Playing league dodgeball is really fun and a decent workout. I‚Äôm 50+ but routinely zap the soy boys and mouthy biotches with great pleasure. Millennials cannot throw or catch even if they have trim bodies and the SPLAT of zinging a fatty put me in a wonderful mood. It won‚Äôt grow muscle but you end up not caring because of the laughter and schadenfreude.

                                I live in the core of a large US city (fiance/later wife diagnosed with medical issue, so no kids; we stayed behind after our friends moved away to raise families). It was likely easier for me to find league play.Search your area online for organized competition. Usually winter but try to firm up your play by mid-autumn at the latest. More rural or small suburban may have structured pick-up games through the YMCA/YWCA or comparable organizations, here we have formal dodgeball league play and social and professional leagues. Urban territory is more likely to insist on set teams, mostly right out of university spoiled brats, with a single ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù team comprised of the undesirables. After a season crushing it as garbage, the consistently winning teams will hit you up to join them when there is a vacancy.A problem with my affiliations and city is that after play you are expected to go out for beers together with the other team. This is painful for me because the Millennials who engage in childlike games such as dodgeball for the most part are superficial, vacuous imbeciles with noses buried in devices and cultural references I could care less about.I intend to continue playing once matches ensue because this takes me back to 5th or 6th grade and those were good years for me. Hope you find your way. Dodgeball!

                                I feel ya. We kids actually engaged in play, fantasy and mischief back in the day. No lcd screens. Every year or so some kid fell from the surprisingly tall ‚Äúmonkey bars‚Äù on the playground and broke an arm or something. There was a grove of pine trees densely planted as a firebreak near a ravine. We‚Äôd climb to the tops, rock the tree back and forth, and use them as a spring to the next tree. This way we‚Äôd spring across the grove end-to-end until we fell clutching branches and needles. And then get yelled at for all the pine resin gobbed all over us and our rummage sale clothes. So now here we are today.

                    The fans will be CGI before you know it.Literally ‚Äì they won‚Äôt tell you.Fake fans, just like as soon as the election is stolen and certified they‚Äôll have a fake vaccine suddenly available for Covid. The placebo will be almost entirely effective because they‚Äôll introduce very strict criteria for the diagnosis of Covid-19 which will be widely applied and the numbers will fall just at the right time.

                I recall, a few years ago, some fans were up in arms because they figured out that crowd sounds were being piped into the sportsball broadcasts.  I think it mattered back then, because people actually cared about their sports and their teams.  Now, everything is fake and people obviously don‚Äôt care at all.  They just ignore the whole thing.  The worm has turned, and the sports system, such as it is, hasn‚Äôt caught up yet.  If I were Jerry Jones, I would put the Cowboys up for sale, yesterday.

                Playing college basketball, the enthusiasm of your home crowd can buoy your spirits and push you to greater performance. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs the same with musicians at large concerts as well. There is no greater thrill than hitting a big three pointer that gets the crowd on their feet and yelling your name. A lot of players hated playing on the road, but I reveled in the hatred of the opposing fans. It also lifted my performances as I wanted to silence them. We were playing our conference rivals (I played in what would be termed a mid-major conference that sends its champion automatically to the NCAA Tournament) and we were making a run to put the game away. One of my teammates hit a timely three that sunk the crowd‚Äôs hopes and sent them to the exits. Since these fans were calling me every dirty name in the book, I couldn‚Äôt resist by shushing them as they turned to leave in disgust.Without that crowd, it just feels like a random pickup game with no purpose or meaning.We‚Äôre going to see a major change in sports because of this. The smaller schools won‚Äôt be able to maintain these massive athletic programs that also function as a conduit for vibrants on campus. Eliminating that in of itself would be a positive for the academic mission, which suffers since universities have become fever swamps for Marxist, white-hating whackjobs.
