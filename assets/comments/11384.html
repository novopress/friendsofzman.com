        Judgemental = you’re called judgemental when you’ve correctly deemed somebody to be a fucking loon you should keep well away from.

            I hate those people who go around saying “oh you’re judgemental”, in general they are the biggest a**holes and nutjobs around who have taken it upon themselves to police others.
They are very prevalent in upscale urban areas like Silicon Valley.
Most need a beat down.

            What’s funny about these Judge-O-Phobes is that if you complement them (on that which THEY value of course…watch out that you don’t complement them on what NORMAL people value!) they will puff up with  glee that you recognize their superior nature. However…you have just JUDGED them!  Because a Complement is simply a Judgement with a FAVORABLE Verdict! Therefore, when you hear some Prog railing against “Judgementalism” with much Prog Sanctimony, know that she is really BITCHING against being CRITICIZED!

            Thank you for the reminder. I’ve long taken “Don’t be so judgmental” to mean “Stop calling my attention to the fact that I’m being a self-centered asshole”.

            And here we are, 11 months later, and the president was just called “divisive” AGAIN today (well, to be truthful, some media personality AKA “analyst” called him “the most divisive president in history,” with the MSM’s typical lack of hyperbole, because the media person and his acquaintances do not like him as do most Americans, thereby making the president — not the media — “divisive.”)

        Voter Suppression:  (1) Ensuring that only people legally entitled to vote do vote.  (2)  Ensuring that dead people do not vote.  (3) Ensuring that each person votes no more than one ballot for a particular election.  (4) Requiring submittal of the same personal identification when a person votes as would be required for cashing a check.

        When I hear “that’s not who we are”, I hear Obama saying it with a sneer, in response to something that is affirming of America’s exceptionalism in some way.  I assume that “we”, in this case, means Barack and the mouse in his pocket.

        Sustainability – Someone publicly claiming a virtue at someone else’s expense. My wife and I met two young men in central Oregon who were bicycling cross country from NYC to California. They were big on espousing sustainability. They were recent college graduates in philosophy and geography so naturally they had nothing else to do. They were taking this 2 month adventure with donated funds, on $6000 bikes donated to them by a California bike shop. They even had a web site to tout their brave adventure with photos of their well-attended and celebrated departure from NYC. Come to find out they had gotten bored in Idaho, stopped for about a week until one of their fathers could drive from NYC to pick them up and transport them through Idaho into Oregon. So much for pedaling across the US. but the glory and attention had already been received.

            Oh, andHate Group:  More than one individual who is not a Democrat politician, member of the liberal media, and is not agreeing 100% with liberal religious ideology.  (Not to be confused with Enemy: Constitutional republican disagreeing with any alt-right precept and/or being mean at a convention.)White Supremacist:  1.) Anyone who believes all men are created equal. 2.) Anyone who reminds a liberal of any color (LoaC) that blacks owned slaves.  3.) Anyone who reminds a LoaC that Democrats were the primary slave owners and members of the KKK.  4.)  Anyone who reminds a LoaC that only 8% of whites in America owned slaves and that 200,000 whitey’s died to free those slaves, almost none of which owned slaves themselves.  5.) Anyone who reminds a LoaC that was 150 years ago and no one alive was a slave.  6.)  Anyone who reminds a LoaC that 40 acres an a mule were paid out to thousands of individuals, and transportation costs and political capital were paid out to establish the nation of Liberia, which has since been trashed by descendants of freed slaves.  7.)  Anyone who reminds a liberal of any color that a.) parts of affirmative action has been in place since 1865, and b.)  since 1961’s EO 10925 employers, especially liberal employers, have radically used this as a policy of reverse discrimination.  8)  Anyone who uses the term “reverse discrimination.”  Ok, this has gone on too long.  But I AM getting tired of every media report being prefaced with “White Supremacist” nowadays.

Sometimes I just say, you’re the one that made money on this transaction, donate a small portion for it. And yes, your fearless leaders will take all the credit and smile their pearlies as they take total credit while giving the cause that giant check.

        Agree re ‘sustainable’ being ridiculous, particularly in my part of the world.  There, actually sustainable living (using only local resources) year-round = a 10′ x 15′ log house with a sod roof set directly over the 10′ x 15′ barn.  Why over, you ask_?  Animal warmth goes up and animal excrement runs down, that’s why.Of course, the trustifarians who prattle on about sustainability have no actual idea what living without a cell phone would be like much less living without fossil fuels.  So I’d say that prattling is based more on ignorance than malice.To advocate sustainability out of malice would require knowledge of what it would actually require to live on only the readily available local resources, or better yet having tried it out for themselves.  Those that do try it out, even for a few days, (as in wilderness camping or hunting) know better.  For example, dog sledding is just a hobby now.  Real arctic dwellers only use snowmobiles in the winter and ATV’s in the summer .

                        Bile;If you are advocating for a non-biotic origin for terrestrial hydrocarbons (hard to tell, exactly), you may well be right.  And there is increasing evidence, such as you cite very briefly in passing, that you are.There are always a stubborn few geologists and geochemists who dare to question the conventional wisdom of the day and are later proved spectacularly right.  The history of the Theory of Continental Drift is People’s Exhibit A in this regard.The geology I studied in the ’60s was turned upside down when Continental Drift was vindicated some years later.  Now I’d be hard pressed to find any reference to the authorities of the ’60s who roundly denied it at the time, some of the likely still alive.Coincidentally, the ’60’s (and later) body of theory that denied Continental Drift also dogmatically supported the fossil origins of so-called ‘fossil fuels’.  FWIW, I recall the two main points of proof were that they had no better explanation and that plant fossils were found associated with coal deposits.  Anyone who dared say ‘association is not causation’ was denied tenure on the grounds that he could not convince TPTB that his obviously contrived explanation was better than their obviously contrived explanation(s).

        Sort of unrelated or meta related.It’s another great post but my eye was drawn to the bottom:This post has already been linked to 1827 times!Think about each one of these posts.  Thousands of links.  If even 0.1% links to someone unfamiliar with these ideas, think about that impact.  Two people a day are infected.  They go out and start subtly changing how they speak and think.  Maybe they return.  Maybe in time they get the courage to link it to someone else.  Think of the accumulated impact of that over time.  Even at a ridiculously low 0.1%.What has struck me is because the central claims are so obviously true, indeed most people already lie to themselves that they don’t hold them, the path to the alt right is a one way street.  No one ever goes back into the cave.That’s why progs are so scared.They have to win every day, every hour, every minute.  The dye is cast, the cat out of the bag.They’ve already lost.

        I call it linguistic distortion. Take a word or phrase that’s been around forever and whose meaning is a clear as day, and, overnight, change the meaning into something that is the opposite of what the whole world has understood and accepted since the beginning of time.
Take “reasonable,” which has always meant what it said, but now means “complelety devoid of reason.”

        Thoughts &amp; Prayers: A meaningless toss-away phrase that sounds good to a debased culture, used to fake spiritual piety and to fake that *you care*.  Unless one believes in voodoo, magic, etc., public “thoughts” expressed for the benefit of others are a waste of time and mental effort.  They’re yet more outwardly expressed internal dialog all about you: They do nothing for anyone else.Unless one believes in a powerful supernatural being who can hear your prayers and can act on them, invoking prayers is likewise useless virtue signaling.  However, to suppose that such a being might be motivated by the mere thoughts of those who casually invoke His Name is staggering presumption.

        I read an article about how Google was pressuring some “think tank” to defenestrate some individuals from its stable of tank-thinkers because they spoke unkindly of Google’s monopolistic business model.My shitty comment was to the effect that “think tanks” are not austere, lofty, transcendent bodies who formulate policy positions from an aeries of divine objectivity but, rather, seraglios populated by old whores of advanced corruption who peddle their asses to rich and powerful entities with an axe to grind – like, f’rinstance, Google.So “think tank”, although an old term, should be added to your Devil’s Dictionary because the devil is in the details that these bastards formulate.

        “Universal values” , Barry Soetoro Hussein Obama’s favorite phrase, is the biggest lie of all.Let’s see…forced clitoridectomy, strapping dynamite onto preteen girls with Down’s syndrome and sending them into populated areas to be detonated, shooting children in the back, routine mass beheadings, stoning rape victims to death, etc etc.Any politician invoking universal values is not only lying to you, he/she is your enemy.

After all, was not the Corporal in chief preoccupied also with monumental construction projects within Grossdeutschland, with conquest of the Slavs’ lands, and, like the American MIC, with the development of wonder weapons?

        Fantastic post. I actually wrote an award-winning humor book called THE ANGEL’S DICTIONARY (inspired by THE DEVIL’S DICTIONARY) on a similar wavelength. For a limited time, complimentary review copies are available on request athttp://www.crowrising.com/the-angels-dictionary… Thanks for letting me share this info with your readers.

        Liberaln.a Prog devoted to the establishment of totalitarian, secular, humanist internationalism through the popularity contests and log rolling of electoral politics. The liberal often believes that capitalism has many decades of useful work to do, esp. if it entails in the meantime—for Progs—lifestyles which (that?) are commensurate with incomes far above the median income. Thus our liberal is a sybarite who supports the exact opposite of the freedom implied by the Latin word from which liberal is derived.
