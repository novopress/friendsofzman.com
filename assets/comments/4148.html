        Heard him today on the Mike Gallagher show and he said the first thing he would do upon entering office, if elected, would be to undo all of Obama’s unconstitutional acts.  Also said he would repeal every word of Obamacare.  If true, those are fighting words.  Anyone who hasn’t looked up his resume please do.  He is one smart cookie.  Don’t know if he would make a good president but he would truly be “the smartest man in the room.”   If debates won elections he would be a shoe-in.

        I am an admirer of Ted Cruz, I voted for him in his Senatorial run, and will again. I would rather he stay in the Senate than be President, but I like the idea that he’s running because he scares the SHIT out of so many people who desperately need the shit scared out of them.

I don’t think senators should be running for President, but Cruz will shift the debate in a favorable direction. Of course, he could just be a straw for Jeb. Cruz can draw votes from Walker opening the door for Jeb. The reward will be the VP slot for Cruz.

        Realistically, once you are in you don’t want any more outsiders arriving to take what you have just got.
Just as realistically if you have been in a place for years and years and years you still don’t want any more outsiders arriving. I suppose journalists working on papers like the NYT will start to agree with this when Manuel starts to do the job instead of them.

        “The fact is, most Hispanics agree with Cruz on immigration. Open borders and illegal immigration are bad for them. Talk to any legal immigrant and they will chew your ear off about the evils of amnesty and illegal immigration.”Not really.  Yes, according to that survey, slim Hispanic majorities agree with Republicans on open borders and further illegal immigration, as well as on allowing illegals to receive gov’t benefits.  But on the key issue of amnesty there is a vast divide:“Hispanic adults and voters strongly support immigration reform. Support for immigration reform is almost universal and fundamental.  • More than four in five Hispanics, 86%, support immigration reform in the United States. Two-thirds, 64%, strongly support and only 8% oppose. • More than four in five, 85%, support granting legal status to undocumented immigrants who live here. Two-thirds, 63%, strongly support and only 11% oppose. • Nine in ten, 90%, support giving undocumented immigrants a way to become U.S. citizens. Two-thirds, 66% strongly support and only 8% oppose.”Also, Hispanics hate Republicans, because they are racists:“Among all Hispanic adults two in three, 65%, believe that the Republican Party discriminates against Latinos and Hispanics. Only 22% said no and 13% didn’t know….When asked if they thought that “Republicans want to stop immigration because they don’t want more Latinos or Hispanics to come to the U.S.”, almost two-thirds of all Hispanic adults, 62%, said yes. Only 27% said no and 11% didn’t know.”Cruz’s stated position is strong border security, stop the flow of illegals, allow legalization of those already in the country.  He’s not for citizenship but that’s an easy feint; we all know that with legalization comes citizenship at some point.Cruz is the best friend the undocumented community ever had; they just don’t know it yet.

            The thing about the feared Hispanic backlash is Hispanics don’t vote in numbers to make it an issue. Those that support amnesty are already voting lunatic. Those that don’t are well on their way to checking the box that reads “Caucasian” on their government forms. That’s another thing forgotten. Most Hispanics would gladly align white if given the chance.
I’m not as fearful of the Hispanic wave as I look at them as late arriving Italians. It’s just that we need to stem the tide and make sure the loafers are not coming here.

            I guess the problem is once you bring in some immigrants, more will always follow, legal or not.

        Make no mistake, the Manchurian Conservative is pro-Amnesty.  He’s just smart enough to realize that it makes no sense to pass it while Obama is in office, and let the D’s get the credit.
He also is smart enough to know that the base opposes amnesty, so why shoot yourself in the foot by trying to enlighten it?  Better to have a “Nixon Goes to China” moment after he’s safely elected.
I’m sure that’s what he’s telling the members of the donor class who are willing to take his phone calls.

        I was a half-Mexican kid living in E.L.A., when Congress and Nixon opened the illegal immigration floodgates.  None of my latino peers were happy about living through those times.  You think it was bad watching on the TV or from the occasional field trip to Olvera St?  Think what it was like getting washed over by that flood.
