        “This means any deal is akin to Neville Chamberlain ceding the Sudetenland.”The idea that Chamberlain was some kind of weak liberal pansy appeaser is one of the greatest lies of the past century.Chamberlain was a Conservative and he did the right thing by ceding the Sudetenland. Britain, which lost 750,000 men on the continent only 20 years earlier, had absolutely no way to enforce Czechoslovakian borders deep in Central Europe and had no national interest in those borders. Moreover, those borders were an utter farce, in violation of the Wilsonian/League of Nations principle of “ethnic self-determination of peoples” articulated at Versailles.As Bad Mustache man correctly pointed out, Wilson was a liar; he claimed to be in favor of “ethnic self-determination” for everyone — but the Germans.In 1938, Chamberlain met with a fellow democratically-elected leader to end the lie that Czechoslovakia was a real country (hell, the Czechs and the Slovaks went their own separate ways in 1992 anyway) and that Britain and the League of Nations had an obligation to maintain the borders that kept five million Sudetendeutsch under foreign rule.What’s not to like?When Chamberlain reversed course and decided to declare war on Germany to enforce the Polish Corridor and the isolated German city of Danzig, he got his ass kicked. Hitler could have easily slaughtered the entire BEF at Dunkirk. (Why didn’t he? Good question. I don’t know).The fact that the neocons are still citing “Chamberlain at Munich” as justification for foreign interventions in 2024 is simply breathtaking in its stupidity and absurdity.

            An excellent analysis and summary. I wonder if Chamberlain will be rehabilitated as the skepticism around Churchill grows. The Brits were huge losers in WWII and are finally figuring it out after 75 years.

                There is a stupidity crisis in Britain. I doubt if there are enough intelligent, ethical, courageous Brits around to make any headway.

                “The Brits were huge losers in WWII and are finally figuring it out after 75 years.”
This is projection by a Merkin:61% of your population is white.You’ve been chased out from all your major cities, and now you flee the suburbs. Your country’s done. Still, as some pathetic mental security blanket you hold on to the desire that the “Brits” are going to be eradicated before your precious constitution.

                    There’s plenty of blame to go ’round. Very few Western nations, and none in the anglosphere, have covered themselves in glory since WWI.

                        If I didn’t know better, I would say the “le 56%” meme, which this inane comment is a variant of, and which is parroted around a lot of “dissident” websites hundreds of times a day,  was hatched in Langley and Tel Aviv to sow division between Americans and Europeans to keep us from recognizing our common adversary.

                    Ackshually, Merka is more accurately 55% White (58.9% officially).  And many of us hardly glory in England’s current sad state.  I, personally, feel great warmth and affection for England’s people and unparalleled admiration for your history and culture.  Hint – no need to get one’s knickers in a twist about long overdue reconsideration of lies we were taught as truth.

                    I see that Traditionalist Right sites are starting to pick up trolls since the election. This is good and bad. It means that eyes are upon us in a new way and it means that we may not be able to enjoy these types of comment sections free of trolls.As for the good General here, I don’t know of anyone in these spheres who want to see Britain eradicated. This is also the first time I have seen someone in this comment section being gleeful that Americans are heading for eradication in the subtext of a comment. It is likely that Britain will not get out of its existential morass without Yankee sympathy and help nor Americans get through to whatever is next without British empathy and support. This kind of sentiment and nihilistic glee is toxic and destructive.We welcome cogent and interesting thought around here, but have typically not been amenable to this kind of infantile and petty sentiment. In other words, the end zone dance is not a part of our culture. We take more of a Vince Lombardi approach to things which is to say as he did, “When you get to the end zone, act like you’ve been there before.”

We’re all in the same boat. The difference between the USA and Europe is that the USA got the slow walk version of it starting in the 1950s while Europe has been getting swamped for only 10-20 years. Canada too.

            Maybe Germany had some valid points for WWII when after WWI they:Were stripped of all their overseas coloniesLost about 1/3 of their prewar bordersLost several million German citizens who were relocated into newly created counties where they were treated badlyHad to accept TOTAL GUILT for the outbreak of WWIEtc. Everyone knows the “if only Chamberlain had done this” narrative; it’s powerful propaganda and the lynchpin of every major US military adventure abroad since.Couple that with the “Kick the dog until it bites, then shoot it” school of foreign policy along with incessant “good v evil” narrative US warmongering is especially odious.War is just national policy with defined (or not) objectives.

                The horrific Versailles settlement that was imposed on Germany after WW1 is always conveniently left out of Western history books.
Versailles was so one-sided and vengeful that it virtually guaranteed the creation of a mustache man in Germany.

            Chamberlain and Churchill knew that Britain wasn’t strong enough to defeat Nazi Germany by itself. The difference was that Chamberlain felt an agreement could be reached (even an interim one would give Britain time to build up its military – something Churchill had been pushing for years while out of power), while Churchill realized that the choices were either submit to Hitler or fight to the death, and he favored earlier intervention with French help. Everyone – even Hitler – was surprised by the rapid fall of France.

                Churchill – what a monster. neither of those choices is true. He took the devils ticket, and did their bidding. Dresden, a true holocaust make those devils dance with delight. Burning and murdering refugees seems to be theme for the satan worshipers, creating a war of White against White to further the destruction of Western Christendom and make the world safe for the international diaspora.Anthony Sutton published much documentation in re the financing of Hitler’s war machine buildup- with the help of Prescott Bush, the father of our first President Bush. such a cohencidence.As Ron Unz has written, nearly everything we think we know about those days is a lie.Now we stand on the brink of another war at the behest of the evil tribe. Perhaps those evil Rooskis will be more lenient when our Versailles moment comes around.

                    Levels of cluelessness about WW2, Hitler, and Europe that barely seem possible. Hitler was maximalist – nobody can argue with that. If the Royal Navy – in addition to the French and Italian navies – had fallen into his hands it would have been a game-changer.Dresden was an Allied atrocity (and Allied command tried to keep such atrocities from the public, who they knew would disapprove), absolutely no excuses. Atrocities were committed on all sides.The Russians’ view of Hitler is correct, however. He dragged Europe into the abyss. Instead of being a bulwark against Bolshevism, Germany ended up bringing the conquering armies of the USSR into the heart of Europe!

            Hitler did everything in his power to avoid war with Britain. He made many public and private pronouncements that he saw Britain as a kindred spirit and greatly admired them.I believe he allowed the expeditionary force to get back to Britain as a show of good faith, that this would be regarded as honorable. He falsely believed once Britain was forced off the continent that she would want peace.  But Churchill was a bloodthirsty warmonger. He tied Britain to the single worst leader Europe has ever seen.  The supposedly staunchly anti-communist Churchill got together with Stalin and later signed away the sovereignty of Poland he was supposedly defending.

                Hitler’s declaration of war on America was beyond stupid.
Standout stupid among a myriad of stupid decisions (unlike leaders in the USA or Britain, he had no pushback). Stalin also made stupid decisions (like trusting Hitler’s word on the eve of Barbarossa!). Again, no pushback from those around him as he was a dictator.

                    I agree it was a dumb move, but Hitler really didn’t have much of a choice. America was supplying millions of tons of material support to the Soviet Union and Britain.  The only way Hitler could slow that down was by using the U-boats to sink ships.  While it was initially very successful, the British and American navies figured out how to neutralize the U-boats.When it comes to Stalin/Hitler and who was dumb, that was clearly Hitler.  The Soviets built a massive army and was in forward positions all along the front at the time Barbarossa.  This was one of the reasons Barbarossa was so successful initially.  They were not in dug in defensive positions.You need to stop watching cartoons.  The Wehrmacht and factions of the government were always doing things behind Hitler’s back. Hitler personally ordered a group of Italian Jews not be “liquidated” and they were liquidated anyway against his wishes.There are always factions. President Xi has factions warring against him.  While Stalin seems to have had near total control of the Soviet Union, that came at a huge cost and evaporated with Stalin’s death. Khrushchev never had this kind of iron-fist control of the state nor did Mao nor did Mussolini nor did Franco.Just FYI… I’m not a fan of Hitler or the Nazis in general.  They brought complete and utter destruction to their country.  But they were not the cartoon mustache twirling villains they are painted to be in the modern day or even at the time.

            A brief dissent.  The Treaty of Versailles awarded the Sudetenland to Czechoslovakia in order to give it defensible frontiers.  The Sudentenland is fairly mountainous and the Czechs had built some fairly formidable fortifications.  A successful German attack into Czechslovakia would not have been a sure thing, particularly if France and Great Britain put pressure on Germany’s western borders, although these too had formidable fortifications. The Germans showed their true hand later in 1938 when they occupied Bohemia and Moravia and installed a puppet government in Slovakia.  To be sure, Poland demanded and received a portion of the former Csechslovakia.  I don’t think that Chamberlain simply caved, but a firmer stance might have resulted in a failed German attack in Czechoslovakia, and changed the European portion of World War II fundamentally.

            “Chamberlain? You could hold his head in the toilet and he’d still give you half of Europe!”But seriously, the fix was in.  The option of not having WWII, like say Oswald Mosely wanted, would not be allowed.  And those who wanted to avoid a giant war with millions dead are called appeasers or Nazi sympathizers or somesuch.  Because everyone knows Adolf wanted to take over the world and be very, very, VERY mean to people!

                I’m no Hitler expert, but I don’t think he had any additional “problems” that needed solving after Poland.  Poland really was a problem which needed solving and the Poles absolutely refused to even negotiate.  Ethnic Germans were being oppressed and even murdered.  Without British and French meddling, these probably could have been resolved.

                    The Poles wanted the German port city of Konigsberg. The Germans spent nearly two decades of diplomacy trying to get land access to Prussia (the coastal access corridor was populated with Germans, not Poles) and try to get the Poles onboard in an alliance against the JudeoBolshevism of the Soviet Union. The Poles decided in the end that they wanted the land more than they hated Russians, which is really something.The Germans eventually decided that the JudeoBolsheviks were simply too great a threat for further patience to be extended to blockhead Poles. The German perspective imo is that not only were the Poles being wildly unreasonable, but that they were standing in the way of effective defense of European civilization against the existential threat of JudeoBolshevism, so the former steamrolled the latter. Given what is happening to European civilization, I’d say they were spot on, even if the eventual victorious destroyers came from the west, not the east.This is similar to the process Sergei Lavrov of the Russian Federation shepherded since 2014 trying to find a solution to the problem of Ukrainians, backed by International Jews, attacking ethnic Russians and Russophilic and Russophonic Ukrainians (who are Rus, like the Great Russians). It only takes one side to start a war, and when diplomacy fails to remediate an existential threat, one has no choice but to get down to the killing.

            World War II is framed in terms of a morality play (the only way it could be framed for the war criminals who won it), so any negotiation or reasonable discussion is post-hoc framed as weakness or capitulation. And it is why the warmongers and war criminals still bring it up. It is why it is so dangerous and plays into their hands (for example the Biden entity doesn’t even pretend to talk to Moscow). Yet, I think that this is reaching the end of its useful period – it’s just become downright cartoonish, and the manipulation was obvious with Ukraine. Nobody is really buying it anymore, and the people who fought Germany are mostly dead.

                            Yes, but those fingers in the middle east pie would be in the form of working with them to bring their petroleum to market, not in wasting $trillions blowing up their countries.  The wars are for Israel.  Further, with fracking we can be self sufficient in a way we could not in the 1970s.

        the Kagan’s ancient enemy to the east
Their ancient enemy includes Ukraine. That’s why they have no qualms about sending masses of Ukrainian men to their deaths.
Polaks and other Slavs are also their enemies. Actually, all Europeans are their enemies, including their most faithful lapdogs in the UK.

        A ground war with Iran is pretty much impossible, both logistically and in terms of men under arms(which includes a lot of women and trannies who are mostly useless)…Given the vulnerability of our carriers,  an air war doesn’t look much better, and Iran’s Russia-enhanced air defenses are formidable..And then there’s the problem of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, promising economic disaster…So the neocons are pretty much stuck with the Ukraine project, which has produced no results despite draining NATO dry of military resources…It doesn’t seem that Trump has much to worry about…He can just get a couple of meaningless concessions from Putin at the end, and all is beautiful….

            Yep. Trump’s foreign policy will be constrained by the new reality that the US is no longer the global hegemon. Our military remains the best in terms of global reach, but other big players can now punch back if we strike at them. This dramatically changes the equation.
Trump is fully onboard the Israel First team, but we can’t hit Iran hard enough to stop them from hitting back hard against Israel and our navy. Trump doesn’t want that to be his legacy.

        Admirably lucid analysis of the Ukr situation.After that I think it gets over-complicated, which I think is due to the fact that there are several and interlocking agendas – One of which (and at the highest level IMO) is simply to embroil the US in as many – as destructive as possible – and unwinnable  – wars; with the objective of destroying the USA.Of course, there is power to be gained and money to be made along the way; but most of the dominant policies share the result of weakening, and ultimately destroying, the USA.This is how multiple global wars fit with long term policies such as open borders, privileging immigrants over natives, destroying the economy by climate legislation, destroying social functionality by affirmative action etc etc.It explains why the US is being corralled into a three-fronts (at least) war with the other superpowers; while the US military is itself being crippled and wound-down.US destruction would be guaranteed – with massive collateral damage “everywhere” else as a bonus.The whole thing amounts to a decades long strategic and purposive annihilation of the USA as a viable entity… And annihilation of the West in general, but the US most of all.

            Yes.  The real war is against the U.S. citizenry.  By sending manufacturing overseas, the rich have gutted the military-industrial complex and left the nation with merely a war-economy.

        The problem is they’re not fooling anybody.  It’s pretty obvious what they’re doing.The regime lost decisively in an election where Trump promised to end the Ukraine war and the boozy bimbo refused to talk about it.  Trump has a popular mandate, despite the protestations of a permanent government that might be DOGE’d into submission.  He is openly derisive of the State Dept negotiators, frequently calling them “stupid” and “incompetent”.  So I don’t think Rubio can break through that noise.  He probably picked Rubio specifically because Rubio isn’t all that bright.Expect a lot of “we can’t abandon our allies” talk from the usual suspects.  But they all endorsed Harris: advantage Trump.  Language like that was used to try and get us involved against Russia in the Syrian Civil War.  It had no effect on Trump who continued the drawdown.Trump seems to be doing the good cop bad cop thing with his foreign policy team.  He gets to be the one holding the rabid war dogs at bay.I think the best thing he could do is simply release a statement that basically says, “You might not want to take those missiles out of the shipping crates because it’ll be expensive to ship them all back in January.  Defense contractors found to be involved in this scheme will not be doing business with the government while I’m President.”Spring the trap.  The public has his back.  The propaganda reporting about the missiles plays to his advantage.  Nobody gives a shit that there’s a “policy” to only use the missiles inside Ukraine.  Most people hearing about that arms deal will correctly assume that the “200 mile” restriction is arbitrary and that the missiles could make a fantastic terror weapon.Plus, when Ukraine collapses, the Russians will capture billions in US weapons.  Including those missiles.

                I think the public will be just fine with career scumbags having their clearances yanked.
In fact, the whole, “security clearance as ongoing professional courtesy,” system never should have begun.
This is because it is the direct antithesis of the principles of compartmentalization and, “need to know,” that the intelligence establishment claims are the bedrock principles of securing information.
The access this system enables is a huge threat to national security and our Constitutional Republic.
Like Alinsky says, “make them live up to their own rules.”

        Timing this escalation right after the Trump victory is very suspicious, but typical of corrupt D.C.
It was an unwinnable war from the get-go, and each day it becomes less winnable as silly empowered women and celebrated homos take over the military.  Soon America won’t be fit to defeat Guatemala.

        For as long as I remember, outgoing Presidents just do not enact these sorts of major policy changes that could have potentially massive implications for the next president. This norm, by the way, also applies to things far less consequential than this. This is for obvious reasons, as it upsets the spirit of the “peaceful transfer of power” that they claim to hold so dear. But as usual, the Brandon administration broke another norm, with the cover of the media – CNN was practically gloating about the mess it will leave Trump to untangle, and the potential it has to destroy his plan for unwinding this war.Broadly speaking, I think this is how the regime is going to deal with Trump. They’re going to accelerate the wars, they’re going to start printting the real economic numbers, they’re just going to keep him on his back foot instead of implementing his agenda.

            Fortunately, Trump is tougher than a 10-dollar sirloin. He can take it. In fact, the man fairly thrives on stress, pressure and conflict. The difficult part will be confuting the various subterfuges that will be worked against him. It won’t be easy. But he’s got experience, and he’s going into this thing with his eyes wide open, I think.

                It’s not Trump I am worried about, it is the idea that he walks into the White House on January 21 with WW3 on his hands. These people have more than two months to cause all sorts of chaos. Last time around they used this time to engineer the Russia hoax and prosecute General Flynn for talking to his foreign counterpart.

        Z is leaving out the Pentagon in this equation. Trump will be the first president of Regional American Empire. The US can no longer punch without getting punched back, at least against the main players.
The Pentagon is likely aware that an attack on Iran means counter attacks and not just closing off the Strait of Hormuz but missile attacks against American ships or installations. As in Ukraine, pretty narratives fall apart against cold reality.

            They haven’t even really punched back yet.  Putin, Xi and the mullahs have been the restrained adults in the room.

                It is almost as if shipping almost all of the collective West’s industrial base to Asia, then turning around and hamstringing itself with ludicrous environmental regulations made any sanctions threat entirely moot.
Then you have the West’s childish lack of diplomacy that only encourages 3rd party nations to serve as re-exporters to say, Russia, at an entirely reasonable markup. The end result is a bunch of MSM articles whining about Western chips showing up in Russian missiles.

            The interior of the US is wide open, and Iran, China, and Russia know it. Any regional war will involved massed sabotage on US soil, both in physical form, and via hacking, and it will cause so much chaos at home that engaged US forces will not get logistical support for weeks, if not months.

        I wouldn’t get too excited.Putler just has too many good options. He can literally throw up a blockade around the Kraine where nothing goes in without his say-so first. He could blow away Zelenski any time he wants. There are any number of terrorists right here in North America that can be unleashed with a phone call.Or he could play it sly too: don’t be surprised if Iran soon has long range precision weapons. I note with wry amusement that Bibi Netenyahu had some bombs fall in VERY close proximity to his house in Israel – and had a window blown out. Maybe the next one will land in his shorts…? Maybe a US carrier gets smoked by some exotic foreign weirdos  called “Hooties”?The Russians know the game and who they’re dealing with.

        Trump needs to avoid the Nixon “peace with honor” Vietnam pitfall and just end the Ukraine thing asap. Just about any peace deal is preferable to prolonging this losing situation. I think Trump and his people are smart enough to get this. The Iran thing is what worries me more. We have created a huge incentive for all our “enemies” to acquire nuclear weapons (after Hussein, Khaddafi et al didn’t). Hypersonic delivery systems and simple drones could deliver devastating attacks now. The world has changed. Our financial hegemony is a bigger weapon than our military these days.

            Spot on.   If Trump gets too close to Ukraine it will stick to him like tar and it will be the effective end of his administration.  The neocons will make sure of that.   He needs to just walk away.The Iran situation is, as you say, the more worrisome.    Trump is a Zionist.  He does not try to hide it.     If the U.S. gets into any protracted war with Iran it will be a disaster for the U.S.   Yet that is why Trump was allowed to win.   The expectation from the Tribe is that Trump goes to war with Iran.   It will be telling  to see how he handles that.

        I think Russia has anticipated all of this and already planned for it. And no, they will not take the bait and start WW3. Ukraine is now facing a dark winter and that hardship may be the final straw that breaks the camels back. Civil unrest combined with a mutiny in the AFU could well topple Zelensky before Jan 20th. Attrition and exodus will further depopulate Ukraine and force Russia to accelerate ending of the war via the battlefield. This will cost them many more soldier’s lives and make capitulation the only feasible resolution.

        Putin is proof that a cool, rational man is at a serious disadvantage in a game of chicken. He should have tried Nixon s crazy man strategy. But now it might be too late. The others, ostensibly “our side”, are too high on their chicken shit supply. And two crazies playing chicken will end very badly

        OT:  Is anyone else irked by Lil Marco being the pick for Sec. of State?
I can live with the rest of the picks so far, but this one sits in my craw.  Heck, I’d prefer Lyin Ted be the pick instead.  Just how that little guy looks really rubs me the wrong way.

        Trump may find it more difficult to extricate himself from Ukraine than he imagines. They will use his insecure ego against him, which is his tragic flaw. He simply will not want to take the L, and any peace deal will be portrayed as such. Putin will reject Trump’s “beautiful deal” and Trump will get mad and escalate.Meanwhile, the neocons will draft off their Zionist cousins and provoke Russia in Syria, which will be targeted as a proxy of Iran. War with Russia anywhere means war with Russia everywhere, and that is their objective. One way is as good as another.Russia should go for the knockout now, and present Trump with a fait accompli.

        If The American military is truly making strategic decisions in Ukraine, for the sake of the loe level personal in the US armed forces, we better not go to war with anyone above stone age level tech, as we keep making the same stupid mistake of initiating an offense, then creating a salient which the Russians pound into oblivion.

Nobody has any historical sense of why the Russians might be wary of aggressive neighbors to the west.

        It is possible that Slow Joe just took the Chamberlain scenario off the table. Following the “peaceful transition” White House meeting, Trump could be excused for interpreting this action as treachery. It thus makes it a whole lot easier to agree to Russia’s terms and blame it on Biden, thus ending the war ASAP.

            I disagree. They can still lower the draft age and fall back to the Dneiper, which would be a formidable defense line. This would drag the war out considerably. It would also present the Russians with a very bad decision. They could say, “we’ve achieved our objective and liberated ethnic Russian lands and created a buffer.” However, that rump state would be a thorn, the azov guys would still be there, and NATO would certainly start stocking them up again. However, if they push and invade western Ukraine, they face the difficulty of crossing the Dneiper, along with highly likely guerrilla warfare. Western Ukraine is where all the nationalists are from. They’re caught between a rock and a hard place at that point, and I don’t know what the answer is.

                What the frick is wrong with you ? doesn’t life have any meanintg to you? This is anot a video game . I don’t know where you are getting this Neocon wet dream but it’s a joke . . So after getting 800000 obstenably Christian  men  killed , the answer is getting half a million more teenagers killed is a good answer.?  the idea that NATO has ANYTHING left to stock them up with is pure fantasy. the warehouses have been empty for a year, artillery shells go straight from the factory production line to the shipping dock now.  And How do you expect to train these new 18 yr old draftees? sending raw untrained draftees to face a battle hardened  experienced professional army is not generally a winning strategy.. Azof is Gone, the last of them are being killed in Kursk as we type. this type of thinking led to WW 1 lasting 4 years and the flower of European youth being killed off on ALL sides.

                    You misread my reply quite emotionally. I didn’t claim it was moral, or that it’s what I want or desired. You iterated that the army will collapse by January. I simply disagree that this will happen. If any real collapse happens, they’ll fall back (if they have any brains) to the Dneiper and hold that line. I’m sure they already have something built there in case that happens. The Europeans and those in charge in Ukraine will not give up, and I’m stating the fact that they do have the ability to hold out much longer. NATO won’t “run out” of shells, just as people talking about Russia running out was silly. They’ll just produce less than Russia, and Ukraine will continue to get out gunned. That’s simply the reality of the situation.

        Sorry if this is a spammish post. Someone mentioned this guy so I pulled his wiki. Check out the coherency of this. It is a microcosm of the world The Regime is trying to build:”Mehdi Raza Hasan(/ˈmɛdi ˈhʌsən/MED-ee HUSS-ən; born July 1979)[1][2][3]is aBritish–Americanprogressivebroadcaster and writerHasan was born inSwindontoIndian Shia Muslimparents from the city ofHyderabadinAndhra Pradesh(now inTelangana).[15][16][17]Hasan was privately educated atMerchant Taylors’ School, Northwood, a day independent school for boys at Sandy Lodge in theThree Rivers DistrictofHertfordshire, near the town ofNorthwoodin North West London.[18]Hasan and British actor and rapperRiz Ahmedwere schoolmates.[19]Hasan then attendedChrist Church, Oxford, where he readPhilosophy, Politics and Economics(PPE),[18]and graduated in 2000.”When we unite as a single pan-European people, we will be unstoppable. This is the ultimate goal, and probably the only path forward for the survival of our people. This will cross generations. First step is to do this in post-America.A strong lesson from this wiki bio is you can never allow foreign elites in as citizens and equals and give them access to your institutions. Look at the pedigree of his education but he didn’t assimilate. Of course, he had zero incentive to assimilate. Full access was handed to him so he didn’t have to in order to rise.Rinse and repeat this story across every ethnic group that Western civilization opened its societies to.

            He’s fully assimilated to “PPE,” i.e., the regime—actual British culture, now that the people have been defeated.
Remember the tory schism over PPE a few years ago? Basically because a bunch of prominent British conservatives’ wives are PPE girls, they went completely batshit defending the institution—and all of globohomo along with it—against the Trumpist Brexit white supremacists or whatever. (It might have been pre-Trump, but opposition to him preceded/invented him.)
It was very like their recent tantrum for Churchill—who, like PPE,iscivilization—against the NAZI APOLOGISTS. Almost all the same people.

        There is a lot to digest and understand from this days old interview of Weiss and Thiel. Given Thiel’s role and place in the oligarchy any political actor or commentator should take some time to digest it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJV_NuN43YHe addresses today’s topic head on. This oligarchy has completely ceded Iran as enemy number one and “partnering” with Israel on preventing it from getting nukes. There is a lot of equivocation on many topics, but the subtext and the desire to equivocate is promising on domestic issues.Note also his stated means of killing off the Blue patronage network. He advocates for just letting it go bankrupt. If you are in a city, and Trump decides to take that path, get out of the blast radius or have a plan to get out of it as safely as possible. A lot of money was transferred to BRA during the Covid financial bailout, and taking it away is going to turn people to their natural state of savagery.Here is a snippet from an interview a year earlier where Thiel does less equivocating, putting more of his cards on the table:https://youtu.be/4m9N2ikt_iIStill the view and the concern is always about technology and not about people and civilization. Nonetheless … there is something to work with there.Our role is to both hammer the admin on mass deportation as angry hornets and to reward and support them when the media attacks the project. Mass Deportation and ending the ethnic cleansing of the military should be the things we push on with highly coordinated and organized energy when we engage in politics.For the rest, building networks and remote redoubts should be priority number one. It is great to hear that so many new people have joined and that the energy is sky high.

            I agree with everything you said, except I would leapfrog over “ending the ethnic cleansing of the military” and gut it by 70%.  When was the last time our military defended our own country?  The War of 1812?  We have 400 million private firearms in the U.S., which is more than all the world’s militaries combined.  No country is going to invade us.  The $900 billion pentagon budget is 100% for NATO, not for for us.

                I understand the emotion behind the comment DLS. However, we need to cool our heads. First of all the predicament we find ourselves in is tricky.If we stay in the military we risk continuing to be cannon fodder for wars that are contrary to American’s interests. If we leave entirely as a quiet quit, then we cede the full might and force of the empire and the pets they are replacing us with.Joe Biden’s threat was very well thought through. AR-15s are no defense against high altitude bombers, fighter jets, tanks, rockets, missiles … … That doesn’t even account for who controls the keys to the kingdom – the nuclear arsenal. Americans may have a lot of guns and ammo, but the government has control of the supply chains. What happens whenthe ammo runs out and equipment can’t get replaced?The guns won’t do much good in that case. They are a very important tool in defense against the breakdown of the society – self-defense; vigilantism to combat anarcho tyranny; deterring mass raids … …Trump’s election represents a massive opportunity to recapture the all important castle of the military. Trump does not want war. The American people aren’t up for it. Right now the GAE goes about and gets laughed at by rivals in negotiations. They sit across the table from people who know the GAE is undertaking a color revolution, has declared open war on its heritage/patriot population and is struggling to fill the military. This gives it a very weak hand as Ukraine is now a rout.It is likely that Trump comes in and strengthens the hand by getting white men and our threat of white boy warrior magic to get back on side. This gives him a better hand to play internationally. It is also a chance to build a rival castle that is deeply threatening to The Regime. If he really is smart, he will invite in young heritage Americans to fight the new and real war – mass deportation and rooting out the cartels. This would give young White men a great opportunity to rise to the ranks by proving themselves. It would also be a deeply patriotic and passionate project to restore Our people as the rightful sovereign in North America. He would build a castle and seed a deep comeraderie amongst Our young men who would also form the generals and lieutenants that will be needed as we move through post-America toward whatever we can reconstitute of once-America and Western Civilization.Were Trump not in, and the regime pushed it with Ukraine and Iran in a land war, there would be an opportunity for mass mutiny that would end the empire overnight. White men are not organized enough to pull that off. You would need a mass white man mutiny and it would need the luck of not being able to conscript the replacement-invaders successfully for this to be an option.I hope Trump has this kind of strategic thinkers on his side. This is not about 4 years but about the next 2 centuries. This election represents a chance to re-enfranchise American men and make them a rival castle in the most critical institution in regards to real political power.

                    I go back and forth on whether I want to rebuild the whiteness of the military.  Typically the military, as with all LEOs as well, will follow orders and protect their pensions, even if they serve a tyrannical leftist regime.  I would rather rebel against Rachel Levine than Rob O’Neill.  But either path is better with a much smaller military.

        My guess is that the Ukraine war will continue relatively unabated after Trump enters office. Israel will ensure that they get first pick of weapons and funds, but, with what’s left over, their US Gov servants will continue the Ukraine war full on. The war against Russia is being sustained on behalf of Jews’ financial interests (Larry Fink, Mihail Khodorkovsky, Bill Browder, Wall Street in general, etc) and to punish Russia for supporting Iran and Assad against Israel.Trump’s instincts are obviously in some ways Mearsheimer-ish, but he is also Boomer philosemetic.  More to the point, my guess is that Israel told him a year ago, “If you stand against our wars, you will die in jail (if we don’t JFK you first), but if you hand over US foreign policy to us, you will be allowed to be president and get revenge on your domestic enemies.” That’s why we are seeing such a bifurcation between the awesome incoming Trump domestic cabinet picks, on the one hand, and the atrocious foreign policy cabinet appointments that have been made by Netanyahu on the other.

        Not to go all “4D chess”, but there is a possibility that with both Iran and Russia, Trump can position himself, personally, as a moderate in a sea of crazies.  Allow the aggressive warmongers to take their positions to set the baselines, and then let Trump find some negotiating wiggle-room to strike deals.  It’s a needle-threading exercise, but isn’t international relations when things are a bit edgy always so?

            Agree in principle, but it’s a tall order. I’m reminded of the children’s story of the mice agreeing that a bell need to be placed on the cat.

        Neo-cons should go up against the wall, in a real and literal sense. It is the only way they seem to learn, and for some, not even then.

        Coincidentally, this is the standard operating procedure for Israel.
Even when reading this without knowing the full context my brain automatically wrote “cohencidence”, which seems to be the only type of geopolitical coincidence we have at the moment.
He will inherit a foreign policy establishment that is hopelessly corrupt.
It goes along with the rest of the system which is hopelessly corrupt.  The best Trump can do is stave off disaster for four years, which, wouldn’t be a small achievement.

        Instead of “the neocons and the Israel lobby” it should have read neocons/Israel lobby.   Every individual that supports the Ukrainian side in the war, supports Israel.   Almost, but not entirely everyone that supports Israeli wars, supports Ukraine.  The term “neocon” has gotten stale though but there isn’t much out there to replace it.  “Israeli Firster that likes to see the US in wars, especially against Russia” doesn’t have the same ring.

        &gt;Despite the lie machine saying otherwise, the latest escalation is limited to the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an ill-fated attack inside Russia.
Apparently, Zelenskystein’s military just hit the Bryansk region with the ATACMS, so it’s NOT limited to Kursk. Based on their own doctrine, the Russians should now nuke somebody.I think they will wait for Trump instead and punish Zelenskystein in some other way.

        Including nuclear, chemical or biological. Those last two officially do not exist, but they do exist, and Russia knows it.
Do China and Russia also have those? We don’t know it.

        Trump’s silence on the Ukraine issue stems from a number of likely factors: (1) He is enjoying his last days as a private citizen, demurring when pressed to work ahead of time; (2) He recognizes that the Power of the Deal is contingent upon a certain amount of mystery and confusion about one’s true powers and motives; (3) He doesn’t want to set a precedent for his friends the Israelis to seize upon.On the battlefields of Ukraine (and Kursk), there is dwindling hope of a stalemate, much less a victory, but morale is unblunted and rising, taking their cue from hopes that the war will soon be over now that Trump is almost in power.Fighting between the Russians and Ukrainians prepares to enter its final phase as World War 3 beckons for all participants involved, the neocons hatch their blots, and the global populace of innocents lowers its head, hands over its ears to avoid the deafening explosions to come. Going head to head against the Russians is not a welcome prospect to the neocons because not only would they have to draft American boys to fight but they would escalate very rapidly to a nuclear situation since Russia is in a hyper-bad mood these days and happy to rattle sabers. Too bad for the neocons.On another friend, the Israelis continue to pound their enemies in the Middle East. That bellicosity is reminiscent of the Nazis’ “hell and fire” of blitzkrieg, something the Jewish population should be very familiar with from history. Perhaps one imitates that which once hurt them, hmm?— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

(4) he remembers how the Kagan Kult arrested his previous national security advisor nominee (Gen. Flynn) for taking a meeting with a foreign leader, and doesn’t want to give them a second chance to run that playbook.
