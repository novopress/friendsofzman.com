        Looks like a trust fund kid.  Lost her faith around 2005-06 (that’s when she stops supporting Christian causes) and joined the cult.

        Don’t you understand that she is “Better People”? She and her ilk truly believe that they are superior to the Great Unwashed (read: those who do not think like them). Or should I say believe, rather than think. Core Progressive beliefs don’t require much thinking, just fervency. And who actually takes the charge of racism seriously anymore? The Progressives use the word so often it’s completely lost its meaning. And people whom they accuse of it should just brush it aside as the obnoxious noise that it is.
