        Israel can maintain itself, even without the unlimited support of America.
I doubt that, even if their neighbors decide to let them be (a big ‘if’), their demographic reality will destroy them sooner or later.

            As I noted in my comment, there are rumors that several hundred thousand Jews have already migrated to other countries – probably most to the US, unfortunately. A survey in the summer found that one in four Jews is considering leaving, and you can bet that most of these are secular Ashkenazi Jews. If even a quarter of those considering leaving actually do leave, the demographics of Israel will change even more quickly.
Israel is going to become a very different place over the next 20 or 30 years.

            Yes, Israel’s demography would be ok if it were evenly distributed…But it’s almost all Orthodox and especially ultra Orthodox…The ashkenazi who rule the place have a very low birth rate, and many of them have left the country, which started this war with less than 7 million jews..so Israel is going to be ruled by the far right, who think God has given them the right to conquer everything in the area, and that is suicide..

        I’m skeptical that Israel, at least as something resembling its present form, can exist in the Levant without a whole lot of US support.  While the leaders in many Arab states are willing to accomodate Israel, the populations of those same Arab states are outraged by Israeli conduct in Gaza, south Lebanon, Syria and what’s likely going to happen in the West Bank.  Israel’s fate is likely to resemble that of the medieval Crusader kingdoms.

            I’ve long thought the same although the Kingdom of Jerusalem wasn’t full of nukes. The reality of maintaining a distant Middle Eastern outpost surrounded by hostile neighbors is eerily similar, though.

            Their willingness to accommodate Israel strikes me more as a willingness to accommodate the US which by default means they have to accept that if they want to get along with the US they have to realize it comes as a package deal with the retarded kid brother

        The faster the neocons, the lobby and Israel fade away, the better, as they’re doing their damndest to kick off WW3 and get it spiraling out of control.  Although what they think they’d gain if nukes start flying is beyond me.

        Think of Israel as a melting ice cube. Iran, through its proxies, is applying the heat very slowly, but steadily. As the Israelites (love that term) come under increased pressure from their various enemies, they are beginning to have doubts about their future. Tens of thousands have already left Israel for good. This will accelerate in the coming year. The reason I say this is because the Israelites have spilled too much innocent Arab blood for there ever to be any rapprochement. Revenge is best served cold, and the Iranians and their proxies have nothing but time on their hands. Not only that, but there is also the fact that neither side seems interested in peace. The ice cube is melting. When it becomes small enough, Israel will simply fade into Greater Palestine. I fail to see how Trump will be relevant during this process. Maybe by giving the Israelites a little more time?

            It’s the other side of the “two-passport issue”.  Israel always liked it because it gave them an ocean of double agents to work with, but it also meant that all their citizens could pull up stakes at the sign of any inconvenience.

        Talking about “The Lobby” is like discussing ways to address the US National Debt: everyone knows it’s a problem, everyone is powerless to make the smallest change to anything because it’s career suicide.
A carrier hit would rattle both the warhawks and the spendthrifts (carriers are expensive).  Rumors were that USN Abraham Lincoln was damaged by the Houthis in the Arabian Sea last week.  Incredible claims require incredible evidence; public reports are that it quietly withdrew from the area after being untouched.
War is deception.  Who the heck knows.

            5,000 sailors on those ships, maybe even 6. No way to keep them all quiet if she took a hit. This is also why I discount theories of TWA 800 being shot down by a naval missile. Not as many crew on a Tico cruiser, but same principle. Not that I believe the official story on TWA 800, but that’s another subject.

        The IDF has proven it can do little more than drop bombs on apartment complexes and snipe pregnant women in the belly. The US Navy has spent a year struggling to fend off a bunch of guys living in tents in the desert. Everybody except for the US Congress and Rupert Murdoch hates Netanyahu (this includes Donald Trump) and Zionists are, let’s say, not what they used to be. Ben Shapiro was groomed at a very early age to step up on a day like 10/7/2023, and instead he blew up his whole operation, revealing himself to be little more than a brainless Israel shill, even accusing him of dual loyalty is too kind.And yet, it doesn’t feel like there is anything that can truly push back these people for good and get them out of our lives and out of our political system so we can have a say in our own future. Just the other day the ADL was back on the attack, accusing the videogame platform Steam of being antisemitic and demanding more censorship. I think that is what is so discouraging – it’s easy to see the cracks and fault lines, but not much can be done beyond that.

            For my whole conscious life, from their attack on “Jewish Princess” until this afternoon, the ADL has been a single relentless censorship demand. They swing their death ray around at everybody, often seemingly at random—why Steam now?—but it’s always on.It’s Steam now because the post-election pro-censorship propaganda theme is “bro.” Tech bro, passport bro, etc. The “gamer bro” is alleged to exist. The phrase does, though the phenomenon doesn’t. It’s a Twitter woman meme, and the regime is Twitter-woman-brained.Also, Steam is the *other* big privately held company—regarded as one man’s toy, like Twitter is—that doesn’t censor *everything*. Of course Steam and Twitter are both very, very heavily censored, enough to distort the worldviews of all their users—e.g., to think of them as places where the true voice of the people can be heard—but they’re not censored in *exactly* the right way. So their owners are targets—nameable, personally injurable targets.Gabe, like Elon, always caves. He sometimes pretends he doesn’t, but he does. Nerds are nerds, not “bros.”

                I pretty much agree, but it’s funny how the ADL thinks the solution to this “antisemitism on Steam” problem is to censor on Steam. I say it is funny because of course the people on Steam know exactly what is going on and not a single person on Steam is going to become “less antisemitic” (whatever that means in practice) because Jonathan Greenblatt started mandating speech codes in the platform they use and enjoy as is. Indeed, it seems like the ADL’s job is not to eliminate antisemitism but perpetuate it. It would certainly be in step with many prominent Zionist writers who felt that the goyim’s hatred of Jews was necessary for the establishment and continuation of a Jewish state.

        Israel is nothing without the United States. All its best weaponry and the specialized training required to maximize the jets and artillery stem from the Lower 48 States.Moreover, the U S. shares vital intelligence with Jerusalem, both human Intel (CIA) and satellite (NSA). And yet it is America that acts like the client-state of Israel, not the other way around.There is a psychological setup going on whereby Israel is seen as the prodigy child, to be handled with kid gloves, and Uncle Sam is the doting father. The child is to be accommodated. What else can explain U.S. licking up to a minor power that holds it in contempt?— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

        While I await moderation, I also don’t think its probable that Trump is allowed to take office. The neo-cons may not win more than 50% abroad, but they never ever lose at home. Project Ukraine cannot be allowed to be canceled. Blackrock and State Street have all that land to get, along with administering the trillions of reconstruction money. Victoria Nuland’s feelings are not interested in your facts. [She is interested in another doughnut however].All sorts of “recounting” can be done to declare Harris the winner. Moreover, the Generals and Admirals facing loss of the security clearances and firings, along with Merrick Garland and Chris Wray, can simply gin up some “emergency” and declare Martial Law. Install Obama as Supreme Leader for Life, or something like that. Who would stop them? If PA Dems in Bucks County can simply ignore court orders, what is to stop Wray and General Brown?

            Elsewhere on this thread I agree with your assessment, Whiskey.  (I remember you from ‘manosphere’ days going way back.)The missiles fired into Russia are very suspicious as to timing, and the period between now and inauguration day is as dangerous as any the nation ever has faced, in all its history.The Swamplings — both the neocons and the entrenched Left — are desperate to hold onto power and to keep their nefarious activities hidden and without consequences.  They likewise are desperate to hold onto their fat, cushy positions.  Martial law, election theft, or some other outrageous tactic definitely is on the table and the plans may well already have been made.Nuland serves as an accurate face of the treachery, and she has a lot of company.

        Z-Man — I don’t think Israel can or will live in peace with its neighbors. Not because of Israel but Islam. Muslims are not like White people. Polygamy, Big Man-ism, tribal raiding societies make their behavior completely alien to White people. That is why (no offense) you can’t imagine JIHAD as the total organizing principle of most Muslims.Take the Oct 7 raids. What White guy on a raid has dragged off howling young women to be their sex slave since at least the Christianization of Europe? Can you imagine someone in the 1917 Punitive Expedition into Mexico with Pershing acting this way? Or if so, not be court-martialed for it? But that sort of thing is a Tuesday for Muslims. As Hamas said, they are not interested in better living for their people. They are interested in JIHAD. That applies to the mass of the Egyptians, Jordanians, Syrians, Turks, Iraqis, and Iranians as well.Sooner or later their aging, “lets not trade nukes” leaders will be removed in favor of JIHAD and Israel will be toast. The Ayatollah boasts Israel is just a two bomb nation, meaning only two will be required for JIHAD to take over. The future for Israel will look much like that Fallout game plus Oct 7, on a massive scale.There just is not any possibility of peace. Muslims gotta Muslim. Its who they are on a genetic level — tribal raiders no more or less.

            Some extremely black-pilled cynics predicted that this year’s steal would be to conceal a landslide, not to beat it. Looks like that’s what’s happened.
Best of both worlds for the regime. Trump, political symbol of the normal man, doesn’t *really* win, but the “counter-elite” (not a thing) does, and Trump is their cover to commit all the horrors they desire.

        Ken Adelman (Iraq cakewalk) , RIchard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Scooter Libby, Douglas Feith (General Franks called him the dumbest guy on the planet, Office of Special Plans under Rumsfeld) and more.  These were the people that were first exposed to me at least, under the term neocon.    Every damn one of them was also an Israel Firster.  Very close to Zionist if not Zionist adjacent.  This is three straight days of posting that neocons and Zionists are totally different animals. Actually not that different.  All neocons are Israel First.

            Even if there is some distinction between them, it’s all the same to me in that they view America as a vehicle to carry out their foreign interest/aims.  Both are at best disinterested in what is in America’s interest and both at worst are deliberately trying to destroy the US. Both sets should be sent to the same concentration camp and be met with equal justice.

                        Gate of Vienna is notoriously a kosher-right site.
It was GoV that made me aware of the kosher capture of the dissident, anti-immigration sphere in Scandinavia, and their efforts to re-direct anti-immigration sentiment onto hating on the Mohammadans.
They were in this circle of “far right” websites who all linked to each other and never to anything outside. That’s how I Noticed what Mark Steyn, Douglas Murray, Gaad Saad and Tommy Robinstein were all about; it was always these same guys they quoted and featured in their blogs and pieces.

        Generational change is worth discussing here. Netanyahu is old. The Ayatollah is even older. Amazingly, the median age in Israel is below Iran’s (29 vs. 31) and its fertility rate is much higher than Iran’s, although Iran’s population dwarfs Israel’s (84M vs. 10M). So we’re on the cusp of enormous cultural and demographic change. Iran and Turkiye have the same population but Turkiye is 3x wealthier and we here would consider Turkiye poor. So it’s just inevitable that Iran will have to focus on economic development and that Israel will get less bellicose as the ultra-Orthodox become demographically dominant. This is the recipe for peace. The job of the US should be to catalyze the process.

            The ultra-Orthodox don’t seem too peaceful. As they become the dominant group in Israel, the country will become more dysfunctional and bellicose. Israel will also seem stranger to western eyes and even the Ashkenazi Jews in the West.

                The ultra-orthodox also don’t fight. They demand other people do the fighting for them while they study the Talmud. So, I don’t know how you square that circle. I don’t know what Israel looks like as a country with a vastly higher ultra-Orthodox population but it will be a much different one than exists today.

        Trump is a product of Queens NY and, as such, bravura is in his blood. But he is no real brawler like the boys from the Bronx. He talks a good game, but negotiation is his aim. So yes, he cut deals with the Lobby and Biden to get reelected and that will be his MO going forward. With Putin, the only real path forward is a new European security framework in which Russia gets its needs met and the West still gets limited access to Ukrainian resources. In the ME, Netanyahoo must go and the Palestinians must get a real and independent homeland. Can Trump do this? We’ll see.

            The danger is between now and inauguration.  Globohomo is not known for losing gracefully, and they may well incite WW3 to keep Donald from assuming power.  Declaration of martial law by no means is beyond them.
Pootin of course preferred a Kamala win, as Trump’s past term demonstrated strong state-of-Israel backing, and Kammie would be a powderpuff, figurehead Commander in Chief.  She knows zilch about global military strategy, meaning the current Usual Suspects would remain as decision-makers.

                I’m not following you. Why would Putin want a continuation of whomever is behind the curtain, shipping arms to Ukraine, resulting in dead Russians?
Trump, OTOH. at least says he wants a deal. Putin says his terms are all the Donbas, Kursk, Crimea, and all the way to whatever oblast Odessa is in, NATO stays out of Ukraine, plus war reparations, the last of which which is the only negotiable part.
Trump doesn’t care about any of that, one way or the other.

        American Zionism diminishes every day, because every day the silents and boomers are dying. Xers aren’t as zionist, and the generations under them aren’t zionist at all. Jews gotta make hay while the sun shines. There is only so long they can hold congress captive to an agenda the voters reject. For now, enough voters are still on board. But fewer every day.

            Being Zionist largely depends on how you practice your religion, or lack thereof. I live in the South, and on Evangelical church grounds I see a lot of Israel flags sitting under American ones. There are also a lot of old Republicans. The priest at my Orthodox church even says “Judeo-Christian” every now and then. So from my vantage point, Zionism is alive and well. In fact Christianity is alive and well, despite all the claims I hear about it dying.But this is anecdotal of course. The one thing that will rid the US of Philosemitism is simply the demographics…the browner you are, the more secular you are, the less you care about the Third Temple. I kind of think that Philosemitism is a white thing…specifically and Anglo-white thing. And like all things Anglo-white, it’s being overtaken by other cultures.

        Trump is doing the good cop bad cop thing with his nominations.  His ultimate goal is probably an Israel-Iran peace treaty.  If you want to kill the interventionists and neocons and MIC in one shot, negotiate a peace treaty.Time to take the candy away from the hyperactive children.Russia took a hit from those new missiles, reports say.  I think they’ll absorb these hits as basically mosquito bites knowing that the regime in Washington is trying to provoke a European wider war.  Putin will wait out Biden and deal with Trump.Trump can deflate the Ukrainian Army by stopping the funding.  He should form a joint commission with Russia to investigate the Nordstream bombing and arrest everyone who participated in terrorism grounds, no matter where that trial leads.The current Washington regime should be thought of as a hurricane.  It struck Ukraine, killing many, and now it’s time to help them recover.  I think the best approach is some sort of bilateral operation with the Russians to get things back to something resembling normal in Ukraine.Hold US citizens accountable for terrorism would be a good step in that direction.

                Think of the ATACMS missiles like the German V2 rockets at the end of WW2.  The V2’s were mostly a terror weapon by 1945.
My advice to Trump would be to flip the script on Ukraine.  Meet with Putin.  Hold the warmongers accountable.  Set up bilateral teams to deescalate the situation and investigate some of the terror attacks.

            I think Putin is astute to know that a new sheriff will be in town come January 20 and that starting a war would be unnecessary. My guess is a peace deal will give the Donbass and Crimea and any other seized land with ethnic Russians to the Russians, ban Ukraine from  joining NATO and transform Ukraine into a landlocked rump state with a military that can’t threaten the Russians.
That’s a good deal for us. It’s a shame we wasted billions over there and likely much of those funds were skimmed by the Ukies, who are absurdly corrupt.

        I think that Chronic Bagel Fatigue is starting to have an effect on the younger Normies. People are just tired of them, and their constant demands.Like I said the other day, the Trump Administration can appoint Iran hawks, but with the President-elect stating that he intends to declare an emergency with respect to the illegal invasion and the open border, and use the armed forces, as is his duty as Commander-in-Chief, that means the forces available to make war on Iran for Bagel Land won’t be there. Not when the forces needed are deployed to the Rio Grande, where they belong, and where Normie wants them.

            This view makes the most sense, and is likely what Trump is thinking. However, the argument from sanity may fail unless Trump has predetermined that he will never go to war with Iran no matter what and the “no matter what” fails to sway him in the coming year.Israel and Netanyahu are desperate and delusional over existential problems, and they believe that getting America to defeat Iran will solve all their problems. Contra Z-Man, Scott Ritter believes Israel is already dead due to economic and demographic factors.Per Douglas MacGregor, sanity does not go above two star generals in the GAE Military, and the Pentagon especially does not want to hear it. The consensus is stuck in the pre 2020, maybe pre 2000 world where Iran is viewed as weak and America is still a super power with an army that can roll Arab nations.One possible scenario is Trump has already offered the Israel Lobby an “easy” war with Iran to appease the foreign policy and military establishments in order to have a free hand on domestic issues. Mr. Art of the Deal and all.Also contra Z-Man, Judge Napolitano’s crew has dug up dirt on Tulsi Gabbard that says she’s an Iran hawk. Thiel is also an Iran hawk.All the weights in the political calculus say a war with Iran will happen. Sanity and feasibility have not been reliable indicators for a long time.

            Even if CBF (Chronic Bagel Fatigue) takes over the mainstream, there’s still lots going on in the shadows we won’t know about. So if some J-Lobby clout can’t make it rain missiles on Iran, you can bet that Trump’s Zionists will be engineering all kinds of back room schemes. In fact, it’s the Bagel’s natural habitat.

        ‘To some degree, Trump’s victory is due to the Biden administration making the strategic blunder of prioritizing Ukraine over Israel after October 7, 2023.’To a minor degree, perhaps.  The election of Trump was much more a rebuke of the southern open border, and of the deliberate tanking of the economy (and the dollar) in order to destroy America and Build Back Better, i.e., install the totalitarian NWO.Ironically, Trump kicked off the ruination of the economy by shilling his disastrous Operation Warp Speed poison vax program.  How quickly the sheeple forget.  Small business was decimated by resultant ludicrous vax restrictions, and the nation still has not recovered.The average citizen is not obsessed with Zionism or ‘the Jews’.  He is, however, very much indirectly affected by Sabbatean/Frankist cultural and moral outlooks.  The Sixties movements drew heavily from this rogue-Jewish pseudo-religion, and that Sixties mentality — and those Sixties actors — still drive the Left in the West.

            I’m open to the possibility that voters simply reject women presidents, any women presidents, and this is what propelled Trump to the WH both times. And factored into why he lost the other time. I have always said Trump didn’t win 2016 on policy, he won because he faced the most odious major party candidate of modern times. Maybe any times. I think there may have been something of a repeat of that in 2024, when he faced another anointed, entitled candidate who had no substance whatsoever. Who both happened to be women.This could also hamstring the Democrat party for many elections to come, as they are not even capable of having a conversation about whether or not they should be nominating women, but would rather bash their heads against the glass ceiling time after time. If we ever get both major parties nominating women, I bet you’ll see record 3rd party voting. If the GOP has any sense (highly questionable) and any will to win (even more questionable) they will always nominate a man anytime the Ds nominate a woman. Which should be often.

                “…I’m open to the possibility that voters simply reject women presidents, any women presidents,…”Count on it.  If one looks at all other political positions, we see women’s inclusion grow.  A female in the Presidency is one of the Leftist’s top prizes.  What we’ve seen really is a selection of candidates—Clinton and Harris—who were woefully inadequate to the job.  Clinton, aside from being evil, was bitchy.  Harris was a moron, and might be bitchy as well.  They thought they’d push her in as a “twofer”.  Then there is the confounding factor of Trump as an opponent.  Trump is not known to pay much deference to the “fairer sex”.Given another circumstance, say a better economy and a reasonably intelligent, independent female candidate, you’ll have the first woman president.

                    Another long term weakness for the Ds is that in their quest for vaginocracy they will choose an underqualified woman over a better qualified man every time. Since it’s been at least 5 elections since they’ve held an honest primary without the DNC’s finger on the scale for their handpicked candidate.

                        I was actually going to say that it would be a Rep as the first woman president, but then thought better as such would seem to contradict our  continuing discussion as to demographic change and perhaps this “last hurrah” for the Rep’s with Trump.

                        Compsci, there is plenty of reason to believe that mestizo and negro males are reluctant to vote for a woman. If the Ds persist in nominating women, and I believe they will, then this could keep the door open for the Rs for many years to come, in spite of the demographic changes

They will also select an empty-headed woman over a better-qualified woman who disagrees with the current DNC talking points in the slightest.
I’m skittish about Tulsi, but there was no more qualified of the DNC candidates when she ran for Prez. She just had misgivings about 3rd trimester abortions, so she had to go.

                    The Ds had a decent female presidential candidate, but they ran her out of the party.
No, Tulsi is not perfect, but she’s worlds better than completely awful candidates like Clinton and Harris.

                        Actually, although you’d never know it unless you lived here and knew the person, ex-senator Kyrsten Sinema—who was driven out also—might have been a good candidate.She of all the Dem’s I’ve ever known was a true independent and never really a politically ambitious, pompous ass.  We’d use her, when she was a legislator in the State House to promote pro-gun legislation.  Yep, she was the local go-to person for gun rights.  She simply refused to toe the party line when it got in her way.  For example, she preserved the filibuster while in the Senate and her party went wild.Of course, walking down the middle of the street just means you get hit from both lanes.  She went independent and then simply quite when the Dem’s said they’d put up another candidate to run against her..

                Agreed.  The Demoncraps were SO obsessed with shooing a FIRST TIME FEMALE! into office and MAKING HISTORY! that they ran Hilderbeest, a witch that all sane people despise, and then Klooless Kamala the second time. . . a totally incompetent candidate.If the Dems had run any kind of reasonable person, they probably would have won both races.  But the base of the party is the Empowered Single Woman, and their intransigence and rigidity — dare I say sexism? lol — cost them both elections.They are their own worst enemy, and praise God for it.  The kingdom of the demons ever is divided against itself.

            Three wars.  That was a huge factor.  Nobody is fooled by what the regime is doing, but everyone feels powerless to stop the regime.  So they voted for Trump.  His coalition will grow as it becomes clear to Low Information Voters that he’s not actually Hitler like they were promised.Anti regime civil unrest I think is coming.  That’s what DOGE, Trump’s other nominations, and the election really are: orderly civil unrest.It’s the other things you cited, too.  But I’m married to a LIV who sometimes succumbs to the propaganda on her Apple phone news feed.  She did a 180 last year when I started showing her how the regime is escalating for WW3.  “Is this what you want?  Your son and two daughters drafted to die in a pointless war in Eastern Europe?”She flipped, and then started consuming other news sources and realized (woke up to) how bad things are.  I give her shit all the time, in a nice way.  “You want all these lunatics to be given access to power, but you refuse to accept that the resulting societal collapse is your fault.”

        Who could’ve predicted that using universities &amp; the entire media apparatus to villifiy White people as evil colonial nazis while simultaneously importing millions of brown people &amp; labeling them moral saints would destroy support for israel in the west?
Its a real head scratcher to be sure. Clearly the solution to this debacle is to degrade the west even more, slaughter all the palestinians while everyone watches &amp; act with extreme aggression towards the neighboring arab countries who are increasingly aligning themselves with the eastern superpowers. That’s a recipe for success if I’ve ever seen one.

                I was going to post somewhere that the up and down voting seems to have vanished. This seems like a good place to do that. At first I thought I had somehow logged out of the site. I see Ostei also noticed this though.

        Israel may have a future but it’s a bleak one
and I daresay, Master Zman, that your assumptions of Israel’s continued viability seem to be based on old ideas and realities of the prior century that no longer have much currency.
anyone know of the last time the Pope, of all people, had any words of condemnation for Israel? The last time the UN has charged any nation with genocide. ?
if Israel does manage to carry on, it will be in a much reduced and circumscribed form imo,

        Have no idea if this is true, but I heard that hundreds of thousands of Jews have already left Israel. A survey showed at one in four are considering leaving. And you can bet that these are the secular Ashkenazi Jews. I’d suspect that quite a few will eventually leave (terrible news for the US, btw), meaning that Israel is going to get real Orthodox, real fast.
Good luck with that.

            I have heard direct from the horse’s mouth that many are fleeing Europe and bidding up hi-rise values in Tel Aviv. The people who told me that, I came close to saying, “Barbara Lerner Spectre’s chickens coming home to roost.”I didn’t have the heart to say it. You aren’t going to convince people who are convinced the world is just bent against them for no reason otherwise.We’re all on our own now as collectives that is. Our people have a real challenge to shake off atomized individualism. I think all of them should find a way to hang out regularly with tribesmen. They will learn and see very quickly that are not and never will be one of them – even the most liberal is defined as being apart.It is at once a source of tremendous strength and that by definition causes tremendous problems when the outsiders finally start asking, “How well is this working out for me?”Last fall plus Musk’s Twitter and TikTok was a seismic event under seismic conditions of information flow.Vivek’s initial commentary at the outset of the R primaries were revealing. They were probably his honest thoughts. He got a talking to by a superior power and changed his talking points. A deal was struck.However, once you start brow beating powerful and ascendent people into submission you start making more and more powerful enemies who perhaps once just were saying what they thought was right who had no problem with you into someone who now holds a deep resentment of being cowed and humiliated. This is happening more and more.In the end, for us, we are far removed from political power. We have to take care of ourselves, avoid blaming other groups and just take control of our own lives. We must network, acquire redoubts and strengthen the network continuously.Things are playing out in a way that is out of our control. The 20th century was a disaster that turned America into probably the greatest tragedy in terms of a state in all of human history. A vast continent with extreme wealth with a spirited, intelligent and strong people surrounded by vast oceans and possessing a huge aresenal of ICBMs.Ellis Island and an open society along with the moral/religious fall of the WASPs will turn out to have been fatal. The only thing we can do now that is effective is concentrate all effort on our own business as a people and build networks that create patrimony and keep what we build within our own kind. Everyone else does it and if we don’t a bad situation will turn catastrophic.As for the foreign theater it is dependent on the domestic theater and untenable arrangements filled with unviable contradictions a need for secrecy and tacit submission … … is going to unravel. We are best to stay out of it and tend to ourselves. That is, until one or some of our people are finally willing to be explicit in standing up for us with a calm and dignified strength.

        On the other hand, her air defense capabilities are also much better, largely due to Russian assistance
I was pondering this morning if the Team B Jews were growing increasingly hostile to the whole Ukraine adventure as Israel seems to be the only place getting punished for NATOs moves.  With the Team A cultists/neocons trying desperately to fire up WWIII on their way out things could get spicy (but, of course, nothing ever happens).

            I am certain this is true, and explains much about the Zionist support for Trump. The coming war with Iran would be considerably less fraught if Russia was on the sidelines, and they have the Trotskyites to blame that she isn’t.

        The existence of “Israel” is entirely predicated on a deception regarding the origin of the word ‘jew’. America, being a nominally Christian nation, is easily deceived by this word-play because of constant (((Hollywood))) propaganda and brainwashing over the past century. The typical judeo-Christian (i.e. Catholic, Protestant, Baptist, Lutheran etc etc), specifically those in modern mega churches, understands less about the Bible than they do about the so called “holocaust”. This is not only born from ignorance but as spiritual blindness foretold in Isaiah 6:9.A country predicated on the lie of being the homeland of the “jews” when the people calling themselves jews are in fact descendants of Khazars, Edomites, Canaanites, Africans and Arabs without any Israelite blood whatsoever cannot survive. Scams, hoaxes and ponzi schemes always go bust at a certain point and so will the ultimate scam called “Israel”.The origin of the word jew:https://archive.org/details/originofthewordjew2/mode/2up?view=theaterJesus was not a jew either by ancestry or religion:https://archive.org/details/jesus-was-not-a-jew-either-by-religion-or-by-ancestry/page/n1/mode/2upImportant history not being taughthttps://fgcp.org/important-history-not-being-taught-part-4

        Just as the Biden administration was the last gasp of neoconservatism, Trump may be the last gasp for American Zionism.Flooding the West with Third World savages has exacerbated the trend we see from polling and actuarial tables. Mass migration is a minor project of the Zionists but a far greater goal of the Neocons. The Zionists can take their foot off the accelerator on mass migration and the Neocons cannot, and that will prove to be a flashpoint between the groups very soon; in many ways it mirrors the tension between supporters of the Ukraine war and those who cheer the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Both groups are horrible human beings, but our interests on this single issue of migration align with the Zionists. It is hard not to root for injuries, though.As an aside, there is just as much a possibility of a lasting peace with Iran as it is for an all-out war. Iran has proved far weaker than claimed yet has demonstrated the capacity to inflict massive damage on Tel Aviv. The latter likely will cause the United States to back off more than bad PR of a burning and sunk carrier. Follow the shekels.

                    My understanding is that Israel has not been able to lay a glove on Iran. My sources are people like Scott Ritter, Alastair Crooke, Douglas Macgregor, and Larry Johnson.
