        Seriously, the amount of debt in the world is unpayable.  And that is before you get into unfunded entitlements and unvoted on government pensions.   None of it is going to be paid for or out, so what happens then?   War happens.  You can already see the various players getting ready to go at it.  And like a fire in the forrest, the survivors will have a nice bunch of nutrients (so to speak) to grow in.   Man I would love to be the person that plugs ole Soros when the SHTF üôÇ

        Since at least 2008, the byword of our elites has been ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs good for Goldman Sachs is good for the USA.‚ÄùThe bailout of 2008 was largely orchestrated for the purpose of making sure that Goldman Sachs did not collapse like Bear Stearns and Lehman.  This was eagerly done because it was widely understood that if Goldman collapsed it would take a hefty chunk of the DC-Wall street elite nexus with it ‚Äì and so it was done, with a massive amount of fiat money and Fed manipulations, and called wise and good.This ‚Äúsolution‚Äù has distorted central bank policies on a global scale for nearly a decade, and in the process has transformed private banks into giant hedge funds ‚Äì just look at Deutsche Bank ‚Äì speculating on stocks, real estate and derivative paper to make a profit.  Which, surprise surprise! was what triggered the 2008 crisis in the first place.  So, we‚Äôve returned to square one, with the only change being we are massively more in debt and the central banks are out of magic bullets.  This almost guarantees that our next ‚Äúnormal‚Äù business cycle recession will quickly escalate into a global financial crisis. This time not only will it take out a good chunk of the DC-Wall Street nexus, state pension funds will certainly go, and quite possibly a good chunk of the welfare state.Should Trump lose, my siliver lining is that I can‚Äôt imagine a better person to preside over this debacle than Hillary Clinton, since her greed and corruption are so emblematic of it.

        You‚Äôre not thinking creatively enough. There‚Äôs $25 trillion in 401k accounts just waiting to be confiscated. Any good Democrat can tell you that prudence requires investors to move increasing percentages of their IRA assets into safe investments, e.g., Treasuries, as they age in order to avoid risks due to market fluctuation. And hey, if Treasuries bear a negative interest rate it‚Äôs still better to lose 2% or 3% every year than to risk a wholesale loss in a market collapse. This requirement can probably be imposed administratively and doesn‚Äôt ever require an act of Congress. See how easy that is?I‚Äôm always a little skeptical of Ambrose. He‚Äôs been writing these ‚Äúcollapse is right around the corner‚Äù articles since 2008. In a financial system in which money is nothing more than credit created from thin air‚Äìwe don‚Äôt even print much physical paper anymore‚Äìthere‚Äôs no theoretical limit to the level of debt that can be absorbed by the system. As long as producers of real goods and real services continue to exchange their goods and services for credit money the game keeps going. If the petrodollar collapses then all bets are off and it‚Äôs get your guns and ammo time.I read these events as more of a preparation to crash the global economy in the event that we dirt people have the audacity to elect Trump instead of Hillary. Or maybe the central banks are signaling to Trump that, if elected, he either plays ball with them or they will crash the global economy, thereby ruining his presidency.

        The system is built on growth. We have had no real growth for at least 15 years, so it gets papered over with credit creation for the masses, while real assets flow to the top 1% over time.The resolution is a debt jubilee, either planned and structured, or unplanned and chaotic.  The ancients knew that too much debt is destructive, so the debt jubilees were planned and put on the calendar for all to see. That way both borrowers and lenders knew what they were getting into, and structured their transactions accordingly.  The evil of Washington and the Federal Reserve is that they have structured a system that ignores the reality and the need for debt jubilees, and instead ties success to pulling tomorrow‚Äôs wealth forward into today through credit, and then hopes and prays that the real growth in the economy continues to support it all.  At the same time, the system evolves away from a meritorious one where valued work is rewarded, and instead graft and cronyism bleeds down the vigor of the economy.  So we end up where we are today, in a box with no good way out.  In the meantime, the 70 year olds in charge try to ‚Äúkeep-things-going-just-a-bit-longer‚Äù.  Their time frame and preferences are a bit different than those of the rest of us, sadly.

            Very good!  You‚Äôre only the second person I‚Äôve ever heard that mentioned a debt jubilee.  The first was Ray Dalio, who I think is the one of the smartest investors I‚Äôve ever met.  One other issue about growth.  It used to be that growth brought jobs but technological growth is creating a surplus of unemployed who have to be fed and warehoused.  So technology not only has the potential to drive down wages but it also may serve to increase taxes so we can feed the ‚Äúforgotten brigade.‚Äù

                One theory that has always been floating around is that war is the elite‚Äôs way to reduce the population of poor but fierce young males.  Economic progress always seems to create untethered, underemployed hormonally active boys that can be sent off as ‚Äúcannon fodder‚Äù.  Tech is a modern version of the same old story.  I am not sure how the theory can ever be proven or disproven.

                Technology does change the career landscape and will have an effect on job availability but the most of those changes will be limited to large employers. Small bakeries, one and two man software development shops, the convenience store on the corner, the dentist‚Äôs office, the insurance agents and beauty shops may gain some efficiencies, they will all still need accountants to manage taxes, secretaries to handle the mail and file forms, answer the phones and lawyers to handle legal issues.Only the very large firms will have the stability and wealth necessary to allow for the very expensive development of robotic systems or other automation techniques that technology offer.Anyone with fewer than a hundred employees may be able to shed a clerk or two, but most small businesses just don‚Äôt have the business volume or stability necessary to automate.Crony capitalism encourages government regulation that small businesses simply cannot handle.  Most doctors are now employees working for hospitals or other medical providers instead of running independent offices and managing their own practices.It is the growth of government bureaucracies and regulations that have the largest impact on jobs and employment, not technology per se.

                    You couldn‚Äôt be more wrong.CNC machining is automation.  It allows manufacturers large and small to run multiple machines with one man, and to produce parts complete that decades ago would have required secondary operations and more man-hours.CNC machining is approachable even for small companies.  A used piece of equipment can be had for $30,000 or less.  A very good turning center with live tooling, just a few years old, for $100,000.And of course this doesn‚Äôt even factor in the enormous benefits to all companies from things like the internet and affordable computing power ‚Äî these things mainly benefit small employers, who can‚Äôt afford, say, an entire marketing department, but who can now easily outsource such functions to freelancers.

        Universal suffrage is a one way street. No reform is possible. A pause is possible, or once was. Reagan was a pause. But that type of possibility by now seems to be, well, impausible. As we see in the real world there is only one solution to exponential bullshit‚Äìand it is a solution‚Äìand that is bankruptcy. All pretext stops. What is left is real. Why couldn‚Äôt we see that before, when it was so obvious? That will solve financial equations. No fiat money. No omnibus spending. On and on. What small fraction of today‚Äôs wealth did depression era Americans need to live, love, get a haircut, and watch his neighbor fall off the roof? But that will not so easily solve our political bankruptcy‚Äìdiversity, equality, tribes, creeds, gender‚Äìfor which universal suffrage is the magnet. If the Right is ready that is the only opportunity it will have to re-shape America. It‚Äôs advantage is that it does not need to invent, but rediscover.

            Excellent comment. Iirc, there was a US senator from Kansas or Oklahoma who voiced principled objections to New Deal programs. He was defeated in the next election, an object lesson in what the electorate valued even then.
It‚Äôs a wonder the man‚Äôs face isn‚Äôt on Mt. Rushmore to teach that lesson through all eternity for politicians in democratic polities.

        War abroad seems to be the preferred way to juice the economy and distract the masses from bad economics at home. Perhaps that‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been poking the bear. Woo! Team Amurica! Git dem filthy russkies!
Well, if they try to conscript me for something other than deportation forces, I‚Äôm gone. Dust in the wind. I‚Äôd gladly fight for my grandfather‚Äôs America. This America, no thanks. I‚Äôve no interest in dying for a country of Blacks, Mexicans, and White sluts.

        I‚Äôve always been interested in the Great Depression. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the impact on my grandparents. I think the major thing that people don‚Äôt realize is that those people did not expect to get hit with a major depression. It was good times in the late 20s. People had jobs and could buy nice stuff. And just like that, it went bust.There is nothing special about us, that prevents the good times from going away. There are Hoovervilles even now, but we don‚Äôt talk about them because Obama is in office. If Trump wins, it will be all over the news. And these Hoovervilles are full of people that could use a job. But we can‚Äôt have them working, because we must take in all the brown people of the world and give them jobs instead. One of these days, I‚Äôll be in Portland and take pictures of the people with their tarps, shopping carts and piles of stuff, set up on the sidewalks, some next to the freeway. it‚Äôs the Portlandia they don‚Äôt want to talk about.

        ‚ÄúThe connection here is that it is human nature to observe the actions of others, trust those actions and to infer things from them.‚Äù
You just connected the dots for me concerning the usage of polls in election campaigns.  Campaigns not only use polls to determine the effectiveness of their advertisements and messaging, but to also to offer self confidence to questioning voters. I‚Äôve long speculated that many voters care more about voting for the winners than they do about candidates. You observation fits the truth better than my speculations.

            The problem is what ‚Äúfar away from urban area‚Äôs‚Äù actually means. There is very little tillable land in this country that is far away from at least some urban area.

            There is the small detail of being able to ‚Äòmaintain title‚Äô if the SHTF against the local broke-but-charismatic ‚Äòentrepreneurs‚Äô (aka local warlords) that are bound to arise if only to ward off raiding parties from the urbs.  As a non-local non-resident you are an obvious first target.  So you must either must become that warlord or be quick to identify and ally with him.You will have an opportunity to divert the disposed against the local corporately owned hi-tech, hi-capital ag holdings. But after plundering likely comes hunger since high tech farming requires a vast business ecosystem that is unlikely to survive.  Amish-style low tech farming requires significantly more land per bushel of output plus considerable expertise plus different ag-machinery capital (involving horses so there‚Äôs the required pasturage + woodlots for heat ).

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶The fact is, there‚Äôs a limit to how much the world can borrow from the future. We are probably near that limit‚Ä¶Instead it means a disorganized and haphazard retreat‚Ä¶‚ÄùThey‚Äôve already got this figured out. They‚Äôre going to Special Drawing Rights SDR‚Äôs. There will be a big financial crisis and SDR‚Äôs will come in to save the day. It will of course be the same rip off but on a bigger scale. See below. They explain it all.http://philosophyofmetrics.com/http://redefininggod.com/Our money supply system is stupid. A child can see it‚Äôs stupid. All money is created as debt so to pay off the interest you have to have more money‚Ä¶created with more debt. Simple arithmetic will show you that the interest portion will grow to unsustainable levels as the debt compounds. Maybe this is the reason we are suffering so. Mass interest and debt accumulation. The people in control of this FED and other central bank owners are allowed to create any amount of currency while sticking us with the debt. Nice racket if you can get it. Since money i based on debt if we pay off all the debt‚Ä¶we would have NO MONEY!There‚Äôs another way of thinking about this. If all the goods and services in the economy were backed or shadowed by an equivalent amount of currency we would have a situation were there would be debt but it would be owed to no one in particular. The cash would be a direct substitute for goods and services. Benjamin Franklin wrote about the currency in Pennsylvania that worked like this but based on land. It worked very well and provided prosperity for the whole community. Of course when the Bank of England found out about it the King made them stop causing the whole community to crash into a downward spiral. Possibly being one of the reasons  for the revolution.http://www.philadelphiafed.org/publications/economic-education/ben-franklin-and-paper-money-economy.pdfLook at Scott Smith, a guy running for president, ideas on debt and taxes. I don‚Äôt work for him or have any dealings with him I just ran across his ideas surfing the web.http://www.scottsmith2016.com/His ideas are extremely good. For revenue instead of getting most from income taxes he would get revenue from settlements. Like every time you buy something or deposit a check in the bank, etc. The value of this is it massively raises the tax base so that the amount of each transaction is minuscule. I read, ‚ÄúFor Good and Evil: The Impact of Taxes on the Course of Civilization‚Äù by Charles Adams a book on taxes and it talked a lot about raising the tax base in order to lower the percentage taken from each transaction and to spread out where revenues came from.Let‚Äô look at the numbers he quotes.Payrolls total $15 trillion.Not much for filling a $4 trillion federal spending.The base for what he calls payments, (transactions), is 3,600 Trillion. Big difference. So using this big difference he would only take a tax rate of just 1/8 of a percent.He also would stop charging interest as the money is made and backed by the taxpayers. He would only give banks a service fee. (I don‚Äôt agree with this. I think a small interest paid to the Federal Gov. would be helpful providing the majority of it went to the treasury and bypassed the FED and banks.)He‚Äôs got some great ideas on lots of issues. He‚Äôll never get any publicity from the media with his cut out the FED ideas but they‚Äôre worth thinking about. My biggest problem is just how, even with such small percentage of tax, he would keep corporations and the 1% from gaming it so they pay none.Another thing Smith wants to do is pay the debt off. He points out that all the debt pays interest so it gets bigger and bigger. There‚Äôs a not so evident twist to the debt. Here it is‚Ä¶as soon as the debt is issued it is financialized. It becomes money. It may be debt but in today‚Äôs world you can use this promise to pay to raise cash. Therefore the money supply is already inflated by the debt. Get it? Debt becomes cash through financialization.He says,‚Äù‚Ä¶Coupon stripping would not be inflationarybecause it would replace our existing supply of interest bearingmoney with non-interest-bearing money‚Ä¶‚ÄùWhen he says coupon stripping he‚Äôs talking about the old time bonds. Here‚Äôs a picture.http://www.coxrail.com/images/bond&amp;coups.jpgEach bond has coupons that when torn off at a certain date become money. He says we pay all the bonds off with non interest bearing CASH now instead of letting the debt inflate further. The bonds have become cash already so it‚Äôs not necessarily inflationary to turn them into cash.Here‚Äôs another quote,‚Äù‚Ä¶Ironically, we would have inflated the money supply less if we had issued new money to pay for the deficit each year rather than selling Treasury bonds. At least ordinary money does not accrue interest‚Ä¶‚ÄùThat being the case he says we should pay off all debt within five years.Here‚Äôs a link to his pay off the debt page.http://www.scottsmith2016.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Pay-Off-the-Debt.pdfI think he‚Äôs somewhat right about turning debt into cash not being inflationary but not 100%. Some debt is parked and if they were forced to accept cash I have no doubt they would buy assets for cash causing some inflation. His point over all I believe is sound. That printing cash is less damaging to the economy than continuously expanding debt. Yes there is a limit to this. The damage is less when you have instant inflation that the delayed case of delayed debt. When you have instant feedback from printing cash you also can see the damage and correct it faster. The debt is hidden as it takes some money out of circulation while NOT extinguishing it. When debt is turned to cash it‚Äôs influence can‚Äôt be stopped as easy.

        The other source of plunder for the connected grifters and grafters is the endowments of NGO world, private universities most definitely included.  Plus, unlike 401k‚Äôs they have the easy possibility of being effectively demonized by the Dirt People.  So an inviting target for the aspiring pseudo-populist political entrepreneur.
Perhaps the few actually smart Cloud People realize this, hence the visceral fear of Trump.

                Maybe üôÇ   But I notice that when various countries (e.g. Argentina) renege on their debt (an auto jubilee?) they get new credit at only a few point higher interest.  The lenders are kind of stymied; if they don‚Äôt lend they don‚Äôt make any profits.  So borrowers can wait them out‚Ä¶
