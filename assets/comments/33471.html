        No. The only “value” I see coming from AI is increased surveillance and ability to be spied on.

            Agreed.  AI will probably become the latest Tower of Babel.

            The value of LLM is to sift through mountains of information. You can already imagine how the metadata gathered by the intel agencies will be sifted and sorted by LLMs – all the better to monitor you with, my dear.

            And censorship.“AI” already ruined the internet by filling it with lies, dead ends, and targeted time-wasting. Even 4chan is mostly chatbot training threads now. Social media is largely the waste they produce. What’s left that’s real? If you’re not a shill and you’re not banned, you’re training just your replacement. (Hello, Eglin!)Notably, the “built for BBC” and “without sounding mad” spammers on 4chan are still real people, Israelis and Indians. Chatbots would be better at it—they’d never get enraged by trolls and reveal themselves, for example—and white Americans would do the job better by not sounding weird, knowing idiomatic English, and not being narcissistic. But they aren’t considered fit for the job for some reason, maybe because cultivating careers inpropaganda against usfor our greatest ally and our finest immigrants is more important than the work itself.Know anything about Fiji? I know one thing. It once was Fiji. Now it’s asite of ethnic conflictbetween the Fijians (“ethnic Fijians,” they’re called now) and the “Indo-Fijians” the British sent there to replace them. So it’s like 4chan. There was a native Fijian coup in reaction/rejection, but it came too late and failed. So that’s the model—for the world.I’ve seen some of our guys who think they’re clever asking our overlords, “Why do you need all these H1-Bs if AI is going to replace them almost immediately?” Thinking they found agotcha, they don’t consider the answer.

            Howard Luttnick, Trump’s right-hand man, has already spoken gleefully of grabbing just one percent of the rights to the United States’ natural assets, which he estimates at some 500 trillion dollars.Larry Ellison has chimed in to say he wants to “cure cancer” with tailored mRNA produced in 48 hours. In other words, he’s the preview to the movie “I Am Legend”, about the zombie plague.All of Elon Musk’s projects are actually tied into one vision: an American flag on Mars.He’s getting the rich to finance his vision.Sam Altman and Peter Thiel see a means to force us into a social mold of their design. No doubt to prevent another Holocaust of the gays and nonwhites.Larry Fink, with his Alladin AI, dreams of an ordered economy…with his people doing the ordering.

            Bingo!  As a Luddite, I can’t stand all these AI delusions.  Too many ill-gotten gains to be made by the shysters hyping it like that revolting faggot Sam Altman.  If they actually wanted people to buy in to all this AI nonsense, at least go with the angle that AI can be used to reduce/eliminate immigration/H1b.

                That was a thought that passed through my mind when the furor over the H1B visas arose.
They could have sold the $500 billion Investment in AI as a way get rid of the foreigners.
One white man with one AI machine can do the work of a 100 pajeets, etc  would have the base on their feet chanting “USA, USA, USA”.
In the mean time, we need those damned pajeets to develop the AI.  Win-Win.

        My grandfather lived to 97 and thought he had lived too long.  His last two years were not pleasant ones to say the least.  I have never read anything from these people on how to reverse aging joints.  What good is curing cancer if you are stuck in a wheelchair at 125 because all your joints are worn out and you can’t handle anymore replacement surgeries?

            “The Golden Years,” of retirement are one of the biggest lies in GAE culture.
That is because, for most people, there is a huge range of activities that are no longer physically enjoyable, or even possible when they hit 65+ years of age.

                    Lost in looking to the next life, trying to be an angel, is the fact that discipline makes you a human being in the meantime. Hedonism makes one an animal, and after the fun is over, the animal is back to scraping out an existence.
At the other extreme is the self-styled best living the good life thanks to slave labor, but that’s a different matter.
In all things, seek the golden mean!

                In the field of watercolor painting, there was a legendary teacher, Edgar Whitney, who taught until he was 94.  One of his many aphorisms: “The ignominy of age is decrepitude–the ignominy of youth is ignorance.  If you prefer agility and ignorance to decrepitude and wisdom you sentence yourself to misery half your life.”

                    Haha. Or maybe it was the Silents. I can’t keep up with all these different generations. That’s just a lot of divisive bullshit. There were no “generations” in the current sense until I was well into my twenties. Only wipipo are susceptible to this shuck and jive.

                        This statement makes me think you’re either early Gen X or a Boomer. There was a song called “My Generation” a hit from the Who in 1965. Jesus talks about generations. The Chinese talk about generations.Ironically, “This is divisive BS and generations don’t exist anyway” is about the self talk of a couple of generations.

                                    No problem. What I was referring to was this theory of 4 generations completing a cycle and the naming of generations as if these were rigid categories.

                            The term generation as used in the Bible often refers not to an age cohort but to a race of people descended from a common ancestor or having a particular cultural characteristic (e.g., the Scribes and Pharisees as a wicked generation).

                                If true, that would make the word “generation” a gross mistranslation. We would need the word “nation” in English.The full sentence from Jesus in Matthew 16 is “A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah”Does substituting “nation” in Matthew 16 make sense, particularly in context? Is the whole nation through time wicked and adulterous? Or is Jesus referring to the people standing in front of him, who yes were also Sadducees/Pharisees?

                                    The NT is an English translation of a Greek translation of an Aramaic or Hebrew original. Precise meanings sometimes are elusive and depend on context. From what I have read, the term generation is one of the words depending on context  and scholars note that the context of the English word generation is sometimes indicative of the meaning I suggested (particularly in the OT, which can be translated directly from Hebrew without intermediary languages). An NT example is Christ’s comment that“this generation will not pass away until all these things take place” [the end times]Mt 24:34. Clearly this refers to a future group of people, not that of his lifetime.

                                        “Precise meanings sometimes are elusive and depend on context. “We come back then to needing a different English word, consistently modifying an English word, or avoiding a translation altogether. (The last happens all the time in English.) The approach offered strikes me an attempt to redefine a word. We have a word that means springing from one set of ancestors, which is a nation. Unfortunately the question of if the word “nation” made any sense in that passage was left unaddressed.“his generation will not pass away until all these things take place” [the end times]”The prophecy in Matthew 24 intertwines the end times together with the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. By outside Biblical accounts, the destruction in 70AD was devastating. Indeed no stone was left unturned. The generation did not pass away before they heard of all those things and lived to see what would have seemed like the end of their world. In other words, Jesus said it and it happened.

                    I hadn’t heard that phrase IRL in ages. My grandfather (b. 1900) said it a lot, as did my great grandpa. Then I heard a variant on it just yesterday. My Zoomer kids texted me and suggested we take my bride out for a belated birthday dinner. The text started something like, “Hey, Dad, let’s go out and spend our inheritance.”

                    Wasted youth isn’t such a bad thing if you learn from it, and if you aren’t completely bailed out. A lot of shallowness and naivety in society on account of the, well, conservative and successful people imo. Too much tolerance of the ne’er-do-wells, also.
Being that lessons can’t seem to be passed down, a kick in the pants for everybody might be a good thing.

                    aint that the truth, tho?  It doesn’t help that society confuses and enstupifies young people further so that most don’t get their shit together till their 30s.
There was a book that argued that the 20s were the decisive decade in someone’s life in terms of dictating lifetime accomplishment and that is quite right.  Unfortunately, most people in their 20s, even bright people, DON’T KNOW SHIT!

            One of my grandmothers, who lived to be 96, had a health crisis in her 80s which required hospitalization. After which, her mind went, and she was without it for her final decade. I’ve always had the idea that medical science extended the life of her body beyond what it otherwise would have been, but was unable to do so for her mind.

            My dad turned 86 last September.
Last year he did a full kitchen rehab with my help. Sometimes he couldn’t hold a drill.
He said it was his last one, but as a hard headed Bohemian, we shall see.
He is afraid that the minute he stops “doing things”, he’s toast.

                        Not a bad end plan—except don’t bite the end of a barrel.  The trauma is too great for family and first responders.  Instead, shoot for the heart (buy a pistol).  A loud explosion, followed by a brief moment of realization, then shock and light headedness and it’s over.   20 sec’s max, no pain, minimal messiness.

                                Good as well.  There may be a dozen more ways.  The one I mentioned—wrt shock—I’ve experienced twice.  Both times lucky enough to pull through, but neither time did the experience scare me.  Amazing what the body can do under shock, but it’s not painful or even disturbing

                “He is afraid that the minute he stops “doing things”, he’s toast.”
He’s right.  My father never retired.  He very much liked working, especially after my mother passed away.  All your planned projects will be completed (or possibly abandoned) within a couple of years.  Then what?  Sit around and watch TV all day?  My father was in remarkable condition for his age.  When a retiree falls into that bad life of TV and small chores around the house, they decline quickly.

                    Sometimes, at that age, the mind may be very willing, but the body is no longer cooperating. At almost 69, I can feel it starting.

                        This.  The mind is everything.  The struggle is less physical than mental.  All I can say is keep at it.True story.  When I got a bout of Covid some time ago (2nd I think), I was laid up for 8 days or so.  In short, complete bed rest, little physical activity except hitting the toilet.  Day 7 I saw the end of the disease had passed.  Day 8 I got up and was completely well (no symptoms) and good to go.However, I felt odd.  I sat on the couch thinking, what’s wrong here?  After a few reflective minutes, I realized I was no longer in pain.  Weak, yes, but pain free.  Why?  Well, all those muscles and joints that I pushed everyday without end were now pain free because “inactive”.Then I realized that life is pain, pain is life—at least at the end in old age. Nothing at that point was more tempting than to turn on the tv and kick back at my “good fortune”.  I then knew why so many of the elderly simply give up and become sedentary.If you have a choice, don’t become one of those who give up.

                        My father did work that was both physically and mentally challenging.  He was an electrical engineer, by education anyway, and he worked repairing and maintaining industrial equipment.  He might have to climb 60 foot in the air to work on an overhead crane or lift 100 pound wheels from an electric sideloader to get to the control parts. A lot of physical work and mental exertion with the diagnostics.

                Many people fear this. And with good justification. Idle hands are the devil’s workshop and an idle mind is a demon’s dungeon.
I’m not elderly, but I can see that day coming. I fully intend to stay busy as hell in an attempt to stave off decrepitude and senility for as long as possible.

                This eternal life lunacy has been a scheme of this world’s elite families for a very long time. They are obsessed with keeping their grip on this planet, and the way to extend their rule indefinitely is the Ray Kurzweil route. Babel Dos.The coming AI enhancements, both cognitive and physical, will produce supermen and superwomen with abilities and powers far beyond the un-enhanced. This will begin at elite levels because the cost, at first, will be prohibitively high for the rest of the population.Extrapolate from there. This is madness.‘The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.’ (Genesis 11:5)Yup.

                    Since Hell’s function is organic formation–rather, the breakdown into essential elements that precedes formation–my deepest suspicion is that Hell is trying to bypass or supercede the traditional methods.
A new form of life is struggling to be born…“What rough beast slouches towards Bethlehem…?”
Its aims, as are White people themselves, are trans-terrestrial; that is, a stage to flee the Nest, in an organic replay of Creation’s radiant panspermia. One could see it as either a redundant necessity, a back-up sporing, or one could see it as an attempt to break out of quarantine.

                The movie these technocrats have fallen in love with:
“Transcendence” (2014). In this sci-fi film, Depp plays Dr. Will Caster, a brilliant scientist working on artificial intelligence. After being mortally wounded, he transfers his consciousness into a computer, which leads to unforeseen and far-reaching consequences as he gains unprecedented power.
Not a bad movie, but you can imagine these guy’s racing to that point in technology.  My one immediately thought was how a mind without the sensory input of the body can remain sane.  You’ll need to watch the movies for that aspect.

            I never understood why people (Alex Trebek is a good example) who have stage 4 cancer in their late 70s and “decide to fight it”?
Appreciate the time you had, man. Unless our supergeniouses can figure out a way to cure everything and reverse aging, I generally think once you hit 70 you’ve basically won at the game of life, and are on bonus time now, and thank God for the bonuses you get.
Of course, this is really easy to say when you aren’t 70.

                    Yes, this.  Normal people like us don’t have a conception of the life of the rich and famous.  Endless money, constant adoration, fun, sex, and adventures. . .
at a certain point they figure they’re too special and rich to die and death is for the little people.

                I am in my seventies and I agree 100 percent.
The obsession of the body, from birth onward, is survival.  So the body reacts with panic to impending death.  There are no exceptions because we share the same biology.
When I no longer can do for myself — and that time is coming soon — it’s adios baby.  Off to see Papa again.

                    Ray, the solution to your quandary is to not conceive of the body as concerned with survival.  In the book, “The Selfish Gene”, the point is made that the body is simply a mechanism for one’s genes to survive.  Once done—via reproduction—there is no use for the body.  In that conception, no one dies who leaves offspring.

                    I’m 74.  The idea of being dead no longer bothers me, but the process of becoming dead scares the c**p out of me.  My mind is still good and I suspect it will be operating at full speed and with complete clarity, so I will get to experience every moment of becoming dead.

            If someone had taken out Gene Rodenberry before he got to “Star Trek,” we wouldn’t be having half of these problems. The damage that Hollywood sci-fi has done is incalculable. People really believe we’re going to live on other planets, live to be 1000, run marathons at 250 — they should all be institutionalized. Instead, they have billions if not trillions of dollars at their disposal, because human beings are suckers for a good story.

            I have an uncle by marriage who’s grandmother lived to be 101. She never said a word to anyone despite the fact that she had all of her marbles and she was ambulatory. We tried striking up conversations with her at family functions and she either never said a word, or she would issue one word answers. One night she slipped away in her sleep and I asked my uncle after the funeral why she was always so quiet. He told us that everyone she knew, her husband, siblings, friends, way of life (music, literature, morals) are all gone. He said that she told him on several occasions, “David, I don’t know why I’m still here. I wish the lord would just call me home and be done with it.” she never spoke with any of us because she knew she had nothing in common with any of us. It wasn’t personal, she thought you were good kids, but there’s an almost seventy year difference between you and her.I got it, but it was unfortunate because I would have loved to have heard about her experiences growing up. She remembered when Franz Ferdinand was murdered, as well as when the Spanish Flu swept through the country. Gone forever.

                I’m no centenarian–far from it–but feel much the same as your uncle’s grandmother. I simply feel I have virtually nothing in common with 95 percent of my fellow AINOians and therefore have no desire to communicate with them. Attempting to do so is an arduous, albeit somewhat necessary, task.

        I have to say I don’t think you can be too cynical about AI and silicon valley in particular.  I really don’t believe that Altman believes for a minute any of his bulls**t hyping of AI.  One thing he’s trying to do is keep the AI hype high in hopes of cashing out on stock options in an IPO of OpenAI.  He’s also hoping to sell a bunch of computing resources and software to a bunch of gullible corporate types before everyone realizes ChatGPT is just a glorified auto-complete that plagarizes content from existing webpages.  Here’s an interesting video discussing past silicon valley bustouts and how AI is just the latest iteration of the scam:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOuBCk8XMC8

                            When I was a little kid, there was a kiddie diddler in the neighborhood. Everyone knew it, but no one could prove it. Forensics in Flyover Mayberry were not very advanced. One night, he just disappeared, patio door left open. The cops didn’t put much effort into it. And the kiddie diddling stopped.
Yes, there used to be a mechanism for dealing with those who destroy moral society.

                        Of course he is. There’s a whole layer of people who float from Mountain View to Austin to Manhattan who keep coming up with “brilliant ideas” that they somehow convince rich people to finance. I wonder about the mentality of the financiers. Of course, it might be like people who buying a small amount of some new shitcoin in hopes that each of the $0.03 coins will reach $1000. I’ve done it myself. I think of it as playing the lottery. Of course you’re not going to win – but you might. If that’s how the financiers are thinking I can sort of understand. The real question is “do the ever floating grifters  understand the deal or do they believe their own bullshit?”. Maybe everybody knows that it’s all basically a legal numbers racket. It must be nice to be oneitherside of that racket!Now if you’ll excuse me I’ve got to finish setting up this new website I’m starting. I call it “pets.com”…

                He’s gay.  I can kinda understand a man who was born very feminine being gay.  But these “normal presenting” gay males trouble me.  It must be some sort of mental disorder that masks extreme trauma and/or an extreme sadism and/or masochism.

While fusing neural intelligence and electronic intelligence sounds promising, who provides the electricity to keep the computers going? 😏

                    “God created us and therefore we are worth the saving” is far more motivating to me than naked attempts to appeal to saving our flesh alone. The statement gives hope and meaning to the necessary sacrifices that are coming. The hope that my children might be not just another white cog in a never ending wheel, but future residents of Heaven helps too.

Your statement is deeper than you realize…”just another white cog in a never ending wheel” is the essence of their stunted vision. Not being fully White, they can’t hear the celestial song of Heaven, nor envision any eternity but the endless Wheel of earth.

            Yeah, there are a few very scary short sci-fi stories out there about the consequences of being digitized, and then being a digital slave to the people who control your electricity and computing power. I think there’s also one about some poor sod being endlessly duplicated as a “base AI” for a whole bunch of menial, servile computing tasks — countless copies of him living forever in misery.

        Simply being remembered was a form of conquering death.It was and, in many ways, still is the point of life, yes. In a world where those who are worth remembering no longer procreate, gadgets are employed. In a world that no longer values and produces worthy art in all its forms, gadgets are employed.A world where you watch your son become a man is a world worthy of life. A world where painters, composers, authors, and the creative thrive is a world worthy of life.A world where Sam Altman is the ideal is one that distracts itself with fantastical quests for immortality.

                            It never fails to impress me that people cannot imagine we are living in a novel age. The discrepancy between the power the government has and the average prole is greater than anytime in the past and is accelerating. Couple this with the dispersal of power through managerialism (whom would one strike, anyway?), and the prospects seem dreary for any escape.

                                Don’t give into despair. Without the points of the spears, DC is a bunch of senile old farts telling each other stories. Those spear-points are, almost to a man, no longer the Boomer oppressors.
However, if Boomer Hate is an effective tactic for turning them, I’m all for it. Does anyone know any FBI or ATF or even State Police that’s worked on? Or are the golden handcuffs the real oppressor?

                                        No, I think further fragmenting is a horrible idea. I’m saying that if it works, I’m OK with being tossed under the bus. I highly doubt it will work, and all the internecine squabbles are going to end up diluting what little we have.
The best I can say of Theodoreet al.is that they might be the unwitting servants of Satan. That they are his servants is beyond doubt, though. Fruits, you know.

            They won’t need drones once they force Neuralink on everyone.
This is because all Neuralink units will have a small shaped charge explosive that the algo in the data fusion center can trigger via Starlink.
Wouldn’t take a large charge to go through say, a spinal cord.

            The Silent/Boomer generation has an uncomplicated relationship with technology. In fairness to them, they lived through an era where basically magic happened every decade or so. There’s no reason from their POV to not expect the “bugs” of mRNA to be ironed out. Other people are little more cynical.

                It would shake the very basis of science if the bugs could not be ironed out. mRNA is how the body works. Or at least that’s what we think now. mRNA is just a blueprint for producing a protein. The tricky part is getting the proteins to fold. Currently, they just Frankenstein functional snippets together, most of which don’t work, either. But it’s largely that we don’t understand folding rules.mRNA at this level of understanding is crazy-stupid to use in almost any non-terminal situation. Maybe another 50 years. Maybe. To call for mRNA Part Deux at this time is beyond mere stupidity…

        That tech bro weirdo who is getting blood transfusions from his kid and has a team of scientists try to de-age him gave up on one of the medicines because it likely did more harm than good. Death is a part of life. It’s one of the first things that philosophers in all traditions discovered and expounded upon. These dorks cannot change the basic reality of God’s plan just because they have money. They’re going to learn it the hard way and are learning it the hard way.And I would argue that AI can’t even create clever memes. People were able to figure out what is generated by AI within weeks if not days of the tech rolling out. AI cannot create, it can only duplicate and iterate upon what humans can do. Elon Musk said a few months ago that the AI models they have today have been trained on all the information that human beings have ever created. In other words, they will now need to be trained on themselves, which is a catastrophe for AI.

Death is a power greater than God.
All the universe is a function to defeat Death, all the imagings of a sentient God are of His attempts to defeat Death.

        ‘Lost in most of the AI debate is something Altman said in that clip, “Immortality is not too far ahead.” That is an interesting selling point, as it assumes that everyone wants to live forever’Only the greatest of fools — or of salesmen — would want to endure such a horror, a horror almost beyond imagining. Me, I can’t wait to get this evil orb in my rearview mirror. Not one minute more here than is absolutely necessary.But the tech idjits eventually will get their way:‘And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.’ (Rev. 9:6)That was written about 2,000 years ago. How could the author (Patmos John) know that human beings would reach such a point? Well because God told him, and because people — and the race itself — are quite predictable.The eternal life offered by Christianity has NOTHING to do with this scheme to prolong living forever by the billionaires and techies.  The Christian eternal condition is a gift of God to the righteous, it is not a for-profit strategy by those with intelligence devoid of wisdom.

Most every morning, I take a walk outside, up and down the driveway, with my dog, and I marvel at how miraculous and beautiful the earth and heavens are.  The wind in one’s face, the sound of birds, the sight of the clouds, stars and moon.  It’s an absolute miracle.  I will miss it when I pass.

        People who are familiar with the fundamentals of computer science and the fundamentals of neural networks and still imagine that they somehow embody the potential for eternal life are first order determinists. They make the most hard core HBD race-realists look like the cast of an olden-tyme coke commercial. How does one make that colossal mental leap required to go from a multi-variate transfer function that has been manipulated to give certain discreet outputs for certain discrete inputs to imagining that increasing the scale of input / output assignments eventually crosses some threshold into consciousness? They must think the secret ingredient to conscious intelligence is the ability to be wrong. If something so mechanically mundane were true, what value would ‘eternal life’ have that would inspire one to seek it?

        The Norse/Germanic mythos of Valhalla and Ragnarok and the final battle encode the wisdom that these megalomanics in their ignorance miss. The end, yours and even the universe, is inevitable. This is not a cause for sorrow. It is a fact that must be greeted heroically and honorably – side by side with your people making the most of the time you have.Of course it also encodes the wisdom that we must do battle against entropy. Looking at Larry Ellison and Bezo’s new tail are instructive.And as always our host hits on a subtly related point. High interest rates and consumer-eyeball tech has created no more alpha. They know this. So they are turning from an indirect subsidy of ZIRP fueled IPO “wealth” multipliers to the direct subsidy of military spending. I bet a lot of the war in the clouds is over who is going to get the contracts.Will it be Palmer Luckey and that crowd or Eric Schmidt and that crowd? One thing is for sure, no matter what Alex Karp will be getting them and sharing them and the data with his foreign domicile of choice. I suspect dragging in Ellison and Altman (which drags in Microsoft by default), is throwing that faction a bone to placate them for giving the Musk/Luckey/Andreesen faction primacy in the coalition.We are in the final stages of the grift. Interest rates just can’t go down. So write them checks directly instead.In closing, the Indo-Europeans from whom we came really had the most important questions answered. It is Occidental Man’s social/spiritual technology that is our great achievement that enabled all of the others. Kurzweil and that gang are bereft of that soul fire so they are going to keep digging in to an endless bottom.

            “Indo-Europeans” is about as a solid theory as “Judeo-Christian”.  Can we please ditch the theory before our new Indian overlords remind us who is the first modifier in “Indo-European”? It’s not going to end well.

                Interesting point. Judeo-Christian is not a theory it is a propaganda tool. Indo-European is not a theory. Pan-European? Occidental? I get your point, but we have the claim on it. We know via DNA, linguistics and archeology where they originated from and who they conquered. Food for thought. I am not discounting your concern, but we are in an existential crisis that is also an identity crisis.
A major part of the dispossession project is abrogating our claims on our lands and our origins. I know what you don’t want to do. What do you propose instead?

                    “We know via DNA, linguistics and archeology where they originated from and who they conquered.”I will politely disagree here. We don’t know these things. The linguistics is probably the weakest point. It involves a few syllables, of which they seem to be common throughout the planet. Almost every language’s formal or informal name for “Mother” is “ma”. The Indus river valley had an advanced civilization that seemed to have completely vanished. It’s not like the Mediterranean Sea with semi-continuous written records etc. It’s not possible to come up with historical DNA records, as we really can’t test bones very well. Most of understanding of human DNA involves testing people with well known genealogies.It’s literally just a theory with almost no evidence behind it. The evidence is so thin that I’d call it wishful thinking.“but we are in an existential crisis that is also an identity crisis.”Very much agreed.” What do you propose instead?”That God made us and for that reason alone we have value as nations and individuals. Our identity has to come from our God given family ties, simply because God gave them to us. That means our children and parents come first before “saving the world” or any other do-gooder motivation.  Personally, I tend to believe  “Indo-European” is about avoiding the concept of God.

Where can I learn more about this? I thought it was through testing Neanderthal hair and bones and such that we had a rough idea of how much of H. sapiens DNA was Neanderthal. You are saying that can’t be done with far younger fossils?

I think I searched “DNA testing post mortem”, therefore making me an expert. *grin*Anyway, it is very difficult to sample DNA from just bones. Human DNA testing, relatively speaking, has to be done within about a year of being deceased. Otherwise, there’s too much potential interference and not enough intact flesh left. We’re talking chemical strands so small that they might be looking at recent bacteria that was living on the bone instead of human DNA. Calcified DNA is particularly difficult sample properly.My guess is that you’re thinking about the pre-DNA era that focused on finding patterns in bones/skeletons, itself a dicey pursuit. There’s no guarantee that Neanderthals are related to us because their skeletons were similar.

                                    I didn’t say it was impossible. I did say getting DNA bone was very difficult and therefore relatively unreliable and expensive. There is a reason that people aren’t gleefully digging up bones to figure out family trees.There are 3 bones in used in this survey, none bigger than a finger bone. One of them was a bone recovered in 2010 from some random cave in Siberia. Who knows if that bone was evenNeanderthal? Perhaps it was some poor Russian? (So many questions. Were the bones even attached to a larger skeletons, etc)In any event, an Institute for “Evolutionary Anthropology” is about an open political agenda. This report is about hours spent on almost nothing of base evidence. But when the job depends on coming up with family trees on zero evidence, that’s what happens.

                            Piffle really needs to do some reading as opposed to pontificating that which he has little knowledge of.David Reich of Harvard has developed the technique of DNA recovery from 50k yo wisdom teeth.  He has an ongoing project of DNA analysis on such from digs. The last I read he’s got something like 200k samples from around the world and of varying epochs in human history.  Read his book:”Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past” (2018)Others using his data have draw some pretty strong conclusions of past human populations and migrations as does Reich in his book despite what Piffle claims.

                            Very much agreed. I want to see Europeans embrace their parents, which means thinking about being Irish, English, Scottish, Greek, Romanian, Hungarian, American, etc again. That’s my vision of the immediate future that would restore the West to health. I am aware of the campaign by our overlords to erase such distinctions. I still think we need them back.

        I don’t see how a glorified search engine with walled off virtual intelligence limiting its ability to use the data it holds can help make organic beings become immortal.There’s already calls for the medical industry to ban so called “AI” for being able to detect race from x-rays of ribcages because White people will use that to oppress black astronauts. Can’t use it for policing because it hurts black people’s feelings, can’t use it for anything even vaguely eugenic because all genes are equal, especially the ones responsible for antisocial behavior.Dysgenic supremacy is implicitly the guiding principles of the West &amp; even if the focus is on achieving this through tech how can the brown hordes afford it?Now I wouldn’t put it past the government to subsidize robotic negroes who have armored skeletons to help them survive the perils of typical bantu behavior. I’m sure if its developed quickly enough before the average IQ drops so low that maintaining running toilets becomes impossible they’ll do it. Like everything else though this will be subsidized by the ever shrinking population that financially contributes, rather than siphons from, society.There’s no reason to think the paradigm of elevating &amp; protecting the dysgenic will cease so this will no doubt be the focus. Maybe they can make robots that can repair themselves, they’ll also need robots to mine &amp; ship the materials around &amp; install the aforementioned negro ballistic/crash dummy armor.I’m sure the H1B visa immigrants we’re going to be flooded with can build these things, worked out great for Boeing after all.This is like planning an add on to your house while theres a live cracked gas pipe right next to the pilot light. I mean that basically applies everything about our society so ya know, whatever.I never thought the looting phase of the dying empire would involve scammers claiming we’ll become the Jetsons as a guise to extract wealth, clearly I’m lacking in creativity. In fairness to myself I’m merely a tourist of this clown show, I was born into this world, I didn’t make it.

        From theRevelation 13:“15 The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 16 It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.”John is clearly talking about a world authority or leader which commands the construction of an image of an animal or human and it gives breath (life) to this thing. The result is worldwide deception and control. And anyone who refuses to submit to acknowledge the authority of whatever it is (AI) will be killed.Drone technology, CGI and the use of DeepFakes today proves this is no longer the world of science fiction. This is real possibly which could be implemented in our own lifetime if not our children’s.Denmark has already eliminated cash transactions and the current generation is perfectly fine with using smartphones for their day-to-day transactions. But smartphones as we know them in their current form haven’t really changed much in 2-decades. People are starting to get tired of dragging a “clunky” smartphone device around. Which is why there’s a push for wearable devices. But even that is somewhat impractical and has it’s limits.Enter implanted tech.Implanted devices are nothing new and have proven themselves highly effective and relatively easy to use in the medical and health care sector. How much of a stretch is the idea of these devices being used by governments to accommodate cashless societies and to identify and control their citizens travel and movement. Given the craze with many young people to embellish themselves with tattoos, the idea of being injected with tech isn’t unreasonable or even objectionable. It may even become desirable and could be easily promoted by YouTube influencers, actors and others like them. We all know how easily people can be manipulated by social media platforms.This sort of tech doesn’t need rechargeable batteries because we will be the power source. You can read about self-powered medical devices and energy harvesting in the articles linked below.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X2400035Xhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/energy-harvestingThe Chinese have a well known and effective social credit system that has proven to be relatively easy to implement and socially and financially effective to control it’s people. Just look at what’s going on in the UK with their Orwellian government and massive surveillance state. One does not need to stretch their imagination very far to imagine the EU could very well implement this sort of system in the next decade. Especially since the technology already exists and they’ve already tested the waters with Covid.

            Yes, this exactly. Been obvious for many years that the Scriptural Image of the Beast will have a strong AI component. Likely, a mix of bio-human with the Enhancements.When the implant Enhancements become commercially available — and that’ll be soon — they will be sold via invitation to elitism, as the Enhancements will create people who in various ways are superior to the Old Human models.Do human beings have a potent desire, an obsessive desire, to be ‘better’ than their neighbors, a superiority — even a supremacy — that is available for purchase at the click of a link? They damn sure do. Then the race will be on, and the stratification will be not only money, but AI upgrades.

            Revelations is a weird book. Originally credited to John the Apostle, but everyone who studies it says they have very different writing styles. It provides a horror tale like a good old campfire ghost story. Many-headed monsters!  Secret symbols!  It seems to me the message of the New Testament is pretty straightforward and is not dependent on solving mysteries within mysteries combined with numerology.

        There is a penalty for living too long. It calls to mind the Ship of Theseus. Replacing yourself gradually over time with the new, and the possibility for endless renewal, you become something you begin to rebel against. It’s possible for you to become something you begin to detest. The only answer is to actively reject the replacement of yourself.There is the vampire genre of literature. The problem of the vampire is his immortality. Not a big fan of Anne Rice but she portrayed in brilliantly. I think living beyond your time would be deeply unsatisfying for the hedonist. It might be acceptable to those more intellectually inclined but only for a time. Even these would succumb eventually to a profound ennui. I knew an old man once who fought fiercely for the little bit of time he had left. He argued that he wanted to see what would come next. Ironically, he died just before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, an event that he had been prophesying for years.

                    Seems thataway logically, but that’s because we apply our experiences of time to the eternal condition, where there is no time.  Where there is no time, there is no boredom.

        Talk about maximum hubris!  The human body is orders of magnitude more complex than anything produced by these tech boys, and really, it shouldn’t work…Trillions of operations are going on each second in your body, and any significant failure rate would kill you..Based on my past life regressions, and millions of others, the soul is immortal and we do have a choice to reincarnate…But for the atheists among us, the question is why you would want to live past 100, in a worn out body often confined to your bedroom…Because entropy (2d law of thermodynamics) is constant, and everything wears down to zero in the end…

            Keep in mind that physical laws are descriptive, not prescriptive. The Second Law describes the situations we’ve observed, but it is not engraved on immutable stone tablets. Disordered states are more numerous and probable than ordered states, but life itself defeats that reality at least for a while. Many scientific advances involve extending the length of time that we can hold entropy at bay. That might not be forever, but it can at least be a longer time.

        “at this stage it is mostly used for creating clever memes”It is mostly used for fraud, scams, and spam. As should be expected from a product that is designed to convincingly imitate humans and the products of the human mind. AI proliferation has made the internet significantly worse, and it’s starting to make the real world worse too. Miles of the most beautiful scenery in the country, near me, are slated to be bulldozed to build power infrastructure for an AI datacenter. Destroying real squirrels to replace them with pictures of AI squirrels.These tech dorks are more of a threat than the wokesters ever were.

        Thought provoking post.In my opinion, not a single person who ever drew a breath, wants to die. That said, I’m getting to the point where I’m starting to understand suicide. No one ever wants to die; what they want is whatever is happening in their life, that is overwhelming, to stop.I’ve had a good life. Not perfect, but a hell of a ride to say the least. The thing that is starting to overwhelm me is the suffering that is on display every day. It’s in our face. And the people dishing it out, are doing it with impunity.It makes me wonder why, as Z pointed out, some would want to live extended lives, or forever.There is a movie called “Bicentennial Man”, that was about an android that, over time, became “human”. He had the ability to live eternally, but choose death, because he realized he was outliving everything that he loved.Finally, I have a question for the gallery.It is my opinion that after death, one of two things happens. Either;A) Oblivion-the plug is pulled and its lights out, you don’t even know you existed,orB) There is something “after”; Heaven/Hell/Reincarnation/and any other “awareness” of being dead, but existing.I often wonder if I’m missing a third result. If anyone can shed light, I would appreciate it.

            I’ve been a Zen “adept” (as practitioners are known) for more than 60 years and what might be called your “third result” is that your individuated self experiences a combination of A &amp; B. To wit: your individuated identity consciousness is dropped, either voluntarily or through extinction; if the former, consciousness survives in a transcended but non-individuate manner, in the latter, well, lights out or maybe reincarnation. The ground belief behind this is that all simplyIS,individuation is illusory as is time.

                    Agree with Piffle. The “why” evaporates. The Hindu concept of sinking into an incohate mass is a horror to us; that to escape pain, the ultimate purpose of life is to become a rock, or an ooze, or smoke, or a fire, with as much meaning or thought?
To rise from an ooze only to become one again; why then happen at all? Why suffer suffering?
This reduces us to a meaningless churning without purpose or direction. What comfort, what explanation, what drive is in that?Anything is permissable, because nothing matters, there is no difference between good and evil.

                Thank you Bartleby and Montefrio; there is a continuance, a something real enough to be measured; Montefrio gets a bit into the mechanics, the specific “how”, in part, of how that something functions. Parts of us remain while containing the whole of what we lived. Holographic storage rather than linear, collective yet still retaining individuality…for a time.Immaterial as well as organic; the two forms are necessary redundancies of each other.
In short, no, we don’t just go “poof”.Life, a biosphere, occurs to overcome that “poof”.We are the essential froth to spark the Universe’s cycling.

            I can’t think of a 3rd option. It’s either sleep forever or something after death. I didn’t come back to Christianity because I wanted eternal life. I just wanted to fill a gap that existed in this life.However, if we ask the question why God might want humans to have eternal life, we could borrow the answer from a particular carpenter from Nazareth. “Even Moses demonstrates that the dead are raised, in the passage about the burning bush. For he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.”.In other words, why would God make a bunch of dead people? What’s the point? No, we are eternal creatures that need to suffer death as well. Given a world of suffering and just general fallenness, however, death can be seen as a blessing. Wanting to live forever on this planet is insanity. Wanting eternal life in general is just an alignment of human desires with God’s.

                    Yes, I agree. It was not a foundation I understood, though, until long after regular church going became a habit for me. I had to work through many issues. People come at Christianity through endless angles and doors. Wanting eternal life was not one of mine.

            You have the choices.  I recommend (B) and coping with the doubt.“Wishing that God may exist, and acting and feeling as if He did exist. And desiring God’s existence and acting conformably with this desire, is the means whereby we create God—that is, whereby God creates Himself in us, manifests Himself to us, opens and reveals Himself to us. For God goes out to meet him who seeks Him with love and by love, and hides Himself from him who searches for Him with the cold and loveless reason. God wills that the heart should have rest, but not the head, reversing the order of the physical life in which the head sleeps and rests at times while the heart wakes and works unceasingly. And thus knowledge without love leads us away from God; and love, even without knowledge, and perhaps better without it, leads us to God, and through God to wisdom. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God!” (Unamuno)

                        Sure, but the difference between a Brahmin and untouchable is a matter of wealth and class. It’s not like the Brahmin has been promised no pain, illness, bad fortune, suffering or been exempt from witnessing all those things.Actual Heaven involves “no more tears” to borrow from a few hymns here and there.

                            Christian heaven is very different from the Hindoo or Buddhist conceptions.
There is neither rebirth nor reincarnation in Christian doctrine.  No passing through millions of incarnations, only to start again at zero.  Yeah great, thanks for crushing my spirit.  Lots to look forward to there!
And Nirvana is just another dead band.

                            Not really.  The Indian families have selected for millennium those of the same or higher castes to intermarry with.  Wealth is a proxy for intelligence.  Hence through assortative mating the intellectual ability of the caste is risen.This theory has been shown in the book by Clark.“The Son Also Rises” is a book written by Gregory Clark, an economist and historian. The book, published in 2014, explores the role of intergenerational persistence in determining economic and social outcomes over long periods of time. Clark uses data from various historical and contemporary societies to argue that social mobility is far slower than most people think and that family lineage and inherited traits play a significant role in determining success or failure.Similarly, Reich concludes much the same in his book reference above.  Don’t let the concept of “inherited traits” detract from the real finding, IQ superiority of the higher castes.  There are things that can’t be openly spoken of in the academic circle these two authors must traverse.

                                Being wealthy and being on the deep end of the genetics pool is not all there is to life. Does all of that prevent even the supposed wisest of them from suffering death? Does it stop a cold or a cancer? Or your beloved toddler from an accident? Most of the people you’re talking about aren’t apparently high IQ enough to “get” that their vegetarianism is holding back their overall health. How many high caste children don’t exist because their protein sources are suboptimal? And that’s the “smart” people in India.Your post unfortunately demonstrates my point about missing the bigger picture. The wise/rich and the poor/foolish can only look to the grave and there’s only suffering along the way. Hoping to reincarnate as a Brahmin is no hope at all, which is why they have to add a destination that’s something like Heaven but not really.

                                    No one spoke about Indian beliefs.  Certainly not I.  Only that in the case of the Indian caste system that was created a millennia or more ago, it worked to maintain and improve the racial stock of the caste and explains much of the differences found among castes.  You maintained the differences were basically *environment*, i.e. cultural and SES.  In short, take an “untouchable” and raise him in a different environment and you can produce a Brahmin.You are simply mistaken and your analysis is completely incorrect as shown repeated through the same misconception we have had here in America for more than three generations.  We’ve spent billions and the races have never converged.  Neither will the castes in India, because *genetics*.Also the book “The Son Also Rises” takes most of its findings from the West, specifically British records, and has nothing to do with Indian caste system, but rather the development of smarter people over time via outbreeding the poorer.  That’s basically how we came to the Industrial Revolution via a form of Darwinian selection.

                        Spot on, Zoar, although these folks seem to forget the whole “resurrection” angle, and how integral it was to the Hebrew model from the very beginning.
Reincarnation, I’ve read, was commonly accepted in the early Church days until excised as not useful to the Church’s nascent ruling class. They wanted the power to threaten with finality.
As to the Hindu model, yup, they only kept a piece of it, warping their extrapolations…same as with the Hebrews.

                            “whole “resurrection” angle, and how integral it was to the Hebrew model from the very beginning.”The religion of the Israelites (Hebrew was only a language they spoke and it was not spoken in Jesus’ day) only slowly revealed the idea of a general resurrection. It does not formally appear anywhere in the written Scriptures until the very late OT. It does come up in Psalms indirect way.“Reincarnation, I’ve read, was commonly accepted in the early Church days until excised as not useful to the Church’s nascent ruling class. They wanted the power to threaten with finality.”Reincarnation was never accepted in the early Church. Jesus never talks once about reincarnation. I know it can feel like Christianity is about power trip. Ironically, that’s the Marxist view of all religion. However, Christians through time are a group of people who are dedicated to the love of truth, which is love of God. I can tell when people have read about Christianity from secular academics who could careless if they are getting correct versus interacting with the material itself.

                                Yes. The chosen Son of Father, Christ, identifies as the Truth, capital T.
When we sincerely seek after the truth in this world, and follow along it, eventually we end up at The Truth, which is the Lord — Jeshua. He is both the source and the destination of all truth.

                Please, folks, a warning to all in your final days: there will be a day your body takes over, you will be gabbling, consumed with terror. It only lasts a bit, so to the ‘no fear’ types, don’t be surprised, it’s only your body talking.

                The problem is perhaps not the aspect of death as the final outcome, but the process of death.  Most of us know of those who died in seemingly painful ways, more so I suspect than knowing those who passed painlessly and without much suffering.

                    My experience is quite different. I know only a few who died in pain. One from emphysema, the rest cancer. One I’m absolutely positive checked out by taking extra morphine. The look on the nurse’s face when she was collecting his meds was all it took to confirm my suspicions.Most have checked out in their sleep. This includes most of the pets I’ve had. My mom might have been “assisted” by dehydration, but most of my kin have been up and moving around no more than a day or two before the end. Including my dad, who died about a year ago in his late 90s.

        I’m speculating but perhaps ideas like the ones Richard Morgan floated in his trilogy (Altered Carbon, Broken Angels, Woken Furies) have some traction with the Tech Bros — a future where consciousness itself has been digitised.As for the trends in AI and other massive computing projects, they leave me disturbed. To my mind they are anti-life. These projects require a massive amount of electricity and mineral resources at the expense of the biosphere. We already know this from bitcoin mining. There’s a good recent essay at NLR on energy and mineral consumption which is quite revealing:https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/exponential-abyssTrump himself is a pawn — probably an unwitting pawn — in these massive projects. Meanwhile, according to Mike Whtney writing on the Unz site, the Chinese may already be far ahead of the Tech Bros in these efforts, and at a fraction of resource use:https://www.unz.com/mwhitney/chinas-deepseek-bombshell-rocks-trumps-500b-ai-boondoggle/

                That’s an impressive theory and possibly what is actually happening. It would be wonderful if the camps were divided over how to use AI but if this is the point of friction you are right, it boils down to control.

                That’s what the one who isn’t Thiel but also appears on Rogan’s show says. (Knowing nerds’ names is against my religion.)
Governments want this new technology—I don’t see the novelty of it, but it doesn’t matter if it’s really there or not; they believe it—used for political repression and insider economic gain. The “bros” want to use it to end beauty and humanity and civilization forever.
They seem to have reached a compromise.

                Supposedly the thing that created the Musk-Trump-Bezos-Zuckerberg axis was the realization that the Entity-that-controls-Biden also wanted draconian controls on AI.

                    Whatever AI is, it seems to be the ultimate ‘yes’ man/woman. It tries to agree with everything an interlocutor asks except for certain tabu topics. Then it spews out the boilerplate pozzed nonsense of course. I would like to see a Based AI incorporating the American Pravda series compiled by Ron Unz. What we have now is a “patch” after the alarm created by the OG Raciss AI, which was amusingly spontaneous.

                        Gab actually has a number of different AI persons you can talk to. They don’t seem to have any qualms about “morally questionable” characters so you can chat with Hitler or Attila any time you like. I think if you pay for a non-free subscription you can create your own AI so perhaps you can feed it on a diet rich in Unz or whomever. I don’t know much about thequalityof these AIs of course. In general their AI seems weaker than ChatGPT but I expected that since they don’t have the money the CGPT has backing it.

            Annihilation has no terrors for me, because I have already tried it before I was born -a hundred million years -and I have suffered more in an hour, in this life, than I remember to have suffered in the whole hundred million years put together. There was a peace, a serenity, an absence of all sense of responsibility, an absence of worry, an absence of care, grief, perplexity; and the presence of a deep content and unbroken satisfaction in that hundred million years of holiday which I look back upon with a tender longing and with a grateful desire to resume, when the opportunity comes.…Mark Twain

        Technology is teleology. If a thing can be done, it will be done, if there is an advantage in doing so. On a long enough time frame, no moral or philosophical objection will prevent anything which is truly useful.This is why I fear that the Panopticon is inevitable. It is simply too useful to TPTB. If we must have tyranny, then at least let be a tyranny which has as its object the preservation of my people and culture, as China does for the Han.However, if everyone becomes a Kurzweillian cyborg whose “defects” are corrected with CRISPR, bionics and nanobots, let alone a disembodied consciousness in the internet ether, what’s the point of any of it?As in the Iliad, the gods may come to envy mortals.

        A random thought for the readers:  Do you guys remember Elizabeth Holmes and her wonder test that would be able to diagnose any disease you might have from a drop of blood?  She was a democrat/power elite darling until the fraud was pointed out.  I wonder if her “test” was going to be the original PCR test for 2020?  She started getting press in the early 2010’s and had Kissinger on her board.  If he had lived, i believe that Kerry Mullis, the creator of PCR would have spoken out about its use and Faucci.  Convenient he died when he did, but just a random thought and dot connecting i had the other day.

                lots of big names:Henry Kissinger (former United States Secretary of State);Jim Mattis (retired Marine Corps four-star general);George Shultz (former United States Secretary of State);Richard Kovacevich(former CEO ofWells Fargo);William Perry (former United States Secretary of Defense); andWilliam Foege(former director of theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention).With regards to covid, lots of people are thinking it was a DOD operation.  Lots of DOD names on that board.  And tech people do, trying to engineer their dystopia of everyone having a digital ID and vaccine passports with CBDC?  Thought exp.  If you’re used up all easy to access resources by pursuing endless growth, and you’ve jacked up the population of the world but all the low hanging fruit are gone, and you don’t have enough cheap energy left to accommodate the illusion of endless growth anymore, logic would suggest you start trying to convince people that they should forgo a better lifestyle.  Be poor, save the planet!  And if you can’t convince them of that, kill them with a jab that will take a few years to manifest and nobody would be able to blame it on you because they’ll all have moved on with their lives by the time it hits?  Who would run a program like that?  Seems to me it would fall to the military, they’ll be dealing with the chaos anyways if people did find out.

        I would prefer a healthier life rather than a greatly extended lifespan. I also don’t like the mRNA technology they are touting as one of the keys to this longevity. It is dangerous and we have been down that road before. The tech oligarchs also seem to be sold on AI mass surveillance, another abomination. We didn’t vote for any of this stuff, nor to incorporate Greenland and Canada into the USA or to seize the Panama Canal. I hope Trump is not serious about this stuff; he needs to keep his eye on the ball and ignore this distracting crap.

        Real immortality is mathematically impossible. But life spans counted in centuries rather than decades would be nice. Once we get that (if ever?) some will want millennia instead of centuries. Seen as dementia is already a common problem after say eight decades, that suggests the human brain doesn’t have the memory capacity for such life spans. So now they’ll have to expand the brain.I doubt it will get that far. Modern creature comforts aside, our behavior is still very close to that of chimps. We fight each other all the time. If China reached immortality escape velocity, I’m sure the NSA would try to crash it

        Ah shoot. I forgot to mention a point about Larry Ellison’s claim to cure cancers with self-tailored mRNA; odd that he should be gibbering about curing an explosion in cancers, conveniently after those very cancers were induced.

        The struggle to prolong life is all over science fiction and the sense is always “long life is a monkey’s paw”. It’s harder to prolong joy than suffering, and living in an imperfect universe becomes hellish as you watch every young generation coming up make the same mistakes again and again and again. In theory you accumulate wisdom, but what you really accumulate is regret. It’s all variations on that theme.The guys who talk about reversing aging are more interesting but that’s also tied into it in the fiction : men at 300 years who are still functionally in their 40s, who can barely function from the emotional weight of all the human nonsense they’ve had to deal with.It’d be cool to live longer, in good health, but functionally there has to be a limit, because living here becomes a Hell even if you could get everything you want by doing it

            It would require a real mental/emotional pansy to be incapable of adapting to longer life with a good body. (I don’t dispute that a great many qualify.) Do you ever see that “inability to function due to the emotional weight of all the human nonsense they’ve had to deal with” in the centenarians of our time? Yeah, me neither. The opposite, usually.

                Cause most centenarians are well aware they’re at the end of their life, there are no more expectations on them, and they’ve either done everything they want to or have decided they wouldn’t have liked it anyway. But imagine, for instance, being 150 and still having to get up for work at a job you thought you’d be done with 30 years ago I’d everything panned out but it never quite did.Old age brings wisdom because there is some urgency in learning from your mistakes, and part of that wisdom is letting go of a bunch of stuff you can’t change. If being a centenarian meant you were still in the prime of your life, you’d probably still have trouble grasping that wisdom.

        It is interesting, the DC judges are flatly refusing to honor Trump’s pardons, and are sentencing people still. Other federal prisons are transferring pardoned people to the middle of the nation and dumping them out penniless with no id. So its a direct challenge to Trump.Also, there is brewing the Sam Altman vs. Elon Musk fight. Altman remains the pool boy for Linkedin Reid Hoffman, who was sorry Trump was not made a martyr. And remains a poo-flinging lib. I would expect Altman and probably OpenAI (its not open — its Hoffman/Gates/MS) to be tossed out of Project Stargate.Already you are seeing the Resistance congregate, around Elizabeth Warren, definitely on the Warpath.Reading the Ross Douthat interview via Archive.is on the NYT with Andreesen, yes the managerial blob from employees to Fortune 500 CEOs started to scare owners by threatening to take over their entire companies. This is inevitable — the ambition of Warren is unbounded (who through appointing most of her cronies and former staff to it controls the DeBanking Goverment org — Consumer Financial Protection Board — debanking is done by telling banks the person is “controversial” and will result in extra scrutiny). Of course she wants to run every company. Of course the Managerial blob will tell Silicon Valley there will be no AI free for all, just a few run by Warren or some WH staffer, all big companies, textbook definition fascist stasis corporatism. Laungishing like Franco and Spain in the early 1970s.But the biggest issue is War. Peace is over, if you want it. All we are saying, is give War a chance. Larry Fink is now saying that “xenophobic” nations like China, Japan, South Korea are enjoying more wealth and power, and that demographic decline is not a concern there, because of AI and robots. And that the West hooked on phonics and cheap labor, is falling behind, not only in standard of living but productive capacity.War with China, coming as they take over Taiwan, North Korea flattens South Korea, and China also takes Guam, southern Japan, parts of the Philippines, and probably Hawaii and the Aleutians, will be a mass industrial war with all that implies. Massive technological and manpower mobilization. Greenland: needed for resources. Annex Canada? Get resources and manpower. Annex the UK, manpower and an unsinkable aircraft carrier. Europe? Too far gone to add anything. This is resource, territory, manpower consolidation of a national empire knowing its current resources, military, industrial capacity, are fake and gay.

            Trump should just ask for volunteers from the US Marshals for a special MAGA operation. Maybe they would guess correctly, but to keep the deep state swine from screwing it up (like they did with Homan’s op) keep everything on the down-low. Their mission, revealed only in the vehicles en route, is to arrest every stinking judge and attorney ignoring the pardons. This includes the chicanery at the DC prisons. Liberate the pardoned, toss everyone working there into the cells, and deny them bail until their cases come up sometime in the Vance administration.

                The prison in my childhood hometown let freed inmates out at three a.m. because that’s the time that would most inconvenience whoever was picking them up, and if they had no one to fetch them, everything had been closed for long enough that nobody was driving around to hitch a ride with, and no hotel or motel would let them in.They were always released without identification, which was already in the mail to the address thereon, where they might not have lived in years and definitely hadn’t kept up their rent.The guards especially enjoyed tripping last-day inmates into other guards and beating them almost to death in retaliation for the “assault,” then shoving them out into the night, sometimes unable to walk.When the marshals in your plan found out what they’d signed up for, they’d mutiny.There are no good cops.

Considered by his devotees “the Socrates of Moscow,” it is said that Federov’s philosophical formulation was cultivated through an Orthodox Christian perspective which is odd, because he seems to have completely abandoned it in favor of other schools of thought percolating among the intellectuals of that time.”The video below will give you an excellent primer on all this stuff.

        The two inescapable facts of our existence are death, and taxes. If death is eliminated, that leaves just taxes. Is science pursuing the solution to these as well? I’d really like to know because I can’t work much longer. I’d dread living forever in some digital workhouse or debtor’s prison. Maybe we’ll be the happy few sent to Mars for that other entirely sane idea (also promoted by the Donald).

        This probably won’t be a popular post and might be a bit rambling but here goes. I’ll say that I actually think the quest for life-extension (I won’t talk about immortality**) is a good thing and represents a nice turn towards what you might call retro-futurism and away from dreary totalitarian Green dystopias where everyone is only allowed so many kWh of energy per day and has to live in a mile high bug-hive.For too long the Left has dominated people’s vision of the future. The assumption here seems to be that because Leftist cretins have propagated a vision of technological progress enabling their particular coercive ideas of “social progress” that it must be so. Life extension just means people living longer and hopefully being healthier for longer. Everyone seems to attach their own ideological baggage to it and then forms their view of it from there. Somehow “could be” becomes “must be”. You see this with virtually every topic that has anything to do with science or technology. The climate issue is another example. If you grant that human CO2 emissions account for a lot of the measured warming everyone, Right, Left, and Woketard, assumes the need to confiscate all the muscle cars and force everyone to eat bug-burgers.This very discussion is another example. Somehow everyone assumes that “mind uploading” is the central idea of “immortality” while ignoring the much more plausible and sensible idea of simply extending the span of healthy living.immortality**: And this is a further example of what I mean. Once you introduce the idea of any sort of “infinity” you have all sorts of bizarre paradoxes to resolve. Look up “Hilbert’s Hotel” for just one. This is not necessary to the discussion of life extension though.

        A lot of wisdom in the comments, but I find life less enjoyable at 50 than it was at 25. If somehow a rejuvenation tech (that clearly worked) became available, I’d happily pay if I could afford it. Eventually I’ll die by misadventure, so the threat of living forever seems remote.And if a cheap mass manufacturing method could be devised (like for the hated MRNA poison) the profit margin would be immense – better than narcotics. Lets say you could get 1 year’s worth of rejuv/de-aging for $50,000 each, people would be lined up around the block dropping hundreds of thousands. De-aging 10 years is easily worth half a million bucks for anyone upper middle class or higher.

        For someone who generally has a good grasp on things upon which he opines, I am disappointed that your understanding of Christianity is so superficial and frankly wrong.  Good people don’t go to heaven.  There are no good people.  Heaven is populated by people who humbly accept the gift of eternal life provided by Jesus, resulting from His atoning sacrifice.  I am sure this will cause no end of scoffing and harrumphing among the smart set of atheist followers of your blog, but I don’t care.  It’s worth it to tell the truth.

            Good people don’t go to heaven. There are no good people.You are surely correct that “Good people don’t go to heaven”, but we need to handle that assertion with care. In trinitarianism, Jesus is supposed to be fully human (Heb. 2). He is, or was, one of the people. Therefore, given what you repeated about there being no good humans, it follows that Jesus was not good, which is just what we ought to have suspected as soon as we learned that he affirmed Israel’s torah(s) and other elements of tanakh. So Jesus did not go to heaven, and in fact our science has shown the alleged ascensions of Jesus and Elijah to be ridiculous.Beware of appeals to egoism. They’re dangerous snares, like “this Constitution”, a populist document which begins with an astonishingly successful lie.

                That’s why you have to parse that “original sin” stuff a little closely. People were born vulnerable to temptation, and all but The One has failed to resist temptation. Some sects interpret that concept way too broadly. Seems silly to pretend that somein utero“clump of cells” had sinned just because of the pronouncement of some holy man a millennia ago.

        I recently happened to rewatch a short-lived 1970 TV series called The Immortal — Christopher George plays a regular guy who learns he is not aging and his blood can confer this same health and longevity on others. So he’s on the run from an evil tycoon who wants to buy him or imprison him if need be for that blood. Thinking about all this at 70 raises deeper questions than when I was 15, but the series barely hints at these issues, veering off into a pale copy of The Fugitive.

        The whole conversation about “AI immortatlity” always makes me think of the Mechanicus faction of Warhammer 40k, or “Otherland” by Tad Williams – a strange series of books I read in the 90’s.

        I realized that the British are taking on the Hebrew or Israelite role in the narrative–a people who brought the light to mankind but are now becoming the darkness.
The same could be said of their Colonies.
