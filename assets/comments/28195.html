        Ranked choice voting does something else that is corrupt at its very core. The old rule is “One man, one vote,”. Now it’s one man, multiple votes. There is no risk in voting for your favorite because you then get to vote for your next favorite (or against someone else).
That hag in Alaska and the corrupt gope set this up so that she would win. It also says, vote for the gope candidate or get a liberal.
The concept is anathema to America, but since America is collapsing anyway, well, I suppose it’s just fine to burn.

            It is also from the outside extremely difficult to audit.
The issues of complexity seem intent on promoting vote fraud in multiple ways.

        Grifting and the vast amount of campaign, PR, and other consultants that make money off grifting may be the only thing saving us from brutal rule by fear and terror. Its clear from the Dark Brandon speech that the people running Biden want to rule by fear and terror and to quote Z-Man want the purging of the Kulaks to begin. Immediately per Jen Rubin.But that ends the grift. If it is a uniparty then there is no reason for the grifters. No PR consultants, no campaign consultants, no war rooms nor spin zones. Its just the ruling faction as in the People’s Republic of China eventually degenerating into dynastic Communist rule like North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, etc. All those donuts, just gone!This probably explains the fear/horror of the political class to the speech and its rapid memory holing. A push-back against the Pol Pot like purges because that would hurt the grift. They might even have to work. At real jobs. If it is a uniparty where candidates just get anointed by a very few insiders like China. Don’t see campaign consultants in Beijing now do you?Which offers an argument for us to the Grifters — they need a Trump reformer to purge out the True Believers who want the Dead Kennedy’s “Holiday in Cambodia” as a guideline for the new Great Reset. Let em know that they’ll all work hard for a bowl of rice a day, so to speak, if they don’t move to remove the current Regime and get Trump in pronto as the only option to spoil the whole game for them.Patriotism, honor, decency, none of those have any impact on grifters but the probability being high that the True Believers in the Part and White House will create North Korea on steroids and themselves if not purged will be cleaning toilets or something is powerful motivation.

        America is like a rich junkie with lots of fake friends. They take turns recommending that she try this or that fad diet, go to some “wellness” class (that they happen to run as a side hustle), take up knitting, join a gym, hire a life coach (“did I mention I’m a life coach?”), etc… None of them ever dares to suggest quitting heroin.

        When did the political system become such a rotten grift? My first thought is when the Clintons slithered out of Arkansas with his gang of charlatans, paired with an end to the Cold War. I know these two seminal events have been discussed before on this site. Less than a decade prior, Reagan won with 49 states, indicating a broad consensus amongst the people that this guy was selling something everyone wanted (the wisdom of that is, of course, a different story). However, by the mid-90s, that seemed an impossibility as these charlatans said the way to win was to rile up your base against the other base and use that to drive GOTV efforts (with the added benefit of dividing regular folks into two camps that fight each other nonstop). With every chaotic event that occurred afterwards, to this day, politicians can act with impunity and seek out the biggest payout because no matter what they have 49% of the electorate on their side, by hook or by crook.

            Reagan massive victories were the American people stating that they were fucking over the 60s hippie bullshit and civil rights shakedown.  They wanted AMERICA again!  It was a happy time and a lot of people thought it was just the beginning.
But the real Powers that Be were appalled at the happiness and success and vowed to never let that happen again.  And so it hasn’t.

                It’s very difficult to overemphasize the act of meta-treason which was W-41 reneging on his solemn “No New Taxes” oath.I can clearly &amp; vividly remember the moment I walked past a newsstand in the summer of 1990, and saw that headline, and experienced the instinctual feeling of impending doom, as though a ton of bricks were piling up on my chest, and my windpipe were restricting, and I couldn’t breath.It’s fascinating how our instincts – the genetic memory of hundreds of millions of years of our ancestors’ sacrifices – scream out to us at these crucial points in history.When we know deep in our gut that something horrible has happened.

                    you missed his “1000 points of light ” speech introducing “the new world order ”  ? He basicly told us all that “hey rubes, we’re tired of being secretive, there’s nothing you can do now to stop us anyway” . which was much more an admission of treason as the no new taxes crap.

                It was the first time any children of ’60s parents were old enough to vote.I was too young to know the polls, but I remember that the stereotypical conservative in fiction was a college student, son of rich hippies, who was portrayed as betraying his family/The American Dream/etc. by being a preppy Reaganite (a pro-war libertarian, basically). The son’s riposte to his parents was always that they had committed the *primal* betrayal by selling out and becoming a wealthy “power couple”—as if that lifestyle is the default and only morality can prevent it—and so how could he have grown up to be anything *but* a Nazi?Strange times. Not good. Never trust anyone who says they were.I recently heard a confused old Frank Zappa fan wondering how Frank would now “reconcile” having hated, more than anyone else, both the hippies and the yuppies. As Frank said at the time, they were almost all the same people—the worst generation (yet).

                Four words: George Herbert Walker Bush.  This SOB happened.  I still wonder whether the relationship of this demon with John Hinckley’s pappy has something to do with Hinckley shooting President Reagan.

        Someday, I hope that the so called “right” stops worshipping the Constitution. Along with the Declaration of Independence, a wartime document penned by Jefferson to appeal to leftist French sensibilities. Both are enshrined as holy documents in D.C. Once we start to realize that all the high minded nonsense memorialized in these “holy founder” documents was due more to the avarice of the “founders” more than any profound wisdom, the sooner we can affect changes. I know, all leftists are crazy “harpies”, but maybe, just maybe, some of these people have a point. Sooner or later, some adults have to enter the conversation.Best Regards,Mike

            Personally, of the founders, Jefferson is my favorite. Burr being the true favorite, but whether he is a founding father is contentious. I say this as I agree with Mike. Just look at the crooked new York banking that Washington and Hamilton schemed. That’s why I like Burr, as he scammed the scammers woth that water company scam. In short, the founders created de facto monopolies that benefitted them. And yes, if I recall Jefferson even signed his letters as “Citizen” for a while to lend support to French revolution. I do not think the founders are really that far away from the current cabal. Our current leaders just rule over a more degenerate populace. Well, our founders were smarter, too.

        It is assumed that the wealthy are smarter, more knowledgeable, than the rest on account of their ability to succeed in the one sector closest to the hearts of men in North America.
Because the rich are “smarter”, there is no revolt against them. Common jealousy doesn’t operate. You would think that the poor and middle class would feel a burning hate in their gut for all those yachts and sports teams owned by a select few. But because the rich are “smarter” you can’t begrudge them that.

            Intelligence and wealth are highly *correlated* so be happy or unhappy about this as you wish.
Intelligence is largely inherited anyway as is wealth as is height and good looks and sports ability and just about everything else.
Hierarchy and inequality are good things… we just have a sorry class of foreign oligarchs rather than a well bred class of native aristocrats on top.  The physiognomy of a Schumer, Nadler, Zelensky, Kissinger, Garfinkle etc is enough to tell you that smart or no, these people cannot deserve to rule anything but a peddlers cart.

                    “Ruling has nothing to with deserve; just force.”Sorry to tell you this but whatever your other merits youve taken on one of the central assumptions of primitives and degenerates.There is no virtue but power is an idea for jews like Marx and degenerate kiddie diddlers like Foucault.  Your ancestors, OUR ancestors believed in hierarchy and recognized God given natural superiority AND the framework of accompanying reciprocal obligations to the inferior.The idea that its all just self interested power scheming is the free market idea generalized applied to all human relations.  Because many of us think like this we’re now incapable of acting collectively with moral certitude.

        I was home a few minutes for lunch and I saw your Substack review and could anly readu the first couple of paragraphs. But thank you for telling me that I’m not the only person who thinks Will Ferrell is the exact opposite of funny. When he was seemingly everywhere I just had to keep my mouth shut when one of his movies came up in conversation. Everyone else thought he was the funniest ever.  He’s not only unfunny but he always came across as kind of mean and as a bully. Thank you  for that.

            Will Farrell seems to appeal to white guys who lived in the suburbs in the 1980s.  I lived in c steal tampa, but I get the appeal.All his movies are some kind of nostalgia trip imoAnd he’s sort of the gentile answer to Jewish comedy.That said, I think he’s funny as shit.  He is one of the few guys both my son and I like, which is probably a lot of it.  But I didn’t like him at first when he was on SNL where I thought he was weird and had some kind of psych issues going by his eyes.

                    Macdonald never made me laugh, to be blunt
I’m surprised people don’t think Farrell was funny.  Step Brothers had me laughing for years.

                    MacDonald is the GOAT as far as I’m concerned. He was brave for a comic, he would try anything and if it worked it was wonderful. If not, move on to the next one. His comedy was not mean either.
There are several Conan clips that are classics: the Courtney Thorne-Smith interview, the porpoise joke (made up on the fly) and the moth joke.

                        I never watched the simpsons or family guy either, could never be bothered, so I wonder if there is some overlap in the style of comedy.   Comedy is a matter of taste.  And Macdonald  never appealed to me, as with simpsons, family guy, etc.  but I loved beavis and butthead.  Thought step brothers was hilarious. Liked the first anchorman. Thought elf was ok.

That kind of politician might be fine for NoVA but personally when I see someone with ties private equity, let alone having the run of the Carlyle Group, that’s automatically disqualifying (yes, Vance and Masters too). I will not support our billionaire class’s adventures as if they were a bunch of doughty Ayn Rand children’s-fiction heroes– these guys are essentially thieves and welfare queens.

            Master’s is as close to the real deal as anyone can be and get as close to office as he is.  Even if he finked it would be a huge symbolic victory for him to win, he’s much worse/better than Trump and represents significant overton window shiftVance is almosr certainly an insincere grifter but it would probably be a good thing if he won too.  Republicans even giving lip service to the real right and winning opens major doors for better and better candidates in futureAnd sure the voting process itself might fail and turn out to not matter at all, Id bet on that… but potential candidates are also potential national leaders and we absolutely need visible national leaders for progress electorally or totally otherwise.Its also important for Normie to hear badthinkers not just surviving but thriving, few will give up grilling on the promise of being ineffectual pariahs.

        Whatever happened to R. Emmett Tyrell? He was the Richard Spencer of the late 70s and 80s. Rich, patrician type (real or not I don’t know), started a college magazine called The Alternative (cf. Alternative Right), bought the rights to The American Spectator at an estate sale or something. Benefited from/took credit for Reagan, gave P. J. O’Rourke a perch after he got too “conservative” for the National Lampoon, etc. Both cultivated a “the new cool is right wing” kind of vibe. For example, it was published as a tabloid, like Rolling Stone. Interestingly, both eventually became standard glossy 8×11 magazines around the same time, and ceased to be relevant.

            Tyrell is close to 80 now and maybe not in great health. The trouble with the legacy sites like the Spectator, American Conservative and even Chronicles is they remain liberal publications. They operate from the assumption that the old liberal order can be reassembled. Most people moving out of conventional politics do so knowing that there is no putting the old order back together.

            Now that you mention it, he did play a Spencer-like role during the Clinton years. He was the public face of the vast right-wing conspiracy, and he embarrassingly self-immolated.
His name still appears on a Spectator column every couple weeks. The last few I’ve seen end with a ritual “Glory to Ukraine!” It’s him in spirit if not in fact.

        I gotta believe America was a country at least somewhere before the 1960s; or maybe I’m just too brainwashed by TV/movies of that age.  But I still dig Leave it Beaver and John Wayne.My feeling is that a country is worth fighting and dying for is one that gives a shit if I believe in God, get working, get a home, get married/kids (young), and doesn’t throw me in with a bunch of aliens.Maybe it’s too much to ask from any mass society.  People are very limited and can barely get their own shit together.  I admire to an extent the Amish or Orthodox who at least take care of their own and show that they give a shit in just the basic ways that matters to human beings.  You want to help a struggling boy?  Teach him a skill, get him working, and hook him up with a PYT.  Don’t give him pills or send him to some shrink, or even worse, fucking idiot school and rotting away in classrooms.Santino was right:  “Your country ain’t your blood. Remember that.”

            You touch upon something of paramount significance: the Global American Empire does not give a damn about anybody outside of the rather tiny power &amp; influence class. You and I are just numbers to those who rule the GAE. We are no more than taxpayers/consumers to them. We are not genuine human beings with hearts and souls. As such, we merit not an ounce of loyalty from them. That of course begs a question: considering that they demonstrate no loyalty to us, are we not fools if we maintain any loyalty to them? When enough Dirt People wake up to the correct answer, the system’s end becomes inevitable. Have we reached that threshold already? I have no idea. But it’s possible.P.S.: It should be further noted that close to 100 % of those who continue to place faith in “America” are non-Jewish Whites (which is not to suggest that there aren’t plenty of non-Jewish Whites who have lost all faith in “America”). Are the custodians of the system not taking serious risks by continuously demonizing the only group that possesses a high degree of investment in that system? Setting short-term gains aside, is it really a good long-term strategy for the system to consistently alienate those who are most dedicated to it?

                There was a funny meme I wish I could find.
It showed Uncle Sam graciously giving a sack of cash to a black hoodlum who replies, “Fuck you, cracka motherfucker.”
Then Uncle Sam graciously gives a sack of cash to a Mexican illegal who replies, “Fuck you, gringo.”
Then Uncle Same sternly takes a sack of cash from an old white boomer who salutes and replies, “God Bless America.”

                “American Empire does not give a damn about anybody outside of the rather tiny power &amp; influence class. You and I are just numbers to those who rule.”
They don’t even feign caring any more.  They just want us all suicided with vaccines, weed, crack pipes, and porn!
But it begs the question: how can they care?  I just don’t grok how a mass society can work in the way we’re talking about.  At a certain amount of people; we’re all just strangers.

                    fakeemail: You’re absolutely right. What incentive do our rulers have to look out for our welfare? The kindness of their hearts? Various traits help rulers obtain and preserve power; kindness can rarely be counted among those traits. The only thing that would motivate them to look out for our welfare is if they somehow perceived that it was in their own interests to do so. We are not even in the same stratosphere of such a scenario. At best, our elites will be indifferent to us. At worst — and  closer to the actual reality in more cases than not — they will view us as obstacles to the expansion of their already-ample power.

                        It’s even worse than all that even.  Imagine a virtuous man runs for high office because he does care about others, cares about the truth, he does want to uplift his country spiritually and materially.At least half of the population will HATE him.  They will hate him because the media tells them to, for sure.  But there’s something else.  A large amount of people are simply nasty and vicious.  They WANT to be fucked over and ruled by criminals.  They WANT to see the good guy lose and get crucified even if it means they will be damned as well.  They are evil and do NOT WANT to be saved or uplifted.  They want to see something good, beautiful, or strong be destroyed.Never forget the classic Jim Morrison rant:“You’re all a bunch of slaves! You’re all a bunch of f*kin’ idiots!  Let people tell you what you’re gonna do! Let people push you around! How long do you think it’s gonna last? How long are you gonna let it go on? How long are you gonna let them push you around? How long? Maybe you like it. Maybe you like being pushed around. Maybe you love it. Maybe you like getting your face stuck in the shit!  C’mon, you love it, don’t ya?”

            There is no such thing as a free market. There are markets, which are created by and maintained by men. Like any other tool, the utility lies in the hand that wields it. Give a simpleton a complex tool and he will make a mess. Give a craftsman a simple tool and he will make do. The prudent use of market tools in distributing goods and services is good public policy. Turning government over to highwaymen peddling wares to the unsuspecting is no way to run a country.

                Someone has to decide who the, “prudent”, men are. I think what you describe brings us back to the dilemma of the American Founders. Once you give centralized power to a select few, they will abuse it. However, someone has to have some authority to make decisions that protect the polity, (the nation), from hostile outside actors and benefit the people who make the nation a nation. This is true whether those given that power are the same people in terms of race and culture, or a different people as evidenced by the original central bank of the US and the history of the West.In our time, that line is divided by those who explicitly recognize the nation state as the sancrosanct polity vs. those who do not explicitly recognize it. Underpinning all of the rhetoric about race and diversity and gender identity, fascism, white supremacy … is Trump who champions the Nation State, and the blob that champions the International Bazaar in the shadows. The tool you describe could be the regulatory regime of the administrative state and the monetary regime (the central bank), of the administrative state. That tool is not a free market force. It decrees the cost of money and intervenes in the market to set it.That tool is what enables this endless parade of, “disruptors”, who peddle an endless array of inanities as the society worships the Great God – Disruptor. That tool enables the massive tech firms to gobble up new entrants using their scrip whose value is inflated by the zero/negative interest rate regime.I agree about the highway ware peddlers – it isn’t just the government – it is the entire system. The question is what is the remedy? Whoever can establish the remedy and describe the devils and details of the failure and the appropriate successor system is who will create a movement with legitimacy and compel the people of quality to join it in sufficient numbers to be effective.The closest thing we have to that right now is End The Fed. Most people here probably came here from that point of departure but see that, while a lot, this isn’t enough of a program. But, it is a big part of it. Saying the tool is great but you need the right craftsman to wield it, oh by the way, I am the right craftsman, isn’t good enough. It won’t compel the sufficient numbers of the right people to cross the channel, and it will get usurped by the same people who wield the credentials and currently sit at the helm – the existing regime. Will Normie take the Harvard/Wharton/Yale MBAs or a Dirty identitarian? Maybe once regime legitimacy is totally cratered, but how long will that take?The questions of both who and what require good answers. One is useless without the other.

This is another notion in favor of the ethnostate. If you have “outside actors” inside your country and you are foolish enough to allow them into the control nodes of your civilization (finance, elite education, media, etc) then they will inevitably become “hostile outside actors.”
Some minorities will behave more badly than others when they get into control nodes, but it is human nature that all will make the attempt if they have the cognitive aptitude for it.

                        Having everyone of the same ethnicity is not a guarantor. If that were enough the American Founders would have dispensed with the political discourse, made it only Anglican and called it good.Indeed, Biden is of white ethnicity, yet he cheers and accelerates the demographic replacement of his own race in its own homeland. Countless times, traitors have acted from within to help a hostile foreign power and/or peoples to usurp the existing state.Ethnicity is not enough. However, it is clear that Progressive America first gave up on any notion of a common identity – being an American. At the same time there are ethnic groups and races whose primary identity and loyalty is to their own group or tribe. At the same time, it is illegal for white people to organize and assert their right to freely associate – a concept they invented and expressly created this nation in order to enjoy that right. Given that white people forfeited this right when they were a massive majority, it doesn’t bode well what will happen when we are a minority. A very bad precedent has been set.For the time being, given the current existential threat and legal disadvantages previous generations willfully subjected all of us to, ethnicity may prove to be a sufficient binding force given that the stakes are survival and the ability to survive without being persecuted. In the long term, divisions and strife will surface within the ethnos as they always have. That is reality.The question is, given the current reality, what must be done. I think we here see the reality of the position we have been put in or allowed ourselves to be put in. The people who betrayed us are of our ethnicity. They betrayed us along class lines and without much thought given to the fate that awaits their posterity.

                        “Biden is of white ethnicity…”I don’t consider ‘white’ to be an ethnicity, but as a term that indicates European race.I use the term race to describe variation in the large scale genomic structures. Europeans have some Neanderthal alleles, Asians have a different but overlapping set of Neanderthal alleles, and Africans don’t have any. Ethnicity is more granular and manifested over time as racial elements settled in different locations and differentiated through disparate local natural selection forcing and local drift uncorrelated with that experienced by distant members of the same race. Dutch, German, and English are different ethnicities all of the same European race. Culture (behavior) coevolves with genome, which means it is correlated most strongly with ethnicity.The American founding populations (viewed by state) were all the same race but of different ethnicities. I agree that “having everyone of the same ethnicity is not a guarantor.” Biden is European by blood, but he is not a member of any functioning European ethnic group, baseline European or American. European leftists have not only abandoned but repudiated the culture of their forebears.“Ethnicity is not enough.”I agree. I see it is a necessary but sufficient condition. Having a ruling class of your own ethnicity in your ethnostate doesn’t guarantee that they won’t abuse or replace you, but having a ruling class of same race but different ethnicity usually works out worse, and having a ruling class of different race always works out worse.

                        Hi Horace –You clearly have a stronger handle on genomics than I do. Thank you for the explanations. I am learning.The clarification you and I are doing is critically important as a means of helping people who, whether they know it or not, have been repudiated by their ruling elite. Heck, it is helpful to me.I think another thing we can do is use the proper terms as you did by pointing out that Biden, and the entire ruling regime, has repudiated his race, his ethnicity and his nation. Repudiation is the perfect term. Well said.That means that he and the regime have renounced their legitimacy by the act of their repudiation. Why more heritage Americans don’t see this and react with alarm is concerning. Good discussion here.I think for the time being, any person who does not renounce population replacement and all of the other forms of anti-white racism in by words policy proposals and enactment is a repudiator and thus illegitimate. Asians fighting to end Affirmative Action and any other racial legal privileges and discrimination are legitimate and should not be pushed away in favor of an ethnically pure coalition. That is my view. We have too many of our own fighting against us, to lose key battles for the sake of ethnic and racial homogeny.

                Zman, if you had written today’s piece ten years ago and I had read it back then, my reaction would have been the same as Din C. Nuttin’s. I used to worship devoutly at the altar of the so-called free market. These days, I am reminded of Matthew 7:16: “Ye shall know them by their fruits.” While Christ was speaking of false prophets in that verse, the same reasoning can apply to systems. Though the fruits of marketism have been greatly beneficial at times, they increasingly appear poisonous on net balance. Civilization won’t last once it has become little more than a vehicle for incessant grifting. That communism tends to produce appalling evils does not somehow erase or excuse what are proving to be the long-term ills of marketism.

                Free markets. like the bill of rights, and the 10 commandments, don’t work if they aren’t enforced.  When they are enforced (were enforced) they caused the greatest prosperity the world has yet known.  The Magna Carta was also a good idea, invoked by the threat of swords to limit the avaricious and capricious actions of a despotic king.  It lasted an entire month before said king colluded with the church, the other authority, and voided the document.  The Constitution was a great idea.  It just needs enforcing.  Someone said the lawyers (and their paymasters the politicians) look at the constitution the way safe crackers look at safes.  Look at Biden right now trying to subvert congressional authority on student loans.  Look at undeclared and unconstitutional wars.  Look at Pelosi’s unconstitutional Jan 6 committee and prisoners being unconstitutionally held.  Look at the corruption in the institutions supposed to be enforcing the constitution, the DOJ and FBI.  When the country fails, it won’t be caused by free markets.

        “ The only function voting serves today is to provide a patina of legitimacy to decisions made by an oligarchy,…” Arshad AliYep.  RCV is a shiny object pointed to in order to distract from the present (corrupt) process.  It’s lipstick on a pig.  There are at least half a dozen serious flaws identified in the current ballot process that were used to “fix” the last election.  All that’s needed is to address those flaws and we’d achieve: 1) a much more transparent, and understandable process, 2) a much less corrupt process, or at least one where cheating would be minimized to a futile endeavor.Z-man has hit the nail on the head coming from the other direction.  The problem with elections today is not the election result, it is in the process which has, little by little over decades been corrupted—ironically in the name of *more* “democracy”!RCV is designed to obfuscate and cover up all the current balloting flaws by denying voters any clear perception of the truly favored popular candidate, force elections to be computer tabulated, and at the same time prevent hand count auditing of election results due to the amazing complexity of the tabulation process.  And as Z-man has pointed out, will as likely produce a “winning” candidate no one likes—which perhaps is the whole idea (see Ali quote above).  🙁

        Ideology frequently opposes marketism. For example, detestable as it may be, wokery is not looking to persuade the market of the value of its wares aside from the D.I.E. mantra which most wokesters don’t believe. The BLM signs on wealthy white lawns are virtue signals meant to proclaim virtue not to promote it in any sort of market sense.  Dictatorship needs no market savvy in a command economy. The failure to take market forces into account frequently spells the demise of dictatorship as may happen here amid the general ruin of each against all being the primary value dictatorship nurtures for its illusory self-preservation.

            I think if you went door to door where those signs inhabit a yard, you would find almost all of them work in healthcare, higher education, government (local/state/federal).  Wonder why that is?  Explains the “divide” between left and right.  As the left as slowly taken over the country they tilted every playing field in their favor via laws and regulations until all you have left are overpriced degree’s and unaffordable healthcare along with money printing because its all an abstraction 😉Also i’d add if you asked whats for dinner, because all those signs say all are welcome here, i’m certain the answer wouldn’t be in the positive

        The real problem with ranked choice is that it tends to exclude the majority candidate in favor of someone nobody likes. So in order to always elect Democrats, you wait for the Rs to flush out their single “winner” then flood the ballot with crappy Ds, and lo and behold, one of the lower-ranked Ds will win, every time. Exactly as happened in Alaska. (California’s “two highest vote getters make the ballot, regardless of party, so always two Democrats” might be regarded as a form of RCV.)RCV only “works” to extract a candidate everyone likes when there is already a strong clear majority. When things are more confused or more evenly distributed, as with American political voting, it always promotes from the bottom, because that’s what’s left at the end.RCV was employed at an organization I was involved with for many years, and I saw it in action enough to realize it was a fraud designed to make everyone think they had more control than they do, while promoting the otherwise-unelectable.

        “Politics is a massive racket run by conmen, grifters and sociopaths who care only about a quick buck.”When was it different in the USA? There have been times when populist sentiment held sway but these have been the exceptions that prove the general rule. Today the only question we need to ask of any American politician is what constellation of special interests owns him (or her). The “political-industrialist complex” is there to manufacture consensus and to get votes from the marks and rubes who bother to vote. But as Emma Goldman pointed out over a century ago, if voting could make a difference, they’d have abolished the ballot box a long time ago.The only function voting serves today is to provide a patina of legitimacy to decisions made by an oligarchy, and to camouflage the deep state mechanisms through which this oligarchy exerts control. On the rare occasions when a maverick arises — such as Trump — and the voters don’t back the establishment candidate, the system either gets rigged or the maverick candidate finds himself hamstrung.The US establishment likes to make-believe that it is both “capitalist” and “democratic.” But at the philosophical level there’s no way to reconcile the two. In practice large capitalist interests own and control the political process, which serves as the velvet glove to disguise the iron hand of authoritarian control beneath. But the glove is now threadbare.

            “When was it different in the USA?”The answer to that question is, just like so many others, “before 1865 and the Industrial Revolution”.In the Old Republic, politics was generally the preserve of landed gentlemen. They were private gentlemen first, as an identity. Politics was something they did, not who they were. Politics was not a means to become wealthy, because there was no mechanism to do so. Men like Washington, Jefferson and Madison actually lost money by becoming President, because the burden of public service interfered with running a plantation.In the Old Republic, there were no Robber Barons like Carnegie or Rockefeller with the financial means to buy politicians in an agrarian society run by landed gentlemen who temporarily acted as politicians out of a very real sense of republican noblesse oblige, instead of professional mercenary politicians like Biden.That changed after the Civil War, for obvious reasons.

                Yes, I can buy that point of view. Same in England. What brought about mass politics (which is all about mass propaganda, misdirection, and infotainment) was extending the franchise to all adults, coupled with the development of mass media (initially newspapers but then radio and television). As long as politics was the preserve of the landed gentry and the urban merchant class, it was a very different beast.

                Indeed, long before the current grifters feasted on Obama’s ethanol subsidies or salivated at the prospect of more solar, wind and EV subsidies, the Lincoln Republicans were drifting down South with their carpet bags to grift the nascent Reconstruction.Noblesse oblige only works in a society that accepts the reality of aristocracy and inherent human inequality. The irony is that political grifting relies on that reality too, but simply divides the mass of humanity into marks and cons. And the majority of Americans have been sold a bill of goods. It’s long past time for the return of a yeomanry dedicated to Jeffersonian self-reliance with minimal involvement by government policies or agencies. I’m not talking about a Libertarian folly ordained by market forces; just advocating that the common good will only begin to thrive again when we look first to ourselves and our kin.

            As I’ve commented many times, America was always a nation of con men. America’s greatest literature revolves around The Big Con. From Poe’s “The art of diddling” to Melville’s The Confidence Man to Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby to William Burroughs to Mad Men’s Don Draper. to Saul Goodman
As Americans say, if you don’t know who the con man is, you’re the mark.

            Voting mattered before the federal government became too big and overreaching.  Because the federal government had little sway over your area of the country, and so voting meant voting for people who directly affected your locality. all that mattered happened within 10 or 20 miles of where you lived.Incidentally, I was reading up on one of the last living confederate soldiers. He was one of the few ever recorded in terms of an audio recording.   And he didn’t even know he was a Virginian!   It was news to him when he signed up.  “I go to sign up and they tell me I’m something called a Virginian…”.Obviously even voting in one’s state didn’t mean much in those days. It was all about your immediate area.  And my guess would be that it was much harder to cheat then too.

        “Chaos is good for business.”It’s also a necessary prerequisite for remedy. Chaos does many things. It creates a fog of civil unrest typically in the form of street protests and mass demonstrations. In the case of Antifa mobs, it also includes wanton violence and destruction of property; typically via arson, smashing windows, and looting. What does this do? Well, it ties up nearly all of the existing emergency services in the big cities where this occurs. Typically police and fire departments are quickly overwhelmed, and if protests persist for days, those resources deplete due to overwork and being spread too thin. No one is issuing parking tickets during a riot and the normal incidences of dispersed crime are necessarily ignored because there are no resources left to address those events. And even when national guard forces are brought in to help, they mostly just create barriers to protest movement and enforce curfews. No one is “minding the store” in the traditional sense, so looting becomes easy and effectively risk free. For the typical ghetto looter, the fog of chaos is your friend. This principle has broad application.

This would probably foil their plans for a crackdown on dissidents.Thanks TomA… could you please make sure and post the same basic thing over and over here every day regardless of the subject matter?

        Reminds me that a Japanese politician – remarking on Coolidge’s quote – said the business of Japan is the Japanese.We are controlled by a group who were bred to parse and manipulate words. It’s why they so hate simplicity. They want to debate every word until their is no meaning other than what they want at that moment.The Japanese know that Japanese means one thing and one thing only – the ethnic people living in Japan. No clever wordsmith can get around that.The marketplace – both economic and political – has taken over because we never had a simple notion of who we were, or, maybe we did and forgot it, so we just go with what’s popular or sounds nice. The American experiment is a failure. We’ve learned that you can’t base a people on ideas because those ideas can be manipulated, either by clever minorities or stupid majorities.There’s no bedrock on which to fall back when the basis of your society is challenged. The Japanese openly and proudly say that the Japanese people are a race, united by ancestry, history and culture. No amount of word play will convince them otherwise. Sadly, this is not true of the various European tribes, but, like us, they are also failing.Societies built around values and not a people are a failed experiment, the likes of which we won’t see again for a very long time.

            In a confident society, there are certain tenets you do not question, not because of some authority but because, regardless of pedantry, there are things you simply know in your bones.  Once a people put these core pieces of identity and seeing the world open to debate, it’s only a matter of time before it all collapses.  It’s not because the new way of thinking is better either, but often simply because it’s more subversive, a sort of mind virus that acts like those flies that burrow into a beetle’s skull and convinces the creature to drown itself.The people most susceptible are the intellectuals, who then try to spread their virus to the people closer to the Earth.

                Intellectuals are the most easily manipulated because they don’t feel a connection with regular people and because they do feel a connection with other intellectuals who are spread around the world.
An intellectual’s world is global and works just fine for them. The faculty are from around the world and their college town is very nice, so they can’t understand why the whole world can’t be like their little world.

                    I suspect intellectuals are easily manipulated because it’s expected of them to think big thoughts. And if your thoughts are no different from those of the hoi polloi, you’re not much of an intellectual, are you?
So they deliberately go in search of thoughts that fly against common sense, thoughts that only fellow intellectuals can understand: any pleb can argue that there are only two sexes, it takes real intellectual edge to argue there are 72 because that’s a much harder argument to make.

                        Exactly.  Your insight also explains the current trend towards “deconstructionism” in the academy (I think that’s the correct term for my observation).  No one prints articles of the known “dog bites man type”, but they do notice and publish “man bites dog”.Years ago as a budding undergrad, I took a “developmental” psych course and was immersed in such topics are child development which lead to reading about breast feeding infants.There was a large review article I encountered which looked at the last 50 years of publications for and against breast feeding and their recommendations.  They ranked the articles as pro/con and graphed them by year published.  Sure enough, there was a highly visible trend over the decades where one decade, there was high recommendation to the next decade there was low recommendation.  Quite literally a “sine” wave.One decade breast feeding was in, the next out, then the next in and the next out, etc.  The question was “why” and the obvious answer was a search edgy *and* publishable studies questioning the current status quo.Yep, “big thoughts” replacing  last years “big thoughts”.  And endless cycle, producing promotion and tenure, but not necessarily extending scientific knowledge.

                        Yep, “big thoughts” replacing last years “big thoughts”. And endless cycle, producing promotion and tenure, but not necessarily extending scientific knowledge.Yes. If you browse the library of any institute of sociology or political theory, you’ll find fifty plus different models of society on the shelves, all from the last 100 years. If you ask the librarian, he will tell you that none of them are wrong or disproven, they’re just no longer used.But if you can find a professor willing to examine you in the subject, you could write a dissertation grounded in any of these old theories and nobody would claim them worse or better than the theory launched just yesterday.A high school science textbook from the fifties could be used today with a few footnotes added, but the market is flooded with sociological literature to the tune of hundreds of books per year and none of them are ever just plain wrong.

                        I was speaking to a woman about a decade ago with two young children.  She said that when the first one was born, she was warned against peanuts and potential allergies.  Just over a year later, when the second one came, the same doctors told her to expose the newborn to peanuts immediately in order to condition him.  If she had a third one, I suspect she was told to avoid nuts again.

            Yeah, well, as Elon Musk pointed out, if the business of Japan was really the Japanese, then they wouldn’t be going slowly extinct via failure to reproduce. The Japanese corporate state has put outdated societal rules and corporate profits above family formation, and will soon be paying the price for it. It seems that Admiral Halsey was right, though perhaps a century or so early, when he predicted that one day the Japanese language would be spoken exclusively in Hell.

                It appears the Japanese are unwilling, and now unable to do anything about the demise of their culture simply by the fact that eventually – no Japanese will show up for the future.  As to why they have…achieved this point is a mystery wrapped in an enigma.  In Kyoto years ago and amidst all the Shinto shrines, I asked my host to explain Shintoism.  He more / less stated a Western, or non-Japanese mind is incapable of comprehending it.   Perhaps they get it and are willing to live (and die) with it.

                AntiDem: Still sore about Pearl Harbor, eh?  Talk about holding grudges based on false premises.  The Japanese live in extraordinarily crowded conditions with minimal personal space.  Rather than crowding even further together like the Chinese, they’ve embraced a bit more individualism and privacy as a result of decades of western influence.
Japan will still exist 25 years from now, and it will still be filled with Japanese people, albeit fewer than today.  The remnants of AINO will not last out the decade.

                    I’m not sure I concur that the alarming demographic trends, the atomization and dehumanization of the typical Japanese, is the result of a conscious desire for space.  There’s something else at play.  And maybe as agaijin, I can’t understand it, just as I may not be able to understand Shinto, but I think it’s baked into what it means to be Japanese.  I don’t think they can help themselves.

                    Yes, Japan will still be Japan in 25, 50 or 100 years.   Demographic decline is the hot thing these days. People like Musk and Caplan and many other clowns think we should live like sardines packed on top of each other and that is the only way to have national power.Japan perhaps is sub-consciously downsizing but they will be fine.   I would take it over the metastatic cancer that is a country like Nigeria.

        Probably the most ubiquitous mindset that shows most people are just a bunch of spiritual merchants is when you ask them about solutions to problems.Lousy schools?  Lack of funding.Water Treatment Plants failing?  Lack of funding.Mass homelessness?  Lack of funding.They never ask how schools operated when the local literally built the schoolhouse themselves and hired a teacher themselves, all while being poor farmers.They never ask why the Water Treatment Plant worked fine on a fraction of the budget when it was a culturally cohesive group of white guys running it.They never ask why funding homeless programs has seemed to make homelessness worse, and their behavior even more detrimental.You see this even among conservatives with their “build your own” mindset, completely oblivious to the corporate stranglehold and subtle ways they can be destroyed in the new business environment, or explaining that these programs would be fine if they weren’t done by government but the private sector instead.

                *And* the children were disciplined, and not pumped full of fake food, so they could actually sit for nearly 1 full hour and learn something.
Followed by at least another full hour of being outside, running around, and creating social interactions and more cohesion that led to them running said water treatment plant.

                    I have also heard that, in the times of one-room schools, the older students would, when instruction was being given at a lower level, help those younger students with that material. There is no better way, in my experience, to firm up your knowledge of some subject matter than to be taskedto teach itto neophytes. The essence of acquisition of knowledge is served by this, rather than being treated as a passive recipient of a deluge of soon-to-be forgotten factoids.

            They never ask/answer, “How much funding?”; “How is success measured?”; “When do we see such result?”
I have never undertaken a private contractural purchase or arrangement that has not answered these questions, nor did the the contractor expect not to answer these questions—contracts are often pre-typed “forms” with blanks left to fill in such information as it is expected *before* down payment.
I used to have a saying when there was hesitancy at my university in answering the “…how is success measured…” question, “If you can’t measure it, it doesn’t exist.”  It usually made for shorter discussion of the issue.

        With no one in power interested in the wellbeing of the system…—Just like “power comes from the wall socket” and “food comes from the grocery store” the political system comes from the buildings it occupies.  They keep assaulting the back-end supports for everything and yet they show up every day and there’s still power coming out of the socket, food at the store, and government in the buildings…at least until there isn’t.(A meta-issue of course is that all these clowns had to be as semi-functional and their descendants would be able to grift far into the future, but, they cannot help themselves).

            Reminds me of the female Ceo of GM demonstrating and talking about their electric car and more importantly the advantages of electric. Someone  asked where does the power come from? Meaning it doesn’t miraculously power itself without the grid and all the repercussions to the environment.
She said it comes from the building behind her. That’s where they charged it.

        Politics is a massive racket run by conmen, grifters and sociopaths who care only about a quick buck.Maybe you mean adjuncts likeDavid Axelrod or Jim Messina.But even these electoral mercenaries aren’t temporary figures in politics. Success makes them, and perhaps their offspring, wealthy over the long haul.The actual officials that they engineer into office establish dynasties with influence over many years. The degenerate Kennedys are a great example, as are the Gores, Longs, Adams, Bushes and now the dumpy Chelsea and the soon-to-be incredibly influential and electable Obama progeny. The quick political buck can exist for generations.

When I say it more or less works, I mean our problems run along deeper than the voting system. We still have a terrible ruling class

            Our problems also run deeper than the voting system. I cannot possibly see a benefit to ranked choice voting in any form of government.  The idea that the in a democracy with virtually no restrictions on the franchise and a totally ignorant populace that  you would want voters trying to spend the time to rank candidates is insanity.

The idea is so ridiculous as to cause a brain cramp in even the most pro-vote normie.(And don’t let them give you that “who is Jennifer Rubin?” bit, she’s one of the premier columnists for one of the two big regime mouth pieces.)

            Paper ballots, filled out in person with ID (and purple finger ink while we’re in fantasy land) fixes all the corruption.  Which is why it will never happen.
Japan rejected electronic voting machines a few years back.  They have auditable paper ballots with results in under a day.
It’s so incredibly obvious that the US voting system is designed from floor to ceiling to be corrupted it’s a wonder any thinking person ever votes.

        Nonsense.Blame the market for grift, corruption and cheatery? You may as well blame white gun owners for black crime.Criminals thrive in a society that tolerates them. We are seeing increased criminality because guys exactly like you and I tolerate it. We sit on the sidelines and maybe gripe about it on the internet. Not to fed-poast… but things will not change until there is a downside to engaging in this behavior. Joe, Hilary, Romney, Kerry – every single rat bastard one of them would not do the things they do if there were a good chance of winding up dead or in jail.No, the market is not to blame, nor is the system. It’s the guys running it, and the refusal to enforce laws that are already on the books that prohibit this kind of conduct.

            Glen:  Do you honestly believe that the former US constitution, if followed to the letter, would not result in something very similar to today’s Clownworld a few centuries later?  Sure, if citizenship and voting was limited to free White men of property, we wouldn’t be a third world abattoir, but unregulated capitalism – even amongst solely White men – would still lead to a search for ever greater centralization and monopoly and global profits.

                Merchants have no country. The mere spot they stand on does not constitute so strong an attachment as that from which they draw their gains.Thomas JeffersonIf we end up (I’m sure I won’t live to see it) with a 2nd American Republic or other American-only polity, we need to put great restrictions on property ownership to circumvent the rise of another oligarchy. Corporations should have an employee cap and have primary operations limited to one state only.I recall reading years ago that Russian Federation senior officials are not allowed to own any foreign property. Having skin in someone else’s success automatically means you have a conflict of interest that makes you a security risk. I doubt we have had an American senior official of any kind in my lifetime who didn’t own property abroad in one form or another.

                Hmmmmm.I am not a constitutional scholar, 3G. If you look at the third world, their countries have bills of rights, declarations, and constitutions as flowery and pretty as their American counterparts, with soaring rhetoric… and their peoples live in squalor.I believe the American constitution framed and enacted by men and women that revered God, and shared faith and values that – when combined with a good work ethic, allowed them to prosper beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. Americans agree on those values and shared the responsibility of safe-guarding them. Your nation was founded by men that wanted free and fair markets, run in a Godly way. They believed that everyone had a right to make a living.When America turned its back on God…things started going to hell fast. Our problems today don’t stem from markets. They come from greed, sloth, lust and all the other sins. Without rock solid faith, power and money corrupts.There is a lot to think about here.

            It’s an impossible situation since power only attracts wicked people.  No matter how you set up the system, it eventually is full of sociopaths squeezing all the gold out of the peasants.
DR folks push Monarchism out of the assumption that if the king is a random dice roll you might get a non-psycho.  Problem is it doesn’t take much time reading European history to notice just how many Richard IIIs there were.

        Haven’t read The American Spectator in awhile.  I didn’t realize they were publishing paid for content like National Review.  Their comments section, which I assume is regular readers were not interested in what this shill is selling.
One of the many opportunities Trump missed was not attacking the third world vote counting in California.  Especially after the 2018 midterms when they were still counting votes after Thanksgiving, this should have been low hanging fruit for his administration.

            I haven’t read the article, but it needs to be asked what issues does the current system have and will RCV help address those issues.  I seriously doubt anyone pushing RCV is honest about the issues in the current system which renders any “fixes” it’s supposed to deploy meaningless.  As your example points out, it appears it actually only serves to make a bad situation worse.

            RCV is peddled as a way to give 3rd party candidates a chance.  You’re not “wasting your vote” by voting green, or libertarian, or communist, or whatever…because when they don’t win, your “second choice” (i.e., the D or the R) gets the vote.
Alaska really proved how sneaky this is :  More Republicans actually voted, but the Democrat won the seat.
RCV:  Good on paper, not so good in real life.  Democracy in America as a dating app.  How appropriate.

            Eric Adams likely would have won in a regular vote as well. He was the guy that the supremely corrupt NYC machine system was pushing for years, despite the fact that he is a easily distracted and corruptible dim bulb who is more interested in using his status to attend fancy clubs than governing. Wait, not “despite”, “because.”
NYC is a one party city with absolutely no accountability and all that entails.

        I’ve said before, but I think it has already collapsed, at least for all intents and purposes.   I have not travelled outside of the country in some time, but my sense would be if I were suddenly on the Uris de looking man I would see the country in its true state.And part of this is that we are becoming a prison, and even the general aesthetic has prison overtones, namely where else are there tons of dykes in charge and the only woman a man could ever hope for is a man in a dress?   I mean they’re taking prison life and imposing it on all of us, and under the guise of equality and inclusion?.  I guess they think that sounds better.  But the way the people were all encouraged to get tatted up like prisoners should have been an early warning.

            Yeah and I think as the collapse becomes  more apparent our ‘leaders’ will become more authoritarian to usher in the slave state they’re so excited about.  And their war to destroy Russia has spectacularly blackfired. if Putin succeeds with BRICS it’s going to take them off the top of the hill and isolate them.  Yeesh. This is gonna get worse and be bad for while. Oh well.  Where’s the challenge in a peaceful death?

                What the morons in control fail to realize is that there can be no innovation in a slave state.
That said, they will push for nuclear war as soon as they internalize the reality the GAE is so de-industrialized it has no hope of winning a conventional war against Russia or China.
I believe the weird nuclear attack PSAs eminating from NYC were the first signs of this realization.

                    Trump saw the situation vis a vis Russia/China pretty clearly. The US standard of living is entirely dependent on Chinese industry and the regime there is about as far ideologically from what our nation is supposed to be as possible. The CCP also clearly has military ambitions towards Taiwan. It also would have made sense to get cozy with Russia if only to keep her mineral and oil riches from China. Trump’s efforts to bring industry back to the US may have been halfhearted and ineffective but at least they were something.Now we’ve got Brandon’s Buffoons  (think Hogan’s Heroes but EVERYONE is Col. Klink). They want a war of some kind so their options are:1) Rent the Chinese industrial base from China to use in a war against… China.2) Rent the Chinese industrial base from China to use in a war against Russia, an ally of China.In other words even they can’t be this stupid as to plan a war where victory requires the enemy to shoot himself for you. The saber rattling towards Russia (and still occasionally China) is thus theater for the urban wokist rabble and the remaining “loyal Murricans” who still haven’t heard about the fall of the USSR.The question is whether they are really desperate enough to blow everything up rather than watch helplessly as Russia and China divvy up the world. The psychology of our rulers is that of unstable women even though (not all) of them are female. Anyone familiar with insane women knows that they will often precipitate the most outlandish crisis to get attention.This is why I still think there is a chance for a “Pinochet moment” where some military man or men just puts their iron boot down and sends the tanks into DC, NYC, SF and other hives of villainy. I know there are actually a few of these types around and I know how it galls them to play along with the sham of taking orders from degenerates. BTW, I’m not suggesting that Trump is the guy for this job or even that it would be particularly good for us. If they manage to stop Armageddon though, they’ve at least given us a chance fight another day.

                        “In other words even they can’t be this stupid as to plan a war where victory requires the enemy to shoot himself for you.”Maybe it’s delusion rather than stupidity, but, yes, they really believe this. The European leaders who are funding the war against Russia simply could not believe Putin would turn the gas off spigot in response.It doesn’t compute and doesn’t register with them that such a thing could actually go against the narrative they firmly believe. The same with North American NPC’s. I actually replied, “do you think?” when one at a Labor Day party suggested Putin was hurting the Western economies.At the outset of this self-inflicted disaster, I flirted with the idea that somehow, some way, China and Western Clouds were orchestrating the war to collapse its West’s economies and hurt Russia. Silly me. The psychopaths actually thought China would side with them because they are such good people.The deranged lunatics running this clusterfuck are perfectly capable of igniting a nuclear war to keep feeling better about themselves. This at one point could have happened in the USSR with Andropov, but there were real men with actual intelligence who would not get onboard with burning it all down. We don’t have those types. The broken people around us and who lead us will burn it all down. I don’t see a military or civilian figure who will stop it.

                That is a curious irony that is lost on the lefties in my life. They love seeing the foreigners and the foreign restaurants in their suburban towns. For a lefty, if you can’t be rich, then at least be well-travelled. Lefties love travelling and “expanding their minds” which is why they love having foreigners and diversity within their midst: they don’t have to travel to eat that street falaffel they gushed about in Berlin. So now they can gush about that modest Arab street food they found 15 minutes away.I might bring up the fact that that food exists because Arabs exist and have lived in Arabia for centuries. That quaint Irish pub food they love exists for the same reason. Of course, the falaffel or colcannon would not have ever existed had those host countries allowed unfettered immmigration and willful replacement.

                    Marko:  From what I’ve read, one can dine on just about any type of cuisine in Japan . . . all prepared by Japanese.  Rather than importing Tunisians or Moroccans, they send Japanese chefs overseas to lean how to cook various national foods, and then said chefs return home.I may not be a native of ‘x’ but with the aid of common sense, basic cooking skills, local cook books, and imported ingredients, any White can cook any sort of food.  It’s hardly rocket science.You don’t have to import the locals for that.And as far as being well traveled goes, I guarantee I’ve lived in and visited far more countries than your average Mestizo or sub-Saharan immigrant, not to mention your average suburbanite.  People make all sorts of assumptions based on my background and are then shocked to find I’m a rayciss fascist.

                        I know even when I traveled in Europe, for the most part, restaurants were staffed with natives speaking the local language. My guess is that it would still be true, as we know that the “refugees” Europe has brought in the past 5-7 years are all working as doctors, lawyers, and rocket scientists, not lowly cooks.
Also, in the US, it must be said, step in any restaurant, any cuisine, and there’s a pretty high chance the cooks are speaking Spanish. Nobody has ever explained to me why Juan can make a bowl of pho but John cannot.

                        You can get better French food in Japan than in France — especially if you’re after classic Gastronomie Larousse fare and not deconstructed nouvelle wankery.
Where they fall down a bit is other Asian cuisines which they tend to make rather bland — spiciness and anything ‘smelly’ (one Japanese girlfriend couldn’t tolerate the mint and herbs aroma from a bowl of Pho FFS) flips them out.
