        Is Clinton Cash really surprising? AIPAC uses American aid money to israel to bribe the Congress, Senate, the Military Industrial Complex and anyone in Washignton.

        At this point in the republic’s collapse, it’s almost a sure bet to presume that anyone who is or aspires to be a member of the elite political class is a sociopath.  There are and will be exceptions of course, but there are not enough of them to matter.  The fact that the Clintons have thrived these many decades is itself a clear signal to other sociopaths that the pickins’ are indeed good in old DC, just as the scent of a rotting carcass attracts hyenas.

        It used to amaze me how some people just can’t see what a complete Bullshirt Artist Bill Clinton is. Yes, he *does* enjoy it. Same thing with Obama. There’s another guy that’s just ten pounds of horse puckey in a 5-pound bag. It’s just so OBVIOUS, to anybody who knows what a con man looks like.Before BO’s first election, I was discussing him with one of the smartest, most successful men in the country. A one-percenter. A hard-working, serious guy. A capitalist. I explained to him that Barack Obama is the new Music Man. Remember the movie? And yet somehow, this man was so blinkered, he  came right back and made the remark that BO would probably be a better president than any of the Republican candidates. I was speechless. What can you say to somebody who can’t see the elephant in the room?I guess my friend just comes from a better strata of society where you don’t see grifters and snake-oil salesmen often enough to spot them on sight. Probably he never bought a used car either.

        I do not find the Clintoons exceptional in any way save for their ability to be slimy and survive.  What is most interesting is the democratic voters.  They are willfully ignorant of the issues but good at sloganeering.  The cast of malodorous characters they elect to Congress and the Presidency bespeaks not so much of their moral vapidness but of their complete ignorance about issues and individuals.  See Hank Johnson,  oh heck the whole Congressional Black Caucus, the vile Harry Reid,  the evil Chuck Schumer, the clueless Nancy Pelosi, Barny Frank,  Keith Ellison, etc.  And they are proud of their choices. Heaven help us.
