        You wrote the other day that the doctrines of Christianity guided Christians through life in a fallen world.  The Snowflakes also inhabit a fallen world, but their world fell not because of man’s innate sinfulness, but because of the stain of ever-shifting “injustices” which must be put to right, or else.  Just substitute Rousseau for St. Paul, and you get the idea.  The inherent problem, of course, is that Christianity has a clearer understanding of the human condition than Rousseau and the Snowflakes: injustice cannot be eradicated with right-think.  But rather than come to that realization, the Snowflakes are more apt to see the frustration of their utopia as the result of those engaged in wrong-think, and the subsequent need to eradicate them.  Such was the reasoning of the first Rousseauist movement, which we call the French Revolution.  And we all know how that turned out.

        “Do unto others as you would if you wanted to heal the pain of injustice.”And there, my fellow travellers, we have the greatest twisting of all. Not ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you’ because that would be too simple, too transparent. Much too, well, sensible. You have instead to talk about ‘injustice’ and its attendant pain, because the pain is in you. Your feelings, your perception, because it is an act of selfishness. No matter too that the greatest injustices of the past two hundred years have been fashioned by communists, honed by left-adoring dictators, practiced daily by socialist cant and hypocrisy and supported by the fools in the overfed media who of all people should see what is going on but choose to avert their gaze.Language has been hijacked to help too, replacing clarity with emotion, replacing accuracy with vagueness, insisting that what you see is not what is happening so the reality you express must be judged by trends and fashions but above all being compressed and squeezed to cover a thousand issues with a few simple words and phrases that will never bring understanding.

        Reminds me of thisSalon quoteon conservatives/AmRen:
“Modern science now undermines all of their basic premises, and there is no reason to tolerate their hateful, dangerous, ancient, and outdated assertions.”
While the left is of course scientific, logical, loving, modern &amp; forward looking!They should bring that thinking full circle and make “be better” their 2016 slogan.

        “Fortunately the little princess who wrote that letter and her coevals lack the stones to do it, but that will not always be so.”
And on that black day, when the dust from the Pajama Boy Horde appears on the horizon, all will cry out in fear and anguish to a god that seems to have forsaken them.

            And the part of the Pajama Boy Horde that doesn’t trip over its own footies, as it runs down the hill, will start a slap fight with the princesses, with squealing all around.
That’s the point at which the animated Monty Python foot falls out of the sky, squishing everything.
Seriously, I just cannot keep up any more.  Did our elders think that we were imbeciles, too?

        Neo-gnostics, perhaps?  “Being-in-the-world” hurts?  What’s next?  They doubtless will recreate the demiurge as the bad guy creator with a small c who blindly made this vale of pain.My worry z-man is not that they will turn to coercion, but rather that they are the worldly expression of the suicidal impulse that seems to have seized our world.  They are the word made flesh.  My second worry is that rather than just offing themselves, having decided that the world isn’t worthy of their pure compassionate hearts, they will try to take us all with them.This is a suicide cult.  These are the people who watch those animated “the world after man” specials with their collapsing skyscrapers and bursting dams and feel a spark of pure joy instead of profound disgust.

        But where does that leave us who don’t give a hoot about others’ vulnerabilities, hurts of “structural injustice”, triggers, micro-aggressions, safe spaces, world views and so on.  What a bunch of wimps and whiners.  Jees I can’t stand this group.  What will they ever do when a hard rain’s gonna fall?
