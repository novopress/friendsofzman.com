        South Asians are some of the most destructive immigrants we could possibly allow into the United States.  While not as violent and stupid as your average sub-Saharan African, they are on the whole not as intelligent as Europeans.  They are also extremely ethnocentric people.  Some of them are just competent enough to secure well paying mid and high level jobs, but their extreme ethnocentrism means that once one Indian gets power in an organization, soon the entire department or organization is full of Indians brought over from India.  Furthermore, the primary mode of doing business in India (I know this first hand, as I’ve been there) is to try to scam whoever you can to the most extreme degree possible.  This mentality has carried over to the United States, which means you can never trust them when doing any kind of business with them.  They also, on the whole, have contempt for the native population.  They’ve taken over many of the gas stations, convenience stores, and hotels where I live in southern Appalachia which has only further eroded the social capital in what is already an impoverished place.  I used to enjoy traveling, but one of the reasons why I don’t enjoy it so much anymore is because every place I go is run by Indians now.  If I interact with Americans at all, it’s poor people employed by these parasites.  I’m to the point where if I know a place is owned by South Asians, I go out of my way not to patronize it.

            Good luck trying to explain this to empathetic white people especially in the midwest, who think that all brown immigrants are “just like us” and “want to work hard to make a better life just like our great-grandparents from Scotland”.
I see entire extended families from India wandering around rural farm towns in Michigan, Indiana and Southern Illinois because one family member took an IT job from Timmy at the local courthouse.
Even this Indian guy is open about how awful they arehttps://www.unz.com/article/india-its-worse-than-you-think/

This is also an intergenerational discussion. Plenty of millennials and younger, particularly from urban areas, have encountered Indians. The oldest generation truly is indifferent to anything but the cheapest price and their virtue signal.

                To be fair, most average Americans have no idea how things work in a place like India. One of the things that most shocked me when I went there was that most of the Indians I interacted with were nothing at all like the few intelligent and well behaved Indians I knew or had known back in the United States. India does indeed have a lot of smart people, but they are far, far outnumbered by the rest of the population which explains why India is the way that it is. Also, India is a very low trust society, which means that every transaction is viewed by both parties as an opportunity to scam the other person. Indians are so adversarial that they won’t even queue in a line when buying a train ticket or boarding a bus; everything turns into a free for all, and if you lose too bad for you. Unless you’ve experienced a society like this first hand, it’s hard to understand how different it is from Euro-American norms. We’re not used to going about our daily lives thinking this way, which makes those good midwestern people easy marks for these people.

                    “One of the things that most shocked me when I went there was that most of the Indians I interacted with were nothing at all like the few intelligent and well behaved Indians I knew or had known back in the United States.”I had a discussion of this phenomena more than once with someone online. Yes, many of the people here are from the Brahmin caste. As the top of the heap, they are clean, educated, and know how to conform to the social norms around them.Back home the government (for real) has run campaigns to get people to use toilets.The US is the boil off landing place of the people who would most fit in, for better or worse at first. Once they start to drag along their poorer and lower caste cousins, it’s New Deli in Toronto.

                        “Once they start to drag along their poorer and lower caste cousins, it’s New Deli in Toronto.”That’s the problem, isn’t it.  These top of the heap get in and are fairly successful, but never can escape clannishness.  Thus they sponsor their “extended” family members who warp the social fabric of the neighborhood.Case in point, father in law many years back had the experience in his (formally) White, middle class, nice neighborhood of having an *Apu* move in across the street.  First thing Apu did was cut down all the trees on the property and quit watering the lawn.  Then, a few months later, the now barren ground became literally a parking lot as he moved in another dozen or so “relatives”.The effect was a reduction in the neighborhood cohesiveness as Apu and company never interacted with their neighbors, nor considered the aspect of their home fitting in to the community standards or that it had became an eyesore.  Typical Indian mentality.  I suspect the inside of the home was up to snuff wrt Indian standards, but outside the home was a no man’s land.I’ve heard these stories many times wrt to the Middle East and South East Asians.  But this was witnessed first hand.  Fortunately, my Father in Law did not live very long thereafter so his suffering was short.  He deserved better as he was of original American stock who build this country over many generations.

                            Indians are Indo-European (Indo=India) and Aryan by definition. Their language is at the very base of the linguistic tree from which English itself is derived (Sanskrit, along with Latin are considered a canonical Indo-European languages).This is all to say that “Apu” or “Pajeet” are not typical Aryan names (unless you are a Judeo-Muslim Simpsons writer of course).Some common Indo-European/Hindu names are: Anje/Anju, Arjen, Arjun, Kiran, Minna, Hannu, Indra, Rishi, Muni (Munich is from same word), Viki, Mina, Ila, Viran, Angla, Uschi, Usha, Hema etc.A good way to guess North Indian names is tostart with something uniquely European (i.e., notfrom the bible), such as Cieran or Arjen. Those namesare exactly the same names that are common in India (Kiran and Arjen being two main gods in the Hindu epic Mahabharata).

                        There are maybe 100+ aryan tribes and 100+ dravidian tribes and these divisions make them the least ethnocentric people in the world.

                    And this is one of the captious things about selective immigration. In the case of India–or Nigeria, or Lebanon, etc.–AINO skims off the extreme cognitive elite of the target nation. India’s very best and brightest wind up in AINO and your average white, after associating with such people, makes the understandable if logically false assumption that these elites are representative of Indians in general, when in fact, they are extreme exceptions to the rule. This misinformation then justifies, in the mind of the deluded, the importation of more Indians. And before you know it you’re living in little Hyderabad with all its attendant miseries.As an aside, this process also constitutes a brain drain from places such as India, ensuring that such “developing countries” will in fact never develop. It is a lose/lose for everybody but the Muskrats.

                            Igbo are often referred to as the jews of Africa. They’re scammers and grifters par excellence. Unfortunately, they benefit from an angle that Indians don’t. Nigeria is predominantly Christian, and the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches have otherwise intelligent people who are enamored with their Nigerian co-religionists. The “based” African bishops who thumb their nose at the pontiff are usually Nigerian. I’m a steadfast Christian and I find this deification of black men speaking sanity to insane churches tiresome. It’s the same old conservative game where they find a brown person saying things they wish they could say and they enshrine this person because it makes them feel good via the copious amount of John Dewey skinner-box indoctrination they’ve suffered.

                            Let’s be fair to your friend.  He’s been propagandized since the age of 2 that all groups are equal.  He’s also been propagandized to believe anyone who thinks otherwise is not just wrong, but evil.  Even if had bothered accessing true information, it is just so much easier to believe the propaganda.

Tars, that was all just as true of me. But here I am. Thus my limited patience with the colorblind civnats.

                        Unfortunately, many white people are so browbeaten with the racism indoctrination that, upon meeting the first group of brown people that don’t regularly rob convenience stores, they’ll declare them a “model minority” and begin advocating on their behalf.It sounds insane to us and other people who are capable of using two oldfangled concepts known as “logic” and “reason.” If Indians are so brilliant, why is India a disaster? Because it’s full of Indians. Common sense dictates that if Indians were so capable and intelligent, they would have established a nation that is not so horrible that they’re all trying desperately to escape from it. America’s immigrational balance to Japan is negative, if you could believe it. Japanese Americans all want to go back to Nippon. And why shouldn’t they? It’s clean, orderly, and prosperous. That’s your benchmark for a foreign population that could contribute more to a society than it takes out. We don’t get many Japanese immigrants anymore. They want to stay in their country. I lend my full-throated endorsement of the sentiment.India, on the other hand, produces nothing of value. I suppose if one could measure GDP in sexual harassment and phone scams, they might be a global power. But in terms of producing anything anybody wants, India is a net negative. Even Indian food isn’t Indian. Butter chicken? Chicken Tikka Masala? British people invented these dishes. To paraphrase the immortal words of Rowan Atkinson in a sketch he performed: “We have the recipe. We can send them back.”

                            India is a disaster for the same reason Italy is a disaster except India was holocausted (100 million dead) by 500 years of Islam and then 300 years of British (and you did not want to be on the receiving end of the insane cruely of those British back then).You think of 2 million dead in Ireland, what do you think they did halfway across the world ?The East-India company was the richest company on the planet for a reason. They left utter desolation.Slowly, India comes back – very slowly. But it’ll get there. It was 40% of the world economy before the British showed up and was &lt;1% after they left.

                                India is a disaster for the same reason Italy is a disaster except India was holocaustedThere is an even more insidious reason why India progressed so slowly even after 75 years of independence from the British.At the peak of the British Raj, there were only 50,000 or so British ruling over a population of several hundred million.In a brilliant move, the Brits fashioned the Indian Civil Service, the Indian Revenue Service and the Indian Police Service to use Indians to rule over, loot and discipline other Indians at the behest of their imperial masters.Post Independence, the Indians were left with an administrative blob/deep state that continued to administer, loot and discipline Indians while keeping the loot for itself.It is only recently that the political class has been able to wrest control from the entrenched bureaucrats and reduce the corruption somewhat at the central level.

                        Back when U.S. immigration policy was sane(r), it’s my understanding that if, say, an Indian obtained a degree at a U.S. university, he had to return to his home nation for at least five years before he could be eligible to work in the U.S.  I may well be wrong on this, and even if true, there might be ways to game the system (aren’t there always?). But the intent of the policy would have been to encourage the alien to use his newfound knowledge to improve his own nation, at least for a time.

                            I’ve long thought I could support something like that. In essence, non-whites should be allowed to attend college here provided they earn admittance rather than having it given to them via DIE set-asides. However, once they complete their studies–and there would be strict limitations on how long they could study–they must leave the country immediately.

                        India is one of the main reasons that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has a carve out for “customary” bribes…In fairness to India, that was due to the Arab “Emirs” whose relatives skimmed a percentage off every defense deal made.Defense deals are and were big business for the western countries after the Arab oil embargo in 1973.  Look up the modus operandi of Adnan Khashoggi, the arms dealer of the Saudis.At that time, India was being supplied arms by the Soviets as India was a client state.There were very few American arms deals or multinationals in India at the time as Pakistan was America’s client state.

                    I know many young, high-IQ white men in the midwest who have zero interest in college and 9-5 cubicle careers. The really smart ones have hustled into multiple trade schools in their 20s (welding, electric, aircraft maintenance etc) without taking on debt and are rapidly mastering ‘nomadic work’ scenarios. I don’t know any white man under 30 that wants the boomer lifestyle of house, 2 cars, kids and suburbia.
The brown hordes will all have degrees from once-great Amerikan colleges but will be earning $10/hr like in the 3rd world. The race to the bottom is inevitable.

                “Even this Indian guy is open about how awful they arehttps://www.unz.com/article/india-its-worse-than-you-think/“
I rarely second these diversions, but the article is quite good and written by an Indian who decries his fellow countrymen immigrants.  Discussion centering on just how long adaptation to Western standards of behavior and thinking can take—or for that matter, if they can take.  It’s much, much more than a negative screed.  There are some important psychological aspects of a people pointed out.

                    This “article” is the exact opposite of quite good.
You do realize this whole article is written by a Judeo-Muslim or Pakistani ? Maybe if I call myself “Mickey”, that makes me a mouse too, eh ?
The Judeo-Muslims cannot fight the Aryans culture, history and symbology (there are only about a million swastikas in like every Hindu temple, book, ceremony, wedding, decoration, home etc), so they go with this sort of thing.
Almost entirely context free too.

            To what extent does Vance’s wife compromise him?
JD’s defenders say: “I know a good one” or “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”
My instincts are to reject non-whites and their white relations because their loyalty to their tribe will eventually dominate, but our numbers are few and we need help. Desperate times call for desperate measures.

            The real problem is that after 5 decades of immigration finkery, no one trusts our government to just import “critical workers.”  Suddenly, everyone is “critical.”“We must import 1 billion Pajeets to be engineers or we’ll lose the race!”Ok, let’s import a bunch of Chinese then.“We can’t import Chinese, they’re a bunch of race conscious future traitors who’ll steal everything and send it home! And their degrees are all fake!”Uh, you just painted a billion people with race consciousness which somehow is correct for China but incorrect for India.Plus somehow Chinese engineers are “fake” but India engineers are “real.” How, exactly, are they going to “win the race” with fake engineers?It’s so tedious. It’s replacement labor either way. No one clamoring for Western European labor.If I’m going to be replaced, I’d prefer it by Mexicans, Chinese, then Indian, in that order.India is disgusting.

This isn’t true if you’re outnumbered by them, and white women who were dumb enough to take “Eat Pray Love” tours of India have found out the hard way. Conservatives can’t get enough of Indians. “Brown people who don’t rob liquor stores? Fantastic! Give us more!”The sneering condescension from them is enough to make me hate them. I don’t fathom how they can maintain an aura of superiority when their garbage-dump of a country has a problem stopping people from defecating on the streets. They’re a nation of liars, schemers, and scammers. The gypsies of Europe are ethnically Indian, and we didn’t learn our lesson from tolerating rat-eating dalit trash, apparently. The Nigerians aren’t much better, but they at least bathe once a month and attempt to speak English clearly and without a pronounced accent.Unfortunately for the world, Indians insist on creating more Indians. This is somewhat surprising given the utter contempt that all women have for Indian men. It should surprise nobody that everybody’s favorite group of rootless cosmopolitans established massive NGOs in India and, during COVID, encouraged all of the men to seek their fortunes in the US, Canada, New Zealand, Autralia, and Europe. That’s why the amount of mannerless public-defecators has expanded in the West recently. Thankfully, not all is lost. Canadian leftists have begun to hate Indians and regularly flock to reddit to complain about them. Hopefully conservatives won’t take the bait by engaging in knee-jerk oppositional politics and deciding that we need another dozen million feet fetishists on our nations to “own the libtards.”https://identitydixie.com/2024/06/09/the-indian-question/

                Your hope about ‘conservatives’ is -quite simply – baseless.  Even here, people are convinced we can use the Indians as temporary allies, or turn them to suit our purposes.  Meanwhile, they gush about the Indian’s post at Unz – which I read a few days ago on Amren (where I am banned, and Jared Taylor delights in publishing posts by supposed ‘based’ non-Whites with whom he thinks we will somehow produce a White revival).Jayant Bhandari may claim to recognize what ails India, but he will always be an Indian.  He may wear a western suit and sport English university credentials, but he is still a product of his culture – and countless generations of Indian ancestors.  Has he renounced his extended family?  Changed his name?  Do his children regularly visit extended family back in India?  Does he practice Hinduism?Even with concerns about what immigrants do to what’s left of AINO, I see an equal concern about a ‘brain drain,’ as though if the supposed ‘cream’ of pajeets go home, they can somehow change their homelands.  Almost no one says “the Hell with Nigeria/India/Guatemala, all I care about is the wellbeing and fate of White people.”And while many here – including myself – didn’t vote, there is an equal number who retain faith in electoral politics and the ‘democratic’ system.  They are certain it will all be fixed once they elect the ‘right’ people, and with Trump’s victory they are certain redemption is here.I may be black-pilled, but people are fools, and will get the future they deserve.

                    You’re completely correct on the Unz column. When I read the article and he mentioned having cousins and extended family that engaged in the chicanery he was lamenting, I had the thought of “yes, and you’re an apple from the same orchard.”

                        I’ll take 3g’s comment a step further: the Unz column itself is sort of a grift. The Pajeet is marketing himself as Not One of Those, and a person who is a valuable asset able to provide insider information about his kith and kin. It is so typically Indian.eta: I should have read your piece prior to my comment above. The rape angle is huge. Muslims–yes, Muslims–regard Hindus as the rapiest of the rapiest. The Indian government from time to time will go through the motions of an anti-rape campaign, but it is just for show. Rape is perceived as a right by them. They are the most sociopathic race in every respect.

                            Rape rate in India is the lowest in the world – same as Japan. India has 1.5 billion people and a few thousand rapes in the entire country per year (if that). And half of those minimal numbers are aborigines and muslims anyway.Shoot, that’s a week in the UK or Australia.You can read any official UN or govt or even CIA stats on this. So, why would the Muslims call Buddhists/Hindus “rapiest” ? Dunno, maybe Muslims need a laugh from being the religion of peace and doing: 9/11, KSM, Osama, chopping off infidels heads, UK grooming gangs, blowing up the London tube, genociding countless civilians in India, NYC Times square bomb…

            Heck, why shouldn’t they have contempt for the native population? In the rest of their economic empire they rule over guys in grass skirts, lounging under coconut palms, drinking kava, while they, the Indians, basically run these island and third-world places. Here in the states, the grass-skirted equivalent are beer-drinking white guys fixated on worshiping large, overpaid Negroes  chasing a ball around on TV. Unless and until Joe Sixpack throughout the western world boycotts spectator sports, plus other targets to protest his political and economic disenfranchisement, nothing will change, not even electing Trump!

            This is exact opposite of reality – both Aryans and Dravidians are the most law abiding, peaceful, cultured and assimilated immigrants of them all.
Data from the Department of Justice (DOJ): of the 662,566 illegal immigrants, a total of 435,719 on the docket are documented to have criminal convictions in their home countries; that is 65 percent. Another 226,847 or 34 percent, have pending criminal charges. There are close to zero Indians with any criminal convictions, all the infinite terror is solely Judeo-Muslim, South American gangs and Africans.

            They already know that they we won’t die for their right to sit on their bag of money. That’s why nobody is serious about WWIII. The collective Great War of the 20th century took a reasonably healthy populace ready to die for nationalism. They had to have some social order and sense of social duties. Both wars were less about passion/warrior or even Roman armies and more about factory workers dying in a factory manner, for a sense of home mostly felt by their grandfathers.Zero of those conditions exist modernly. The elites have the society they wanted, with no responsibilities on them. It also means no war machines either. It also means making Washington, DC a prison for elites when they get scared about the mass riots of their imaginations.That said, I’m guessing most live in fantasies about us little people having obligations to them. I tend to think events like that recent shooting of a health insurance exec tend to erode even those flights of imagination. It’s not so much the shooting as it is the complete lack of public outrage.

        Where is the great need for smart tech workers in our country? I see Musk and his network of useless bullshit companies might need a slew of them for what, a useless enterprise for conquering the galaxy or overpriced and non essential electric powered cars.If the problem is as Musk says a lack of competent and uneducated American workers then shouldn’t that be the existential problem we all need to address and fix? Bringing in South Asian undesirables who are here mainly because they work cheaper and draconian employment restrictions on White counterparts are the real issue.It’s not about what America needs but what Musk, Bezos and Google wants. We have the people right here. Educated, smart and willing but are suppressed and banished to the phanthom zone because they are the wrong ethnicity. Many have moved on years ago into other areas and even self employment after seeing the writing on the wall.Even Scott Adams experienced this probably 30 years ago and quit his tech job.

            For many of these jobs it’s simply impossible for a White kid to get his foot in the door, largely because right now Indians are doing the hiring and Saturday people are advising them on how to do it without technically running afoul of the law. Just after Election Day someone spotted an ad that Tesla ran in the classified section of the Austin newspaper, in 0.005 size font. This is what they do. Nobody looks there, nobody sees it, nobody American wants the job so they need to bring in 500 Indians to do the work.White people can do any and all of these jobs, and yes this goes up to the CEO level.

            The Leftists who’ve controlled America’s education system the last 60 years annihilated all standards of achievement in an effort to make the Hutus feel like our intellectual peers. In consequence, white students are not challenged and they do not learn. That’s why relatively few are prepared to do high-level tech work. Restore those old standards–and devil take the negroes–and voila! You’ve got an extremely competent workforce once more.

This.
In the one example I’m familiar with, White guys were hired and were grossly inadequate to the task.  I appreciate one’s loyalty to the race, but it’s not that simple (IMO).  As I’ve noted before, DIE is not simply pernicious because it promotes the graduation of incompetent minorities, but worse, it lessons the standards for *all* graduates in technical fields—and that includes Whites.

            Musk and the other tech bros seem to have ignored the fact that one of Trump’s main constituencies is White tech bros. There has always been a strong conservative and even ethnocentric tendency among White tech workers. For most of these guys, the Indians are a major threat to their livelihoods and they are well aware of the way one Indian in a department turns magically into a department full of them. Alienating these people for the sake of being able to hire cheap Pajeet tech workers is idiotically short sighted. For one thing, once the dollar collapses and/or the tech bubble bursts the Indians will go home to India. We native born White tech bros will still be here, and will be filled with rage at the Muskrats who sold them out.

        Great post today.  Up until recently my pajeet detector was basically non-existent – no reason for it.  Now it’s pinging all the time. I look around lately wondering where the hell did all these F-ers come from, why are they here and how did they worm their way into so many positions of power and influence?  For example that pentagon spokes bimbo. Those who’ve aided and abetted this alien invasion need to pay a heavy price, which we can only hope comes to fruition.

        Watching the twitter storm last night was hysterical. “America must WIN!” What is this, the Ford Administration?
The best point was that H1-bs are a form of slave labor. The migrants must retain their corporate sponsorship in order to stay, so they put up with working conditions no real American would tolerate.
The new oligarchs apparently have no less contempt for the American people than the old. Trump should take notice. He might be amazed at how quickly his support can disappear.

        Z Man: “American is not a corporation. It is a people.”
Also Z Man: Tocqueville observed “there has never been an enduring sense of American identity, other than” making money.
Can both statements be true?
Northern Europeans tried to inspire other races to look beyond race and embrace meritocracy, but no other group followed.
White Americans have an identity that was forced on them because the other groups insist on seeing them as the group to be overthrown.
You may not be interested in race, but race is interested in you.

            I think both can be true. Often it is the money making identity that dominates, but there are periods when it was subordinated to other things, like the long fight against communism. The racial awareness we are seeing with whites in America is in response to the economic excesses. The revolt against immigration is a polite way of expressing racial solidarity.

                But the inability of whites to just come out and say, “I don’t want them here because they’re not my people, they’re not white” makes their arguments so much less powerful.
Because whites can’t use race as a reason, they’re forced to play by the other’s sides rules and morality. White have to make economic arguments, which can be countered. Or whites use the culture argument, but the other side can just respond that America assimilated all kinds of people over the centuries.

            In a formerly racially homogenous nation the idea of ‘racial identity’ is superfluous. Only when foreigners invade does the issue of racial identity become relevant. The invaders naturally identify as ‘others’ while the hosts play catch-up on the concepts of racial differences. Ultimately multiculturalism results in the racial politics seen in prisons (i.e. enforced segregation by races).

            Whites, especially Northern Europeans are the least ethnocentric and the most high-trust race.  Most White Americans grew up in extremely non-diverse communities until the consequences of Hart-Celler ’65 appeared. Race wasn’t even thought about in everyday life unless you turned the TV on.
As LineInTheSand says, race is forcing itself on Whites. The Whites who can adapt will understand that it’s back to nature.  “Eat or be eaten.”

        This was a great essay. We should face the historical facts though. Post-industrial America has always been exploitative. Andrew Carnegie came from Scotland as a boy (sorta like Musk from SA) and had no qualms with exploiting immigrant Slavs in steel mills. Yeah he left a university and a music hall, but the oligarchs of old weren’t very different from today’s. The bankers lent too much money to Europe and got us into WWI. So they sent Sgt York from the farm. I don’t want to go full Howard Zinm, but we should keep things in perspective. It’s possible that our postwar relative prosperity was the historical aberration.

            Your old versus new oligarchs comparison forgets race. Every town in America had a Carnegie library where poor, white boys could learn and improve their lives. Of course, the steel baron got rich from their fathers’ labor, but they and their sons could also benefit from his largess. Today’s billionaires reserve their charity for infinite browns, with the aim of fanning racial tensions and supporting pressure-releasing riots.

                    Because it’s the people, not the the buildings. I’m sure there are a few Carnegie libraries still extant in what are now black or immigrant neighborhoods which serve no purpose other than vandalism. It just depends. Modern oligarchs prefer to waste their charity on low-IQs.

                Fair enough. Libraries aside, my point is that Oligarchs have been exploiting immigrant labor in this country since the Potato Famine. It’s an American tradition. (You could argue it goes back to colonial indentured servants and African slaves too). The Oligarchs will stop importing immigrants when it suits them or when Whites rebel.

                    Exploitation, perhaps. But those white immigrants, ca. 1880-1925, came to America with their eyes wide open, knowing that times would be tough for a while, but also knowing they would be better off here than in the Old Country, and understanding they had more opportunity to live life to the full. The concept of exploitation is mitigated when exploitation is an improvement.

                        Yes, thank you for the nuance. Except for the more egregious cases (e.g. chattel slavery or any intentional deception or coercion by employer) it should be clear that in most cases of employment offers no deception existed. Some outside observer may well call it “exploitation”, but if the contract was entered into in good faith on both parties’ part, then who was harmed? One of Jesus’s parables even teaches this (Matthew 20). The owner of a vineyard underestimates his labor need. Thus he hires more workers as the day progresses. He promises each of them the same wage (a denarius, was worth a day’s labor, about $50 in today’s money). When it came time to be paid, not surprisingly the workers who’d worked the longest were pissed. Yet the employer replied, quite rightly, that he’d deceived no one; each worker received the wage he agreed to.

                    Yes, white indentured servants had an unfortunate habit of escaping to the frontier. Neighboring settlers might have their suspicions but largely sympathized. Now a negro pitches up at your cabin and it’s another matter. Contemporary elites love infinite East Indians precisely because of their Indian-ness. Diversity has always been intheirinterest, not ours.

            Yes, I would agree with these observations. Rome had many colonies by the end of the empire. The most commercial of enterprises were in North Africa, when she colonized over another purely economic settlement in Carthage. What’s left of the Roman culture all lives on the Northern half of the Mediterranean sea. (Do not get me started on St. Augustine was a black man because we was born in Africa frustrations.)I think the US will have something of it’s English heritage around. There’s so much land, I  could easily see us becoming the nation states of Europe again. I suspect the natural inclination of Europeans being willing to deal with bad weather means the farther north you go, the more European it will get.That said, whatever shakes out eventually will have to think about more than money.

        Having worked for Pat Buchanan in the 1990s, and suffered the career consequences of being associated with the horribly anti-Semitic and isolationist and Natzee “America First” label for decades, I’ve watched with amusement as the term became normalized and then skinsuited over the past decade.
Now it reaches its final form, as an Indian immigrant sitting in front of a laptop wearing a red baseball cap. Fantastic finish. I really have to give the folks who do this for a living a few slow claps.

        I’ve worked as a programmer since I was 21 fresh out of college. I remember when the Indian craze started in the early 2000s. Before that, I worked at a very big tech company on a suite of products that had about 400 employees working on them. Almost 99% at the time were White. Most males, but probably about 10% women. What came out of it was some damned good software. Then the craze started, and it all went to shit.Fast forward 27 years and I’m here at my current job. Our company, like all others, desperately tries to fill die-versity quotas. It has proven to be impossible. So far, in the past 6 months, we’ve been through 5 Android developers. All of which were either Indian or some other brown mixture type (mostly hispanic). We had one black guy who failed to produce anything and was fired within 3 months. The most recent was an Android architect whose resume looked like he’d had experience with every technology under the sun. He was fired as well after only 2 months with zero code produced.What you see happening here is reality colliding with fantasy and the usual suspects refusing to accept reality. It is a frustrating cycle. We had one pajeet retard on our team who would literally ping team members and ask, “please provide some inputs on how to do this”. It completely escapes him that his job is to figure it out. It is amazing what has happened to tech, and I have been doing it long enough to see the collapse happen from the early stages.Outside of the corporate mess these vermin cause, they also ruin neighborhoods. My hood has become infested with them. They put mulch over top of weeds, never cut their grass and have shit all over their yards. They have no idea how to use power tools or properly maintain their homes.I hate what this “country” has become…

            Along the same lines, I’ve noticed that researching a new language or framework has become harder and harder. Most of what you find seems to have been written by Indians in their odd dialect and is also quite poorly written and organized. I tried to switch to relying on videos but of course then you just have to listen to some Indian gibbering away in Pajeet pidgin.

        The White guys who built Silicon Valley had no loyalty to their own people, they might have built HP and Apple and Intel and Microsoft (I know they’re not akshully in Silicon Valley) and Atari and all that but they were the first ones to sell out to foreign labor, outsourcing, and globalization all helped them increase profits.i once read that Silicon Valley is like 70% foreign at this point. That might be an exaggeration or misstated but it’s reasonable for an American to wonder why Americans benefit from it being there and not in Bangalore. Like what do we get out of it? It’s the question never asked because line goes up is supposed to be enough justification.imagine what Silicon Valley could be if it hired Americans. I was never that impressed by the Indians when I was in college, and I saw them cheat all the time. When I saw IT departments get outsourced and taken over by Indians on the job I never saw a stunning  increase in efficiency and productivity – actually the opposite. In school the Whites and East Asians were far more impressive and hard working. But they are not as clannish and not as conniving and those are the traits that the current crop in charge reward.

            The short answer is that Silicon Valley (or any domestic industry) would be quickly out of business if it had to hire only Americans. Rather, to make my case stronger: if one insists that all the labor and manufacturing is domestic, it puts that corporation at a significant disadvantage to foreign competition. On second thought, let me amend that “quickly” to “slowly” which, as it turns out, is a much more accurate depiction of the decline of not only American but indeed much of the West’s industry since WW II.Even if there had been the odd Capitalist who had deliberately tried to retain his U.S. workforce and facilities, despite his best intentions, with time, he would have faced increased foreign competition. If he persisted, he would effectively be subsidizing a less efficient workforce. Given such negative alternatives, the Capitalist makes a rational choice to offshore production, even though it’s (likely) a net loss to the home team.The reasons for that are complex, but a major one was that entire industries could be “exported” to places with cheaper labor and few to none of those silly safety and environmental regulations. Of course there are (“were”) measures that could have been taken to discourage such offshoring. Various exchange controls or punitive tariffs, etc. but it should be noted that these incur collateral costs of their own.Note that I’m not saying any of the above is “good”, but Iamsaying that those are fundamental economic and political truths, that won’t go away just because we don’t like them.

                The problem with all that is that these countries that will supposedly put ours out of business are almost certainly not fillingtheircountries with foreigners to produce what they do. So how do they remain competitive? Well, of course, these are countries with all around lower wages so the real issue is wage arbitrage. The only real solution to that is some kind of governmental intervention. Of course there are costs to that such as higher prices for the consumer but the social cost of just giving in and accepting a globalized wage marketplace is, among many other horrors, that there’s no incentive for anyone in a high wage country to learn anything difficult or challenging since they will certainly end up unemployed and broke.The other problem that is somewhat unique to the US is that a country whose currency is in demand all over the world as a reserve currency will be unable to produce export goods that can compete abroad at least on price. The only real solution to that is to create some kind of reserve currency that is notalsoa domestic currency in your country. I think the Chinese dual currency system may be an attempt to deal with this problem as well as helping the CCP retain control of what the Chinese can buy with their pay.

        Cheap labor is the Holy Grail of Capitalism. Musk 𝘦𝘵 𝘢𝘭 can no more resist its allure than the wino can resist his bottle of muscatel. Tariffs and nationalism held the cheap labor monster at bay but the demise of one and the weakening of the other has turned it loose with a vengeance. The old pro-labor party gave up on American labor to import a new class of voters and get a new class of supporters: the rich. The pro-business party now serves a different sort of business: trans-national corporations.

        Because the plotters are nerds, the error in the Trump skinsuit op is social, a failure to “read the room” as the Twitter girls all say. When you become Trump, we are freed to hateyou—to the point of literal assassination.I heard that Elon and his friends received many, many wishes for deliveries from Luigi’s Restaurant yesterday. A Christmas miracle! The incoming administration’s police-state crackdown on “antisemitism” won’t makeallof that go away.Of course Musk and Vance and Viveket al.live behind a wall of cops—they’re libertarians!—so comeuppance won’t find them, but instead whatever “bro” (nerd) is available.The eye of Thiel is everywhere, so every manful response to the self-defense situation Elon has invoked will be punished.

        “It is tempting to call this feudalism, mostly because feudalism has an odor about it, but the feudal elite actually had a bond with the peasants. The feudal order started with the reciprocal relationships between the elites, but it also included vertical relations that bound the top to the bottom. The king had a duty to his people. In this age, the oligarch has no duty to his employees. They are mere economic units to be exploited in order to fulfil his obligations to his fellow shareholders.”Amen and thank you for this. Feudalism had it’s flaws. However our over the top reaction to it modernly is about being in a worse social situation than a European peasant. A peasant was not a slave, even though we can’t wrap our heads around any of those conditions. We are too busy living the life of corporate slavery without any of the social obligations of the elite to the rest of us to realize we’re in a worse position in many ways.

        While Twitter and social media as a whole are not indicative of real life, the immediate and ferocious backlash against Sacks, Musk, and Co. is white pilling as hell. Younger people, particularly, have had enough. The fact this was floated before inauguration is the only surprise here outside of that intense response.

        The king had a duty to his people.
Yeah… but why did King Sigismund allow Gypsies in Europe? Now that I think about it, the way gypsies flooded Europe is very reminiscent of the current invasion from the third world. Including the betrayal by elites. How long has this disconnect between the people and their rulers been going on?

                Their numbers were not enough to replace the existing populations, partly because their culture and lifestyle set their Malthusian limits lower than the native populations. However, their numbers were large enough to be a nuisance to distract the peasants.

        There have been many good posts on twitter on the immigration fracas, but for an eye opener, read the replies and comments. There are really a lot of young, very ticked off, white guys out there. They’ve done everything right, and get lied to and sent on their way. Trump got a lot of young people’s votes, and that’s the reason.

        You gotta admire the mental gymnastics [intellectual dishonesty] involved with David Sacks’ attempt to justify Sriram Krishnan’s appointment as “America First.”  Regrettably, this is only one of so many more examples.  In fact all of politics, at present all of it, has reached this foul depth.I wish David Sacks would have at least rationalized Sriram Krishnan’s appointment as “Globohomo First” (and thus a positive thing, of course).  While this would be every bit as harmful and would stink every bit as much, at least then David Sacks would be honest and forthright about who and what he represents, and who and what he actually is.

            An easy way for him to justify it would to say there is a need for contrary voices or say that this guy may not be onboard with many things, but he is onboard with this one thing.
It is incredible to me that these tech bros are so tone deaf on this issue. They could have ignored the whole thing and saved themselves the trouble, but I suspect they thought MAGA was onboard with Infinity Hindus. Great example of how insulated these people are from the rest of us.

                They did do some “battlespace prep,” the seemingly inexplicable (until the Christmas attack) invention of the “woke right” description of any non-leftist who recognizes systemic anti-whiteness. It seemed like an insular tantrum among the manufactured e-celebs of “the right flank of the left,” didn’t it? Today, Elon joined that rhetorical campaign against us.If Trump adopts “woke right,” the assassination plot (alternate ending) was a success.

        A side issue at least with many tech jobs: If the job could have been outsourced to a usually cheaper foreign location, it would have been. Thirty years ago, in my mid 30s when I was at university (Computer Science BS program) if I was in a sarcastic mood I would sometimes tell younger students that India and similar nations were filled with English-speaking Computer Scientists (BS or better) that worked for 10% of what the average salary in the US was. If that was broadly true (I think so) it’s probably gotten only truer in the decades since. And if true, it well explains why these Subcontinentals are elated for the chance to work under a H1B visa, even if they don’t gain permanent residency and have the chance to import their entire village clan.

        Looks like um,um,um,um,um,um Yarvin, um,um,um,um,um, got his desire. He claims a CEO is a monarch and that we need the CEO to fix the company.Given that immigration is the key issue it is hard to see now. Kash Patel will reform the FBI. Srinam Krishnan will work with David Sacks to open the floodgates to Indian programmers. I remember my first day in India. The headline news in the Bangalore rag was that three quarters of the legislature had not shown up once to Parliament. That was in November. I remember going to the Brahmin neighborhood. The houses were decent. The dirt roads didn’t have potholes, they had craters three times the size of the car.Where am I headed with this. America is being liquidated. Yay! Robot bartenders? I guess Sri and Vikesh will be filling the bars getting served drinks by the bots they programmed? What an amazing future for America. And of course this was all planned with Andreeson and Musk and these guys.Btw, I didn’t know tech companies were hiring in large numbers, so why the push to green card the incoming hoardes?As for the low end of all of this, Victor Davis Hanson just made the case for keeping 20 million of the illegals around and giving them a path to citizenship. (https://amgreatness.com/2024/12/23/fixing-the-biden-border/)America First is bleeding out in back parking lot and Sacks, Andreeson, Musk and the banksters are wiping their knives on their ill-fitted and wrinkled t-shirts and jeans.

            P.S. We also have confirmation that Vivek running around and embracing septigenarian MAGAs in the Midwest was nothing more than what it was most likely to be. He was running around talking up America First and calling himself in on the We as We Americans. It was all BS.
The real Vivek had campaign signs in non RW&amp;B and just said, “Vivek”, on them. The real Vivek was the guy who posted him and his son at the Collosseum in Rome and said it was, “a part of our history.”
This thing is finished.

        The split during the mid Cold War was between a more Russian-friendly GOP and more China-leaning Democrats.  Thus Pepsi went to Moscow and Coca-Cola went to Peking.During this time supposedly non-aligned India (read non-Marxist but anti-colonial, i.e. anti-Western) was seeking advantage between the two.US policy was generally pro-Pakistan, more so under Republicans. Yet GOP outreach to India kicked into high gear under W.  At the time this was seen as a counterbalance to both Islam and China, but I wonder.I do not know much about either party’s approach with regard to either foreign or immigration policy during period between 1989 and 2001.

        “…not a lot different thanhow the mafia operated Las Vegasor the Teamsters Union back in the 1970’s.”
Lol, forgivable dumb statement becausr Z wasn’t around then. Las Vegas was always about exploitation and profit, never pretended to be otherwise. The mob never had delusions about it, either. Also, generally accepted the place ran better for it, too. Kids.

        This debacle isn’t on the elites, it is entirely on the shoulders of Trump and his supporters including the majority of the readers of this blog.Trump stabbed white people in the back for 4 yearsTrump told you explicitly that he wanted to vastly expand legal immigration including H1BNow you fools are butthurt that the “betrayal” that was telegraphed long in advance is happening.Looks like its now time for all the “dissident” influencers to act like rebel leaders again after grifting off of Trump during the campaign.You get what you deserve, and quite frankly I don’t think you people are smart enough to make it.

                Worse, its a fake dissident blog.  I respect Brietbart more for the honesty and lack of pretensions.
I watched how this place changed during the 2024 election, The majority of posters went from trashing Trump during 2017-2021 to actively cheering on his campaign in 2024.
No matter what you say during his 2nd term, I have no doubt the same fools will fall for some future kayfabe theater in the future.

                    As someone who has been consistently hostile towards Trump, I can’t express how nice it’s been to be proven correct in my assertions, especially before he’s even been inaugurated.

                    Very much so. At best, Trump is the (slightly) lesser of two evils. He still answers to many of the same powerful forces. Anyone who expects a Savior should get off at the next stop. If we get a few more conservative judicial appointments and no Cabinet positions staffed by a man in a dress we’lll have accomplished a lot.

        Nothing changes until the environment changes. And time is running out on the Ponzi scheme, so they need to act fast with CBDC because once free money ends and real hardship returns, the plebs are going to go berserk. Collapse, chaos, and fog begets a flourishing of Luigis armed with cheap DYI drones equipped with hunter-seeker AI. That is the only form of accountability with a chance to motivate real change. And it only takes a few hits to start the stampede. Now is the time to substitute planning for pissing &amp; moaning.

        To be honest, who knows if it will work or not. Gut feeling is no but this is a radically different way to organize people than has ever been attempted in a nation state.
What will we do if it actually works, or doesn’t instantly collapse?
my greatest fear is this ends up somehow working better than the sort of mutated half method we have currently. Justifying its continued existence.
is it really that far off than what moldbug wanted with his “corporate state?” If we could just make a handful of the tech billionaires race realists….

            Most times for an adult to learn something he needs to unlearn something else. This process never ends if one loves unpleasant truths more than himself, and never begins without it.People in general are repelled by it. Some throw out terms like “nonsense” without stopping to think that far better minds than their own have explained in detail why they believe. And no, I am not a Christian.
