        This is one of those times I agree completely with Andrew Anglin that everything about this “election” is fake, gay, and meaningless.Taking the 2024 Election Seriously Makes You Look Stupid and Delusional, by Andrew Anglin – The Unz ReviewBecause, even putting aside questions of vote manipulation, I do not think it makes any difference whatsoever which one “wins.” Even if Trump meant everything he says, which I don’t believe he does, it has been a long time since there was a president who was actually in charge of anything.  Which won’t change absent armed conflict. And he doesn’t even pretend to talk about the wall anymore. Even if he “wins,” his presidency would be no more successful than it was the first time around. If that. The most significant accomplishment, as it was in his first term, would be arousing the “left” to greater insanity. As if we don’t already have enough of that. Otherwise, maybe he would give us some more Kavanaughs and Barretts. Be still my heart.Against this backdrop, praising or critiquing anybody’s “campaign” style is purely for entertainment purposes, kind of like the campaigns themselves.

                When has the electoral environment of the USA not been a confederacy of scoundrels? Back in the early daze of the USA, when the Constitution was being debated in the States for ratification, Rhode Island held a referendum of authorized voters on the topic. The legislature, I think it was, just ignored the spurious text of Article VII, which calls for conventions. The leaders and rulers of RI held their referendum in 1788, but fewer than 10% of the voters supported the Constitution of no authority. Guess what happened during the next few years.Somehow the Rhode Islanders were compelled to accept the convention fraud, but a slew of conventions failed to deliver the result demanded by the gangsters, some of whom were merchants and whatnot (and their relatives, I suppose) in Newport and Providence. In May 1790 the empire of liars threatened a trade embargo when the Senate passed a bill which would have banned trade with RI. Later that same month the Rhode Islanders caved in to the browbeating, threats, and intimidation. The desired appearance of consent had been manufactured.

                    Yes, it pains me to say it, but the adoption of the Constitution could be an early example of manufactured consent.  Ouch.  The Constitutional Convention‘s initial mandate was limited to amending the Articles of Confederation and they produced a new document instead.On the other hand, most people on this site agree that some people are smarter and wiser than others and those people ought to be making the decisions, like a parent not letting a child subsist on sweets.History says that some elite will always rule over the rest, so the crucial issue becomes the character and preferences of that elite.  It seems that the best we can hope for is an elite that has affection for the governed.

                        The solution is rigid ethnocentrism by race and religion (with variation within these by ethnicity and denomination handled with federalism -&gt;local homogeneity and local self rule) coupled with a deliberate and explicit removal of any kind of merchant from the control nodes of power.The 3 countries most demonized by the GAE and its ofttimes rebellious appendage the EU, are Russia, China, and Iran. The countries have very different economic, social, and political governance structures. However, the one HUGE thing they have in common is that in none of them do merchants rule. While each of them takes a different approach, in all of them POWER (as opposed to the mere exercise of administrative authority at the behest of those with power) is embedded in governance structures from which merchants are excluded.Russia and China have national security states and Iran has a ruling layer of theocrats who have power to remove anyone undesirable from getting access (running for office) to authority in their institutions of republican authority. Russia has a formal law allowing nationalization of oligarch assets to keep their miscreants in line. It seems China uses long prison sentences and the occasional execution.Lest the Iranian system sound undemocratic and unseemly, consider that while they have mullahs disqualifying candidates for exercise of federal authority, they do so out in the open and everyone knows the rules. We have, here in the GAE, Jewish and collaborator hedge fund rats executing the exact same function, except behind closed doors. Their system is far more ‘democratic’ than ours.Even rule by one’s own merchants is untenable. That is the story of early to middle America. Rule by alien merchants, the story of late America, is a civilizational genocidal death sentence.

                            More is the pity for those Merchants because they often start off in a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with the host but with time evolve to being parasites at first one that the host can tolerate but eventually a parasite that weakens and kills host and parasite alike.

                        Rhodesia was such an example of eugenic government.Only landholders could vote, and their immigration policy was to strictly vet applicants.  They had a meritocratic system that encouraged and reinforced only the literal best of and for their people.

                They are like celebrities, only 1000 times worse.  I hold them in the absolute lowest esteem.  They would sell their children to Satan for coin.  At least regular celebrities get good money for their children’s souls.  The average “influencer” would sell their child’s immortal soul to Satan for likes and 50 bucks.

        Eventually, the Harris character will have to step outside the curated world of gameplay and talk to flesh and blood humans, as well as debate Trump.
Here’s the thing Z, she doesn’t. The media is her voice now, even moreso than it was for Biden in 2020. We have a candidate that doesn’t have to do anything or say anything. If she says nothing, there is nothing to criticize. Say what you will about Nick Fuentes, he is responding to things that Trump has actually said on the campaign trail.

                Fuentes is trying a “Groyper War 2” while not understanding that why “Groyper War 1” was so powerful is because it took internet discourse to the real world, and utterly humiliated their targets in a real venue. Their targets could not escape physical space. You won’t get the same effect in a purely online space, too easy to ignore and tune them out.

                    It is important to note that Fuentes played a peripheral role in that real world activism. His role was to comment upon it online. It was pat Casey organizing the the things in the meat space.

                    “Groyper War” is so cringe. Only a suburban pipsqueak who hasn’t even broken a rib would call it a “war”. And thousands of media pipsqueaks before him used “war” too…”war on Christmas”, “war on women”, etc.
Excuse my boomerism, but “you don’t know what a war is”.

                Thank you for “trump says a lot of things and they should all be taken with a grain of salt,”.Listening to the Talk last night, there were a few things that were a bit hard to swallow.  ‘A grain of salt’ makes it a lot easier to handle.

                Yes, the things that Trump said in the 2016 election campaign should have been taken with a grain of salt, because he accomplished none of them.I despise Fuentes. I will not let someone label me a “Groyper” or whatever moronic Zoomer term is in the atmosphere today. He’s probably a fed. But it doesn’t matter if he’s saying it or someone else. It’s still true.Every time Trump or one of his minions starts talking about how he “built a wall” and “cut down immigration” I walk away, because I’m sick of being lied to by all of them.Fuentes, whatever he is, at least has the merit of pointing to Trump’s words versus his actions and calling attention to the variance. Sure, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe Trump wins in 2024 and on 1/19/29 writes out a pardon for Nick Fuentes. If that happens, I’ll accept any corrections. But chances are, it’ll be another list of rap artists and Jewish criminals, which “the Right” will tell us to accept in order to get “da black vote” and support our “greatest ally,” and the same symphony I’ve been listening to since 1980 will continue on.But the notes are growing dimmer and dimmer, the record groove more worn, and the crackles are louder by the year. How much longer are we going to play this game of Personalities?

                While I know Trump runs his mouth, we need to think this through. I know there is a lot of questions about what a Trump 2nd term will be. Some people (like Pete Quinones) say that he is being pushed by the PayPal Mafia to smash the DEI managerial bureaucracy. The JD Vance pick is the clearest evidence of this. Some people (like Nick Fuentes) say that he has turned into another Republican loser like Mitt Romney and John McCain and his second term will be as ineffectual as his first. He dug up “drill baby drill” for heaven’s sake. He talks about “immigration aS lOnG aS iT’s LeGaL”. It’s bad.I don’t know. I tend to fall on Nick’s side of this, to be honest. Thing is, for Trump to have a 2nd term, he needs to win the election, and, I don’t see how campaigning like Mitt Romney and John McCain will do it. Even if there was a third option – Trump is just larping and is going to be totally based when he wins – he’s not going to get there without winning. He would get more votes by just campaigning as totally based.

                    Smashing DEI, though welcomed, would be low-hanging culture war fruit. Probably will happen regardless, DEI is so onerous. Overturning Roe was much bolder. Methinks there are other, more important, interests being pushed.
I could be wrong. Maybe DEI is the finger in the dam, who knows, but it smacks of bait to me. Poor Bigs. There’s much more at stake, then again, people will rally around the simple issues simply because they feel free to talk about them.

                        Roe V. Wade was a freak accident waiting to happen. If it were not for the sudden wave of disappearances of liberal justices of the Supreme Court, it could have held up indefinitely. The politics of the nation, mired in a split country culturally, make it likely that this isn’t the last we’ve heard of Roe V. Wade. It WILL raise its ugly head again.— G.N. (www.dark.sport.blog)

            You’re quite right. If Kamaltoe refused to debate and actually campaign in meatspace, who would say boo to her? She would absorb a few slings and arrows from ghetto-dwellers such as us, but that would be more than compensated by not suffering the public humilation stemming from the revelation of her galloping stupidity.

                    I think many Leftist atheists praised Dick Dawkins for refusing to debate that “Nazi,” William Lane Craig. You see, Dick prevented WLC from basking in Dick’s aura and drawing legitimacy therefrom, which was a most righteous act.
Kamaltoe could easily do something similar, claiming it would be irresponsible of her to degrade the dignity of Our Democracy by appearing on stage with, like, literally Hitler. The media, the generic Left, and some centrists would eat that up.

                        I’m not familiar with the debate you mentioned. In passing I would note there are some right wing atheists among the readership here. In recent news what you might have missed Richard Dawkins was just Unperson on Facebook for the thought crime of saying that men can’t be women.

                Kamala should debate. She would win. Why? She can speak and articulate. She’ll simply obfuscate or ignore the question at hand, but such a performance will keep her supporters in line. It is enough for them that their candidate is not a walking corpse. The average voter won’t have the perception of incompetence as we here do. Another’s incompetency can only be judged if you are competent yourself!

                    Trump’s best shot at winning the presidency is to engage the Democratic candidate woman in debate and prove his masculinity. A masculine candidate “trumps” a feminine one any day of the week. The gender of the candidate, which is one of those immutable factors, determines how (s)he is perceived — another variant of the political rule that you vote for someone you’d like to have a beer with. People don’t drink for Kamala.— G.N. (www.dark.sport.blog)

            Kamala Harris is the “Raygun” breakdancer of the political world. Try to find an actual video of that “Olympic athlete” actually you know breakdancing. It’s all been scrubbed.
I did find one partial video of her moves. Hilarious.

        I’m impressed with Kamala’s campaign platform so far. It’s nothing. It’s not even pushing the “I’m the anti-Trump” line that Dementia Joe pushed in 2020 (which he failed at but won due to election fraud). Her campaign seems to literally be: “My handlers stole the 2020 election and we’re going to narrative fuck your mind and steal 2024 based on no platform at all, just an entirely media created bubble and spin, and there’s nothing you can do about it. I’ll do no interviews because my personality is extremely grating and hide except to the extent I’m provided media cover. Eat shit, goy.” It’s kind of shocking when you think about it, lol.In other words, Kamala is just a placeholder for the election stealers to provide plausible deniability as to the upcoming extreme election theft.  When seen in this light, everything else makes sense.(That’s not to say Blormf’s campaign is much better. He’s been coasting and displaying a lot of laziness and ineptitude, as usual.)PS:The vast majority of the money to “fortify” the election is coming from the hundreds of billions of Ukraine “aid”, which 95%+ of is merely laundered through Ukraine back into the hands of the transnational security elite.  The Orange Retard ultimately supported these bills with no knowledge of what was in it or what it was being used for.

                My only hope is that these people’s greed and love of luxury outweighs their political pieties. There may be a reason to believe so. After all, orchestrating a political campaign is complex and fraught with randomness. Going down to the docks and talking to the man with the Rolex about that nice super-yacht is much simpler. Let hope the Ukraine graft goes to buy that boat.

        “Eventually, the Harris character will have to step outside the curated world of gameplay and talk to flesh and blood humans”-Not necessarily. Biden didn’t really campaign in 2020 and he “won.” Remember those astroturfed “town hall” meetings for Hillary in which nobody showed up? She won the popular vote in 2016.Fake reality precedes the Internet. Whatever the networks choose to cover, or choose to ignore, or to crop out of the picture matters.Every Harris appearance will be carefully curated and focus-grouped and performed before an adoring crowd of left-wing feminists and trannies on a college campus. What will matter is the photoshoot, and if the polls show that the rigged photoshoots may not do the trick then they’ll get the ballot-stuffing machine oiled up.We are in the age of the fake puppet president, you cannot possible expect she will run a real campaign.That’s why Trump freaked them out so much he actually went to meet real people and got shot. He may be a bullshitter but when it comes to interacting with real Americans he is genuine.

            Biden did many interviews in 2020. The “campaign from the basement” meme was just that, a meme. Sure, he avoided tough questioners, but he existed in the meat space. Thus far, the Harris character exists only online.

            It will be interesting to see how far this can be taken. If Harris still comes up short, the absence from meat space will be adjusted downward to a minimum that works. This is the future, even if the hand is overplayed this time, and it is such an extreme example of totalitarianism it would make North Koreans blush.

        In the old days there was always a liberal Sam Donaldson that would even confront someone like Harris with questions about her inflation strategy or how do you respond to Trump’s charges of failure on illegal border crossings. Now they just don’t ask at all and actually just act as attack dogs for anything right of their masters.They are all in on this one just like the last. The holy card illustration for the Time cover (it still exists?) was not unexpected. The cool and sassy wine aunt from now until the election. My only hope it doesn’t even get that far and God willing the biggest shit show national convention happens and sinks the whole thing with a diaspora of woke idiots running to safe land. Just a wish.

            I’m afraid that you’re too optimistic.  The unprecedented power of the hegemonic media to dictate most people’s opinions is greater than anyone imagined.
I bet that the media can change most people’s perceptions of Kamala’s cackle from off-putting to endearing.  A top down message will go out that we all find Kamala’s laugh comforting and inspirational.  People in my family, for example, will believe this and repeat it within a week.
I’m starting to wonder if the media could literally convince most people that they actually love the smell of shit.  And it will become true.

                    More than any other response in this entire set of messages today, this article perfectly encapsulates why this media created character will sweep Orange Man away effortlessly. It is a simple numbers game at this point, I don’t even think they have to do much vote rigging. Let’s take some absurdly generic numbers.Non-white population- now almost 50%. Strong Black Queen Vote securedLiberal White women- another 20% or so? White Guilt I hate myself Vote securedLet’s even say they are only 15%, that is still a bigger number than 51% when combined.The population of this country is dumb as a f-cking rock and liberal white women are right there with the mud people in this category. “Low information voter” is a compliment. They all get their reality through a 6 inch screen so who cares if Kamala is a vidya character? Their lives and reality are fed to them through that screen so its as real as everything else they consoom. Articles like the one above are absolute catnip to Negresses and White Lib College Chicks and Wine Aunts.Not to mention they have the attention span of an acorn and the memory of a gnat. Everything in their life happens in real time and maybe yesterday is the extent of their historical memory.It is basically a one party system now. Plan accordingly. And even IF Trump wins, demographically, pretty sure this is the very last election a Republican could ever win as the great White die-off continues apace.

There have been interesting ‘proof of concept’ projects like this. A notable one was the 4chan prank to make people think the OK sign is racist. Heaps of high school kids ended up getting cancelled for the ‘made you look’ gag in photos.

        Comparing ONLINE to ON-TV, online is closer to reality.  One example is that cell phone cameras are a game-changer in revealing black violence, misbehavior and dysfunction.   TV’s longtime agenda of promoting the Huxtables, Sidney Poitier and Danny Glover as “just like us,” is in danger of crumbling now that real-life videos are going viral on social media.

            Exactly. The era of 3 stations or even cable TV made it easy to hide reality. Now there’s as many potential leaks in the narrative as cell phones. Open censorship is less than ideal.

        I honestly have to wonder about what’s best for our side.  Sure, a Trump win might slow some things down a bit, but I think it will do more harm than good.  A cheating win for the ridiculous, cackling whore boss and her beta fag may provide some of the acceleration needed to push this wreck off the cliff.

            He has become just another Republican. For policy purposes he might as well be President Mitch McConnell. Yet simultaneously, one who arouses the “left” to a level of insanity not seen in AINO in living memory. It’s possible they would have got there without him, and he’s just the convenient foil.

            Tired Citizen:  I’m inclined to agree.  Too many people have a ridiculous amount of hoperiding on a bloviating civnat NY developer, fervently believing that if they just vote hard enough, Trump will win and make it all right again.  It doesn’t matter if you mention the cheating, the tens of thousands of numerkin voters Biden has imported, Trump’s devotion to ‘black’ jobs and mestizo opportunities.  They are convinced the Trump will magically fix it all – the inflation, the immivasion, the decline and fall of the White race.And if/when he loses, there will be no uprising, no mass civil unrest.  There will be some online complaints and a general resignation – “Oh well, we’ll vote harder next time.”  If this wreck gets pushed off the cliff, it will be by the left going full bore, because they have no real opposition.  Like you, I wish we could just get this over with.  Not because I don’t think it will be terrible, but because the longer AINO hangs on, the fewer the number of Whites, and the smaller the White remnant with enough brains and brawn to give a damn about survival.

        With the caveat none of this matters at this point: just as a Ukrainian victory could not be memed into existence, it is doubtful a Harris presidency can be, either. Still, let’s say it happens absent massive cheating, imprisonment or assassination. Wouldn’t governance itself at that point transition into virtual reality? The protags in the game would be strong women of color, the antagonists evil straight white men, the governed NPC’s, and political decisions would be made by the programmers, all of which are somewhat the case now with high tech managerialism.Not that it wouldn’t have done the same if the technology had been available, but the old Soviet Union had infinitely more transparency and flesh and blood participation in government than that. As it stands, the United States and most of the West have become far more totalitarian than anything that came before. There seems to be some panicked recognition developing within slices of the economic elite that this cannot be confined to culture and will move into finance and markets soon enough. The digital age that was supposed to liberate has shackled modern political and cultural life and the “total” part cannot be limited to those aspects. “Selling the rope” did not end with the USSR but morphed into imposing a social credit system that was foolishly thought to be confined to the game characters.As law and politics become more online, those involved and who participate are likely to become an even narrower slice of the population, and the vast majority will become indifferent and alienated until the divorce between government, courts and the people is final and absolute. That situation can only survive so much reality.Kamala Harris is the perfect avatar of the zeitgeist.

        As a parent of three Zoomers, they don’t call it, “highly online”, they call it, “chronically online”. As in: “What happened to Jaylyn Kaylyn Braylyn?” “They lost their minds from being chronically online.” So, there is, I suspect, some sense of self awareness in a subset of Zoomers.

        &gt;. They have the ideas of the other players in the Nick Fuentes game space. It turns out that right-wing zoomers are just like the right-wing boomers they criticize. They just have a different god.About four days ago Trump made a swipe at Joe Rogan, which all the online right-wing space freaked out about and thought it would derail his campaign. It took up most discourse for the afternoon. Today, not a single post. Everyone has moved on. At least your boomer grandpa had the attention span to stay enraged at what the TV told him for longer than a couple days.Dead Internet in Social Media might not come because of bots and deepfakes, but by how tiresome the extremely online are.

        I’ll stick up for online culture for a moment. I prefer this method to drooling in front of a TV…with TV and radio, everything is passive consumption. With online-virtual, there’s some interaction. Sure it can very fake, but with all the hours of Richard Spencer I mean Nick Fuentes on video compared to, say, Tom Brokaw or even Jay Leno, what we see is probably what we get. Nick is ridiculous, but he’s probably verifiably ridiculous.What I don’t trust is yesterday people like Kamala, who were bred for TV-radio but wound up in the internet age to sell their soul. So they use the online-virtual like TV-radio: carefully managed, out of the spotlight as much as possible, and only the best “bits” get shown. So to us, who are now having to slog through a 3-hour livestream, Kamala looks even faker and gayer.The yesterday people trying to run an online-virtual campaign will be exposed, if not this election cycle, then the next. They’ll be like the last people who figured out that high-fiving was what the cool kids did and we’ll laugh at their attempts at it.

And yet I’m told break dancing is now an actual Olympic sport. (Recently, a statue of Poseidon doing the moon walk was unearthed on the island of Thassos.) Perhaps a species of 80s nostalgia is being bruited by Gen-Xers in the Power Structure.

With online-virtual, there’s some interaction.Seconded, the shift to internet-based reality is a good thing for us – politically, at least.The usual suspects have seventy years of experience in tellyworld, but the internet suddenly levelled the playing field more dramatically than the typeset press ever did. That’s why our numbers have skyrocketed the last twenty years, and if not for the ruthless crackdown on RW content, our guys would’ve owned Youtube and Twitter by now. The internet is where we are strongest, this is where we should fight.So the internet is 99% lame? Sure, but the last 1% is still a hundred times better than the boob tube.

        The virtual gameplan being used for Heels Up has been ongoing in the Ukraine War for over 2 years now. Ukraine is the plucky underdog victim of Putler that has won every internet battle ever fought. Of course that is bogus, but what is not is the nearly 1 million good men that have died in real life as a result of this fakery. Moral of this story . . . the root problem must eventually be solved in meat space. No one can eat a virtual steak when the grocery shelves have emptied.

Litanies of crime after crime ever since.The abject failure of their false moralities, their learned helplessness and the real loss of an America many remember, or many never got to know.Their Start Trek future turning into a Zimbabwe future.This, by their own bullying, hectoring hand.They cannot bear the burden of such guilt and sadness.TDS hysteria is them displacing their rage at themselves and the world they shoved down everybody’s throats. They don’t know why it’s going to sh*t, why their shows are so crappy and their jokes so lame, why everybody is unhappy with the fabulous future.It can’t be their own limp, noble selves. A scapegoat must be found.Biden was senile in 2020. But who would care if the old goat croaked?They missed Trump, this time. Biden was bumped off for that titanic failure.Kamala, the ne plus ultra of woke- and a dusky irrelevance who isn’trealcompetion to white women- has brought a desperate straw of joy and vindication.This orgiastic expiation is all timed to the election.

        OT, but we Americans should get on British timelines on twitter and faceberg and post the most “hateful” things we can get away with (avoiding Twitter/FB “jail”).  These asshats are actuallh threatening Americans with extradition!!!  As corrupt and evil as our system is, they will not extradite us.Perhaps a tsunami of American “hateful” comments will protect our British brethren from prosecution in the UK by overwhelming the system.   They are throwing people in prison for allegedly mean posts.  Of course, they refuse to actually solve any crime.  One guy just got a 10 month prison sentence for posting pictures of thugs with knives looking all “Asian” with a caption “coming soon to your area”

        “This is the first election where people are asked to choose reality versus escapism.”Is it?  Is Trump’s pandering wrt SSI being make tax exempt, or tip’s tax free, not a form of escapism?  Has it not been the same in past elections?  I’m not so sure.Every politician it seems wins or loses on how well they sell escapism over reality.  And after every election they do what they will and we are the worse off for it.None of this should be surprising to anyone who has had contact with young children—and that is about the intellectual and emotional level of the majority of the electorate.

                Exactly.  And another bit of evidence I may introduce to our assertion of “escapism” is to look at those political “wannabes” who specifically centered their campaign efforts around realism—debt, true immigration reform, etc.  Where are they today?

        The level of disconnect from reality observed in younger, and perhaps also older, “normal” people meets the old criteria for mild to moderate psychosis. That is one of the reasons they changed the criteria in the psychiatry manual about twenty years ago

Lol this was not very well thought out. The people who organized the Floyd riots do not care about the sanctity of your lawns. Nor do the people commanding the thugs currently kidnapping Ukrainian civilians to send to their deaths in the Russian meat grinder.
An angry mob they might care about.
An angry mob that is organized around a central list of demands they would take more seriously still.

        Eventually, the Harris character will have to step outside the curated world of gameplay and talk to flesh and blood humans…
Fingers crossed, honestly. But if this Online Game works, this will be the last time any of them have to engage in that practice.
Almost there, folks.Almostthere. Pretty dark right now. There’s not much Ellul or McLuhan said that hasn’t come to fruition. And that’s without mentioning the crazy Uncle in the attic, Ted.

        Let me add, it is do or die time for people like Elon Musk. If Kamala wins, he will be extradited to the UK to spend the rest of his life in prison. Same thing goes for players like Jamie Dimon, Bill Ackman, Ike Perlmutter, another finance big shot I can’t recall, the petroleum industry, the car industry (there is only room for a niche player for electric cars), the trucking industry, the military (woke screaming Alphabet+ brigades are not going to cut it with a reliance on draftees experiencing 50,000 casualties a month), and more. Other targets of retaliation: Zuck, Peter Thiel, a lot of other VCs, etc.Send Elon to jail, which will happen if Kamala wins, and the space launch capacity goes to basically zero as the whole point of Elon is a cut-out to evade the Woke DEI stuff that destroyed NASA and prevents Boeing, Blue Origin, or anyone else from launching much of anything. Space X launches more that 100X the tonnage of CHINA, that is a huge strategic advantage the Pentagon will not give up.Musk and Trump spent a lot of time talking about how making political lawfare the rule, means no one can lose elections and not go to jail. That it does not stop at just political figures but their backers down to donors / advisors and even just voters. They are fully aware of the results of a loss.Much of the shadow play is the Woke CIA / Soros, money is the weapon, vs. the kinetic Pentagon where weapons wielded by men are the weapon.

        “”This is the first election where people are asked to choose reality versus escapism.”In a sense, every election since Bush W. has been this choice, to the degree the media has become so monolithically pro Democrat;  Whenever a Republican is in the White House the screens and headlines are roiled with hostility and hate, which brings out the crazies onto the streets and into the workplace.So, normie votes for Obama or Biden to turn down the mayhem and rancor, which is all just manufactured, but amplified to eleven by the media.The choice is dealing with the reality of the world, which requires border control, limited spending, and the whole panalopy of old school conservative policy, while having to endure the screaming and antics of the vocal left, or pretend everything is fine while the border is overrun, trillions of debt piled up and trannies and degenerates run amok.Most normies just want some peace and quiet in their living rooms during dinner hour..  That is escapism.

            That’s what the BLM riots were mostly about, scare the normies into voting for sleepy Joe and Kamala (or at least not for Trump), or else it comes to your nice neighborhood. It worked and now one of the architects of it, Tim Walz, is on the ticket along with pay-their- bail keep-going Kamala. Message received.

        “More people get their news from online sources than from legacy sources, so if you win the internet then it suggests you can influence people.”Depends on which part of the internet you’re trying to win. Harris is not going to win the alt right internet area. She might win on Facebook and her ads on YouTube are on virtually every video I watch — but whether that will have much impact is something I doubt. At some oint one would think people would ask — or should ask — what is this conwoman offering, what’s her agenda, what’s her policy platform? What do I get by voting for her? Of course this only applies to the small number of swing voters and it matters only in the swing states.

            It’s still about the low-info voter, which has replaced the undecided voter. Getting that “viral” clip or catchphrase into the MSM is what draws the low-info voter towards the thing like a bug toward a light.
As the demographics get more vibrant, I expect we get more 60-year old politicians hooting like banshees and bumping and grinding for the low-info voter.

        I disagree with the overall assessment, as past experience with other things, specifically Girl Boss movies, has failed spectacularly, no matter how many fake influencers, reviews, shills, and media fawning occurred.The results for Ant Man and the Wasp: Commie-mania, the Marvels, Furiosa, Secret Invasion, Willow, the Acolyte, Borderlands (featuring Granny Bosses), Indiana Jones and the Adult Diaper of Destiny, all failed spectacularly. Box office flop after Neilsen flop.Meanwhile, bro-tastic Deadpool and Wolverine, has sold a ton of tickets, Fast Food places are running co-promotional ads (as opposed to dumping Girl Boss Marvel/Star Wars stuff).Sure, these movies sold “some” tickets, but say the Marvels? The people who made up most of the ticket buyers were White dudes age 35-44, desperate for a Marvel fix of any kind. Women simply never even showed up. Madame Web is the subject of epic mockery, despite being Girl Boss ^10. “He was with my mother. In the Amazon. Researching spiders. Right before. She. Died.”All the media hype, ads, reviews, etc. could not get people to buy tickets for the Girl Boss versions of Indiana Jones, or Marvel, or Star Wars shows like the gay-bodice ripper The Acolyte. [No, really].I do think the box wine toxic single childless catlady people will vote Kamala! like they did Hillary! … but everyone else is likely to be Trump Train. There is a reality check at the supermarket every week. At the Gas Pumps. For the Electric Bill. Women do NOT like Girl Bosses, their fantasy is the be the WIFE of the big boss. Not the pseudo male imitation of the boss. Black dudes really don’t like Girl Bosses, and neither do Latinos. Black guys are not voting Trump, but they won’t turn out for Kamala married to a Jewish man either. Latinos are moving Trump, based on economics. Since Kamala = more Biden.That X interview with Trump and Elon Musk did not just ‘happen’ — serious defense players know we are toast with any conflict with China over Taiwan or direct intervention in Ukraine / Russia. Trump is the buy time, reconsolidate, reform dude for serious players. Not saying they have the most power, or even a lot, but they have significant power.Bottom line: if the internet cannot sell tickets to the Marvels, how will do that with the tired old version of Kamala/Walz ?

            Thus, Trump is no longer a reformer, agent of chaos, or defender of anglo saxons (if he was ever really any of these things, agent of chaos maybe), but now just a tool of entrenched moneyed interests. Just another Republican. Yet one who inspires in the “left” a civil war level fervor.

        “Like a discarded scene from a video game, all of that is gone now. In its place is the new character whose only connection to the prior character is the name.”Interesting insight.  This touches upon one of my favorite pet peeves, (fictional) movies claiming to be “based” upon past historical occurrences.  Those movies most often have little to *nothing* to do with what we know about the history of the events depicted—except to use the famous names of the main characters in the historical narrative and possibly the general physical setting and time frame.Can’t tell you how many times I’ve listened to “young minds of mush” relate to me their “understanding” of history based upon these movie presentations/interpretations.  Quite sad, albeit darkly amusing—especially when I have grounding in the particular historical incident being related.

            They can’t even get fiction books to movie conversions right.  Most of the time when I watch a movie based on a book I’ve read, there is almost no connection to the book.  Every detail is wrong.  The last book to movie conversion I’ve seen was Disney’s abomination about John Carter.  From the first minute to the last, every single thing is wrong.  Given that they named it John Carter, they had 11 books to chose scenes from.The only exception to this I’ve ever seen is “The Road”  It is an almost verbatim conversion of the book.  In fact, it probably is verbatim.  But, The Road is a very unique book that made the conversion to movie pretty easy.  It’s almost all dialog. Very good book and movie. Highly recommended.When it comes to “based on a true story,” about the only detail that is ever right is the name of a person or perhaps the name of a place.

                Stop Ostei—now you got me back to thinking on that farce about Black women at NASA, “Hidden Figures”.  🙁
But to bring it home, I had such experience directly when son came home and told me about that wonderful civil rights figure, Rosa Parks.  At that time, the story taught in school was much more whitewashed than commonly told now.

        Up until very recently I assumed this election would be a repeat of last time but now I could see israel doing something crazy lile ordering the mossad to assassinate the mail in ballot mules to stop the rigging. A few months ago I would’ve considered that too outlandish but given israelis are publicly arguing that sodomizing random palestinians to death is morally sound I assume anything is on the table now. Here I thought israel couldn’t top the bad optics of bibi blowing up aid workers &amp; smiling when talking about it but apparently there’s no limit which is why I now think such a ridiculous scheme is possible.The foreign policy position towards israel will be nigh identical regardless of who wins but there’s no doubt that they’d prefer someone who doesn’t have to pretend like they care about arabs &amp; has no qualms about kicking off a regional conflict in the middle east so naturally trump is their preferred candidate.Pretty wild that it’s even a possibility that trump could win again after utterly decimating his under 65 year old White voter base during his last term. It’s ironic that pouring gasoline on those smoldering ruins via becoming the very thing that he ran against last time is quite possibly the very thing that’ll get him a second term.Personally I’m rooting for the diaspora jews if only because I’d rather not have another four years of seeing people who should know better running apologetics for many the same policies. Nobody other than trump with his cult of personality could get conservatives to argue that warrantless home searches to seize guns without due process isn’t a big deal. At this point trump could nominate baphomet as his VP &amp; you’d get accused of being a biden voter for questioning it. The sooner this man is removed from the public consciousness the better.

        I noted an article on zerohedge, which is usually better than this, titled “she is actually leading “.  It was for members only so I couldn’t read it, but come on.  Of course we’re going to be gaslit about such 24/7 for the next several months, so just have to grin and bear it.  So I guess Trump just keeps doing stuff like the Musk interview which supposedly had a billion views and drew the ire of the European Union and all other typical “right thinking” tards.  Spicy times over the next few months.

        The many liberal Boomers/Xers that I know, none of whom are excessively online are accepting Kamala with a warm embrace. They don’t care that she was selected not elected and would accept Bozo the Clown as long as he had a D after his name.
It is really quite something to watch this cult of personality be created out of thin air.

                Boomers are divided between conservatives and liberals. They are also not that divided, with Boomer liberals and conservatives getting along with each other better than with the rest of the generations.Gen X is all over the board and very disunified compared to the generation before it. There are many Gen X liberals and they will be far more dogmatic about it.

        If you’re unsure whether the virtual space can defeat the meat space, you need only look at Ukraine.  That entire war is a complete online virtual b.s. show 24/7.  The problem?  If you send a harsh tweet at Putin, Putin fires back bullets at the Ukranians.Bullets beat tough talk tweets every time.  And the Russians are winning in Ukraine despite all the ways they restrict their operations to limit Uke casualties.The puppeteers controlling Harris are going to try very, very, hard to keep her from debating Trump.  She will, for example, be given every question IN THE EXACT ORDER and have weeks to rehearse her responses.  She will also get a lot of “mommy” questions – stuff that requires no intelligence to answer, just emoting.  Maybe they can get her to cry so they can run “Trump made girl cry” ads to win a few more white suburban women votes.The key to success on our side?  Simply turning off the tube/web.  They can’t control you if you don’t watch it.

        The American endgame will be Thermodynamics versus Virtual Reality. Here we are in an election cycle wherein the average slob cannot pay his bills or afford groceries but can somehow be convinced to vote for an avatar. Amazingly, our society can still cope with the cognitive dissonance generated by the reality of the grocery store versus the fantasy of the internet. As Zman always says, “we are believing machines”. But even these believing machines require food and shelter.

        What it will ultimately come down to is whether the voters even get to know what happened in meat space. I can see a debate that – even though live – is doctored to make Trump seem like a weird looser. Technology is at the point where you can insert a digital fly into a livestream and it will just sit on Trumps head or circle around it. Next day people will only remember “Flies love Trump like they love turds”. Nobody will remember that Kamala couldn’t say a straight sentence.

        What’s scary is when legitimate sources are also buying into this manipulated reality. I think it was a Seib opinion piece headline I read the other day in the Wall Street Journal. It sounded like he’s gleefully throwing in the towel, more than happy to buy into the narrative that Kumala is creaming Trump. A little bit hopium, a little bit blind stupidity, a little bit too smart by half. Nonetheless, that’s what it sounded like.

        It seems like Fuentes is playing an assigned part, like Spencer in 2020, prepping some “Even [familiar right-wing villain name] turned against Trump! Of course he lost!” for the coming implausible election results. The regime doesn’t need that kind of propaganda anymore, but they do still enjoy it.All your guys are really against youis quality merchandise. Shame to let it rot in the warehouse.However, the particular style of Fuentes’s coming out as a Kamalafag seems more like his immutable characteristics finally became irrepressible. President Brat is getting at least 100% of the gay Mexican vote.Sailer next? He went ridin’ with Biden in 2020 but he “wet-fished it,” as I remember old tough guys saying about nerdy handshakes, so it was mostly overlooked. The Anglo-Puritans failed to position him for success.

        The Regime has done its job of making the Blue God the Godhead and the reasons why you vote for Zherthems are highly moralistic. They have mastered the art of social status and coercion coupled with an extremely ignorant child. For those in the on-line sphere I think they already have their mind made up and the VR world of Harris/Fudd are just supporting mechanisms.What is important here is if enough people have the will to close the border and put in place the financial reforms that will begin the process of mass self-deportation.I am realizing now that I dislike the Dissident Right as a term and that if we want explicit White advocacy then we need to adopt a term that has good optics but that just makes it explicit. The, “conservatives”, are followers. We must lead.The reality of what has been done is likely not to be undone. We must deal with that. It is up to us to bring about an age where White men are reconstituted and despite the forces allied against us, that we express the will to power. We have the numbers to throw our weight around if we organize. East Asians, Jews, and South Asians organize on their ethnic in group. We are going to do the same. Part of what we must do is to be organized and get back to the front foot and throwing our weight around on it. Once we get there, which shouldn’t be that hard, we can form a coalition as needed to deal with the albatross population. All of these groups have in common that their dysfunction must be dealt with. No more running and evading. I think they may make good partners.In the meantime we have work to do. No more despair. No more excuses. Across every class across every field of endeavor it is time to become who we were born and destined to be.

            If Kamala and Tim ‘win’ they may make the country such a shitshow that the foreigners pretending to need amnesty and be refugees will say ef this place and start going back home or at least somewhere else. Especially when their fellow immigrants aren’t all Mexicans or Central Americans, but Africans and Chinese and Haitians that they now have to live around and compete with for resources.That will be new and kind of eerie if they make a mass exodus. I would bet that a lot of them that came here under Biden are already thinking, ‘Whoa, this is not what I thought it would be.’So, Kamala and Tim may accidentally solve the problem.

                Not a chance, Stephanie.
the Cloward-Piven Strategy (look it up) is in full force.
Plus, America is still a LOT nocer than the sh*tholes they came from.
plus: free welfare, sail foams, etc.

                    I’m sorry, sometimes I just have visions of instead of everyone worried over a flood of immigrants coming in we start seeing a flood going out and how that would freak everyone out a little bit. And some successful immigrants are leaving the USA now, after they made their money.

                    Right? You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave. lol And judging by the left’s insane blindness on this issue, well you are fucked if our government is abusing you as an immigrant. It’s bad. Lots of kids working in slaughterhouses and other abuses have been discovered since Biden admin got in. Someone should warn them!

        Personally, I’m quite grateful for today’s, and I hope I’m wrong about everything.Veering from one failure to another, guided by the sentiments I find- hell yes I fell down the internet rabbit hole.
This tablet I bought, intending work on what is most important to me?Can’t get away from it. My interest in the temporal was already tenuous enough, but now I am riveted by the firehose of virtual revolution and online politics.Gotta find my way back to the real world.
