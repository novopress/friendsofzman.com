        I think you missed the point.  Freedom of association principles were violated FUNDAMENTALLY, at the level of the constitution itself, when the North said, “You can’t quit us.”I’d have thought that was pretty obvious, but guess I mustn’t assume reading  comprehension.As to the chimera of slavery as a casus belli, slavery would have solved itself in short order as the mechanization of farm industry made human labor obsolete.  Many have written about this.  So I reject your contention that slavery would not be solved peacefully; it would solve itself.  And, don’t forget, even the vile Lincoln had enough sense to realize the blacks had to go after the civil war.Slaveholding, by the way, was certainly compatible with the Constitution, as the founding fathers owned slaves – they were not the “subjects” of that document, being property.

        Take it back to the beginning:  The slippery slope was actually lost in the War Between the States when the industrial northern states and their vile “leadership,” needing more wage slaves to fuel the burgeoning oligarchic/industrial combine, used the chimera of “Southern slavery” to mobilize, militate, and violate “free association” at the most fundamental level – our legal Constitution of these several united States.

            You may or may not have a point in there somewhere; but how does pushing for the abolition of slavery violate freedom of association principles?  Wouldn’t being held as a slave violate one’s freedom of association?The slavery problem was never going to be solved peacefully.  It was impossible:  The North was right, inasmuch as slaveholding is incompatible with Constitutional principles.  House divided, and all that; the South was right, because they faced not only being deprived of property having been lawfully acquired, but upon manumission, by being surrounded by hostile, bitter, violent, unassimilable former slaves and their descendants in their own lands.  No happy endings possible there.

                Slavery was resolved without bloodshed in Europe! Not easily but without killing people…..the US war against the south was about destroying the south as a political force…..and that was honestly reported in the US CONgress by a northern congressman from Mass. in a resolution approved in 1861, if I remember correctly (Charles Sumner(?)).

        No, I think this is backwards. The Right has always been about centralization of power and control of the lives of the peons, going all the way back to Alexander Hamilton (with only a short detour from their usual path during the FDR regime). It’s the left that has more completely strayed from their initial Jeffersonian roots of “live and let live” to the current form of fascism-flavored socialism.It’s a hard sell to suggest the Right has always been about freedom of association, since things like anti-miscegenation and anti-homosexual laws are generally considered a conservative thing.The 1964 Civil Rights Act took us from a condition where it will illegal to associate with certain others, to another condition where it was illegal not to. Neither side ever considered the possibility that we should be free to choose on our own without government interference.Anyway, it certainly is true that both the words “liberalism” and “conservatism” are now meaningless, which is why we’d be better off rejecting the ruler’s preferred left-right paradigm and adopt one that makes more sense, Rulers vs the Ruled.

        Freedom of association–that’s it!  You have penned a huge essay here, on the means by which the powers that be, the “one world” types and the 0.1%, bind the rest of us to their world view.  It is not freedom of speech, or the right to bear arms, it is the freedom of association.  Not only a physical freedom to live with and transact with the people of your choice, but also the freedoms of political association, personal “wrong-thinking”, and the sharing of that “wrong-thought” (such as this blog).  Trump personifies that wrong-thought, and awakens dormant wrong-thinking in others.  His intimidation of the powers that be is probably underestimated by the rest of us, as he must represent some sort of existential threat to their own ongoing consolidation of power.It seems that the truth is being slowly revealed as if by peeling away the layers of an onion.  Z-Man is one heck of an onion peeler.

        Dinesh D’Souza is convinced Hillary will win, by hook or by crook. If somehow the USA survives 2016, then 2017 will very likely be worse. Before the escalation begins, it would be advisable to put yourself mentally in that place and devise a plan. It may very well be that the US will become one vast unlivable place. That’s the endgame the Left always visits on every country where their will dominates. At some point after Reagan the Republicans abandoned their principles lock stock &amp; barrel. It’s all just going through the motions now. Speaking from January 2017, ‘If Trump had been elected there might have been a chance. But now the nation’s descent can only accelerate. The endgame is upon us. It’s time to activate my escape.’ … Why stay in a country that ended years ago, that hates us, that is seeking only to destroy us?

        “Freedom of association” ultimately comes down to the threat of, or the application of violence. Without that threat any notion of that freedom gets flushed.That’s why the Left is so entrenched in their stance on eroding, and then eliminating, the 2nd amendment.Once that happens here, or once it’s negated enough, only the government and the criminals (I repeat myself) salted within our nation will have a monopoly on coercion.Then even property rights will bite the dust (EPA, BLM, HUD).See what’s happened to the countries within the EU. Merkel, with the not-so-backdoor help of the globalist Soros, is literally commandeering private property in Germany for the musliod invaders.Think it can’t happen here? Look at all the Section 8 housing being taken over in the name of “fairness” and “helping the unfortunate”. Look at the Obama proposal to “level out” the suburban areas with the very minorities that caused “white flight” in the first place.Before I retired in ’84 (taught for years in SpEd in Lynwood, CA, the first city North of Compton) I lived in a very nice condo in Long Beach for two years. In that time six or seven large apartments about three blocks away were given over to Sec. Eight.  Crime skyrocketed within the space of 3-4 months and the neighborhood became unlivable. I had to drive (only during the day…didn’t dare go out at night) 5-6 miles to shop for food after being accosted several times by feral blacks in the nearest store, the final time by females who even grabbed my crotch.I swiftly became a race realist. Now I’m a GOPe realist.Damn right I’m gonna vote for Donald Trump.

        I have read all of Faulkner (although it has been year ago).  My recollection is the smell of verbena rather than honeysuckle.  Of course this is a minor quibble on a very perspicacious essay.

            This stuff continues until people recognize that it is the Blue Wall who FORCE it upon them.  Not until they are willing to rise up and kill EVERY “Law Enforcement” officer who enables this will anything change for the better.  Meanwhile, the Elite stand behind their Blue Wall and laugh.  For they recognize that the Only Ones will do WHATEVER they are told.  As long as that paycheck keeps comin’ in.

        EXACTLY SO.  The “religious freedom” argument used when defending bakeries, florists, photographers and the like forced to accommodate homosexual couples is failing everywhere it’s tried, and that’s because the “Civil Rights” movement, once the vote had been secured*, turned out to be all about access to other people’s stuff.Reopening the debate about who may or may not be permitted to settle in our nation is a vitally important step; but doesn’t, until the homosexualist lobby is shown the door of a more willing business, do anything in particular to restore freedom of association, though.The right at issue is free association, a much broader principle.  These owners of private businesses have all had stripped away the right to associate with — or not — whomever they chose, starting with the Civil Rights act of 1964.*Yes, I know; it enabled the voting of money from the pockets of others more than anything.  At least there’s a defensible principle in there somewhere.
