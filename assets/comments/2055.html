        I read recently in a book on U.S. Presidents that several candidates in the 19th century had floated the idea of paying Spain for Mexico (100 million $) much the same as the purchase of Florida (5 million $).  Mexico would have been carved up into states with borders similar to the current ones, and the U.S. would instantly have millions of new citizens.  Perhaps we should try for something like this again.  The only opposition at the time was from Southern slave states, as Spain had just made slavery illegal.  We are certainly going to have to be creative if we are going to clean up the mess, and a solution like this is not forthcoming from lib/prog/conservative people.  Cuba was also for sale at one time.  Buy ’em out.  That’s how we quadrupeled our resources in a few short years in the past, and seems to be the American way.
