        Biker for forty years. Always wear an excellent (Snell Approved) full face helmet. Multiple downs, singly and with cage assists. No head injuries ever.
Proof positive skid lids work (massive damage / road rash to hands / arms / shoulders notwithstanding).

            Motorcycles are a different deal because of the speeds involved. On a peddle bike, youâ€™re far less likely to take a spill and when it happens it is usually at low speed. Strangely, most people fall off their bikes while at a stop.
The bigger issue is the helmet. Bike helmets are mostly worthless. Motorcycle helmets are much better at protecting the head.

        Meh. My father was rear ended while biking and the styrofoam helmet split (as designed) and his head was fine. Would have been worse sans helmet.
