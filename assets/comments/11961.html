        I discovered an “FM transmitter”, sold wherever earbuds and such are.Plug it into your phone, turn the radio to a specified frequency (say 88.3 or whatever), and it transmits any downloaded playlists or podcasts thru your car soeakers.For dinosaurs like me, driving Flintstone vehicles or reduced to text only, this means I can enter the fancy-shmancy modern world.Been wanting to listen to Batchelor and Savage podcasts for years, and thanks to Zman, I found out that all you do is touch the button.Last week I discovered YouTunes.I finally learned how to download music!Z-casts, here I come!!

Talk radio is near dead since being taken over by the agents of C.U.C.K., Hannity the Moron Cheerleader and Levin the Shrieking Housewife.   Bring the samizdat pirate broadcasts, like something out of “They Live”!

                        Bilejones’ CD suggestion, actually, is rather a capital idea.   Putting it on the list.

        First, I’ve started listening to the podcasts and they’re both informative and entertaining. However, many of the segments (e.g. girl science et al.) are depressing due to their abundance and profundity. I’m not sure it’s helpful to emphasize how bad things are getting in our culture, and I wouldn’t think we are really winning until universities stop hiring the idiots that write those things. It seems to me that society isn’t just carrying the burden of dead-weight anymore, our institutions are now proactively rewarding and growing it like a cancer.

You are deranged.
The first thing that has to be done is to describe and delimit the problem.
You can’t fix what you don’t know is broken.

        Would you please turn down the volume on at least the transition tones? It’s simply too loud, in relation to your spoken volume. I set the volume to a comfortable setting based on your speaking volume, and then BOOM. Are you afraid we’ve fallen asleep?

            I think the levels are pretty dang consistent. Now Pandora, when the ads come on – that’s a jarring volume increase. Z man, fire for effect; this is not chamber music, it’s dissident right polemics. I think you have the tech issues well in hand and need not worry about them. Just my $.02, but I have familiarity with audio, and audio ain’t any problem of yours, IMO. It’s like typos in blogging; not an issue.
But others hear things differently, and all due respect to them. I listen to your podacast on youtube; maybe it’s different on Spreaker.

            I think it’s disgraceful that neither Weinstein nor Spacey molested any young people of color?!  That’s 3 strikes in my book (every day of the week).

            For the last time, there are no such things as “People of Color”. There are Blacks, 57 different types of “Hispanics” ( a classification made up by Nixon, by the way), and several different types of Arabs/Middle Easterners/South Asians, some of which are essentially white, and saw themselves as such, until about fifty years ago, when the gibs train started rolling. They all hate each other’s guts, and would probably have started killing each other already, were it not easier to whine for the aforementioned  gibs from whitey, which are running out, by the way.The “Browning of America”, if it ever happens (doubtful) will not bring peace, but conflict.

            Trent!  Tiny!  (Yes, it’s you – the caps on “People of Color” is a dead giveaway.)Tis’ amazing, but I actually agree with you: The people of color are rejecting white western values – stuff like STEM, and reason, and truthfulness, and honesty, and fairness, and political liberty, and justice, and sanitation, and medicine.  Which is why I’m so confident that they will soon recreate the shithole conditions of their countries of origin, and white men will have to clean up the mess the wogs have made for themselves, just like we did during the 19th century, when white men introduced wogs to radical ideas like not shitting in the street.  People of color do things that people of color do – they just can’t help themselves, and white men will need to look after them like the spoiled stupid children they are.
