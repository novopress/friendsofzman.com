        Ellis is the Madonna of literature. Like her, he keeps reinventing himself — successfully until recently. Both are at the end of their games.

        But once your “talent” wanes with the easily impressionable pop folks, you can make your trade by being the old nasty “controversial” person.Like Dorothy Parker, or L.Lamponelli, or J.Rivers, or E. Asner.Just be sure to do it with the pretense of a “knowing” condescending chuckle. “Kids” THESE days will STILL actually fall for The Emperor’s New Clothes, The Boy Who Cried Wolf, and Henny Penny, too.

        Interesting, I just wrote a post about that article.  Ellis is a dreadful writer and a fascinating man.  He doesn’t write novels, he writes extended monologues – your comic analogy is very apt.  Ellis seems to want to be a screenwriter now, which is insane, given that plot, dialogue and, especially, the creation of character, all of which are essential to drama, are not his strong points.  Micro budget notwithstanding, THE CANYONS is one of the worst films ever made, which is quite an achievement given that Paul Schrader is as close to a genius as you will find in Hollywood.Brett Easton Ellis invented one mildly interesting character, Brett Easton Ellis, whom he has riffed on in one form or another for close to thirty years.  He’s a B-Level cultural icon, a Coke can with a Twitter feed. Ellis sees himself as a Gen X Scott Fitzgerald, the voice of a generation; but he is the voice only of one subset of that generation, the narcissistic, nihilistic, and ultimately spineless component that served as the template for the Millennials that he calls Generation Wuss.  It takes one to know one.

        I only read your excerpts, but in general, I find that Ellis’ characterizations are close to what I’ve seen. I’ve only seen a small sample, and the plural of anecdote is not data, but the Millennials I’ve seen do seem to be much more conformist than any generation I’ve previously seen.
