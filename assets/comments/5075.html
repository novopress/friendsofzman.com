        . Free countries did not do those things. That’s why we fought Hitler
hmmm America did not get involved in ww2 until 1941, long after Hitler rose to power, only after getting attacked.

        Do you mean to tell me that the vast Muslim underclass imported in the name of “diversity” – which we all know to be a great and universal good – must now be “managed” aggresively by technocratic agents of the state in order to achieve the rainbow-hued social perfection and harmony that we have been promised?  I don’t know if they have a sense of humor, but if so the rich and rather grim ironies here must certainly give Sisi and Assad a chuckle.

            I think the management of which you speak is more a continual appeal to the tribes’ elders not to let things get too much out of line. I remember living in one muslim-dominated area where the greatest threat to any miscreant would be the hurt person would “tell the Imam.” Once the Imams become the problem, there isn’t much one can do other than promise more diversity and hope it all works out in the end.

        I don’t know if the journalist who wrote the Evening Standard article was enthusiastic or less so. The important thing is this is that the media are mostly, though not always, likely to be servants of the left. The ones who aren’t tend to keep their mouths shut, but most of the hacks I worked with in my time were members of the NUJ, the British National Union of Journalists. As such, they embraced all things leftwards though oddly, journalists who usually work in mostly comfortable conditions (the joke is that you can go to war zones and risk your life reporting, or sit in the office and type up press releases. Both jobs pay the same) identify themselves as toiling workers forced by nasty capitalist owners to hew rough words in deep and dark places where the chirping canaries expire for lack of a powerful headline. Given they have a lot of stress-free spare time in their job, they tend to eagerly discuss why we should try to make socialism work despite all its myriad failures. Curiously part of making socialism seem wonderful appears to be accepting people into your midst who may not speak English (and thus don’t a flying poo about what lefty journos write) and don’t even care about the UK as a whole.There is also the fact that journos must submit their copy to a sub-editor who, perhaps, is even more lefty than them. I worked for a brief time as a sub editor so you get to have fun with the headlines and alter the text to make it fit in to the holes available. Altering it means any sub can subtly revise the tone of the piece.Plus we mustn’t forget that Tower Hamlets is one of the increasing number of muslim territories in the UK. This borough of east London (not far from the Tower of London) a few years ago applied for city status so they could make their own laws more effectively. I recall interviews with the leaders of towns that wanted to become cities at the time: the best Tower Hamlets’ bosses could come up with was that they had a lot of young people living there. Not sure why that was a good reason for city status, but that was it. They didn’t ‘win’ but still harbour dreams of being an islamic state in the heart of an infidel nation that made the mistake of accepting them as citizens.As for ‘radicalisation’ it seems to me that it comes with the territory of being a muslim. One may as well put them all through a ‘anti-extremism’ adjustment procedure but as almost certainly will not change their fundamental views, it’s all a bit pointless.

        If I remember correctly, Huxley wrote in his afterword forBrave New Worldthat 8% of humans would not “take” the hypnotic conditioning in the studies that he based his novel on.  That is very close to the 10% of children growing up in the very worst conditions who nevertheless turn out to be decent dudes and dudesses.  That number comes up in multiple studies.  I have long suspected that those two populations are really one in the same.  Ten upright men.  Ten percent of the population.
Those are the numbers that give me hope.
