        No wonder Bush 43 went into his dormouse act once Obama was elected. If he was a Saudi protege he was part of the club. The Bushes see themselves as oil royalty, and the Saudis as sort of kin. How we still fell for his all-American everyman schtick even after he evacuated his Saudi pals after 9/11 is incredible. Just goes to show how disoriented everyone was back then.

            I think GWB was like an atomic red pill that made things clear (or at least clear enough to figure out that a con was on) for millions of Trump supporters.

            Just because Babs Bush refers to Saudi Prince Bandar as ‚ÄúBandar Bush,‚Äù and crazy old H.W. calls Bill Clinton a ‚Äúson‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre kin! üòâ
It means the Bush Crime Family is re-affirming their ‚Äúcapos‚Äù within the organization.

            Agreed. The near total silence on the Bush admin connections to Saudi Arabia, the Bin Laden family itself was unreal!
Maybe Obama wasn‚Äôt such a long shot after all. Others have thrown out numbers like 10,000, which, were this a situation akin to playing the lottery would still be a gamble. But the list of suitable candidates shrinks immensely if each must be blood related to certain families.
Come to think of it, Bill Clinton‚Äôs true lineage is suddenly more interesting.

        I don‚Äôt think it is a conspiracy ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs an ecosystem‚Ä¶.those at the top of society select carriers of information (propaganda) in order to use them to influence the culture, to shape the culture so that the culture suits them‚Ä¶this is a process of domestication‚Ä¶just as mankind domesticated livestock by selecting certain animals for their traits‚Ä¶mankind, over thousands of years, selected meaty animals with mild dispositions‚Ä¶and eventually we wound up with domestic livestock‚Ä¶this was a deliberate process, requiring coordinated action‚Ä¶.but it was not a conspiracy‚Ä¶this is a known process‚Ä¶from wikipedia:Who Paid the Piper? The CIA and the Cultural Cold War (U.S. title The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters) is a 1999 book by Frances Stonor Saunders. The book discusses the mid-20th century Central Intelligence Agency efforts to infiltrate and co-opt artistic movements in order to combat political influence from the Soviet Union and expand American political influence,[1] with much funding going through the Congress for Cultural Freedom‚Ä¶.that book details how the american govt, acting in collusion with large nonprofit foundations, selected certain people to act as propaganda carriers in order to shape the culture and politics of other nations‚Ä¶the same thing happened in america‚Ä¶feminism and the new version of Leftism were both deeply influenced by big money from large nonprofit foundations (see the book by dr joan roelofs called Foundations and Public Policy: The Mask of Pluralism)‚Ä¶.those at top of society use organizations and people to disseminate propaganda/information that is used to shape the culture so as to benefit those at the top.This is not conspiracy theory stuff. ‚Ä¶this is the way the world works‚Ä¶been that way for many decades‚Ä¶.mankind is inherently susceptible to propaganda‚Ä¶those at the top of society know this‚Ä¶.mankind‚Äôs vulnerability to propaganda stems from his unique evolutionary background‚Ä¶sociobiologist EO Wilson called mankind the primate that adopted the ant/bee/termite model of social organization‚Ä¶.and like those creatures we are highly regimented animals that depend on passing information along to each other and using that information‚Ä¶see for example the nectar dance of bees‚Ä¶they work together by passing information on to each other‚Ä¶they have a high degree of trust‚Ä¶when a bee comes back from a nectar hunt with information on a trove of flowers, the bee dances to tell the other bees where the flowers are:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dancethe ants/termites use pheromones to pass along information about food etc to other ants‚Ä¶the ants, bees and termites TRUST the information from other ants, bees, termites. ‚Ä¶they would never lie to each other‚Ä¶.likewise, mankind, living in small tribes trusted each other. They would never lie to each other.So when the leaders of the tribes told the members of the tribe the best plan to capture some prey animal, or how to defeat an opposing tribe, whatever, the other members of the tribe listened, internalized that transmitted information, and used it to survive and pass on their genes‚Ä¶the transmission of that complex information helped mankind survive, so we evolved to be able to receive complex information from tribal leaders and then internalize that information and use it to survive and pass on our genes.So, now that mankind has left the tribal milieu, we are now vulnerable to propaganda (information) passed down to us from those at the top. Those at the top of society are no longer part of the tribe. We still trust those at the top. But our trust is misplaced‚Ä¶.Those at the top of society, the elite are actually more like predators, and we are their prey. They are no longer of the tribe. They prey on us by exploiting our vulnerability to information passed down to us from those at the top. Propaganda is generated by the elite‚Ä¶the elite use their money to fund propaganda generators (the media, nonprofit foundations, academia, hollywood etc), and the propaganda generated and disseminated to society is propaganda that will benefit those at the top‚Ä¶.like what, for example?Ok, a Fortune 500 CEO makes millions of dollars. He likes that. He wants to keep on making millions. He knows that if the economy tanks, he will not make millions. He will lose money. He knows that the economy is 75% consumer demand. So he thinks, how can i ensure that consumer demand stays high? Hmm..let‚Äôs get more consumers into america‚Ä¶how can I do that?Ah, immigration! Let‚Äôs lure more immigrants here, and they will work or go on welfare and thus consume. How can I lure immigrants here? Well, he uses his money to donate to politicians. And he asks the politicians to help make sure more immigrants get here‚Ä¶the politician then passes immigration-friendly laws and laws that give welfare to immigrants. Immigrants already here then get welfare, and they tell their friends and family back in the third world to come to america.The CEO also gives money to professors and tells them to generate bogus studies that show that immigration helps americans. The CEO also tells media management to write stories about how immigration helps americans and stories about how white americans who dislike immigration are evil racists. ‚Ä¶the media organizations go along with it because the CEO‚Äôs large company funds the media via advertising purchases‚Ä¶.the pro-immigration propaganda thus generated on behalf of the CEO from academia and media) is thus disseminated through society‚Ä¶.multiply this scenario by hundreds of times over decades and we see how society and culture is shaped and molded by information disseminated from those at the top of society. A process of domestication. But NOT a conspiracy. Instead, it‚Äôs an ecosystem.

            Just finished Attkisson‚Äôs new book ‚ÄúSmear‚Äù.   Quite a good look into how much of journalism has become ‚Äútransactional‚Äù.  Rather like the ants, not a far reaching conspiracy, but each acting by a combination of basic ideology x greed x laziness x desire to be in the ‚Äúin‚Äù crowd.  And bingo, you get the reason the Fusion GPS people are terrified to releasing the records of who they paid for what.

            It is important not to draw too many unnecessary distinctions between conspiracy and environment  (ecosystem). Both are impacted by things outside of anyone‚Äôs control; however, both also involve people and planning. The line between these things blur.

        You can‚Äôt dismiss conspiracy theory any longer. Too much of it has turned into conspiracy fact. I remember when people were poo-poo-ing ECHELON as conspiracy theory. WRONG, it was conspiracy fact.
There are ghosts and monsters out there. And they do move the world.

            Conspiracy is just legal jargon for ‚Äúagreement to commit an illegal act‚Äù.
It does not require ‚Äúghosts and monsters‚Äù any more than a simple pact between a gunman and a driver to rob a bank does! Its a simple human endeavor.
Only those who wish to discredit the obvious, give supernatural connotations to the word ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù; mostly as a means of hiding the  crime!

        I had heard something a long while back about Saudis bankrolling a number of young Americans.  I figured it was planting lots of seeds and betting that a few would successfully take root.
My question has always been, if someone was doing that, how many other potential Obamas are out there?

            This. For every Obama or other semi-successful Saudi-sponsored politician walking the streets, there are a thousand other Saudi-sponsored losers who took the money and ran. It‚Äôs the cost of doing business.
Most of your writing on the deep state has been focused at the level of civil servants. This story in no way invalidates your position.

                I agree, losses are to be expected. They hit the jackpot with Obama. However, did the Saudis foresee him siding with Iran against them? That could not have been part of their plan as Iran is now so much a threat to the Saudis existence that they are aligned with Israel against them. This kind of unintended and sometimes disastrous consequence is what happens when you interfere at the micro and macro level in human relations, especially when hate is your prime motivation.

            Yes ‚Äì shotgun approach. Even if they don‚Äôt hit the target directly (as noted below, they kind of hit the jackpot but for ValJar) they‚Äôd get a lot of sympathetic people. Target degrees in the legal/social/educational/management classes and build ground level support.
Given the recent Islamophilia in education in very Christian Southern states, I wonder how many early education degrees have been funded by similar programs

            I believe it.  He was playing a role even then.  Don‚Äôt forget that his unusual family background would make him a target, even in a place like Hawai‚Äôi, so he became the class ‚Äúshow off.‚Äù  His mother was far away, re-married to an Indonesian guy; his namesake father was supposedly an African government functionary, but more likely he was sired by a creepy Communist Party news reporter (Frank Marshall Davis) sent from Chicago to keep an eye on the docks, along with Harry Bridges.  I have always thought that his white grandparents, the Dunhams, were in league with Communists also.  They had been acquainted with Davis in Kansas, where they all originally hailed from.  Definitely difficult for a young half-black kid to navigate the social minefields at his private school, where the old-timer haole (white) families ran the place.  These rich folks produced lots of loser-kids, too, as the 70s were pretty icky with drugs so available, but it gave Barry the ‚Äúgolden‚Äù opportunity to learn the M. O. and social mores of the upper crust which has stood him in very good stead thru the years.That‚Äôs why he sounds and looks like such a phony when he tries to ‚Äúget down‚Äù with the urban jargon and be-bops around snapping his fingers.  And it‚Äôs why Michelle never learned how to act as she was ghetto all the way ‚Äî and it shows.  I think Barack is embarrassed by her, but it was she that enabled his success as a candidate.  If he had pulled a Tiger Woods/OJ Simpson and married a silky-haired blonde, he would have led a nice suburban life someplace, but would never have risen to be President.  Also, he‚Äôs gay, so the attractiveness‚Äìor lack of‚Äìdisplayed by his bride matters not at all to him, obviously;-)

                The Kenyan Dad thing gave him a more interesting back story, and allowed him to game the education system and the media, which was much more willing to speak generously of an exotic half-black with Kenyan blood.  Being the son of a commie Chicago sleaze bag does not get you the educational goodies, and it leads the outside observer to distrust what statements Obama might have been making.Speaking of Obama‚Äôs statements, away from the script and the teleprompter, he cannot make a coherent argument.  He also feels the need to stray from his scripts, knowing full well that his extemporaneous statements will betray him.  He just feels the need to do so.  I think it is a combination of his desire to be seen as more than a talking head, and also the deep need to get out the anger that he carries with him, every day.  He is not a happy or fulfilled person, that much is obvious.

        The Left, as well as the Right, but the Left is much, much better at it, has for quite some time devoted a lot of effort into developing ‚Äúbench strength.‚Äù  Money from Leftist-supporting sources is quietly funneled to potential candidates who may support their ideology. It‚Äôs worth it to sink a few bucks into the campaign of the county councilman who may wind up as a state legislator and potentially advance to Congress and maybe to the Presidency.Yes, it‚Äôs a very long game with no guarantee of success; in fact, I‚Äôm sure there are way more losers than winners,but the Left has vast financial resources to invest (Ex: see: Soros, George; Arabia, Saudi;et al). So does the Right, actually, but is either too selfish to copy the Left,  just not bright enough to understand the Long Game process, of simply focused on the immediate. Probably a combination of the three. And, while only one, or two, out of multiple years of 10K/year may ever get to be President, that doesn‚Äôt mean the potential payoff from investing in county officials, state legislators, Congressmen and Senators is zero.The odds on winning the Powerball lottery is 275 million to one, but millions of people still buy tickets.Investing $20 million/year is couch-cushion-change if it pays off in billions (it takes 50 years for $20M/year to reach $1B), and I‚Äôd wager the payoff on Obama was much, much greater than $1 billion. Plus, even if the Saudis were writing those $20M checks, we don‚Äôt know if all the $20M was coming from their accounts, nor do we know where all that $20M went, or how much more than $20M might have been invested, from any other sources. Could any have gone to Hollywood for use in movies and TV shows to change American attitudes? How much was invested in ‚Äúscholarships‚Äù which wound up benefiting, say, some who wound up working in network news?

            No different than the venture capital game.  Of twenty investments you expect fifteen to go to zero, four to have enough success that you extract your investment via an early sale or liquidation of the IP (depending on how clever you are at getting senior rights to the company IP) and one is a blockbuster.  The political pyramid is no different.  They all meet your screening criteria at the outset, but only a few have the right combo of right idea and right time to really succeed.

                Bill Clinton attended Georgetown University in Washington DC, not Harvard.  US Senator Wm Fulbright from AR was his patron there.  Bill got a Rhodes Scholarship and went to England (forget if it was Oxford or Cambridge U.) and hung out with other Rhodes Scholars like Strobe Talbott from Yale and whats-his-name Reich, both of whom served during the Clinton Presidential Administrations.  Bill Clinton got back from Europe w/o finishing a Master‚Äôs degree, and went to Yale Law School.  That‚Äôs where he met Hillary.  Bill‚Äôs mother was a private duty nurse, not sure if she was R.N.  Her 2nd husband was a reasonably well-to-do car dealer in Hot Springs.  She had enough money to gamble in that sin-hole and got to take care of some very important men.

        Is this not also related to Valerie Jarrett, whose father-in-law was a close confidant of the attorney that administered the Saudi sponsorship of minorities?  The plan was to sponsor thousands of students, but it appears that Obama was one of the few who were actually sponsored.  I recall that an obscure St. Petersburg Florida newspaper article from decades ago laid all of this out as it was beginning to be implemented. The article was authored by Vernon Jarrett, Valerie‚Äôs father-in-law. References linking the Saudis, Vernon Jarrett, and Obama were supposed to have been scrubbed from the record, but because this small Florida newspaper was not included in the digitization of the historical record, it was overlooked.  A copy of the physical newspaper, citing the sponsorship, was discovered and publicized some years back, then it was all quickly dropped.

            al-Mansour (real name Donald Warden), an associate of Bobby Seale and the Black Panther Party, was the attorney representing the Saudis, Vernon Jarrett was a friend of his and the father-in-law of Valerie Jarrrett, and another of Vernon Jarrett‚Äôs close circle of friends was Frank Marshall Davis, a friend of Obama‚Äôs mother and grandparents.  Davis and the Jarretts operated out of Chicago.  Davis is rumored to have been Obama‚Äôs real father, and was Obama‚Äôs father figure during his teenage years.Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Vernon Jarrett, al-Mansour, the Saudis, Frank Davis, Chicago, the Black Panthers, it‚Äôs all a closed loop.Perhaps some of the Saudi arrests going on now is a breaking up of that closed loop, well after the fact.

                When Obama was trying to sell Chicago as a site for the Olympics, he was asking a billion dollars for the slum Projects he had ‚Äòorganized‚Äô when young.Valerie Jarrett owned those.  The other half, already sold off for redevelopment, were owned by Michelle‚Äôs father, John Robinson.The Russians have a word for Deep State.  That word is ‚Äòbiznis‚Äô.What we‚Äôre seeing is an unacknowldged economy.  Examples are Mafia or Cartel business- or Cayman Islands havens, nonprofit foundations, shell companies, equity/hedge funds, governmental interagency finance, black budgets.The lack of transparency- their books aren‚Äôt public- doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist.  It means we keep getting blindsided.

        Barry Soetoro was a ‚Äúresident‚Äù of Indonesia for many years after his adoptive father took him there.  Indonesian law only allowed Indonesian citizens the ability to live and school there.  Soetoro, aka obama,was and may still be an Indonesian citizen.  Not only was the scoundrel NOT a natural born citizen he was an Indonesian moslem citizen. He was ineligible to be POTUS.  But, the Deep State protected the truth.  Many lawsuits were attempted to make Barry and the Deep State accountable.But, every federal, black-robed bandit ruled the plaintiff had ‚Äúno standing‚Äù to challenge soetoro‚Äôs legitimacy or lack thereof !Barry, the federal judiciary and Barry‚Äôs handlers should be swinging from a short rope and a tall tree.Th bloodless coup d‚Äôetat installing soetoro was executed by the Deep State.

            As I mentioned in my comment above, I really believe Frank Marshall Davis is Barack Obama‚Äôs biological father.  The photographic evidence nails it!  This is Obama‚Äôs ace-in-the hole ‚Äî that he is indeed a ‚ÄúNatural-Born Citizen,‚Äù per the requirements of the US Constitution.  Did you ever notice how unconcerned he was about the subject of his birth?  He was openly mocking of people like Donald Trump who wanted to investigate this matter.  However, no one in the press/Democrat Party had the stomach to call the first African-American man to be elected President of the USA, a bastard, which truly was the case, so they left it lie there and never could bring themselves to pursue this.  Also, he was a ‚Äúgood‚Äù candidate and won handily both times.Remember how no one went out to Hawai‚Äôi when Barack‚Äôs grandmother was ill during the first campaign?  No recent pictures of him with her, or any stories from his upbringing from locals who might have known him.  All very blurry.  In the White House he was surrounded by women who doted on him: Valerie, Susan Rice, Michelle.  No straight white males could break into that little coven.  Protecting lots of secrets, that crew would literally die for him.

                If the Democrats manage to make a clean break, free of both the Clinton and Obama crime organizations, the revelations that will be forthcoming about those two clans are going to be epic.  The files used to buy political omert√†, held by Bill, Hill, and Barack, are likely thorough and damning on everyone.  But as we careen into full disclosure and full accusation on sex lives, personal abuse, and other nasty habits, the willingness to face the potential personal destruction consequences of whistleblowing appears to be rising.  It is now  ‚Äúcool‚Äù to disclose and ‚Äúuncool‚Äù to retaliate.  The worm is turning.

                Dr. Dre,‚Äú‚Ä¶.the first African-American man to be elected President of the USA‚Ä¶.‚ÄùWell, well, well‚Ä¶.you chime right in with the language of the Amerikan left.  As the story goes barry soetoro, aka obama, was the product of a caucasian female and a negro male.  50/50, white/dark.  Neither a negro or a caucasian.  A mulatto.  A half-breed and a bastard to boot !HTF is it barry happens to be, in the language of the Amerikan Left, ‚ÄúAfrican-American‚Äù ?  Why don‚Äôt you and your pals on the Left refer to the moslem, Taqiyaa-practicing, communist as a white male, a caucasian ?  If half-negro can be ‚ÄúAfrican-American‚Äù, how is it that same half-breed, half caucasian not be ‚Äúwhite ‚Äì Amerikan‚Äù ?  It wouldn‚Äôt fit the meme of the Marxist Left, would it ?  And you in your collectivist, do-as-they-say mentality, join right in using the propaganda and Lies of the Left !Oh, and you conveniently omit any reference to soetoro-obama‚Äôs Indonesian years as an Indonesian citizen and moslem.  Thus, you can argue the Frank Davis fatherhood crap all you want.  The fact is he was and still is, an Indonesian citizen.  In turn, again not eligible for POTUS.Hell, you make arguments supporting the Amerikan Left.  Imagine that !

                    African-American is the current, socially acceptable way to refer to someone of black African descent, more or less light or dark.  I did not invent this term but have noticed how it has achieved common usage since the 1980s.  The term ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù was OK starting in the 60s; I remember as a child that ‚ÄúColored‚Äù was considered a polite way to speak of Negro people.  It is still in use, e. g. the NAACP, and I have heard the phrase ‚Äúpeople of color‚Äù in high-toned venues, such as PBS.  So, we defer to the AA-B-Cs to determine what is permitted, otherwise there‚Äôs a terrible fuss, and we can‚Äôt have that, can we?  Everyone turns flip-flops to avoid using the awful n-word, even in private conversation, so we palefaces eager not to offend do require occasional updating on the approved lingo.  Lots of Mitch McConnell Republicans hope that if they simply use the correct word black people might actually vote for them.  I guess my post‚Äôs sarcasm went over your head DAN III.  You are quite wrong in thinking me a leftist.  Your spittle-flecked fulminations will hardly win you adherents on the Right.  No one enjoys being around an gasbag, gnomesayin?By the way, Obama‚Äôs Indonesian sojourn did not raise too much concern in his American political progress; sort of the way that Ted Cruz‚Äôs Canadian birth didn‚Äôt slow him up too much either.  Other factors brought Cruz down.  These observations most certainly do not mean I endorse ignoring  America‚Äôs rather simple ground rules for public officials to follow to serve under the U. S. Constitution.  What was done by those in power to advance Barack Obama‚Äôscase was truly evil, IMO, and should not go unpunished.

                If Frank Marshall Davis is indeed Barack Obama‚Äôs actual father, then Obama is qualified to be POTUS under the NBC clause of the constitution. However, would not Obama then be guilty of misrepresenting himself to the public during the certification process of the nomination, as well as during the campaign proper?Obama is accomplished at very few things, but we know the man lies as naturally as he breathes. Fraud on this scale is truly breath-taking; Obama and his handlers were nothing if not skilled grifters in pulling off the biggest political con-job in American political history. However, the ‚Äúaudacity‚Äù of the thing ‚Äì to use one of his favorite words ‚Äì makes it no less illegal.Of course, I am engaged in wishful thinking, for men like Barack Obama have the enormous and unaccountable clout of the deep-state behind them, a sort of perpetual ‚Äúget out of jail ‚Äòfree‚Äô card‚Äù in their back pockets. Barry O. ‚Äì or whatever his real name is ‚Äì won‚Äôt do time for his enormous crimes. Far from it; the man has already gotten rich off of them and stands to get even wealthier when his memoirs are published.

                    It is/was a terrible con-job.  Dreadful.  I remember getting a creepy feeling that the fix was in and we were being set-up for this way back in 2004, I think it was, the Democrat National Convention, when John F‚Äôing Kerry became the candidate vs. President GWB.  Obama gave the ‚Äúkeynote‚Äù address and the press etc. all had a collective orgasm at his wonderfulness.  This just built with Bush barely defeating Kerry, who fought in Vietnam, ya know.  Bush‚Äôs 2nd term bit the dust in a hurry, to no one‚Äôs great disappointment, ending in the bank bailout mess in Sept 2008.  All this energy directed to an Obama candidacy also did in Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs first attempt at seeking the Presidency.  And awful candidate John McCain did a lousy job advocating for the Republican cause.  It was weird how McCain selected Sarah Palin, though.  The one bright spot in his sour slog to defeat.Anyway, something/someone behind the scenes carefully placed the marionette Barack Hussein Obama on the stage to dance, posture and charm us for 8 long years.  That‚Äôs it ‚ÄîBarack IS Pinocchio ‚Äî the lying little boy.  So, who IS Geppetto?

        Power hates a vacuum. Democracy is a vacuum awaiting a conspiracy, because power must go to the trouble of shaping the thoughts of people it does not respect. The Saudis did not imagine they would bag a President, or need to. No one needs to that is working against the interests of the country. Executive leadership is essential for preserving the interest of the country.The FBI, CIA, Justice,  and State have revealed themselves to be zealously Deep State in committing to crippling a watershed election. Like ants, they do not need direction, but understand what must be done because that is what they were always doing.

        If you are old enough to remember just how much in petrodollars was sloshing around in those days, why not invest a fraction in those that might prove sympathetic and useful later on.  Went to a very similar school to Obama at exactly the same time.  Finding candidates would not have been hard. Elite schools + minorities sympathetic to the ‚Äúcause‚Äù was not exactly a screamingly large cohort.  My working theory on the transcripts at Columbia and Occidental was always that they wished to hide the courses he took, not the grades.  The removal of meaningful distribution requirements plus the rise in pablum level black studies and Marxist based courses that infested political ‚Äúscience‚Äù, economics and history departments, meant a guy like Obama could take steady diet of ‚ÄúWhy White Colonialists Are Really Really Bad People‚Äù courses and get a degree.   Saw that up close when I took a ‚ÄúThird World Literature‚Äù course.  Professor was visiting from Oxford.  Was probably one of three whites in the class. Problem was, being from Oxford, this guy actually expected people to read the books, write their papers and discuss the material with a decent working knowledge.  This came a real shock to all the Black Studies (it was called that back then) who enrolled expecting another easy ‚ÄúA‚Äù for groupthink.  The one positive was back then, whitey would still raise his/her/zhir hand and have a comment, question or observation without being shouted down for privilege or some such bullshit.

        My realization that suboptical skullduggery was real was when Nancy Pelosi used the word ‚ÄúAstroTurf‚Äù with such unconscious facility when talking about the Tea Party. I knew right away that if there was a lexicon used out of the public eye about political theater, that there were likely other activities using their own language at other levels that we never see. I‚Äôm not saying that I know what these are. It‚Äôs just that when you find a fossilized bone it‚Äôs a good assumption that there‚Äôs a beast of which it is a part.

        Sometime around 2000 or 2001 when I had my first PC I stumbled onto a video of Obama walking a college campus and been exalted as the coming first black president.  The video is the source of the black and white photos you see of Obama wearing a fedora. In the video you see afro wearing blacks playing dominos and smoking weed. These other brothers do things like obligatory black power first and tell you the star of the video will be the first black president.I didn‚Äôt think much of it and would never had even remembered it probably except years later here is this same guy being worshiped on his charge to the Whitehouse.  All seemed contrived and curious to me so I went ‚Äúvetting‚Äù myself in search of who/what this Obama was/is.It‚Äôs said the internet is forever but I challenge anyone to find the video.

        20 million a year? Man, that is CHEAP if it gets you a president for 8 years. (Not to mention the slew of other high level operatives)
But it makes me wonder how this ties in with ‚Äòdrain the swamp‚Äô and the current upheaval in S.A.

            That‚Äôs what I noticed.   We weren‚Äôt watching Trump‚Äôs pimp hand- he is attacking the Royal allies of the two cojoined crime families that have nearly destroyeed this nation, the Bush/Clinton marriage of the Dixie and Gulf mafias (thanks again, LBJ).Jared Kushner and Mnuchkin visited SA the week before Salman Jr‚Äôs coup.Trump‚Äôs tax plan attacks the main funding sources of the Cloud mafia economy- ‚Äòredevelopment‚Äô, ‚Äòfoundations‚Äô, ‚Äònonprofits‚Äô, ‚Äòredistribution‚Äô, etc.The fiefdoms contending in the game of thrones are money laundry centers fed by smuggler‚Äôs ports: Chicago-SanFran/Seattle (DSA, Democrat Socialist Alliance), NYC-Florida (Hillary, Jeb, Zetas), Los Angeles-Laredo TX (DSA, Bush/Salinas, Sinaloa).This guy really means it.Their nuclear salvo,  the Mortgage Meltown, was a declaration of war.  Their SJW colonels entered the field with weaponized immigrants and minorities.Trump is the retaliation, the counterstrike.White Right, Unite!  General Washington is here (and making the same necessary compromises with the Colonies).

                    Yes, ever since Lucky Luciano moved to Hot Springs, AR in 1943.

            Dutch, I think that it was one faction* within what I call the ‚Äúmovement‚Äù jumping the gun.  The second Intifada was perceived as enormously successful.  Hezb‚Äôallah had kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon, and the Pakistanis had set off a few A-bombs a couple of years earlier (the A.Q. Khan network seemed to have the support of insiders from Mauretania to Malaysia).  There was open source data of good provenance (I have started to save that sort of thing in last six months or so‚Ä¶ I never did in those days) showing the the amount of ‚Äúzakat‚Äù (charity) going to the radical jihadi faction had started to increase exponentially (not a term I use imprecisely) starting in the late 1990s.There was a certain sense of inevitability in the movement at the time.  The radical jihadis had installed a Salafist state in Afghanistan and had made inroads elsewhere, especially in Sudan and Somalia. The Institutionalists were building Wahhabi mosques all over Dar al Islam and Europe and putting Saudi-trained imams in them; they were breaking the back of Sufi Islam.  The Dawists, building on the successes of the Institutionalists, were making many converts to the one, true Wahhabi faith.Sunni organizations are not hierarchical.  They are networked, almost feudal.  My guess is that someone that one of the big donors on the Arabian peninsula thought the time was right and green lighted Bin Laden.  Sixteen years later we are still fighting these fuxors in this weird, Islamic war where one hand clasps yours in friendship while the other slips in the dagger.  Our biggest mistake continues to be to fight them by their rules.* The movement factions:‚Ä¢ The Intitutionalists.  Religious Sunni princes who believe in the triumph of Islam.  They fund the various Wahhabi outreach programs like the mosque building and imam training efforts.  Another example would be the magazine that Huma Abedin‚Äôs mother (and formerly her late father) runs.‚Ä¢ The Dawists.  A more conservative faction seeking to spread Islam via conversion and emigration.  Less is known about it.  Includes groups like the Tablighi.‚Ä¢ The Radical Jihadis.  We all know who these guys are.  Al Qaeda and IS are two front organizations.

                I think your key statement is that ‚ÄúSunni organizations are not hierarchical‚Äù.  So different factions are doing different things, which is why you see counterproductive (for them) movements and events.  But it also makes it almost impossible to either organize them or cut off the head of the snake (see Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan).
The Saudis are giving it a try, now.  It will be interesting to see how effective they are at it. I assume they are getting help from Israel behind the scenes.  As for help from the U.S., who knows?

            Bush needed his own ‚ÄúPearl Harbor‚Äù as an excuse for invading Iraq!His Saudi buddies providing the executing crew of fundamentalist Wahhabis to fly the planes and Larry Sliverstein leased the ‚ÄúPotemkin‚Äù target in the form of the failing business venture known as the WTC, which he immediately insured against destruction by terrorism, for billions of dollars! (The WTC couldn‚Äôt have been lawfully and inexpensively demolished or re-habbed since it was full of asbestos.)In a masterful piece of kabuki theatre, the planes crashed into the WTC Twin Towers, previously rigged for implosion. Miraculously, the Twin Towers became the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù high rise buildings to ever fall due to ‚Äúfires‚Äù and n minor structural damage. Not only that, but they fell neatly into a confined space making for easy clean-up and removal of debris(Evidence).Voila! Bush got his war. Silverstein got $14 billion and the right to own and construct brand new NYC office space and the Bush Crime Family profited by solidifying their ties to the Sauds, whom Bush helped evacuate form the US, at whatever profit to the Bush coffers.Don‚Äôt believe it? Then explain what happened to all the bodies, office equipment, computers, toilets and other debris normally associated with explosion and collapse of a large building!  There was none!

        It is becoming more and more obvious, the more I have read and heard over the past couple years, that American culture, including political culture, has been controlled and influenced in a way that is more top-down and planned than is commonly believed.  The whole history from 1950 to the present has to be re-written if we want to know the full story.

            Good point. Still, you can make an inbred Arab rich and ambitious but you can‚Äôt make him smart. And Persians are not Arabs, better at the long game.  CIA is also very involved in placing and moving pieces, and facilitating others that do. Their fingerprints are all over the Dunhams. We are raised to believe CIA is right wing but in fact they are the of the same minds as State.

            It is a real puzzle, as one can identify both Persian Shia and Saudi Sunni threads through many of the people and events of the last fifty years.  For example, Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran and seemed to steer the Iran deal that vexes both the U.S. and the Saudis.  Yet the Saudis, through Jarrett‚Äôs relatives and network, greased the way for Obama to rise through the system.  At the end of the day, the Shia and Sunni probably hate each other with more passion than they hate Israel or the U.S.I sense that the Saudi Sunnis are turning more fratricidal in an intramural way, and Trump‚Äôs people are putting the screws to them from the outside.  The oil reserves are running out. And here comes an angry and powerful Iran armed with nukes and a big bankroll, with lots of oil left.  Trump is offering the Saudis an out and U.S. backing that is conditional, the condition being that terms are very good for the U.S. if Trump is going to play ball.This makes the current Saudi coup/countercoup/whatever-it-is a real hail-mary event for them.  In a few years, we will look back on it as either an event that precipitated a lot of bad news, or something that headed off a bad situation.

            Matt, that‚Äôs a very good question, one I have pondered as well‚Ä¶For what they‚Äôre worth, here are the possible explanations I‚Äôve developed.I have satisfied myself from the evidence available that Obama is a Muslim, and de facto (if not actually de jure) a member of the most-influential pan-Islamic organization on earth, the Muslim Brotherhood. I won‚Äôt debate the pros/cons of my conclusion; I merely state it as one of the premises of my arguments.We know that the Sunni and Shi‚Äôite sects of Islam have been quarreling with one another for centuries, and that their favorite thing to do ‚Äì when they aren‚Äôt slaying infidels, that is ‚Äì consists of fighting with one another about Islamic doctrine and many other things as well.We also know that the Sunni Arabs, in particular the House of Saud, are deeply-concerned, even frightened, by the prospect of losing their status as the hegemons of Islam and the keepers of its holy places in Mecca and Medina. Why, the Saudis are so concerned that they formed a strategic alliance with the hated Israelis in order to oppose Iran. Who saw that one coming ‚Äì the Jews and the Arabs as allies?The Iranians, who are not only Shi‚Äôites, but non-Arabs as well (they are Persians), despise the Arabs and resent their second class status within the Islamic world.These sectarian conflicts are quite enough to keep tensions high, but layered on top of them are the rivalries in the energy development trade. The Arabs and their coalition allies, including the U.S., NATO, Israel and Turkey, have pipeline development projects of their own which exclude the Shi‚Äôites and their allies the Russians, Chinese and Syrians ‚Äì just as their opposite numbers have projects of their own which would exclude the Arabs. Billions, perhaps trillions, in revenues are at stake.The Arabs bought-and-paid for Obama, believing in him they would possess a hole card with which to trump (no pun intended!) any unfavorable action by Iran. However, Obama ended up siding with Tehran as much as he did with Riyadh. Obama himself is probably a Sunni, given his lineage ‚Äì so why would he side with Iran?The key is the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization Obama obviously favors and favored during his time in the White House. The Ikhwan have long-opposed the Saudi monarchy as corrupt, too westernized, and decadent ‚Äì poor Muslims if not apostates. The Ikhwan have wanted them removed from power for a long time, and a Muslim Brotherhood ruler put in place, someone more favorable to their fundamentalist strain of Islamic doctrine.So, one possibility for Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúflip‚Äù to the Iranians is that he is supporting the MB. Having milked his Saudi connections for all they‚Äôre worth, he is free to discard them and show his true colors.Another possibility is that Obama simply doesn‚Äôt like being attached to anyone‚Äôs puppet-strings, Saudi or otherwise, and acted in a contrary manner simply to prove his independence. A narcissist like Obama would want to prove to himself that he could ‚Äúbe great‚Äù without outside help.Recently, it has come to light that Osama Bin Laden was on friendly terms with Iran and the mullahs in the years and months before his death. This raises the intriguing and I believe plausible possibility that all of the ‚ÄúSunnis vs. Shi‚Äôites‚Äù conflict is widely-exaggerated, a form of strategic taqiyya waged to dupe the foolish infidels into believing that they could trust Muslims.Make no mistake ‚Äì the Sunni-Shi‚Äôite divide exists and is real ‚Äì but history shows that one of the few things capable of getting these sects to cooperate is the chance to slaughter some infidels. Viewed in this context, Obama‚Äôs flip-flopping from Sunni to Shi‚Äôite and back again can be seen for what it is ‚Äì taqiyya designed to fool uninformed observers as his true intentions and the true intentions of his allies, Sunni and Shi‚Äôite alike.My point, one supposes, is that to a devout Muslim, an infidel is an infidel, whereas a fellow believer, even one belonging to another sect, is a fellow member of the umma.

                Very, very well done.Shias and Sunnis work together frequently; their families intermarry frequently as well.
An Iraqi soldier said he couldn‚Äôt understand the American insistence on the split, as families, such as his own, (a Shia wife), married across the Iran border and were constantly crossing for visits.
The Brotherhood.  Their Project 2020.We had forgotten about them after Egypt.  And Obama‚Äôs narcissism.Excellent.

                    Which leads to another difficult conclusion.  If Saudi Arabia manages to reconstitute itself as a somewhat milder and more forward thinking version of itself, and gets back on its feet again, what is to stop them from co-ordinating with Iran to start putting the screws to the West again?

        I‚Äôm not sure the ‚Äúhow‚Äù is all that hard ‚Äì it‚Äôs plainly a numbers game, where you hope that a few of the ones you fund wind up coming to prominence a few decades hence.If you are in the prince‚Äôs position back in the 80s, you likely know professors at a couple dozen top universities who are already in your debt or in ideological agreement. You ask each for the most promising students they‚Äôve seen in the last couple years. You meet the kids and decide if you want to place a bet on each one. It seems pretty straightforward.The bigger mystery is why nobody else is playing this game. $20M is not a lot of money. Maybe some conservative rich guys should look into this instead of blowing a wad on their favorite college football team.

        I could go on and on about the Dunham/0bama family connections to US intelligence agencies, but rather than put on my tinfoil hat, I‚Äôll just quote Angelo Codevilla:‚ÄúConsistent with the Barack Obama we know, however, are his real family, his real upbringing, and his real choices of profession and associates. His mother‚Äôs parents, who raised him, seem to have been cogs in the U.S. government‚Äôs well-heeled, well-connected machine for influencing the world, whether openly (‚Äúgray influence‚Äù) or covertly (‚Äúblack operations‚Äù). His mother spent her life and marriages, and birthed her children, working in that machine. For paradigms of young Barack‚Äôs demeanor, proclivities, opinions, language, and attitudes one need look no further than the persons who ran the institutions that his mother and grandparents served‚Äîe.g., the Ford Foundation, the United States Information Agency, and the Central Intelligence Agency‚Äîas well as his chosen mentors and colleagues. It is here, with these people and institutions, that one should begin to unravel the unknowns surrounding him.‚Äùhttp://www.claremont.org/crb/article/the-chosen-one/People think it‚Äôs odd how Barry Soetero just magically seemed to get the breaks at every turn, and there‚Äôs no denying it.  But really, it all started with his mom, Stanley Anne Dunham.  In what world does a young woman with no more than a BA in Anthropology from the University of Hawaii start scoring big money grants from the Ford Foundation to ‚Äústudy‚Äù the natives in Indonesia? The kind of grants that PhDs on real faculties would kill for?  Only in a world in which Stanley is actually working for the company.

        This is the Manchurian Candidate narrative, and it‚Äôs the only one that makes sense to me, given Obama‚Äôs nearly total lack of record and credentials at the time of his campaign. Hell, we still don‚Äôt know his GPA, nor do we have an admission from him, even in the face of multiple contemporaneous witnesses who knew him at the time, that he was enrolled at Occidental as a foreign student.

        I‚Äôve been reading this 150-year-old account of a white Brit in Africa, describing the different tribes and the ways of Africans. Can‚Äôt believe how it resonates with the society we see around us. Our leaders seem to be on the path of decriminalizing criminal behavior as way to appease the savages among us. This will hasten our turning 3rd world.‚ÄúThe history of the negro has proved the correctness of this theory. In no instance has he evinced other than a retrogression, when once freed from restraint. Like a horse without harness, he runs wild, but, if harnessed, no animal is more useful. Unfortunately, this is contrary to public opinion in England, where the vox populi assumes the right of dictation upon matters and men in which it has had no experience. The English insist upon their own weights and measures as the scales for human excellence, and it has been decreed by the multitude, inexperienced in the negro personally, that he has been a badly-treated brother; that he is a worthy member of the human family, placed in an inferior position through the prejudice and ignorance of the white man, with whom he should be upon equality.‚Äù‚ÄúIn his state of slavery the negro was compelled to work, and, through his labour, every country prospered where he had been introduced. He was suddenly freed; and from that moment he refused to work, and instead of being a useful member of society, he not only became a useless burden to the community, but a plotter and intriguer, imbued with a deadly hatred to the white man who had generously declared him free.‚ÄúNow, as the negro was originally imported as a labourer, but now refuses to labour, it is self-evident that he is a lamentable failure. Either he must be compelled to work, by some stringent law against vagrancy, or those beautiful countries that prospered under the conditions of negro forced industry must yield to ruin, under negro freedom and idle independence. For an example of the results look to St. Domingo!‚Äù‚ÄúIt was amusing to watch the change that took place in a slave that had been civilized (?) by the slave-traders. Among their parties there were many blacks who had been captured, and who enjoyed the life of slave-hunting ‚Äî nothing appeared so easy as to become professional in cattle razzias and kidnapping human beings, and the first act of the slave was to procure a slave for himself! All the best slave-hunters, and the boldest and most energetic scoundrels, were the negroes who had at one time themselves been kidnapped. These fellows aped a great and ridiculous importance. On the march they would seldom condescend to carry their own guns; a little slave boy invariably attended to his master, keeping close to his heels, and trotting along on foot during a long march, carrying a musket much longer than himself: a woman generally carried a basket with a cooking-pot, and a gourd of water and provisions, while a hired native carried the soldier‚Äôs change of clothes and oxhide upon which he slept. Thus the man who had been kidnapped became the kidnapper, and the slave became the master, the only difference between him and the Arab being an absurd notion of his own dignity. It was in vain that I attempted to reason with them against the principles of slavery: they thought it wrong when they were themselves the sufferers, but were always ready to indulge in it when the preponderance of power lay upon their side.‚ÄúAmong Ibrahim‚Äôs people, there was a black named Ibrahimawa. This fellow was a native of Bornu, and had been taken when a boy of twelve years old and sold at Constantinople; he formerly belonged to Mehemet Ali Pasha; he had been to London and Paris, and during the Crimean war he was at Kertch. Altogether he was a great traveller, and he had a natural taste for geography and botany, that marked him as a wonderful exception to the average of the party. He had run away from his master in Egypt, and had been vagabondizing about in Khartoum in handsome clothes, negro-like, persuading himself that the public admired him, and thought that he was a Bey. Having soon run through his money, he had engaged himself to Koorshid Aga to serve in his White Nile expedition.‚ÄúHe was an excellent example of the natural instincts of the negro remaining intact under all circumstances. Although remarkably superior to his associates, his small stock of knowledge was combined with such an exaggerated conceit, that he was to me a perpetual source of amusement, while he was positively hated by his comrades, both by Arabs and blacks, for his overbearing behaviour. Having seen many countries, he was excessively fond of recounting his adventures, all of which had so strong a colouring of the ‚ÄúArabian Nights,‚Äù that he might have been the original ‚ÄúSinbad the Sailor.‚Äù His natural talent for geography was really extraordinary; he would frequently pay me a visit, and spend hours in drawing maps with a stick upon the sand, of the countries he had visited, and especially of the Mediterranean, and the course from Egypt and Constantinople to England. Unfortunately, some long story was attached to every principal point of the voyage. The descriptions most interesting to me were those connected with the west bank of the White Nile, as he had served some years with the trading party, and had penetrated through the Makkarika, a cannibal tribe, to about two hundred miles west of Gondokoro. Both he and many of Ibrahim‚Äôs party had been frequent witnesses to acts of cannibalism, during their residence among the Makkarikas. They described these cannibals as remarkably good people, but possessing a peculiar taste for dogs and human flesh. They accompanied the trading party in their razzias, and invariably ate the bodies of the slain. The traders complained that they were bad associates, as they insisted upon killing and eating the children which the party wished to secure as slaves: their custom was to catch a child by its ankles, and to dash its head against the ground; thus killed, they opened the abdomen, extracted the stomach and intestines, and tying the two ankles to the neck they carried the body by slinging it over the shoulder, and thus returned to camp, where they divided it by quartering, and boiled it in a large pot. Another man in my own service had been a witness to a horrible act of cannibalism at Gondokoro.‚ÄúThe traders had arrived with their ivory from the West, together with a great number of slaves; the porters who carried the ivory being Makkarikas. One of the slave girls attempted to escape, and her proprietor immediately fired at her with his musket, and she fell wounded; the ball had struck her in the side. The girl was remarkably fat, and from the wound, a large lump of yellow fat exuded. No sooner had she fallen, than the Makkarikas rushed upon her in a crowd, and seizing the fat, they tore it from the wound in handfuls, the girl being still alive, while the crowd were quarrelling for the disgusting prize. Others killed her with a lance, and at once divided her by cutting off the head, and splitting the body with their lances, used as knives, cutting longitudinally from between the legs along the spine to the neck.‚ÄúMany slave women and their children who witnessed this scene, rushed panic-stricken from the spot and took refuge in the trees. The Makkarikas seeing them in flight, were excited to give chase, and pulling the children from their refuge among the branches, they killed several, and in a short time a great feast was prepared for the whole party. My man, Mahommed, who was an eyewitness, declared that he could not eat his dinner for three days, so great was his disgust at this horrible feast.‚Äù‚Äì Sir Samuel W. Baker, ‚ÄúThe Albert N‚Äôyanza.

                            Thank you. To add perspective on Orwell, 1984 was originally titled 1949 and his name (before becoming a journalist and wartime propagandist) was originally Eric Blaire.
