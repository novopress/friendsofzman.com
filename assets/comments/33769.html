        Imagine drones being used for good, to better humanity like searching for unpermitted chicken coops and then hammering the lower middle class owners with fines.

            Can’t be more than a few years before Sheriff Smoldik Roscoe and his diversity deputy L’Shelle are telling residents of Pine Fork Bluff Anytown USA that the 9-man PD will need a fleet of 50 drones next year, no questions asked, Gus.

            In my city (pop 250,000), I phoned in a complaint about a “POD” that was being used as additional storage on my very narrow, minimal parking street.
“Tap tap tap…yeah, I can see it’s been there a few months.  Call this number and the city will take care of it”.
I’ve no idea what he was looking at on the other end of the line at his computer screen.  But my general impression was before/after drone and/or routine aerial surveillance taking photo sweeps.

                No doubt the Zombie National Review soon will make The Conservative Case for Liquidating Zoning Code Violators. Drones are very much part of the police state apparatus that runs this country even now.

                Interesting anecdote. This may explain why the China balloon and NJ drone stories became a sensation. You hype up the China menace. Check! You set the stage for normalizing constant drone surveillance to safeguard against China and other terrorist threats. Check!
Reading this comment section of people who seem up on the latest in military tech and it seems that Ellysium was a premonition where they consulted SV and the MIC.

                I’veread that insurance companies have been using drones (to assess the condition of a roof or ‘clutter’ in a yard) to then cancel home owner’s insurance – at least in Florida and California.  People complain, but I have not heard of a law suit trying to ban this on constitutional grounds.  Hint:  When in doubt, do not put your trust in ‘constitutional rights.’

                    Hell, in my County, the County itself takes aerials of your property and the boundaries of the plat map can be superimposed to specifically define just who is who.  They do this to check for additional property “improvements”.  This is available to all.
My insurance company pulled it down to assess the condition of my roof for insurance purposes last year.  When I took a look years ago, I saw that the plane filming caught me in the yard.  I’m now famous (I guess).

                        We almost never have any overflights or contrailshere (to the point that when we hear any engine, husband and I wonder what/who it is and go looking).  On the google maps satellite view, you cannot see our cabin for all the trees.  There were a couple of days last week when there were some loud helicopter flights in the area – I’m assuming because of the incoming weather – but I can’t identify one helicopter from another, so who knows.

                Yep.  The one saving Grace may lie in the public’s revulsion of such.  In my State this worked in the aspect of “red light cameras”.  These were banned Statewide.  However, the companies that market and run such continue to buy off legislators and the aspect of reinstatement comes up frequently.  The solution is to take out the monetary incentive for the camera’s use.  That of course evades the typical pol’s we put in office.On the other hand, technology advances in new cars can make possible self reporting for driving infractions, such as speeding. Insurance companies now offer discounts for allowing such information to be recorded and sent to them for analysis.  It’s a “Brave New World” as they say.  I’ll have little regret in leaving it soon.

            Yeah, one ongoing thing I harp on, on local pages, is how local Democrats were more than happy to fleece us through traffic cameras so long as they were getting bribes under the table from Redflex. And the dumb Democrats happy with their subsistence living on the plantation won’t ever hold them to account.

            Correct.
The short film, “Slaughterbots,” is completely wrong that AI drone swarms will be used to go after the spawn of Cloud People undergoing communist indoctrination at university.

            Why the hell are there any washing machines with computer chips in them?  It’s a terrible environment for chips and an easy point of failure.  I think LG has a washing machine with wifi and remote control of the washing machine via this wifi and a phone app.  WHY?  What purpose could this possibly serve given it’s a washing machine that you have to physically visit in order to put clothes in it!  It’s just another spying machine.  I remotely monitor my fully analog washing machine with a new invention called my ears.Despite being a lifelong lover of tech, particularly computer tech, they are turning me into a Luddite.  Tech for tech’s sake is usually terrible.  Look at what they have done to cars!  All of it to save 100 dollars in physical buttons, door handles and real gauges.

                Any home appliance with a board and chips in it is utimately useless.  We wasted a LOT of money replacing the burned-out board in my GE dual fuel (gas burners and electric oven) stove – twice – because it could not withstand the heat from the self cleaning option.  Now I have a simple, older gas stove that runs on propane.  Wish I had more space and could better adjust the burner flames, but it has no chips.  Also, never buy a fridge with the ice maker in the fridge section (i.e. freezer on bottom but ice maker in the top.  Wasted moneyreplacingthat too.

                You are right to be suspicious.  In some cases, the “reason” isblithelyrevealed.  Our electric power company once offered to replace our a/c thermostats with the new “NEST” model(s).  The catch being they would remotely control them during power events, like brown outs.  In short they reserved the “right” to turn your heat down or your a/c up when they thought it necessary to preserve the “grid”.  My suspicion is that such actions are being considered for other electronic appliances you once thought you “owned”.  What could go wrong?BTW: I bought Ecobee’s and programmed them myself.  Best couple of hundred bucks I’ve spent—but I kept the old “stupid” thermostats just in case.  Screw the electric company.

                    They may start out justifying this as a way to prevent power outages but you know that soon enough the “climate” will be added as a reason to screw around with your thermostat. This is one of the many ways “climate change” hysteria pays off. Our dusky replacements don’t care about it but the remaining younger Whites in many places are so climate cucked that they will put up with almost any invasion of privacy or curtailment of rights in the name of climate change. I’m sure half the homes in affluent White neighborhoods here in Oregon have, or will soon have, something like this.Power companies are apparently a stronghold of totalitarian thinking. Here in Oregon, PGE shut down the power in many rural areas when it was dry and windy because of the supposed danger that the wind would blow down power lines and start fires. Of course, most rural homes also need power to run water pumps to, you know, fight fires. I looked up the stats on this and found that, of course, wind-downed power lines are not a significant source of fires. Yet another case of idiots (probably innumerate wammen) creating chaos by trying to avoid every tiny risk. I’m still furious about this.

                            It may have been but no one who supported or opposed the Oregon power cuts mentioned this. The supporters were the usual Karens making the usual idiotic “safety first” arguments they used to justify masks and lockdowns. Mostly these were suburbanites whose power was never cut, while those opposed most fiercely were, of course, people in the rural areas they had blacked-out.

You should go to YouTube and search for teardown videos that compare 80s era washing machines to those from the modern day.
They are very instructive. It becomes apparent the older machines were more robust in key areas. There was also some ingenious engineering going on back then.

                    The Chinese have perfected the art of building something just well enough that it will function OK for a couple or few years.  Most people are not time oriented enough (and lack the data anyway) to ignore the tag price and use a cost per year method to assess relative prices.  This bad quality but low cost system drove out better quality, but higher priced system.  This is before even taking all of the fraud in china into consideration.I watched a video series on youtube about a guy designing and building a water wheel to generate electricity for his customer.  Once it was finished, after a few months the generator was doing all kinds of stuff it shouldn’t do.  It turns out, the Chinese supplier had simply re-labeled a 500 watt generator head and called it a 2500 watt generator head.  Anyone who has ever bought something off of alibaba or temo knows how infamous the Chinese are for this crap.  This is the fraud that permeates every aspect of life in China.  The food system is so rotten that the CCP has private farms to supply food for party members.  Look up gutter oil.

Took eons to heat the water (instead of relying on heated tap water) and tiny tub that couldn’t be used for blankets.  And then one needed a separate spin dryer.   I LOVE my all-American top-loading Speed Queen.

                    Unfortunately, the (European) machines you decry are the best they can have over there.  The “poz’d” runs very deep in Europe.  You pay four times the amount for electricity and have no natural gas and pretty soon you think these appliances are pretty good.  Sigh….

        One corollary to all this is that the US can pummel third-world foes but can’t project power against first-world adversaries. Another is that Russia could never take over the rest of Europe with conventional (non-nuclear) weapons. A third is that Israel probably let Hamas attack them on Oct 7th so they could have the excuse to level Gaza. Israel is expert at drone and electronic warfare. I refuse to believe the BS story that they were “surprised”. There really is no “element of surprise” anymore in modern warfare with drones and satellite overwatch. So the fourth is that the Russians probably allowed the Kursk incursion to trap the Ukes and rally their public, who were getting tired of the war.

            The usual rejoinder is that “muh airplanes beat your airplanes!”  Our Air Force is the biggest, the Navy is the second biggest,and the Marines are third biggest air forces on the planet.
Didn’t Russia demonstrate last year it can take out, say, Ramstein AFT in Germany using a Iskander with a non-nuclear payload that can target anything sitting around on the ground?
Modern war with a peer competitor is completely non-winnable.  It either ends in nukes or it never starts in the first place.

                I disagree.  Heaven forbid we go to war with China and it will be demonstrated.  Size matters.  We likely still have a technological edge against China, but that would be overwhelmed with sheer numbers and our inability to replace losses in a time frame relative to a war.

                        There’s a question of what purpose would be such war? In this commerce-dominated day and age it’s a simple calculation of potential losses that makes a good deterrent. It’s no longer a world of massively populated industrial quasi-autarkies.

                            Few wars ever seemed like a good idea after the fact.  Yet, war is still alive and well.  If the libertarians and democrats (by which I mean people who support democracy) were right, there would be no war in Ukraine.  Plenty of goods crossed the Ukraine-Russian border and both have democratically elected governments as flawed as their democracies allegedly are.Wars generally take longer than anyone expected before the war. They cost more money and lives than anyon expected before the war.  Finally, they accomplish less than anyone expected before the war, even when you win.  Yet, people keep fighting them.  It’s our nature.What would be the purpose of a war between China and The US?  Who knows.  They’ll invent a reason.  Once the ships start getting sunk and body bags start returning to America, it will be too late.

                    If you believe that surface units will exist and play a role in future peer-to-peer naval warfare (its an open question), China has at least naval nine shipyards that can produce carriers and each can do one a year. We have one shipyard, and it takes nine years to produce one carrier.Everyone is focused on how difficult it would be to sink a Nimitz or Ford class carrier, but repair of the extremely high tech launching and recovery systems after battle damage is a much bigger problem.The Japanese had to sink the Lexington or the Yorktown to put them out of action, because simple analog systems on deck along with pilot eyeballs were all that was necessary for combat operations.Look at a video on YouTube from Growler Jams showing modern launch and recovery operations, and how much real time integrated electronics are necessary to launch and recover the high tech warplanes. One hit to those syetems, or maybe even standoff drones jamming the signals, and the carrier can sail on in peace, because combat ops will be impossible.

                The airplanes became aerial weapon delivery systems. Furthermore, the big airfield base model with airplanes sensitive to dust became unsustainable and inefficient in the context of land warfare in the Eurasian space. Some old fans are still working themselves up over a vision of NATO airforce beating Russians to the curb, but this has simply become obsolete with the technological and conceptual developments in air defense. The kind of targets those weapon systems were designed to destroy are going to be more dispersed to mitigate the damage from drones. They could still be useful in destroying the radars and mobile launchers deep inside enemy territory, hence the focus on stealth capability.There is still no answer what to do with it in the naval theatre of course. It seems that the warplane won’t change its role in the fleet in the nearest future.

                There was a Jewish woman beheaded by Hamas who had been one of the festival go’ers. She was childless unmarried at 31 and living in Berlin working as a tattoo artist, living the Bohemian go-girl life, merely visiting Israel to do drugs and party.The Zionist point of view is that she was useless. She contributed nothing at all to their homeland, certainly not the thing that matters most: children. The manner of her death was used as a propaganda point, because that’s all the utility she had to offer. She and the rest of the useless druggie dumbshits were left out there as bait, as sure as rain.Is this harsh? Is it unfair? It is insight into the mind of nationalists determined to see their nations survive. It reminds me of the first time I saw the video of Benjamin Netanyahu’s West Bank settlement interview (everyone speaking with New Jersey accents) where he spoke his famous words “America is a thing easily moved.”I was greatly angered. Later I realized how stupid it was to be angry at someone for telling you the truth. America IS a thing easily moved, because we have a merchant-whore clown-trash administrative class directed by a ruling class comprised of ethnoreligious enemies who want us dead and replaced. Hate someone for being an enemy who is trying to enslave or destroy you, but don’t hate them for telling you the truth about yourselves. We should always be learning, especially from successful enemies.

        Excellent post. The second battle of Kursk may, in time, be seen as more significant than the first. The Ukrainians and the Neocons did not expect the plodding Russians to be able to adapt to this new age of war, which explains why they believed, not entirely unreasonably, that they would win. Stalemate would eventually lead to Putin’s fall, and they could have replaced him with Navalny, or whoever.  Then it’s back to the Yeltsin days of free shit for the Khazars.
Unfortunately for them, this is not your grandfather’s Russia.

That’s one reason I don’t despair for the lack of this weapon in the US arsenal.  The simplicity of the system and the readiness of response/alteration/improvement as shown by the Russians.  We can do the same,  IFF we do not let the MIC drive the spec’s out of all reality.  Good enough, is good enough.  Make them cheap, make them plentiful.  The Russians (and Iranians, and Turk’s) have shown the way.

                Given the fact that the MIC is used as an all-around jobs and welfare (both personal and corporate) program in the US I rather doubt our ability to produce cost effective drones in quantity. Z was talking this past weekend about how much globalist and free trade dogma controls US policy. Part of the reason for America’s militarism is that the MIC is used as a convenient way to achieve what other nations do through tariffs and nationalist subsidies for native industries. We need to outsource production of everything to cheaper places – except anything connected with “national security”. We have to make that stuff here. It’s a good way to work around what would otherwise be a crippling ideological straitjacket. It’s just another way the US resembles the dying Soviet Union. Even well meaning people who know what needs to be done can’t do it because the system is bogged down in inflexible ideology.

        This is why we’re getting to the point where no country, big or small will be able to project  military power (other than nuclear) much beyond their border regions.  Movement of large number of troops across oceans would be impossible and naval assets would be under constant drone attack.  Whatever drones the houthies are using are probably basic at best, but if the US stupidly attacks Iran, all bets are off.  One would think the US military has figured this out, but who knows.  What we should be doing is droning the hell out of the beaner cartels and maybe a rogue district judge or two…

            Drones don’t have the range to fly across oceans (yet anyway). They need platforms to carry them (sort of like aircraft carriers) if they are to threaten a blue water navy. But they can make brown water navies not just obsolete but non existent. So that the USN (for instance) could only project power 3/4 of the way across the ocean, rather than all the way across, to a place like Taiwan. It could no longer enter an enclosed body of water like, say, the Persian Gulf. We’ve already seen the Russian navy more or less abandon the Black Sea for this reason.

                Ultimately a drone is just any aircraft that can be piloted remotely or autonomously. There’s no technical reason you can’t do that with a C17 … or a B-52.

In fact, after the 2020 election when Bracken called on the InfoWars audience to load up, occupy DC, and storm the Capitol—what an odd thing to say!—no one came.

                Correct. Further and at best, guns drive up the costs of blue-clad thugs and lower their quality due to an off-chance of death or injury. A good argument can be made that private firearm ownership has bred unwarranted complacency. I prefer to live in a nation that allows private gun ownership, to be clear, but also realize a government that has no problem incinerating troublesome women and children in a Seventh-day Adventist compound will do things even the most depraved and trigger-happy individual cannot imagine.

        The next development in drones, which a few countries probably already have, are Ai directed drones.They won’t need to communicate with an operator or use external GPS. They will be given a mission to seek and destroy pre-programmed targets, including individual soldiers.So they won’t be jammable and will learn in real time to find new targets on the fly as the battlefield conditions change.Taken to a higher level, drones will eventually be able to detect friend from foe with zero errors and even target individuals by race, sex or their specific face.Until a credible anti-drone technology is developed, it’s hard to imagine large armies meeting in the field again.

Sounds sci-fi crazy, but we’re now at the stage where human beings have individualized bullets called drones that can fly hundreds of miles to stalk and kill a particular enemy. Who would’ve thought.

            It’s been a priority for a while now.it’s always a competition.Drones are the current game changer. It’s been closely watched in this latest hassle &amp; many experimental countermeasures are being fielded.Only the dead have seen an end to war.

        I have the opinion these days that the Jews are pretty bloodthirsty people. The Russians seem to value the lives of their people and have some fairly harsh memories of losing loved ones during the turmoil of the 20th century. The Jews seem to be cavalier about spilling the blood of non-Jews to accomplish their ends.Makes me wonder if all the propaganda we heard about Stalin, the Soviet Union and their bloodthirstiness wasn’t also driven by the behavior of the small hats within the Soviet power structure.

            Pre-Stalin: entirely. Stalin era: decreasingly. I don’t think he intended that.He’s often accused of being antisemitic. The case for it is mostly gossip, like our media’s stories about Trump praising Hitler backstage. Stalin thought the “doctors’ plot” was nonsense, “rootless cosmopolitans” wasn’t his phrase (and to him “cosmopolitanism” was a term of art that meant something like “fascism”), and the story of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, which his regime both formed and destroyed, is an incomprehensible exhibition of competitive lying.When I was a kid and there were still some straight-up Soviet communists around, the Jewish ones often condemned “korenizatsiia”—Stalin’s proto-anti-whiteness, what became Russian boomer brain (e.g., Putin’s)—as antisemitic. Itwasan anti-Zionism, as Zionism is the “bourgeois nationalism”par excellence,contrary to the idea of the non-Great non-Russian empire.Anyway, the list of Russian bad guys doesn’t read like a random page from a Russian phone book, of course. It wasn’t their revolution.

        Drones are a game-changer in military affairs, but it doesn’t stop there. Lethal hunter-killer drones can be manufactured in a garage and equipped with a $30 Raspberry Pi CPU that enables AI-driven visual recognition and autonomous targeting control. They can be pre-positioned anywhere and lie in wait until remotely activated by a surveillance drone or other command signal. Static minefields are now obsolete and being replaced by active pursuit drone fields. Soon bio-soldiers will also become obsolete at the front and it will become drone versus drone warfare. Them EMP weaponry will step up to kill everything electronic on the battlefield. Innovation is now moving at lightspeed.

            Thus, it doesn’t pay to throw away that $4000 customized rifle …. Ultimately, it always “becomes” again about people on people.  Just have to wait until next technology swing comes around again. Just like all the goofy SOBs who thought since Trump was elected (or, yes, in prior elections where Rs were returned to power too), that it was ok now to sell off the AR and ammo they’d squirreled away. You never know ….
Bows, crossbows, knives, even garrotes and sticks, too will always have their place in human affairs.

        Can the US manufacture drones entirely of American made parts?  My guess is no we cannot.
OTOH, it is likely countermeasures will make the drone revolution  less important in the future.  Already a lot of these drones are no longer radio controlled because radio is too easily jammed.  A lot of them now have fiber optic spools as a workaround to jamming.

                Can we make washing machine chips?  It seems less likely we can make low end chips than high end chips.  The US is plagued by high costs making low cost products impossible to manufacture in the US.  We can build 10 million dollar CNC machines, we just cannot make a TV or a transistor radio or a 3d printer or something.  High end stuff is much less sensitive to price than low end stuff.

        The comparisons to WW1 continue.  Even if an army makes a stunning and successful surprise attack [the 1918 Spring Offensives or the Gas Tunnel Attack], it can’t be fully exploited because the defense is too strong due to technology.
It’s a war of attrition.
So, for the hundredth time:  Ukraine cannot defeat Russia.  Give up, already.

        I don’t think the nature of war has changed. To paraphrase Clausewitz, war has a political and human part and is a contest of wills conducted through uncertainty. This has been continuous throughout warfare’s history, despite advances in technology. The character of war does and has changed. Although I think that the influence of drones has been massive and has changed the character of war, I also think they are primarily dangerous as a means of relaying targeting information and not just as hunter/killers.

        There is a self-limiting principle to this which is not unlike nuclear weapons.  They take certain geopolitical strategies off the table.  Wars to depose people we don’t like, followed by nation building?  Off the table.  Far too easy and inexpensive to deploy drone countermeasures.  Inability to project ground troops to gain and hold territory.It’s like taking away all the armor, fortifications, and standoff weapons away from both sides, then telling them to stand in the middle of an open field where they can be easily seen.  War has always depended on stealth and surprise, and the ability to mass forces.  None of that is possible today.It does make terrorism a more optimal strategy.  But that, too, has diminishing returns.  Terrorism to achieve…what?  The only really useful terrorism these days is nation states attacking their own (non-drone-armed) citizenry.  That will be exploited, of course, but wars between nation states become far less likely.  The risks are too high.It’s not like it would be terribly hard to take down AF-1 for example.  That drone attack on Moscow was timed for AFTER Witkoff’s plane left the other day.  Why?  To avoid taking out his aircraft with either the drones or the resulting AAA.War with China is looking like a catastrophic endeavor for the US.  So why engage in it?  Send a billion drones to Taiwan as a deterrent and call it good.  Drone subs will destroy their invading fleet/landing craft.  The Chinese mainland would be easily struck.  No need to send carriers in there to get sunk.While it would be a stretch to say we’re moving into a post-war geopolitical world, it is not a huge stretch.  That’s why Trump’s basic foreign policy is economic.  Trade deals.  Tariffs.  Wars of conquest are becoming increasingly impossible.  A country of 150M people cannot overcome a nation of 50M people that is ON ITS BORDER.War will never cease, but it is increasingly becoming obsolete as a means to achieve political goals (break out your Clausewitz, kids).  War is an extension of politics by other means.  Well, there are other, less costly, means these days as the war of attritions kill millions and accomplish basically nothing.Large militaries – largely robots – will mainly serve as nuclear deterrents.  Remember, these are just drones flying around.  The robot ground troops haven’t shown up yet.  The ones that have no conscience, feel no pain or remorse, and can carry more weapons and do not require food.Star Trek TOS “A Taste of Armageddon” shows one possible outcome.  In that episode, the two planets just launch AI attacks on each other, and any of the simulated dead have to report to disintegration chambers.  It’s madness, but that’s what you’re left with once you fully automate war.  It’s just a big episode of Battle Bots.  What would be the point of this from a geopolitical perspective?  There is none.

            Sooner or later, someone will convince themselves they can win a nuclear war. Or else not care about the consequences of losing one. It might take another 50 or 100 or 500 years, but as long as nukes continue to exist, it is a virtual certainty that eventually this happens. Sooner or later.

                I guess that’s my point, though.  Russia, a country with 150M people, couldn’t defeat a country with 50M, despite a shared border, unmolested logistics supply lines, and air superiority.  The home team couldn’t repel said invasion despite almost a trillion dollars in aid and weapons.And both sides learned that external stakeholders were more than happy for their own benefit to help Ukraine and Russia kill each other by the bushel.As much as China possesses massive manpower/weaponry advantages over Taiwan, like Russia does over Ukraine, I’m sure they’re looking at Ukraine and wondering if it is worth losing Shanghai or Hong Kong in a conflict.  Taiwan will not be limited from striking the Chinese mainland like Ukraine was prevented (mostly) from attacking Russia.  And the drone factor has the potential to eliminate their manpower/weaponry advantages.  You can bet we’ve already tested drone mines and drone subs to place in Taiwan Straits that can autonomously perform hunter-killer missions.Russia can feed itself.  China cannot.  A China isolated from fuels and foods begins to starve to death in months.  Can they keep the US Navy out of the Taiwan Straits?  Yep.  Can they do anything about the US Navy seizing fuel tankers out of the Middle East and the USA cutting off vital food supplies?  Nope.There’s always the Madman Scenario.  But that’s becoming less and less possible.

        The advent of a Technical in the Middle East was the first sign of technology becoming the equalizer, along with cellphone-triggered IEDs. As soon as the internal combustion engine became a basic global commodity it bridged a major gap between the great powers and non-state actors, by granting previously inaccessible mobility to the latter. The cellular network and the Internet did the same for communication.It is often forgotten that while the Empires are major catalysts for technological breakthroughs, they are also their foremost spreaders which nullifies the early-adopter advantages in shorter periods of time.Right now it appears that the Drone is an item to center next battle-doctrines around, but it can’t be forgotten that this war has also disproven various future-war theories that started circling around at the height of American adventurism across the globe.Generating reserves is back on the menu and the spec-ops oriented armies are sent to the dustbin. It turns out that the Cold War mobilization systems were dismantled prematurely and the current fighting forces are designed to withstand a week or two of sustained fighting. Operational focus on army brigades is also being called into question. Even the individual equipment has to be overhauled because what worked for chasing Mohammad in the hot desert can’t withstand the daily encounters with good ol’ shrapnel. The modern soldier is also overburdened with extra-stuff he should not lug around in the trenches or in an assault. Superior firepower through “dumb” shells still carries weight and even though the heavy armor is now restricted in operation, it’s still important to have some moving cover and support. Reinforced concrete blocks became natural fortress points despite the assertions that fancy rockets and guided bombs were supposed to invalidate them. Minefields are back in play with mobile long-range deployment systems that provided us the bulk of horror-videos of the failed counter-offensive.I disagree with the author that “Cheap drones are turning expensive, high-tech weapons into liabilities(…)”. It’s that the purpose of these weapons and place in the fighting doctrine is being changed. The Iskanders are now used more tactically, with local commanders being able to request their support. The HIMARS was likewise a good asset for Ukrainians limited by the industrial capacity of its supplier. What became a liability was the western focus on those pieces as “game-changers” which created an imbalanced and inadequate view of the future battlefield. Similarly I wouldn’t overstate the potential of drones. The machine gun invalidated the classic infantry charge in the Great War, but the tank soon countered it (itself becoming a prey for the AP shells). Eventually the drone will find its predator too.

        In one way, this is mine warfare on steroids – in terms of using them to force the enemy to move in a certain direction. Once big companies begin using drones as delivery vehicles – like Amazon – imagine being able to hack into those drones to utilize them for intelligence gathering purposes. You could expand your “eyes” ten-fold.

            It might be the case that drone warfare opens up new opportunities for airborne units, particularly using HALO techniques (not the game, lol). To my mind Airborne has never really lived up to its potential, but it’s too cool not to be good for something.

            If the simulation says “you lose and China’s the boss now” I don’t think the simulated outcome will be given much weight.  Partly because only a fool would trust it, partly because it would have to be offering a sort of  Monte Carlo simulation which would likely show some percentage where China doesn’t win and thereby gives hope of pulling off a win, but mostly because “fuck that I refuse to sccept it and I’m fighting anyway”.  And to the elite, normal people’s blood is pretty cheap.   Why go down without a fight?

        Seen in this light, the deployment of Euro troops to Ukraine becomes both less ridiculous and more pointless, simultaneously. They don’t need a lot of troops to influence the battlefield, they just need a lot of drones. Which begs the question of why bother at all sending what is sure to be merely a token number of troops? Just send drones.

        Now connect the drones not to ChatGPT, DeepSeek etc but to a much more powerful AI thats been in development for 20 years.

        The thing about drones is they’re cheap. A SAM (surface to air missile) is more expensive because of its component parts, and it only sees one use. A drone can be reusable. In the battlefield of tomorrow, cheap and numerous beats big and lumbering. The ultimate cheap and numerous is a virus. In Stephen King’s 1978 novel _The Stand_ a rogue bioweapon — “a constantly shifting flu” — gets out of the lab and infects the world population. 99.4 percent die off. It’s a good read — King’s best book — a reminder that among the panoply of war innovations we still haven’t got a firm hand on the rudder…— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

                    We know our nature pretty early in life and largely choose to ignore it. Developments such as drones simply make it harder to engage in such willful ignorance.

            It really makes me wonder what happens to the MIC. What is stopping GAE’s enemies from attacking an aircraft carrier with as many drones as necessary to sink it? Aircraft carriers cost $13B to make according to Google, cost $6M a DAY to operate, and have a staff of 5000 people. The government put a serious amount of time and investment in all those people. Drones cost a few thousand bucks and have a guy sitting in a room operating it (maybe). It’s just not a far fight.Of course, nothing really is going to change until the GAE’s military gets blown out on the field of battle.

                Your average small battlefield drone, as seen in Ukraine, can’t carry enough ordnance to do much to a carrier. And they don’t have much range. It takes larger drones with more range, which are more expensive, and which are easier to intercept than the smaller ones. The farther out to sea the carrier is, the less vulnerable. Of course their mere existence diminishes the power of the carrier, which now must stand off at a greater distance.

                    Well, one, obviously, but what about 5,000? How many is needed to do real damage? Whatever it is, it’s a fraction of what the aircraft carrier costs. I know someone at Rand has done this math.
Even now, the US is spending billions of dollars to attack a bunch of guys who live in tents and fire rockets and use cheap drones against Israeli shipping vessels. Yes the USA can print the money and spend the resources but this imbalance is crazy and the guys living in tents can do far more damage than they could at any other time.

                        Why 5000 of anything?  The hypersonic missile technology—already proven—can take out a carrier well away from their attack range.  What Russia demonstrated was simply a short range use of a fairly long range weapon.  It only takes one as this weapon carries 36 war heads—yep it’s a MIRV.

                        Depends who you are and at what stage in the game you’re at. Given likely insane go full nuke reaction of the US to losing a carrier to ship killer missile, a drone swarm attack knocking out the CATOBAR components might be more appealing to a peer with infrastructure and population centres they’re apt to feel sentimental about.
