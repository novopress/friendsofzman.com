        Im not sure it follows that because some bad press was good for some businesses that it wouldn’t hurt others. I just dont think companies would spend so much on advertizing and have psychologists on staff at marketing firms if it didnt work. We can say to ourselves “advertising doesn’t work on me” but it must or these companies wouldn’t do it.
I think Guinness spent 20 million on a superbowl ad. I just dont see them spending so much if most people knew it may or may not work. Its subconcious. Like the antiwhite stuff on tv

            Corporations are no more expert at rational profit-seeking than governments are at preserving life, liberty, etc.
Neither is remotely “fit for purpose.”
Libertarianism is the mindkiller.

            Perhaps you misunderstand. Spending that kind of money on a Super Bowl ad can be compared to the reason Guinness’s parent conglomerate spends millions on a shiny corporate headquarters which no consumer will ever visit and hundreds of thousands printing glossy, artistic annual reports almost no consumers will ever see. It’s to show you are at the top.

        Reminds me when I ran marketing for a big consumer electronics brand.  Agency shows me their mockups and ad concepts, blacks and Asians everywhere.Me: “Did you read the brief on who our target market is (white male, 50+, high income)?”Agency: “Yes.”Me: “Then why am I not seeing my target market in these ads?”Agency: “We wanted to help you reach new people and expand your market!”Me: “That’s not what I asked for. Redo the ads with the target market defined in the brief”They did.  All along, they didn’t really care to expand the market — that was just rationalization.  No, instead they cared more about the circle jerk of approval from their peers within their agency and the larger creative world. What’s fashionable? What will me friends and colleagues think is cool?  Ergo, less white and more vibrancy.  It’s how we get 50% black drivers in a Ram pickup ad.Problem is, most marketing execs don’t have the guts to tell the agency to change the demographics back to white.  And too many are co-conspirators in their anti-whiteness with the same motives — protect and enhance their social standing amongst their peers.  Especially the white female marketers who demonstrate suicidal outgroup preference.

            A good part of the reason I haven’t bought any electronics since 2012 is that all the “tech” advertising is always just a bunch of the kinds of women I swipe left on, along with the obligate 90 lb homosexual black man wearing a salmon-colored suit with an ascot and stupid glasses.  The rare times it’s a white male he’s the balding soyjack mouth gape brought to life.

            “That’s not what I asked for. Redo the ads with the target market defined in the brief”I don’t know when your tenure was, but were you putting your job in danger by giving that order?  Your order is a pretty clear signal that you are not on the right side of history.As a programmer, I avoided a lot of the mandatory diversity training, but I got it annually at my last job.  Even though my employer was somewhat conservative, and located in a red state, if I would made a good-natured joke in those trainings, there might have been consequences.“Sexual harassment training?  I’m already pretty good at it!”

        What really did in the DeSantis campaign was the average Republican voter’s unshakeable infatuation with Trump. Infatuation: from the Latin “fatuus” (foolish).

            Had DeSantis run his own version of Ramaswamy’s campaign, he would now be poised to take the nomination when they frog march Trump off to prison. That may have even been his original intention when he referred to the Ukraine war as a “territorial dispute”. His donors freaked out, of course, and DeSantis has never recovered from the flip flop.
That is why our side can never trust anyone who isn’t already rich. By itself wealth may not be sufficient to resist corruption, but it is necessary.

            I’ve been asking anti-Trumpers since early 2016, “Okay, who you got?” The answers have so far been one sad sack after another.
So, who’ve you got? I need a named human being. “Not Trump” is not specific enough.

                It’s so funny to watch the normie conservative sites like NRO or HotAir try to whip up enthusiasm for Haley.  I wonder if they have nervous flashbacks to their enthusiasm for !Jeb! or McCain.
One of the few reasons for optimism is there seem to enough GOP voters who won’t vote for a globalist to frustrate the plans of the GOP establishment.

            What did DeSantis for me was his responses just after he announced to questions about the Ukraine fiasco. I forget what he said, exactly, but it was a determined refusal to answer the question. ~”I support our soldiers” or ~”Our military needs to be less woke” or some such stupid irrelevant shit. It reminded me of Trump’s switching from “They all must go!” to endorsing Pence’s touchback amnesty plan within a week or so of his coming down the escalator. He was clearly never going to be — and DeSantils is never going to be — anything better than a hold-your-nose-and-vote-for-the-lesser-evil candidate.

                    Try again, then. I’m not going to give the WaPo mopey to get behind its paywall. Why are you doing that?I have no idea what “DA” means, but if your point is that DeSantis HAS some crap on his campaign website about Ukraine then I don’t doubt that he does. Who wrote it for him I don’t know. The stuff on Trump’s 2016 campaign website and was written by Jeff Sessions and bore no relation to either what Trump was saying when asked or what he actually did, which was make love to “dreamers” and other stupid shit.DeSantis did what I said he did. I saw it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears. .

        I find that commercials pretty much always put me off their products and create a negative association with the brand.In a personal sense it’s positive. Every time I see a McDonald’s, Popeyes, Burger King, or Tim Hortons commercial it reminds me that I am boycotting them. When I get a McDonald’s craving, I remember “yeah, but they featured that mixed race couple” and reach for an apple instead. Some products you need and have limited options, like banking, insurance, smartphones. What can you do. I don’t like their ads either.A bigger question – who are the ads targeted to?Are they actually targeted towards the growing POC groups in Western society? How many black people drive Dodge Rams? How many buy Subarus? How many buy home insurance? How many are even watching Monday Night Football? On top of this the black population isn’t even going up anyways. The numbers don’t add up.So that leaves us with 2 more options.1) the ads are actually targeted AT WHITE PEOPLE, in a positive way. White people feel good seeing more “minority” representation. Who feel morally righteous giving their money to a wise man of colour. Who are proud to have that black friend and reminded of how they are not racist by this product.2) the ads are targeted at white people in a NEGATIVE way. Basically, they are actually crafted to demoralize white people and confuse us. Nobody wants these ads yet they are made anyways. It’s a few marketing firms making all the ads, the execs are too afraid to speak up, everyone else is doing it, and regular people lack the mindset and/or willpower to do anything about it.It’s hard to know what normal white people think. Do they care? Some seem to have noticed, but many don’t seem to notice or care at all. Maybe they’re confused and don’t know what to do. Do normal black people support it? Do they want to be portrayed as a white man in every ad? Not sure that is what they want either.Young people mostly don’t even own TV’s and watch YouTube channels, podcasts, Netflix, etc., limiting ad exposure. Interestingly YouTube just banned ad blockers, so now everyone will be exposed to the commercials.We’ll see what happens. I’m hoping that these commercials lead to decreased brand loyalty and consumerism among some people, and maybe even push them away from mainstream society.

            Watching Youtube and streaming movies definitely does not reduce ad exposure. That’s the only way I know what’s in ads nowadays.

Doesn’t matter that such as above might limit ad exposure.  The product being sold *is* DIE.  Netflix produces its own media (as well as buys stuff).  If you see their logo on the show icon, you can be sure of getting a healthy dose of DIE.  I’ve commented on this before.  YouTube is not much different in that it censors most all anti-woke channels.

            I’ll let you in on a secret. To whom are ads aimed? To the people who pay for them.This isn’t a trivial distinction. Having been in the advertising business for many years, I’m most familiar with the creative side as opposed to the account management side or media buying. I can first assure everyone that art directors and copywriters very seldom discuss sales. In the thread below, Zman mentions that ads matter in terms of awareness. That’s much closer to what creatives ponder. All their ads are supposed to be little stories or vignettes that get your attention. It barely matters if what happens in an ad relates to the product at all. Just consider the celebrity testimonial.  The carny trash is onscreen to make you pay attention, nothing more.At any rate, whose attention really matters here?“A bigger question – who are the ads targeted to?”Creatives design ads to fulfill the “creative brief.”  That’s the document or direction issued by the client and top agency bosses which describes the objectives of a campaign. This is where I’m most familiar with the process. And what you see is both client and agency share the same globohomo priorities. In this they ape the usual corporate moral platitudes. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard variations on “the client wants to showcase their diversity” or “the client wants an aspirational approach.”  Not “let’s show why our widget is better than brand X” or “let’s give our customers more of what they like.”  No, they want to make you aware of how good *they* feel diversity is, or how *they* think a world featuring their widget looks glamorous and desirable. It’s not that they think “the public will eat this tranny shit up,” but rather “this is what good people want to see: smart sassy upper middle class blacks… and being good corporate citizens, we’ll give you lots of it.”Just as HR departments have developed a uniform culture across business, so has advertising.  The agency gives the client what he wants because he’s paying, and the client wants his public face to reflect all the current year pieties *to his corporate peers.*  People move jobs back and forth between ad agencies and the corporate departments that buy advertising.  This reinforces herd thinking. Perhaps another way to view it would be helpful.  Globohomo advertising is like keeping fresh paint and clean windows on your office building. It is expected of you and just looks better, especially to the boss and to your peers.

                Fascinating stuff, really. If you know: has it ever been empirically demonstrated that (a) such a campaign actually harmed a brand, and (b) if that has been illustrated, did it effect behavior? Based on you comment, my guess is it wouldn’t matter but I still have to wonder if a negative effect has been proven and then disregarded.

                    I really couldn’t say, however with respect to my above comment, I have never heard, ever, any conversations in advertising along the lines of “this thing really backfired so let’s do something else” or “the customer really hates X.”  I *have* heard “the client hates X.”  Remember the horizon for ad people is very shallow. What matters is: will your boss buy it, and then will his boss buy it too?  Then the client?  You never have to listen to a customer, even though ad agencies spend lots of money on focus groups. Those are like trim tabs on a plane. They can adjust the flight path but don’t determine the destination. Which is landing in the world of Magic Non-Whites.

            B125, don’t forget that you think critically. That sets you apart from most people…I’d say 15% at most, of any race, and mostly men, truly think critically about what’s put in front of them. The rest watch product and passively consume the commercials, or ignore them. To normie TV watcher, commercials are just part of the ritual or an excuse to use the bathroom or grab chips.Being a critical bastard has its downsides though. I’ll point something out that is plainly obvious to me…like Super Bowl halftime shows are a satanic display of degeneracy…and I get met with “dude what”.Just the other day, I was attending a football game (note: not because I wanted to, but because I am required to volunteer) for elementary schoolers, ELEMENTARY schoolers, and the stadium speakers were playing aggressive rap music to fill the play gaps. There were little kids everywhere, little white kids everywhere, and they were all passively consuming music product that’s designed to make you k-selected. It was dystopian. I brought this up to someone, and I got a “dude what” look. Though to be fair, I hadn’t been to a school football game in decades. I was like a Victorian time-traveller.

                It used to be that the mute button was sufficient to screen yourself from offensively inane commercials. No more. Now you either have to turn off the set or leave the room. If they can’t reach you through your ears, they’ll get to you through your eyes.As for the “music” at football games, yes it is horrendous. But what’s more gobsmacking than the diabilical filth they play is the fact that people–white people–sit still for it. If whites had any testicular fortitude left, they would not only boycott the games, they would burn down the stadiums. But that sort of righteous fury went out with the “civil rights movement,” dontchaknow.

        That billboard is an amazing find. The best part was the ad slogan underneath:
“We never drop the ball.”
Given how often marketing and the biz folks use cliches, I bet the firing said something like, “Jenny. You have been awesome, totally like awesome and like amazing and stuff while working for us. Unfortunately, you dropped the ball today and we really needed a touchdown. I’m sorry. We have to cut you from the team and keep our roster small this season.”

If the businesses can’t find workers, then why are more businesses needed?  Everyone has a job.
Its all about greed and MORE.  MORE.  MORE.

                    The new line from the Canadian government is that we need more immigrants so that we can build more houses for more immigrants.

        I think this article misses the social conditioning that ads can produce. For example, a new Iphone.  The function of the ads, however, is to whip the masses into a frenzy by encouraging them to think that this new phone is ontologically different from what came before. When I say ads, to be clear, I mean the whole media apparatus that puts the new Thing in front of the average sheeple’s face. This is impactful, and this does affect people.

            We could spend the next year discussing the social conditioning in ads, and who produces it and why. And who falls for it (women). I am pretty sure whatever product is ostensibly on display comes in a distant second to the social conditioning goal.

        That whole “Be less white” internal memo leaked from Coca Cola did not kill its market share. I don’t think it even made a dent, unlike the Bud Lite fiasco. Just goes to show who sits higher on the grievance totem pole.In my opinion, advertising in general produces more negative than positive outcomes. I can be neutral and indifferent to 95% of ads, but one that sticks in my craw for being irritating with sappy jingles, or is downright hostile to my demographic (looking atyou, Gillette) will only push me away from a company and its products. I can’t recall the last time I heard or saw an ad that positively induced me to choose one brand over another. But my list of personally boycotted brands is so long now that I need a scorecard to keep track.As for the ubiquitous blackety-blackness in every goddamned print ad (L.L. Bean?Really?!?) and commercial today, I think the impetus is manifold. Sure, companies want to build their black customer base (although holding the title of THE most looted beer or fashion label is probably not what they have in mind). They want to buildanycustomer base. And knowing all too well how race-conscious and sensitive that demographic is, they don’t wish to offend their potential black base with too many ofay YTs (especially White men) in flattering roles.On the other end of the spectrum, Whites, with their backs firmly to the wall, cannot risk seeming offended by the ubiquitous depiction of refined, upscale blacks in advertising, even when they are de facto cuckolded with miscegenous humiliation rammed down their throats. So, it is a ‘safe’ advertising ploy to ease White men out of the picture in favor of clean, articulate Obama types (for now). Gain black approval while risking little or nothing among the White monied class.What surprises me is that Hispanics really get short shrift, considering that this demographic is rocketing up the social scale in both sheer numbers and corresponding purchasing power. If I were a proud member of la raza I’d want to know where’s my knob-polishing?

            That’s changing. They haven’t been here long. The average border-jumping Mexican (or whatever) is white enough not to have a strong desire to be “represented.” Their children are real Americans and hate white people, because being American consists of that (and a cheese-flavored sauce).

        “Twitter is not reality, but an alternative reality with little impact on reality.”Z I must disagree with you there; it did impact reality.  Twitter (pre-Musk) provided the leftist echo chamber the MSM used to float and refine leftist dogma.  If the twitter feedback was that the reporter’s article wasn’t sufficiently progressive, the report apologized and went back and fixed it. The democrat party platform and the leftist dogma that influences almost every American institution was shaped by this iterative process.  It was the leftist hive in action.On Twitter all their uninformed ideas were fully accepted.  Who would not agree that the police were killing unarmed black men at an alarming rate; everyone (on twitter) knows it. Thanks to twitter and lazy reporters the MSM went further down the progressive rabbit hole.  The press is one of least trusted institutions in America. The MSM has learned nothing, and they continue to dig.

        As a speaking as a senior sales guy – I think I will disagree with you Z, but the usual  weasel words apply: I am a former senior sales guy, I set company sales records that still stand today; I concede I may be biased and admit I may be full a chit.There are very very few similarities between selling politics and selling pop. The products are nothing alike. The only similarity between them is that the guys that own the corporations also own our politicos.The most profitable and successful companies are those that are run by leaders who are themselves salesmen. They understand their own products, they understand how to make them appeal to their markets and they understand their competition and customers. Often they dictate the marketing strategy and the sales guys just do the leg work.You did a poast on this awhile back – how companies start small, grow, become stratified and ossified and the climbers and psychopaths boil off the competent and achievers are boiled off. Modern corporate America is no longer about building and innovating and achieving  – it’s about currying favour with the boss, stabbing your competitors in the back, and making deceit and treachery jobs skills to ensure your success. The cloud people that run our society are no psychopaths, liars, thieves and cheats – even murderers, if the conspiracies are to be believed. They are surrounded by yes-men, who themselves are served by swarms of other yes-men. Like it or not, Donald Trump is pretty much the only presence Old World America has in current politics. He knows his product, he knows his audience, he knows how to reach them. He knows how to hustle and pitch. Not to sing his praises or say he’s perfect; he is not the answer to America’s problems… but he IS a step in the right direction. Tell Donald Trump that marketing isn’t an effective tool.These debacles happen when MANAGEMENT isn’t doing its job. De Santis should have spotted Bill Mitchell for the flop he is. He literally got set on fire on Gab and run out of town on a rail. The horse faced woman and her trannie got hired because the management at Bud Lite thought the world was fake and gay. Much of it is, I suppose, but their customers weren’t part of it.Huckster marketers are no different than huckster managers. If your management is going to be fake and gay… your company will be too. The customers will see that and eventually they will react.

            I think you have to separate sales, marketing and advertising. Sales is making calls, following up on customer requests, etc. Good sales man work hard doing what has always worked in sales. Marketing is mostly bullshit. Advertising works in terms of awareness, but it mostly the product of marketing people.

        Tangential:  I was head of a team to look into Additive Manufacturing for our company.  The team was all technically oriented, so we quickly figured out it was a niche process with only a limited application to our business:  Slow, non-precision, too much thermal processing to hold tight tolerance, questionable material properties.  Yet professional journals kept hyping it as “Revolutionary!”  Every trade magazine had multiple articles about Additive Manufacturing.  Sometimes there were entire special issues about the process.  But it was mostly hype.I called it “the world’s slowest revolution”.  The hype didn’t change the reality of the technical limitations.FWIW we did buy a couple 3d printers for thermoplastics.  They have a niche, but hardly anything worth ten years of canned-heat marketing.

Indeed: Excellence sells itself: attracting new fans by the very fact of its excellence, with no need of outside assistance.

                Boo!
Scaredy-cat’s safe space has been invaded and his right to spout bullshit without getting embarrassed has been lost.
So sad for JerseyJeffersonian and his upvoters.
But, luckily you, there’s nothing here to hold my interest. Mostly an infestation of blowhard wanna-be Nazis with a collective IQ adding up to maybe 2 digits. Yecch.

        With the preface that electoral politics, at least on the national level, now are meaningless: any campaign that would hire either Bill Mitchell or Pedro Gonzales richly deserves to get its ass handed to it. Gov. DeSantis strikes me as a relatively intelligent individual, so these two and probably legions like them most likely were hired by Con, Inc., and he just rubberstamped it if he had any input at all. The biggest rap on DeSantis is that he cozied up at all with Con, Inc., at all since he knew it was a nest of vicious even if incompetent vipers.Endorsements, much like straight up marketing, is far more likely to do harm than to help. If Bud Light, for example, simply had dropped all advertising its market share probably would be the same today. I can’t say how much the Mitchells and Gonzales’ have hurt DeSantis but no doubt they have done damage. “First do no harm” should be the mantra for advertising campaigns, but in fact it often appears the goal is to “do harm first.”

        My HOA neighbors left an Amazon holiday catalog in the paper recycling. Thumbing through it about 80% of the pics are of black, excuse me, Black people. All looking quite middle class or above, one featured woman is deaf, and there’s one pic of a woman in a wheelchair. WTH are the marketing people behind this thinking?

                It’s a fantasy of white subjugation, for sure, but it’s also one where blacks just step in and inhabit the roles of the white people completely and totally and everything moves on exactly as it was before. It’s all very strange. Like, how many ads show black families camping? Did they ever read SWPL? Camping is one of those “weird white people things” according to blacks. The market for your rugged offroad SUV *disappears* if the demographics reflect your ads. But that’s not how they see it.

                        Not only do they step in and inhabit the roles of whites, many many times they also look like white people, only with dark skin. Especially  the black women in ads. They do not look like typical black women.

                They’re selling virtue-fantasy. All the advertising featuring completely unrealistic portrayals of Negroes and women is probably not intended to be specifically “anti-white,” nor is it intended to expand the Negro customer base.It’s aimed at affluent white people with the disposable income to buy whatever product is being pitched. But in turn, the religion of those affluent white people is anti-racism and gender equality and equality of sexual preference. In other words the advertising is intended to flatter the sense of moral superiority that the affluent white people have for believing in the racial and gender fantasies.If it’s “anti-white” in any real sense, it is only so because it offends the Trump-voting white truck driver making $25 an hour, who (with the exception of Bud Light) probably wouldn’t be buying their products anyway.

                        True. But the gist of the Negro-centric sales pitch remains thus: if a customer buys a product, she is morally superior to those benighted Trump rubes, even if it is a mundane product like toothpaste.She may not be rich — yet — but she aspires to be, and if one aspires to be part of the wealthy, important class one must subscribe to the racial, gender and sexual pieties thereof.It took me a while to figure this out. Negroes are only 13% of the population, and the least wealthy cohort at that. Clearly the advertisers are not trying to sell to that demographic — if they were, they’d be pitching Kools and fried chicken and malt liquor. But there is simply not that much money to be made from the Negro market.The Negrification of advertising is actually aimed at liberal whites.As is the case with everything else in our society, the Negroes (13%) and the Jews (&lt;2%) are only relevant insofar as the white population is divided, and the shitlib whites use them as pawns in their war against MAGA whites.

            Here in my town, the largest local charity sent me their seasonal Thanksgiving fund solicitation letter asking for donations to “feed the poor this holiday”.  The single picture of the “poor” (I assume to be fed) was a cute looking Black child.  This is a majority Hispanic town with Blacks being perhaps 3% of the population.  Hispanics have little love for the Blacks and of course Whites not much either—but better than the Hispanic population.

                I’ve noticed corporate ads on Messkin TV feature plenty of Hutus. Not as many as on mainstream TV, but still quite a few. The Power Structure is trying to cram negro worship down the throats of Messkins, too. I doubt it will work. The pachucos are not afflicted by pathological altruism, a guilty conscience and race-treason.

            I doubt the marketing people are *thinking* at all. They look around, see that pretty much *all* current ads are featuring prosperous successful blacks and smiling well-adjusted inter-racial couples, and proceed to do the same.
The fact of how rare these actually are in real life— or a consideration of how their audience will respond to them— likely never enters their hive minds.

                Disagree.  Not a single photo is chosen randomly.  There are numerous confirmations of the head of an ad campaign specifically ordering a mixed-race ‘family’ or a same-sex ‘couple.’  It is not merely accidental when a company spokesman changes from White to black, or when every baby depicted on a diaper package is black, brown, or mystery meat.
And, while I don’t have specific numbers to hand, I believe there is a large and influential cohort of chosen people in advertising  – world wide.

It’s hard for conservatives and grillers to understand. Their mindset is just “meh, throw some people on the screen and there’s your ad people.”
In reality the ads and broader woke agenda is run by manipulative psychopaths and every single aspect is carefully crafted to push an anti-white male agenda.

Similar, no, tied into the ESG and diversity industry scoring.
Remember, that “sensitivity” now “diversity” scoring determines the price of lawsuit defense charged by law firms, much as stocks, insurance, loans, or malpractice are priced according to perceived risk and liability management.

3g4me, my son told me this quite awhile ago at his company.  Coming from the University, I saw this as well with Blacks.  Pretty much the only Blacks we had were playing sports ball, but nevertheless they were depicted in all photos of campus life.

            I have been doing some research into this topic for something I am working on. It turns out that there are various reasons.Surprise! Surprise! One reason is that “academic”/activists who work hand in hand with the ADL as diversity consultants are also working with the ad industry. I was looking at that old clip of Krugman saying that white people’s power is going away recently. At the end he says that Bill de Blasio is the future and gets an evil smirk. There are diversity experts in academia who probably consort with Wall St. emissaries like Krugman who are committed to miscegeny as part of any means to get rid of white America.Here is the reference:https://www.hiltonheadmonthly.com/news/hilton-head/4293-diversity-101-is-advertising-reflecting-or-driving-social-changeThese people influence the advertising industry heavily.I also found that people in advertising seem to be convinced that showing black men with white women makes white people feel like they are helping the black man. I found no proof of this or studies that support this theory. But, the theory is that the consumer doesn’t want the product, they want a feeling of moral righteousness and that they are changing the world for the better by buying the product. Now that St. George, St. Trayvon and St. Michael B have been robbed of a life of service, astronautical daring and sweet little boyhood, nothing is more pressing than helping the downtrodden black man. Somehow, eliminating the white man and having his women conquered by black men makes white women feel like they are making the world a better place. In my research that is the crux of the theory the advertising world has. It makes no sense, but the theory of do-gooderism is pervasive in ad world journals and discussion.Another reason is that the entire executive suite is full of idiot savants. They may in fact be good at some business function, well maybe. But since we abandoned education in favor of credentialing and specialized skill verification decades ago, these people are hopelessly stupid. They think that they are bringing justice into the world by making blacks a minimum of 80% of the people in ads. In fact, they are discriminating against whites and showing the change they are unwilling to be. It is cost free virtue signaling – unless their nephew is a white aspiring actor. But, hey. To heck with his oppressor’s dreams anyway.Another reason is, “changing demographics.” You know that conspiracy theory that just happens to be happening. They see their market expanding to non-whites and want to capture market share. Of course, the problem is, whites are still a huge percentage of the affluent in America and a large portion of the existing consumer base. Why would they abandon that market I do not know. The representation story they tell does not add up with reality.The film, ad and entertainment industry are on the vanguard of white erasure. Amazon films has quotas that the JCOS candidate wants to mimic in the officer core of the military. Strict quotas on whites well below their actual percentage of the population. They are forcing those quotas across the entire industry. It is likely that white people will barely be seen at all if they pull this off without a massive class action lawsuit. (Hint Hint. Any lawyers on this forum could make a massive fortune doing lawfare that will sue these discriminators to the ground. Amazon Films should be a Prime target with a huge base of dispossessed and disgruntled people to draw from).No person in these glamor industries is going to say something about this. They will be labeled a racist. These industries take very little skill to get into and have very little opportunity relative to the people clamoring to get into them. So, everyone in it is a groveling coward. If the regime said goose stepping Nazis were the future, the same people would immediately do everything they could to prove their bonafides and retain their position and feature goose stepping Nazis everywhere. It is a herd. Moo!! Baaaa! Mooo!!! Baaaaa!!!!Ultimately, The Regime is anti-white. Why is it anti-white. Well, the white middle class is the nation that is the country. They have roots back to the first ships landing or they identify with those roots. They and their ancestors fought in all the wars, survived the downturns, and created the upturns. They hold the cultural memory, traditions and identity of America. The oligarchs want America gone. You get rid of the people, you get rid of the memory, you get rid of the traditions, you get rid of the history, you get rid of the country. You have your international shopping mall and a rootless rabble that is easy to control.It is that simple. The hegemonic power is anti-white. To be good little consumers and have status, the rabble of Cloud People, deathly afraid of being a Dirt Person, will do anything to stay in the clouds. They will even erase their own flesh and blood from the past, the present and the future for a whiff of the fluffy goodness. For those who aren’t the flesh and blood, well we know why they have no compunction about going full steam ahead with white erasure. It is human biology.

                Academia- credentials, job licenses- are the bottleneck.
The commies, natural bloviators, grabbed the teaching colleges first; everything flows from there.
(It’s a natural two-fer for them, since college’s real business, now, is to sell lemon loans and launder dark pools-
no longer prep school for high society or places where guys do cool stuff together.)

        Marketing is one of those things where you need at least some for a new product to get the word out.  But, it is also a mystery to me why Coke needs constant commercials. They’ve been around over 100 years and everyone and their mother knows who and what Coke is.  Plus, a lot of ads are just grating and create negative associations.OTOH, I still remember advertising from when I was a kid.  The “where’s the beef” advertising campaign has not been run since I was 13 years old and I will still remember it on my death bed.  Given there is only 1 Wendy’s anywhere near my house, I have no idea what it accomplished.

            Tars:  I am the worst possible candidate for any marketing campaign, being naturally contrary and skeptical and uncaring what the ‘cool kids’ think is the latest ‘thing.’  Fwiw, although I hate both Pepsi and Coke for being globalist, anti-White whores, I drink diet Coke.  And yet one of the ad jingles I remember most clearly from my youth is Pepsi’s “You have a lot to live, and Pepsi has a lot to give.”  That, and the Alka Seltzer (which I have never used) “Plop plop fizz fizz.”So some advertising may ‘work’ in the sense of being notable or memorable, but – at least in my case – it did not translate one iota into purchasing patterns.

                I tend to agree. I can remember ads that were outright illegal to run for as long as I understood the most basic of language. Yet, despite having never run other than the first few months of my life, I picked them up from somewhere. Like “Call for Philip Morris” and “Winston taste good like your cigarette should” and 4 out of 5 doctors recommend some cigarette brand or other.  I also remember those plop plot fizz fizz commercials and also have never once used them.  These are fairly benign jingles or statements. The car dealership commercials, especially on the radio make me want to stab my ears with an ice-pick. If I hear a single word about a car, the station gets changed.  I have to imagine that if I find them so grating that many or even most other people will. Yet, they persist.  Either I am a complete weirdo, which is certainly possible, or these commercial annoy everyone and have no real negative effect.Every single time I make the mistake of watching OTA TV, I get a reminder of why I don’t watch TV very often. Not only does the programming suck, but the ads are specifically designed for you to lose IQ points or to invoke a sense of disgust. But in this case, it’s probably me. Once you have become unaccustomed to TV and commercials and you hear them for the first time in a long time, it’s a very strange experience.

        Great essay. It took me many years to figure out that (with the possible exception of local markets) “marketing” is just a jobs program for favored-but-incompetent cloud people and “advertising” is at best a massive money-laundering process for favored corporations, and at worst a giant demoralization/subversive operation run globally by the usual suspects.

        Speaking of marketing, I propose that an old but useful word from the 19th century be resurrected: the word is ‘poltroon’.Poltroon: 1. an utter coward  2. a lazy, idle fellow; a sluggard; a fellow without spirit or courage; a dastard; a coward.This in order to relabel the GOP as the Godawfully Obnoxious Poltroons. It would have a couple of obvious (Godawfully Obvious Poltroons?) advantages. First it would redirect attention from the unfortunately true appellation the Stupid Party to where the blame squarely belongs, the grifthood that is party leadership. Second, the word appears to be (although it isn’t) a portmanteau of ‘politician’ and ‘troon’ (a fake female).

            Mow, all three were marketing geniuses in their own way. Ford understood elasticity of demand better than anyone. Westinghouse was a genius of public demonstrations of the potential for electricity. Rockefeller understood vertical integration and distribution better than anyone. And he was more ruthless than Bill Gates in crushing competitors.
Old-fashioned marketing is underappreciated. I understand the cynicism around today’s corporate BS and “hype”. But we can learn from the old masters.

            Twitter is part of “the bubble”  If it weren’t free, nobody would use it. It has spent most of its life losing vast sums of money.  Many internet companies are just vast money losing enterprises who somehow keep bringing in cash to stay afloat.  AFAIK, Patreon loses vast sums of money. I don’t even know how this is possible. It’s a skimming operation. How in the hell do you lose money inserting yourself between a customer and provider and charging a fee to do it?It brings me back to the point that much of the “virtual economy” has only existed in a larger bubble period of cheap money. If interest rates ever get back to normal, a lot of the phony economy is going to collapse. But it’s also possible interest rates stay low for the foreseeable future.  Can the auto and housing industry survive a high interest rate environment? As the cost of cars has ballooned since the 1970s, the loan period has ballooned to like 7 or 8 years.

        “If you are selling station wagons just when Chrysler introduced the minivan, no amount of marketing is going to change the fact that the minivan was a better family vehicle.”
But if I can get the authorities to force you to buy my station wagon, I don’t need to worry about marketing.
Coke could take a year off from marketing because the success of its prior marketing would enable it to do so.

            Would argue marketing is part of the multi-faceted “shelf space” strategy to get stores to stock your product in sufficient numbers. Once that succeeds, there’s not much more marketing can do other than some seasonal promotions, like their Christmas campaign, to grab even more shelf space..

                Interesting analysis Chet.  We assume marketing is directed at us, the consumer, in order to get us to buy the product.  But perhaps it’s directed at another audience—such as the store—and to encourage shelf space stocking decisions?  Food for thought.

                    Outwardly visible corporate “virtue signaling” is mostly directed at (let’s call it) finance. Internally it’s for employee demoralization. A little is for class signaling among professionals. Network TV ads, for example, are directed at other ad companies (and people whose fantasy career—because ad-funded media wildly romanticizes it—is “in advertising”).Of things we recognize as marketing or branding, pretty much only packaging and minor psychological terrorism (sweepstakes and coupons and other short cons) are directed at us.It hasn’t always been so bleak, and it’s not that bad everywhere (yet). YouTube compilations of Japanese Christmas ads will remind old guys of 1960s American TV because those companies not only want to build “positive associations” in customers’ minds—rather than running a 24/7 psy-op on them—they know and like normal people. Losers!

                    The battle for shelf space is invisible to the public but fierce and scientific. Point of sale promotions, end-cap displays, coupons and even in-store music are all diligently studied to maximize sales.
This is all part of marketing.

                    Archer Daniels Midland underwrote McNeil Lehrer Newshour for years.  Fully 5 people in the “listening audience” had any idea what ADM was or even what business they were in.  Yet it was probably the best “advertising” money they ever spent in terms of protecting themselves from ever being the subject of an unflattering news story and also influencing Congresscreeps about legislation, regulations, and other topics of vital interest to ADM’s seat at the federal welfare queen trough.  (This is in addition to their lobbying arm of course).As you suggest, the audience isn’t always who we assume it is.And then again, sometimes the culture war points are just as sweet as dinero in terms of satisfaction/ compensation.

        The DeSantis operation highlights just why the political class still does not really understand the internet. He thought he could hire professional meme-makers and then hire social media influencers who read talking points. Well, for a professional political operative in the USA, using your surrogates to read centrally-produced talking points is totally normal. Those supporters get the talking points then go on CNN or MSNBC or whatever and reads them over and over. This is a daily thing. Yet, here, you’re telling people to circulate these talking points on a website that shows what everyone is saying at all times. It’s really easy to spot the phony. As for memes, well, we saw it in 2016 and we see it now. Memes are funny because they are unexpected and organic, and our modern political system is simply incapable of doing anything unexpected or organic. You can give the DeSantis meme operation an unlimited budget and unlimited time and he will never come up with anything close to as funny as putting an Austrian man with a funny mustache on a jumbotron during a college football game.

        “If you are selling station wagons just when Chrysler introduced the minivan, no amount of marketing is going to change the fact that the minivan was a better family vehicle. If you are selling Ron DeSantis in the age of Trump, no amount of social media influencing is going to change the fact that he is just another conventional politician in an unconventional age. The best marketing is a product that sells itself, whether it is cars or politicians.”It’s probably still said about a star salesman that “he can sell ice to an eskimo” or “he can sell sand to an Arab.” But this is not true. If it’s not an utterly frivolous purchase, the good or service has to correspond to some need of the prospect. Advertising can bring that good or service to the attention of the prospect and a good salesman can explain, perhaps even persuade, a prospect that the good or service is congruent to the prospect’s need. For probably this reason a hack like de Santis cannot be sold to the electorate. Incidentally, it just came to memory about books that used to be published decades ago with titles like “The Selling of the President 1968.”

        Online influence is definitely a thing, but probably not in ads.The latest Robert Epstein accusation that Google manipulated a huge portion of American voters by doing things like reminding you to vote if (based on search history) it thought you were a Democrat, but not if you were a Republican.  That, and other things (like what came up with search results).Glaringly obvious to everyone here, but it’s the sort of background noise that probably has an impact in close elections with 170 million registered voters.Slightly OT:  Dilbert Adams might be a raging narcist on the road to a red (then black) pill but he’s right about the impact Tick-Tok “influencers” have on youths.  Are those ads?  They’re clandestinely bankrolled, so, probably?

        Ironically, it was the Bad Orange Man himself who convinced the political class that Twitter is real, at least when it comes to marketing candidates. Trump was forever “going viral”…Except that he was “going viral”on traditional media.I remember giving the Left some free advice back in 2016: You can neutralize Trump by covering him as if he were just another politician. Your story should read “Trump held a rally today, in which he discussed immigration, trade, and the economy.” Do “deep dives” and seventeen-part “analyses” of his “policies.” Make him just some suit doing the rounds with all the other suits, and he goes away.But instead Trump played them like a fiddle. He’d Tweet something outrageous (by Media standards), and the Media would freak out, andthat’swhat went “viral” — the Media freakout, on every television and newspaper front page. It wasn’t the Tweets, it was the traditional Media freakoutsaboutthe Tweets.It should’ve been obvious to the Media that Trump wasn’t running against Hillary Clinton — he was running againstThe Media.He spent 99% of his time talking about his press coverage; Ol’ Whatzerface, his so-called opponent, got the occasional swipe, but even then it was mostly along the lines of “Look at the Media being such simps about the Dragon Lady.”But the Media are stupid, so they think it was all Twitter, and that Twitter is real life.

            It really is incredible to me that no one in the media noted that Trumps was a product of the media, even before he was the bogeyman. There are clips of him from the 1980’s working the media to promote his real estate by promoting himself. I think the reason he was the god of every would-be social media influencer and gadfly is they saw in Trump the ideal. He literally talked his way into being a billionaire and president. That was only possible because the smart set allowed themselves to be manipulated by him.

                Trump got into trouble waay back when in Atlantic City and his Taj Mahal casino.  His casino, and casinos in general—he had three at the time I believe—were in economic trouble due to economic downturn.  Trump had a balloon loan of close to a billion dollars due.  The trade papers had a field day predicting Trump’s industries imminent financial demise.He met with the bankers and convinced them that a foreclosure would produce little more than a worthless and unsellable liability on their books, but if they restructured the debt they could continue to have a “Trump” asset on their books.  As the industry went belly up, Trump left the meeting not just with a restructure of the debt, but with a few hundred million $$$ more to play with.This really was marketing at the highest level.  And yes, a decade or two later when Trump was better situated, his casino empire declared bankruptcy and he dumped the investment on his backers.

                    My daughter bought a night’s stay at the Taj Mahal for my wife and I as a present back in the day when it was open.  When we were leaving the next day, we passed by the police tending to someone that had been stabbed.  This doesn’t have anything to do with Trump.  Just be aware that if you visit Atlantic City, you should be prepared to take a knife in the chest.

        The best marketing is a product that sells itself, whether it is cars or politicians.I read somewhere…it may have been in the comments here, that anything that needs gaslighting or legislation is almost always a bad idea. Advertising helps to get the word out for new products, but for the world-changing products, the advertising is almost always “Look at this cool thing!” rather than “You need this.”For example, I don’t think there was any gaslighting or legislation for typewriters, stock purchasing, airplane tickets, or refrigerators, and certainly not for the internet and mobile phones. Did Donald Trump even have political ads?But think about the things being gaslit/legislated which have dubious popularity: airport security, insurance plans, plant-based meat, Democrats/Republicans, electric cars.

            I am informed by a former marketing executive close to me that major consumer companies do indeed stop advertising profitable products that everyone already knows about…It’s called milking the brand..It’s much more important, and easier, to keep the customers you have than than to woo other peoples’ customers, so they run little promotions as well, as you can see on cereal boxes…

            Electric vehicles come to mind. Without major subsidies and now legislation gradually banning the production and use of internal combustion engines there would not be a market for EVs. EVs, unlike the refrigerator or the internet, did not sell themselves

        Campaign gurus had talked themselves into thinking that social media was the way to go after Obama “used social media” to beat Satan in 2008 and Trump used “viral memes” to beat She-Satan in 2016.  However, if they were honest (lol) the 2020 election provided a refutation of the strategy as Trump was “othered” from all social media and yet the regime still needed truckloads of ballots to defeat him.

            Right—the meme-Woodstock people complemented Trump, they didn’t get him elected. Because of his jokey, not-otherwise-credible persona, the memes played to his single clear strength for campaigning purposes. Robert Kennedy Jr. is a useful contrast here, since there’s no way he could implement cartoon advertising. Nikki Haley could never do that— she is the wholesome POC you are supposed to be eager to show off to your fellow whites.I was shocked in 2017 to see many people in the lower rungs of academia and journalism earnestly researching whether “memes impact elections;“ this is the old clothes-make-the-man fallacy, but I now have learned to expect less from academics/journalists.

        What following does Twitter have today?  I must admit that I used to surf over there to read comments by a few people, but now it seems like you have to register for an account to read anything.  I have not and will not do that, and I wonder if traffic to that site has dropped because others feel the same as I do.

            It’s kind of crazy on Twitter right now because you can get away with way more than you used to be able to get away with before Elon took over. It is definitely not the leftist Safe Space that it used to be.
I have an account there just for fun. There is a lot of fun to be had on there trolling the ADL and the like. There are some seriously funny people on the far right doing some entertaining stuff on there. Things like the racist Star Trek posters are juvenile but still fun.

            I don’t think Elon is doing himself any favors by making it a walled garden where you MUST register simply to passively read comments. Likewise, they’ve become utterly paranoid about bots so if you do something like use a VPN and then login again on a different server or IP you have to jump through a somewhat complex series of hoops to “unlock” your account.
Overall? Not worth it… make something too much of a hassle and no one will use it. Simple as.

            He had an article about California in the most recent issue of Chronicles.  They still have him listed as a contributor on their website and just posted a good piece he wrote comparing liberals concerns about Palestine with how they have completely forgotten about the East Palestine, Ohio train derailment.  They even tagged him in it when they posted it to Twitter.  Pedro did not post it in his own feed, at least that I saw.He seems to be the one who wants to put Chronicles behind him.  Maybe the DeSantis people have promised him something once the campaign is over.  He would be a fool to believe them if they have.

                He did a good take down of some of the scumbag grifters around Trump some months back, the current iteration of the Bill Mitchell types, although seemingly more integrated into the actual campaign. I found it notable but not surprising.  That said he just waded too far into the deep end and strangled his developing brand in the crib. I think he wanted to shoot too high too soon.

            Actually my first thought upon seeing that was remembering a fellow Gen-X coworker in the 90s asking me if WWI was “the one with Japan”.  She didn’t have a clue who fought when and in what war and certainly no idea as to why they did so either*.  Given that, and especially with the raft of foreigners and affirmative-action students at universities, it’s quite possible for a student to have just grouped a bunch of stuff from 20th century leaders for a quiz and put it up there without a second thought about mustache man.*(Every history class taken in school was poorly paced and the back quarter to third of the book, where WWI and WWII were, was never touched.  Were it not for voracious consumption of history material outside of school I probably would have been in the same boat).

                A great way to blow boomer’s minds and look smart is to point out to them that yes, Japan was actually involved in WW1 and they were… gasp… get this… on the USA’s side, even!The eternal old person just kind of assumes everyone is what they were when they were young and always has been and pointing out that Japan and Italy were on the “good guys” side (not that there were any good guys in WW1 but you get the rhetorical point) in WW1 and then weren’t in WW2 ties their brains in knots. Something happened between one and the other to change that, wonder what?Similar to the whole “Muslims didn’t really used to hate whitey and actually had a pretty good relationship with Germans in particular” thing. Muslims have always hated us for our freedoms, thinks the eternal mcdonald’s consumer. Except they didn’t, but something changed between one event and the other event.

                I can promise you that your 90s Gen X Clueless Chick co-worker is a fucking Rhodes Scholar compared to the detritus being churned out of University today.These kids are borderline retarded and I’m not even joking. They know –nothing– about anything. Not only would they not know whether Japan was involved in WW1 they likely are not aware there -was- a WW1.Absolutely historically illiterate, innumerate, and most shockingly, quite proud of it and bursting with self-esteem. Add to that the general mixing of the gene pool with the mud genetics of the goblinas, Half-ricans, etc. and yeah Brazil will be here by 2035 I’d guess at the latest.

        This is why history books are full of bad ad campaigns. Even the dumbest ideas will win over some people, because it is assumed that all attention is good attention, so even a terrible ad can work.What of the reverse effect: Your ad is so damned stupid I REFUSE to buy your product?The truth of it is, most of what passes for marketing is nonsense.Awaits the comment section filled with everyone’s favorite Stupid Ad Campaign.Those people then hired lots of “social media influencers” who would talk about Ron DeSantis as if he is their old pal. Never mind that many of them are weirdos and conmen. After all, any attention is good attention and these social misfits have proven to be great at getting attention on Twitter.All you need to know about “social media influencers” is in 2007 John Edwards hired Amanda Marcotte as his “blogmaster”, a proto “influencer” position.Amanda Freaking Marcotte.It ended as well as one would expect. 🤦‍♂️Apparently hasn’t gotten any better from what we see.If you are selling station wagons just when Chrysler introduced the minivan, no amount of marketing is going to change the fact that the minivan was a better family vehicle.Irony of ironies, I would ask what happens when a vehicle or product gets so ubiquitous that it actually generates a “negative” image? You are correct that minivans were more space and fuel efficient than the old “Body on Frame” wood paneled “Family Truckster” (or their equally odd FWD unit body equivalents [Think K Car or Ford Escort station wagons]). They were red hot as a product and sales took off. But they got an image as a “mom-mobile” (remember the political wonks mentioning “Minivan Moms” as a voting block?), never shook it, and sales fell. Now Karen drives to the local store in an SUV or CUV to hector the poor manager for failing to meet her needs.Maybe Ron DeSantis is a minivan in a Donald Trump Bro-Dozer lifted pick-up world. 🤔(Joe Biden would be a rusted out 1977 Plymouth Volare. Or what’s left of a Chevrolet Vega of an unknown model year.)

            Were minivans classified as trucks for import duty and air pollution purposes? There used to be boatloads (literally) of small trucks, mostly from Japan, on the road because they benefitted from lower import duties and less expensive engine regulation and were therefor a good value, relatively. I owned a used Datsun, then a new Nissan (same company, with some disimprovements in its product).

        Checking in on Pedro, he is now getting into name calling arguments with Nick Fuentes on Twitter.  He is averaging around 25 replies to his tweets and 150 to 200 likes.  I don’t know what the DeSantis donors are paying him, but even $2,500 a month can’t even be close to worth the money.  In the event he gets canned before DeSantis dropped out it seems likely he will scorched earth on them, which will be entertaining for a few days.Maybe it is because I do have an accounting background, but I really thought there would be some shift on how campaigns operated after Trump and a lot of this paid nonsense would go away. That candidates could watch what Jeb did in 2016 and learn nothing really reinforces the idea they are just paid actors.

                Looking back at it, I think the Noem allegation was a test run at being a DeSantis smear merchant.  It was obvious he was just repeating rumors he was being given by rivals in the national party and SD state reps who didn’t like Noem.  It was weird too Pedro didn’t even mention it when the rumors were proven true.

I’ve been having an affair with Kristi Noem too.  It’s been very hot, but I know it’s wrong.  She won’t leave me alone.
I tell her that I can’t associate with her due to her fake populism and that she only reinforces the system that is killing us.  But then she gets sexy with me again and I lose my resolve.

            Political parties exist primarily to make money. So it makes perfect sense that they would keep on campaigning the “old” way. Since that’s how they get paid. If winning were the #1 goal, or a goal at all, they might change, but it isn’t.

        I give Steve Sailer a lot of grief, but he has made a very good point in the past. Before becoming the “Great Noticer” (and, more lately, the Sgt. Schultz of noticing), he worked in marketing.During his time in that business, he noticed (no pun intended) that advertising when a company had actually change/improved a product or was introducing a new product worked. But if the company was peddling the same old product, advertising didn’t do anything to sales or brands awareness.DeSantis had nothing new or better to offer Trump voters, so he marketing went nowhere. In the end, you have to wonder why he ran at all. He’s a watered-down Trump. How is that appealing to Trump voters, especially if they’re enraged that Trump is getting shafted by ruling class.

            If you can sift through what the DeSantis influencers are peddling the argument is “the policies Trump ran on in 2016, but pushed by someone competent.”  They harp on all Trump’s faults and shortcomings as if those are some great revelation to his supporters.  The argument that DeSantis is going to get them implemented is laughable.

                What the GOP establishment has never understood about Trump supporters is that Trump supporters love that Trump is a loose cannon. They love that he says crazy stuff and attacks the establishment – both Dems and the GOP.I think that many Trump supporters do understand that Trump is a more than a bit of a carnival barker, but they also understand that you need a guy who’s a bit out there to take on literally everyone in the system.Because GOP establishment hates Trump the person so much, they just assume that everyone else does too, which means that they could offer up a milk toast version of Trump and his supporters would flock to their guy.DeSantis bought into that. Simply by being aligned with the GOP establishment, DeSantis repealed Trump supporters. Now that I think about it, Trump really has destroyed the GOP. Being a part of the GOP establishment makes you unacceptable to Trump supporters. In essence, they’ve created a completely separate wing of the party, and I don’t know if they’ll ever go back into the fold.You’re either in their wing or your not. DeSantis isn’t.

                    Prior to Trump, I do think that most normiecons would flock to whatever guy/gal the GOP put forward because “at least s/he’s not a Democrat”. As long as I’ve been alive, normiecons were always angry at what was happening to their country, and they’ll go for the guy who says they’ll reverse what the Dems have done…cut spending, enlarge the military, family values, fight terrorism, through the years, whatnot.Trump threw a light on a great many things, but I still think that many if not most normiecon voters will flock to a milquetoast Trump because FJB! It won’t be 2012 and Romney again, ever, thank God, but I imagine the person who runs against Biden will pretend to have aggro. Imagine Nimrata talking about trannies and inflation and crime and you get the point.I hope I’m wrong…we’ll see how the voter turnout is in 2024. That will be the true test of how much Trump upset things.

                        If Trump isn’t the candidate, the GOP will lose badly. Enough Trump supporters will stay home to completely tank the GOP candidate.
Granted, Trump will also likely loose, so GOP is done with the presidency.

                The amusing thing to me is that so many of them repeat the daily talking points sent out by the campaign. You would think that clever internet influencers would know to avoid this. Of course, the DeSantis people should have know to avoid repeating Never Trump rhetoric in public and private, but it is hard to hide your true feelings.

            Good post – but one thing.  Yes – he’s a watered down trump, but he is also lacking in the personality of Trump.  He’s ultimately an establishment guy, and he lacks the tenacity that Trump has allowing him to irritate our ruling class more than anyone else ever could.  DeSantis will make deals with his friends on the left, he won’t be the annoying wrecking ball that keeps swinging back at them.

                    Trump will most likely lose, not “loose”.
It’s maddening how common that error is, especially coming from intelligent, articulate people.

            Well, my 1980s vintage MBA Marketing textbook already understood Sailer’s observation about diminishing returns to advertising etc. The early marketing computer simulations we worked on – really just linear programming /optimization models – incorporated all these ideas. The state of the “art” today is much more sophisticated.
DeSantis is the “linear optimization” of Trump haha. But it’s not the same product, is it?
This shows the limits of marketing, but it doesn’t invalidate marketing itself. I think this is perhaps the distinction Zman should have made.

            Way back when I was starting out, I was tasked with building a P&amp;L for the various marketing campaigns the company had been doing for the year. This was in the early days of desktop computing, so I spent a lot of time digging through drawers, looking up physical invoices. I found that a lot of the invoices were booked in creative ways by accounting. I also found that there was no way to track revenue from these marketing campaigns that was reliable. It was a fun challenge for a young guy.I reached the point where none of it made any sense, so I got a meeting with the VP of marketing to get some help. I just assumed I was not understanding something. This guy was an old timer who enjoyed his liquor. He said to me, “Every year I exceed my budget by five to ten percent. In good years, I tell the boss that these efforts paid for themselves. In bad years, I tell the boss that I went over budget to mitigate the downturn. Every year I promise to spend no more than I spent last year.”A few days later I was told to drop that project and work on another project.

                HA. Love it.
Early in my career I was in big box retail and one time I was invited to the monthly marketing read out. Last 90, next 90 blah blah blah.
They got to my department and say the last flier was a huge success! we sold over 1,000 units of the widget due to this ad. I spoke up with the fact we normally sell 800 per week, so the the lift was 200 units. Still a wonderful accomplishment but you can’t claim the whole nut.
I was never invited back to the marketing read out.

                “Slowly, Z got ‘educated’.”“Every year I exceed my budget by five to ten percent. In good years, I tell the boss that these efforts paid for themselves. In bad years, I tell the boss that I went over budget to mitigate the downturn. Every year I promise to spend no more than I spent last year.”When budgeting, always ask for 20 – 30% more than you really need. Your boss will freak and browbeat you down to 10%. Then spend every penny because if you still have money left over at the end of the year, they won’t give you extra next year. 👍

In bad years, I tell the boss that I went over budget to mitigate the downturn. Every year I promise to spend no more than I spent last year.”This tact is sooo common in various forms.  That’s one of the reasons I was a hard nose in committee discussions back in the university.  I had a simple rejoinder for all such claims:  “If you can’t measure it, it doesn’t exist”.My discussion then turned to what is typically called “deliverables”.  Never was very successful, but it kept me off of even more committee assignments during my tenure.

            On point for your comment, I think:https://www.unz.com/isteve/what-if-advertising-on-google-and-facebook-or-tv-doesnt-much-work/“… I’ve often recounted the curious tale of how in the 1980s I worked for a marketing research start-up that created perhaps the all time best real world lab for carrying out Randomized Controlled Trials.In eight towns, we bought the new laser beam checkout scanners for all the supermarkets and drug stores in town in return for their cooperation. We recruited 3000 households in each town who agreed to identify themselves to the checkout clerk, so we could record all their consumer packaged goods shopping. And we controlled what TV commercials they saw on cable TV. So we could divide our sample into test and control groups that had exactly identical amounts of purchasing of the client’s product over the previous year and then show them more or different ads for a year and measure how much their purchasing increased.Even today. this sounds like science fiction, but it was all up and running 40 years ago.Brand managers at CPG firms were initially wildly enthusiastic: finally, they could scientifically prove to the beancounters at headquarters that their advertising is so effective that they should double their ad budgets!But after a half decade of spectacular growth in our service, it turned out more or new advertising only rarely increased sales. And I don’t mean that doubling the ad budget only increased sales in the test group of thousands of families by, say, 7% over sales in the control group of families, and that didn’t quite payout in terms of profitability. No, I mean, the typical result was that the sales in the test cell that saw twice as many ads as the control cell bought 0.1% less.”
