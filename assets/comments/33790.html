            I can’t blame him for that bumper-sticker on his shiny newTesla. It’s to protect him from vandalism by leftwing fantatics. However, they probably won’t read it before keying or trashing his car. They are thugs. Left-wingers commit most of the political violence in the US – including, for example, Antifa and Black Crimes Matter.
It is amusing that most Tesla owners vote Democrat. They suffer fromTDSandMIM(Musk Induced Madness). What will they do with their cars now? Perhaps they can donate them toKars4Kids, to get a tax-deduction.

            This is like Hamilton (the Musical!) tickets.
High value when they were exclusive.
Low-rent when, after years, the chuds got access to them.
The left is in a bit of a conundrum.
Somehow, they’re supposed to sell/switch a $50k+ car and adopt a gas guzzler because last week they became unfashionable.
Not in a week.  Right. This. Second.
Honestly, if I owned a Tesla (I’m Tesla curious), if anyone put a AZI symbol on it I’d just let it ride.
People who know, would know.

        Eh. I know almost nothing about this Mahmoud Khalil character but the whole arrest and deportation thing seems transparently bogus. I certainly concede that we have the sovereign right to deport any non-citizen at any time.But let’s get real. We let him in in 2022, gave him a green card in 2024, but now all of a sudden he’s a security threat to the U.S.? Bullshit. The problem is that he pissed off the Jews for complaining about the way Israel razed the Gaza Ghetto much the same way that Hitler razed the Warsaw Ghetto.Khalil is only being labeled a “national security threat” because the U.S. is controlled by ZOG. As far as his support for Hamas, so what? Recall that Hamas wasdemocratically elected. Has Hamas ever threatened the U.S. or engaged in acts of “terrorism” here?Crickets.Hell, the United States allowedLeon fucking Trotskyto live in New York in 1916-17 and we didn’t deport him, and we are supposed to believe that this Khalil guy is worse? Rubbish.I agree that we don’t need Arab Muslims in this country… we don’t need their Jewish antagonists, either.

                Don’t you worry that they will use the precedence of “you can’t criticize Israel” on the native population, just like they did with the war on terror provisions?
I’m the last person who wants to defend the rights of non-whites in my country, but we probably should, simply for selfish reasons.

Basically they already do that. A number of Red States (and even Congress IIRC) tried to criminalize boycotting Israel, and DeSantis signed a law in Florida practically criminalizing opposition to Israel or the Jews. If you are a supporter of Hamas or Hezbollah you can run afoul of federal anti-terrorist laws even though those groups have not committed any acts of violence in the U.S.
And look at how Stefanik gaslit those Ivy League presidents for allowing free speech on campus.

                    Of course not. J6 had absolutely nothing to do with Israel. Whatever they want to use as an excuse, they will use. Including wearing white after Labor Day.
Was Mahmoud protesting about justice for  Ashli Babbitt or the Brunswick 3? White Zoomer males not being hired because of DIE? Then fuck him. We don’t want or need him or anyone like him.

        Lawfare is anAbuse of Process. Letitia Lardbutt’s campaign against VDare is a most egregious example of this. The NY judicial system (including judges and prosecutors) is run by leftwing, pro-crime, Soros-funded activists.
If the Trump administration wins its war against lawfare and activist “judges”, it will be a great victory for the rule of law, as opposed to the rule of judges (kritocracy).

            That’s anachronistic, no?Try a different attack: Niall was like Patrick except that Niall’s father was Irish, not Romano-British. Unlike Patrick, a foreigner whose name is Latin, Niall was born on Ireland.Even the name Patrick (frompatricius, patrician) is suspicious. His father, Calpernius, is supposed to have been a decurion. Decurions were selected from thecurialesclass, wealthy middle class townfolk. Patricians, otoh, belonged to the ruling class.So “Patrick” appears to be some sort of selfglorification or even a postmortem colorization by Christian biographers who wanted to show an elite origin. The name’s use for the guy is somewhat like naming your son Rex (king). Hmmm. Maybe this explains how the saint obtained that name. It was given by his parents, but I doubt it.

        Much as I respect Derb and have enjoyed his commentary over the years, time has passed him by. He is rapidly becoming a yesterday-man. Derb’s enthusiastic promotion of a lefty’s novella-length screed in Harper’s (“first rate”) is disappointing. The insights in it are hardly new: the bureaucracy is the fourth branch of government. Zman has been shouting this from the rooftops for years. Even Musk has taken this up recently — long before the Harper’s left and Derb discovered it.

        TDS and Elonhass are a single phenomenon in the mainstream, but on theultra far extreme radicalright there’s some distinction. I hate Musk enough to be almost insane about it, and I think Trump is great (enough). Fairly common attitude among non-nerds.The reverse of it has been increasing lately. Crazy Uncle Trump is too weird and American for the present-day libertarian, for example. (Libertarians used tobeguys like that, but now they’re dorks and weasels.) Trump’s a great character who can’t be mistaken for the hero in an Ayn Rand romance novel. Musk can be, if you overlook almost everything about him. The business-groupie right really wants a man like that to come down the mountain and give ’em the eye, so they pretend it’s happened.
