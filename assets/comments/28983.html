        Whomever the ADL tasks with listening to the show must have picked up on the copyright discussion and dropped a dime as the Spreaker show is down.  Odysee still works.

        Mariah Carey, like Whitney Houston, is into a self-aggrandizing sort of sonic waterboarding. Even Pavarotti understood louder is not always better. She’s also a truly awful person who berates and torments everyone who works for her, working in crazy riders on her contract, specifying all green M &amp; Ms be picked out of the bowl on the craft services table backstage. Apparently the “melanin” that made her husband Nick Cannon so warm and kindhearted didn’t rub off on her. His melanin didn’t help him with his lupus nephritis, either. Black may not crack, but it seems to break pretty easily. Gas station fare pretty much ensures a foot lost to grape soda and heart disease courtesy of spicy chips to everyone in the hood purchasing their groceries from the local Hindu behind the bulletproof glass in the “food desert.”Kubrick actually contemplated going with the Sid Vicious version of “My Way” for “Full Metal Jacket”  but went with “Painted Black” at the last minute. It’s a good thing, too, as that “Great Train Robbery” visual quote from “Goodfellas” where Joe Pesci shoots the camera at the end is perfect.In New Year’s news, it turns out some man “from Maine” tried to hack a bunch of people with a machete while screaming his allegiance to Allah during the New Year’s festivities. Hopefully he only hacked up people who voted for Biden. Happy New Year!

            Wth you 1000% on the Mariah Houston, Whitney Carey critique. Whistling is a more apt description for the sound these women inflict upon our ears.The M&amp;M thing is a David Lee Roth innovation, although with him it was red ones to be purged. His was more of a ruse, ie. if venue personnel ignored this rider, chances are they ignored others as was the case in a Washington state concert which had to be cancelled because the stage would have collapsed due to incompetent carpentry insufficient for the massive stage equipment.The Sid Vicious version of My Way played in the closing credits of Goodfellas iirc.

        “Shitavious Cook, who has been in custody since he was 15 years old on first-degree murder charges, has been sentenced to 22 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted first-degree murder and dismembering a human body in two shooting incidents that occurred in August 2011.”

            My favorite black name? “La-A,” which is pronounced, “Ladasha.” “Barkavarius” was also a great name, like some kind of royal basset hound.

        Thanks for the show Z Man. Concerning the Emergency Broadcast System ( EBS) it’s now the Emergency Alert System ( EAS) and it is still around and encompasses not only local radio and tv stations but state and local agencies and through not just over the air signals but also through internet and cellular alerts.

        Well that was a nice surprise, thanks Zman, you sound great today. My mother always said what ever you do on New Year’s Day you do the rest of the year. With that she would wink a laugh in her old Manchester way. She was a good girl. She taught me a lot about making it in the world, nyc especially. In the late 60’s I would spend New Year’s Eve with my grate grandmother celebrating her birthday on 59 th and first avenue while my parents worked in a nightclub. Cigaret girl and valet parking for the boys that used to run new York. We were so close to Times square and never went. I didn’t understand why back then, I do now. By the way that was Ron Tutt playing the drums on that Elvis song. I got to see him play a whole bunch when he was in Jerry Garcia’s side project JGB. Thanks for the content especially the substack stuff. 50 bucks A year is a great deal. One last thing, the first baby born In NYC was……drumroll  please, Asian ! I haven’t been back in 22 years. It would be like going to a wake.

        As a lifelong Louisianian and LSU alum, I was glad to hear that you’ll be pulling for LSU in the bowl game and that you think LSU had the best looking uniforms in college football (they really do).
Happy New Year and Geaux Tigers.

        You can feel cash through an envelope, even if it’s wrapped in a sheet of paper. It does not feel the same as ordinary paper inside the same envelope. I’m not sure tinfoil does anything but exacerbate that, because it feels different too. (And of course if there really is snoopy-scanning, would do nothing but set off red flags.)Back when sending cash was more common, and fear of theft was more real (since mail was still hand-sorted) there were card-and-envelope combos sold specifically to prevent detection of included cash.If you’re worried about hiding cash in the mail, use a Hallmark card. Works just fine. Sent by the millions, so nothing to attract untoward attention.

        Read a lot of Faulkner in my early 20s. Worthwhile writer.At uni wrote a history paper somehow based on Homage to Catalonia. I don’t really remember. But I loved that book.The big takeaway: Orwell went down there to fight the fascists, and ended up running for his life from the Commies (his side). Still convalescing from a sniper’s bullet to the throat, he had to sneak over the border into France. I think this was his great awakening to the reality of authoritarianism not being only on the Right. But I’m no Orwell expert, and it’s been a long time.Bonus trivia: One weird thing that struck me was how his wife was with him in Barcelona, and he mentioned some other political guy hanging around them a lot. Another Lefty. Orwell never came out and said anything directly, or even hinted, but I got a strong sense that he was unconsciously documenting his cuckoldry. Just a few years ago I stumbled on a reference to Sonia’s in fact having an affair with that other man. Orwell was indeed a decent, complicated man.

        I’m with you on New Year’s, Z. Staying up till midnight has never meant dicksquat to me, so I rarely do it. And down here in Texas, folks try to cram black-eyed peas down your piehole on New Years Day for good luck. I don’t do that one, either.

            Ostei, black-eyed peas and greens seasoned with smoked ham is a southern soul-food, and for most outside of the south, perhaps an acquired taste.  It is in fact the dish I prepared for New Years Day, even though I don’t have a superstitious belief one, including that eating it brings wealth (the greens) and good luck (the b-e peas) for the year.  I just happen to like it and in my family it is a tradition to uphold.I didn’t celebrate New Years Eve this year, because I don’t think there was much to celebrate in 2022 nor will be in 2023.  I hope Z and his cadre of commenters will disabuse me of that notion, but generally, they are realistic to a fault and I don’t hold out much hope.

        I watched the New Year’s show from NYC last night. They had some sow bellowing “Imagine,” with they lyrics: “Imagine there’s no countries, It isn’t hard to doNothing to kill or die for. And no religion, too.”
I expected her to say, “except Ukraine,” but she didn’t.
Then I checked out a Guy Lombardo show on YouTube, from 1971, which I also used to watch with my family in my youth. How much better the people were than the those interviewed on the show last night. The decline is so visible.

        Happy New year to you all from London, Englandland.I have always called a crappy remake of a classic song as vinylcide.Regarding new year shows. Last nights London event, on the tv, sod standing in the rain was ruined by overdubbing with crap about lezzer footy, refugees welcome, Eukraine blather and fag worship. I lasted nearly 2 minutes.

            CMT has been owned by Viacom and under the MTV umbrella for about 20 years, so that tells you it’s political leanings. However, it’s really only been the last 3-4 that they’ve openly gone woke. During one of the shooting events the left tried to capitalize on to take firearms, CMT was running non stop gun safety reform ads. Then it was constantly flying a CMT rainbow logo during homo month. All of this for an audience that’s completely against these things.What changed with a lot of companies 3-4 years ago is that they stopped caring about total profit. Sure, CMTs viewership is probably down a decent portion, but they’re still making money hand over fist, and what matters is that they’re promoting the cause and breaking their shoulders patting themselves on the back. It’s why the go woke, go broke, thing doesn’t work. When you have a mega corp like Disney or Amazon, they don’t care if they lose millions because of their politics. What’s millions when you make billions?

                Heard an explanation from an economics-dude: Operating capital. Corporations run on debt. If Blackrock says Be Woke or No Money, they will be woke, even if in the long term it kills the company.
Blackrock is something like 51% Chinese owned. Demoralization as silent conquest is still a Thing.

            These days going out on Amateur Night is more of a giant hassle than anything else.
Who wants to deal with all the crazies and sobriety checkpoints?

                Here on the Worst Coast they have this annoying “tradition” among the shitlibs of celebrating New York’s Eve (9pm) and then our own local New Year’s at midnight. I was out walking my constipated dog during the former last night. I was glad that was the extent of my involvement in last night’s festering festivities. I just saw Karl’s post above about Elvis and thought “glad Pepper finally managed to ignore the distracting premature fireworks and avoided the King’s fate”.

            CMT appointed Mike Huckabee to the board of their foundation, a perfect selection, then withdrew his appointment after a queer talent agent threatened to withdraw his clients.  That ended any interest or support from me for CMT.
