        This story was reported earlier (10 November 2011) here:http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=30455The photo doesn’t look nearly as impressive as the description.From the comment to the above article:http://www.megalithic.co.uk/comments.php?sid=30455&amp;tid=42495&amp;mode=nested&amp;order=&amp;thold=Hranicky is applying to have the Whites’ stone circles added to Virginia’s list of archaeological sites.“It will be recorded,” said state archaeologist Mike Barber.Barber said several ceremonial observatories across North America are attributed to Paleoindians.“Jack has recorded several of these types,” he said. “The real problem is proving what these things are. We haven’t arrived at that level yet.”Barber said he has received a preliminary report on the site from Hranicky, and is trying to schedule a time to visit it.Is the Clarke County site an ancient solar observatory for early Americans?Barber is cautious.“I’m not to the point where I can say that this is one of them.”Also, Mr. White seems to have some business ventures in mind for the site:http://doubtfulnews.com/2014/05/important-native-american-archaeological-site-found-in-virginia/

        I’ve lived in Oklahoma for years and happen to know a fair number of actual Indians.   Two of them speak their native languages, which is extremely rare these days.   Ordinary Indians invariably use the word ‘Indian’ to refer to themselves and to each other.
‘Native Americans’ are properly the descendants of the English and British colonists, since ‘America’ – both the good and bad parts – was a product of the British-American imagination and established in every detail by British-Americans, with a bit of input from some of the other European colonists.

        “Anyone who has spent time in the wild has run across some amazing looking stuff created by Mother Nature.”
Therein you have part of the problem.  How many of the reporters have spent much time in the wild?

            Few, I bet. Reporters are not terribly bright and they are very gullible. It’s why social science send them press releases with executive summaries of their work. They know the reporters will just cut and paste without questioning it.

        “Actually Christopher, Viceroy and Governor of the Indies, you weren’t in India as such. So the people aren’t actually Indians.”
“My Liege, King Ferdinand, why should we quibble over such minutia. In 500 years will people still be using the same silly gentilic?”
“Then let it be for now…”
“Oh, one more thing highness, thank you for shooing off the last of those pesky Mohammedans. Surely that is the last we have seen of them…”
