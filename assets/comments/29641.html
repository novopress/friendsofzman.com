        My Dad was that kind of a conservative.  He was an “Executive” for the last 20 years of his life.  What he wanted out of government was fairness and predictability.  He avoided radicals on both ends of the spectrum and tried to support reasonable people who didn’t rock the boat.
Later in his life, I had conversations with him about how those milquetoast Republicans always lost in the end and he was in reluctant agreement.

        You said, “What Jaffa offered conservatives was a way to attach themselves to the creedalism that came out of the war experience…”
1945? or 1865?

        Conservatism is the grift, not the gift, that keeps on giving.  I was just thinking today how we are 6 and a half years post-2016 election, yet this country is more Left than ever.  What has really been accomplished for the Right since?  Sure, conservative media personalities have made a ton of money, but how has the life of the typical rightist voter been improved?  This country is less White, the nuclear family is all but dead.  Women are more unhinged than ever, and White men are all but shut out from participating in society.  Ask yourself what the Right is even trying to accomplish anymore.  What do they have to sell your typical disenfranchised rightist?  It is all garbage, like political fast food.  It might feel good in the moment to “own the libs” but it does nothing to actually improve this country.  I really hate what is on the horizon.  It is very demoralizing to realize there is not one thing to give me hope.

            If you asked a leftist they would say conservatives are winning. Because abortion. And because capitalism and racism still exist, and we don’t have medicare for all. And because trannies aren’t accepted…. actually they are accepted, there is nowhere they can’t go, but they aren’t LOVED, thus conservatives are winning. Thing is, they really believe all that.We don’t have political representation (I could just end the sentence right there) that is up to the challenge of dealing with the deranged movement that the left has become. They snapped when Trump won. That was the genesis of clown world. Doesn’t seem to be anything that can turn it off.“Democracy” lacks the tools to deal with such insanity. There is no way to deal with them that is both peaceable and effective. What I’m getting at is, there is nothing, within the legal structure of our constitutional republic, that the conservative movement can do about any of this, even if it were superbly led.

            We need to stop being merely opposed to progressive lunacy. We need to offer an alternative moral framework. That frameworks starts with advocating that all power be local. Local means free association. Local means excluding whomever you want. Local means hundreds of thousands of bottom up experiments to discover what works best.

                What we had in decades past, you’d think that stuff would have sold itself. What can we possibly offer to people who were unable to buy into America at its peak? What we’re talking about now is a rearguard action. Lifeboats.

        “The alternative vision to crossdressers waving their genitals around the schoolyard is not a spiffy new graph showing IQ differences. The antidote to progressive lunacy is not appeals to the magic of the marketplace like “go woke, go broke.”I don’t think we’re as shameless or unethical as they are to even match their strategy.  Leftists are a motley crew of some of the most disturbed people, willing to live like there’s no tomorrow to defend the honor of black violent criminals, trannies with AIDS, grooming pedophiles, man hating feminists, etc.What’s the right wing equivalent of men in burlesque showing off to kids in the library?  Maybe we can make videos teaching kids that gays spread AIDS and go to hell.  Antifa would burn the place down.  Will moms and dads with careers and bills be willing to die on that hill like so many retarded leftists are willing to die on theirs?  With celebrities bailing antifa out of jail?  We’re surrounded on all sides by the joker’s henchmen.  I think it’s going to be long continuing perversion of american society while conservatives, christians, and right wingers try to raise their kids in bubbles and wait for the spiteful mutants in power AND in the streets to die off.  By then, the cartels will probably be running the country, but at least they’re not gay.

                Also, all the massive foundations created by the millionaires of the late 19th and early 20th century have been captured by leftists. The Tide Foundation, The Ford Foundation, Carnegie, Getty, etc. Everything they left is being used for pervesions they’d hate.

                    They really oughtta take Leland Stanford’s name off the university he founded. He wouldn’t approve of them anymore than they do of him. It’s a win win.
Along similar lines, one wonders why the Ford Foundation retains the name.

        When I was embarking on my career in my early 20’s, I joined Rotary.  This was also at the time women were beginning to make inroads in business.  Of course it was a male only organization – the horror.  Well that couldn’t stand and it soon caved.  Some of the older guys in the group, with decades of membership quit as a result.  Being the young whippersnapper, I considered them old fuddyduddies.  In looking back now, if I’d been in their shoes, I’d have done the same damn thing.  Women can have their own groups, as can blacks and everyone else other than White men.  Most likely because White men are superior to anyone else at virtually any endeavor and the leftards can’t allow that.This now may offend some, but I have become heartily sick and tired of the “foreign” contingent in AINO – and by that I mean all non-White people – blacks, orientals, muzzies, pajeets, throwin samoans, beaners, whatever.  They’re nearly everywhere you freaking go and in nearly everything you freaking see.  I don’t care if their great-great-great grandpappy was born in this former country – they don’t belong.  The last thing I need to hear is some black or dot injun pontificating on how best to save “muh democracy” or the toll Whiteness takes on their psyche – F them.  My colored fatigue meter is off the scale.

            I’m tired of them all too.  There’s hardly any white people left and the ones I see have blue hair, beards and wear dresses.
Just recently my formerly affluent hood had yet another cultural enriching moment thanks to diversity.  A neighbor had his garage open mid day for an hour and one of the vibrants got caught on camera walking in and stealing their sons bike.
They just can’t help it, no matter how old or what kind of environment, the lack of impulse control and delayed gratification takes over.  What an insufferable virus the blax are.

        The secret of the Left’s success is that they neutered the charge of hypocrisy.From that, all else flows. Hypocrisy requires an external standard, and Leftism explicitly denies there’s any kind of “standard” at all — there is simply History, comrade, which is the inexorable working-out of the fundamental logic of the universe itself.Better, it neuters any possible objections to Leftism, since none of us live up to our own standards, simply because we can’t. How can wemorallyobject to Leftism, when we fall so far short in our own lives? Yet they are free to make “moral” arguments, because while we are fallen creatures who can never live up to our moral standards in this life, they are simply at a different point on History’s inescapable timeline. “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone” works on us, because we know we are sinners. It doesn’t work on them, because they’re certain that what looks like “sin” is only a necessary part of the Dialectic, comrade. Calling a particular Leftist action “racist” is like calling gravity “racist” — it’s a category error.

            The other part of that is that they weight their morality to have infinite value, such that they can always use the greater good argument no matter how vile their own actions.  Better to slaughter a thousand innocent men than let one guilty one drop an n-bomb.The odd thing is that the cattle go along with it, but I suspect it’s that they never see the extreme ends of unprincipled unrestricted power-seeking and are too illiterate to read from historical examples like the French Revolution or the Bolsheviks.  They know Hitler is the devil because of the English Patient shooting Jews from his balcony in Raiders of the Lost Ark, but when you point out Stalin or Mao being worse they just stare at you with their dead soulless uncomprehending eyes.

                Which suggests a good tactic for defeating them, at least locally. Instead of the Benedict Option, call it the “Bartleby Option,” after Melville’s scrivener. “I prefer not to.”That’s it. Nothing else. For the Left, the reaction is the result. They can’t do anything if you don’t react. It fries their circuits. They have a million dialed-to-eleven moral arguments to make if you try to actually answer the question “Why won’t you let women into your club?” But if you just shrug and say “I prefer not to,” they’ve got nothing.It won’t work on the macro level — we’re not voting our way out of this, so we sure as hell aren’t *talking* our way out of it — but on the local level it will drive them absolutely insane, and what is best in life?

            I think you can discern that in the quite popular notion that history has a “side.” This is a weird ontology of history anthropomorphically picking winners and losers, common to humans across eras. The Republican promotion of the Ukraine war is more disgusting than the liberals’ crass fight-for-universal-gay-marriage agenda IMO. A lot of well-heeled random individuals have their own incentives to maintain the Eastern Europe globalism flophouse, which is not an ideological thing, but that is so remote from the practical daily concerns of anybody this side of the Atlantic that I do see why liberals are inspired more by a conceit less mercenary (for the bulk of them) as Max LGBT. The Republicans like “Trey Gowdy” on Fox Entertainment News yesterday try to counter the moralism with, to my ears, laughably weak propositions of “Putin is a bad guy” and “American prestige is on the line.” You mean it’s not on the line from the ongoing drag queen bonanza? Saudi Arabia dumped us because we weren’t prestiging hard enough in the Middle East? This is just counterfeit deontology for non-progressives to cosplay with. It hurts psychologically for them to be cast outside the left morality-sphere.

                    South Carolina Vichy Republicans is a great study of how the national party leaders ensure that white South Carolinians are effectively left without actual leadership. Pinhead Trey, Tim The Magic Negro, Miss Lyndsay and Former Governor Ganges are the designated “leaders” to ensure that the evil spirits of Strom Thurmond, Andrew Pickens, Preston Brooks , and John Calhoun are exorcized and never allowed to infect white South Carolinians.

                        Democrats should run a tranny against Graham and force the GOP to prove the Dems are the real transphobes for putting an openly gay senator at risk.

        “It is also why suburban white people have been so slow to break from conservatism, despite getting little in the way of practical accomplishments. Conservative creedalism provided a vision of the future and validation for the present. Suburban white people, seeing nonwhites repeat lines from the creed was validation, but also presented a vision of a future in which everyone lived like Americans. Our ways were not just tradition or custom, but a template for all mankind.”Quite interesting passage here in light of My Lovely 🥰 Lady and my experience this past weekend. We had to return to Silly-nois for a memorial service for a family member. This relative was a pastor at a church in the southwestern suburbs of Chicagoland, DuPage county specifically.Election time is in the air in Silly-nois and the election signs sprout from the ground like dandelions. I notice the signs as I’m driving along and unnoticed by me, so does M’Lady. At one point as we’re driving through Naperville, IL, she turns to me and asks “Have you noticed anything, um,oddabout the candidate signs here and down by our cousins?”I reply “Sure, 75 – 80% of them are either Indian or Arabic names.”Now Naperville, for those who aren’t familiar, was for a long time the kind of suburb that could host a John Hughes 1980s comedy. White bread, middle to upper-middle class, quiet and mainly safe. I wouldn’t say no crime, but the kind of place folks like my parents fled to from Chicago proper.So I’m looking at these signs and realizing the squishy headed liberals, like say my sis, will punch the ticket for these folks and get the Blessings of Diversity Good And Hard as we say. Because I know the folks who are moving out to Naperville and the other Collar County suburbs. Worked with them all over Chicagoland. And they care not one whit for the folks who settled the suburbs and built them up and have no real interest in in becoming “Americans”. Hyphen Americans, sure, remembering their preceding the hyphen roots and culture.And they’re Gonna Get Theirs, no doubt. And for the folks who keep saying “IF you JUST cut Cook County off from Illinois it’d be Red”, nope.

            mmack- It’s not just Naperville.  In the Northwest suburbs of Chicago, same thing, ubiquitous political signs with Indian or Arabic names.  In the past you’d see it occasionally, but not this many.  It’s astonishing how many there are.

                Oh I know. We went from Will through Cook and into DuPage Counties and saw anywhere from 50 – 80% of the signs bearing Indian and Arabic names.
Literal signs of the time. In Aurora, IL there are sections of the city where the only English signage you’ll see are the street and traffic signs. Supermercados anyone?

            In ’89 I was in Wheaton for a wedding (the rehearsal dinner was in Naperville.)  Made it back for a visit in 2017 and I was shocked at the change. I grew up in the MA equivalent. The thing is, poorly run, corrupt states like IL and MA have been losing their heritage populations and almost all population growth is from foreign immigration.

                Our trip back was the first for me in nearly two years. The last one sadly was for my mother’s funeral, and as I said this was for a memorial service. Many things struck me as signs Ill-annoy is in decline:– The Illinois State Police were out in force on the highways and pulling people over. Some folks would say “Good, they’re enforcing the law”. That tells me the state is broke.(I kid, I read Wirepoints.org to keep tabs on goings on in the state. I KNOW the state is broke.)– Many longtime businesses in DuPage county are gone. Riding up Ogden Avenue, aka “Dealer’s Row” after all the car dealers that locate there, I noted four different dealerships that I’d either shopped at or bought cars from are gone or going out of business:1) The Naperville Ford dealer my mother bought her sole Ford from in the 1980s, and where I bought my first new car from in the very late 1990s is gone, replaced by an Amazon Fresh that didn’t seem to have many cars in the lot. It’s 50/50 if the original dealer’s Lincoln/Ford dealership further north on Ogden is still in business.2) The Subaru dealer across the street that weathered Oldsmobile being discontinued had an empty lot and an empty dealership store.3) The Mitsubishi dealer where I bought a used Mustang back in 2016 is bulldozed gone, an empty lot.4) The Downers Grove Ford dealer is goodness knows what now. A used car store, a ride share place, who knows?There’s a greasy spoon bar M’Lady and I stopped in at separately before we met that was closed down when I last visited two years ago. Place still sits boarded up two years later.In addition, we saw multiple stores closed and an entire shopping mall closed and boarded up with exactly zero stores open in it.Finally while breweries are still doing a bang-up business mostly, restaurants don’t even seem to be half full. Nor it appears are trendy places like wine or whiskey bars. Especially on Friday or Saturday nights.– Any new businesses seem to be of dubious economic value. Lots of new vape shops, psychic readings, little ethnic restaurants, nail salons (how many freaking nail salons do women really need?) and aforementioned craft breweries. I mean, I like breweries, but do you need one on EVERY block? (Residents of Wisconsin PLEASE don’t answer that, that’s one of them ‘rhetorical’ questions you betcha)– The houses in the older parts of “nicer” towns (Naperville, Downers Grove, Lisle, etc.) seemed a little more threadbare and worn down. Fading paint, cracked and rotting wood, missing shingles, loose siding, older (I mean 15-20-25 year old) cars and trucks clustered out front, and apartment complexes that looked even older and dingier than when I was living and working there over half a decade ago. The Lovely 🥰 Mrs. noticed it too and commented on it.There are still pockets where if you have the cash you don’t notice it but coming back after years away and remembering what it was, I noticed it.

                    The world has enough breweries, yes, but in my neck of the woods the Senecas have opened up a stunning amount of dispensaries on their rez.  It’s horrible what all this legal weed is doing to an already economically depressed area.  I guess this is revenge for all the fire water and smallpox blankets.
At least breweries are a traditionally white business.

                    Somebody was defending boomers on the last post because they were too young to vote for the 1965 immigration act, laying the blame on the greatest generation.  Then Milo said the same thing in his telegram…  To be clear, the majority of nonwhite immigrants came here in the last 35 years, about 50 fucking million to be approximate.  I don’t blame anyone here, and I love my old man, but boomers in politics had plenty of time to notice this.  Only the millennials figured it out via the internet.  After a decade in california, i moved back to the midwest and was surprised to see 5’6, 40 year old guatemalen men working the jobs that highschool white kids would work over summer, like landscaping and basic day labor jobs.  Sickening.

            mmack, my sister and some of her friends fled Portland, Oregon because their beliefs ruined that city.  They relocated to a poor, unsuspecting town in rural Oregon.That town is full of Trump supporters and my sister and her friends hate them, in spite of the fact that they were forced to flee to that town of Trump supporters to escape the results of their own beliefs.My sister and her friends have learned nothing and I don’t think that they are unusual.For reasons like this, I think that any town ought to have the right to refuse any new person who wants to settle there.Fvck individual freedom when it conflicts with preserving a people.

                Portlanders are totally incapable of connecting their voting habits with what happened to Portland.  Despite the fact that it’s thugs yelling BLM slogans while smashing every window downtown, or all junkies in the tents after they legalized drugs, it’s incomprehensible to them why all the shops are gone and there’s now a nightly listing of murders on the local news.
The soft, pear-shaped white soyboys waddle or ride their fancy bicycles over the river to safer pastures in Vancouver, but the bums and nigs will be following them soon enough once they vote in their dumb beliefs.

                This is the sad fate of rural areas in hard Blueshit states like Oregon. Right wing Oregonians tired of the Leftism are typically upset about two things, cultural rot (i.e. crime, homeless people and hypodermic needles on the streets) and specific government policies like Measure 114 (gun and magazine ban) and mail-in voting. Leftist Oregonians sometimes still have a bit of common sense and desire for self preservation and feel threatened by the former aspect of Leftist areas (the cultural rot).Since you can only escape *one* of those problems by moving, from say, Portland to The Dalles, the internal migrants to the rural areas are overwhelmingly Leftist. The rightists are just leaving the whole state. That’s my plan as well.This is probably what’s also driving the Greater Idaho movement (https://www.greateridaho.org/) which has gotten so popular they are even running commercials on YouTube for it! The rural counties in Oregon want to leave the state too. I support their efforts but personally, I don’t have any roots here and would rather just head back to The South.

                LineInTheSand,I feel for you. I dated a gal, K, who was born and raised in Portland, OR and crossed my path when she moved out to work in Naperville. She was a very pretty woman and fun to be with but I noticed she seemed goofy 🤪 and silly 🙃 for a gal her age (30). As in immature goofy.We broke up and years later I saw the TV showPortlandiaand it clicked. Googling years after that I saw she remarried and had children with her second husband but moved right back to Portland. I can’t even fathom what living in Portland with Antifa and all the other crap going on would be like.I wish her well but she and your sister will never really wake up. 😒

        In this age of clowns, when you get your money for nothing and your grindr dates for free, go woke go broke is just wishful thinking. But go woke go broke may not have been wrong. It may just have been early. If and when the free money spigot dries up, when tangible value must be produced in order to prosper, then go woke go broke becomes reality. Indications are that we are moving in the direction of that new era. That’s my optimism for today. If you can call it optimism, because that shift will bring a world of pain. But some of the pain it will bring will be the evaporation of the DIE and ESG edifices.Credit where due: The Firearms Act of 1934 notwithstanding, the conservative movement did subsequently manage to grow a backbone about gun rights so that we could retain the ones we still have. Else they’d have been gone long ago if the progressives had their way.

This is why Jerome Powell’s Presidency is so fundamentally important to the future of the White Race &amp; Western Civilization &amp; Christianity.
Every time Jerome Powell raises interest rates, more of our Enemy’s financial empire crumbles and vanishes, and our Enemy comes closer to ruin &amp; extinction &amp; damnation.
PRAY FOR THE PHYSICAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY AND THE MORAL PUGNACIOUSNESS OF JEROME POWELL!!!!!

                It will at the very least be a self imposed handicap in the competition against entities which care not for such nonsense. In the hypothetical world where the free money is gone.
There’s a grimmer possible scenario in which AINO goes on as a banana republic dystopia worshipping wokeness while the rest of the world just kind of ignores it. In that hypothetical, the competition it is losing against would be without its “borders,” not within them. There are a lot of unknowns involved with predicting how long that state of affairs could go on.

            A lot of what people call the “free market” is a highly gerrymandered system designed to keep masses of really quite useless people employed in paid work. I’ve made the point here many times that the average woman, objectively, is FAR worse at physical tasks than the average man and slightly worse at mental ones but with a dash of hormonal insanity that men don’t have. Yet, somehow, the statistics show women out earning men in the younger cohorts. What are they being paid for?Mostly, they are being paid to keep them off the streets (sometimes literally) and in the malls. The establishment realizes that in a “service economy” virtually no one actually produces anything useful or necessary. The goods people need are provided by long established trade arrangements with countries like China that actually do make useful things. It costs very little for the system to hook yet another dumb little camgirl into a makework job in government or corporate HR and this contributes, for the moment, to social stability.It also costs companies nothing to virtue signal with DIE policies and “sustainability” initiatives. These things don’t hurt productivity because no one is producing anything to begin with. In this sense the egalitarians are probably right. Women and men, Blacks, Whites, Asians… all are just as good at sitting on their asses in a cubicle and collecting a check.If we ever need to make our own stuff or invent new things and processes… then woke might well equal broke. The day can’t come soon enough.

                The only big difference between our current system and a UBI system is the amount of free time a whole lot of folks have on their hands. Which must be important to the establishment, since they went to the trouble of creating jobs for all these people.You can see why they aren’t impressed by talk of creating jobs. Since they do that themselves all the time. Either with your money or with money they printed out of thin air. Allowing them to believe they are telling the truth when they say “you didn’t build that.” Since that’s their economic frame of reference.

                It’s theoretically possible [although not likely, but at least theoretically possible] that the Chinese or the Streetsh!tters could win a war of attrition.In general, defensive wars can only possibly be won via attrition [there’s simply not enough serendipity*** in this universe to allow for any winning defensive strategy other than attrition].Sooner or later, if White people want to win, then we’ll have to abandon defensive attrition in favor of offensive conquest.We don’t have the excess population necessary to play the attrition games which the Chinese &amp; the Streetsh!tters can play.Nor do we have the correct personalities for playing the Attrition Game.And now this line of thought must end prematurely, in deference to Fed-Poasting standards.===============PS: If the White Race were slightly smarter than a bag of rocks [which apparently we are not], then we would be setting the Streetsh!tters &amp; the Chinese at one-anothers’ throats.===============***PPS: Praying for serendipitous cyclones off the west coast of Ireland isn’t a serious long term survival strategy.https://tinyurl.com/bdd8a6rm

                        The Spanish did not share your view of it being about Irish farts:On the authority of the Duke of Parma, “The English regarded their victory with modesty, and were languidly indifferent to their valour.” They looked upon the defeat of the Spanish Navy as a token of the Ruler of all things being decidedly partial to the Protestant faith. The Spaniards, as a whole, would not allow that Heaven was against them or that the verdict was that of Providence. They declared that it was entirely the result of the superior management of the English ships and the fighting quality of their crews. With this chivalrous testimonial no one could then or will now disagree. It was very sporting of them to admit the superiority of the British ships and seamanship.

        ‘Humans are believing machines’Believing machines with God-given souls, yes.  Spiritual war is war conducted chiefly in the mind, whether of individual or collective.   Human males are believing machines, made outta dirt, with God’s spirit (pneuma) ‘breathed’ into them.  Females are the dirt without the pneuma.  :O)‘The way to defeat the prevailing orthodoxy is by presenting an alternative moral order with a vision of the future that promises salvation for the intended audience.’Right.  And that’d be Scriptural Christianity, something quite different from Modern Christianity or Churchianity.Hmm better make that Militant Scriptural Christianity, for time being.The problem is not of systems or of correct ideology, but of irreversible spiritual entropy endemic to this planet and to human nature and human beings.  Under such conditions I don’t seek to win wars, only establish beachheads for the upcoming permanent resolution.How soon God effects that resolution isn’t my business, maybe He will do it once all the chaff gathers itself together in a nice convenient pile.

            That is the hope.  If the Bible teaches anything, it is that God is forgiving and patient, but he allows people to experience the error of their ways before acting.  In that understanding, I suspect we have a ways to go before redemption.

                Compsci —Bible’s always talking about how few pass through, needle’s eye, remnant this and portion that.  Christianity is an elite religion, by the mouth of Christ Himself.So I look for no collective redemption but make Him as available to this world as I can, and the hoss drinks or not.As you said, yes there’s a ways to go with Lucy Fer’s festivities, but the promise to remove the Church of Brotherhood prior to the full-on Tribulation is intact and guaranteed.  (Rev. 3:10; 1 Thess. 4:16-17)The King will make good on this promise, and soon.  He is very much looking forward to it.BTW the Hebrew word for ‘time of trouble’ (Tribulation) is ‘time of female vexation’ meaning the period just prior to Parousia is a time ruled by the tsah-rah, the female ‘spirit of vexation’ cited in Daniel 12:1.The socio-political expression of the tsah-rah demon is institutional feminism.  IOW, it is a ‘woman who rides the beast’.

I would be very careful about conflating “Spirit” and “Mind”.

        Generally speaking, an “alternate moral order” that begins to gain traction is given another name by the regime.  Terrorists.  Especially dying, decaying regimes that thrash about. The next gateway of history that this country will soon be walking through.  This is why the word very old word,  “sedition” has been dusted off in the last year, which applies to “alternate moral orders” that haven’t gained traction.The hippies of the 1960’s, the wild eyed Hillary Clintons, were seditious, and now in power as state terrorists.  Yet they were never labeled as either, because the state was strong and solid.  Now that they’ve weakened the place to near collapse, you can expect the opposite treatment that they received in their march through the institutions.  It will not be a march through them but around them…

            That is the beauty of a revived Church Militant. Less “novel alternate moral order” and a lot “just the normal default order.” Most people are close to or identify as Christian. Everyone celebrates Christmas and Easter. It also has a built in and well-entrenched moral basis: you aren’t anti-Christ, are you? It comes with an effective (and true!) moral dichotomy: those who oppose God are by definition evil and satanic. This is a also a fundamental strand of all White American ethnicities; even for the Yankee (who lets be honest is probably going to hell)  God = Good, and God’s opponents are definitionally evil.  There is a reason baphomet is a tranny, and why pictures of that demon are riding the meme tradewinds after the Anti-Christ Tranny Attack of 2023. “You’re trying to be like Satan” is pretty much a hard jab to the kidneys, even in current year.The amount of support you can drum up for “opposing those radical Christians” is very weak compared to their more favored epithets. There is also a LOT of deadweight momentum in the system for protection of religion, which sows chaos in the ranks when TPTB attempt to counterattack. The little despots dont know how to run the normal suppression routine, and frequently get it wrong and anger the griller mouthbreathers.

                The Christian frame, in addition to being true and robustly predictive, also has the effect of casting any opponents (into an eternal lake of fire, ahem) as ridiculous: if the modern ‘murican hears an argument is Satanist, they think of some loser at Hot Topic listening to marylin Manson. Kinda the antithesis of a serious person.

            Just in case there are some who don’t know, TRS guys are from The Right Stuff (dot biz),  where they have formed a party, The National Justice Party (NJP).  It sounds like it’s growing, with events held every few months, along with real life activism in Waukesha, Fargo, Akron, East Palestine, etc.  Their platform is light years away from Rush Limbaugh-style conservatism.

        Conservatism became useless after Reagan’s 1984 victory and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Tax cuts and defeating communism were its main planks, with the pro-life and cultural stuff as glosses. Immigration hardly was noticed, let alone debated. The old jalopy should have been sent to the junk yard, but by then the grift was on with the neocons in the driver’s seat.

            Conservatism never shifted to making war upon the internal enemies, the liberals, the left.  It just wanted an endless victory parade for the end of the cold war and see the libs as just fellow citizens with mistaken beliefs we should respect because we all share the same ends as good Americans.
The ends were not the same.  The respect was never returned.
The Left is/was/always making war upon the right in the most ruthless manners possible.  In the courts, media, the schools, the streets, you name it.

        As the Regime pivots from street violence to outright targeted oppression, what comes next is first survival and then reaction. Those nice White folks in suburbia now have to deal with hostile ferals in their midst and an increasingly poor quality of life on the economic, social and cultural fronts. Ridiculous shibboleths about equality are hard to swallow when a person is routinely treated unfairly. Yes, that happens now, but it is about to be amped up to 11.Transgenderism, anti-racism, and other absurdities are, to quote others, luxury beliefs, and luxury is leaving the building. Fear and deprivation initially make people easier to control but over time undermine systems and societies. Include conservatism and the Republican Party as luxury beliefs as their impotence become undeniable and unbearable.What comes next is a Normie unable to submit per usual. Many if not most will not thrive and perhaps perish, and the number of those who do not submit and agree to be destroyed will determine whether the Regime thrives or falls. I have become increasingly convinced it will be the latter because the failure of Normie’s dogma has been so swift and spectacular that it has become difficult to use as a pacifier.

        I agree that the hierarchical nature of Catholicism stunted, to a degree, the radical egalitarianism inherent in the religion.  However, note that Protestantism took off as soon as (1) Aristotle was reintroduced into the west by Muslims (almost all of his works were burned and destroyed by Christians prior to that) combined with (2) the invention of the printing press which allowed the masses to read the bible without relying on priests.  After that, the Unitarian strain of Protestantism took over the universities and dropped the belief in God as a way to outcompete their religious competition in an environment favoring separation of Church and State (as Moldbug has argued conclusively, imo).I have plenty of respect for both Jesus’s message against the Pharisees where intent mattered as much as or more than action itself, as well as for what Catholicism accomplished, but it doesn’t mean you have to look at the issue as a sports match of your team vs. the other team (something the vast majority of people are inclined to do).  One can look at an issue and see nuance and subletry.NF

            Aristotle wasn’t “burned and destroyed” by the Church. That’s completely ridiculous. John Damascus relied heavily on Aristotle for his anthropology, among other things, ditto the other fathers of the Eastern Church.

                Hi Enoch, please see here, although you should be able to find backup with any number of sources:https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/culture-magazines/rediscovery-aristotle“Owing to vagaries of history, the complete body of Aristotle’s writings was lost to the Latin West. The only bits and pieces available were a couple of treatises on logic, a discipline Aristotle invented, and some commentaries on those works: in particular, the Categories and the On Interpretation (the texts translated by Boethius, both collectively referred to as the “Old Logic”); the Topics of Cicero, and the Topical Differences of Boethius, together with the latter’s translation of Porphyry’s Isagoge (Introduction to the Categories) as well as his commentaries on the Isagoge, Categories, and On Interpretation. This is all that was known—directly and indirectly—of Aristotle’s enormous contribution until the twelfth century. The same was not the case in the Muslim world. As part of the plunder from their conquest of much of the Mediterranean region, the Arabs fell heir to the Aristotelian corpus that had been recorded on scrolls that were in the hands of Nestorian Syrians (a heretical Christian sect). The Muslim conquerors quickly translated these works into Arabic. The pagan Aristotle subsequently became, as it were, the “house philosopher” of Muslim intellectuals, and it is not too much of an exaggeration to say that to philosophize for a Muslim between the ninth and the twelfth centuries was in large measure to comment on the works of the Philosopher (as he was called). The view that was widely held was that one could not go beyond Aristotle in matters of reason.”

                    Wasn’t Aquinas an Aristotelian? Hundreds of years before Reformation. And Cicero’s impact was because of Petrarch’s discovery — founding the humanism that would educate Luther in Wittenberg. I believe this may be an example of publications “brown-washing” history. Now, I do not disagree that Muslims probably inherited some of Aristotle’s works, but I would suggest that the quotation you provided even has that smell of fishy logic (“It is not too much of an exaggeration”).

                Hi davidcito, the blame for the burning of the library of Alexandria (which meant different events and at different times) is disputed, see here:
https://ehistory.osu.edu/articles/burning-library-alexandria
Also, if you want to learn about the extensive and deliberate destruction of the pagan world by Christians, please see this book:

        Remember, for decades, lefties believed they could take in foreigners and “transform” them into good Americans too. As opposed to just believing in the DoI harder, though, they did it with social engineering, through pop culture, affirmative action, the education system, etc. Of course, this was far more effective as it guarantees that the sons and daughters of hardworking immigrants become brainless lefty revolutionaries with a chip on their shoulder. That illegal Mexican might be willing to work 14 hours a day washing cars in LA but his kids will be “Chicano Studies” majors at Cal State supporting the Mexican Reconquista. So while the conservatives were claiming MLK Jr. was AKSHULLY a conservative, the left has been building up generations of shock troops. Failure at every level. Of course the powerful got what they wanted, which was destruction of the United States as a country of European peoples and a permanent revolution.Even in spite of it all, the cons still cling to creedalism, possibly because the alternative is too horrible to contemplate. But it’s really not. The alternative is Christianity, which was our moral order for 2000 years and worked pretty well. Of course, Christianity has become completely hijacked in the US, and has been for a long time with the Scofield Bible, Americanism, Moral Majority types, etc. A lot of work is necessary, but until people understand the eternal and spiritual element of this conflict they cannot understand what is going on.

            Knee-jerk rejection of Christianity is not helpful.Digust with converged churches and the scorn heaped on the Catholic Church is fully justified.Ask yourself, however: do you want to live in a world of Ned Flanders?  Or in secular Georgetown, Cabrini Green/ East LA or little Tel Aviv?Let Ned’s children waste their resources flying/ driving / digging wells in Haiti / Africa.  Convert the heathens.   God speed.But leave Haiti for the Hatians and leave America for Americans.  Christianity acknowledges that there are different nations in this world.Added bonus: an organized church has the benefit of enjoying tax-exempt status…

                I don’t think so, since it’s helpful to understand the origins of our present malaise, and thus understand why it happened and how to avoid in the future.But I’m a historicist and to each his own rant, friendo; human evil and stupidity remains a constant; only the color of the lipstick changes, and the Lincoln/Jaffa cult is particularity interesting given it’s the foundational lie of the Duhmerican polity. It’s also personally interesting to me, as a Southerner; it is my family history in a way that’s probably beyond the existential grasp of your average Duhmerican mutt, who are more obsessed with “principle” rather than blood and soil.“Concern, leading to action, this millennium.” Like what?

                And there is also fact that the Globohomo regime has elected to prioritize the destruction/desecration of Confederate/Southern memory. AP Hill, Nathan Bedford Forrest, and others.

                We have got to know from where we came to get to where we need to be. You obviously aren’t Southern or at least not someone who had ancestors in the CSA. For many of us the war defines just where we stand as supposed Americans. The South was always second class to the Puritan north mostly because we just wanted to be left alone and not have to deal with them.The north treated the South and Southerners worse than any vanquished foe in the war-making history, over 200 years of war, of the US. The commandant of the camp at Andersonville was hung after the war but mortality rates were just as high at Yankee prison camps. They had food and medicine for prisoners and the South didn’t but we were the losing side so we got to pay and still are paying.I pretty much hate this country and have for a long time. It’s not now and never really was my country.

                    A lot of such could also have been avoided with prisoner swaps.  South offered, North refused.  Better to sacrifice Northern prisoners than give needed troops back to the South.  Hell, even Russian and Ukraine are swapping prisoners.

                        Yes – Grant and Lincoln both forbade prisoner swaps in 1864 as that would return troops to Lee’s army. They didn’t give a shit about their Irish/German conscripts. They also would not permit the South to send medicine to their troops at Elmira or Point Lookout.

        The Z Man’s closing comment about defeating the prevailing orthodoxy with an alternative morality and a vision of the future reminded me of the many times this has been tried, but unfortunately failed (or at least not succeeded yet).  The foremost example would be the Northwest Front movement of the late Harold Covington.  He wrote a series of “Northwest Novels” that illustrated, in great depth, precisely an alternative morality and a future built upon that morality.  The various efforts promoting white ethnostates over the years offer a similar approach; Greg Johnson’s many books, conferences, and articles on the topic being a fine example.  None of these movements seems to have (as of yet) achieved much real-world impact, at least outside of a relatively small group of dissidents.  Furthermore, it has been my experience that “normies” are less receptive to lofty moral arguments and forward-thinking plans, but instead respond positively to short, pithy critiques of the current system.  An example of this is the old Bob Whitaker slogans or mantras: “Why is diversity only a problem in white countries? Why doesn’t anybody seem to worry about diversity in Nigeria?”I hope the Z Man will expand on his thoughts in today’s excellent article, perhaps with some commentary on why past formulations of alternative moralities have to date failed (such as that advanced by Harold Covington for example), and why present formulations (such as the white ethostate promoted by Greg Johnson), have met with such limited success given the glaring problems in our current society that have, since at least the end of segregation if not before, only become more exacerbated and obvious with each passing year.  Did these alternative moralities fail simply because of timing? Do living conditions need to approach starvation levels before people are responsive to the type of changes being discussed here (e.g. the New Deal was only possible because of the Great Depression)?

They do. Even then most will remain delusional. I increasingly think the Regime may have gone too far, too fast, but even then the number who will react will not be great. Even then it may be enough to overturn the applecart, though.

                By all reasonable lights, our people should be marching in the streets by the millions in DC and state capitols because of the Trump and Mackey show trials, yet we don’t do sweet Fatty Arbuckle. I’m now utterly convinced that our people are permanently supine. Their testicles, and with them their survival instinct, have been machined away by decades of anti-white/pro-negro propaganda.There are only two hopes for survival. First, central authority decays and collapses under the weight of its own irrationality, which allows white peripheral areas to effectively become autonomous. Second, the GAE becomes embroiled in war with a peer nation, which lays waste to AINO and liquidates the current Power Structure. Obviously, the first alternative is preferable, although any alternative may be better than continued oppression by our lovely pomofascists.

                        By any means necessary, I suppose, but it seems to me that if central authority weakens dramatically, the GAE won’t have the political wherewithal to project military force onto a peer nation.

                    By all appearances, both alternatives you presented are running neck and neck in the race for which may lay claim to first prize in the final destruction of AINO sweepstakes.In any case, in tandem and left unchecked, it’s a lead pipe cinch these scenarios will to lead to AINO collapse.Whether a white periphery can rise from the ash heap remains to be seen.(BTW – can’t recall a time I’ve seen Sweet Fatty Arbuckle invoked – tho’ it is more colorful than most other…options).

            A recent defeat in the attempt to establish an alternative morality occurred this past week when a Trump appointed Federal Judge blocked the Tennessee state law that defined drag queen shows as adult caberet and therefore adults only “entertainment”. This shows that there will be no meaningful change by working within the system. Even you do manage to get some politicians on your side it only takes one activist judge to block all progress.

            Not so sure if living conditions need to become dire, but the power of centralized government needs to be weakened (which will likely result in the dire living conditions).  It would take that type collapse for a thousand Oranias to bloom.  Right now, any budding Orania is cut down by the force of government and its erstwhile various busybody NGO hangers-on.

            There is no such thing as “alternative morality.” The very term partakes of the ridiculous modern notion that morality is pliable, that you could just swap out one moral module and replace it with another one more to your liking.
Morality is real. That which is moral is moral because it is rooted in the logos-structure of reality. There is no changing that. There is only either declining from it or growing in resemblance to it.

        The most damaging ideological canard is the notion that we can talk or vote our way out the mess we’re in. Yes, in a perfect world, persuasion based upon rational sanity would rally enough votes to elect better politicians and thereby right the ship of state. But the reality is that DC is (and has been) infested with crooks and idiots for over a century now and the Fortified for Democracy movement insures that it will only get worse going forward. Most Americans are still very comfortable in their relative high standard of living, so maintaining the status quo is preferable to facing the hardship of a collapse. Consequently, voting harder is here to stay until the proverbial 2×4 upside the head occurs. So what to do?First, plan &amp; act so as to survive the collapse. There is no downside to these efforts. Second, use your intelligence to anticipate future events and have contingency plans in place to effectively deal with these developments should they arise. Third, use your analytical skills to precisely identify the root causes that have gotten us into this mess in the first place. That is where the remedy should be focused. Fourth, recognize that the road to redemption will be a difficult journey that requires diligent effort and dedication. The goal should be to effect a remedy with least pain and collateral damage to innocents. That is the real “moral high ground.”Smarter, not harder.

        The core of the issue you are discussing is society’s continual push toward egalitarianism, which is rooted in Christianity itself.  Historian Tom Holland articulated this point in his book “Dominion”:“The more years I spent immersed in the study of classical antiquity, so the more alien I increasingly found it.  The values of Leonidas, whose people had practiced a particularly murderous form of eugenics and trained their young to kill uppity Untermenschen by night, were nothing that I recognized as my own; nor were those of Caesar, who was reported to have killed a million Gauls, and enslaved a million more.  It was not just the extremes of callousness that unsettled me, but the complete lack of any sense that the poor or the weak might have the slightest intrinsic value.  Why did I find this disturbing?  Because, in my morals and ethics, I was not a Spartan or a Roman at all.  That my belief in God had faded over the course of my teenage years did not mean that I had ceased to be Christian.  For a millennium and more, the civilization into which I had been born was Christendom.  Assumptions that I had grown up with – about how a society should properly be organized, and the principles that it should uphold – were not bred of classical antiquity, still less of ‘human nature’, but very distinctively of that civilization’s Christian past.  So profound has been the impact of Christianity on the development of Western civilization that it has come to be hidden from view.  It is the incomplete revolutions which are remembered; the fate of those whose triumph is to be taken for granted.”If you want society to emphasis certain qualities of warrior energy inequality – nobility, hierarchy, immediacy, honor, greatness, strength, individuality – then there must be a Nietzschian transvaluation of values from priestly energy slave morality.That isn’t to say such a transvaluation has to be total.  In my opinion a balance between master and slave morality is needed, but it’s clear our society is fully lopsided in favor of slave / priest morality and it’s driving western civilization toward complete destruction.Without a transvaluation of values, you will always end up with Robert Lewis Dabny’s 1897 criticism of conservatism:https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FswVNA5aEAAa2jE?format=jpg&amp;name=largeNF

                Hi btp, I agree that the hierarchical nature of Catholicism stunted, to a degree, the radical egalitarianism inherent in the religion.  However, note that Protestantism took off as soon as (1) Aristotle was reintroduced into the west by Muslims (almost all of his works were burned and destroyed by Christians prior to that) combined with (2) the invention of the printing press which allowed the masses to read the bible without relying on priests.  After that, the Unitarian strain of Protestantism took over the universities and dropped the belief in God as a way to outcompete their religious competition in an environment favoring separation of Church and State (as Moldbug has argued conclusively, imo).I have plenty of respect for both Jesus’s message against the Pharisees where intent mattered as much as or more than action itself, as well as for what Catholicism accomplished, but it doesn’t mean you have to look at the issue as a sports match of your team vs. the other team (something the vast majority of people are inclined to do).  One can look at an issue and see nuance and subletry.NF

                    Anyone who imagines Christianity is radically egalitarian is not familiar with any NT writing. The reason St. Paul gets a bad rap these days is simply because of his emphasis on hierarchy.
And then there’s all those irritating things Jesus was saying about the last being first because the Lord can do whatever He wants.

In his 1928 tract “Commissary to the Gentiles: The First to See the Possibilities of War by Propaganda”, Marcus Eli Ravage, a Jew, makes the argument that Christianity was deliberately crafted as a weapon against Rome (later echoed by others such as Jewish historian Heinrich Graetz).  I will quote from it:“[Saul had] perceived, to begin with, how utterly hopeless were the chances of little Judea winning out in an armed conflict against the greatest military power in the world. Second, and more important, it came to him that the vagabond creed which he had been repressing might be forged into an irresistible weapon against the formidable foe. Pacifism, non-resistance, resignation, love, were dangerous teachings at home. Spread among the enemy’s legions, they might break down their discipline and thus yet bring victory to Jerusalem. Saul, in a word, was probably the first man to see the possibilities of conducting war by propaganda.He journeyed on to Damascus, and there to the amazement alike of his friends and of those he had gone to suppress, he announced his conversion to the faith and applied for admission to the brotherhood. On his return to Jerusalem he laid his new strategy before the startled Elders of Zion. After much debate and searching of souls, it was adopted. More resistance was offered by the leaders of the Ebionim of the capital. They were mistrustful of his motives, and they feared that his proposal to strip the faith of its ancient Jewish observances and practices so as to make it acceptable to Gentiles would fill the fraternity with alien half-converts, and dilute its strength. But in the end he won them over, too. And so Saul, the fiercest persecutor of Jesus’ followers, became Paul, the Apostle to the Gentiles. And so, incidentally, began the spread into the pagan lands of the West, an entirely new Oriental religion…[Paul’s idea] was at this stage purely defensive. He had as yet no thought of evangelizing the world; he only hoped to discourage the enemy. With that accomplished, and the Roman garrisons out of Palestine, he was prepared to call a truce. But the slaves and oppressed of the Empire, the wretched conscripts, and the starving proletariat of the capital itself, found as much solace in the adapted Pauline version of the creed as the poor Jews before them had found in the original teachings of their crucified master.”If you would like to read the whole thing, it’s short and only 8 pages, here it is:https://ia802201.us.archive.org/9/items/commissary-to-the-gentiles/Commissary%20to%20the%20Gentiles%20-%20Kike%20Ravage_text.pdf

                        “Anyone who imagines Christianity is radically egalitarian is not familiar with any NT writing.”
That’s simply not true.  You may be correct that the truth of Christianity is not radically egalitarian.  But in today’s time, most of the people who have read the New Testament think that it is, at least judging by what the clear majority of Christians say and how they act.

                        That is dumb analysis— Christianity is more than the words on some fragments and mistranslated scrolls that survived a few centuries in a buried jar somewhere in the desert. It had a real social context. It began as a religion for slaves in the Roman Empire. Soon after it became popular with senators’ wives.

                        This argument about Saul being and remaining  Pharisee through and through is why Friedrich Nietzsche characterized him as being the greatest disaster to befall Christianity (in his work, The Antichrist). Your acceptance of this as the governing impulse behind his “conversion” only adds weight to his insight. This scurilous and unprincipled Jevv, beavering away at turning the message of Jesus and his ministry to the evil ends of the Sanhedrin is frankly sickening. Nietzsche knew this, and this knowledge informed his critique of the  resulting “slave morality” of Pauline “Christianity” really requires to be understood.

                        Hi Ostei, sure.  The central factor for exiting the Middle Ages was that after more than 600 years, in the century between 1150 and 1250, the West recovered all of the major works of Aristotle.  This occurred as a result of increasing contacts with the culture of the Muslims, who had found a full copy of Aristotle’s works in a Syrian basement in the 600s — the most momentous archaeological discovery in history.  Once they were reintroduced by the West, they were translated from Arabic and other tongues into Latin, organized and systematized, and soon became widely known.  Aristotle’s writings struck the 13th century like a bombshell.  At first the Church banned Aristotle’s works outright because there was a violent contrast between the Church and Aristotlean understanding of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.  The better minds could not ignore Aristotle (or destroy the knowledge, as the Muslims possessed it), nor repudiate Christianity, and they struggled to come up with a reconciliation.  Thomas Aquinas had the best attempt with his Summa Theologica (1485) and his approach was ultimately adopted by the Church (but not officially until 1879), and it had profound significance. Aquinas advocated that man has some share in working out his own this-worldly destiny, that he ought to develop his rational powers and, as far as possible, enjoy his stay on earth. In constructing a Christian philosophy within an Aristotelian framework, he made Aristotelianism respectable and acceptable to the most advanced thinkers of the medieval world, which was the biggest factor in ending Christian persecution of reason and science.  This in turn opened the door to the Renaissance, which tore at the legitimacy of the Catholic Church and led to Luther and his 95 Theses.I am not a Randist, but Leonard Peikoff’s short lectures on this subject are very good:https://courses.aynrand.org/campus-courses/history-of-philosophy/the-dark-ages-medieval-scholasticism-and-the-rediscovery-of-aristotle/https://courses.aynrand.org/campus-courses/history-of-philosophy/thomas-aquinas-the-union-of-aristotelianism-and-christianity/https://courses.aynrand.org/campus-courses/history-of-philosophy/the-renaissance-and-the-protestant-reformation/

            While I like much of Holland’s work, my reaction to the study of classical antiquity was quite the opposite of his. Here was a world with values perfectly consonant with my own- a world which worshipped strength, virtue, honor and was consistent with biological reality. It was a world that made sense to me, unlike the current iteration. Yes, it could be cruel, but so is the lion from the perspective of the gazelle.

                That may be so, but Christianity as a religion was a huge memetic improvement over paganism, and that is why it eventually won.  By claiming that converts to Christianity were morally superior to Romans in the eyes of God so long as they believed in Christ (a slave equal or superior to the Emperor!), and by creating Heaven and Hell as a massive carrot and stick that pagan religions lacked (Hades wasn’t much of a motivator for anyone as everyone ended up there), with an all-seeing spying God that constantly watched and judged your every action, Paul created a supercharged spiritual bolshevism to challenge the foundation of Rome itself.  Polytheistic, pluralistic, decentralized Hellenism would have no chance against a universalist, equality-obsessed, intolerant religion which centralized power via regional Bishops (Julian the Apostate planned to centralize Hellenism to compete via the creation of provincial High Priests, but was likely murdered by a Christian soldier before he could).   Christianity had too many memetic evolutionary improvements over paganism not to eventually spread.

                    Certainly, paganism had no adequate answer for the Christian vision of salvation and its universal (catholic) dispensation. Also, by late antiquity, paganism had fallen far from its stoic roots into a debauched epicureanism that ceded the moral and ethical high ground to Christians.  No social order is permanent or incorruptible.
I do not gratuitously bash Christianity. Christian civilization had profound achievements,  but its germ of egalitarianism grew into the noxious weed of equalism, which now threatens to strangle all achievement, and the judgment by which it is recognized.

                        Christianity is strictly hierarchic.  Just because Lucy-fer and the Churchians down the centuries turned part of Christianihy to Jacobian egalitee invalidates neither Christ nor authentic Christianity.The abstraction and idol of Equality was born direct from the devil’s mind.  It is at least as old as Babylon, which practiced it between men and women.  Didn’t work out well for them either.Likewise, the Kingdom of Heaven is hierarchic.  Nothing to do with egalitee, which was and is the chosen ‘religion’ of goddess-worshippers.One time the apostles got squabbling about who was gonna sit at the King’s right hand, you know, tell us Boss who gets the seat of honor?  Me?  Me?  lolBut even the apostles knew that in the Kingdom, as on Earth, each has his or her place assigned by God, and it is frowned-upon to overthrow that hierarchy in service of satanic egalitarianism.  Why it’s almost like Eve/Woman wanting equality with God.  :O)BTW King Jeshua told the apostles that He didn’t know who sat in what seat at the Celebration Table.  The King said it was up to Father.  So once again, a demonstration of the hierarchy requisite to Christianity.

                Cruelty will always be there and comes in many forms.
All the left wing “niceness” has destroyed standards and quality, lead to countless murdered by street crime, broken families, STDs, endless mental problems, murdered babies, and now butchery of children’s genitals.
As always, the real question when it comes down to it is “Who, whom?” or who is to be master.

        “The way to defeat the prevailing orthodoxy is by presenting an alternative moral order with a vision of the future that promises salvation for the intended audience.”The American Evangelical movement never worked because the salvation it offered had no political traction. Or, its political traction was essentially libertarian – it accepted a separation of church and state and merely wanted to be left alone. A salvation idea that just wanted to grill out on weekends, really.The Left is good at Hovering up all the things Christians might think are sins these days – not fornication in any form, for sure, and certainly not greed and sloth. Greed is the Evangelical creed and sloth, well, the reason for all the Boomer hatred is because they never felt motivated to perform their duties toward their families. But racism, for sure, and sexism, and all the things the Left identifies as sins, your average American Christian believes are also sins. And they deliver salvation from those sins.The sins that got us here – avarice and sloth – are not recognized as sins by anybody on the conservative side. Conservatives monetized every bit of social capital the same as libs. Conservatives abandoned their families as much as libs (or was Rush Limbaugh the husband of one wife and father to several children, but I missed it?).That just gives some idea of the hopelessness of the project. Salvation? From what? We don’t have sins.

            As an attorney, I handled many child custody cases in the ’90s, and at the time I knew that nothing good would come of these children’s plight, their wellbeing ignored so Dad could cat around, or Mom could find herself.  It was horrifying to watch, all these people who did not care about the harm a broken home would visit on their kids.   They were usually already dumping them in daycare, so the kids were well on their way to feeling they didn’t merit an adequate amount of a parent’s attention, while living a life of regimentation that would make a Prussian soldier blush.  And we wonder why these young people are so messed up.The most selfish Wall Street baron is no match in cruelty for the parent who breaks up a home, short of being physically abused or suffering unbearable mental and emotional abuse that children should not be exposed to.

        What strikes me is the neat way that the one racially aware and very, very powerful white group in this country, white Southerners, were first betrayed by their party and leaders beginning in the 1950s and into the 1960s, then moving to create a solid voting bloc for the Republicans, who then, with the cult of Lincoln, made sure to betray white Southerners again in the 1970s to the present day. If there is one thread connecting American domestic political history since 1945 and the Roosevelt administration, it has been the successful effort of both political parties to take any real power from and ensure that white Southerners are never to lead this country for the benefit of white Southerners, while gleefully destroying their pride in themselves and the country their ancestors built. Lincoln’s Revenge, indeed.

            I’m not refuting anything you’re saying, yet I can’t help noticing how the country has become more Southern, in the sense of multiracial. Even the architecture— in the past few years ‘affordable housing’, i.e., condo complexes with carports, city diversity, white slobs. I remember seeing these things down south in the 90’s. Identity politics, civil war, neofeudalism (plantations), etc.That isn’t to say the South has risen again. Money and power might be relocating down there, but I don’t get the sense it’s a move by Southern elites. Rather, I imagine elites have figured out it’s an effective model to control society. In the short term. Long term, we have a good example of what happens. It’s just kind of happening, intentionally or not, because of the spirit of the thing.Of course the theme of imminent disaster goes with it, and it’ll probably go down that way without a major course correction. No surprise the fatalism, no surprise the cult of Lincoln, but I find it odd that Southerners would’ve joined a movement that is sort of fundamentally anti-Southern. Forgive my Northern tactlessness: you all might’ve lost a war, but you aren’t defeated.

                Southerners had no options open, once nominal Southern Democrats like Missouri’s Truman, or Texas’s Johnson turned Judas for their 30 pieces of silver and the chance to be President and betrayed their own people, while knifing segregationist white Democratic leaders like Strom Thurmond in the back, making them men without a party. They were refugees who had to join a party founded on the principle of bloody, muderous hatred of white Southerners as junior partners who, ever since, have had to swallow being the unwanted stepchildren of that party, and any white Southern politician in the Vichy Republican Party knows they are expected to play ball, not represent white Southerners, who they have been trained to have nothing but sneering contempt for, like Mitch McConnel and Miss Lyndsay Graham do.

                    Republicans were a northern, industrial party. Then the GD hit (or was engineered depending who you ask), and FDR led a political realignment. WWII, Great Migration, etc. No more Norman Rockwell paintings.It hasn’t gone well for the North, either, since then. Minus the blood, of course, but the cities are wrecked and huge swathes of countryside paved over, shuttered factories, people and ways of life dislocated. Done with debt instead of guns, and quietly. Blacks used against whites in both cases.Made for some strange bedfellows in the Republican Party, lol. It’s the financial power that done it imo, and money has no country.

                Yes, Bill Clinton was the quintessential white Southerner president.Cheap shots aside, I wouldn’t blame the South for white slobs. The whole school uniforms vogue of the 90s comes to mind (Bill campaigned on this), but not sure I’d blame the North either. The collapse in comportment may have been slower in the South, however, when one’s social life revolves around television, or today social media, it figures we’d grt dress egalitarianism, aka lowest-common-denominator wardrobe. I am middle aged and a city boy by upbringing. Now when I am in a globo-homo outpost like a Starbucks or a Target, and a man wearing a coat or a woman not wearing yoga pants enters the business, it’s jarring and feels like a movie plot set-up, similar sensation to 9/11 or the COVID zombie call-in-sick year of 2020. My theory is that mass immigration is the biggest accelerant of slobbishness because these peculiar dress customs are the hardest to translate across ethnic domains. The new Indian guy in England and the Muslim guy in Scotland are natty dressers, as is the gay Indian guy in Ireland.

                    There are white slobs everywhere lol. I was referring more to the condo complexes and the people who tend to live there. Saw them first in the South. Not that I necessarily think it’s an intrinsically Southern phenomenon, either, but it’s a way of building ‘communities’ that I first saw down there. And maybe they were doing it in New England, too, idk, but I think of northern burbs, and it’s single family homes or apartment buildings until recently.

        Reading about that artist from Austria lately and what struck me is that he was a decent organizer. The organization that he helped build was actually a parallel government and therefore when the time came the transition to a National Socialist government was not a transition into the unknown with institutions just no longer in place.Now granted in todays America our rulers are not going to let a completely parallel government exist but we have to find ways to build our own institutions of some kind.Maybe that’s just a local county government  for now, maybe we can salvage some states? We must homeschool, private school, or get control of our local  public schools. We need to build some local elites that can hire locals.It’s going to start with localism and community if we are to survive and build again.

            Oh I beg to differ. The left is already doing it, all of the “bad guy” units eg; burn loot and murder, pantifa, the alphabet people groups, peta, etc. they have a structure, philosophy, long-range plan and most importantly AN ENEMY. That’s us.I read a thread a while ago from someone writing on the “Jacobin” website and he laid out the lefts plan in detail. He didn’t name call, or anything like that, but he did pose a question to us, “If the government collapsed tomorrow, we have an alternative government waiting to go that can step into the breech and we’ve been constructing it for almost one hundred years. We can say to the average American that we can stabilize what is happening, can you make that same claim?”

                Isn’t that somewhat akin to, say, Sweden telling Russia that once the GAE dies they’ll still have the EU ready to step into the breach?
And do what?
The left has been able to build their parallel institutions because they all have the sanction and protection of the existing, all-powerful state.  If and when the current Dons andcaporegimesare liquidated, how sustainable will these parallel institutions actually be?  I don’t have the answer, but I suspect that maintaining them will likely be far more difficult without their current benefactors.

        I did a bit of looking into David Petraeus and his backing of the New North America. Shallow Patriotism was preyed upon by these types that decided we needed to build a weird China in order to compete with them.Our education system also failed miserably. The Declaration was a list of grievances made for the non-British Continental powers to grant the colonies rebellion legitimacy surrounded by propaganda to inspire the rebels to war and let them know that the elite were pledging their life to the cause. All men are created equal was a slight at hereditary monarchy/aristocracy and a preamble to the inequal application of justice and law between England and the colonies. It was about equality before the law. Turning it into an egalitarian creed is one of the great accomplishments of the media and one of the great academic failings of all time.I think presenting a template for this new platform to replace Creedalism is a great topic for a post or a show. It is time to put forth a proposal or two and make it work.The Regime’s war on white America provides ample places to build in practical platform planks. The hard part is going to be the more general, aspirational aspect of it. I suspect it a statement that America is fundamentally a civilization built upon ancient and modern European civilization and built by people of European descent. America is European and Western Civilization of and for its people.This puts a stake in the ground. This is what we say it is. If not, then it is illegitimate to our 200 million plus people. The regime has already declared it illegitimate. The book write and TV/Internet pundit class will then be forced to declare a side. They claim to be for Western Civilization, force them to claim for us or the other side. We also need one of our people to develop our Prager U. It is a travesty that Prager is providing an alternative education system for our people. We need to get moving. I suspect Middle Eastern power vassalage is just fine with the Prager/Shapiro group. We need to make that not good enough for our people.Just some thoughts. I would love to see you do a show on this.

        The Declaration was never intended to be a revolutionary egalitarian or inclusive document. To the contrary, it was a conservative document citing the rights of Englishmen from the Glorious Revolution of 1688.Sure, it mentions Locke’s natural rights, but the key phrase is “that to secure these rights, governments (PLURAL) are instituted among men.”In other words, other races and cultures have a natural right to institute governments to secure their rights according to their own circumstances. Jefferson was specifically trying to secure the rights of the English Bill of Rights, most of which later ended up the American Bill of Rights — freedom of speech and the press, jury trial, right to bear arms, etc.The biggest refutation of the Jaffa/Lincoln “creedal” thesis prioritizing the declaration is that Jefferson, the author of the Declaration, recommended in Notes on the State of Virginia (1781) that Negro slaves be repatriated or colonized and not admitted to the American body politic.

            It really doesn’t matter what it says, though. What matters is how it is used. In any case, the Declaration of Independence is not long for this country. A few hardcore lefties on college campuses have already put it out there – the document is a racist document written by a slaveowner and is no longer acceptable for our times. At some point the cultural commissars will declare this to be the new standard, as they have done so many other times. It won’t be taught and people who bring it up will be called racist. Instead we will learn about the true founding of this country, which will be some combination of the ADL, NAACP, Tulsa Black Wall Street, MLK Jr., etc. Conservatives, having fully bought into the left’s framing of such things, and always seeking leftist approval, will go along with it. It won’t be enough though, because any Jaffa acolytes will be cast out of polite company for writing in positive terms about the Declaration of Independence in the past.

            The US dollar as the world’s reserve currency has always been like water to a fish. No-one even bothers to understand or notice  that it is the only thing underpinning our corrupt Fed. When the British pound  collapsed, the Empire quickly collapsed. The strong, world supported dollar is no longer sustainable. Protection of property rights and stability of the rule of law made the strong dollar what it was. And those two principles are anathema to the current “ ruling” class

        Saying that the american conservative movement conserved nothing is wrong on a couple of accounts.Beginning with the nature of that movement.  It was always an alliance of several disparate groups – which can be seen as differing cultures.   The dissident right is mostly people who were from the “cultural conservative” camp – with roots stretching back to Scotts-Irish settlers in the 17th century.     The people that managed and organized the conservative coalition were economic conservatives – primarily concerned with protecting their wealth and privilege – with roots stretching back to the oligarchs of the 19th century.The latter conserved exactly what they set out to do.  Even if that required throwing their erstwhile cultural conservative allies under the bus.Its important to be cognizant of that reality because successful going forward without some “oligarchs” is probably impossible.  But care and vigilance needs to exercised to prevent a recurrence.

            This was something Rush Limbaugh would harp on *way* back in the early nineties in that the left has it easy in that all their groups (at the time) wanted “more government”, it didn’t have to be good, it didn’t have to deliver what they wanted, it just had to be “more”.  OTOH conservatives, generally wanted “less”, but it was made up of a dozen or more groups that wanted it “less” in their own particular way so no force (outside of sometimes the 2nd amendment groups) could be brought to bear to enforce their vision.That’s the “generous” reading, back in the ideological age.  Now that we’re in the demographic age it doesn’t even matter.

                    Because he was one of the great talkers, his solution to every problem was to talk your way out of it. “Facts &amp; logic,” libs OWNED and DESTROYED, “change my mind,” hypocrisy/petard/DR3/etc., are his legacy more than anyone’s.

        I just completed a road trip with a close friend who is still clinging to creedalism, although slowly coming over to our side. Were he not a friend from childhood, his maintained faith in the system might be enough of a reason for me to no longer hang out with him. In addition to his creedalism, he’s a bit of a goofball into conspiracy theories. When I say “conspiracy theories” I don’t mean things that are true that our rulers label “conspiracy theories” in order to hide malfeasance. No, I’m talking about a faked moon landing and chemtrails, stuff like that. Every time I tried to bring up something real, something with a smoking gun involved—like Epstein or Covid—he begged off. I guess conspiracy theories are fun, until they’re true, at which point they become kind of a downer.This quote by Shirley Jackson is relevant: “No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream.” The question then is to provide a dream—something sacral—that isn’t poisonous to our people.I think the seeds of pro white stuff that is positive and forward-looking rather than negative and backward-looking is starting to take effect. You’re seeing more and more respectable whites who have good families and practice solid trades and possess good skills advocating for their right to defend themselves and their posterity, and keeping smiles on their faces while doing it. I don’t even know if Stormfront still exists, and the potbellied, closet homo Colonel Klink types like Matt Heimbach seem to have mostly disappeared. The only time you’ll literally see someone flying the swastika these days is when they’re on some fedgov payroll.

            Conspiracy theories are useful in that they undermine the deference to authority that our system is built upon.  Which is why tptb get so apoplectic about them.
So i’d encourage him in those and gradually introduce real conspiracies to him.
IME people that believe some such theories is nutty ones are more open to others, including real conspiracies.  In that way the crazy ones are a kind of gateway.

            BTW. The moon-landing faked photos conspiracies theories could be true.It’s entirely possible that the US government staged photo ops of the moon landings to build support for the program because the actual pictures were either low quality or damage in some way.If that sounds far fetched, i point out that we’ve all seen NASA videos of probes flying by some planet, asteroid or comet, whatever.  All of those are computer simulations, ie cgi. Those are presented as reality – although when pressed they admit that they’re simulations.  It seams entirely plausible that they did the same at the start of the space program in a clumsy, half assed way.  And there is plenty of examples of government’s lying to prevent exposure of some trivial event, that doesn’t matter all.

                Yeah, belief in the moon landing is very much tied to one’s nation of origin. Something like two-thirds of Russians believe it was faked. Your average American would suggest this was due to their xenophobia toward us and patriotic loyalty to their own space program. Which suggests at least that our own view of things is clouded by patriotic good vibes. I honestly don’t know or even care at this point. It’s so cluttered up with Musk’s cubesats in space that it hardly matters.

                I’m inclined to believe the moon landings and probes are real. It’s just hard for us in 2023 to imagine our government able to do such a thing. It’s like how western Europeans in the year 700 couldn’t fathom that domes and aqueducts were built by fellow Europeans and not aliens or gods.We were a highly capable people just a short time ago. And it’s all withered away, and now we can’t build train routes much less space shuttles.In time, we’re going to wonder how people even drove cars around and maintained them. “It must have been a trick by Satan!” we’ll say.

                    I’ve no problem with the reality of the moon landing, I did, back in the day, question some of the photos and still do.

                The whole driving a dune buggy thing sealed the deal for me. “Hey, I bet we can get these chumps to believe this”Never bet against the stupidity of the average Merrikun.I try not to be stupid, and I like to try and at least keep it above the Mendoza line. In this day and age, it takes a lot more practice for sure.

                But I would think the lack of atmosphere on the moon would make for better photography.

                I am open to the suggestion that they staged photos, but the landings were real. We have photos of the landing sites from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Moonhoaxing and flateartherism are enemy meme warfare, designed to make “conspiracy theorists” look crazy.
@MarkoAmerica could easily replicate the Apollo program, provided you were willing to spend 1% of GDP for the next ten years, like with the original program. But what would be the point?

                    I believe the regime claims they are sending people to Mars? 2030? Social security runs out of money in 2027 so how does that work?

            I spent many years living in rural and wilderness areas and I can assure you that chem-trails were, and are, quite real in specific parts of America.
