        Lerner is typical of the lefties I’ve met.   Having grown up in Missouri/Illinois but living in CT for 35 years  I’m still amazed at the difference.   Given that the meme of the day is transmitted by NPR much like the BBC did for the French resistance in WWII, it is still amazing.   Part of it is the Northeastern insularity both on the left and right.   Views of the South and Midwest are obtained from dispatches by the media  like explorers reports from Darkest Africa.    People are not happy in the Northeast yet they do not relocate easily.   I’ve had headhunters confirm this in droves when I chat with them.   Your average Mass/CT resident has ventured to Cape Cod,  possibly the Maine Coast and once or twice to NYC.  They never drive to the Adirondacks or Catskills in NY and may only have recently ventured to Myrtle Beach or Florida.     This is slowly changing with industry moving out, but those transferees never come back to change the remainders thinking.
