        Johnson; I‚Äôm hetero, perhaps the audience can help?  Is Johnson Top or Bottom?

        I‚Äôm against seizing and freezing someone else‚Äôs money, be that someone a person or a nation it just ain‚Äôt right.Putin and Russia, in my opinion made every effort to be part of the west, we locked up their, safely in a bank cash and, no other words for it, drove then in to a strong alliance with China. Sadly, in the long run I think that‚Äôs a far better position for Russia to be in rather than just another client state in the, let them all eat bugs, great New World order.Actually in the very long run, it might be good for us too if Russia prospers as part of the orient,, forcing us to see what we‚Äôve become.

            If I recall correctly, G. Washington refused to freeze assets of the enemy held in the US during the revolutionary war precisely for that reason ‚Äì as a fledgling nation, he did not want to destroy the credibility/trust of the US with the rest of the world.Granted, we are still strong enough (for now) to bully others, but those days are quickly disappearing.  How much of our ‚Äústrength‚Äù is a paper tiger is another issue.  But as for credibility/trust, that is long gone, not sure if it can be regained.  I guess the US is still ‚Äútrusted‚Äù because there is not another option.

        Anyone find it amusing that the US has to make the entire payroll and pension obligations of Ukraine, while mayor of NYC has announced cuts to police and schools to pay for the illegal aliens infesting his city.  And when he complains too loudly the Geheimestaatspolizie show up for a ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù investigation?  Don‚Äôt get me wrong NYC invited them so it a FAFO exercise‚Äîbut I guess Adams can‚Äôt recycle enough of the aid money he‚Äôs been asking for into the right pockets.

            SamlAdams:  Your point about funding aliens before putative Americans is valid.  If NY were still ‚Äì by any possible metric ‚Äì an American city, I might possibly give a small f**k.  But it is inhabited by nothing but dindus, south and east Asians, mestizos from throughout South America, Haitians, Dominicans, various varieties of middle-men money lenders (Jewish, Armenian, Greek, etc.) and a smattering of Ellis Island ethnics who cling to the ruins.
Wall it all off and wait it out.  Salt the earth, and wait another decade or so before razing the ruins and possibly rebuilding.

                The term of art is ethnic white, not  Ellis island ethnic. The borough of Staten Island is an ethnic white stronghold, and hardly a ruin. The best pizza in New York for starters.

            Sam is right in that decisions like these could not make the priorities of our elites any clearer.Add to that the fact that San Francisco was able to clean its streets of homeless settlements in preparation for the visit by the Chinese leader.This has prompted white progressive retards to ask, ‚ÄúIf you can clean up the streets for this event, why won‚Äôt you clean them up for us?Because they hate whites, even progressives.  It could not be clearer, yet there are none so blind as those who refuse to see.(My liberal friends who had to flee Portland due to the results of the policies that they supported later confessed to me that they never really believed that the leaders of Portland would allow the city to fall.  They believed that they could virtue signal without consequence and the leaders of Portland called their bluff.)

                I‚Äôve heard it said that ‚Äúthe president should always be at least a little bit more conservative than you yourself are,‚Äù and along those lines, it‚Äôs possible some leftists kind of unconsciously took it for granted that their political leaders always would be, since it had been thus for so long.

                A lot of the problem with the Left Coast in general is that the ‚Äúleadership‚Äù never understood that the magic variable in the California success formula was not x, y, or z but w ‚Äì for weather. Cali has been able, for decades, to pursue policies that, were the climate more like the rest of the country, would have caused it to lose population like Ukraine has been instead of just the slow bleed they‚Äôve seen. Normies, even normie Whites, still move there from all over the country just for sunshine and warm weather. So the state succeeded in the past mainly in spite of the local elite. They‚Äôve got no idea how to ‚Äúclean up the streets‚Äù in a consistent way because they can‚Äôt connect their constant social experiments to the way the place looks today.The situation in Oregon and Washington is even more hopeless because the elites here are all just California washouts who couldn‚Äôt make it there. They think they can implement California policies and get away with it because of some kind of West Coast Magic Dirt. The Magic was the California sunshine and warm weather though and doesn‚Äôt work here in Coldrainistan.When you add in the wannabe hipster flotsam that washes up here from the Midwest and Northeast you‚Äôre dealing with a whole other level of clueless and ignorant. Most of them still don‚Äôt understand why legalizing all drugs didn‚Äôt result in a pothead paradise but instead turned the place into a never-ending episode of Breaking Bad.

        Money laundering?  Certainly.
BUT. FOR. WHAT?
We‚Äôre not talking about a few million for the big guy, or to raise Raytheon stock .25cents a share.
US gov raised black budgets with the ‚Äúarms for hostages‚Äù and generic weapons sales to fund a war in Nicaragua in the 1980‚Äôs.
I understand the Ukraine war to drain Russia (not working), make Germany our bitch (working and then some), maybe to control global energy markets.
But where is the money going?  What national level goal is all this slush going?

            I think the upper level grifters‚Äìthink Blackrock, Raytheon‚Äìare converting the bribes and graft into hard assets. The Ho‚Äôs and Help in Congress are getting just enough to do a small-scale version. It is a hedge against devalued fiat currency, which continues to lose worth.

        In his discussion of the money side of the conflict, I was surprised that Z Man did not mention that the Israel-Hamas conflict will require a flood of money from the USA as well, which will likely compete with the flow of money to Ukraine.  Granted, our elites are willing to print unlimited money for both of these conflicts, but I would guess that Israel‚Äôs claim on that money will take precedence.

        Off topic‚ÄîSince I assume everyone here is an unapologetic libertarian. üòé The first -real- libertarian to be elected in a very very long time has had his day in Argentina. This is not the milquetoast US libertarian that Z makes fun of on the regular. This appears to be an actual fire-breathing ‚Äúfuck all your rules‚Äù libertarian which is why they are collectively pissing themselves both here &amp; abroad.Javier Milei won their election in Argentina, Mr. 70s Porno Hair, and the leftists are already calling him ‚Äúfar right‚Äù even though he is anything but. This is why I cannot even speak with left leaning people anymore. They have all become hysterical cat ladies, both male &amp; female. My friends who have been just consuming 24x7x365 propaganda are utterly feminized &amp; brainwashed at this point.These were ‚Äònormal‚Äô guys at one time. They all sound like HR Managers &amp; Karens now shrieking about how ‚Äòunsafe‚Äô anyone that doesn‚Äôt vote in utter lockstep with the far left machine is now. It‚Äôs demoralizing and also shows me how effective propaganda is.Anyhow, back on topic, of course all media outlets which lean far left are saying he‚Äôs the next Trump, Bolsinaro (Brazil), Hitler, whatever, because did I mention hysterical feminized screeching? In reality he simply wants government out of -everything-. Novel concept!Let‚Äôs see what he can do, it is hard when all the other politicians have their knives out for you. That was Trump‚Äôs mistake, trusting the system. It must be completely turned upside down before you even begin to try and pass any legislation or change anything. Argentina‚Äôs government is still lefty socialist to unsure how much better he will fare then Trump.

                    Oh I don‚Äôt doubt your take. My point was not that he was some ‚Äúultra based‚Äù radical. It was exactly the -opposite- of that. He is something different, and -anything- different is ‚Äúfar right‚Äù in the hivemind of globalist bugmen no matter what country they hail from.
He is eccentric though which often means unpredictable. So anything that may upset the status quo (like Trump) is generally better than maintaining it. But, yes, I don‚Äôt think Argentinians are going to be throwing Roman Salutes anytime soon.

                Hoping for Argentina he‚Äôs NOT the ‚Äúreal deal‚Äù. Libertarianism is a great system for white teenage boys with IQs &gt;120, as I once was. I paid LP dues for 15 years. I voted for Ed Clark ‚Äì I know what it‚Äôs all about.
It‚Äôs also a great system for criminals.
I suspect Argentina has few of the former and plenty of the latter.
We live, as they say, in a society.

            Apex:  I‚Äôve read various takes on Milei.  If I were an Argentinian nationalist, my main concern ‚Äì along with inflation ‚Äì would be the massive immigration due to open borders there.   Where once Argentina had a solid plurality of European people (Italians, Spanish, Germans), it is now filled with Bolivian indios, various other mestizos, and increasing numbers of Africans.  Not to mention, it has had small hats running its press since the 1940s.Not making any predictions and will wait and see, of course, but I trust no politician, either elected or appointed.  Bolsonaro seemed legit, given he was 100% European stock, but he was trying to run multiracial Brazil, and he slunk off to AINO in the end.  No big hopes for any substantial changes, anywhere yet.

                Bolsonaro was 100% subverted by the political and media system, like Trump, and quite possibly electoral fraud as well (like Trump). Brazilians with money are looking to get out, as Lula is raising taxes sharply on them in order to buy more votes among his constituency.

                    Jannie:  Yes, from what I read/saw it seemed like the same sort of bureaucratic forces and global money men who opposed Trump here forced out Bolsonaro.  They didn‚Äôt succeed in having him stabbed to death, but they got rid of him just the same.  And in Brazil (just as in AINO/Brazil del Norte) there are too many mixed race/poor who want a handout.  It‚Äôs really a shame, because Brazil has the natural resources to be a much wealthier country, but it lacks the human capital.

                I‚Äôve been living in Argentina for the past 20 years, am bilingual and have an Argentine dtr-in-law and three Argentine grandchildren. I was active in the Milei campaign and will be actively involved in forming a coalition of small parties on the local, ‚Äúcounty‚Äù and provincial levels. I feel confident that I can comment from a point of view that‚Äôs reasonably knowledgeable,One aspect of the election that is little commented upon outside the country has to do with the incoming vice-president, Victoria Villaruel, a Traditional Catholic (SSPX) from a military family that is as ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù  as they come here. Most of my campaign pals are retired military hard-liners. The would-be troublemakers are well aware that if they get funky, they could be biting off more than they can chew. I keep hope alive knowing that.A comment reply isn‚Äôt nearly space enough to write all that I‚Äôd wish to write about this sweeping change in the political landscape. Milei carried 21 of Argentina‚Äôs 24 provinces and barely lost Buenos Aires. We shall soon see what can be accomplished in the first hundred days, but Mr. Milei plans to begin with some very sweeping and necessary changes. He‚Äôs not your grampa‚Äôs libertarian either. I see his administration as the means to build something for my son and grandchildren. Hat tip to Mr. Milei for managing to get me out of my club chair and quiet retirement. Things are jumpin‚Äô down here!

                    Fascinating stuff. I have a question: did Milei take an immigration position that cracks down on those flooding in from Paraguay, Boliva, Venezuela, etc., or was it standard libertarian pablum?

                Libs vaguely hear about our nefarious ‚Äúideology‚Äù from their media/leaders but they never encounter us anywhere, so they attribute exaggerated versions of our positions to normal conservatives‚Äîwho with few exceptions are just a lower class of liberal Christians.
Conservatives hear about our nefarious ‚Äúideology‚Äù from those accusatory libs, never encounter us anywhere, and endlessly, fruitlessly defend themselves against being identified with us, alienating almost everybody in the process.
All very productive.

        Has anyone seen the new documentary ‚Äúthe fall of Minneapolis‚Äù?
There is a lot of stuff that seemed suspicious as hell about the Floyd thing. Like how did the case supernova from an untimely death to a full blown riot within three days?
I feel there has to be some collusion between various parties. Someone should try to foia all the relevant parties to see what was being discussed. Is it possible the media had the entire bodycam video and intentionally withheld exculpatory information?

            ‚ÄúLike how did the case supernova from an untimely death to a full blown riot within three days?‚ÄùYou can blame the press for that. They immediately painted a very unrealistic picture for the public. People watched a video with people pleading to the cops ‚Äúyou‚Äôre killing him‚Äù and then he actually died. They also insisted, despite video evidence to the contrary, that cops were on his neck.  It make the whole thing look premeditated and callus.Of course, the reality is that had Floyd not been high on Fentanyl/dope (which suppresses breathing) and sick with covid along with having heart disease, he wouldn‚Äôt have died. The video started in the middle of the incident, which also made it look premeditated and callus.  The national press then spread the story far and wide causing riots across the country.

                well that‚Äôs the thing. We all know what a deepfake is. But that belies the fact that we already have a defacto deepfake ‚Äì i.e. lying by omission.
This is a difficult thing because I‚Äôve always admired people like Kunstler and Darrow in there defense of the first amendment. What I‚Äôm worried about is that the media could cause a ‚Äúwar of the worlds‚Äù type incident (look it up, it happened in 1938) and cause something truly catastrophic to happen.

Precisely. Like finding any reason to put off/stall/cancel the 2024 election under some bogus pretense. They can‚Äôt hand over power to Trump; they know if they do their goose is cooked. Think they‚Äôre going to pull out all the stops on this &amp; the ‚Äúmedia‚Äù will be 110% in the tank for it.
Hope I‚Äôm wrong but I wouldn‚Äôt put anything ‚Äúoff limits‚Äù to this fascist cabal.

                    the floyd incedent was a preplanned incedent just like that.  Those riots were orgainzed and preplanned . there were videos all over youtube, rumble and odysee of prepossitioned pallets of bricks, and police always ordered to stand down.  there were also a number of videos of Locals peacefully protesting , then a couple of young , athletic looking white guys in full black garb would show up. carrying umbrellas to and wearing blalclavas they would start hammering windows to get the real destriction started. The signs they carried were professionally printed im many cases and brought in in rented trucks . in some cases the ‚Äúrioters ‚Äù came in by unmarked bus.Speaking of uniparty, the GOP governors had their cops stand down .   nothing at all spontaneous about it .

                        The prevalence of smartphones, bodycams, etc‚Ä¶ and the high rates of criminality among our minorities means that there‚Äôs guaranteed to be a continuous flood of ‚Äúriot-worthy‚Äù video circulating. Baltimore or Chicago alone probably generate a Floyd event or two every weekend in the warmer months.What this means to me is that there must be a system to process this garbage and harvest the ‚Äúbest‚Äù of it. From there it moves to a staging area of some sort and someone decides whether to green light it or hold off. The deciding factor is how great the need of the system for a violent distraction of some sort.It‚Äôs a card they always have and can play when they need it. A lot of the impact of this stuff though is less now than it used to be due to the fact that the worst hit areas are still hollowed out and businesses and people are not likely to be lured back in.

                    No mass movement in the US is created by the media; it is promoted and mobilized by the media. If there is a deepfake event (and I doubt many actual believed the broadcast ‚Äì most likely a few loons), it will be at the behest of the overlords, like Floyd. The deepfake is the tool to mobilize the masses, not the actual origin.

        Asked and answered:‚ÄúThe big question that looms over all of it is what comes next for Ukraine?‚Äù‚Äú‚Ä¶You blame that guy for the failures and buy another round of funding the operation.‚ÄùZelensky and his jews disappear one night. They may re-surface a time or two but eventually he will be spoted by kooks in the company of Elvis and Adoph Hitler.The Russians will take Odessa without firing a shot. They will rebuild their investments in the Donbas and purge any remaining Uke loyalists. What‚Äôs left of the Kraine will be one of the very few white 3rd world nations. It will be a haven for welfare cases and criminals and will be yet another millstone around the neck of Globohomo. Grifters will launch fake charities to save the people of the ‚ÄòKraine.Over here, our leaders will look stupidly at each other trying to figure out what went wrong. It will turn out to be the fault of the US military which is still dangerously low on diversity. The Whitehouse will evade and deflect any talk of the Kraine, and we will have another Current Thing land on our plate that will be an existential threat to us all and require our undivided attention.That new current thing could be a financial meltdown or crisis that burns Globohomo to the ground for the short term. Classical white racism and antisemitism will become mainstream hobbies.as the multiculti dream also dies a well deserved death. Mass deportations will become a regular occurance.Long term‚Ä¶ our future is bright. Short term‚Ä¶ I will try to sleep through most of it and survive it if I can.

        Slowly at first, then all of a sudden.I think someone will try to assassinate Zelensky.  He will either be killed or flee the country.  The Russians will be blamed, but it‚Äôll be an inside job by the military or the secret police.Burns could have been in Kiev preparing them for what will basically amount to a terrorism war against Russia.  The war will be lost, but the violence and funding will continue.Once we get into 2024, all bets are off for US funding.  Ukraine is radioactive to Republican base voters.  If funding gets passed, it‚Äôll pass with mostly Democrat votes, like the CR last week.  That creates problems for Democrats, faced with an unpopular war that is being lost hung around their necks.  They can push Biden over a cliff, but taking risky votes for POTATUS in an election year?  TBH, the Democrats best hope is for the GOP to save them by killing the funding.  Then they can blame the GOP for Ukraine losing when it was on the cusp of total victory.  Or so the news will report it.DC probably settles on a half hearted aid package and retreats.  Then they shift to a terrorism/insurgent campaign.  We‚Äôve seen this before.

                Not really.  We agree on the Official Government Party aspects of this.  They do still like to keep up appearances, though.I also think public sentiment so completely rejects the Ukraine War that the Government Party has to worry about a full collapse in its perceived legitimacy.  Right now, about 70-80% of the country basically wants us out of Ukraine, but only 30-40% believes the current regime is illegitimate.  If they push too hard, they risk raising the proportion of people who think the current government is illegitimate.  They will seek a solution that maintains the patina of legitimacy, which means counting on Republicans to either kill it or Republicans being given enough money to get Ukraine funding just over some minimum threshold.When it comes to voting machines, the Government Party depends on the bulk of that fraud in key locations where they enjoy loyalty from local election officials.The safe bet is they pass just enough money to say they ‚Äúdid something‚Äù while preaching that they want ‚Äúaccountability‚Äù.  The usual games.You‚Äôre not their audience.

        To me the biggest surprise is that there hasn‚Äôt yet been a coup in Ukraine, nor any minor uprisings, nor any lone gunmen targeting Zelensky‚Ä¶ Or maybe it‚Äôs not that surprising? People will just take anything. No amount of abuse, beatings and mass killing will wake them up?Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men have died in this war. For what? Do they believe in something or are they just meekly following orders? If they do believe in something, what is it? Drag Queen story hours for Ukrainian children? Or is the distant possibility of joining the EU worth dying for?

Zelensky missed his opportunity to flee to a nice resort in Florida with his embezzled cash. The puppet thought he had agency.

            We have absolutely no clue whether this is true or not. The propaganda organs certainly wouldn‚Äôt let us know, and Russian/pro-Russian commentariat likely doesn‚Äôt have that type of access. My guess is American assets have Zelensky cordoned off to an unimaginable degree. Those will be the ones who deliver the dirt nap.

                You are partly right, but Zelensky is not alone. I haven‚Äôt heard about anybody from his inner circle being seriously targeted. Lone gunmen stories can be successfully covered up, to a degree, but if there were any uprisings, the Russians would have used them for propaganda. Since they did not, there probably were none. Same with coup attempts.

                    His inner circle most likely has similar protection, and localized uprisings could go without detection. There is a great deal of hatred of the Russians for very good reasons outside of the east, so these may not have happened, but we likely would not know about it.

            It‚Äôs joining the West, as they see it. Russia is the devil they know, and they want nothing to do with it.
It‚Äôs hard for Westerners to understand how deep of a hold the mirage of the West has on Europoors. Even with all the eerie insanity starting to sip in, most people in the East still equate globo-homo with unbridled goodness.

                    Well, GloboHeauxmeaux without diversity would actually be a modest improvement, at least in the short term, for most people. Alas, in the long term, diversification into oblivion is the inevitable outcome, and with that comes misery galore. Unfortunately, most whites these days do not think in the long term.

This is disconcerting especially since they shouldn‚Äôt be all that ignorant of the disastrous consequences this has had in the West.
I find myself surprised at how absolutely incongruent to reality these people are; even from the position of someone who watched the Overton window in the US shifting left in real time over the past two decades.

            I imagine domestically this war has been portrayed as the Ukraine‚Äôs Great Patriotic War, against the Russians, who genuinely are hated there. This false narrative has been sufficient, to this point, to keep the wheels of the abattoir greased with Ukrainian blood. The Ukes think they are fighting and dying for their country, when in reality they are sacrifical babes to the Judeo-American Molloch.

            My understanding is that they were like an America First movement that peaked in the 1950s.  They charged that communists were taking over our government.  I believe that they accused Ike of being a commie.  I am told that this made most Americans who were sympathetic to them dismiss them as crazy.Around this time, two seminal white activists who had supported the Birch Society, Revillo P. Oliver and George Lincoln Rockwell, broke with the Society because they believed that attacking ‚Äúcommunists‚Äù was misleading.  They had a more specific description of the problem in mind, which was unacceptable.Oliver had a high leadership position in the Society and was an impressively erudite man.  If you‚Äôre curious, look up his writings on the subject.

            They will literally forget they were ever pro-Ukraine within a year. How many scumbags from a couple of years ago remember cutting off their family because they were not vaccinated? How many came around like nothing happened? Same people. Empty vessels to be filled with The Current Thing.

        I agree that the money keeps flowing to Ukraine because it is a laundering operation by both parties in DC.
I also think the Dems keep the funding going hoping to stave off collapse until after 2024 and the GOP keep the funding going because they don‚Äôt want to be blamed for the collapse by Dems and media when it happens.

        Assuming the world is not reduced to smoldering rubble, future historians probably will point to the Ukraine fuckery as the closing chapter of two decades of non-stop Global American Empire violence. Public opinion plays absolutely no role in what the GAE does, but war requires some buy-in for it to be successful. That is gone and it never coming back. Also, the reality of deindustrialization has revealed the hard limits of American power‚Äìit is a financer of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù but in no way an arsenal now. The United States‚Äô economy on paper remains the world‚Äôs strongest but given current conditions that makes it the tallest midget in the room; WEF governance doesn‚Äôt work out for the hosts even if the loaded parasites thrive. Finally, the allies/satrapies have started to buckle. Erdogan seems perfectly willing to invade Our Greatest Ally, and absolutely no one thinks Article V would be invoked if Israel bombs Turkey in response. The sham of NATO has been laid bare.While you have followed developments much more closely than I, this in fact does appear to be a classic stalemate. Whether that was deliberate strategy on the part of Russia seems up in the air. I‚Äôve read that people in western Ukraine continue to go about their daily lives somewhat as before although the number of them doing so dwindles daily.‚ÄúThis is most likely at the behest of the State Department, which has been running things on the side‚Ä¶‚ÄùSomeone at Severian‚Äôs site noted recently that State has become dominated by Karens, the daughters of wealthy apparatchiks who need a job. We saw some of this while Trump was in office with State Karens routinely disregarding and dissing the boss. Throw in Cult Kagan, and ‚Äúswamp‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe the dysfunctional grift machine there. As we all know, the Strong Women will be hyper vicious and then devolve into raw hysterics as things get even grimmer. It should be a cause for concern.The Ukraine War was cynically provoked and prolonged by the Empire to weaken Europe, drain Russia, and showcase American might. The first happened, but the latter two goals failed spectacularly. Hundreds of thousands have died needlessly in this evil exercise, and no one will be held to account. The wicked prosper, but for how much longer?

            I think ir was incredibly stupid for GAE to make this war an all or nothing game. If they had just let Russia do it‚Äôs thing, or before that, said the door to NATO is shut, they wouldn‚Äôt have lost a lot of prestige. Now they‚Äôve all but bet the farm on it. Really stupid.

                It is the money, and loss of prestige only matters if those who profit suffer consequences to themselves. They do not and will not. Note the meetings last week with the Chinese and who sat at the big boys‚Äô table. Some of those have dibs on rebuilding the Ukraine, although that might not be feasible.

                    Yeah, that is something I meant to but neglected to mention. The sanctions failing to have much effect shocked the hell out of them. It is a sidenote at the moment but that is another big takeaway long term from this horror‚Äìthe GAE‚Äôs economic dominance has diminished.

                I‚Äôd go even further back and argue that it was incredibly stupid for the GAE to turn Russian into an enemy.  Russia‚Äôs always been this uneasy combination of European liberalism and Oriental despotism.  After the Cold War ended there should have been every effort made to encourage Russia to become part of a larger Europe, but instead we were over-staffed with a bunch of NATO and State Dept. bureaucrats who saw their job as continuing to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù Russia and they pushed and poked and prodded   to the point that we‚Äôre now close to getting in a shooting war with people who should now be at least as much our ‚Äúally‚Äù as France is.It‚Äôs comparable in a weird way with what‚Äôs been going on with North Korea.  The place is a completely destitute s**thole where people have to eat bugs and tree bark and their neighbor‚Äôs children just to stay alive.  If we just ignored them, the government would implode on its own accord.  Instead we actively prop the government up by giving them money just to get them to return the calls of a bunch of a**holes at State who are charged with ‚Äúengaging‚Äù with them.

                    The Tribal termites were eating away even before the USSR collapsed. After the implosion, the unhinged lunacy of bombing Serbia, a Russian protectorate, into oblivion more or less guaranteed a permanent rift. W initially tried to make amends, believe it or not, but given those who surrounded him‚Äìmany termites and their enablers‚Äìhe instead ratcheted it up. Same happened with Obama. Trump was despised because he wouldn‚Äôt go along with the Tribe‚Äôs Russia animus, so the dementia patient was installed.The world would have been a far better place if the United States had rebuilt Russia and welcomed it into the world. Instead, it opted to exploit it and make war on it. Putin is very popular as a direct and understandable result.

                        And an easy sell with the Tribe, who view the US as their big dumb golem to get back at their perceived tormentor of centuries‚Äô standing. Why, yes, they did take out the Khazarian slave trading entity that was impressing their people and selling them on as slaves to Russia‚Äôs dangerous foe, the Ottomans, and understandandably they kept a close eye on the Tribe residing in their empire thenceforeward.Then, the Tribe helped to assemble a grouping of malcontents to stage the Russian Revolution (with lots of help from you know who living in the West). They worked savagery upon the Orthodox of Russia, but finally Stalin began to smell a rat and outmaneuvered them, and for that sin, when the USSR thought that the leftist Jews of Israel would be friendly, well, not to be. Revenge takes precedence, don‚Äôt ya know.Then the 90s, when they thought they had the Russians where they wanted them at last, only to have Russian patriots put paid to their plans.So, yet again their fellow Tribesmen were laying for Russia in Ukraine. Getting the band back together in Ol‚Äô Khazaria.Oops.

My question is why are the Russians always the bad guys? Look if it‚Äôs 1980 &amp; they have 40 armored divisions poised to plunge thru the Fulda Gap in a blitzkrieg attack across Western Europe I get it, but that hasn‚Äôt been the case since 1991. And there are zero indications that Putin‚Äôs Russia wants to expand westward but you wouldn‚Äôt know that Constant demonization ramped up in large part with the totally bogus ‚ÄúRussian Collusion‚Äù hoax against Trump.
Seems we really have more in common with Russians than not.

Ukraine was the internationalist Jews‚Äô playground. They OWNED it. They see Ukrainians as THEIR herd of white human cattle and they will be damned if they will see their property taken from them, much less liberated.
We are approaching the Gotterdammerung moment where the losers are divided between those who want to cut a deal with the winner to salvage what they can and those who would prefer to see everything and everyone burn.

        I‚Äôd assume that the money laundering machine is looking toward rebuilding Ukraine as the next source of money.The problem, of course, is that the Russians likely won‚Äôt play ball. The neocons seem to think that this game ends when they say so. Just tell the Russians that everyone stops fighting and leave the map as is. But the Russians have other plans. They aren‚Äôt going to quit until they get the territory that they feel they need.Hard to say exactly when the Russians want but it‚Äôs more than just the Donbas now. They probably want Odessa, maybe all of eastern Ukraine. They‚Äôll also want a friendly govt for what‚Äôs left of Ukraine and guarantees that it won‚Äôt join NATO.The neocons wouldn‚Äôt accept those terms, so the war will continue until the Ukrainian military collapses. It‚Äôs a shame, but it‚Äôs hard to see how else this ends.

                The sum total of Wall Street investments in Ukraine is trivial compared to those held in US apartment buildings. This is not a financial project, but an imperial project. In any case, the only thing of value in non-Donbass Ukraine is hot chicks (many of whom have left) and great farmland. The farmland will be valuable regardless of the outcome.

            This is the fallback position: a tribal kleptocracy (the Khazar Bazaar) at the western terminus of China‚Äôs Belt and Road, just waiting for the next opportunity to have another go at mother Russia.

            In the saber-rattling which preceded the Russian invasion, and the negotiations with Ukraine that followed, Russia wanted the implementation of the Minsk Agreements (regional autonomy for the Donbass within Ukraine) and a guarantee of no NATO membership. When Ukraine withdrew that offer in exchange for Western promises of support, Russia formally annexed the oblasts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kerson (enabling the use their conscripted soldiers in the fighting).Now that the Ukrainian army looks destined to collapse, Russia may seek to incorporate four additional Russian-majority oblasts adjacent to those they have already annexed. Failure to do so would doom their inhabitants to the sort of violence residents of the Donbas Republics have suffered over the past nine years. Russia would probably prefer to leave the remainder of the landlocked Ukraine independent.Unfortunately, with the West likely unwilling to permit Ukrainian neutrality, and determined to rearm Ukraine no matter what, Russia may be forced to set up a satellite state such as those that existed during the Cold War in the Soviet. Isn‚Äôt it ironic that every stage of Ukraine‚Äôs loss of sovereignty (even Crimea, annexed following the Maiden Coup) comes at the behest of the United States and her NATO allies?

Yes, and Putin strikes me as cagey and even cynical about pursuing Russia‚Äôs interest. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the idealistic Christian Nationalist crusader some hope he is. Plus, isn‚Äôt Blackrock or somebody buying up the land? What will the displaced Ukrainians do‚Äî buy it back?

        I hope the war ends soon with minimum bloodshed. From a military history POV I think it‚Äôs a very interesting war. It seems to be the second war, after the first Armenia Azerbaijan war in 2020, where small drones have played a major role. It seems that artillery and drones compliment each other synergetically, tanks and APCs are becoming obsolescent.It also seems like infantry is becoming a match for armor and helicopter gunships on a more level field, because of RPGs. Something simiyseems to be happening with manned aircraft. Big expensive manned platforms are struggling. In soldiering the geek seems to be getting the upper hand over the jock. On some level that‚Äôs gotta be dysgenic (??)Economy of force and of gear is clearly also vital, with slowmo collapsing economies. A sniper bullet is $10, an artillery round maybe $200. A cheap military grade drone some thousands. But a single use hellfire missile is something like $150,000. That‚Äôs just insane. A cruise missile a couple of millions. Soon they‚Äôre not only going to need political commissars but in-field accountant commissars.Both from a state military and fron a guerilla POV, there are so many lessons from this war that haven‚Äôt been digested yet.I think swarms of cheap unmanned stuff is the future

                Agree. Physics seems to generally favor projectiles, to include grenades of various types, over armor. It‚Äôs especially acute in body armor. I recently saw Kentucky Ballistics (love that channel btw) blow right through level IV ceramics with a solid round.416 safari rifle

                    The other factor has been mines. This is to a great degree a mine war. Neither side has figured out how to solve the mine problem in order to bring their armor directly at enemy positions. Modern mines can be quickly laid from a distance. The defenders mine the areas in front and when the enemy tries to clear the mine fields, they just keep remining the area.The use of smart mines is another problem. Both sides use mines that lie dormant until people and equipment pass through to the middle of the field then they activate, trapping men and equipment in a mine field. This is what happened when Ukraine try to use NATO tactics in the south using all those brand new Western tanks and armored vehicles

                        That‚Äôs a hor cartridge. What kind of energies does it get?
About body armor, yes it does work ‚Äì and I recommend people to get it . But a .416 defeats at least some level IV. And a .416 is not that big a behemoth to drag around. Yes it cycles slow (bolt action) and it kicks like a mule. So if rounds like that caught on they‚Äôd need a level V if that even exists. And who knows if material science can even produce something that stops such rounds AND deflect the giant energy dump

                        A reply to Moran.  The 6.8mm cartidge fires a 135 grain bullet at 3000 fps out of a 16 inch barrel, at least in its civilian loading.  The military load is likely to be hotter since the new Army service rifle has a 13 inch barrel and is relatively heavy.  The optics are quite sophisticated, so the Army expects more hits per rounds fired and the new rifle isn‚Äôt designed for particularly long-range shooting.  The objective is to punch through enemy body armor at normal combat ranges.

            IIRC, the last Quadrennial Defense Review of 2014 (before they changed the name to the National Defense Strategy) discussed the significant implications of drone swarms and UAV etc at great length. So this issue, so prominent in Ukraine, has been visible to military planners for well over 10 years. But our doctrine hasn‚Äôt changed much. Why?
Perhaps because drones and UAVs are pretty cheap compared with old aviation and missile/artillery hardware and the business model of defense contractors doesn‚Äôt work as well with all the new stuff.

                Yes, money matters. Also all the decision makers in the Pentagon were trained as young lieutenants on big manned platforms. 120 ago there were plenty of cavalry colonels who refused to give up their ponies because of a nasty thing called machine guns. Old dogs really are hard to retrain

        The Ukraine war has boomeranged horribly on the West‚Ä¶Russia is booming economically, the Russian Army is larger, stronger, and up to date with drones, missiles and artillery that are the best in the World, and most of the casualties have been amongst the DPR troops‚Ä¶While NATO has disarmed itself in a futile attempt to prop up Ukraine‚Äôs military, and the EU has badly damaged its economy‚Ä¶.Game, set and match to Vlad Putin‚Ä¶

            I was surprised to see USA Today, the mainstreamers mainstream, rate the Russian military the strongest in the world a few weeks ago.Russia‚Äôs economy consists of men making real things, the US‚Äôs economy consists of tatted up dykes with a face full of fishing tackle selling blue check marks on twitter.If Joe Blow is a day late paying his credit card bill, the $35 late payment charge counts as an increase in GDP according to the Fed.

            The Russians are playing things very close to the vest. Putin recently gave a big speech and there was nothing in it that gave a clue as to what they are thinking comes next. According to our media. Moscow cut off all comms with Washington outside the nuclear hotline and some high level military comms last year. The Kremlin just ignores the Europeans entirely.That suggests they do not feel any need to open a dialogue with the West. They will get what they want without it. Alternatively, it is part of a strategy to bleed the West until they are ready to make an offer. That probably only happens after the election.

                There is a Russian word –Ω–µ–¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ—Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–Ω—ã, which translates as ‚Äúnot agreement capable.‚Äù In light of the fact that former French president Fran√ßois Holland and former German chancellor Angela Merkel have said that they entered into the 2015 Minsk Accords with no intention of honoring them, and the fact that the United States has withdrawn from treaties such as the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, the Anti-ballistic Missile defense treaty and the Joint Protocols with Iran, Russia quite reasonably considers that neither western European or American leaders are agreement capable.  Russia will likely present the West with a ‚Äútake it or leave it‚Äù solution and continue the war until the proposal becomes an offer that the West cannot refuse.

                    This is one of those things that gets no mention in the West, but is becoming a problem. The rest of the world no longer trust Washington. The Chinese have made this clear repeatedly. Biden and his people say something to their face and then turn around and say or do the opposite. This just happened in San Francisco. Biden‚Äôs people assured the Chinese that there would be no more dictator talk and as soon as Xi was on the plane home Biden is calling him a dictator.It is not Biden specific, although he is a promiscuous liar. Non country can trust that a deal with Washington will stick, even if the president at the time seems earnest. The perfidy of the permanent foreign policy establishment, the neocons, overwhelms any honest efforts by the elected class.

        A good assessment Mr. Z. Perhaps the best thing that can happen soon is a swift resolution of the war. Zelenski‚Äôs days are numbered, once he‚Äôs gone a new regime can blame him for the failure and make a deal with the Russians.  The money laundering operations will have to go somewhere else.
I hope that you‚Äôre feeling better now.

The best thing for Ukraine would be a collapse of the army this winter. This would lead to a collapse of the political leadership and and end to the war. it would be chaos for a year, but at least the war would be over.
