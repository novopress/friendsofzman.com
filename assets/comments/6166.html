        I’d like to know just how many Americans (particularly young ones) believe it’s logically true that a man who thinks he’s a woman is a woman. I’d love to believe most (even young) Americans know it’s bs and that this helps fuel the backlash to ‘progressive’ politics but I’m not at all sure this is the case. Extremist movements might tend to be irrational and political-correctness is increasingly an anti-rational movement (can’t let the truth get in the way). Once you can get people to believe the impossible, getting them to believe the implausible is nothing.I’d like to know what percentage believe a ‘person’ isn’t a woman simply by thinking so and what percentage know it isn’t true but believe it’s right and proper to pretend it is true in order to coddle them. In Europe, the dogmas of political correctness are being shattered by violent Muslim immigrants so Europe will move to the right. In America, there aren’t as yet as many Muslim immigrants and America might continue it’s steady march into the depths of political-correctness.Daniel Pipes noted after the Paris attacks that following Islamic terrorist attacks, the public moves to the right and governments shift further to the left. This seems to hold true even now. If Trump gets elected this might just change.

        I don’t buy Mencius Moldbug’s Calvinist “Cathedral” theory that presumably you are alluding to, ZMan. Elements of it make some sense, but it completely ignores the Jewish influence on the Progressive movement, which has been growing steadily since the early 20th century, and is arguably now driving it completely.

            Frankly, I think Moldbug is mostly a windbag. I’ve read little of his work because I don’t have time to read 10,000 word blog posts. So, any similarities you see are at best coincidental.
As far as the Jews, my read is they just gave up their old religion for the new one. They brought brainpower and a Talmudical zeal to go with the Progressive Jesuitical zeal.

        Nice post – you really get to the heart of it.I’m starting to think it’s gone further than this — the managerial elitehasan answer, and they’re not shy about articulating it.  It’s “because we’re Better Than You.”  Wasn’t it Bill Clinton who said that the problem with letting people invest their own retirement money is that they tend to invest stupidly?  Bill Clinton, who never held a real job in his life?The old elite held this attitude, of course, but couldn’t say so.  Consider William F. Buckley Jr.  No doubt he thought he was far above us, but he’d done his time in the army, so he couldn’t lord it over the hoi polloitoomuch — Fred from the motor pool might have stories, and besides, he’d at leastseenhis fellow Americans at close quarters.The next generation of elites had never laid eyes on a real American, but as their fathers had, they at least possessed some residual humility.  That’s why they placed such emphasis on college degrees — I’mobjectivelybetter than you, since I have a BA in “political science.”  Not only does it say “science” right there in the title, but it’s from college, in an era where a high school degree is still something of an achievement.The third generation has not only internalized this attitude, but has no qualms about saying so.  They’re justbetter,full stop.  Which makes it awfully hard to periodically submit to the judgment of the hoi polli, even if it’s 99% fake and only happens every four years.  (As you’re a student of Roman history, I’m sure you appreciate that this is the same problem they had in the latter days of the Principate — why go through the dog-and-pony show; why not just rule like Oriental despots, since that’s clearly what we are?)If I were some scheming Machiavellian adviser to the global elite (and guys, I work almost as cheap as a “new American;” call me!), I’d say they’ve forgotten to properly teach the great unwashedhowto want.  The old “American Dream” of material prosperity worked great for a while, but now even ghetto dwellers have plasma tvs and diabetes.  Something else needs to stand in for “national greatness,” i.e. something that only the managerial elite can lead us to.  For most English kings, it was a war with France.  For the British in India, it was a big fancy durbar.  The czars stuck it to the Turks, and the French brought civilization to Africa.  “Free” prescription drugs and random cruise-missile strikes just don’t turn the proletariat’s crank on a deep emotional level.  I’d suggest something like a space program — they’ve floated that trial balloon already; they should follow up.  It’ll make America great again, and you can staff all kinds of meaningless side project with Islamic transsexual illegal immigrants of color.

        It is hard to know what is meant here by “Romantics” as it is a much abused and overused term, but I would suggest that in the historical political and philosophical sense, and perhaps a literary sense as well, that the so called “Progressives” are actually the “Romantics” and not their opponents. The late Florence King make this point succinctly  about the Boomers in general  (see &amp;http://www.nationalreview.com/article/369371/garrulous-generation-florence-king?target=author&amp;tid=901405&amp;amp;, but I suggest that her critique could be aptly applied to the Progressives as well.In fact it is they who are reactionary, if “reactionary” means responding to the present with a solution from an idealized past.  Moreover, the progressive, when not motivated by personal or collective gain, or the the rationalization there of, is mostly motivated by casting blame for their conditions on any people places or eras they think they can get away with, and their attacks are generally based on falsehood, propaganda and bad faith. It amounts to a mixture of willful ignorance, arrogance, narcissism and irresponsibility. It has very little to do with any “future” real or imagined, as the disingenuous nature of their assaults richly show.

        They have a reason. It is that they will manage things better than we can, and we cannot be trusted to be free.
