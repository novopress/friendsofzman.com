        ‚Äú Jones was tagged with a billion in damages for saying nutty things about the school shooting in Connecticut.‚Äù
Yup.  Nothing whatsoever odd about that school shooting.
Clearly, Z was otherwise occupied and spent no effort looking at the evidence.  Which has now been scrupulously scrubbed from the www.

        Did citizens of the USSR embrace censorship and crushing dissent (or at least not care about what was happening) as do most people in America?
Good Whites want even more censorship with harsher penalties. They are frustrated that there is any freedom left.
Many bad Whites don‚Äôt really care all than much if they can have guns and grill.
Non whites don‚Äôt care.
We are really talking about a minority of whites who care about this and they are deemed the evil, expendable ones who are getting replaced and persecuted if uppity

        I‚Äôm not convinced that Tucker wasn‚Äôt controlled opposition, anyway.  Obviously, he had to make sure that he just went up to the line and not across, but still. . .when the election was CLEARLY stolen he towed the mainstream line that that was ‚Äúbaseless.‚Äù  I was done with him for a while after that.  Plus, I didn‚Äôt forget his younger years when he was the obnoxious bow-tie guy.It seemed to me that he was just another useful ‚Äúrelease valve‚Äù or ‚Äúlimited hangout‚Äù for all the Normie Grillers.  His viewers can blow their load on how the Left is screwing them over and how Tuck is the last hope for civ-nattery and all that is good and pure.

            Yep. I consider it a measure of how in the bag for the griller narrative one is by how vehemently the concept of a rigged/corrupted election is denied.Hell, Hugh Hewitt (horrible neocon) simply hangs up on such callers to his show.  Calling them nut cases.  He then would announce gratuitously that no such evidence of fraud exists and then turn back to the old ‚Äútry harder, vote harder, we‚Äôll get them next year‚Äù, trope.Now the exquisite irony is that Hugh Hewitt wrote a book during the Obama election titled, ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt cheat if it isn‚Äôt close‚Äù.  The content of the book, of course, outlining cheating scenarios by Dem‚Äôs in elections and the need for all good Rep‚Äôs to get out to vote to counter act such expected Dem shenanigans.  üòâ

            When you wage a war on white people, no matter how clandestinely you try to do it, if you are effective then eventually, inevitably, there comes a point when people start to notice. So sometime after that point is crossed, the controlled opposition will also have to acknowledge it, if it is to be viable controlled opposition.
That‚Äôs pretty much how I saw Tucker.
I don‚Äôt guess we‚Äôre all that far away from ‚Äúthe conservative case for the war on white people‚Äù

                ‚Äúnevitably, there comes a point when people start to notice‚Äù
Limited hangout only works if you can distract or intimidate people from digging a little bit deeper. Worsening economy and disintegrating public order is in the plain sight now, so distrating people from noticing things gets harder and harder every day. There‚Äôs not much left to incentivize obedience with either.
What‚Äôs left is intimidation and totalitarian control of the flow of information.
Soft conttols are for the good times.

        Thought maybe Tuckers problem might be key demos, but apparently not. Crushed  the others in total viewers, but also pretty impressive victory in the 25-54.

        Fox‚Äôs lawsuit is not the same as Alex Jones‚Äô. Fox settled for nearly the amount that the suit was demanding, then they crippled themselves by getting rid of their prime talent. The lawsuit would have hurt, assuming no chance of victory, but the settlement will be fatal.The correct move, if Fox had decided they were going to be railroaded, was going scorched earth. There‚Äôs a ton of material they could have put out, and plenty of Normies who would have listened. They had a defense but they refused to use it.Just like Trump, Fox complained then complied. For them, there is no  ‚Äúoutside the Establishment‚Äù. Alex Jones at least fought.That‚Äôs how it goes in Clown World. Everybody with a chance at victory, folds their hand. Every single time.

            GŒºnner Q: ‚ÄúFox‚Äôs lawsuit is not the same as Alex Jones‚Äô. Fox settled for nearly the amount that the suit was demanding, then they crippled themselves by getting rid of their prime talent.‚ÄùI read Z to be implying/stating that the firing of Tucker was part and parcel of the Dominion settlement [especially implying that perhaps Dominion wouldn‚Äôt accept a settlement which did NOT involve Tucker being fired].Whereas you seem to be implying that the Dominion settlement and the firing of Tucker Carlson were two distinctly different parallel events which had no causal relationship with one another.You might be able to make the argument that Tucker was fired because, s/p the Dominion payout, there simply wouldn‚Äôt have been enough money left to pay Tucker‚Äôs salary, but that contradicts everything I‚Äôve been reading about the affair [which is that (((No True Scotsman Rupert Murdoch))) personally ordered Tucker‚Äôs release].In closing, lemme throw out a fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants conspiracy theory here, just for the sheer fun of it.Suppose the career of (((No True Scotsman Rupert Murdoch))) was MI6‚Äôs contribution to the Five Eyes, and none of Murdoch‚Äôs media empire was ackshually of his own creation [i.e. it was all simply handed to him, quietly &amp; purposefully &amp; methodically over the years, by MI6].Similarly, assume that Dominion Voting Systems was the Cannucks‚Äô contribution to the Five Eyes.And suppose the Five Eyes were having a budget crisis [what with all the drug smuggling money from Mena, Arkansas rapidly losing its value in the face of Bidenflation], and suppose Dominion was now acknowledged by the Five Eyes as being their Crown Jewel, and suppose it was necessary to provide an emergency infusion of funds into the Dominion coffers.Then what better way to move the money than to have (((No True Scotsman Rupert Murdoch))) agree to a fake settlement of a fake lawsuit in order to move a billion dollars into Dominion in broad daylight with the entire herd of mouth-breathing non-inner-monologue-hearing NPCs completely clueless as to what was happening?===============To the extent that all five of the Five Eyes answer to David Barnea &amp; the M0ss@d, you could argue that we really ought to be calling it the Six Eyes, but that would infuriate Barnea &amp; the boyz [to be demoted  down to the same level as the goyim ‚Äì i.e. being thrown into the mud with the swine].

                Money laundering in plain sight is what I‚Äôve been thinking, whether it was for those reasons or others. There is no other explanation for Murdoch to settle so quickly, for such a large amount, except that he genuinely wanted Dominion to have the money.

                I would agree with Z that Tucker‚Äôs firing is probably part of the settlement. That would be a second major difference between the lawsuits: AJ didn‚Äôt push any colleagues under the bus. Let alone for the privilege of a preemptive defeat.

                    I see it as a Win-Win-Win for the Deep State and the Five Eyes [plus of course the Mossad &amp; the Council of the Sanhedrin].They get rid of anti-White-genocide anti-semite Tucker Carlson, and they infuse Dominion with ONE BILLION DOLLARS in capital, so Dominion can go on a buying spree and seize market dominance [likely monopoly status, once the smoke clears].All the state officials, who oversaw the contract bids, and settled on the winners for the election machine contracts, are gonna be like, ‚ÄúUh, uh, bro, uhh, we, uhhh, we signed that ten year contract with ‚ÄòJoe‚Äôs Pizza Delivery &amp; Vote Counting LLC‚Äô ; you ain‚Äôt counting them votes for us.‚ÄùAnd Dominion‚Äôs gonna be like, ‚ÄúWe just purchased Joe‚Äôs Pizza Delivery &amp; Vote Counting LLC, and them contracts belong to us now.

        The regime stopped surprising me a few years ago, after I came to terms with its true nature. Next time it does I will let you know. Still, it is hard to take it seriously. On the one hand, within its geographical realm it is basically all powerful, on the other hand, it is earnestly and fervently hell bent on economically crippling itself with climate wunderwaffen, vibrancy, and degeneracy. If I live as long as my parents did then I will live to see a sharp decline in its power and perhaps its end. If I live as long as my grandparents did, I will see the birth of what comes after. If recent generations living shorter becomes a trend, then I may be spared clown world‚Äôs denouement. Those are all winning scenarios.For some reason Tucker getting fired reminds me of early woke cancel culture victim Jimmy the Greek. Even at my then young age I vaguely understood that it was a kind of seminal moment. It definitely served as a sort of demarcation line, between what one was allowed to say before, and what one was allowed to say after. Everybody got the message.

        Long-time practicing attorney here.Regarding lawfare, the political/legal left developed a highly successful forum/judge shopping litigation technique in the 90s of filing basically identical complaints in multiple friendly jurisdictions, filing a stay of litigation in the cases, then waiting to see which judges the cases were assigned. They would choose the friendliest forum/judge and drop the remaining cases. The case with the friendliest forum/judge would proceed.Forum/judge shopping like this is completely unethical. If a private attorney did this on behalf of a corporate (or private) client, the attorney would likely be disbarred, or at least censured, and sanctioned, and the client would be fined into oblivion. But the left got a pass, as per usual.Regarding corruption in the courts, we are going to have to follow the example of Poland and rid the courts of communist judges, or at least minimize their influence. Given lifetime tenure in the Federal courts, this will require a massive overhaul of the judicial system, reassigning leftist judges to Guam or Nome, and restricting the geographic and subject matter jurisdiction of leaf-leaning circuits. The ninth circuit can have jurisdiction of all Federal cases related to sodomy that arise out of the Tenderloin district, and that‚Äôs it.

            I worked in state court administration, and for a state S.C., for most of the Eighties.  I interacted daily with S.C. justices, other appellate justices, and trial court judges.  Even back then, girls were pouring out of law schools.  I shudder to think what Boalt Hall and Stanford Law now are producing, forty years of intense conditioning and empowerment.  Justices and judges come from law schools, of course . . . typically the higher-profile law schools.When I was young the courts were corrupted merely by bribes and nepotism, but for many decades U.S. courts have been ruined by justices and judges long-since confirmed disciples of the Woke-Fem Religion.I advise men in the U.S. and related nations of Bitchdom to stay as far from a courtroom as they can.  Goes for civil, criminal, and family courts.  All the Prog courts want to do anymore is steal your money and stick you in a windowless concrete box at the bottom of the county courthouse, where you will await the mood and dispositon of the empowered woman who decides your fate.Flee from Babylon, brothers.  She is evil.

                        My understanding is that people with above 620 credit scores will pay 1 point (don‚Äôt know if this means one point higher than before, or simply one point), and people with less 620 credit score will pay 1.75, which is down from 3.5.  So while one is increased and the other decreased, there is still a nominal difference of 0.75.  As far as the larger down payment penalty, seems you could just put less down, and then make a principal payment after the purchase.  But I don‚Äôt know the specifics of the new rule and what shenanigans it involves.

        ‚ÄúFor now, the real power of that iron curtain is that the people on the losing side refuse to believe it is there and instead keep operating under the old rules.‚ÄùI take your point; however, I‚Äôm not sure this is really true. It may have been true 10 years ago, but not anymore.The Covid lockdowns were a bridge too far, and I think many people got a strong subliminal message that law and order didn‚Äôt matter anymore. Most people are no longer playing the game because they believe in it. They are only playing the game because there is nothing else to do while keeping your head down waiting for a new leader, a new system, or some kind of escape route to emerge.It is a subtle but important difference.

            Somewhat of a small, white pill, but I was talking to a somewhat younger normie acquaintance and, unprovoked, expressed their concern that the government was, tdlr, ending as we‚Äôve ever known it and becoming a dictatorship of sorts.  This is someone whose spiciest news consumption is occasionally (maybe) watching Fox News so this was a conclusion drawn chiefly from living their everyday life.

        Lawfare is going to continue, against every Kulak in the US. It is a grifter‚Äôs paradise, now mass grifts against those who cannot fight back, with the full support of the State/Corporate fascist entity. Expect it targeted at you personally, and pretty much anyone who might have supported anyone to the right of Mao. With Carlson gone there is not even a single media voice arguing that this would not be a good idea.Susan Rice was fired as National Security and Domestic Policy advisor, Biden appointed her to both as she could not even pass the Democratic Senate for confirmation in a formal post. It was supposedly done at the behest of Dr. Jill who is now running things fully and is pushing Barry out. Another reason Tucker Carlson had to go ‚Äî Biden polls in the cellar, his ‚Äúmiraculous‚Äù win at 4:30 AM with 120 million votes will choke even normie, particularly if normie is living on the street after ‚Äúreparations‚Äù took his house and car.Rice in particular being fired is the bigger news than Carlson. It means something major is up. When shakeups happen in the White House, it is never good news for us Kulaks. Scary as it is, Rice might have been the ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù in the White House preventing the worst of things. The crackhead in chief, dementia patient, and Dr. Jill, are now running things. [The DNC has ruled out any debates and supports Biden 100%]

            I think Rice is a chameleon so I doubt she was canned for being ‚Äúmoderate,‚Äù i.e. resisting some or another dumb idea from the Jake Sullivan type of people who have no working experience out of political graft (of course this also goes for Rice, she merely has a lengthier pedigree in the occupation).The other explanation is that she bailed‚Äî this would be the truly alarming state of affairs; how bad must things really be, that an exemplar of impressive avarice for executive branch status her whole life would quit on *this* WH? Brings to mind the ironic 4chan buzzphrase about odors and imagination.Then there is the really funny question, self-answering, of who is the more qualified operator, just waiting around for the tap on the shoulder from political titan Brandon, to serve in her stead.

        I worked in the judicial system in the Eighties, interacting with justices and judges daily.  The system already was changing back then, with ideologues gradually taking power via judgeships and changes to administrative rules of court.  Mostly via the influence of women.The evil family court (read, feminist) sistem was developed and implemented during those years.  Even then, girls were pouring outta law schools, and that‚Äôs where judges come from, folks.  From people ‚Äî largely female ‚Äî indoctrinated with decades of woke-fem propaganda.  They are full of righteous indignation and passion by the time they reach the bench.  Guess which demographic offends and enrages them, given that this demographic is the source of all evil?  Guess what happens to you if you are a man, appearing in front of them?  Usually while you are in chains.In the good old days when I was young, the courts were merely corrupted by bribery and nepotism, most of that limited to urban areas.  In the smaller towns you couldn‚Äôt get away with much thuggery from the bench, because if you railroaded some dood‚Äôs son, the men of the town would be at your house that night, not looking to talk.Now, the courts and the judicial system in general are ruled by the Woke-Fem anti-culture surrounding them, of which air they daily breathe . . . they are a part of the Regime‚Äôs Establishment.  Z is incorrect that the main motivation of these judges and justices is ‚Äòmoving up‚Äô.  Yes, this is one motivation but in truth, few current court officers need motivation in order to make their courtrooms star-chambers of the Regime.  They are pleased and willing members of the Regime, sure that they are on the side of both history and the angels.  Beware! as they are terribly, sadistically passionate about their religion.  Ask me how I know.Z‚Äôs Iron Curtain fell gradually, over decades, like a shadow upon the land.

            And they attack their fathers, mentors and husband‚Äôs almost like they never cared for them in the beginning. And their malw colleagues and relatives allow it to happen and reward them. The dumbest thing in the world. Kennedy and Lucas is just one idiotic example. If you‚Äôre close to these types, how disgusting is the interaction? AWFLs are the absolute worst in this day and age in my opinion.

            Embittered MGTOW tier guys are not people the right should be listening to.They do not have a program they only have personal grievances.  Sorry personally for their life choices and subsequent life outcomes but these men are an exact analog for the jilted man hating blue haired feminist type.Next rack and a smile they encounter theyll run after and simp just as hard as they did for whatever ‚Äúevil bitch of an ex!‚Äù they last ran after and are currently blaming for all their problems.We need healthy culture and a healthy families and making enemies in our own households with our own women (pretty much the only natural allies we have) is not a path forward.

        Megyn Kelley said she thought Tucker‚Äôs firing was primarily a business decision. The big brands refused to advertise on Tucker‚Äôs show, so the Murdochs sacrificed ratings for what they anticipate will be a larger bottom line from the 8 p.m. weekday slot. Maybe they canned Tucker for other reasons discussed here, but as a poster pointed out, Black Rock/Vanguard has a stake in Dominion and Fox so the settlement or the damages might be a wash for both.People noticed that after Tucker played the first of the J6 tapes, no more tapes followed. It‚Äôs possible that the regime decided that FOX had crossed the line in allowing and told the Murdochs, at literal or figurative gunpoint, that Tucker had to go. Laura Ingraham would be next except her angle stumps for a hopeless Republican wish list which isn‚Äôt dangerous while Hannity is a clown of no threat to anyone.

            Given that Tucker replaced *her* there might be a wee bit of schadenfreude on her part.  As for ad revenue: it‚Äôs peanuts compared to the cable fees baked into the cake for everybody with a subscription, whether they watch or not.

        Please don‚Äôt ask me how I know this, but sometimes it‚Äôs not that the game is rigged, rather, it‚Äôs that playing the game is a tacit admission of guilt, justly or not. And sometimes it takes the desperation that comes from overcoming the fear of destruction‚Äî when destruction seems certain‚Äî to understand what that statement really means. Fear is the mind-killer and the weapon, but the ordeals it puts you in often evaporate like morning fog when you get over it. Fear is palpable today, but I hope and trust it will give way to desperation, because what‚Äôs needed today is desperation and the clarity it brings. The narrative is much darker than the reality.

        I figured this was inevitable, the dichotomy between him and every other personality at fox was striking. Tucker would be on talking about the decline of the country calling out neocons and then, right after his show ended, Hannity would come on and fellate the very same people that were just being criticized. That had to have been causing friction internally.I remember the one time Hannity attacked Tucker live on air for pointing out Bezos was shilling lockdowns through the Washington Post as Amazon was printing money off of small businesses going under. Leave it to Hannity to defend lockdowns benefiting billionaires under the guise of a free market because ya know the government selectively shutting businesses down is just the invisible hand at work.They should give Bruce Jenner a show on Tucker‚Äôs time slot, all the Murdoch properties like New York Post always use the correct pronouns when discussing trannies and they love interviewing Bruce. It‚Äôd certainly be thematically appropriate given the direction they‚Äôre going in. I jest but it‚Äôs probably only a matter of time before something like that happens.

Hannity is a bootlicking neocon Zionist shill. Nobody screams ‚Äúcontrolled opposition fake conservative‚Äù more than that cuck. I can‚Äôt listen to him at all any more, he practically sickens me.
Jim Traficant (God bless his departed soul) shoved it right up Hannity‚Äôs ass like nobody else before or since. Absolutely classic Traficant:

                Traficant always had balls of steel, I‚Äôve seen many clips of him but never that one. I sometimes wonder if Hannity is a true believer, like George Costanza on Seinfeld saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a lie if you believe it.‚Äù He could certainly fool me with how effortlessly he spouts off bullshit.
A little under a decade before that interview fox was reporting on mossad‚Äôs connection to 9/11 in the US, he of course was working for fox when this aired. In hindsight it‚Äôs amazing that they reported on this at all, it‚Äôs very quaint now.

        They have successfully turned the law from a neutral set of rules into a weapon. The facts of the case do not matter.  One of the big newspapers claimed James Edwards was a grand pubah of some type in the KKK, despite his never having even been a member of the KKK. He had no connection to the KKK whatsoever.  But he did interview David Duke once on his show and so that was close enough for the judge who ruled against him.Cantwell is filing an appeal loaded with racial epithets. I think he should print it out on paper with a full sized  kangaroo watermark.  If he ever gets into court again, wear a T-shirt with Stalin‚Äôs face on the front and a kangaroo on the back.

        Tucker is pretty popular among the young White right. So in this regard, the sacking is for the best. The young need to get the message loud and clear: You‚Äôre at war with the Machine.Otherwise, by the time they wake up, they‚Äôll be old and graying like a lot of us here and too tired to do anything about the situation.The Machine will not stop and for sure they‚Äôre going to bankrupt Twitter next. Gab will come after that. At this rate, we will be sharing samizdat with each other through dead drops at trash cans, just like Thomas Pynchon wrote in ‚ÄúThe Crying of Lot 49‚Äù.

        Note how the entire media operation cheered the lawsuit and cheered Tucker getting fired. At first thought, this is totally bizarre. Tucker got fired after a sitting US senator called for him to be fired (likely, this is optics, and he knew about it beforehand, but optics is everything in politics). In a sane world, this sequence of events would send a shudder down the spine of every single person working in the media, for the very simple reason that anything that happens to one of them can happen to all of them.Obviously, though, they are not the same. The other media personalities see themselves as members of the regime, and their role is to advance its interests. Tucker made them look like fools and idiots and spouted the insanity of the regime, so he was their enemy. Likewise, in a world of anarcho-tyranny, loyalty to the regime matters above all. The media corporations will be protected and safe as long as they say what the regime wants them to say. Fox News, with these moves, is also signaling to the regime that it is submitting fully to the empire. We are moving into dark times very rapidly.

            ‚ÄúThe other media personalities see themselves as members of the regime, and their role is to advance its interests.‚Äù That is probably true of the ones who are CIA assets. Those that are of the personality/celebrity persuasion just see themselves as themselves. They‚Äôll do or say anything to be on the globo-homo teleprompter reader desk. They are a part of the regime, but they don‚Äôt see it that way. They areThose distinctions are different. You raise a good point about the Senator calling for Tucker‚Äôs dismissal.

                    If anything, the desire for status makes them even more loyal to the regime and more eager to submit to its authority. After all, the regime gives them all they have and all they want. There is also that lingering cloud in the back of their mind that the regime could take it away at any time.

Another thought occurs, Z. Tucker wasn‚Äôt the only one that got sacked. I notice that CNN fired Don Lemon too. What was his crime against the regime? By their standards that boy was the pinnacle of human development: black, gay, and a neoliberal zealot.

            I am willing to believe that Don was fired for more mundane business reasons. He wasn‚Äôt a threat to the regime, in fact, he was as you note one of their exemplars. The fact is, he was already demoted and immediately after he made comments afterwards that upset the wine aunts that make up probably 80% of CNN‚Äôs audience at this point. So he was on thin ice already, and I am sure Vivek Ramaswamy has more support in the CNN building than Don does.Think of how incompetent you have to be to be a black homosexual working in media spouting regime talking points, and still lose your job. That is Don Lemon.

            CNN has been losing audience share for years, caught as it is between Fox and MSNBC. Prior network head tried to reverse that by moving further left in an attempt to gain off MSNBC without much success. He‚Äôs since departed, and new owners have been purging some of the more strident left-wing commentators. CNN is actually trying to compete for viewers; Fox is prepared to sacrifice them for the reasons Z has outlined.

        Paraphrasing‚Ä¶ The story went that a group of Dissidents were sitting around bitching about MSNBC, or maybe it was CNN‚Ä¶and a passing chink fresh of the boat from China stopped to laugh at them.‚ÄúWhy are you guys getting bent out of shape over it?

        Agree that there‚Äôs an Iron Curtain, or, more accurately, as Z put in behind the green door piece, we‚Äôve moved to feudal system. What‚Äôs very clear now is that the courts, politics and the economy are no longer free nor fair.But that changes the game, not just for us dirt people but for those on the other side of the curtain. Everyone now understands that you can‚Äôt win playing by the old CivNat rules. For the dirt people, there‚Äôs little choice but peasant uprising (actually taking to the streets and physically challenging the keepers of the system), but I don‚Äôt see much appetite for that, at least for now.What‚Äôs more interesting is how the various factions amongst the Cloud People adjust. For at least 70 years, a certain tribe has been playing the game by the new rules while everyone else was playing by the old rules. This group used bribery, blackmail, and all other sorts of mafia-like methods to gain and hold power.They were wildly successful, but much of that success was based on having no competition. Now, other groups (presumably) waking up to how the new game is played. If the courts or the media or even the business oligarchs can‚Äôt be counted on to play fair, you‚Äôre only choice is to play dirty.Will the FBI or CIA continue to be happy as the Dem‚Äôs toadies? Will the military continue to be happy as the neocon‚Äôs pliant toy? Will the gentile oligarchs continue to be happy as billionaires who have to answer to and, on occasion, grovel to the ADL?Maybe, maybe not. They all have the tools to push back. They may be on the other side of the curtain, but they are as vulnerable as the dirt people is a certain group turns their eye on them. Even in a feudal system, the king was always vulnerable to his lords deciding to replace him.Will new factions arise behind the curtain? Just as in Animal Farm, some Cloud People are more equal than others.

        For what it‚Äôs worth, I personally think that Tucker was actually leaning more towards the Dissident side, but walking the line at Fox.He is a normal guy married with kids. Most right wing personalities always have something weird going on in their family life. Mike Rowe is ‚Äúchildfree‚Äù, Chris Rufo has an Asian wife, JD Vance has an Indian wife, David French enjoys taking BBC, so does Laura Ingraham, etc. But not Tucker.Just personal guess though. I‚Äôve also met lots of people who seemed like Dissidents but who were actually hardcore Grillers. Maybe Tucker would let us all down.I think our elites suspected this too and they were scared. Matt Walsh will be the next on the chopping block, and he is also a normal Christian guy with kids.

            Absolutely. You get so you can tell who is a true believer, who is being leaned on or manipulated‚Ä¶it will be interesting to see what Tucker does. I will bet dollars to donuts Tucker is tapped into Dissident thought‚Ä¶ and realize he is in a very precarious position. In his place I‚Äôd seriously consider retirement and obscurity.

            Don‚Äôt know about that. Somebody posted some excerpts of a Carlson interview with Adam Corrolla. Tucker was full-on colorblind CivNat. He seemed genuinely appalled by the idea of whites thinks and organizing as a group.

                Tucker seems passionate about ‚Äúrace is just skin color.‚Äù  It‚Äôs hard to believe he doesn‚Äôt know about race realism, but maybe that‚Äôs the case.  Or he understands, but just thinks society is better going the colorblind route, same as our friend Steve Sailer.
Tucker appears to have that twinkle in his eye when guests like Candace Owens, Jason Whitlock or Larry Elder are on his show like they‚Äôre ‚Äúproving‚Äù that blacks can be just like us,  if they have fathers and education or whatever.

                You have to remember that Tucker is also insulated from race reality by his money and by his community. He‚Äôs just been disowned and cancelled by his community‚Ä¶ so it will be very interesting to see how things unfold. I won‚Äôt be surprised at all if diversity, Darwin and Murphy don‚Äôt pay him a visit soon. He‚Äôs incurred the wrath of the jews now‚Ä¶ so anything is possible.

            On Fedi one of the last honest leftists noted that the sacking of anti0war, anti-globalist Tucker was a loss for the left as everyone else are just corporate mouth pieces.  Related, it gets kind of tiresome for people who are afraid to mention anything cross about regime policies at work bash Tucker for not being a full-on public dissident.  We‚Äôre talking about a regime that is trying to jail an unfavored, wealthy ex-presidentfor nothingyet Carlson was supposed to be able to walk around with no fear?  He was doing good as it was.

        This is confirmation that the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù, idolized by so many conservatives, doesn‚Äôt exist. Tucker Carlson was the #1 news show in the nation. Firing Tucker in his prime is like the 2010 Patriots firing Tom Brady and replacing him with a rookie.If the market mattered, advertisers would be clamoring to market their products on his show and Tucker would be sought after by all networks.‚ÄúWe‚Äù have known this for a while, but the Tucker case is the first glaring example from the mainstream world. Just build your own satellite network and make your own Fox News if you don‚Äôt like it, I guess.We‚Äôve learned that alot of things don‚Äôt exist since 2016. Free elections, the first amendment, the right to travel, the right to self defence‚Ä¶ etc. They used to say that a private corporation censoring speech isn‚Äôt a violatiom of the first amendment. Now, the feds are directly prosecuting people for their free speech.But yeah, sorry, but your whole country is fake and gay. ‚ÄúConservatives‚Äù are still coming to terms with the fact that they‚Äôve been conned and that their whole worldview doesn‚Äôt exist. Including the free market.

        They are playing for keeps. As bad as the judiciary is now, it is going to get far worse. In the meantime the First American Triumverate of Bush-II, Clinton, Obama are openly sponsoring flights to disperse migrants all over the United States. Similarly Obama‚Äôs new and improved Section 8 is going to work its magic. They just announced a preferred rate for low credit scores and a penalty for high credit scores. The military is fast tracking POC officers. I could go on and on.There are, ‚Äúmoderators‚Äù, all over the mainstream dissident right sites now. The things they are censoring make it clear who the censors are and what won‚Äôt be tolerated. It is the same taboo that Tucker Carlson came right up against in his monologues ‚Äì calling out the war against the American Kulaks.It is astounding how used up, chewed up and spit out Americans have been by constituencies that have had astounding gains that Americans made possible. Thinking back to WWI. Heck only 20 years ago America looked very different. The dressed itself up and made its finest appeal to flyover Americans to go fight in the deserts of the Imperium. Now we are in the opening phases of an open and bare knuckled war against the same people. It is such an incredible betrayal that it beggars belief. People are stunned and it is understandable. We need some smelling salts and succinct explanations and quick, because this evil is only just getting started.

        ‚ÄúFor now, the real power of that iron curtain is that the people on the losing side refuse to believe it is there and instead keep operating under the old rules.‚ÄùIn the case of corrupt dotards such as National Review, they embrace the Iron Curtain. NR never again will be a gatekeeper, but the stooges there are allowed to serve as court stenographers.As to the larger point, the court system in the United States is just as corrupt and trashy as every other aspect of the Regime. I actually think potential litigation was the pretext to sack Tucker after he said Bad Things about trannies over the weekend. The one voice speaking against the catastrophe that is Ukraine has been silenced as icing on the cake.The only question I have is whether cable television viewing will be mandated along with social media use in the near future.

        I don‚Äôt watch TV (and haven‚Äôt in more than 2 decades), so the demise of Fox News is of no consequence to me. But I do understand that normie is going to shit his pants over the firing of his hero Tucker Carlson. He routinely vented and dispersed his anger by raving with Carlson every night, and now that has been taken away, so his anxiety level will soon rise up off the charts. As a result, he will grouse and fart a lot more, but not get off the couch because its the only reality that he knows and he can barely make through the bathroom door anymore.The only thing that will fix any of this is a major collapse event. There will be no change until the environment changes. Its going to take empty shelves at the grocery store and prolonged hunger to move the sheeple toward a real remedy.The Cloud People are orchestrating these events so as foster a genuine civil rebellion, or failing that, manufacture a false flag mock rebellion, and use the ensuing chaos mania to justify going full totalitarian autocracy. But this plan only works if they first get all the alphas to kill each other off (patriots vs LEOs), which is why they are working so hard to get both groups viscerally angry and spitting nails. Then it‚Äôs just a matter of triggering a collision.And then, as in Ukraine currently, you get hundreds of thousands of dead alphas and innocents, and no one left to rid the country of its root problem. The Untermenschen can now be controlled with a few tens of thousands of loyal and ruthless jackboots. It‚Äôs a good plan that history has shown can work quite effectively.But it can also be beaten, and spare us all that death of countless innocents.

        Since the legal system is now a complete joke for normal people, and any trial in the high profile category will almost assuredly be adjudicated in favor of darkness, it‚Äôs a wonder that Rittenhouse beat the rap ‚Äì but most likely only because he didn‚Äôt happen to off any joggers.  However, he is being sued in civil court, so his life can still be made a living hell.It‚Äôs just unbelievable just how corrupt the federal government has become in all facets ‚Äì or at least how blindingly obvious it‚Äôs become ‚Äì to more and more people.  I guess they used to do a better job of hiding the fact.  Now it‚Äôs in our face daily and from all directions.  I‚Äôm sure Joe and Jane normie are going to wake up soon‚Ä¶. LOL.

            Rittenhouse only beat the rap because everything was captured on extensive video and he didn‚Äôt shoot a sacred cow (like you mention).  Had he shot one of the future engineers the negro violence brigades would have been unleashed on the jurors and the judge and forced them into the ‚Äúright decision‚Äù.

                Yup ‚Äì those are the two conditions. One lacking: you are in jail. Note the jogger case. Clearly they were being attacked ‚Äì on video. But they were attacked by the sacred cow.

        The post and comments beg a question.
If lawfare is the tool that will continue to be used to crush the dirt people, what is a viable solution/counter to it?
I tend to alternate/parallel societies. I would like to know what others think.

                    Bartleby the Scrivner:  It‚Äôs also heartening to see one‚Äôs own POV shared and better espoused.  I do not watch tv, but my husband watched Tucker.  When I read of his firing (from a comment here yesterday morning) I knew the regime was tightening the controls.  Whatever ostensible reason given, Carlson touched on untouchable narratives ‚Äì Jan6, fortified elections, legitimacy of the regime.  A line has been drawn.Most people don‚Äôt read, so blogs are still a refuge for now, but personally I expect to see more of those to disappear as well.  People give up heart, or have their families threatened, or are sued into oblivion.   And no one wants to be a martyr for a people so beaten down and willingly compliant.Regardless, it‚Äôs reassuring to know that most here are both cognizant of the import of Tucker‚Äôs firing and understand the futility of relying on magic laws or markets to change anything.

                Was about to bring up the USSR. I well remember in 1989 that it was this untouchable behemoth ‚Äì and then all of a sudden mulleted Deutschers in snow-washed denim were smashing down their wall.
Here‚Äôs a more recent example: last year‚Äôs protests in China led to massive rollback of COVID restrictions. A massive, non-violent protest movement can effect change. There doesn‚Äôt have to be revolutionary violence.

        The interesting part of what happens when every media outlet is so separated from a large portion of the population, from FOX all the way down the conservative streaming personalities, that the only alternative is late-Soviet era relentless cynicism to all media, or surrender to the new order and just going along with the lunacy.Cable news is going off into the sunset along with the elderly demographic, but the big online players that will replace them are just as benign and useless, in many ways even more so. Walsh, the only remotely useful guy in the Daily Wire,  will be removed within the next 3 years, bet on it.The rest of the useful people will be relegated to intellectual ghettos where they can make a living but are safely separated from actually impacting the masses or elites in charge.

            As far as Walsh it won‚Äôt take three years. The last week alone has been a full blitzkreig on him. Demonetized(and eventually cancelled) on Youtube. Hijacked his Twitter account and now access to all DMs , emails and texts also. Either he caves or he will be destroyed.
I still have strong memories of The Purge of Sobran, Buchanan and Francis.  History is rhyming again.

                    Absolutely. So many seem to think that getting a bud light VP temporarily reassigned is winning. TPTB have pushed so far to the extremes that the occasional blip or pushback is nothing compared to how far they have pushed their agenda.

            Interesting. I did not realize he is being purged. It isn‚Äôt for his tranny heresy. It is for his willingness to openly discuss the plight of the American Kulaks. There is a clamp down on the mainstream dissident right sites right now and that is what gets the eye of Sauron and his censors fixed.What I wouldn‚Äôt give to have the WEF mind reader output of Knowles the good Catholic and Walsh the good Protestant (true?) right now.We are witnessing the realization of the great fallacy of classical liberalism ‚Äì being a successful merchant alone as the primary means of power is a massive weakness. Walsh is over at the greatest build your own if you don‚Äôt like it success story, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter.It also shows how wrong Rand was. Her beloved, heroic, individualist industrialists ran away and dropped out. It is not a victory. The rabble of scavengers are more than happy to rule over ashes.

I‚Äôve been thinking along those lines for quite some time. it really is uncanny how accurately she described the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù. People like Fauci, Biden, Hannity, etc seem to come right out of her books. They are practically caricatures of her characters.
You are right though, I haven‚Äôt seen any of her ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù characters showing up yet. I wonder if they ever really existed, or was it just wishful thinking on her part?

                    I don‚Äôt think they showed up, was my point. If I recall correctly, they all dropped out and ran away. It is more a tragic documentary (premonition) than a tale of heroism.Isn‚Äôt it astounding what ballsy, gritty men sailed and mapped the globe, settled untamed continents and yes, conquered them, and in just a couple of generations have completely given up and been conquered? I see San Jose is taking down the statues of Fallon. There is a picture of two burly white construction workers taking down the celebration of their great grandfathers grand victory.It is one of the greatest collapses if not the greatest collapse in history.

                        The actually ending (IIRC) was a collapse of the established State into ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù‚Äîmassive power grid failure with no ability to repair or work around, because no knowledgeable men remained in the society to prop up the government hacks who controlled the country.The names mentioned above are a good, present day, representation of the mediocre ‚Äúyes men‚Äù that thrived in Rand‚Äôs hypothetical society.It was a good read for the time, but implicitly assumed a White ethno-State.  We now have a different variable in the mix‚Äîminority majority of the populace and the accompanying decline of those superior intellectual industrialists Rand was fantasizing about.  All we seem to have these days are tomb robbers who live off of the past endeavors of men whom they can never hope to understand, nor equal.

        It seams to me that the Fox settlement was more a case of that entity finding an excuse to do what ots directors wanted it to do all along.They have the resources to drag this out for decades, and the amount sought for damages was completely laughable.  The further in time from 2020 we get, the heat of that moment lessens.  Eventually Fox would have won.But they didn‚Äôt want to win.Fox was never a ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù outlet, contrary to leftwing propaganda.  They were always aligned with the establishment ‚Äì with a tabloid style that attracted people put off by the staid sanctimony of other media outlets.  The only real difference was one of style, not substance.

                Dominion, albeit I agree that machine tabulation as they provide it, is dangerous and should therefore be changed/eliminated, is not the methodology/reason of the last two election frauds.  Quite simply, it was the old technique of ballot stuffing coupled with voter suppression that did the trick.Here in AZ, the ballots have been counted over and over and give the same result.  It is the validity of these ballots that are in question, and that question can not be answered once the ballots have been placed into the process (into the pile of ‚Äúgood‚Äù ballots).  So, with one exception, all law suits have asked for a *new* election, rather than a switch/replacement of winners.There have been any number of legislative corrections to the current process proposed, passed, and then vetoed at the (Dem) Governor‚Äôs desk.  In fact, our current Governor now has the record for most vetos *ever signed* for legislation by a past Governor‚Äî4 months into her 4 year term!It seems short of a super majority, there will be no progress peacefully correcting the electoral process in this State.  And with a State having 40+ % Hispanics, there never will.  We Will be a one party ruled State as was MX for 70 years.

                    This.   We had blocked windows in the counting stations, drop-boxes, late ballots, video of suitcases pulled out from under tables, observers sent home with counting restarted after midnight.  There‚Äôs no need to *any* of that stuff if the steal was electronic.  Yet despite all that evidence,  it was supposedly Dominion?   And, miscounting leaves an audit trail, but ballots, by the nature of the secret ballot, are inauditable.   Ballot stuffing is the safe way, ballot stuffing is what the evidence says, yet all the talk was of ‚ÄòDominion?‚Äô.  Sounds like a distraction.Naturally Trump, with his unerring knack for political appointment, stood by while Sidney Powell blustered about voting machines, a CIA director supposedly stuck in Germany,and ‚ÄòKraken‚Äô.  She ran down the clock for a month while ballot stuffing evidence was sitting in plain sight.

Agreed. It was a fake right designed to misdirect people disgruntled with the status quo into an alternative that was not really an alternative. And Carlson was probably fake right. Anglin is the real thing ‚Äî but he‚Äôs beyond the pale.

                Will money actually change hands in the Fox/Dominion settlement?
Maybe not.
Maybe the settlement was just another ‚Äúkill the chicken to scare the monkeys‚Äù event.
‚ÄúNormie, dont even think of challenging the official narrative.  You see what happened to Fox News; they had to pay a billion dollars to Dominion.‚Äù
Id be surprised if any money actually changes hands, except maybe to the lawyers.

Come to think of it, one hand washing the other would mean that Murdoch‚Äôs Cloud standing would be the main priority, wouldn‚Äôt it?  Our Dirt world means nothing, nothing at all to the lofty ones.
I lament reading Taki‚Äôs dish on the truly rich, as he sneers at these noveau poseurs.  The old families had humility, decency, and class- that‚Äôs the appreciation borne of living through the occasional real insurrection, I suppose.

        Very solid post today, Zman.‚ÄúFor my friends, everything; for my enemies, the law‚Äù, said Peruvian dictator √ìscar R. Benavides ‚Äì a message the establishment has taken to heart. Frivolous lawsuits called ‚Äúlawfare‚Äù is used to silence dissent, a broad term which also includes conspiracies to battle state election reform legislation.  Targets of lawfare include the organizers of the Charlottesville rally and more than 1,000 people who attended the January 6 rally; defendants go bankrupt trying to defend themselves even if they are found not guilty, the FBI destroys exculpatory evidence, and often judges and juries are biased with D.C. juries that vote 90% Democrat.  The FBI will be embedded in any mainstream or semi-mainstream populist organization, so to attend politically charged public events and rallies is to invite the power of the law to target and destroy you.  Civil lawsuits against Alex Jones and Kanye qualify as lawfare as well.  Another victim of lawfare was General Flynn, who was seen as a threat to the establishment due to his DIA experience and willingness to serve with Trump, and so he was framed by the FBI and spent years defending himself in court.  He even had to sell his house to pay legal bills.An early example of lawfare was the Great Sedition Trial of 1944, used to silence and intimidate prominent anti-communists, and these tactics were pioneered by then-litigator and eventual Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in his 1908 Brandeis brief. Lawfare is used in other contexts too, such as pushing radical gerrymandering modifications nationwide on behalf of the establishment (https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/05/republicans-defeated-eric-holders-nationwide-gerrymandering-plot/) , or to paralyze opponents (i.e. a Hawaiian district court judge (!!) who issued a nationwide injunction against Trump‚Äôs travel ban).

            Re: Tucker, my gut says its bad that the last populist on cable TV talking to the dumb boomers has been silenced, but I don‚Äôt feel that bad about it. The top execs at Fox are far-leftist shitlibs ‚Äî including the Murdoch sons ‚Äî and this was always just going to be a matter of time. I generally prefer it when someone or something‚Äôs reputation matches up with reality, and the sad fact is that Fox let Tucker build up audience trust during the off-season in order to turn the screw and cash in on the accumulated reputational capital during key moments, such as Fox being the first one to call the 2020 election ‚Äî quite early ‚Äî for Dementia Joe (during the multi-hour pause when the shitlibs were busy ballot stuffing). Now the boomers can understand Fox is corrupted and controlled just like all the others and hopefully they‚Äôll stop putting their faith in it.

        Tucker fired from FOX is a glass half full situation. He‚Äôs now officially martyred and millions of fans will follow him to whatever platform he deems to use next. Rogan‚Äôs spotify deal will be dwarfed.

                    He has something like five kids, right? I can‚Äôt imagine anyone with even a shred of love for his kids, who would be willing to put them (and a wife that he actually loves) through a Presidential campaign.

            The divide keeps widening.  Since cable news is part of the regime media, it‚Äôs good to see it damaged with Tucker‚Äôs firing.  I hope he goes the alternative online route rather than signing on with Newsmax or OAN or something.
Dumb boomer conservatives tend to trust cable news over online independent sources.  Shaking up their ossified views would be good to see, along with the cancellation of millions of cable subscriptions.

            Jan, who are Tucker‚Äôs followers?  TV viewers.  If they were Internet savvy, they‚Äôd have woken up years ago.  Will they follow Tucker if his only reach is the reach is now through the internet?  We shall see.

        Maybe I‚Äôm too far gone on blackpills but‚Ä¶  I see it the other way around.  Fox settled that lawsuit rather than fight because they might have won and uncovered all kinds of things in the discovery process.
Getting that close to the truth of our election scams scared everyone involved.  So they ‚Äúsettled‚Äù for a big amount which will be drastically reduced later, and used it as an excuse to clean house.

        Part of it is treating dc and certain areas as enemy occupied territory. Your relatives and friends who vote dem are to be shunned.  Ruin family events and make it clear you are not on their side and their son or whatever can go die to spread trannyism is ukraine or wherever. Your time and effort is spent with your ideological fellows. There can be no dialog with your ideological opponents at this point especially awfls who would sell you out I a heartbeat for likes and the right to kill their children. If you must forgo all economic activity outside of a VPN in certain states, so be it. Until the current avela corridor mafia and their MBA and urban shits are stripped of power or switch sides, no deal.

            If I remember right, with Douglass Mackey, their juristiction was based on the nutty idea that some of his bits crossed fiber optics cables in New York. This goes beyond nutty to dark farce. And even without the judges nudging the jury (a travesty in itself), you know the average person in these hellholes will rubber stamp whatever the regime wants,
The final nail will be a high profile case where there‚Äôs a holdout in the jury for one of the kangaroo trials, and the full force of the state decidsd to come crashing down on him as a lesson.

                Jurors are routinely doxxed now. This is particularly the case when a white man embraces his inner evil and defends himself against death at the hands of Shitavious. You may have a right to a trial by jurors of your peers, but you do not have the right to a fair trial any longer. I‚Äôve seen stats that indicate the Soviets and Saddam‚Äôs jurists had lower conviction rates than is the case with the federal system in the United States.

                        I get your snark, but really the situation is that most all crimes are waaay overcharged.  For example, the 16 (or 32 counts?) against Trump for payoffs or campaign fraud‚Äîwhatever‚Äîwere from the same act as in multiple payments, which is typical.  Hell when I retired, the State owed me unused sick leave that they paid off over three years.When you‚Äôre a working stiff, you can‚Äôt afford to fight such bullshit charges and an offer of a plea deal seems like a godsend‚Äîprobation for copping to a reduced plea‚Äîeven if innocent.  And of course, a ‚ÄúTyrone‚Äù gets off with probation immediately as he just costs too much to incarcerate and is of no political import to prosecute.
