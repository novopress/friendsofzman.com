        The “Pro-life” faction winning this SCOTUS decision is the ultimate example of the dog catching the car and having no idea what to do next.
Have to hand it to the left on all issues: when they rock their political enemies back on their heels, they push hard for more, more, more.
The right feels embarrassed and wants to apologize for giving their enemies the sads.

            The right has already pushed this issue too much. Most people on the right don’t even agree with draconian bans. Just look at the results of the votes in the Republican states of Kansas and Ohio.

                There is far more money in national politics, and the left made the pivot to state politics while the right was still scratching their butts. In Michigan the left sacralized abortion in our state constitution, utterly massacring pro-lifers. From who I talked to on the inside, the pro-life cause was run by boomers who haven’t changed their political strategy in 20 years.

                    The majority of the population simply doesn’t support draconian bans. Maybe you can scrape together a majority on late-term abortions, but that’s about it. Everybody else is very pragmatic about this issue.

                                In some areas you could get that through, but not at the national level.
Most states would be fine with a post-12 week ban.

                                        That’s every fucking infant and probably toddler. At least you’re consistent in your love of killing the next generation. The crocodile tears from freaks when children are killed while at the same time being pro-abortion is the biggest load of bullshit I see on a day to day basis.

                                            I think it would be funny in a sick way to watch @TN try to survive the first winter on his own. Toss him out on his bum when it’s 20 below, bare-ass naked, best of luck. We could even spot him an MRE, though he wouldn’t extend the same.
Some people have no clue what they are talking about.

                                        Most of Europe bans post 12-15  weeks because we’re obviously at baby. There’s also been probably at least 2 months to make a decision by then. There all sorts of countries that are backwards in every level more civilized about little babies than we are.

They know exactly what they’re doing.  They simply do not care.

The base purpose of life is to reproduce and raise the next generation. Those who promote or argue the opposite are to have their opinions discarded to the trash heap.

                                                If it’s defective, I kill. (Siamese twins, down syndrome, mentally impaired, etc.) If it’s a high school or college girlfriend I knocked up and don’t want to be with the rest of my life, I don’t think I would have too many regrets by killing.
You may not like it, but that’s the majority.

Have you ever considered what kind of miserable life this thing you gave birth to is going to have? Did you ever consider what happens after you depart this Earth and what happens to it?
Did you ever consider what kind of life you’re going to have? Or is feeling smug and superior to everybody else satisfaction enough?

Has an abortion bill ever specified the health of the fetus as a reason to abort? No. There’s a reason for this, such cases are very rare to find and also define. The overwhelming number of abortions are strictly for the mother’s convenience—whatever that is. I’ll leave the father out as my understanding is he doesn’t count for s**t in these matters.

                                                            It turns out that the people who believe that little tiny clumps of cells represent God’s Creation will defend the same for the bigger, old, far more annoying clumps of cells with free will and an Internet connection. At least the tiny ones will be rocking the most adorable little outfits in few months.I don’t want to hear any future BS about being “Catholic and Orthodox” though.

Because I see no base-level Christian charity or outlook on the purpose (Our Lord’s purpose) of a human’s soul on earth, nor any perspective that a kid’s life (even a Down’s syndrome child) has value and purpose.

The implication was that these people simply had no principles short of whatever suited their immediate, personal needs.  He knew, whether you agreed with abortion or not, such people and their “thinking” was dangerous for society.
Now in those days—pre Roe vs Wade—such folk were smart enough to remain quiet about their lack of scruples.  Today they celebrate such and loudly proclaim it.  We are indeed a fallen society.

                                        I have to admit that the appearance of a rolling abortion clinic at the Demon-rat convention surprised even me. You have to wonder who they even thought they were “serving” with that. Are there really that many pregnant sluts at the convention who absolutely positively need to kill that baby TODAY? Clearly the abortion-factory-on-wheels was symbolism for the rabid anti-natal Left. It was still surprising. Can’t you people just drink blood and worship Satan at home like the rest of us?

Dude is weak af, barely a man, and there are far too many like him. Boy does he love watching his sportsball though, his life revolves around it. Even buys and reads books “written” by the basketball nogs. It’s sad af and even sadder for his children. His children are not doing well, and have been physically abused multiple times that I know of, probably a lot more that I never heard about too. This is the price of not being racist or having a spine. Pathetic.

                Needs to be mentioned that the ridiculous partial-birth abortion approval in Ohio came about because no one showed up to vote.  The right tried to frame it as a family-rights issue which was weak sauce, while the baby murdering fanatics showed up because it’s all they think about.  Everyone else,to Z’s point, just didn’t care enough to show up on this issue, but that didn’t keep the hard-left from thinking that everyone cares about the issue as much as they do.

            It was dishonest of elected officials to campaign on “reversing Roe v. Wade” while allowing their most ardent pro-life supporters to cling to the false belief that such a ruling would or could end abortions.Reversing Roe v. Wade was necessary because the 1973 Court granted itself the power to overturn all states’ abortion laws with absolutely no foundation in the Constitution. A Court that could proclaim Roe v. Wade could proclaim literally anything.But that’s by no means a step towards ending abortion. Abortion (in some form) is overwhelmingly popular. The Irish people amended their Constitution in 1983 to ban abortion, that amendment was repealed by a 66% majority in 2018 and the block and street celebrations lasted a week. Deep red states have elected leftist governments solely on the promise to write abortion into their State constitutions.Running a political campaign in the US on the premise of stopping abortion is a formula for defeat. Wanting abortions to be ended is fine. Believing it can be done by voting is ridiculous.And let’s be honest. It IS “all about sex”. Abortion is the necessary corollary to “f*** who you want, when, where, how and how often you want, without regard to prior obligations or commitments, and with zero concern for consequences”. THAT is the ruling ethic of the age, and if that does not change, abortion on demand is inevitble.

        When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe a few years ago, I spent weeks explaining to more left-leaning people I knew that “no, this doesn’t outlaw abortion, but sends it back to the states where it belongs.”It was like planting seeds on fallow ground. They only could hear the words of their hive “THEY’RE BANNING ABORTION! WE’RE GOING TO BE LIVING IN A REAL-LIFE HANDMAID’S TALE!”I learned that trying to utilize facts and reason with these zombies is pointless. It would be like someone trying to rationally disavow me of believing in transubstantiation. It’s a matter of faith and it is for these goons.As for abortion as a political issue, it’s a loser because even somewhat pro-choice people find it monstrous. I think with the Democrats aborting babies has become a sacrament in their evil religion. It’s frightening.But for some reason, middle-aged harpies are obsessed with their “right to choose” if the liars in our media and polling companies are to believed. Why? Most of you have aged out of that game.

            The issue of abortion has already been lost. Like the current war in Ukraine, one side simply doesn’t realize it has lost.The SCOTUS decision changed little, except possibly the aspect of late term infanticide being law of the land. Why?Last I read, it’s estimated that 80% of the abortions were “chemically induced”, basically “the morning after pill”. TMAP or “Plan B” is really not so next day it seems and can induce abortion many days after (just my skimming of literature, we have an MD here to correct my ignorance).Second, my understanding of some recent decisions is that this “Plan B” is available through the mail and as such is not able to be prohibited at State level.Third, I’m not sure there is even a single State able to prohibit abortion via medical procedure. I admit to not keeping up with Alabama and the South. However, as I said, physical abortion is only a bus ticket away. The procedure normally is a simple outpatient procedure at these clinics. (I once used such an outpatient clinic for a hernia repair and was out in time for lunch.)Fourth, many States anticipated the overturn of Roe vs Wade years before it occurred and passed State laws regulating abortion. Usually restricting such to unlimited at 16 weeks or less, then after only with a doctor’s certification of woman’s physical health jeopardy.Arizona was one such State, but the low life, soulless Lefties have now put onto the 2024 ballot a proposed Constitutional referendum which allows abortion for any reason until moment of birth. In short, infanticide. They claim this is not so because you must have an excuse of the “mental health” of the mother. Then they go to allow all sorts of “practitioners” in the medical field to be valid determiners of “mental health”, in short anyone and everyone can validly determine a mother’s mental health. No “Devil’s Advocate” allowed. Sigh.BTW:  Not to drag on an already too lengthy discussion, but for the record and clarity, I am not against abortion per se.

            Yes, I forgot to mention that part in my other post about the abortion van. What point is there in having it? Well, it’s like a chapel on wheels for the twisted Lefty religion. Even if they don’t kill a single baby with it, the presence of it is what matters to the most devout members of the blood cult.

            They only care about the constitution and its supposed rights when it’s convenient for them.  They strongly oppose the constitution when it works against them.  I seriously doubt a single one of the “Founding Fathers” would recognize American law of the 21st century.

                If you’d like to actually hear smoke over the Internet, discuss with a mainstream conservative that 2A is about protecting state sovereignty, not individual rights. That is the Federal government is prohibited from regulating the firearms of individuals (thus the FBI’s division for it should not exist) to protect the state’s right to protect her borders against a Federal government gone bad. The state themselves have every right to regulate firearms to their hearts content.They love that POV.

Btw, abortion is an icky issue, because we all know that it’s really murder and we have allowed it to go on for decades. So we would rather not talk about it.

As to abortion, it should be a local issue. I’m against it, but I’m for letting it be decided at as local a level as possible.

            Abortion is not Murder, but it is a species of homicide.  What makes the pro-abortion crowd so repellant is their celebration of act and deliberate obfuscation of what they are celebrating:  The killing of a human being.
As a side note:  Many of the pro-abortion people would vehemently protest the execution of a violent murderer.  That is utterly irrational and immoral.
Protesting the killing of the innocent unborn and advocating the execution of guilty murderers is morally consistent and normal.

        I’ve posted something similar before, but it reflects crossing the great divide.I used to be a big anti-abortion guy, and I certainly still find it to be a ghoulish act and mortal sin.  It reflects how irredeemable is our society that close to 20% of conceptions are aborted (though down from the Boomer heyday in the 1980s where 33% of conceptions were terminated – 70% of those by white women).But now I’d rather not get in the way of my enemies making a mistake.  I support these shitlib ghouls and poor minorities removing themselves from the gene pool.  Frankly, they should be encouraged to do so.  Same with shitlib parents turning their kids into trannies – they won’t have any grandkids either.If I were Dictator, my abortion policy would be as follows: you get 1 abortion, and when this 1 abortion is performed, you also receive mandatory sterilization.  You’ve proven you are unable to responsibly manage your reproductive system, so you lose it.  If we can identify the inseminator beyond a reasonable doubt, he is also sterilized.  Both involved in the conception would also be sent for re-education through hard labor.

            The elephant in the abortion waiting room is race. Abortion was originally way to reduce black fertility. Then it became a mechanism to reduce lower class fertility, as that was less obvious. Then it became women’s liberation, as that dodged the issue entirely. Regardless of the marketing, abortion remains primarily a way to reduce black fertility. The numbers make that abundantly clear.

                Margaret Sanger’s writings are clear she wanted to reduce lower class fertility across racial lines from the beginning. I suspect the reason black abortion numbers have stayed higher than other races is that they are exceptionally bad at using birth control.  They also seem very comfortable with abortion as a form of birth control.

                I have always said the fastest way for the pro life fanatics to get a global abortion ban forever is to get Republicans to endorse free abortions for Negroes only and build abortion mills in every ghetto next to the liquor store and the pawn shop because “Black Lives Don’t Matter”. The Democrats would move so fast to make abortions illegal it would make your head spin.

Most PP clinics are already in bad neighborhoods/ghettos or easily accessed by bus from them. No worries about “abortion deserts”.

                You probably know it, but a large number of leftists are fully aware today that abortion keeps the black population down. They are cynically casual about it in private but evade the issue publicly. While simultaneously terrifying and brilliant, the Left calculates that it produces more white female voters than culls black ones. It is somewhat analogous to Ceausescu banning abortion to increase the Romanian population while Erick Honecker made it universally accessible to decrease the troublesome German population. Whatever increases the Left’s power is explicitly permitted, whatever decreases it is explicitly prohibited. The United States obviously is even more open to abortion than the communist East Bloc ever was, but it is the same principle at work. That it benefits our people simply is an unavoidable side effect.

                    That’s when you press the point. “If abortion is a fundamental right, and if we care about negros, wouldn’t we want them to have as much access to it as possible?” Not that there’s much to be gained from “winning” these arguments beyond the entertainment value.

                Abortion was only seen as a way to reduce black fertility in the Sanger era. It became a white woman’s issue only after the Pill mainstreamed casual unmarried sex. Women who were either too irresponsible, too stoned or too stupid to use birth control then need abortion to cover for their “mistakes.”It’s true that black women have more abortions per capita than white women, but that is only because they are on average less intelligent than white women.Abortion does not exist in a vacuum (heh, heh, pun intended) independent of birth control and overall fertility rates. Black women may have more abortions, but the fertility rates of white women are below replacement. It is totally absurd for alt-righters to say “Well, I am for abortions because they reduce the number of blacks” when their own white women are not making enough babies to perpetuate their own race.

                We lose way too many white children in the process. Further, black abortion introduces a moral hazard into a community in desperate need of consequences. Where abortion is not easily available, the women might think twice, rather than to use it as birth control.

            Same with shitlib parents turning their kids into trannies – they won’t have any grandkids either.
The difference is abortion eliminates the cancer, and transgenderism allows it to spread for seventy or eighty years. Whatever dystopia exists in twenty years will feature mass murders and serial killing by the sexually mutilated. Every Shitavious fetus flushed down the toilet represents one less problem.

            ArguendoI’ll accept your numbers. I’m guessing that, like today, the shitlib areas heavily skew things. In my community there was one doctor in a 400 mile radius who would perform elective abortions. When he was pressured into leaving, the closest was in Denver.
The US was at that time about 83% white. The 17% had 30% of the abortions. Non-whites were more than twice as likely to murder their kids. And I’d wager there were subsets in that 17% that skewed just as badly. Not excusing, just putting in perspective.

                I agree.  As with all social pathologies, blacks did and do punch above their weight.
But the 70% to white mothers in 1980 is a CDC number.  All told there are tens of millions of whites in my age cohort who don’t exist that probably should.  While Boomers still cry about the 60k left dead in Vietnam.

It goes all the way from Blackhawk Wars (1832) to Freedom’s Sentinel (ended 2021) but skips this whole thing people think we obsess about. I hadn’t even noticed until someone pointed it out to me. Maybe my community had none in it? Possible, I guess.

                            Could be. Guy who worked for me never said a word about it. Just went home one evening and painted his brains on the wall.
But doesn’t pretty much everyone want free shit? I think its probably reasonable to put them ahead of, say, border jumpers or inmates on death row, wouldn’t you? Or free college or free Obamaphones or free Obamacare or free EBT or…
I mean, at least they did SOMETHING one could make a case for having earned it.

                Abortion is a business and where clinics are located is in part based on demand.  Planned Parenthood closed two clinics in Vermont because of low population numbers and the white women in those areas are going to be religious about using birth control.  This is why PP has gone all in on pushing trans insanity on kids.  They have been too successful in their primary business and demand is dropping, transing kids is a huge potential income stream and they are desperate to keep the operation going.

                        It isn’t just greed, but people who make a living working for these groups are very invested in keeping their jobs going.  They believe in what they are doing, but the financial incentives for what they do are an often overlooked factor in analyzing these groups.

Do you want to live in a country where millions of non-whites hate the whites? And with an elite that cheers them on? These threats have nothing to do with economics.
You are blind to our greatest threats.

                                    Now you just sound like someone who doesn’t want their assets to deflate. They took over the system via money and they can lose control of the system via money, plus it would be a great motivator for the people you guys complain about grilling. Either you want change or you don’t, and the status quo economic system has to go. They already hate you, how do you think they’re funded and made loyal. Think!  It’s almost like you think change can happen and your 401k and house value can remain intact 😉

                                        Wrong. They hoovered up assets then inflated. What is deflation going to do to the assets themselves? Nothing. They still have the buildings and stocks and whatnot. All that changes is the valuation. Which gives them a passive loss to offset any gains.
The only reason they don’t want deflation is because they don’t currently own all the things. Once they do, they won’t care. The number itself is meaningless. It’s what it trades for that matters. How many man-hours it buys.

                                            Steve steve steve, its not about them. And actually you’re incorrect, most of the corporations that have consolidated the markets, starting in the 70’s and really picking up pace in the 80’s, also carry the largest amounts of debt. You don’t remember reading around 08 how AT&amp;T couldn’t make payroll without access to the debt markets? And all the people with their heads in the sand would wake up right quick when they couldn’t get money from their bank account eh? Bet you they won’t give two shits about the fake causes they support now if the money spigot gets turned off. Anyways, as i see you have two choices, deflation or hyperinflation. Not really all that different except in one your money goes up in value and nobody has any or your money goes down in value and wheelbarrows of it don’t buy shit. I think alot of people here, our host included, do not understand what the implications of the 2008 crisis was and how we still haven’t emerged from it yet. I suggest you read this if you have any interest. Did the banks offer you 0% interest rates from 08 until 2016? I don’t think so, they weren’t for you, just crumbs for you steve. Think about it, rates at 0% are telling you money has no value. Rates at 0% are telling you that the economy in its current for is bankrupt. Can you explain to me why rates need to be cut while stocks are at 40k, unemployment is at 4.2%? Probably because those numbers are bullshit, just like covid numbers. You think covid was really about a virus and not just the next leg down of the 2008 crisis (which really was just a continuation of the dot com bust)?How much is the government paying in interest on debt with rates at 5% and they’ve been screaming about rate decreases since they hit 3%. We’re bankrupt, and the rest of the world is currently in the process of cutting our life support. If i was a fly on the wall in 2020 here is what i think happened:America: Yo, rest of the world, we need to print a shit ton of money again because ya know, problem my dudes!Everyone but Europe: Go fuck yourself! (i think China is sitting on the fence at the time, default would fuck them, which is why they’ve been unloading treasuries and such for quite some time now)America: COVID BABY!https://fofoa.blogspot.com/2010/09/just-another-hyperinflation-post.html

                                                Lots to go through there. Corporations carrying debt? Well, of course. With interest so low, everyone carried lots of debt, particularly consumers and home buyers. And car buyers. Lots of people took that sweet, sweet 0.9% on a brand new overpriced car they couldn’t afford.
And 0% interest does not mean money has no value, rather that saving has no value. Consume, consume, consume, proles. And they did. They bought streaming services, went to subscription services for most everything, bought their iCrap on credit, etc., and have nothing to show for it.

Sort of.  They don’t want you to save because the cash flow to service the debt must increase.  Plus saving money makes you independent from them, you hate the job your in?  Well if you’ve been saving you can tell them to shove it.  But if you follow the advice they’ve been giving people since at least the 80’s, you’ll be in so much debt you’re basically their slave and have no recourse.

This isn’t 1929, we were a creditor nation back then, along with the rich (when they bought up those assets you mention)  The people ruling us now are what, the 3rd generation from those?  What is that old saying about a family busienss not making it past the 3rd generation? 😉 We’re a debtor nation now, along with the rich. Stop supporting those who hate you.

Perhaps peak oil isn’t real, i don’t know, but i do think we’re going to lose control of the oil market one way or the other so i don’t think it matters much.

            I’ve always argued that abortion should be banned for social reasons. Same with birth control. Back when a woman could get pregnant if she had sex with a guy and that baby was going to be a part of her (and her family’s life) forever, both the woman and the guy got a lot more careful about sex.
In addition, the family put a lot more pressure on the kids because they knew that they’d also be on the hook for caring for the child.

                Yes, the moral hazard issue. Most of the 20th century appears to be dominated by immorality on the sex front. It was in the closet in the first half and of course “free love” by the 1960’s. Regardless of race, the two together allow for avoidance of consequences.

            I was less pragmatic years ago, but at this point I agree with Sulla.  It’s not my kind of people having abortions – its my enemies.  Granted, I don’t have data to prove this culls them effectively – they can make more babies later and perhaps keep them – but it certainly seems like a means to help keep their numbers down.  They bear any moral culpability – not me – so I’ll hold my nose and look away.   (The sterilization idea also makes good sense to me.)That said, some things are just sick, and only a depraved person unworthy to live in a decent society would do them.  One example – this business of “partial-birth” killing of otherwise well-formed kids just weeks away from normal birth…  People willing to do such acts should not be tolerated.  Yeah – I suppose I’m a hypocrite because I can’t offer a rational point to draw the line.  That said, on the sliding scale or horrors that one crosses my threshold, and I stand by it as a matter of preference.Alss, as long as we persist with the stupidity of women having political power we’re stick with a great many social pathologies.

        Abortion is the murder of your child. That’s it. It’s child sacrifice on the alter of material pleasure. Anybody who is for abortion and than cries when a child dies is a liar and a faker. They would have called the killer brave if the child was killed in utero. Women who kill their children are on the level of a murderer serving life. Our society is disgusting when it kills the next generation.  Than again, silents, greatest and boomers have been stealing and harvesting the energy of the young through so many ways for the past 80+ years that it’s almost second nature.

                Capital punishment has fallen off the map because too many people have been proven to have been railroaded after the fact when it’s too late to make a correction.  Either that person has been killed or has languished in jail for 30 years. A state that murders in these marginal circumstantial cases is no better than a murderer himself.

                    Total nonsense and basically a gratuitous assertion.  Capital punishment has fallen off the map because we are a weak society and no longer defend our values with force and vigor.  We simply give them lip service.You like to make bold pronouncements and think that makes you seem smart, but there is most often little behind them to support such conclusion.  Of course, you like to be noticed as in your stated relish of negative votes, the more the better for you.  News flash, anyone can be noticed for being “a bad boy”, an outlier, an oddball.  It take a lot more to be effective persuader of opinion.

                    Since there is no objection to allowing the police to shoot people before they are arrested, or tried, then there is no consistent reason to get upset when an “innocent” person gets executed.
How many “innocent” people are shot by the police?  A lot of people are fine that Ashli Babbitt was summarily executed without trial, but they would be all upset if Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was finally put to death even though his guilt is beyond doubt.

        Once the court ruled that there was a right to get an abortion, and somehow (I’m still baffled) said that right is in the constitution (who the hell went along with that with a straight face? I was barely born, so it’s hard for me to fathom), and that stood for half a century (the really key part), well, there’s no real going back, much as some people would like to. By that ruling standing for half a century, it became normalized, morally acceptable, and even seen as a moral good. You can’t undo that just by reaching the correct constitutional interpretation half a century later. What’s done is done. People expect and demand abortions. We’re a sick society. We’re already well down the road to normalization of sex changes for kids and soon, if not already, rolling that back will be equally impossible. What you permit becomes normal, then moral, then permanent.

        Z is correct insofar as the political calculations go.On a more fundamental level, though, any society that murders healthy fetuses in utero is sick.Western “civilization” has become profoundly anti-natalist. It is official government policy in every western nation to promote abortion, birth control, feminism and sexual hedonism, and to put women into the workplace as capitalist drones. Birthrates among white women throughout the West are below replacement level.The end result is that white civilization is dying out and will be replaced by black and brown civilization. One need not even be religious or Christian to oppose this. It is the squandering of centuries of precious white DNA, the suicide of a great civilization.If you think being a white person in Haiti or Zimbabwe is a good thing, by all means you should encourage white women to have abortions so they can become tattooed lesbian state troopers and soldiers instead of mothers and put an end to their white genetic line. Forever.

                    Can there be a civilization without the written word? Honest question, as I don’t really know the answer. However, the Aztecs and Incas were non-literate. I imagine the Ethiopians were too before the arrival of the Muzz. The subcons, however, were literate.

                        They had hieroglyphs, if you count that. But there were other nonwhite civilizations with the written word — Egyptian, Persian, Babylonian.
Look, I’m all for saying that White, Christian, western Civilization was the superior civilization. Perhaps Africans, American Indians, and Negritos lived in barbaric, un-civilized, tribal conditions, but I would argue that any urban people with a complex social and economic structure are on some level “civilized.”
The culture may rest upon absurd and barbaric mythology, like Aztec sacrifice, but it is nonetheless an urban “civilization.”

                            Fair enough, although Persians were arguably white, and I’m not sure the race of the Babylonians has been determined with great certainty, although I suspect they were at least partially Semitic.

        In my state there is an incessant and obnoxious political abortion ad that must have rolled a half dozen times while watching the local news.  Abortion as a major issue in 2024 – seriously?  The only block that makes a big public deal about it are the cat/wine box  grannies remembering their salad days riding what CH refers to as the cock carousel w/o having had to worry about a nasty pregnancy or shotgun wedding.  Give it up gals, it’s a long way from the 1960’s, 70’s and 80’s – get with the times…

                                Sincere Orthodox and Catholics follow Holy Tradition. yes all of them.It’s almost like maybe there’s no sincere belief whatsoever, but it’s fun to make up stuff until people get a clue. Most Americans are still Protestants so it’s easier to pick on stuff they don’t know about. American Christian intellectual circles are generally Catholic/Orthodox which is probably why it’s attractive to LARP as them.That is, anyway until the Jewish/Death Cult sacrament gets talked about and the truth leaks out.

                        “Why do you ask Me about what is good?”Jesus replied.“There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”“Which ones?” the man asked.Jesus answered,“ ‘Do not murder,do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.’” Matthew 19:17-19Not seeing an exception for “not born yet” on the “do not murder” clause. No, there’s no word for abortion, but it’s the same act applied to unborn child. Pretty sure not killing a tiny infant is also under the “love your neighbor as yourself”.

        The massive fraud of the self-proclaimed “pro-life” movement was exposed in 2016 when prominent leaders turned Never Trump and jumped on the USS Hillary, who almost certainly would have appointed two or three justices who would have overturned ROE. The Left made hay when ROE was overturned but exposed its own vacuity and falsity by avoiding what was really decided and therefore going into individual states to try to legalize abortion. The Bloody Hospital Gown indeed was too valuable to throw away.Also note how the pillars of the “pro-life” movement–the GOP chief among it–was perfectly fine with murdering our sons and tens of millions of innocents abroad for the MIC and fun and profit. The Left, which hypocritically intoned about bodily autonomy, wanted to forcibly inject everyone’s arm with an experimental and dangerous vaccine. Consistency, hobgoblins…Say what you will about Trump, but he handled the issue perfectly from a political standpoint. From our people’s standpoint, though, abortion was a godsend and reduced the black population and other undesirables by the millions. If anything, those in Red States should work tirelessly to legalize abortion and set up so-called clinics in every ghetto and barrio.

        I think women have had the veto on reproduction forever. I try not to think about it too much, because I don’t want to despise the opposite sex. It’s one of those troubling facts that I accept and ignore.
With that said, imo it’s a thing because of women having the vote. It’s an easier argument to have than the fundamental issue, because it’s indirect. The fundamental issue is how much direct political power women should have. That’s the real argument.

        Professional Conservative Inc. just loves purity tests. These tests make their continuous failure justifiable. Abortion is another, along with supporting Ukraine and Israel.The Left conveniently and successfully conflates abortion rights with Girlboss feminism. The Left are not interested in localizing moral/normative issues. They are interested in total victory – shoving their agenda up our butts (literally and figuratively). The nuances of   the Constitution and powers reserved for States enrage them.

            Yesterday someone posted the 990 for Live Action, an anti-abortion group started by Lila Rose.  She is an attractive young woman who plays as a activist online.  It showed they raise about $13 million a year, she takes a salary of $280k and they spend about $25k on actual programs to stop abortions.  If people wanted to look, I doubt this is an outlier among prolife groups.

        Abortion means nothing to me at this point.  Sure, it is barbaric and disgusting, but the only issue that matters and should be talked about is race.  This is the centerpiece of everything, and until folks start accepting the truth about race, nothing else means a thing.Something else to keep in mind when it comes to abortion is the people who are having abortions.  Think about how many more feral negros we’d have if they were no longer able to abort their spawn.I have zero interest in attempting to save people that I have no connection to.  Whatever self destructive actions they take I am in full support of it if it leads to their demise.  I concern myself with White people who want to live in the same society that I do and nothing else matters outside of that.

            I’m with you 100%. I see it as we are in an existential war. Optimizing aspects of the social system like the degree of permissiveness of abortion are questions for AFTER one has made one’s people secure in one’s land. Until then, whatever leads to fewer enemies who will be murdering our people and fewer breeders of future murderers of our people, gets my support.God is the tester. It’s an imperfect world and (by design) we are usually faced with decisions between a bad choice and a worse choice, not between a good choice and a bad choice. Surviving to make any choices at all is priority number 1.

        I’ll bite. I’ve posted my thoughts about this before and continuing the conversation with anyone who remembers I repeat, I believe this issue can be at least as useful in motivating the kind of dogmatic and fanatical self righteousness the enemy is able to summon with it’s various slanders about white supremacy etc. etc. The point is to ratchet up the rhetoric to establish that any compromise or accommodation is unacceptable and that the enemy has no right to even voice their opinions, never mind live as their conscience dictates. Just as the enemy has defined any political opposition as an expression of some unmitigated evil in their moral universe (racism, heterosexuality, self sufficiency etc.) we should be defining them in similar terms relative to our moral universe and establishing that uncompromising framework in as many minds as possible. They are baby-killing, child-molesting vampires who can’t even refrain from sexuality mutilating their victims and ululating in celebration of their inhuman cruelty and depravity in the public square. They flood our lands with marauding barbarians set let loose to plunder, rape and murder and otherwise terrorize the citizenry. They hate and fear any independence or meaningful freedom to a degree that makes them the object of wonder and derision by contemporary Chicoms and former KGB officers. None of these statements are even hyperbole.

        Inasmuch as America is stone-cold dead, whether or not a national ban on abortion is un-American is otiose. At any rate, these pro-life conservatives are merely doing what the New Left has always done–bleating on about “muh principles” until they get the decisive upper hand, and then abandoning them (viz the matter of free speech). For such people, principles are a means, not an end. And, as much as it pains me to say it, such an approach has much to recommend it.

        This explains the question brought up yesterday- what the heck happened to Christianity?
It was turned into a marketing franchise, like sports teams were.They used to represent the town, the players, but now they represent the marketing.
Social Gospel progressivism, Evangelical conservatism- two wings of the marketing bird.

        Professional Evangelicals, professional social conservatives and the usual suspects have abandoned their old federalist principles in favor of a national abortion ban, because they think it is good for business
Isn’t that just a tad bit too cynical? Surelysomeof them sincerely believe that babies should not be murdered as a general principle.

        We don’t disagree on this one, but it’s like you’re saying, in the minds of many, murder is a local issue.Although you’re not wrong on the game being played, it’s equally funny how “dissident” or alt-right influencers pivot between centralization and de-centralization when its strategically convenient, similar to how you describe the abortion ban.What you get is Trump a’okay with a national ban on bump stocks despite the 2A being enshrined but against an abortion ban (via Thiel’s puppet Vance) at the federal level.This pivoting by “dissidents” oddly seems to correlate with what’s advantageous for what Z gave love to “the Global Cosmopolitan Right,” aka wanna-be technocrats and manufactured fakes like Thiel and Musk.

            That’s essentially the argument I hear, and it’s a strong one. The truth is our culture is so rotten it’s impossible to gain power by conventional means without getting dirty, and impossible to vote without getting a little dirty yourself.
What social conservatives need to understand is you can get dirty, or leave the system and build your own, which involves getting REALLY dirty when the State comes for you.

                You may be missing my point. “They” are against an abortion ban because de-centralization favors technocrats on this issue. However, “they” favor bump stock bans through centralization because it favors technocrats.Think Covid: pushed forward by the Father of the Beauty Vaccine through centralization by technocrats but scapegoated through de-centralization at the state and local level. In the end, this allows the Global Cosmo Right to present Donny or Vance as outsiders when they’re not. They’re deeply in bed with fascistic technocrats creating a police state.In fairness, Z has directly stated he did not support the bump stock ban. (https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=13049) However, he continues to support fakes like Donny, Musk, etc. despite their love for technocratic solutions.

            Murder is a local issue. That was the point of the joke in the ’80s. “So Massachusetts now has capital punishment. That’s kind of a hassle. Now if you want to kill someone you have to go up to New Hampshire or down to Rhode Island.”

                I knew someone would say this the second I wrote my comment the way I worded it. Again, I don’t necessarily disagree. However, murder, generally speaking, is illegal in all 50 states and at the federal level. Additionally, does anyone doubt that the federal govt would invoke constitutional authority against any state if they tried to make it legit legal?

                    Agreed. I suspect they would 14th Amendment it, with probably only Thomas dissenting.
The Constitution is dead. The Left knows it, but uses the Right’s refusal to believe their lying eyes to exploit it when it suits their purposes.

                    The easiest way to understand this is to consider wrongful acts as classified as “malum prohibitum” or “malum in se” based on their inherent nature or the basis for their prohibition.1.	Malum Prohibitum:•	Definition: An act that is considered wrong because it is prohibited by law, not necessarily because it is inherently immoral or evil.•	Characteristics: These acts are criminalized through legislation, and their wrongfulness is dependent on the fact that they violate a specific law or regulation.•	Examples:•	Traffic violations, like speeding.•	Regulatory offenses, such as failing to file taxes on time.•	Licensing violations, like operating a business without the required permits.•	Implications: The wrongfulness of malum prohibitum acts is not based on moral grounds but on legal prohibition. The intent behind these laws is often to maintain public order, safety, or welfare.2.	Malum in Se:•	Definition: An act that is considered inherently wrong or evil by its very nature, regardless of whether it is prohibited by law.•	Characteristics: These acts are universally recognized as morally reprehensible, and their wrongfulness is intrinsic, meaning they would be wrong even without a law prohibiting them.•	Examples:•	Murder.•	Theft.•	Rape.•	Arson.•	Implications: Malum in se offenses are typically considered more serious because they violate fundamental moral principles. Laws prohibiting these acts are often seen as reinforcing societal norms of right and wrong.In summary, malum prohibitum refers to acts that are wrong because they are legally prohibited, while malum in se refers to acts that are wrong in and of themselves, regardless of the law.(The above has a lot of cut ‘n paste.  I am no legal scholar, but the concepts are helpful to me in understanding why some acts are universally repugnant to most all people and cultures.  In the present case, there would/could never be a situation in which States decide that “murder” was legal. As such an act is malum in se.)

            Very few pro-life people in the movement are willing to stand up and say “we do not support abortion because it is murder.” I think they’re scared to do it because of the obvious implications (a woman who goes to PP to get an abortion is guilty of first degree murder). It is how you get rhetoric at the DNC like “we support Americans’ ability to make choices, even if they are ones we would not make.” As you point out, no Democrat believes that people have a choice to murder their brother or murder their mother, even if they wouldn’t choose to murder them. Rhetoric like this only works if you feel that abortion is not actually murdering a child.If the pro-life people at the top of the movement were actually sincere in their beliefs, and not running a grift, then they would be pushing the window in this direction. They would be forcing Dems to discuss why they think it should be legal to kill children. They would be using metaphysical arguments about why a baby in the woman is a life from the moment of conception. Etc. After all, this is what the left does in their arguments on the right. For example, they are tying every single thing in Project 2025 to Trump personally, and saying that every single thing in there will become law if Trump wins. Even as he disavows it. But the conservatives don’t do that.

                Problem is the audience—at least some here.  One can postulate a hypothetical without promoting it or believing it oneself.  When I was an undergraduate, the prof’s often called it a “thought experiment”.  Good gawd folks, no one assumed the class instructor was promoting an idea or teaching it as fact or belief, rather he was using a manner/tool of critical thinking about an issue.  None of us left class grousing at the prof.

People are not in situation to really have debates until their late 20s. 18 feels old, but it’s nothing compared to someone with another 10 years of adult experience.Honestly, this is form of propagandizing. It may have not be conscience or malicious, but it absolutely is. Your professors had ideas they wanted you to believe. It just required taking their “surmises” seriously.That has nothing to do however with Z’s blog, which he can run as he likes.

                    Right, although it behooves the one conducting the thought experiment to make it clear that’s what he’s doing. Failure to do so encourages participants to believe the prof (writer) advocates what he’s saying.

                        I can see the concern with a prof, because he has the whip hand in determining your grade, and maybe even your diploma. Similar with a supervisor, where you could be unemployed tomorrow. But in a community? Barring life and death situations, isn’t pursuit of the truth generally more important than figuring out where each person stands?

                    Yep. I often argue positions I don’t really hold, but which have been bouncing around in my head, just to get some feedback and tease out the weaknesses. Aren’t most here doing that? Do you think even a plurality of the arguments are sincerely held positions?

                        Correct. In the present discussion, I don’t believe I’ve said one positive thing wrt abortion. However, if you simply ask, “Compsci do you believe abortion should be made illegal?” I would unreservedly say “no”!
The question of abortion is much, much more nuanced that any comments or series of comments have delved into here. Many touch upon salient aspects to be sure, but 100 word comments won’t get us to conclusion—much less full understanding.

        Assuming abortion is murder and is no different than killing a child after birth, what would we say if in some jurisdictions parents could bring a child to the doctor to be euthanized up to the age of majority?Would we say leave it up to the states?It seems that most people assume that abortion is, at worst, still not quite the same as killing your children after they are born.That’s fine, but then you’re still making that same judgment about the level of immorality of abortion while pretending to avoid it.In other words, if abortion really is murder, you wouldn’t say “leave it up to the states.”

        It remains to be seen how big a factor the abortion issue will be in bringing out women who vote inconsistently to vote in November.  I am convinced it helped the Democrats in close races in 2022.  We have to remember if everyone person eligible cast a ballot, the electorate would be so bad, we would have candidates running to the left of Kamala and Tim Walz.  Harris said 220 million Americans died of Covid, the innumeracy being lost on both her and the wider electorate.  The average voter is really dumb, and in a state as large as Pennsylvania, 15-20,000 women showing up because of abortion is a possibility and could be a tipping point.  I remember the line the women in 2016 putting their “I voted” stickers at Susan B. Anthony’s grave.  We underestimate this at our peril.

            Abortion is a visceral issue for women, literally. Even women who disapprove know that they are always just an inconvenient pregnancy away from poverty and loneliness (high value men generally don’t want to waste their resources on other men’s children).
There really is no getting around this. Abortion is repugnant, but it will ultimately be legal in any society where women have the right to vote.
I know how I would solve that problem, and many others as well.

                It fits the general personality of women to a T, just another way to shirk responsibility (yes i know some women have no problem with responsibilty but i’m talking about the majority).  Ever notice when a relationship ends the worse type of people always blame their partner, while realistic people say relationships are 50/50?

        Well stated. I’d prefer to live in a world where no mother or father would ever imagine the woman getting an abortion. But of course we don’t live in such a world. In the real world, there are plenty of people who think getting an abortion is a good idea. If you make it impossible to get an abortion, then those reprobates with the inclination to kill their children will instead be raising those children, and turning them into monsters.

            It’s not only that. For better or worse, I see most of the crazies who are anti-abortion as Roman Catholics. 1/3 of the country is Roman Catholic and not even all of them agree with abortion bans. Let’s say only 1/2 of Roman Catholics are holy rollers on this subject, a number which is probably greatly exaggerated. 1/6 of this country shouldn’t be able to impose their dogma on the rest of the country.

                    The gun and abortion issues are like non-Newtonian fluids. When you apply force they become solid. The public is tired of hearing about them, and they really wouldn’t mind if access was restricted a bit, but they want to know they can get access to both if they feel it’s a life or death issue. I think state level is as good as the pro-life forces can hope to achieve.

I’m not sure most people demand even that. “Life of the mother” is always valid; it’s just that one might be brought into court to prove it, like any other instance of self-defense. Why should the standard be higher for killing some ghetto rat robbing a liquor store than for killing an obviously helpless innocent?

        As inflation soars and money gets tight for most Americans, only the Boomers have spare change to offer the ConInc crazies. And since the Boomers are now dying off rapidly thanks to the death jab, that grift is losing its mojo. At the DNC  Convention in Chicago, they had a mobile clinic in the parking lot offering free abortions. One side wants to ban abortions everywhere and the other side wants to mandate it. How far we have fallen.

The vaccine appears to be having the exact opposite of the intended effect. It did damage young people. However, it’s giving Boomers cancers. I can name several in a circle of acquaintances.

                I can name 3 aggressive, Stage 4 in my relatively small extended family, none over the age of 30, and 1 Stage 4 who was 92. One of them turned 18 the other day, and the docs only give him even odds of making 19.

                    One needs to note the aspect of dying young is much more poignant when one thinks of years of life lost and how more important those lives cut short in youth are to society.  Old people are going to die—today, tomorrow, 5 years from now—does it matter?  Speeded up death in old age from the vexxine is masked for the most part—although oddball disease occurrence is noticeable, ask a mortician.

        I think part of the response of the GOPe to the new post-Roe landscape is also due to the fact that they’re still working behind the scenes to throw the election to Harris.  Back in 2022, when the “red wave” didn’t materialize because of widespread voter fraud in all the same states that got “fortified” in 2020 the hot take by the Conservative Industrial Complex was that the GOP was just too extreme on abortion and that cost them the election.  They are of course not allowed to discuss voter fraud and they don’t want to have to defend pro-life positions at the cocktail parties they attend, so “moderation” was clearly the way to go.  Then when Trump came out and basically said “I agree.  I’m kind of moderate on this issue too.” all of a sudden the call went out from the GOP to start drafting a nation-wide abortion ban.  I suspect that in the bubble they live in they really have convinced themselves that abortion was a major reason they lost seats in 2022.  Talking up a nation-wide ban therefore in their minds is a way to turn voters off the GOP and cost Trump this year’s election.

            Trump substantially outperforms the GOP itself. If politics still meant anything, and they do not, a legitimate political party would make adjustments to reflect one of its more popular members. But, no. I suspect the primary reason is the GOP power structure grifts so heavily off the MIC, and to Trump’s credit he is not a warmonger (Israel excepted somewhat).
I would greatly enjoy hearing a pledge from Trump never to impose a draft just to watch the Republican meltdown. Probably won’t happen, of course.

        Pro lifers lose a lot of people  because they don’t distinguish terminating a healthy fetus with terminating a fetus with severe disabilities that will either cause it to die later and/or will bring it misery and misery to the parents.
But yes, abortion IS killing of human life full stop.  Anyone who doesn’t admit that is liar or fool.

        I can’t believe they pivoted off of state’s rights into a federal position on the issue. Seems like a really stupid move, and it definitely pissed off the pro-life political organizations, which do seem to have some legitimate sway and a very devoted base, even if they can’t get broad support on the issue.Most people are moderate, no contraception bans but also no sick crap like allowing abortions after the 5th month or w/e. Trump could have easily just stuck to his previous position.Girls notice if they miss their periods very quickly. Some of them have less consistent cycles but I don’t buy that any would not notice for three full months. My gf freaks out when it’s like 5 days late.It’s more of a distraction issue I think. Society already has a broad consensus on the moderate position. Even Iran allows abortions if the baby has some kind of debilitating genetic disorder or poses risk to the mother’s life.This all or nothing crap is pure pollical theatre meant to distract Americans from real issues.

        I’m adding a 2nd comment to show how, imho, Z very quietly shifts issues to get you to accept progressive, technocratic policy.Like with yesterday’s post on how Christianity must adapt because it’s already been corrupted, I believe, it’s an attempt to get you to accept your own demoralization after decades of relentless culture wars.Think: what was the polling on abortion in 1950 or 1970? Did only a minor number, like today, few it as a big issue? Or has it only become such a niche issue after decades of being legal and encouraged?You can look up the polling.

        Good gravy let it be tribal!Trump delivered his end and Pro-Life Inc. will never forgive him for iti knew a lot of these people when I lived in Casablanca. I dated a girl who worked in PLI, and guess what? It was filled with homosexuals. Kid you not.I always had feeling it was a racket. They were all making a living in the fight. If the fight went away, it’s the Home Depot. They loved to be viewed as big hero’s. I got sick of it.Lila rose was a perfect example. A young woman who should be making dinner is this international public figure. Not a role for a young woman. But she was popular and made money. I think she is still in the game “taking the fight to the next  level”. It’s very similar to leftist sjw stuff. “We’ve come a long way, but we have a long way to go”im glad roe was overturned. It seemed to me the mark of Cain. But now I could care less. While I have family obligations in the state I live, I may move to a conservative one that doesn’t have the brutal practice but I may not.good post

        Proof positive it’s all about the grift.I mentioned the demands for a total ban are the Republican finks betraying natural conservatives; why they do this is, they are pre-screening their customers. Every decent con man qualifies his customers.Emails by Nigerian princes, for instance, are badly written or misspelled on purpose.They want only the most gullible to respond. This separates the wheat from the chaff, so to speak.(Note, before assuming they want only the most stupid, IQ wise, not exactly true; temperment, rather than IQ, is a better descriptor.)More proof: Jerry Whats-his-name, the Moral Majority guy, raised $100 million to fight for the pro-life cause in the 80s(!)…and did nothing with it. Yes, he’s also the guy who got a jet gratis from our favorite little country, because one should learn from the best.

        Two percent ain’t much but could be critical in close elections. The GOP should emphasize a moderate (i.e., unprincipled) position on abortion, with a reasonable time limit, which most people agree with. That would leave the partial birth abortion fanatics looking like what they are: anti-human monsters.

        Abortion is the flip side of gun rights. It is a male/female divide based on both control of their own destiny, and hatred of the other sex.You see 75 year old grannies screeching about abortion. What they are really screeching about is the hate that any woman would have to bear the kid of a beta male, particularly from one who “fooled” her that he was Alpha when he was not. This is the whole point of abortion. No kids from beta males.There is a guy on YT, “hoe_math” who features often female videos explaining the women’s hate hate hate for the beta male. There is one notable one where a woman, no longer quite so young, screams in fury over her hate hate hate of beta males that women have to settle for and her desire for the Alpha. [The guy is a proto-Roissy, its funny that life keeps creating that person the way evolution keeps creating crab variants over and over again.]In the same vein, women HATE HATE HATE the idea of ordinary men defending themselves from the Alpha packs of feral vibrants. Thus it is women who push gun bans along with abortion up to 10 years (a serious proposal not just a Black Mirror episode].Women hate hate hate guns because it puts the most beta male dude on the level of “Bix Nood” and his ten buddies consisting of a wolf-pack.Kamala Harris has said she will enact gun confiscation upon being elected, by Executive Order. That is the wedge issue in reverse.—OT: I think the weirdness with the NYC Trump sentencing is the Plan B if Trump wins, ala Macron. [They won, I govern]. Judge Merchan whose daughter raises money for Kamala sentences Trump to prison immediately on early December, Biden arrests Vance on something, anything, well gosh darn it, turns out Kamala WILL be President. And just to sweeten the pot, declare an immediate draft (Straight White men only) for both the Russian Front (younger man) and war production (older ones). Trump probably will not last a day in prison (that is the plan naturally) and his stuff he’s got (likely on Obama, mostly) will go out on Twitter, but Musk will be extradited to the UK so fast you won’t be able to say Pavel Durov. DoJ takes over Twitter and Space X, Tesla, mass arrests ala UK, “chaos restored” as normal. The stakes are literally life and death for Musk RFK Jr, Gabbard, Theil, Dimon, Dalio, and Ackman. But that seems to be the play — jail Trump immediately so he can be Epsteined, mass arrests ala Maduro or Starmer.

            I’m not seeing where the beta male is hating anybody in this equation, and you didn’t say. Of course he wants to defend himself from ferals, what sane person doesn’t?If the beta male hates women that’s news to me. More often he is a simp.He does seem to have this misplaced Braveheart view of how he and his firearm, together with his fellows, are a threat to the regime, but that’s another subject.

            I respectfully disagree.  Abortion is really about the “empowerment” of girl boss who can fu$k whoever she wants, when she wants, and not have to be “burdened” with unintended consequences which would be much better suited if she had a man to help her.  “I don’t need a man, and if I get knocked up, I’ll just get rid of it!

        A pattern emerges: Whenever anyone on the right gets mad at Trump because he softened on their pet issue, they call Trump a cuck and rage. But when someone else does the same over an issue they personally don’t care about, they wag their finger and call them childish and disloyal.In 2020, ZMan blocked me on Gab because he was blackpilling on Trump over something or other and I told him to get a grip. Yesterday, he blocked me on X because I said I was done with Trump over the abortion cucking. The difference? Well, cucking is okay with ZMan when it’s on an issue he doesn’t really care about, and not okay when it’s an issue that he does.LOL.

            Everyone makes mistakes, that’s why they put erasers on lead pencils, BUT abortion should be a one time serious consideration not a form of birth control. Yes, 11 year olds do get raped by their grandfathers, yes 50 year old women going through menopause sometimes have accidents, yes teenage girls get pressured into sex by teenage boys who want nothing further than a quickie under the bleachers on Saturday night. And on that subject, if pregnancy possibility is a concern, there’s this thing called band-aid sterilization, no scars no marks, in and out in an hour and it’s permanent. I think women just want a girl issue to screech about.

        Reminder of what I’ve called the Shapiro Strategy (because our friend Ben does it so nakedly): The GOP believes that Trump must be destroyed. In cooperation with the Democrats they’ve tried all kinds of wacky schemes to make the people turn against him, and it turns out it’s not possible. However, America can be reminded thatall other Republicansare repulsive scumbags who don’t represent anybody.All other Republicansmust campaign on that repulsiveness, and maybe Trump will get hurt—his voters depressed, he’s forced to talk about weird shit, minority rages are stoked, etc.—in the crossfire. Promise to take away social security, never let wages catch up to inflation,Indians are your rightful managers, etc.The news today is “Republicans want a federal abortion ban”and“Trump betrays Christians” because Vance is more Shapiro than Shapiro, the worst imaginable Republican, and he played it perfectly. Pussy hats are back in the shops. Ramzpaul said “white women” sixty times in a ten-minute video. Who’s RFK?hands_rubbing.gif

        Strongly disagree with you here on the federal abortion ban. The only reason to oppose it is that it’s political suicide. If we could actually pass such a ban on the entire country, with no loss of power, then we should absolutely go for it 100%. Abortion is murder.

        Imagine if the drug cartels and snuff film fans and pedophiles, etc, all decided to move to Vermont or Wyoming and claim it for their own. A pirate outlaw utopia. Shouldn’t the government get involved at that point, to stop the blatant abuse of states’ rights?The pro-life movement justifiably sees states’ rights as a compete farce on this issue, just as disgraceful as when it was used to defend slavery. Passive aggressive RINO’s won’t ever own up to what they’re doing, defending killing babies.Trump already cucked out on the abortion-tainted vaccines. This might just be the last straw, sending conservative Christians to third parties and economic leftist Christians to the Democrats.

        This abortion discussion today has taught me something very important: Most of you self-styled “dissidents” are nothing of the sort. True dissidents will examine all dogma, pick it apart and throw it out when it makes no sense anymore.. Nothing is sacred to the true dissident. You guys still goosestep to the narratives your betters set for you. Save the Children! LOL
All the boomer initiatives and the dogma which you hold so dear are dead as a doornail. Israel? Nobody in the younger generations cares. Abortion? Same difference.

            This conversation has taught me is that certain topics are very helpful in revealing the truth. There is nothing easier than LARPing on a platform like this, although I can’t think why. There’s nothing to be won or gained by it.Your posts repeat the dogma of the elite who rule over us. The most dissident idea that exists is that abortion might at least be not the best idea, for any number of reasons.

        If the pro-life people got to work on the state level the way they said they would for decades, then we wouldn’t be at this point. Trump would say – correctly – that the decision process for this is playing out at a level that the President and the feds have no business weighing in on. Now, I know that, in the days of the GAE, there is no issue too petty for the feds, but that’s part of the problem. Instead, the pro-life people just gave this to the Dems on the state level and, even worse, are making it a federal issue that the Dems could now run on. It’s such a a beautiful gift for the Dems that I start to wonder if they’re actually on that side. It’s so bad that Trump felt the need to go up there and state publicly he was against it, but he did so in the most clumsy and inelegant manner possible. Trump’s recent comments are not going to make the Dems lay off him on this topic, any more than him denouncing Project 2025 for the 500th time will make them not talk about it.

            That’s not true, though. Several states put or had abortion laws on the book. Arizona had the most restrictive that I know of, so, of course, that got repealed quickly.
If you are from a state with big blue metro areas, it’s easy to assume every state is just like yours.

                Yes and Dems are fighting in those states. You mentioned one. There is a thing on the ballot in Florida. The Dems focused their rhetoric and examples on the states with laws on the books at the DNC, not about how great California is because they allow abortion to the 8.999999999999th month. The pro-life movement basically picked up the victories that were already on the books and then shrugged for the rest. Like, if you value life, then the value of a life in California is not worth less than the value of a life in Louisiana.

But after checking out discussion after discussion where pro-Palis pull the same thing @TN has been doing with, “Where did Jesus say that in exactly the words I will accept”, I’m tempted to google to see if there’s a way I can drop ship bombs to Israel. Not that I’m pro-Israel, I’m just seeing why no muslim country wants the Palis either.

                        I was speaking to what the pro-life lobby has been doing since Dobbs. They basically said, “well there is a law on the books in Mississippi, great, we won there, but California, nothing we can do.” And of course that is patently nonsense from a pro-life stance.Dems aren’t behaving this way. They are targeting their message to women and soys in states with the laws on the books. Their job from their POV is to convince the states to repeal their laws, or get them overridden by the feds. The pro-lifers’ job is actually to get New Yorkers and Californians on their side, as daunting and impossible a task as it seems now, but they aren’t even trying and just letting themselves get rolled. Because, as Z pointed out, they really never thought they would win this.

                That’s not true.  The courts let an old resurrected statue from AZ territorial (pre-Statehood) days (temporarily) contend/conflict with a *current* statue passed in 2020, which gave 15 weeks max to decide on abortion and was slated to become active if the SCOTUS ever overturned Roe vs Wade.The AZ Supremes said they needed time to think about it. So in effect there was no abortion ban period in the State when SCOTUS overturned Roe vs Wade because the Attorney General said there would be no enforcement of any abortion bans during the time when they were deciding which law was to take effect and supersede the other.Now resurrecting a 100 yo law and allowing it to conflict with a 3 yo law was patently absurd and there is the decided oder of mendacity in the air.  The (faux) possibility of a total ban was exactly what the Leftists on the Court wanted!  This gave rise to a panicked populace and has guaranteed a huge turnout at the polls this presidential election cycle.  It also had the effect of the possibility of a Constitutional Amendment (via referendum) allowing late term abortion—over-riding the current 15 week limitation.The State of AZ has never had abortion prohibition since Roe vs Wade, nor was one ever proposed in the legislature.  Odds are we will see the Comstituional amendment passed and late term abortions enshrined.

                    Fair enough. I had gleaned that from the stories, but figured 1) the legislators (or at least someone) had to know about the previous law, and, 2) if they intended the 2020 law replace the old one, once they learned about the existence of the old one, they could have passed a 1 sentence law repealing it rather than passing the buck onto the courts.

        I agree with the Z on this. Most people simply don’t care about the abortion issue. If the lady down the street from me gets an abortion rather than carrying to term, how does that affect me personally? Generally it doesn’t. I think most people prefer to keep it legal. Its an out in case you knock up your girlfriend. Also, from a tax payer standpoint, I much pay the hood rats to get abortions rather than pay to raise the kids for 18 years (and for them to become thugs and hood rats as well). Most people I know share my thoughts on this.Its good to get abortion “depoliticized”.

            “If the lady down the street from me gets an abortion rather than carrying to term, how does that affect me personally?”One abortion does not affect you. But 20% of US kids being aborted, it affects you. Affects the economy, immigration, your retirement, your quality of life. No man is an island.What about the lady having the kid and becoming a mother instead of being a cat lady obsessed with leftist politics. This affects you.You can say that other groups abort more than your group. Fair enough. But they also immigrate more. Every Hispanic kid being aborted is compensated by multiples Hispanic kids immigrating. Every American kid being aborted is compensated by nobody.Then, don’t complain when you end up being a minority in your own country. It did not affect you personally…until it did.A Muslim man would think this way: “If the Muslim lady on the street gets an abortion, this is evil because she is killing a Muslim baby, she is going against Islamic religion and there will be a Muslim person less in the world. This has to be prevented at all costs”. This is a winning strategy as a group and ours is a losing strategy.What you showcase is the fatal flaw that people of Caucasian origin (like me) have. I have seen it all over the world. While other groups help each other, we are always like “Let me alone”, “I got mine, get yours”, “Not in my backyard”, “I don’t need anybody”, “I am proud of my individualism”. Every time something happens, if it does not affect us personally in a direct way, we say “I am good. Let the other people bite the dust”. Then, after decades of looking the other way, the sh*t get us and we are like: “This is not fair! Let somebody do something! I am a victim!”.

            I think one abortion down the street does affect you, in that the moral structure of your community is weakened. One abortion halfway around the globe? Maybe infinitesimally. One abortion halfway across the “country”? Probably not measurably, so long as they are not allowed to impose their (a/im)moral structure on your community.

        Nailed it. In my opinion, licenses for abortion clinics should be doled out the way they are for liquor licenses and for marijuana licenses. If you are okay with having an abortion clinic in your community, vote it “wet.” If not, vote it “dry.” If you don’t like the fact that your community is “wet,” move.I’m philosophically opposed to abortion, but I’m not willing to pass a law banning it for two reasons. First and foremost, I wouldn’t have been above encouraging my impregnated girlfriend to get one. I also wouldn’t be above taking my kid to the abortion doctor if she was involved in an accident, with, say, Juwan from the basketball team. Likewise, if I was going to end up with a defective kid.Second, the right people are aborting.

        As I always like to point out, abortion existed in times even before the Roman Empire. It was a hotly debated topic in those days. If being against abortion was so important to Christians, why didn’t Jesus spell it out in the New Testament in black and white so that skeptics like me would believe?Jesus should have known that there were plenty of skeptics. He was nailed to the cross because of that skepticism. Why didn’t he spell it out for skeptics like me?Jesus had every opportunity to say something about this subject in the New Testament. He must not have cared enough about this subject very much or he would have said something, don’t you think? If he didn’t care about it, why should I?

                The point is that the all-knowing, infallible Jesus should have known that there were plenty of people like me. And perhaps he did. If he knew there were plenty of people like me, Why didn’t he say something about it? Why wasn’t it enshrined in biblical law?
Logical conclusion: He didn’t give an excrement.
If he didn’t care, why should i?

                        Ummm, no. I don’t want to hear any of you fanatics’ biased interpretations. I want to see it in black and white. “THOU SHALT NOT ABORT.”You can’t sidestep this omission and you know it. Jesus didn’t care enough to spell it out. That means he shrugged his shoulders like most normal people do and said, “Oh, well.”It might not be the most desirable behavior, but it’s legal and for the most part it always has been legal. You’re not required to do it just like you’re not also not required to engage in other legal behaviors such as gambling, prostitution, smoking, drinking, legal drug use, etc.But it is patently offensive that you’re trying to impose your sensibilities on others trying to conjure up some fake biblical justification when there is none. Never mind that we aren’t a theocracy. Or would you like to go down the road of clitoral circumcisions?

                            “Why didn’t he say something about it?”Well, first, we don’t know. “And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.”John 21:25Second, it is impossible to mention all obvious sins in a text like the gospels, especially, when you don’t have a printing press and have to copy each book by hand. People try to write the most important things.Jesus did not spoke against incest, for example, or eating your own sh*t. Obvious things do not need to be written.

                    “…existed in times even before the Roman Empire. It was a hotly debated topic in those days.”Again with those gratuitous assertions.  Citations?  None? I thought so.  Most all your arguments use evidence you pulled from your ass 5 minutes before typing your comment.As for Roman times, perhaps abortion was most likely *not* a discussion because infanticide was an accepted and legally practiced.”In Roman times, the practice where a father could accept or reject the birth of an infant in his household was known as “patria potestas” (Latin for “power of the father”). Under patria potestas, the father (or paterfamilias) had significant authority over his family, including the power to decide whether a newborn child would be accepted into the household.”If the father said, “the hell with it”, the new born was left abandoned on the side of the road.  Jesus was born and lived in such a time.

                Yeah, that’s always the fanatic’s answer. Again, it was hotly debated then as it is today. Jesus knew that and could easily have clarified it if he chose to. He didn’t. That means you are trying to impose your sensibilities on others by claiming some kind of biblical authority when there isn’t any.

And let’s not forget that this isn’t a theocracy and even if it was, not all Christians agree with the anti-abortion fanatics on this. I certainly don’t.

                                Abortion wasn’t a thing 6,000 years ago so I can overlook it not being addressed. I believe it only came about in the last 2,500 or 3,000 years. But it was around, it was common and it was hotly debated when Jesus lived. Absolutely no excuse for this omission if Jesus really cared about this issue.So are you saying that Jesus was fallible? Did the infallible one make a mistake?What you guys are doing with this issue is the same thing you complain about the federal courts doing. You’re looking for “penumbra’s and emanations” in the Bible to support your dogma because no plain language exists.

                                    Doubtful. Like someone above said, I think the women gatherers knew which mushrooms and plants were abortifacients. They were not morons. They were much more attuned to nature and would have noticed an effect like that.
Are you arguing that the very first thing He said to his new creation, man and woman, “Be fruitful and multiply” meant “Make sure you abort as many kids as possible”?

There’s that gratuitous assertion again.  Citations?  Any literature to support such discussions among, Jews, Greeks, or Romans?
One gratuitous assertion is logically and completely rebutted by another—No, abortion was not discussed and “hotly” debated in ancient times by ancient societies—especially when child mortality rates most like exceeded 50% or more in the most loving families.  Life was short, brutal, and harsh to say the least.

                        When you can explain why Jesus didn’t specifically address this very timely (in his day) hot button political issue, yet still supposedly cared about this issue, I will concede. But you can’t and we both know it. You can’t get around the logic.
Jesus didn’t care. For all we know, he may have also taken my view that the right people were aborting then, too. People weren’t pansies in those days.

                                Ayup. Even if He had said, “Abortion is sinful”, in those words @TN would weasel around that He would have said it in Aramaic, or that sinful doesn’t mean wrong, or “He didn’t explicitly say RU-468!”
For some reason, I thought he was interested in knowledge, not “winning”.
BTW, @TN, I believe some day you will get to meet the soul of every baby whose mom your evil words convinced to commit murder. Good luck with that.

                            It wasn’t that hot button – abortion had been around and practiced for centuries. Also didn’t say much about slavery.
However, the didache – a first century catechism and likely the first, did specifically prohibit abortion.

                    OK. I’m willing to play that game. Infanticide was also widely common in the Classical world, in some areas before the child is named, in others up to the age of 2. It was generally felt to be the mother’s choice if they left the babe out for the wolves based on the needs of the family as a whole. Jesus didn’t formally weigh in, so I assume you are on team infanticide then? All the way to age 2, or maybe just if the kid isn’t hitting all his developmental milestones on schedule? Or are you going to leave it up to “sensibilities” of the average wine mom? I mean, you wouldn’t want to be seen telling her what to do. Maybe we should just leave it open until the kid moves out on his own–that’d be some super old school pater-familias kind of $hit!! Fwiw, I don’t really care about abortion either, but acting like communities have no inherent right to collectively draw the line somewhere is some seriously stupid libertarian type thinking.

                This is always fun to watch people twist themselves into pretzels trying to justify this as something Christianity requires. But to your point, we live in a secular society. We can’t impose religious law on people, especially when the overwhelming majority of people, including Christians, don’t buy it.People just get crazy and irrational over anything involving babies and children. Look at how the Amirault family got railroaded in Massachusetts in the 1980s over what in hindsight were laughable allegations. And then more Salem witch trials over what happened at Penn State.That’s all this abortion stuff is. It’s just another variation of the “save the children” types running amok.
