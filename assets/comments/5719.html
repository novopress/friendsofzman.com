        If the US economy were to implode to such an extent that ordinary working-class people started starving in the streets, people will start to look for scapegoats to blame for their misery. If a charismatic leader were to step in and point to the one, easily identifiable – and problematic – minority and convince enough that “They did it.”, well, it certainly is not going to end well.

        I was called up for jury service recently. What surprised me was that something like 40 people didn’t show up, despite the letter they send you warning in big bold print that you could go to jail if you failed to show. Everybody who DID show up was either white or Hispanic — including two Hispanics who couldn’t speak English and required translators. There were no black people.Granted, I live in a very, very white part of Florida, but it was still amazing that I didn’t see any black people there. Blacks might be rare around these parts, but they’re more common than Hispanics who don’t speak a lick of English. It made me wonder about those 40-odd folks who didn’t show up. It had never occurred to me before, but I wonder if this Kentucky judge has ever bothered to consider that this might be a major reason he keeps getting all-white juries.

        The solution is obvious: we must create safe spaces for People of Color where they will not have to face the daily oppression and micro- and macro-aggressions of the heteronormative, cis-abled, People of Pallor. Rather, they’ll be free to establish their own courts, town councils, police departments, schools, prisons, etc, without the burden of the White Patriarchy holding them down.Cuba might be a good location for this new Rainbow Utopia, though there’s always Liberia. The new program will require a catchy name…something that makes it clear that PoCs will not be forced to mingle with PoPs. Something that will tell them that they are, forever, apart…separate…Not Us…Hmmm, I’m drawing a blank.

        Soon the “majority-minorities” in the USA will be Asian and Hispanic.Neither of these two groups will even pretend to give the black “grievances” one iota of credibility, nor blame whitey for the black social pathologies.Ironically, the democrats are all for open borders through which mostly hispanics flood into the USA, and blacks vote 100% of the time for democrats. Blacks are voting for their own irrelevancy.Also note that wealthy , black elites – like Oprah or Obama- totally IGNORE ( if not detest) inner city blacks and make ZERO substantive efforts to help them. Oprah will fund a school in S. Africa while stating that inner city blacks here in the USA are just concerned with the latest pair of Nikes.The experiences of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Belgium, Sweden demonstrate that differing ethnic groups plunged together by the ruling elites oft times will NOT assimilate and will live near each other but inhabit different socio-economic planets.Here in the USA , Asians have assimilated very successfully and their economic standing is higher than whites, even though they were discriminated against since the mid-1800s. Since Asians never were a poitical “game” for politicians – Asians could not be exploited for purely political reasons – Asians were left “alone” by the politicians and left wing groups.Unfortunately for blacks , they have been anointed by the politicians and lefty elites as a political tool ( to advance the wealth and power of these elites and lefties) , and accordingly are sacrificial lambs – to be discarded when no longer useful. Blacks have bought into the blame whitey game – a convenient excuse for many to explain their social pathologies- and as long as they look to the WHITE ELITES ( and black, MILLIONAIRE poverty pimps) to deliver them into prosperity, they will make precious little economic progress .It really is a shame, because they CAN be successful.

        The robot historians and archaeologists will also examine the evidence of the white, male dominated culture that was the most fearsome and well organized band of warriors ever assembled, that built a society that was second to none in wealth, justice, and opportunity (not perfect, mind you, but second to none), and had the collective capacity and research tools to develop the robot intelligence in the first place. They will try to figure out how it all went off the rails, and the best answer they will find was that there was a differential of outcomes across humanity, and “it was not fair, dammit!”.  So the white, male culture allowed and assisted in its own dismantlement.  Because in a just world, “fairness” apparently trumps all.

        I remember in the news section of the old Natlamp there was a story with the headline (I quote from memory) ” Cub Slugger Jerry Morales Mugged by Elderly Jewish Man”.  The article reported that the assailant, Sidney Greenbaum, would be tried by a jury of his peers, “preferably twelve elderly Jews who have been frequently mugged.”

        It is an interesting thought that the (black) judge in this piece fundamentally mistrusts (white) people and their views, no matter how much he has been elevated by a system dreamed up by (white) people. No doubt he would, therefore, be horrified that (white) people might not in turn trust (black) judges because any (racist/race-orientated) views by the bench are, er, prejudicial.
He would of course claim that the colour of his skin is immaterial in overseeing justice, but equally insist that the colour of the jury is not immaterial. How odd, some might say.
