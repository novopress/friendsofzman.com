        What I really love is how so many self-taught constitutional scholars suddenly appear to declare that what StopRush does is somehow illegal or immoral. When did it become a crime to ask a company to divest from misogyny and bigotry? After all, it was fine with right wing nutjobs when it happened to Howard Stern. It was happening to MSNBC with #OpSlam right before Limbaugh went off on his “slut” rant.But for some reason, Rush is a special person who gets special protection from the law…despite the fact that neither you, nor Rush’s favorite legal professor, nor Brian Glicklich can cite any actual laws to back this assertion.About those names you’ve reposted: they are already getting threats, and if history is any guide they will now be subject to identity theft, real-life stalking, and smears. That’s what happened to the first cohort of volunteers on Twitter, which is why these volunteers were operating under pseudonyms. But I’m sure that liberals are just fair game…because of some imaginary law that none of you can cite.Just to give you one example ofhow incorrect Glicklich is, we have volunteers in radio markets around the country listening to his show so that we can identify and contact his sponsors — but these volunteers are not accounted in his math, are they?Our volunteers currently have a database of nearly four thousand companies that have divested from Limbaugh’s hate-radio show. We have been so successful that we now have to focus on his PSAs because there are no paid ads left. This took thousands of people, and not one of us has ever seen a Media Matters personality in the Flush Rush Facebook group. Not ever.So you can continue to believe what you want, but the laws say otherwise, and so do the volunteers of a movement that is succeeding in its mission. This is why his fans’ hatred for us is so vile and disinhibited: we are effective, and it causes them tremendous butthurt.They are such wonderful people.

        Perhaps a policy of IMMEDIATE confiscation of institutional “.edu” status, upon abandonment of actual“.edu” function may be a start.This includes union janitors, Blah blah blah emeritus, and “administrators” as well of course.Let them stand on what “the public’ believes  their BA, MA, or PhD, “credentials” are worth.

        It must be nice to be a fascist and seemingly get away with it. I hate to go all ad hominum but I’d bet donuts and dollars the women in this cabal are a bunch of pinch faced shrews who couldn’t get the dog to kiss them with a pork chop tied around their neck. Seig Heil feminazis!

        Whether a lawsuit against a boycott or promotion of a boycott would be successful, probably depends a great deal on whether some laws were broken in the process.There have been some court cases, mainly involving Israeli boycotts. Including one in Washington state, where a Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit against the Olympia Food Co-Op, saying its decision to boycott products from Israel was protected free speech.SodaStream won a case in France against Association France Palestine Solidarite (AFPS). “The court concluded that a boycott, even if instituted for political or moral considerations, must be “fair” and not abusive, a condition that AFPS violated by defacing a SodaStream advertisement and covering it with an image of blood as part of its smear campaign.”
