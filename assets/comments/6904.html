        I never did understand the court ruling wherein the stolen videos made by Pamala Anderson’s celebrity husband of the couple having sex were not ruled private property and quashed from publication by those receiving them from the thief.

        “Now, it’s probably better that Gawker will be shuttered and the owner ruined. ”This caught my attention.  Any well run business should keep cash on hand or some asset they could sell set aside as a provision for losing an expensive lawsuit.  Litigation risk is something analysts take into account when evaluating a business.  But Gawker Media may not be a well run business.  I can’t think of an instance where a media coverage was shuttered by a lawsuit.  Usually, when they fail its due to declining revenue.Anyway this prompted me to go to their site.  I’ve sometimes gone to gawker.com and found some of the posts funny, but its never been on my lists of sites that disappeared.  I then went to the wikipedia page about Gawker and learned that they run a ton of websites that I’ve never heard of, and overall seem to be a fairly sleazy company and Denton a fairly sleazy person.  So yeah it might be better if they went away.

            It has been standard for media companies to carry defamation insurance for these cases. Typically, the policy is tied to the size of the company. That’s the thing to remember with insurance, it’s about potential loss. It’s why you cannot get a billion dollar policy on your Toyota Corolla.  Gawker is probably valued at $10 million based on their revenues.What’s going to ruin them is no one will lend to them as they have this enormous liability hanging over them. In order to appeal, they need to post a bond and that means at least $5 million of cash or assets must be pledged as collateral. Maybe George Soros will post the collateral, but no bank will do it. That’s why I suspect their lawyers will explore a settlement. Hogan knows he will never see that money. He’ll accept an apology, acknowledgement of wrongdoing, legal fees and cash. But, he could force the issue and bankrupt the company.

                I agree. Hogan will take 5-10 million. His big decision will be whether or not to sign a confidentiality agreement.

                Gawker’s net revenue for 2014 was 250 million. Every part of this company is vile, all the way down to their lowest paid blogger. It’s a total fever swamp over there.

            In Gawker’s original story, they described his member as having the length and girth of a child’s lunchbox thermos holding an apple. Me thinks he’s light years away from micro.

        I do not subscribe to gawker, and nor do I know what their ethos is though the name “Gawker’ suggests it is from an old word ‘Gawk’ meaning to stare stupidly.I take it in an age where people stare stupidly as a matter of routine, the site’s founders think this makes for entertainment. They may be right. Again, I don’t know but as I don’t want to be accused of gawking I shan’t go there to see.However, I did see a story that suggests the Gawker people will appeal on the basis, perhaps, of having evidence not in the original case. If so, this is disturbing: I would have thought for the law to work all relevant evidence has to be made available once and for all. That makes me wonder how (and I am no lawyer, as is patently obvious) evidence can be withheld from the original trial but be available for appeal. Hmmm….

            There are rules as to what constitutes evidence. In order to keep be fair to both sides, the judge decides if the testimony and evidence offered to the jury is relevant to the case and if it would be useful in their deliberations. On appeal, Gawker will ask a judge to review the trial judges determinations. The appeals court may rule that key evidence was improperly excluded. The judge could also rule that the jury was correct, but levied an excessive award. This is much more likely.The challenge for Gawker is they have to post a bond now in order to appeal. The reason for this is to avoid delaying things indefinitely with endless appeals. In this case it means $50 million. They will need to arrange for that and there’s no reason to think they can do it. Plus, they now have a huge incentive to settle.

        All of that was a problem in the case.  Gawker never said where they got it, but it seems clear the homeowner (and husband of the woman in the tape) recorded it and sold it to them. Did he have title to the tape? Did Gawker claim they were shielding their source?  Did Bollea have an expectation of privacy in someone else’s home?
I’m not smart enough to referee all that, but I am smart enough to hope that the careers of Denton and every Gawker “journalist” are destroyed .

            The law is pretty clear. Secretly taping someone having sex is going to require a release from the performers. If Gawker could have provided evidence that Hogan knew he was being taped, then they would have won. The funny thing here is Hogan’s celebrity helps. He makes a living from his image so court will tend to side with him when it comes to who owns his image.
