        Outstanding as usual, Z. I admit Soros is not somebody I would ordinarily take pains to listen to or understand. He sounds much like the denizens of the shitlib hive I grew up in and eventually rejected. You put my objections to all that into coherent verbiage. The bigger question is – how do we use it? The people arrayed against us will say “diversity is our strength” and it’s end of story, full stop. If you try to have a rational conversation with them you get ostracized or dismissed. On the other hand…I see that antisemitism is showing signs of going mainstream because a lot of normies are watching the wheels come off…and they start asking who is doing this and why? Maybe it’s all timing? Maybe people are starting to ask that question and are ready to hear the answer?As always: liked, subscribed, upvoted, and for the record- the commentary here is often just as good as the article. I hope you and the Dissidents are having a great weekend.

        The observation about the (White) wealthy doing good works for (White) society in past times (even if it stroked their ego) as well as (White) society’s concrete recognition of those works and its (White) heroes and champions (military or other) struck a nerve.  When thinking about where we are today, and frankly the past 60 odd years, who the hell would we honor with statues or buildings or parks or mountains or cities or streets?  Oh, that’s right, a career nigro criminal who OD’d while in a White cop’s custody.  As things stand currently, degradation, deracination and corruption rule the day.  Monuments to past (White) heroes and achievement are torn down while degenerates, perverts and other associated POC dross are celebrated.  The open, all encompassing, all forgiving society is a disaster.

            A few of the ex-Soviet states celebrated the end of their occupation by tearing down statues of Lenin and Stalin and replacing them with Lou Reed and Frank Zappa, who’d been symbols of resistance/liberty for the bohemian boomers who inherited those countries’ leadership. It seemed ludicrous at the time, and it’s become more so ever since—but then look at us. Prince (the musician) is the only admirable person who’s been given an official statue since…fifty years ago? The MLK statue is just some Chinese guy.

                I would erect a statue to Public Enemy–seriously. Assuming the Country Once Known as the United States even exists in five or so years–big assumption, no other musical group presaged present day Banana Empire better. Shithole of a joke and police state boxes–all checked!
Totally prescient.

                    Public Enemy did indeed warn us about theFear of a Black Planet.
Ice-T also explained the globalist plan in, “There Goes the Neighborhood,” but most read that cut in a tongue and cheek way.

            I’ve also noticed our new elites not only lack decorum, but seemingly any self-awareness regarding decorum.  I recently became aware of Marc Benioff’s “Benioff Children’s Hospital” in San Francisco.
A blue blood “robber baron” of a century ago would never have been so gauche to put his name on an institution. Their reputation for social inelegance preceded their rise, and obviously for good reason.

                “our new elites”Bobby Jr went THERE.https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4168093/posts“I have never, ever suggested that the COVID-19 virus was targeted to spare Jews. I accurately pointed out — during an off-the-record conversation — that the U.S. and other governments are developing ethnically targeted bioweapons and that a 2021 study of the COVID-19 virus shows that COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect certain races since the furin cleave docking site is most compatible with Blacks and Caucasians and least compatible with ethnic Chinese, Finns, and Ashkenazi Jews. In that sense, it serves as a kind of proof of concept for ethnically targeted bioweapons. I do not believe and never implied that the ethnic effect was deliberately engineered. That study is here:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32664879/”I don’t know how much longer “our new elites” will allow Bobby Jr to continue breathing oxygen, but enjoy his presence while you still can.

        Went looking for Zman’s most recent interview wit El Niño Speaks and accidentally stumbled on one he did with the guy last year, just in case anyone wants it:https://josbcf.substack.com/p/el-nino-speaks-33-what-does-the-future#details
I’ll probably listen to it, since Z’s hours are one of the few podcasts I bother with. The kids like Fuentes with their five hours of talk bracketed by vapor wave and hip-hop music just does not do it for me.

        As pessimistic as I can be I do see signs lefty can’t keep all these plates spinning. I also suspect a lot of normies/lefties are beginning to get nervous as well. I think that’s one reason we’ve seen mass migration throughout the States, people escaping diversity under the guise of taxes or “more freedom” or some shit. The future is likely to be soft separation and regionalism. And if we could only get whites to actually reproduce it could look pretty bright indeed.

            There’s still a few men out there like Z and I who haven’t fled, holding down the rearguard action 🙂
But yes. I agree with the comment and I would have fled too if not for certain specific (positive) things keeping me in one place.

That is the present. I’m as blackpilled as the next but it is blatantly obvious where this is going, hopefully peacefully but the Woke religious fanatics run the show in their shitholes.

                Agree.
In our west suburban Chicago community, we certainly see soft separation.
We’ve friends who are to the right, but certainly not based, that have openly said they moved to a different neighborhood because their old one was too full of Indians.
We practically have a subculture within our Catholic school &amp; parish community, separate from the rest.
People are self-segregating.  I like it.  Hopefully the next step will be open free-association and accompanying discrimination.

        For a long time, many members of the elite professional/managerial class lived as though it was the 1950s. They met their spouse young, bought a house in the suburbs (or an expensive part of a city), and raised the family together. Divorce was relatively rare for this cohort and they demanded good schools and high standards from the services they consumed. In a lot of ways they lived in a sort of closed society, walled off from the insanity that your supported policies created. Other people paid the price for them and you got to feel good about it. imposing it on them. This arguably reached its zenith in Obama’s second term – “the great awokening”, as it’s been termed. Since then, though, they drank their own kool-aid, and showed an increased willingness to let this stuff into their own lives and their own communities. How else could you describe parents taking their children to a drag show? A few years ago, parents in Park Slope, Brooklyn willingly destroyed one of the best public middle schools in NYC at the altar of diversity, bringing chaos and violence to their own children.I wonder what will happen next. The chaos is hitting their own lives and you can only keep your head in the sand so long. I wonder if some of these people are now secret Trump supporters. Maybe this is why we are seeing full-on totalitarianism from the government now – this is the natural end result of any multicultural society, as you cannot hold together a society full of people who hold different values through any means other than force.

EXACTLY RIGHT.
It has never worked, will never work and can’t be made to work.  The experiment has failed and it has failed hard.

                Z: “It turns out that diversity is the bane of human organization because it multiplies the number of people who must be coerced in order to maintain the illusion of consensus.”The existential meta-traitor, Robert Putnam, was seeing all of this in his research on die-versititty, but sat on the data, and refused to publicize it, for something like a decade or more.Meanwhile, in his private life, Putnam walked away from Christianity [if you can even consider wesleyanism to be “Christianity” in the first place], joined his wife’s synagogue and formally became a j00.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._PutnamThere’s a special place in he11 for monsters like Robert D Putnam.

            “Maybe this is why we are seeing full-on totalitarianism from the government now – this is the natural end result of any multicultural society, as you cannot hold together a society full of people who hold different values through any means other than force.”There are several factors, but this looms large. The interesting aspect is that the more totalitarian the United States becomes, the less it seeks to keep it hidden. All totalitarian societies prior to this one had a great deal of buy-in or eventual buy-in, though. Bloomberg was roasted when he noted that the CCP required popular support, but for all the wrong reasons he was correct. We saw this play out after the Chinese revolted over the Covid restrictions and they were lifted. The psychopaths in D.C., religiously fanatical Puritans that they are, think they can hold onto power through raw, brutal force without much popular support. Good luck with that one. Those “migrants” floating across the Rio Grande aren’t going to cut it.The world has moved past the United States in many ways, and it will not be long until the people within its borders do the same. Arguably that is happening now as the sorting and splintering accelerates. The folks inside the Imperial Capitol seem blissfully unaware of all of it.

            I’ve wondered if the great awokening is some kind of response to their failed project. As their End of History diverse utopia fails and gets less and less viable, they cling harder to their delusions, and lash out at the “wreckers”.Namely, the Bitter Clingers/Deplorable who caused Obama to fail and refused to give up their racism. And these Deplorables, stopped the inevitable progress of history by voting in a Bad Orange Man.So expect the wokeness to ramp up. Trudeau was lecturing Muslims opposed to LGBT brainwashing today – he said that they were being “misled” by the “American far right”. Expect increasingly delusional actions by the regime and increasing hostility towards the Bitter Clingers, who are the cause for their failures.Don’t forget, Mao never said “hey, these millions are starving, maybe I should reevaluate communism”. The utopia was always just around the corner, until his movement burned out. Except the same in the West.

            Parents, or just the moms? Usually, when someone reports on drag shows at public libraries, we get images of the draggies about 95 per cent of the time. I’d like to see our citizen journalists post photographs of those in the audience whenever possible. I’d like to see just who takes their kids to these events. I suppose that there’s the occasional sperm donors who follow their wives and little Aidan or Skylar to the George Floyd branch, but I’d bet a few piasters that they are mostly single chablis moms. The draggies have been around for some time but they’ve been tolerated as long as they existed on the fringes. I find myself befuddled by the sudden “demand” (or is it “supply?”) for this freak show–if you can keep score of them. This is but one chapter in the saga of the assisted Arkancide of the U.S.–and the West.

                    Summer camps for trannies? That sounds like a great opportunity for introducing them to, and getting them familiar with long guns. I got to shoot a single shot 22 at a target range at my summer camp; but probably at Trannie Camp they would learn to handle an AR so they could emulate the Nashville church school murderer. Whaddya think?

            A Theocratic prison system. Perfect description of the product of Soros’ vision.
So, either he is an intellectual failure, or this was the intended result. I doubt Alex Soros will back off and admit he is wrong as the coercion gets worse and worse. I doubt it because all of he and his fellow traveller’s have financial and controlling interest incentives to keep the project moving toward the completion of the prison it is building.

            This is what 20 plus years of nonstop brainwashing and propaganda has done!  That is not a normal reaction. Nobody who hasn’t been brainwashed and primed to react like this would react this way, even if they didn’t agree. An English speaking foreigner would not react this way.
This is what we are up against.

                His knee jerk desire to call other whites racist and out the bigot is totally insane and programmed.  He gleefully wants then to be racist so he can be a hero and have power over them.To call a white a racist in this society is the same as calling them subhuman.  It invites the racist reaction is purports to abhor.It’s an old trick: say I’m a civnat colorblind grilled who mildly suggests that the border be controlled for the welfare of all.  Screeching loons swoop in and castigate my evil racist motives and character.  If I weren’t a racist before, then i become one soon.

                Even worse look at the comment section.  Either an overwhelming majority of people are equally brainwashed in the leftist religion with their “omg you hero” comments, or nearly everyone who disagrees is afraid to say anything against the comment mob’s two minutes of hate.
Imagine a moderate comes in there and says something like “Well that woman was a bit rude but the driver didn’t need to react like that.”  He’d get flayed by all the bien pensants.

            Waiting for him to show up on VDare’s whites killed by blacks in a few months or a year.
“I’m calling the cops. I’m calling the cops.” Why? Because someone was happy to see someone who looked like them and could speak English properly. Happy to see on of their kinfolk and he is offended.
If he doesn’t end up on VDare’s List, then keep his photo so when he comes to our gates, we tell him a proper and justified “f*** off”, call our cops and escort him to our border.

            To all the people commenting on the video Fakeemail posted, consider this.
The guy is a Lyft driver. There may not be a more foolish occupation on the planet. He’s really not to be taken seriously.
And I agree with the notion that this guy is gonna end up ventilated by some diverse creature. With people like that, with such a lack of self awareness and awareness of their surroundings, it’s simply a matter of time.

            So I’m going to post something in agreement with y’all on this, with a caveat.There was nothing wrong with the woman saying something about the guy being white and speaking English. If this white guy moved to an African country and drove a Lyft in a big city, would he be offended by  black passengers if they remarked that he was white? “Hello my friend, I do not meet many white Americans here in Somalia, what brings you to our country?” Would he post videos about it on YouTube to shame the Somalis?I’ll be the first to say that we OUGHT to be able to live freely in our own country, the country our ancestors conquered and built, and if we have immigrants or visitors working here on visas, we ought to be able to remark on that fact without being called bigots.Having said that, sometimes people say things in a way that is ill advised. The world we actually live in and the world we ought to be living in are two different things. She probably shouldn’t have assumed “hey this guy is one of us and I can let my guard down.” It’s unfortunate, but it’s true. But worse than what she said, which was still nothing, the guy who was with her shouldn’t have called him a n**gr lover. He should have defended her right to make a comment and used some logic to counter the driver, instead of jumping into name calling and language that plays into the accusation.I know I’m going to get “dislike” thumbs down on this comment, but I don’t think language like that is helpful. In my personal life, as much as I despise the forced diversity we are all subjected to, I find that I’m happier when I try to just be kind to people, even if I really hate them. Walking around with a chip on my shoulder, looking for conflict is not in my own interest.But I’d say the same about the Lyft driver. He is an asshole who is looking for conflict, and creating unnecessary conflict when there should be none.

                For sure, the man should have left it at that after calling the guy as asshole.
But calling him racist is an entrapment.  It’s meant to enrage, scare, and rattle the person to do or say things which aren’t necessarily where the person is coming from.
The hurl “racist” is like throwing a punch.  A lot of people will be thrown off and punch bag in a way that they fall into the trap.

        I’d like to know how we are supposed to challenge the idea of the “open society” when SJWs are propagandizing the people to react to such ideas with anger, violence, disgust, confusion etc.We have the most thorough, powerful, all encompassing system of brainwashing ever devised.  Everywhere a person turns to is brainwashing propaganda. It starts at a very young age and never ends.  It’s been going on a long time.The only real advantage we have is that the “open society” business requires that constant brainwashing and propaganda whereas we have the “null” position.  But it’s been nonstop brainwashing and propaganda for at least 75 years.

            Honestly, there is no challenging it.  In fact, it won’t be defeated.  It will get worse and worse until it cannot be sustained.  The entire ideology is built on ideals that directly conflict with reality.  It can only be propped up for so long.  None of us will live to see it fail.  It may take another 100 years, who knows.  The only certainty is that it will get worse and worse.  America is dead, she is not being revived, she is not coming back.  Leftism has destroyed her and continues to beat the corpse with a bat.Take solace in the fact that eventually, those who championed all of this will meet a terrible demise.  Someday…

            “how we are supposed to challenge the idea of the “open society” when SJWs are propagandizing the people?”Your question shows why I say that until the people who run the media are neutralized, we’re mostly helpless.  Most people, even people with high IQs, cannot think independently.  Their morality is programmed into them by the mass media.There are a few posts on this thread that blame white people most for our predicament.  This is Derb’s analysis as well.But I say that most people, including most whites, literally cannot think for themselves.  It’s not their fault.  It’s just the way they were made.  So, the blame goes to the ones who are programming them.

        I was going to do a rant on how framing goblin political goals as them being on a moral crusade is fallacious since they’re clearly operating on self-interest to secure a monopoly on ethnocentrism while denying it to the only other groups with IQs capable of threatening their power.The more I thought about it, it IS a moral crusade in their twisted little goblin minds.  Right vs wrong is fundamentally defined as “good for the goblin” vs “bad for the goblin”.  So when a goblin starts preaching about the open society, from his frame of reference he isn’t just cynically kibitzing for his people’s benefit.  His people’s benefit is the greatest good, after all.This cultural misalignment is why men and goblins can never coexist.  The only solution outside of mass butchering would be to make the goblins into men, or the men into goblins.  Evidently we acceded to the latter as goblin morality dominates.

It is time to look ourselves in the mirror get our confidence back and ask, “What do I want for me, my family and my fellow European folk?”We want our traditional and diasporic homelands.We want full sovereignty over them.We want to resume pursuit of our destiny as a folk and as nations that was halted after we walked on the moon.Who is going to give that to me? Nobody! So what must I and my folk do to attain that?We know the answers. What are we willing to do to attain it?It is time to forge our will and impose it on the world in just pursuit of our homelands, our sovereignty and our destiny.We gave them their homeland. Let them make of it what they will and look on what they build with satisfaction knowing from here on it, they did it without our help.

Lots of meat in these podcasts that are filled with interesting connections across history . You have a talent to organize and prioritize subjects that serve whatever the theme is . Todays podcast on diversity was very cleverly done . I do enjoy your humorous reading of zirl science or other news , but a show on the news for me now is hard to takeI am learning deficient in politics , never could enjoy it but you ,Zman , have shown me the context and history of todays headlines and I am very grateful for all you have done and all the work that you put into the blog .

            There are varying degrees of closedness. Society writ large is comprised of many individual tribes, peoples, interests. Each one of those has its own mores and mysteries. While there may be a lot of movement on a national basis, there is much that gets experienced and underreported at the grassroots level. There is truth in the saying All politics is local.

        “Who are we?” The chicken and the egg issue.“Who we are” is “Who we’ve been.” Every biological entity evolves uniqueness based upon what “works” in its local environment. Hence, all distinguishing differences in traits and behaviors are derived from environmentally driven necessity that evolved over many generations. It’s not what you choose, but what you inherit that determines who you are. And there is nothing volitional about this reality. An 18th Century Englishman arriving in the Congo is not going to thrive in that environment no matter “how much he believes in his righteous superiority.”And this is why the majority of blacks remain dysfunctional trying to live on the North American Continent rather than Sub Saharan Africa. Biology trumps ideology. Yes, there can be exceptions on the individual level, but in the main, you have the equivalent of an infection that cannot heal. Ditto for all invasive species that transplant from a different place.For about a billion years, nature sorted out these anomalies using fitness selection, but then civilization happened and man-made intervention screwed the pooch. We are now on course for a hardcore tyranny that attempts to homogenize all Homo sapiens into insect-like drones that can readily adapt almost anywhere (sort of like cockroaches). Is that the future you desire?

        Below, Nick Fuentes comes up.I disagree with the Zman’s ire, here’s why.Nikki the Racist Clown is doing vaudeville, because vaudeville works.He doesn’t remember Walter Cronkite and Chet Brinkley’s “firm but fair, Father Knows Best” routine.  MLK put on a suit and a tie, and look where that got us.Nick tried the public /Our/ Thing route- an informal militia!- and he got the treatment meted out to Murray, Watson, the Oathkeepers, the Jan 6 crowd.  They stole $500,000 from the kid and his only success was to get Sebastian Gorka canceled.What’s a young guy born in Clown World to do?  Gravitas?  Hit the books? Run for office? Short the pound sterling and the Thai baht?He’s not that obnoxious Handsome Truth fed or that ridiculous Alex S. pipsqueak- these bozos are getting people arrested all over Florida with their stunts.  He’s not furtively pasting posters to phone polls.  None of such reeks of class or appeals to status.What made John Stewart the most popular show?  What worked for the Melting Pot playwright?Vaudeville.  They gentled it in to a broad audience.  Their ideas weren’t shaking their fist, the medicine went down easy.Nicki flatly stated, “well, black people are dumber than whites,” (paraphrased), and no eeking and ooking ensued.  Everybody nodded in agreement, as if he’d said, “blacks run fast,” another honest statement.  He was able to follow up with the idea that  whites can be white, and it’s no violation of God’s law.He’s doing what he can, according to the rules of the society he was born to.Plus, he’s got to work the seminar circuit to get some of that money back, and to stay in operation.  I’m hoping he will move to Trump or Billy Graham-style rallies, like an Alvvays or Tay Sway concert.We aren’t going to get a White ethnostate anytime soon, facetime is a heck of a lot better than paving driveways, patching barn roofs, or pickpocketing tourists from our shappy caravans like Gypsy Travellers.I’m sorry for your disappointment, Zman, but we can’t unmix this bag.We’re in unknown waters here.

        I collect artifacts, publications and histories of America’s now nearly extinct Military School / Academy movement.  Not the service academies, (which have been wholly captured and subdued by the consensus) but the tremendous system that built up beginning mid to late 19th century for the education and character development of men, before being nearly eradicated beginning in the late ’60s.  Why is this germane to a discussion of this Open Society?I give you two quotes from the 1941 Culver Military Academy Woodcraft Camp publication (summer camp for boys 9-19):“All boys must be physically able to participate in the active outdoor life and also be free from any disabilities.  Boys afflicted with asthma or enuresis are not accepted.“Excellent character and good citizenship are required of all boys.  The names of three character witnesses are requested on the application.  These should be teachers, boy leaders, or alumni and patrons of Culver who have an intimate knowledge of the applicant.  Culver writes for the character recommendations.”They were serious about this.And:“While Culver provides the most modern educational facilities to contribute to the boy’s learning, enjoyment and well being, he is surrounded by the unconscious influences of beauty, orderliness and good taste that are conducive to clean thought and upright living.”Imagine this worldview and its directives still animating any institution in this nation.  Culver is one of the few military academies to have survived the cultural onslaught of the late 60s / early 70s.  The Woodcraft program still exists (since 1912), and at least outwardly has the same form — except that females can participate now (which surely has radically altered the experience for boys).And thought most of these fine institutions have failed, been coopted and turned into woke schools for the upper crust, or simply taken out (as was St Johns in Kansas recently … a survivor put under by allegations — or the fact of — of homosexual abuse) by the screeching horde, Culver still holds their military academy as male only.  They dodged the bullet by starting the non-military Culver Girls Academy.Anyway …. these schools always established a proper moral outlook, and emphasized character building and immersion into a common culture, whether established by some religious entity, or as many were, by individuals or family dynasties.  Reading their publications gives a clear glimpse into an America, and a culture, now obliterated.

        Meh. Sorry, but I don’t buy this notion of the so-called “open society” one bit. America/AINO has always been a closed society. Prior to the rise of the New Left, negroes, pervs, and to a lesser extent, Hispanics and Orientals, were excluded from society’s rich heart. With the rise of the New Left, however, the poles were reversed. The formerly marginalized have been placed in the center, while the white majority is now en route to second-class citizenship and marginalization. Whites are tolerated only to the extent we keep the electricity and water running, and the planes from crashing. But only a blind fool could fail to see that our culture has been denigrated and demolished, our history transmogrified and trashed, and our civilizational structures undermined and destabilized. And this, moi drugi, is no accident.

            Yep. There is no “open society,” there is your society and there is my society, and whichever one we live in depends on who has the power to enforce his morals on the other.The idea of the “open society” was a leftist Trojan horse that they used against traditional America when they were the outgroup. Now that they’re in power, they slammed the door shut on us. (((Marcuse))) advocated this directly with his essay on “repressive tolerance.”The biggest problem we on the DR face, though, is the Normie Grillercon who still thinks that we live in an “open society” and we need to be “fair” to the negroes, immigrants, and queers who have demonstrated that they are only going to use that “fairness” as an opening to stick a knife in your ribs.

                No, the Normie can’t be a roadblock or a problem, nor objective.At best a resource.They are only in it for themselves, to get anything from them would require compulsion.What you call normie is indeed normal and immutable, and eternal.That is most men for all of history, it’s always only been the fighters and the leaders that count.  You’re still talking democracy, as if they matter in struggle.They don’t.  They are potatoes only concerned with their own plot.With rare exceptions, useless in a test. They will always back the strong horse, but their “backing” is head nodding.  Not fight.The rare exceptions are warrior societies, and the original democracies where only the soldiers voted – in Athens you were not a full citizen until you completed military training, Rome essentially the same.This was the American system more or less until the 19th Amendment.  The Anglo Fyrd, the militia, every able bodied man.These Citizens think Grilling is the peak of masculinity.Forget Normie.Forget Majority rule.The bravest thing most Americans have ever done in my lifetime is chant “Fuck Joe Biden” and they peaked with FJB.This is eternal to man.

        On topic-I was laid off this week. Why?My company has been barreling headfirst with no brakes into rapidly increasing purity spirals and DEI worship. One of the main things that drew me to them was when I interviewed initially I was interviewed by 6 white men in total, two of which were wizened gray haired oldsters. This stuck out like a sore thumb, in a good way, since I’d been through dozens of interviews with other companies that had the typical United Colors of Benneton setup of diversity hires, wahmen, and people who clearly had make-work BS roles foisted on them.But sadly, though perhaps not unsurprisingly, we started drinking the kool-aid by the gallon last year and this year it was FAR worse. EVERY week I’m getting DEI this, diversity that, Pride BS, internal resources available to women, minorities, everyone but the white guys that hired me are being celebrated.They also have been promoting to upper management in a way that almost insures they will be driving the train off the cliff. In the past 18 months I’ve seen two stronk Latinas both in their early 30s rocketed up to Executive Director positions. They were f-ckingAccount Managersand moved 3 levels up the org chart in one fell swoop. Qualifications? Tits and brown skin. Literally. Passed right on by several white guys that had over a decade (or more) in their respective fields.So long story short, the DEI contagion has fully metastasized now and is consuming everything. I’m no fan of Vox Day but his theories on convergence and how it happens in the “slowly, then suddenly” motif are 100% on point.My boss’s boss, one of the “stronk Latinas” had me on a quick meeting with HR, also a stronk latina. So this women who was a junior account manager now an “Executive Director” gave me a speech about cost-cutting, blah blah. I just translated in my mind- ‘You are an unbending and unbreaking obviously alpha white male, you are a threat, you gotta go’. That is what I was hearing over the din of corporate BS they were spouting. They want compliant, soft, sheepish beta white males who will quietly accept their servitude to negros, latinas, wahmen, and fags. I ain’t that guy. Never will be.  I didn’t broadcast it, but I do give off a certain “don’t f-ck w/ me” vibe passively so I can’t say this was totally surprising.It is unfortunate not just because I’m newly unemployed but because this company was one of the last holdouts. An IT company founded by a family dynasty of Republicans who never went public and so managed to keep the place looking like somewhere from the late 90s. But as is often the case, the father pass the reigns to the son who is far younger and has been ‘properly programmed’ by The Machine so he’s setting about destroying his father’s legacy. Sad, many such cases…

            Sorry to hear that AP. Sounds like it is time to set up an Apex Consulting company. Too bad Z or other dissidents don’t have some community building resources so such things could take flight. Drag some of their best customers and get the job done better.There is no shade for the white man except what he can build in the company of his people.Here is an interview with a South African talking about how he and his folk are building trenches.

                You are a stalwart, Apex, bless you and keep you on the road ahead.I’m going homeless, because I can, and to deal with debt and everything on the plate, so I’m giving the Cali house to an older brother; he finally got a very decent gig.  Doing exams for retired vets.Turns out everybody in the VA medical clinic is black.  He knows more than everyone there.We’ll see. But, his clients are 98% old white guys.  He’s a Christian; I told him God put him right where he needs him.His is the only white face these guys see, at their greatest vulnerability.No one said the road was easy, but it is the road we have chosen.Gods, I hope you were somewhat ready for this.  Nobody can ever be ready enough.

            I am very sorry to hear about your situation.If you don’t mind me asking, what were the company’s financials actually like? When I first started reading your post, I thought you were about to tell us that the company had bankrupted itself with an abundance of diversity hires in a classic case of “get woke, go broke.” But towards the end of your post, it sounded to me like you thought they had gotten rid of you because they didn’t like your type.Is the company really “cost-cutting” and how well are they doing financially? Also, if the company is private, what do they need “executive directors” for?If you really feel like you were fired due to your race, sex, or religion, you have a clear path to file an EEO claim. Don’t delay doing this, because there are time limits involved and you will want to file while it’s still fresh in your mind and before the evidence disappears.

As blackpilling as things are, there’s still plenty of plunder, and you can choose whether to follow the hyper-competency path or taking their dumb rules to their advantage. My buddy is quarter-hispanic, but refused to milk it for all it was worth. While I respect that, fair play against morons who hate you is a losing strategy.

            Apex:  Very sorry to hear you’ve been laid off – particularly after all you went through trying to find a job after your prior run-in with diversity and ‘our’ legal system.  Especially when you were smart and thoughtful in your targeting – a family-owned company still in private hands with lots of Whites in upper management.My husband is blessed to be employed by the same, but . . . the owner has no children and really has no plan (that my husband knows of) for the company when he dies.  He apparently has his bunker set up in a neighboring state and doesn’t seem to spend as much time (or money) with his pet charity.  If we can hang on for a few more years to ensure our sons are well set up and provided  for, we’ll be okay.But I know you mentioned being recently married and looking to move out of AINO.  I pray that something better comes your way asap.

                Yeah, I had to claw my way outta the pit after my last run in with “diversity” which cost me 7 of my primary earning years. I was able to turn that state sponsored tragedy into a pretty nice redemption story but then here we are again!This time, nowhere near as traumatic and far reaching and I cannot say diversity -alone- was the cause, my department really was upside down financially but cutting the most credentialed, most technically adept, competent, and well-liked resource is how things are done today, especially if White Male.I’m very tight w/ former teammates because I don’t just talk sh-t here, I am what I claim. I’m a charismatic natural leader of men (and wahmen) so I was -extremely- well regarded by colleagues and peers. What I am not is a suck up and I will never chant the party line. So “easy on the eyes” and natural charisma don’t take you as far today because if you aren’t parroting the dogma, it stands out. They (co-workers) were shocked and many are really upset. I am not shocked in the least however because there were signs and rumblings of it for a few months now.The other factor, and this will get you no matter what you do, where you live, and is a tale as old as time. There was a ‘secret’ nepotistic relationship I wasn’t aware of until I was already on a sh-t list. There was this younger guy who was a smarmy little jerk w/ a very punchable face. He and I did not get along because I didn’t roll over for him as others did. He had managed to get a senior position and I couldn’t figure out why, until I did find out, but by then it was too late.What I did -not- know, is that he is also the father of a child. And that child is a grandchild of one of thevice presidentswho is also a major jackass. At least as much as the diversity initiative this sealed my fate. It was not the first time he ran to “grandpa” and whined about someone that didn’t fall in line and those people are gone too. Once I found out about that relationship I knew I was well &amp; truly f-cked. Nepotism is frowned upon for a reason in most companies because this is the kind of stuff that occurs. These two ate dinner together several times a month, I was 100% unaware of all this when I landed on this kid’s sh-t list.Live &amp; learn… I’ve been through too much hardship, trauma &amp; tragedy to let this little speed bump impede me in any way.

            Don’t worry, they can’t run 💩.
We do need to get busy though.  Giving off weak doesn’t just attract predators, it turns the ordinary people into a threat because their billion year instincts evolved to eliminate weakness, a weakling is a threat to all around him.  We’re not even inviting aggression, we’re by our weakness forcing self defense.  Man is a pack animal, a weakling is a threat to everyone.The only racism is Homo Sapiens defending themselves.

        Years ago someone at Occidental Observer coined the neologism “Judaeforming,” to describe this process. Any organism will seek homeostasis, and where it’s not found, it will seek to make those conditions prevail. Even my terrier does this weird thing where she walks around in a circle on her blanket several times before she sits down.Jews are generally 180 degrees away from whites in America on most important issues. The gap is biggest on gun ownership and immigration (Audacious Epigone used to have great graphs on this stuff.) Whether or not you have a right to defend yourself or to say who can enter or not enter your society is a very big thing. And if what makes you comfortable is perceived as an existential threat by someone else, then something has to give. It doesn’t get more zero-sum than that. Conflict is unavoidable even where not intentional. Even if the aliens in “War of the Worlds,” were not hostile, human microbes still would have done them in. Ditto for the Spanish arriving on the American continent in the 15th century.The rule for minorities seems to be: liberal in the diaspora, conservative at home when in the majority. The trick for the people currently running America is convincing the majority to not understand itself as such. This obviously benefits Jews but it requires a not-insignificant number of white traitors. I’ve noticed these people (just like the English communists/Cambridge spies) come from very old, very white and Waspish families. Like everyone else, I’d prefer to think about the JQ because it’s easier, but we have to solve the problem of the horse-faced Boston brahman who lives in New England and has a visceral hatred for normal white people. Ditto for the English MP who has barons and duchesses and even kings in his pedigree who enjoys nothing more than to see your average Scouser terrorized by Muslim immigrants. Eurocentric tendencies toward ingroup altruism might explain normal white people getting suckered by this stuff, and Karl Popper might explain the Jews, but that still leaves a huge problem.

            I tend to think that we have 3 problems to solve:
1.  the group that can’t be named without punishment2.  whites with pathological compassion and an urge to evangelize egalitarianism.  As you mention, they are often of old New England stock.3.  whites who are selfish and sociopathic and only care about their short term success.  These people would kill their mother if the price was right.

                Good summation. Our biggest problems are from whites. It is insane what whites will tolerate and how easy it is for a foreign tribe to get whites to hate each other. University educated whites will believe in and do anything the media tells them so that they will be considered good, smart people.
I would add a 4th point: uni educated white women doing everything possible to betray white men and destroy the culture. No matter how powerful the tribe, the main reason for their success is the old WASP leadership and uni educated white women

                Don’t underestimate #3 on your list either. It’s only getting worse too. There’s been a lot made about recent polls that show how vastly different millennials and gen z are from prior generations. One that’s stuck out is how an enormous amount of them, don’t believe in any religion, do not believe in any absolute morality, and place the ultimate importance on money.I’ve seen this in a family member of my own, a person nominally of the right. He doesn’t like all the anti-white DIE/CRT stuff. However, he openly says, if they pay me enough, I’ll sit in on any indoctrination class and say whatever they want.

                    Some of this might be due to fear. They see the old consensus failing and the DIE stuff spreading and realize that the only safety long term, is just being able to buy your way out of the system somehow. If you can’t rely on friends, relatives, the rule of law, or any common moral values, perhaps money will save you.
Some of the same people would probably also welcome a return to a less venal system backed by a  real authority that did not play games with moral relativism.

            You don’t seem to be familiar with Irish or Scottish politics if  you think the English are especially  anti white. It’s also not the English running the EU. The Biden administration is the least Anglo in the history of the US.One of the odd characteristics of white people is that they really enjoy hating other white people. Working class people often hate on the basis of ethnicity while the upper classes seethe on the basis of class.You yourself like to tilt at the English in pretty much all of your contributions. As an Englishman I would love to see you get yours.

And, in case you hadn’t been paying attention, the posters on this site, almost without exception, heap practically nothing but vitriol and scorn upon the US, so much so that we don’t even call it by its given name. Instead, we call it AINO or the GAE.

Not really. I’ve spoken about the German self-hatred, and said good things about any Englishman who I thought was good/honorable, like Enoch Powell. You might have a point if you said I tend to talk a lot about the New English/Yankee Puritan elite in the comments, as I have been thinking about that issue a lot, lately.
What exactly would me “getting mine” for sharing my opinion on here entail? A duel at twenty paces? I’m all ears.

Yankee Puritans were the first enemy, they are the current enemy, and they will be the last enemy unless they set the world afire first, which seems almost likely. The Evil Tribe, Joggers, trannies and the rest of the clown show will fold like a cheap suit the nanosecond the New England Brahmins are destroyed–again, if they don’t get us all killed first.

            The thing about those Brahmins and Euro Ministers is this:Nonwhites just blithely ignore everything these church ladies say, and go on to hire their own, only applying Brahmin rules as a crowbar to the head of white folk.  Nonwhites pay the Insufferably Pious no attention at all…And the Insufferably Pious ignore that, in turn.  They don’t even notice what nonwhite people do, carelessly dismissing both their f**kups and their nepotism.The highbrow must look at nonwhites like dogs.

        This is where Karl Popper’s famous phrase, “the paradox of tolerance”, comes into the conversation. In order to maintain the tolerant society, you must be intolerant of intolerance…Of course, this is an unresolvable paradox,…I have not listened to the show yet. I apologize for commenting before listening, but I just wanted to touch on this general subject for a moment. As I think I mentioned in a comment some weeks ago, the “paradox of tolerance,” like the barber paradox and other Russell-type paradoxes, are not really all that unresolvable, even at the level of formal logic. Formally, one need only recognize that—in the barber paradox, for example—the term “man” takes on a different arity in different parts of the statement and is therefore used equivocally. The statement of the paradox involves a contextual shift, and the term has slightly different meanings in the different contexts. Thus, it is not entirely the same term, but it uses the same signifier. Therefore there is no paradox.Ordinary language has no trouble understanding this, but formal logic was led into a catastrophe which culminated in the Gödel Incompleteness Theorem. There is a deep and cogent lesson there for anyone wants to contemplate it. How did it come to be that minds of the first order were ever obsessed by trifling problems like this?Part of the reason—the partnotdiscussed in intellectual histories of mathematics—is that people seem to enjoy thefrissonof playing around with ambiguity rather than settling down into the sane, sober, solid resolution of the paradox. This transforms the problem from an intellectual dilemma into an ethical lapse. Ethics is nothing other than the cultivation of moderate and proportionate responses to matters of pleasure and pain. It is the point where the intellectual world oftrue and falseinforms the fleshly world ofgood and bad.To play with ambiguity is a highly refined form of vanity that takes an immoderate pleasure in remaining aloof from the determining realities of lower-arity pains and pleasures. It is the most spiritual, and consequently the most evil, form of cowardice.“Ambiguity,” therefore, is not merely one case, it isthecase—indeed themeta-case, of modern decadence. As we see in the barber paradox, the difficulty arises when one introduces a confusion between asubstance(a man, the barber), and theproperties of a substance(shaving men), and uses the same term for both. In the paradox of tolerance, the substance is society and the property of the substance is open debate, but the form of the argumentation is the same. All Russell-type paradoxes involve a confusion between substances and properties, which are categories of different arity. This particular type of problem is brought to a high pitch precisely in the modern, Western world due to its tendency to etherealize everything into the same world of abstractions and to forget that substances andqualiaare actually real.The enemies of substantial society conceal themselves within the paradox of tolerance. What does this tell you about them? It tells you that they have broached the ethical line into vanity and moral cowardice. The substance of society is of lower arity than its properties. When the properties of a substance are directed against the substance, they are destroying the very being in which they inhere. Ontologically, this is a case of being rebelling against the ground of being. That happens to be the technical definition of Evil.The proponents of ambiguity areevil. We are, no doubt, some number of years short of the point when this fact becomes explicit in a very social and political way, but there is. The philosophical certainty of it can no longer be thrown into doubt. Like an alarm slowly penetrating into the dream of the sleeper, it is present with a dim awareness that must grow until the sleeper awakens.

            Now THAT is class.  I must admit.It is beyond my ken, but please, apply this reasoning to the axiom that “Racism is bad, because one of the First (Trotsky) told us so.”His solution was genocide, torture, terrorism, and slavery for 60 million Orthodox Slavs, because vengeance is the Lord’s.“Our solution should be race mixing, a gentler ethnic cleansing, because racism is bad.  By submitting as women, we could’ve avoided our beating.”In my clumsy way, I’m asking you to contrast the imagined Ideal to the physical Real, as you have done so finely above.The inversion or contradiction is that God created physical diversity, therefore we should strive to erase it in service to Trotsky’s ideal.I am far out of my depth here.I can accept fewer and fewer of the unspoken axioms  and clever arguments assumed by Biblical logic.I will not bow to the Hebrew God. My low cunning tells me we’re being snookered.

                    I won’t link it, but Noah Rothman over at NRO is dissing Tucker because he mentioned Zelensky is persecuting Christians in Neo-Palestine; the implication is Carlson is anti-Semitic. To belabor the obvious, if Zelensky were Orthodox and persecuting Rothman’s fellow tribesmen, there would be a different tune on replay. The ignorant cucks who still take that cuck sewer seriously are pushing back infrequently in the comments.
Things are changing, but we are ruled by sociopaths who will play fast and loose with nukes because they already have indicated that is their endgame. Let’s hope they are stopped.

        Regarding your point that for whites in Vermont, it’s easy to be anti-racist:A lot of the push for inclusion and diversity has to do with Telescopic Philanthropy, in which a person can accrue a massive amount of social capital in this digital age by worrying about abstractions.  They don’t have to bother volunteering in Church, helping a neighbor move, or visiting some old family. The status seekers used to have to work in the community, maybe being annoying busybodies but still actually got things done. Now there’s national attention at their fingertips with the press of a button. This also destroys local bonds, as only a small portion cares you helped Susan down the road with her baby one day.All the social capital is in knowing the performative words to say, like a magical incantation. The ones who are really chronically online will cut their son’s genitals off while the less fanatical leftists nod their agreement in public while ensuring they make as little contact as possible with the crazy lady.

        Popper’s paradox of tolerance demonstrates an important point:  all societies suppress some ideas and people.  Even societies that strive for maximum tolerance will have ideas that you are not allowed to question.When Popper said he wanted an open society, he meant a society in which no immigrants are rejected and no heretical ideas are suppressed.  If you know his ethnicity, it is obvious why he advocated for this.But Popper realized that if he allowed the people who objected to his proposal to exist in his society, then those people would destabilize and possibly destroy his society.So Popper formulated his paradox of tolerance and demonstrated that any society that wants to survive must always suppress some people and ideas.Like Popper, I want a society where almost ideas are open for debate except for a few.  But in my case, the idea that you are not allowed to question is that the highest purpose of our government is to promote the flourishing of white people.

        Great show, thanks. I’d really been looking forward to the Open Society podcast.Years ago, I worked closely with a jewish girl with whom I had very frank and honest discussions about race and crime statistics. It was refreshing to hear someone speak of these things so openly. She often compared pit bull attacks with future microbiologists.One day, she happened to make a comment about the fact that she and her family were worried about some relatives who lived in the inner city because “they are the only white people for miles”. Someone else happened to hear and quietly called her out on it. She quickly reminded them that she is jewish, jews are only 2% of the population, far smaller than the percentage of blacks, and have been “persecuted for centuries”.It was eye opening. There was a unique power and an eternal impunity.

        Totalitarian societies such as ours always present their quest for absolute control as a moral crusade. These types believe as much in an open society as they do in free speech and personal liberty, which is to say they don’t believe in it at all. The stated ideals simply are tools to the unspoken end of a monstrous regime led by an evil few.If anyone could time travel to the past, the first person strangled would be Rosseau, followed by Soros. The former laid the groundwork for the latter to take out humanity. He is well on his way in a manner that eluded the past tyrants.This will end in flames, debris and mass death because it cannot end otherwise.

            Just so. The so-called “open society” is nothing more than a chimera and a shibboleth. At the end of the day it’s just a case of who/whom? Who gets to call themselves tolerant? And whom do the tolerant refuse to tolerate?

        Speaking of tolerance, Nick Fuentes told a room full of black women that black people have lower IQ, and its genetic, with 100k watching live.  They were more concerned that he said “nigg@.”

            DavidcitoYou know why they were “tolerant” of Nicks comment? It’s because, deep down, at a visceral level, they know it’s true.Why do you think the Magic One and Mike are always pouting and look like they just smelled a wet one?It’s because that after two presidencies, becoming millionaires, and having people worship them, they’re still just a couple of inferior joggers. They know it. And it galls the living shit out of them.You could make The Magic One king of the universe, and they would still be pissed off at whitey.Boy, that meandered quite a bit.

                have looked up both Michelle’s and also John Lewis’s AIMs (accomplishments, innovations and merit) career stats, I find eerily similar trajectories which I suspect is the case for many affirmative action recipients. A softballed degree from a prestigious college, followed by a short stint as a do-nothing legal associate in Uncle Bubba’s “show up and get paid” private law firm, then a few years of community activism, followed by either marriage to or a campaign for “the next Governor/Senator from the great state of insert name here”.

            That event was a disappointment. I hoped he learned his lesson from the Kanye West fiasco, but the narcotic of minor celebrity does not let loose its grip easily. Maybe it is because I live in a black city, but I thought he looked ridiculous. Black people were laughing at him.

                I’m beginning to wonder if he’s even Catholic. He could’ve done very well growing a Christian nationalist movement and organizing get-togethers, online or otherwise. But he seemingly worships social validation and frivolous worldly things, and he’s certainly not glorifying Christ by going on shows populated by overweight blacks in tunics.

                Its sad, even more so because he’s a spent asset that won’t be discarded. The cliché goes its better to burn out than fade away, but insgrad he flamed out and refuses to fade. I know old geezers aren’t supposed to like new stuff and young people getting approval from old geezers (the eatablishment) is a sign of conformity, but I genuinely liked the guy.

                I don’t remember if it was Z Man or someone else who said it, but I have read Fuentes has as bad or worse in person social skills than the average person his age.  You get him in front of a camera and he flips a switch but he can’t communicate to people face to face.

                The Kayne decision indicates the reason that I have trouble connecting with paleoconservatives and MAGA-types below 30:  they grew up idolizing rappers.
At a formative age, they bonded with black stars and still subconsciously worship them and crave their approval.
When I deal with these guys, I think that I can feel this, and it is an unbridgeable gap between us.  It’s not their fault, but it’s real.

                    Good point. But, to a lesser extent, what you say applies to most white men who came of age in the mid-70s or later. It was at that point that America began worshiping negro sportsball players, and young white boys were hit very hard by that phenomenon. I know I was. And it took me approximately 35 years to slough off that conditioning. I imagine most never do and never will.

                        Good point.  I’ll just add that I bonded at a formative age with some real scumbags, for example, Bon Scott of AC/DC or the guys in Kiss.  My parents were distraught.  But while these people were degenerates, they weren’t of a race that sees me at the enemy.  (I know about the ethnicities of some of the guys in Kiss, but they anglicized their names and were white presenting.)  I’ve had to go through a similar deprogramming of myself to stop subconsciously admiring those guys.

                    The state of the youngish right is dire.I doubt the extent of his reach but supposedly our boys love Andrew Tate, whose message to them is that they’re losers if they’re not wiggers—and not just any wiggers, but caricatures of already caricatural blacks.Keith Woods might inspire some kids to pick up some serious books, but he himself only uses them to find convoluted ways of never fully disagreeing with the establishment.Fuentes is flagrantly homosexual, and the gang he’s assembled is a menagerie of absolute creeps and ten-time losers.Young guys interested in our thing are being taken in by something else.
