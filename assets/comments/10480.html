        “Katie McHugh is a nobody in the grand scheme of things, but her corpse on the sidewalk sends the same message as the Seth Rich bike rack outside DNC headquarters.”

        The last few days have confirmend my suspiscions about the Western elite, they’re Liberal in every way.
Left in social issues, Neoliberal in economic issues, its really Globalism vs Nationalism. The new Irish Prime Minister is a gay Indian (dots not feather) who economically is Tatcherite, just look at Macron, its the same policies!

        I’m a bit confused on why Breitbart keeps caving in and firing their staff whenever the neocons or CNN demands it.

            The insularity of the mass media is what drives this. Exactly no one gave a crap about this outside the tiny little world of neocon nutters, who can be ignored.

                Don’t the folks who run Breitbart understand that their readers give zero shits about outrage among the neocons and mainstream media?  Politicians from Hungary and Poland said basically the same thing as Katie McHugh today.

                    When lefties and cucks control access to press passes and press briefings then Breitbart and other opposition press have to give a fuck what they think (even if privately they don’t). That sniveling leftoid Chomsky had something to say about this in Manufacturing Consent.

                I think that things are progressing quite well at the moment. The spread of Right culture though the internet is still the most important task so as to build a broad base of supporters.
I think the second phase of this should be the masculinity aspect of the Right, so that men can grow a pair and take action on their own initiative.
Thirdly, we need to develop a playbook like Alinsky’s, Rules for Radicals for the Right, so that when people decide to act they do so intelligently.
By the way. Great blog.

            It’s no coincidence that Steve Bannon is no longer at the helm of BB.Katie being fired would have never happened if he was still there.
He went on to the front lines of the culture war to serve with Trump. That battle position was far more important than BB ever could be.
She was taken out by a neocon rear guard action for speaking the truth. Andrew would have never allowed this to happen. Hope Bannon does something to rescue her.

        Unfortunately, most of the “Dirt People” have to work for a living. Whores like Soros and Suckerberg have billions to waste on implementing ideology. Personally, I don’t think either of these two have any real say so and they are obviously serving someone else. But, until the Dirt People get a few billionaire sugar daddies, the left will always run circles around them. The left tries to imply that people like the Kochs are financing conservative agendas. This is ludicrous. They are neocons and have similar agendas to those on the left.

            They don’t need billionaires. Set up a dues paying organization. Call it the Ancient Order of Kek or something innocuous. Set dues at $50.00 a year or so.The club into uses the funds to fund a PAC like the NRA does and have a legal branch like Judicial Watch, Additional funds raised can be used to help victims of the cloud people, fund.Sell swag like Kek cups, Pepe frogs, t-shirts, for extra revenue, etc.Get a million dirt people to join and it solves your funding problem.The fly in the ointment is this. You have to carefully vet the people who run it. No global-RINO’s, no tribesmen, no feminists.

                Like I said, the “Dirt People” have to work. When you have a family, you have to support them. That’s not conducive for creating a game changing organization. Plus, if that had any chance of success, it would be infiltrated very early on in the process. I’m sure Andrew Breitbart trusted his inner core. Here it is, 2017 and it is obvious Breitbart is another front for the elite and is a dialectic shill that passes for the conservative voice.

                    For god sakes no sugar daddy is going to come along and do all your work. It makes our side look as bad as the snowflakes or the Peanuts gang waiting for the Great Pumpkin to arrive.The NRA model works and works well. It’s better than nothing and doesn’t require people to give up their family. Just some dues and participating in local events, etc.Sure the Progs and FBI will try to infiltrate it. The thing is you vet people in charge. You look at their past – which really can’t be hidden and if it’s a blank it’s clear that the person has no place in a position of authority. You also keep the nuts out like those with the John Brown complex like the Bundy’s.or 3%’ers who are totally compromised by the FBI.AS for Breitbart he wasn’t poisoned, he was a nobody and not a threat. The alt-right wasn’t even a pimple when he croaked.   Trump is a threat and game changer.this is why the establishment went rabid over him.Look one of the problems with the right is that it’s people are lazy and anti-social to a large extent. It’s almost impossible to get them to work together on anything. The Left exploits that. The Left achieved what it has by working with people  and organizing at the local level building networks of people to help the cause. They get their people into power and punish those who get in their way. .

        The problem with using the courts is how much can you rely on the judge applying the law as it stands and not being an activist prick like the ones blocking Trump’s travel ban. The UK has the problem of the CPS simply declining to prosecute cases it doesn’t like and falling over themselves to prosecute the ones it does. The judges can’t be relied upon any more.

            Good example of using their rules against them. If the denial of the travel ban goes to the Supreme Court, and the denial is based on Trump’s campaign-time comments, then RBG cannot rule against Trump because of her campaign-time comments.  Hold the old fartbag to it.

        ALL the Western elites are progressive, or at least sympathetic to progressive ideology and socially harmful policies.  Yes, and that includes 99% of the Republicans in office.  The Republicans have slim but real majorities in both houses and I’ve yet to hear any meaningful plan for rolling back 50 years of failed social justice nonsense.  Gays can still serve openly in the military (and get their sex changes paid for with tax dollars), universities/schools are now organizing commencements for certain racial/ethnic groups only in addition to the main commencement, elementary, middle and high schools are still teaching PC infused bullshit with everyday, etc.  The Republican leaders in Congress think they can focus on just two issues to prove their credentials and get re-elected:  repeal and replace the failing system set up under the ACA and reforming the idiotic federal tax code.  I’ve seen this movie before back in the 1980s.  Reagan et al thought that if they simply beefed up national defense, reformed the tax code and faced down the Soviet Union, all else would fall back into normality.  But we all know that not only did changes in society not reverse but accelerated in the same, wrong direction.  Republican leaders really act as if solving monetary and tax/fiscal issues will repair the damage wrought on American society or the national psyche by 50 years of social policy agitation by the liberals.  I’ve said for two decades now that if America wants to keep its soul it must not only stop but reverse the social trends of the last 50 years.  One very important way to achieve this is reform of the education system at all levels.  No more using grammar schools to teach social justice theory.  No more using the military as a laboratory for progressive social policies.  Forcing judges, if need be by getting rid of life tenure of judges required under Article III of the Constitution,  to accept they are not there to make law but interpret and enforce laws decided by the will of the majority as expressed by their elected representatives (And along the way, denying judges any additional protection by the US Marshal’s Service so that they have to live in society just like everyone else.).  Bottom line:  the only way to change the direction of America from future socialist failed state is to start with reform at the grassroots level and force changes upward.

            It’s HIGHLY unlikely that you’re going to “reform” the educational system.  The MUCH more likely answer to the problem is REPLACEMENT.
Send your children somewhere else.  Home school them.  Etc.   There are alternatives – and they choice of alternatives is growing quickly.
This is the problem with the so-called right and Christians in general – they will send their children into the liberal run schools – and then wonder why those children are then captured by liberal dogma.
You can’t fix stupid.

        Obvious place to start is looking at Donald Trump. I am fond of a Grond analogy – he is breaking the door of the Cathedral but it is orc and troll infantry that have to finish the job.
also somebody page alt right and paleocon luminaries to stop with the whining about the great cuckening. trump is the best you will get. especially now when the battle of five armies in the gulf is happening.

        Just looking at the facts and circumstances, this bust is entirely _too_ perfect.  Stupid millennial radicalized white girl, check. Short time contractor, check.  Access to NSA’s at large, non-comπromentalized data base despite having no reason to know, WTF_?  Tangential but not dispositive circumstantial evidence of Russian probing of tangential but not essential US election-type software (blue states mainly), check.
So a minnow bit on the trolling bait and now the hook has to be cleared else no steelheads will be caught, I guess.

        ” he who tattle tale first wins ”  It’s a childish reaction to a confrontation. Conservatives are more mature and avoid such behavior.Unfortunately the left is very infantile. Running on pure emotion they make  complete asses of themselves on a regular basis.One would think the natural reaction to some vile hag accosting  a paying customer would be having her removed immediately..Instead they revoke that man’s membership for fear of repercussion by the  The Lunatic Left. Had he called the cops , obtain restraining order, pressed charges etc. like Z mentioned they would have at least stayed neutral on the matter.Have no desire to stoop to the levels of these pathetic losers, but think we all have to start thinking a little bit smarter on dealing with these moonbats.

        Don’t know about lawsuits.  I guess that’s the Paul Weston side of things.  Being willing to suffer for Truth and Beauty is the Tommy Robinson side of things — not that Paul Weston isn’t also willing to suffer.  (I think that Paul Weston visits this site — he’s the Archbishop of the Anglosphere.)  Things change when people are ready to die or at least suffer years of imprisonment for Truth and Beauty.  (I’m not saying that I am, or telling anyone else to.)

        Lawfare is very effective. I saw a black sovereign citizen driving around without a car tag, and unasked my local police detective how he can get away with it. The detective said the fbi gave them a seminar saying don’t mess with the SS. The SS will go down and start filing lawsuits, that are a big hassle to deal with.

            And what is it that “we guys” are selling?  Oh yes, I’m sure, “hate.”  But it seems to me that hate makes the world go ’round.  Muzzies exploding themselves and others all across the West from hate.  Hate of normal America was the organizing theme of the Hillary campaign, and that hate, and Trump hate, keeps the Democratic Party going.  The Left in general has been about nothing but hate since the 1970s (see also: the opposite rule of liberalism, aka SJWs Always Project).  Hate is the only thing that gets perpetually-aggrieved college kids out of bed in the morning, and “help us hate Whitey” has been the sole principle of academia, not to mention the media, Hollywood, and the rest of the edutainment racket, for going on 60 years now.  Hate is The Spice, the only thing holding our ramshackle neo-feudal empire together (such as it is, and for what that’s worth).  Seems to me that people do indeed want what “we” are selling, and considering that student loan debt now exceeds every other form of debt in America, they’re willing to pay a pretty penny to get it.  If the SEC regs allowed it, I’d go long on hate.  Very, very long….as you guys are likely about to discover.

                Yes they do hate. I experienced it as a 17 year old facing gangs of 20’s something commie warriors back in 1977.

            Trent, what do the forty-five percenters want? And how did you learn so much about their hopes and aspirations? Do you spend time with, say, Teamsters who don’t vote?Let me assure you that such people do exist. For instance, one such person, a truck driver, explained part of his thinking this way: “They [the Democrats] want to fuck with my guns.” He and I didn’t discuss the Teamsters’ evident committment to the multicultie train, but I’m pretty sure that he’s not interested in turning America into a borderless paradise for every third world welfare tourist who plans visit at his expense.“Turnout	54.7% (estimated)”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_of_2016

            Amazing that the left that can’t do math can say we are outnumbered.So was Cortez – with firearms and armor – by the Aztecs with arrows.They want what we are selling.  Heard of food?  Perhaps the dirt people should deny them.You mean the magic EBT/SNAP cards don’t magically create food?
