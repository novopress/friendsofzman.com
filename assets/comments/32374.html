        Obama has handlers like every other politician. The guy really isn’t impressive and doesn’t sound intelligent. He got elected because Dems found a black man who didn’t speak ebonics, and Whites thought they would get into Heaven by proving they weren’t racist and voting for a Black man.

                Joe Biden: “They’re gonna put y’all back in chains!”Joe Biden: :”If you’re black and you don’t vote for me, you’re not black.”
Ok, Joe, I get it: I can tell you are down with the brothers.
What I don’t get is the brothers being down with him. Pandering and Pleading 101, from a dude who would get hives if his skin rubbed against an actual negro, yet they vote for him.
Hopeless people.

                When you look at the Venereal Disease statistics, you’d have to be a literal retard to consent to receiving a Kamala BJ.

Do you suppose Hillary ever even gave a man a BJ?
Both Kamala &amp; Hillary have great big nasty sharp buck teeth; not good for BJs.
Not good at all.

                Some j00, named “Zitner”, has a piece at the Wall Street Journal, about how “America’s New Political War Pits Young Men Against Young Women”
Gee, ya think, Massa J00?
It’s certainly not as though your race has invested trillions of dollars over the last century &amp; a half in order to create this “New Political War”.
Ow-Schwitz II, the sequel, simply cannot be released to theaters near you soon enough.

            He had about 25 cliches at his disposal. I never heard him say one original thing. I never heard a novel turn of phrase. I never heard a single difficult word. he was and is a stupido who probably doesn’t even know how the world of power works.

            Everything is relative.  You must look at pre-President Obama as compared to his Black caucus in Congress.  Obama stood out.  He knew how to speak to Whites—rather than simply grunt Ebonics to Blacks, hell he was grifting Whites for over a decade prior in Chicago.  He knew how *not* to be threatening.When he became President, he had the last laugh.  As to cliches and think time, I never got a hint of that when I listened to his smaller of the cuff discussions with crowds.  However, I admit to not listening much to him as listening to Leftists just makes you stupid.  If you want to talk stupid, then look no further that Bush II, Obama’s predecessor.  Everything said in the negative about Obama could be said about Bush the lessor—except Bush got us into the sand wars.

                    That would be massive. Given that we await the FNG singularity, like Linus in the garden awaiting the Great Pumpkin, a Harris/Levine ticket would resolve the “end of history” question. And we’d be there! The Event Horizon!
Sadly it appears that the puppet masters don’t want another “exotic” as Veep.  A boring white guy is required. Of course the Dems are running short on boring white guys. They’ll have to re-stock.
addendum: OMG, it just occurred to me: David French. Seriously, a Harris/French ticket would kick ass. Maybe not as FNG as Levine, but still, massive, tubular even.

                            That’s for sure. We live in Arizona. In 2020 my wife and I happened onto and joined a Trump train (caravan) that required 2 hour and 45 minutes to pass a given point. A few weeks before Biden and Harris had made an appearance in Phoenix that was attended only by reporters even though it was open to the public. Zero attendees.
No worries: Biden won the fortified vote.

                By happenstance, I recently finishedFamily Favorites, a novel about Elagabalus written by Alfred Duggan. And I’m pretty sure I heard the name Duggan over at Sev’s HQ, which is a notorious music blog. The novel is fantastic, and includes references to the Galli of Cybele and the Spintrians (see Suetonius, the Life of Tiberius).
I find it extremely interesting that with the rise of the New Secular Religion Cult we also see the resurrection of ancient religious hallmarks such as gelding men in service of goddesses.

                    Alfred Duggan produced some really good stuff and is sadly under appreciated today. Might have been me mentioning him with reference to Conscience of the King.
His brother Hubert Duggan was an interesting character, too.

            Great point, I have often considered this many times myself. Even the “collapse” of Rome (usually given as 476 A.D.) is an artificial, post hoc event defined by historians looking backwards. From the perspective of a contemporary Roman, all they did was shift the imperial capital to Constantinople, where the empire continued for another thousand years.
So it’s possible the fake and gay U.S. can continue almost indefinitely.
On the other hand… the Austro-Hungarian, Romanov, German and Soviet empires collapsed practically overnight.
So you really never can tell for sure.

                One way or the other, the present velocity of information will determine whether it is fast or slow. That is the primary difference, I think, from the past examples. It also explains why the Regime seeks so desperately to control the new channels of information.

Initiation into Ukrainian corruption was finishing school for American boomer politicians’ kids. Why? Why was every white hooker in ’90s America from the Ukraine? We used to wonder. Then Putin joined the war and everyone forgot a century of foreshadowing.

                    And the “Roman” empire survived until 1453 when the Turks took Constantinople. I look at the GAE; will it survive? Sure, if it relocates to places like Davos or Auckland. In our age you can run the Empire from anywhere. It’s not like anyone will drop a nuke on Switzerland or New Zealand.

                This is the question: A sudden collapse, or a long sunset period?Without external challenges, an empire can deteriorate slowly and even show intermittent, illusory signs of recovery. As late as 395, the year Theodosius died, the Roman Empire would still have been seen from the outside as a cohesive and formidable entity. Yet seen from the inside (had any contemporary had the historical perspective we have), the Empire had lost its original “Roman” character by 250 or thereabouts. It had devolved – like the GAE – into a system of internal plunder by armies and tax collectors.Yet it lingered, because people didn’t know how to create a workable alternative.I have tried to imagine life as a 4th or 5th century farm hand, or stevedore, or small town mayor, I don’t know where to start. All we have is the “big picture”, an Empire in two centuries of decline, followed by a relatively quick collapse after the death of Theodosius,

                    Dementia doesn’t cause several inches difference in height, sorry.
Jill is 5’6″.  Joe is listed as 6’0″.  The Joe speaking outside was estimated as 6’8″.  (One wag calls him “the Chinballs Joe”, due to a markedly cleft chin.)
Jill, ever by his side, suddenly decided to jaunt to Paris on or near the day of his fateful decision?
We’re up to at least 8 versions of Joe now.  Who needs AI?

                        I find Mercouris’s talks unwatchable, not because of his stutter, but because he seldom has anything useful to say. In 70 minutes of speaking he might deliver 5 minutes of information. The other Alexander–Christofouru–is pretty much the same but without the stutter. I tried watching them for a couple of months and just gave up.

                In defense of The Duran, they offer fantastic insights regarding geopolitics, especially on the endless proxy wars waged by GAE. When it comes to US politics, it’s one of their weaker areas. However they had an interesting conversation with Robert Barnes yesterday, so check it out and you’ll get a more American perspective on our current clown show.  Barnes has intriguing things to say about the Biden puppet show.

                Sometimes I get hopeful they are using the term, “neocon,” for another problem group to get past the censors. That is probably misplaced.On the other hand, there is a ton of noticing happening in the comments on The Duran’s videos. I’m honestly surprised YouTube has allowed those to stay up.Of the two I prefer Alex C (beard guy). Alex M’s accent is not my favorite, and he is not as intelligent as he thinks he is. Alex C has his own channel so I usually watch that.That said, the walk and talks + online store are a pretty good business model. One take, very low overhead in terms of equipment and time. Supplement that with ad revenue and super chats and they’re probably making decent money.

            The idea that a lazy, poof like Obama is some Machiavellian mastermind manipulating things from behind the scenes is absurd. He was an empty suit elevated by the usual suspects when he was president. What makes people think that he’s anything different now.
Of course, Obama, being the shallow narcissist that he is, probably believes that he is that figure, but believing something doesn’t make it so.

As a case in point, Obama apparently believed he had influence in who came after Biden. The man apparently never had the clarity to see he is nothing more than a glorified lawn jockey for the ruling class, and certainly his narcissism prevents an acknowledgment that he is a has-been now. The apparatchiks who handled him are more likely to know they are being purged.

                    Obama does have some influence, obviously not as much as he thought, as he can’t get rid of Kamala.  Yes Obama is a dumb actor but the people he is jockeying for power with are just a group of tards who think they are the smartest people to ever live.  It isn’t like he is some remarkably dumb outlier in Democratic politics.

                        And yet I recall a rodeo clown getting fired and cancelled for using a dummy that looked like BO as a prop for the bulls. As much as I hate to say it, I think most of rural AINO collapses like a K-Mart pup tent in a twister whenever the Leftist Power Structure applies the least bit of pressure to it. Viz the Boy Scouts, as well.

                The fact that Obama IS a shallow narcissist who does believe he is that figure is what makes him so useful to those same usual suspects. When you look at someone like Hillary Clinton, I think it is obvious that she does want a say, she does want that power, she wants to exercise that power, but Obama is quite happy to look good in a suit, hang out with celebrities, and bask in the adulation of the media and the proles. You saw this in his 2008 campaign but it never really stopped (for example, I always thought the President of the United States picking NCAA brackets from the White House was extremely cringe but it got him a lot of attention).

                    One hundred percent. Z mentioned it the other day, but a new phenomenon is diversity hires who actually believe they are qualified (put aside entitled).

                            The VP isn’t even a job with actual responsibilities, unless the President decides to give you actual responsibilities. By all accounts the Biden entity did not give her responsibilities, save for one (some sort of “border czar”). She was so bad at it, though, that the media is now lying to pretend she never actually had that responsibility. Her one job was just to stay alive (assassination insurance) and not be an idiot who gives bad press to the WH. She failed at even that, though, as her office was a wasteland of incompetence, turnover, and chatty gossip to the press.Even if you assume that the same people who staffed up the Biden admin would staff up the Kamala admin, and it would be a ruthless minyan of America-hating lefties, her White House could be a truly epic disaster. Which, you know, might be the best thing that could happen at this point in our country’s history.

It is going to be hell on earth, but it has to happen some time and I suspect you are right this would be the trigger.  As we have seen with the current clown, these pricks are not hesitant to put us at risk of nuclear annihilation for feelz and profits. The economic deprivation certain to accompany a Harris Administration may make nuclear winter seem appealing.

                    Him (or more likely some recent college grad on his staff) picking brackets has been a useful service to the gambling public since 2009.  I believe he’s only got the winner right once or twice in all that time (and those were with huge pre-tourney favorites), so it is always helpful to make sure he doesn’t have your winning team.

                    All the same, it remains a fact that most former Presidents don’t make DC their home base. Reportedly visitors come and go at all hours. Obama probably isn’t the secret power behind the throne, but isn’t it likely that he’s still a player in the Byzantine politics of Washington?

                        Doubtful.  You obviously not been in close contact with such people.Obama is most likely at least a SD above the average (IMO), with a great ability in the language arts.  This might make him a midwit, but definitely not a below average intellect.  Before being president he was quite adept at gaming the system for grants and working the Black poverty grift and of course was a graduate of elite high schools and universities.  I’ll leave out Obama’s law degree as at that time AA was beginning to take hold with a vengeance.  No one can completely trust that such advanced degree is a proxy for high Black intelligence after 1960.As has been noted, he had a White mother and his father, the Kenyan, was a student outside of the country,  graduated as an economist from the US (IIR), and was employed both by his government and foreign firms as an economist.  In short, he was no ordinary “African”.  This was before 1960’s and AA.Obama’s mother earned a PhD in anthropology from the University of Hawaii. She was no ordinary “average” IQ—remember, this is the late 50’s, early 60’s.  Yes, she was a coal burner and had no self respect, but is that related to intelligence?Although there is a basis for predicting IQ from parent’s racial stock averages, there also is allowance for both parents being“outliers” in their own right.  The assumption of regression to the mean does not in this case indicate one should average say, 100 with say, 85 and assume a subaverage IQ.  Nothing in the above description of Obama’s parents precludes an above average IQ for Obama.Really, all this historical parental information is easily Googled and IQ deduced from simple knowledge of HBD IQ principles.   Try it next time.

                                None of what you said changes the assertion I made regarding *how* to estimate (broadly, there are equations and such) of Obama’s IQ.  Yes, if you change his father, then you change input variables.
Hell, if he was not born in the USA, then he should have not been President at all…but as repeatedly stated, we are now a lawless society and the end of such is quite predictable.  Bush II, then Obama, then Trump, followed by Biden, now Harris are simply symptoms, not the cause.  In that light, Obama’s IQ is an “academic exercise” and pretty meaningless.

                            You seem to have a detailed knowledge here. Thus, I’m surprised that you seem to have bungled regression to the mean and its implication for heritability of traits, IQ in this example. Indeed, race has nothing to do with it, at least not directly. Let’s pretend both the parents were of the same race. That race has a mean IQ of 100. Very well, now you tell me that in this case both parents were +1 SD which would be about IQ = 115. The naïve will think that having two bright (or even genius) parents will make it likely that the offspring too will be smarter than the norm. But that’s an invalid conclusion. Regression to the mean says that the child(ren) will most likely center around the group population’s norm, not that of the parents. Since two different races are involved in the Obama case, I’d say that the earlier estimate given of an IQ=95 is not an unreasonable guess. You are correct when you say that nothing precludes an above-average IQ for Obama, but if that is his actual state, he’s an outlier, the exception that proves the rule. By the laws of averages, you’re going to get a whole shitload of Snoop Doggy Dogs for every Clarence Thomas.

                                There was no implication of race having to do with anything—per se.  It is a IQ proxy and was mentioned/intimated by the immediate commenter I responded to.  We often say that US Blacks have an average IQ of 85,  Whites have an average IQ as standardize upon 100.  This seems to be declining and we see a lot of White European countries as being around 98 or so.  But those are simply quibbles for the purposes of the argument.Regression to the mean is often discussed as an explanation why two high IQ parents produce offspring higher in than normal IQ, but not quite reaching the parents’ averaged high IQ.  And yes, you can combine the parent’s IQ in some form for comparison—crude, but often done.  And yes, each parent has a group population mean.Here’s where I differ—I believe bright parents do have a “propensity” to produce brighter children on the average—and it’s not simply due to environmental factors.  And yes, they also produce a “Paris Hilton” every so often.You would have us believe that bright outliers would produce children around the parents group mean, which would entail no advantage—assuming White population average of 100 IQ.  Or would you now wish to believe that every person has a specific group average, not necessarily at 100?Regression means “approaching”, not necessarily reaching.  Indeed, if two “outliers” mated and the product of their mating included none of the genotype that made them “outliers”, Darwinian theory takes a hit.  Hell, with your assumption, you’d have a difficult time explaining Darwin and his illustrious family lineage.  Look it up.In this country, we measure Black IQ as averaging 85, yet the racial stock from West Africa is in the 70’s?  Why?  Well, for one, the typical American Black is 25% *White* admixture.  Hummm, is this something along the line of Charles Murray’s concept (he most likely did not originate such) of “assortive mating”.Charles Murray, in his book, “Coming Apart” discusses two anonymous communities (real data, all White, false names) as an illustration of assortive mating—Belmont and Fishtown. Belmont represents an affluent, educated upper-class neighborhood, while Fishtown symbolizes a working-class, less educated, and more dysfunctional neighborhood.The results are of course stark in every measure of behavior and intelligence across a period of years.  Belmont folk mix with Belmont folk and pass on their (better) genetics.  Fishtown the same, but with worse genetics.Murray does not even question this assertion, but laments in essence that the Fishtowners don’t have access to the better quality Belmont genome.  (Please, don’t ascribe my crude characterization to Murray.  He has class, I don’t.  But I believe he’s inferring the same thing I said above without saying the dreaded “g” word.)This is getting long, but I’ll end it with the note that what you wrote above ***is*** standard fair in explanation.  You are therefore ***not*** incorrect.  I do not buy into this explanation for the roughly stated rationale above.  So I should have been clearer in my initial discussion.All things being said, take your explanation and then take mine and see which one better fits observations.  From my personal perspective and family history, it fits perfectly as an explanation of where I came from and where I am today.

                    Ed Dutton has *estimated* Obama’s IQ as a thought experiment as he does any number of other celebrities.  Whether Obama is very intelligent or not is beside the point.  It’s the process and thought behind the estimation technique(s) he uses.  This has been done by another in the field of HBD.  I believe Peter Frost has done this numerous times (IIR) on his blog.  The final result is not the goal, it’s the journey.

                            “My most sincere apologies for once taking a certain tone with Compsci, I deeply regret it, not being fit to shine his shoes.)”Geez thanks, I think, but really I can’t even remember an untoward word from you in the past. Indeed, if I see your post, I’m sure to read it carefully.Here’s a story, shamed to relate it, but your post above brings it to mind. When wife and I awhile back purchased new home to retire, we bought, of course, a lot of new furniture.One item we were happy to get rid of was the old king sized bed. Wife bought a trendy new bed frame in one of those upscale places only women seem to know of. We then went to look for a new mattress and box springs to fit the bed frame.Here in my berg, “Mattress Firm” is the big seller of such. There’s one on every corner. Their reputation however is terrible and they are known for being a rip off. Long story short, we were greeted by a Black salesman who could “charm the panties off a nun” as they say. In less than 30 minutes this young Black guy had sold me a $5k mattress and springs—which lasted about 3 years or so!Stupid is as stupid does—as Forest Gump would say. No one need shine my shoes, I can be as dumb as the next fellow given the right circumstances. 🙁

            Saying Obama pulls the strings buys them cheap narrative points. “See, in America a black man can become the most powerful man in the country”.  Not that he’s he just a tool of the billionaire classsimilar thing with Hakeem Jeffries being integral to Bidens decision and that he had some straight talk with the old man because, he’s you know, a seriously powerful black man in charge of the party. Not that he’s just a token who has no real power of his ownon a related note I see some cheap narrative points with the israel thing, that they knew Oct 7 was going to happen and let it.   Not that the mossad ain’t what it used to be, oh no, it was all intentional because the mossad is still the bestest most impossibly greatest spy agency in the world and the Jews are so amazingly brilliant of course and masters of all things tech.

                    I agree with your points 2 and 3. But viruses can’t be engineered? Now, I’d probably label that claim “mostly true” if by “engineer” you mean that a virus can be created out of raw materials to any intricate specification desired, e.g. perhaps to kill only people of a certain family line. On the other hand, if you allow a broader definition, various types of genetic tinkering have been ongoing for decades in the name of research as well as — perhaps — classified reasons. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which it’s almost certain you’ve caught at least once, is (almost surely) originally a genetically engineered virus. It’s my understanding that an entire virus can be sequenced from the building blocks, although how “engineered” this might be is up for debate.

                        We can’t engineer a virus. The willingness to believe that we can tinker around with things the scale of non-living chemicals and get a result when we don’t really understand how viruses are even spread is really about wanting humans to have more control than we do.Proper engineering requires testing and design. We can’t test and we certainly can’t design.There is an entity that might be smart enough to engineer a virus but it’s not human.

        There is NO reality to ANYTHING our government does. The Feds, recently came out with “new” floodplain regulations. I, being a not so Civil Engineer, will have to deal with them on any government contract my firm takes.This is a quote: ‘‘utilize a systematic, interdisciplinary approach which will ensure the integrated use of the natural and social sciences and the environmental design arts in planning and in decision making which may have an impact on man’s environment.’’.This means nothing. It has no basis in reality. It’s like a magic incantation performed at some ancient temple five thousand years ago to gain favor with the gods. It’s constant, and it’s all so very very tiresome.

            What this means is that you have to hire some brand new consulting firm made up of vibrants with sociology degrees who will charge you top dollar to make you feel bad for building something on the soil that they say rightfully belongs to the native american they have on staff. I think the prayer to the gods five thousand years ago actually had far more legitimacy than this does.

        While I wait for approval of my other comment, the question with the lawfare against VDARE being now extended to everyone, it was never ever going to stop with Trump, what are dissidents to do?I would suggest the Stalingrad strategy. The Red Army was inferior in  1942 to German artillery, tanks, and aircraft, so they settled for a close in street fight that negated those advantages and started to bleed the German Army of its forces, particularly its officer and non-com leadership via brutal street fighting. The Germans could not bring in their own artillery and tanks and planes for fear of killing their own men.We, as dissidents, should seek to cancel those like that Grandma in Home Depot whenever and wherever we can. This was the tactic used by LA Area Law Enforcement in the late 1990s against the LA gangs, then a massive problem. There were mass gang sweeps that imprisoned lots and lots of dudes with teardrop tattoos on their faces, often far away. The biggest and baddest gang leader without followers is nothing, that was the method also used against Pablo Escobar by Counter Spike as detailed by Mark Bowden in his book “Killing Pablo.”The permanent bureaucracy depends upon not just the compliance but the active participation of people like the Home Depot Grandma with purple problem hair regretting Trump was not killed and thus setting public acceptable opinion. We need to make people as uncomfortable and cancelled as possible. There is no point in building anything as people like Letitia James will simply destroy it, but that same tactic in Red States and localities can also be used.At a resource level, Home Depot cashiers lack the ability to fund responses to cancellations. So we should take the easy cancellations when and where we can.

        Re: DelawareAlong with Tennessee and Mississippi, Delaware is one of the three remaining states that maintain a “dual” court system with equity courts (chancery courts) and law courts (circuit, etc., courts). The dual court system was universal in all Anglo-American jurisdictions until the last century. Chancy/equity courts in dual systems exclusively handle corporate matters. This is why corporations form in Delaware, or at least did until a Woke judge there took away Elon Musk’s compensation package.Credit card companies and to a lesser extent insurance companies handpick the legislators and by extension the chancellors in Delaware. They have an absolute lock on the system, and insert dim politicians into office to do their bidding. Biden fit the bill, and carried water for credit card companies the entirety of his career. Take note that while he was vice president and LARP’ed as president, no progressive legislation to curtail usury and loose credit came close to passing.Harris is the tech equivalent of Biden, but there seems to be a political divide forming in that field, which does not depend on special court systems, friendly judges, and pliant politicians. That may be the only reason she will not win while Biden supposedly did. I absolutely would not place a bet on this election or put too much on the line as to predicting the outcome as a result. I will predict it is the last one ever in the United States with even a question of the outcome, though.

            I was pretty sure the reason the credit card companies moved to Delaware was usury laws. I was correct.https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/why-so-many-of-your-credit-cards-come-from-delaware
Once SCOTUS said banks could “export their interest rates” to other states, by which they meant offer credit cards to people in other states at whatever rate their home state charged, the race was on for a state with no usury laws. Delaware governor Pierre DuPont cut a deal with the NY banks and the rest is history.

                From the linked article:
At the time, several major banks were already incorporated there because of the state’s Chancery Court, where corporate cases are heard by judges, not juries, and resolved faster. The Chancery Court has long made the state an appealing place for businesses to incorporate for legal benefits. In fact, two-thirds of all publicly traded companies today are incorporated in Delaware, according to the state’s website.
They could have landed anywhere. I don’t know if other governors made similar offers, but the court system sealed the deal.

                the fact that most credit cards have interest rates around 30% and also the astronomical Payday loan crime family, is a total abomination of our credit laws and consumer protection.
Ralph Nader alluded to the fact that there are many doing time in prison for loan sharking who charged far less egregious rates. Progress.

                Maybe I misunderstood the system, but Cook County (I think it is there) has separated law and equity courts within a unified circuit court system. Maybe the judges don’t have concurrent jurisdictions, dunno, but if so that is the same as the three I mentioned. Thanks.

            When I hear the media presenting Kamala as smart and accomplished, I feel like I’m drunk, have the spins, and am about to puke.
I haven’t felt it this bad since Obama first won and every magazine in the checkout aisle told me that Big Mike was the most beautiful woman who had ever lived.

                        Well said. Nietzsche, no Bible-thumper himself*, often uses the term “transvaluation” or “revaluation” of all values. Maybe not always an inversion, but sometimes so, as in the “slave” morality which was a deliberate antithesis of the Master’s moral system.
*He wryly calls himself “the timely advocate of the Devil, or to employ theological terms, an enemy and challenger of God.” [from memory]

        I was just watching a video on YT about a study where scientists transplanted poop from young mice into old mice and it reversed cognitive decline in the old mice. It got me thinking – why didn’t they try this with Biden? They could have found a young donor somewhere in the dungeons of Yale and push his donation into Biden to keep him going for another few years. Instead, they are now stuck with an actual poop as a candidate.

            “Reverse” is a word that indicates movement in the opposite direction something was originally traveling. Cognitive decline is the used to describe meadurable loss of cognitive abilities. “Loss”, as in “gone”, as in “gone forever”, as in “that which cannot be recovered”. Once it’s gone, it’s gone.

                That is not entirely true. As an example, certain metal poisoning (like bismuth, for ex), causes cognitive decline over time and if misdiagnosed, is fatal. But if diagnosed correctly and treated quickly, it can be fully reversed.
With old people, you often don’t know what are the underlying causes behind their cognitive decline. The diagnosis is often just an educated guess. That’s one of the reasons why it’s difficult to treat, but also why some treatments, even exotic ones, may sometimes work.

        I don’t know if anyone has mentioned this, but regarding the age of Serious Men, let’s give a reluctant shout out to George McGovern. He served on a B-24 in 35 missions over Europe; he was married to the same woman his whole adult life; he took his particular version of Christianity seriously (he considered a career in ministry); he never got rich off politics, any more than Carter or Truman; he lived to be 90 on a vegetarian diet.
Horrid politics, but a serious and decent man for all that.

            I didn’t know he was a vegetarian, but it fits: McGovern, via a series of hearings his committee held, was a major force in the official demonizaton of fats (on, at best, inconclusive evidence) and the promotion of a (supposedly) healthy diet by the late 1970s by USDA and other regulators. His actions, however well intended they may have been, can take at least partial credit for the dramatic increase in rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes and perhaps other maladies since 1980.

                        Right about Hitler and the Nazis in general. In many of their cultural practices and views they were indistinguishable from the postmodern Left. And a certain Leftist circle loves it when I point that out.
PS–Porphiry, a neoplatonist philosopher from the 3rd century AD was a vegetarian. He is the earliest noteworthy person in the West I’m aware of who was a vegetarian.

        Last add, I note that the US has again bombed Yemen on Wed. Operation Prosperity Guardian has been totally ineffective against the Houthis.Meanwhile, after Hootie and the Blowfish launched a drone that hit Tel Aviv, the Israelis struck back hard and effectively. Using Italian air tankers, the Israeli Air Force covered 1,000 miles to the target, and took out: an oil refinery and storage tanks, and port cranes.This was effective as drones need fuel, and the drones and missiles don’t sprout from Yemen’s ground, but have to be shipped in from Iran. As is most of their food. Now Yemen will start to experience hunger and famine (there are not many ports) and fuel and more drone shipments are going to be very, very difficult. It is not “war ending” but it is very effective in degrading Yemen’s offensive capacities.Why was Israel more militarily effective the the US?They had freedom to come up with various plans that would not be vetoed by a huge and sluggish bureaucracy. They were not concerned about “optics” but deterrence. They did not have girl bosses or fabulous hair dressers interfering. They did not have woke as their principal objective.The relative failure/success rate of the US vs. Israel regarding Yemen bodes ill for our guaranteed attempts to defeat both Russia and China abroad and at home [Note that both Russia and China flew over part of Alaska recently with various bombers and Chinese ships conducted “training missions” around the Aleutians.]

            Yes, being a genocidal ethnicity that thinks it’s God’s Chosen people allows you streamline your operations and not concern yourself with collateral damage.  What’s odd is that this same ethnicity is at the forefront of these societal changes that plague our military and every other institution in the USA.

        We have a corporate stooge for a senator too (well, maybe that’s all of them at this point) and they’re basically single issue voters who are allowed to vote for all manner of horrible, nation destroy policies, so long as the business lobby sponsoring them gets their “slice”.  I know I remarked before about a part-time state rep in our area that I guess is the niece of some local plutocrat who wanted his own stooge in the statehouse to handle his business so the rot goes pretty deep.An aside too, time was, before Obama, that Senators were strongly frowned on to be President with the thinking that Governors were much better for the role, both from a managerial and campaign standpoint.  But now the executive office is stuffed with Senators, with my guess being that they combine name recognition with a strong loyalty to the regime in D.C.

        The fakeness and the gayness, two sides of the same coin, are part and parcel of the switch in power from elected officials and their parties, to unelected, semi-hereditary bureaucrats.Kafka understood this well, so did Solzhenitsyn, so too Luis Borges, and other Latin American writers. Things were very fake and gay in Latin America long before they became fake and gay here. Indeed you can look back at Don Henley videos and songs from the 1980s, ostensibly aimed at Reagan, and switch them to Biden or Kamala. The real power does not even lie in Parties that compete for votes, but the people who run various government agencies who cannot be removed and replaced by followers of various parties.That means that voting has no effect whatsoever on policy. Why would it? The people who run the FBI, or CIA, or EPA, or FDA, or NIH, don’t answer to anyone but the corporate masters who offer them “consultancies” after they retire, or revolving doors from corporate to government bureaucracies. Its not just the Pentagon that does this — its every one.This is why Trump is such a threat. He was not selected by the permanent bureaucracies living inside the CIA or FBI or what have you. His deep/broad connection, particularly to those at the bottom of the hierarchies: straight White males, is a threat to the effeminate, soft, squishy dudes like Christopher Wray, or Peter Strozhk, or the various girl-bosses like Kim Cheatle. Who do NOT inspire loyalty, or posses even an ounce of charisma and presence.It is also why things seem so crazy and are crazy. The people with real power thought it was a good idea to flood DC with Hamas supporters cursing the US and burning the US flag during Bibi’s visit, defacing every monument and chasing away the cops. This suggests that while they have a stranglehold over government, there is active and ongoing personal and collective resistance to the fake/gay fantasies of the soft, passive-aggressive Wrays, Strozhks, and Cheatles. This dominance display was aimed at various Congressmen and Senators who might think of jumping on the Trump Train that the Hamas paid people are even scarier and with even less a leash than anti-Fa.I also think there are no limits as to what they can and will do, up to and including: A. a massive draft, B. More Hamas riots and purges aimed at Normies, C. “Special Managing” of elections or even canceling them “to save Democracy”, D. Imposition of a White tax for Reparations, E. Seizure of homes of White people for “newcomers”, F. Mass arrests of “threats to Democracy” including not just Trump but most if not all of the Republican Party, registered Republicans, and likely supporters.Their power is absolute, within their bureaucracies and government, and it corrupts absolutely.

            I don’t think Trump is much of a threat.  He has no ability to remove the real entrenched power brokers.  And his supporters have no organized answer to to the antifa and blm democrat terrorist mobs who can be activated to burn down the country.

            I have said this before, as have others. We are a conquered people and we’d better adapt, fast, to the whims and requirements of our masters. That said, we can “work to rule” which means they are fucked. These are not the grizzled veterans of banishment to Siberia under the Czar, or the hardy survivors of Mao’s “Long March”. They are pampered, narcissistic, soulless automatons. They can storm a building, but they don’t bring their lunch.Our motto should be “we listen and obey”. It sounds crazy, but imagine, these fuckers having no enemy to attack, only compliant servants – working to rule, mark you – as all systems of civilized life break down.Addendum: Think of the English, my people. Despite Roman rule for more than three centuries, they did not adopt Latin as their tongue, as happened in Gaul, Spain, Dacia, and elsewhere. After 1066 they did not become speakers of Norman French; their language survived – it was Norman royalty that learned to speak the language of their “conquered” people.Recently I checked out a random couple of sentences I started the day with, with my wife… and my dog. For whatever reason I wrote down what I had said, and looked at the etymology of every word used. Out of 38 words, 29 were directly anglo-saxon, and four others were from old Danish, creeping into our lingo from the Danelaw period,My point: The enemy is ascendant, and we cannot beat them politically at this time. But we can hunker down and carry our culture into the future.

        “What we are seeing now is the approach to peak fakeness, which most likely comes just before collapse.”I’m not so sure, I could see some cataclysmic event happening due to israel because they’re crazy enough to provoke such a thing but a plain jane collapse? I feel like some how some way this will just keep going &amp; getting more clowned out while also just decaying.I don’t even know what a collapse would look like given the fact that so much of the population falls into either the full blown savage supremacist camp or genuinely believes MLK’s dream is just right around the corner if we just tell brown people how great freedom is.A while back David Cole of all people really elucidated the point when he quoted several prominent GOP figures who wanted secession &amp; also quoted their utterly fantastical views about race. There’s not one person in the mainstream who doesn’t utterly fail to recognize the racial elephant in the room, secession would at best be moving the clock backwards to repeat everything that’s happened all over again.I suspect any sort of collapse would end up similar to Russia where we get our own Putin figure who will continue to ethnically cleanse Whites but now with a bible in his hand. It’d be an improvement to be sure but there’s no amount of religion that can offset the despair &amp; hopelessness of being a racial alien in a decaying &amp; corrupt country.

        Just heard the show, a good one. Yes everything really is fake and gay. Even though my occasional normalcy bias acts up a little sometimes. There are no golden solutions in a show like this but it is still nice to hear others express the same kinds of thoughts I share with a few friends in meat space. We are the sane minority!!! The universe and reality don’t give a [deleted] about their [again deleted, I am getting so mellow] regime.Really sorry about VDare. Good people on our side. Hopefully they’ll still be part of the dissident environment going forward.And btw, the author of the paper End of Empire and the search for survival is called John Glubb. Very important paper, like 18 or so pages. Well worth your time!

        Good shout out about Meerloo’s “Rape of the Mind” book.
He released it at the height of the Covid madness.  Lockdowns, mandatory vaccines, people losing their jobs, etc.
We call it “gaslighting” now, and it’s on a whole other level.
Beginning to think that Twitter (now stupidly known as X) is a huge part of the problem and not the place to find “the real story”.

        Now here we have Harris who is nothing but a cackle and pantsuit. She is the DEI version of Hilary, which means a cheap replica of the real thing, but in brown.You’re being too generous on the optics, imho. This is important since everything fake and gay is, well, manufactured and astroturfed, AKA marketed to influence us.Fashionably, something doesn’t work with her style, and really not the pantsuits. At first I thought maybe it was just cheap ass clothing choices. I’m a gender-non-fluid male, so idk women’s clothing much, but I know suits. Her suit jackets look weird or poorly fit, especially in the shoulders (pads?). They look cheap even though they aren’t. I was surprised too to find so many articles written about her “amazing” fashion choices. See links. Now you’re going to say Hill-dawg isn’t a paragon of style, but that’s not exactly true. Look at the last link, especially the other women wearing the bright pantsuits. There’s some pop and pizzazz. You could argue softness but confidence and memorability without gauche. AOC does simple and looks presentable. Harris is described as “elegant” yet she reminds me more of that bland AirBNB style…what do they call it? Where everything looks exactly the same…bland, greyed out, etc. You don’t know whether you’re in Paris or Kentucky or bum-fuck-nowhere. Then you throw a gaudy throwback art piece on the wall to show you’re eclectic, local, and fun. (in this metaphor, her necklaces or her converse)https://theglossarymagazine.com/fashion/kamala-harris-trouser-suits/https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2024/07/23/kamala-harris-fashion/https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/lifestyle-buzz/kamala-harris-style-guide-how-the-vice-president-seamlessly-blends-authority-with-elegance/ss-BB1quvulhttps://www.vogue.com/slideshow/kamala-harris-style-retrospectivehttps://www.fastcompany.com/90397786/meet-the-womens-suit-startup-dressing-politicians-from-kamala-harris-to-hillary-clintonTurning to the cackle, not even this word describes what your ears hear. A teenager might chortle and a chicken might caw but this laugh is something else. Fran Drescher, who’s laugh issupposedto be annoying especially given her semi-attractiveness, is at least somewhat endearing in her piercing giggle. Harris laughs in a more of a forced, high-pitch cawing more akin to Jeb’s “please clap,” but way more annoying although just as cringe.On the polling, I haven’t looked so someone correct me if I’m wrong but I’d bet Hill-dawg polls better than Harris. At least with Hills, you know she’s crafty enough to know what the definitions of the word “is”… are? The memes about her being totally ruthless… sure we might not like her, but she might just glass our enemies over tea for the lolz. Harris fr has no redeeming qualities, again imho. I can’t think of one.Closing up on this comment, I usually have only been coming here to give Z a bit of a hard time, so can’t believe I wrote a textwall about these trivialities. [Insert conspiracy theory about Z here]. Hopefully for once someone gets something out of this comment.

        There has been a super-interesting article at Unz’s for a couple days: its subtitle is “And why the dollar isn’t going away”.
Of late it’s become a habit of our host to forecast the Cathedral’s fall (“collapse”); I don’t see that on the horizon; I see the $, and the $-issuers (in fact, owners of the money)not going away; as long as they don’t have budget bounds, they aren’t going to be unseated: neither within tge USA nor globally.

                And heads up guys, Litchfield, CT is not filled with poor Americans just struggling to make it day to day. It is indeed 99% white but it is also very wealthy. If the Brimleows don’t want to run VDARE, fair enough. If you’re on the brink with your own finances, I’m thinking that the Brimleows have access to other funds.

                    It is painful to read posts such as this because it reveals far more about you than it does about those of whom you write. As a once successful financial writer in New York City, PeterBrimelowmay well have lived, or had a business relationship with someone, in Connecticut. Having rented P.O. boxes in various locations, even abroad, let me assure you it was based on need and had absolutely nothing to do with income level. VDARE previously averaged about $300,000 annually in (voluntary) donations, which not only kept a top-ranked webzine up and running but paid a stable of writers who were unemployable in mainstream media—and may have helped support a family of five.But this is where things get dark. Why would anyone feel the need for concern trolling about a now defunct nonprofit run on a relative shoestring, when the people behind shakedown operations like BLM, the ADL and the SPLC take in hundreds of millions and enjoy far more lavish lifestyles? Please tell us you’re a paid influencer of one of these latter organizations, so we don’t wrongly assume you’re writing such posts merely because you hate yourself (or are so desperate for attention it comes to the same thing).

                        That’s lovely a defense. That said, people don’t keep a PO box in place that’s an annoying commute. It’s on the way to somewhere, as with PO boxes in your life. That’s my point and you should know that, if you have experience with them. Litchfield, CT is near no where, other than maybe near home for the Brimelows. It’s quite common for NYCers to have 2nd homes in CT.Beyond that, don’t really care. I read VDARE once or twice and wandered off. If you want to send large checks to a stranger who is openly quitting and taking VDARE with him, all power to you. Grifting can happen in any space. Quite often the nationalist space is so hungry for content it forgets that it can be target too.

                            Why are you even here? The SPLC “Hatewatch” site, besides  the usual doxing, is rife with accounts of the trivial amounts of money supposedly earned by White advocates. Go over there and enjoy yourself! Bottom line: they hate Whites and want us and our families to starve.
Afghan women used to go out after a battle and bayonet the wounded, much to the horror of the British. Yet they are your moral superiors. They bayonetted the enemy wounded. You bayonet your fallen friends, those who wished your survival. How could anyone, even a troll, be that pathetic?

                                I’m here because Z man is an excellent writer. The posts about VDARE are an off hand reaction with some specific knowledge from being an ex-tax professional at one point.My posts are taking negatives, something that I anticipated. “You may have fooled” is no way to win friends.If we were not talking about VDARE, the statements about the end of this organization and the couple I’ve seen to date would have me hunting around for an early life section.I don’t care if the Brimlows are wealthy, more power to them. However, if someone really can’t afford to send money, then a heads up might be welcome. I’m trying to in small way prevent poor Whites from being poorer. It’s not like they’ve said they’re going to continue, so there’s nothing to lose here.

Also, there is a fundraiser as well as a petition for the Sam Melia, a UK political prisoner. He and his family just learned that he’ll be serving the entire sentence. His wife Laura Towler makes fantastic tea. Grandma Towler’s tea is delicious.

                I hate to be this skeptical, but the supposed inability of VDARE to move a non-profit organization has proved a fundraising boon.
Y’all are welcome to downvote this thought, but from afar, the most likely explanation of what is not a difficult task legally is that the Brimloews are done running VDARE and would not be upset with some additional retirement funds.

                    Wiffle: I agree regarding the VDARE effort at this point. They charged an arm and a leg for their final conference.They are a wonderful family, though,  and have done good work for many years. It would be great if they could host many dissident events at the castle in the future.

                    Both of these things can be true. VDare was moved out of NY long ago but Letitia James claims some kind of jurisdiction because it was once incorporated there.

                        A DA claim jurisdiction all they want. If they don’t have it, then they don’t. If the entity was properly closed years ago then that’s end of the discussion. There’s no standing in NY and none of the state’s business. I can only think of possible residency complications/hassles from the equivalent of the tax agencies.If anything, a fact of VDARE’s incorporation in CT  makes this whole thing seem worse. Do we have any outside verification of what was spent on lawyer fees?

                            I am not saying you’re wrong. I simply don’t know enough about VDare to really know. I read them from time to time. However, lawfare and crazy, ideological judges and DAs are a real thing. You seem to assume that “if tre law says X it must be X”. That’s a good idea for civics class. It is sadly not the real world. Crazy lawfare is terribly real. Trump was convicted of a made up crime, then threatened with possible jail. The suddenly oh, never mind said the immigrant judge. Not having looked at the VDare case myself except what they say on the site and what Z and a few others say, I was simply assuming they were at the business end of similar harassment lawfare

                                            In asking if the Brimlows might be part of the establishment, I advocate for the sincere and the poor in nationalist circles. Again, any sincere belief will attract people looking to cash in, regardless of that belief. Those people who ultimately cash in may even started out sincere, but they don’t always end that way.And what have they done in reality? If I may get into a generational observation, they ran a webzine from the comfort of their home and along some conferences for decades. At 76, they are now shutting down, claiming it’s all someone’s else’s fault they can’t continue, but please send money anyway. A popular and well loved webzine is not being handed off to the next generation, but shut down and their marbles taken home while they cry victim with their hand out in an incoherent manner. Ok, particular generation here.There is no man more hated possibly all of the West than Donald Trump at this moment. He can find lawyers and accountants who will help him. If I have only vaguely heard of them, I guarantee you that there are people who will help them out there because they have never heard of them.Do I destroy the future of VDARE by suggesting that their story doesn’t add up? It’s already done. It’s not like my comments have widespread readership either. I would have said less than I have except for this odd need to not consider the point.

                                I agree we live in a lawfare crazy world. However, that does not mean I need to trust unverified statements from people, just because they may agree with my views while hinting around at the existence of lawfare. As I stated in different post, I was a tax pro at one point. People are not honest when it comes to money. These statements sound like the rationalizations I’ve heard before.It would not be big deal except they are obviously actively asking for cash AFTER they’ve said they are closing and taking VDARE with them.My posts are going to do very little honestly anyway. They clearly very popular in certain circles. If you think it a good idea and you have the funds, then by all means do what you think best.

                        Claiming jurisdiction is one thing, actual standing is another. If the entity was properly closed years ago then that’s end of the discussion. I can only think of possible residency complications/hassles from the equivalent of the NY tax agencies as even a real claim.If anything, a possible fact of VDARE’s incorporation in CT makes this whole thing seem worse. 🙁

This goes to support Laura, a mom of two young daughters, the baby born while Sam, the family breadwinner, serves a 2-year prison sentence in the UK. He has been known to share a portion of this fund with other, less well-known activists likewise incarcerated there for speech crimes.

Laura is a full-time volunteer with Patriotic Alternative, an organization dedicated (ironically) to the well-being of Native Britons. Profits from Laura Towler’s tea and coffee go to support those efforts. They cooperate with a U.S. entity to cut down on shipping costs stateside.

        Hey, Z.I wouldn’t want all or most of your best content to be behind the dollar door; however, I decided to essay it date ago and was disappointed by it being consistently pretty lower quality than the free one.Seems unfair and it is not easy to see the motivation for such a content allottment.Cheers.
