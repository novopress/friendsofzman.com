        As we’re moving closer to acknowledging the massive mistake in importing the Third World into White countries, it’s becoming illegal to acknowledge (((who))) had a major role in it.

            I think piling on the Irish at this point is a mistake.

                Saw someone gloating online this morning about an Irish MMA fighter who shouted “Free Palestine” while beating on an Israeli during a fight.
Why wasn’t this Paddy shouting “Free Ireland”?  It behooves the Chosens to have goyim fixate on the Middle East, even if they take the side of the Palestinians, as it keeps them distracted from the ongoing replacement in their own lands.

                    The Irish people have always been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause because they understand that the indigenous Christians in the Holy Land are for the most part on the Palestinian side. Those indigenous Christians are mostly Eastern Orthodox or Eastern Catholics and I believe that’s where the sympathy comes from. Irish, in a way, sympathetic to the plight of their Catholic brethren.

                        Or…it could be that Irish nationalism is a creature of the Left and that the Irish are allowed to act out according to the precepts of Leftist BS.
You can trash Americans, the English and the Scots, and rail against Israeli colonialism.

                            Maybe it’s just that part of their country is occupied, at least according to their sentiments. They sympathize with other Catholics that are also under occupation.

                        I believe the Irish are less concerned with the Palestinians’ respective religions than they are with the fact that the Palestinians are an colonialist-occupied country much as Ireland was for six centuries, fighting a massive empire to gain their freedom from it.

                        The only country in the Middle East where Christian population keeps growing is Israel.Christians in the Palestinian ruled territories criticize Israel because they know what will happen to them and their families if they don’t.

                            Presumably you are referring to the backing Israel and her American acolytes give to Islamic entities which upon gaining power immediately massacre the Christians who have existed in the Near East since the time of Christ (long before your East European ancestors settled there!) Or perhaps you are referring to the Israeli arms and know-how the Azeris used to expel the Christians from Nagorno-Karabakh. And we mustn’t forget the Gaza churches the IDF deliberately bombed to kill the Christians who had sought sanctuary there. Such examples are more immediately effective than the spitting on Christians in public places, dispossession from their property, and otherimmiserationpracticed by Jews in Israel proper. But, to be frank, I am more bothered by the replacement of Europeans pushed by your people in our own homelands. Suppose you addressthat, since your current attempt at dishing out the goy-slop are totally lost on me.

                            Anyone who has met an Arab Christian or been to an Arab Church in Palestine OR anywhere else knows what Christians who actually encounter Israel think of it.  I assure you they say exactly the same when they have no relatives left anywhere in the region.  Do you think constantly corrupting a bigger nation to attack defenseless people endears anyone to you?The only Christians who have anything nice to say about you are the deep southern evangelical kind who actually have never even MET you.  Average arab christian spits on the ground with the same vehemence of a muslim.  For that matter the same vehemence of those of us in the west who know what you’re up to HERE.

                        During the late 1970’s up until the accords of the 1990’s the IRA trained alongside the PLO. I’m sure that is one of the reasons for their support.

            But the (((who))) are the ones turning against it. The more sensible ones realize that importing infinity immigrants means importing infinity people that are either indifferent or hostile to Zion.
But I blame my fellow whites more than anything. They got outmaneuvered, brainwashed, and bamboozled. Like Derb says, they could always have just said “no” or remembered their f**king backbone.

                It’s like the discussion I had with somebody here the other day about the fact that the new Muslim girl in their rural community is better looking than the obese tatted up white trash you typically see there. Whites have gotten sloppy and undisciplined in each and every way.

                    Is it worth noting that in many traditional Muslim (and not only Muslim) societies, a woman who even shows interest in the infidels will at the least be badly beaten, at worst killed? And similar treatment may await her would-be suitor. While to some extent some of these immigrants assimilate, that’s far from universal. De-facto Sharia law occurs in Europe and sometimes even here in North America.

                        And how do you propose to show this “strength” in our corporate over policed world?  I get what you’re saying, but their is only one “man” in the life of the majority of white womens lives these days.  His name is Uncle Sam, and he makes the deadbeat who knocked you up pay, and he makes the companies give you preferential treatment, and he makes sure you have access to any area you feel your presence is needed.

                This. I have come across several books which can serve as markers for the different stages of Jewish conquest of America. Henry Ford’s 4-volume “The International Jew” (1919-21) [an astonishing document] can be summarized as having two main themes. First, it is a plea to Jews “We know how it was and is in Europe, your old patterns don’t have to be repeated here. Assimilate and become Americans and everything will work out great for you.” Second, it was a warning to the then WASP merchant ruling class: “You better start paying attention! If we don’t make sure these Jews assimilate we are going to have serious problems!” This was at the beginning of the Roaring 20’s so I think it is fair to encapsulate WASP merchant response as “Henry, shut up with all this doom and gloom! Can’t you see that we’re making money here? We’re not Ford rich yet, but we’re gonna be!”Fast forward to 1951 and the publication of John Beaty’s (colonel army intelligence) “The Iron Curtain Over America.” I summarize his message as “Guys, we are getting conquered! Wake up!” Only one publisher was willing to take a risk on this book, which eventually was a great success with many editions. Jews didn’t have the amount of control over publishing (a key control node for complex information distribution in the pre-internet era) that they later achieved, but like banking in Italy, even that far back the goys who work in that industry were already well-habituated to not cross Jewish interests.Joseph Bendersky’s “The Jewish Threat: Anti-Semitic Politics of the US Army” published in 2000 is a history of the US army intelligence resistance from the Jewish perspective. He spent 10 years researching it and it is a treasure trove of our ancestor’s noticing and resistance. Of course, from the perspective of Bendersky’s and those who backed his research, the crime was the noticing followed by active self-defense, not the genocidal destruction of European civilization which has occurred because they failed. Note that the bad behavior, and the response, LONG predates the Holocaust. The historical record is very clear on this. It would be simply nonsense to claim that their bad behavior is a response to the Holocaust.Years ago, I came across a transcript of a Senate subcommittee meeting (mid to late 1960’s, don’t remember the exact year) where a bunch of WASP senators were basically bemoaning that they has lost control. Their language was guarded, but it was clear to me that they were referring to the money streams that guide political behaviors. Even while not fiat yet, currency was still instantiated, and possession of that capability a key control node of American civilization. I remember Fulbright was one of them. These retards were so greedy and arrogant that despite a half century of warnings, when the end of their control came they were actually surprised.Wilmot Robertson’s 1972 “The Dispossessed Majority” can be seen as a fellow noticing and marking the passing of the 1rst American Empire (WASPs) into the 2nd American Empire (Jews). My summary of his work: “We have been conquered, and you idiots are still asleep. We are so screwed.”The old WASP ruling class was subordinated into a mere administrative class, and they were ‘grandfathered’. The Ivy League training grounds for the American ruling class were already being conquered and each successive year cohort became genetically and memetically less WASP. So they were replaced piecemeal, those already in the system being allowed to continue to feed at the troughs of money, as long as they did not challenge the system reset, and accepted or ignored the reality that their genetic descendants would never rule, but might be allowed to be well-remunerated servants of the new ruling class.Misanthropes make terrible governors of multi-ethnic societies, so inevitably Jews have ruled very badly and their entire imperial project (that they conquered from the WASPs and repurposed) is coming apart. The Trump movement at the donor level (which is the only level that matters until things go kinetic) is an attempt to keep the project from collapse. They are failing and will continue to fail.Any repair process or post-collapse instantiation of new polities that includes Jews is doomed to failure. Any changes they make are tactical and superficial. Their perception of others thatfundamentallyunderlies their bad behavior is not to change. It’s great they see the necessity of remigration, because they need to be part of it. Israel wants and needs them, and we do not.However, this is a necessary but sufficient condition. “[Our] fellow whites … got outmaneuvered, brainwashed, and bamboozled” because they were honorless merchants who were inadequately ethnocentric. Any replacement ruling class must be self-consciously structured to avoid their mistakes.

            There’s no doubt that the reaction to Oct. 7 and the Israelis response is part of this change in attitude among our elite. Jews realized that they were on Team Whitey/Oppressor whether they liked it or not. They brown horde hates them.
Maybe, just maybe, it’s not a great idea to flood the West – which is really the only place for Jews to live – with tens of millions of people who hate Jews and Israel. A lot of rich Jews are finally waking up to this reality.

WASPs had the ability to make things happen in the past, but they don’t seem to have the ability to do anything anymore other than push war on hapless third world countries and perform sodomite marriages in their mainline Protestant churches.
If Jews finally realize this, they’re in a position to make things happen.

        JP Morgan Chase/Jamie Dimon have correctly concluded that they cannot make any money lending to deadbeat, savage immigrants, so now they are against more immigration. Since Chase doesn’t own remittance wires (like Moneygram or Western Union) and has probably lost billions on immigrant credit card fraud, it’s time to clamp down. I imagine having the JPM HQ one block from the Roosevelt Hotel (packed with Biden’s “refugees” for several years) was a real practical education. You cannot be too cynical about this issue.

            If the “we have had too much immigration” belief had become widespread among oligarchs I would expect there would be much less resistance to it in the courts. Especially from John Roberts who acts as a weather vane to enforce elite consensus to the best of his ability.  The fact that deportations have been resisted to the degree they have been makes me think Dimon is a rogue.

                That belief needs to become widespread, else the “we have too many oligarchs” (or, at least, the wrong kind of oligarchs) belief will take its place.
Society will always have an elite. Whether the elite loves or hates the regular people of the nation is the big issue.

                    The people who already have all the money don’t “love” money. They just don’t want you to have any. There is only hatred.If there is anti-immigration sentiment among them—and thereisn’t, but let’s pretend—it’s been converted into anti-antisemitism. After Trump, that weapon he drops will not be used against favored groups.(Actually I expect Trump to get suckered into coming afterus, and for it to escalate greatly under President Vance or President AOC, who are the same person.)This may seem unrelated, but it isn’t: I recently saw Japanese TV frame America’s current attention on “foreign students” as a mad paroxysm of anti-Asian racism. They used the British meaning of “Asian” that’s foreign to us, and to the Japanese, the one that includes Indians and Middle Easterners. Strikingly odd.Why lie so strangely? For the next war.Remember, “we” fund their news.

            I walked by the Roosevelt Hotel last year – where I have fond memories of staying when I was younger – and being absolutely shocked by what I saw. It was absolutely third world. Actually even that is being harsh to the third world as most of it is much more civilized and dignified than the scene I witnessed.. It’s insane that our elites let things get to this point and shows just how much they hate us, they are willing to torch a crown jewel city of the empire just to rub it in our face.

                I have some experience in the 3rd world gained during my unwittingly ignoble and poorly rewarded imperial service. The conception thateverythingis shit is simply not true. There are always pockets of ‘nice’ where the rich live, even if they have to import almost everything.So you are absolutely spot-on to point out the significance of ‘our’ elites “[torching] a crown jewel city of [their] empire”. They literally hate us so much that they import barbarians to shit in their own habitat, just because it used to be the habitat of our now destroyed WASP ruling class. This is not the behavior of conquerors, but of raiders who sack and raze.This distinction is perhaps one of the fault lines underlying the civil war amongst the International Jews which is raging through their goy proxies all over the West. Those who wish to be conquerors and exploiters have had enough of the behavior of those who wish to sack and raze. The problem the former have is that they need goyish cooperation to challenge the latter, and goyim capable enough to defeat the sacker/razers simply cannot be trusted not to make a play for sovereignty and freedom from them all.

                Used to stay at the Roosevelt Hotel regularly in the course of work travel.
It’s not a “modern” hotel by any means, but for a 100 year old hotel in a walkable part of NYC, it was fine.
I was shocked to hear it was taken over by trashy “refugees”.
So sad.
Then again, NYC is completely down with doing this to YOUR neighborhood.
F ’em.  A billion immigrants for NYC, but they can never leave it.

            “and has probably lost billions on immigrant credit card fraud”I participated in a fraud seminar that had FBI, DEA and local police officers speaking about the types of fraud that exploded during Biden’s reign.  We’re talking good old fashioned check fraud, debit/credit card fraud, ACH/Zelle, card skimming at gas stations, ect.  Basically it’s foreigners coming to the country illegally and then working with their outlaws back home (dark web/telegram) to defraud Americans.  It’s not just Indians scamming boomers.  The most fascinating aspect was the nonchalance in which they addressed the issue.  They we’re resigned to the fact that even if they caught them, they would get away because the courts would give the fraudster a date in the future with no enforcement preventing them from fleeing.  The fraud boom was likely made way worse by Biden’s open border policy.  It’s a little early to tell for sure, but from what I’m seeing, fraud has gone down since Trump was elected.  Truly remarkable the bullshit we put up with in this country.

        I think the oligarchs realized that Cloward-Piven is a dreadful idea and will likely result in a French Revolutionesque terror that might involve their necks being placed in a guillotine.It is galling to see the constant stream of lies from the open borders crowd on how endless immigration boosts the economy, which is a literal god these deviants worship. Of course it’s a lie because most of them come here to pick the desiccated husk of our once-great nation on the dole.It is nice to see normies realize that dumping infinite numbers of low-IQ, incompatible and criminally-minded foreignersis a very bad ideabecause Somalis, Haitians or Guatemalans will most likely turn your neighborhood into a war zone and bring their weird customs and grievances to your front door step.In one way, the Biden administration’s goal to “resettle” migrants in middle America might’ve been a blessing in disguise, as showing small town residents the blessings of diversity might’ve swayed their opinion on the topic.I just wonder if this realization is too late.

Let’s not ignore the fact that dumping high numbers of mid- and high-IQ incompatible and in-group-preferring foreigners is also a very bad idea.

                    You cannot get them to “assimilate.”  They are not us and do not act or think like us.  The most you can expect from them is they won’t have high violent crime rates.  But that’s just violent crime.  Fraud, identity theft and other white collar crimes are common among these groups.  Anyone who thinks high IQ people can fit right in and become one of us only need look at Jews and Japanese.  They are not us.

        Have the elites really decided they don’t like the country being flooded with third worlders, or have they sensed the normies have noticed and decided to pretend to shut it down?

                The need to reconfigure the global economy means the US will need to start paying its own way again. Reducing the trade deficit means reducing the huge flow of dollars into US asset markets, particularly treasury bonds. Someone will need to pick up that slack.

                    One of the great bits of psychological warfare on the American people is that government debt is what has made middle-class life possible. Therefore, any reforms that shrink the state must come out of the pockets of the white middle-class. In reality, the massive debt is used to finance the oligarchs. If we simply eliminated the top five percent of wealthy people, the books could easily be balanced and order restored.

                Instead of boosting the economy, more nonwhite bodies has drained the economy.  Instead of being the solution, nonwhite immigration is the problem itself.The idea of more strong backs is based on 18th century economics, when more strong backs in a labor-short, empty land were needed.Economically, what broke the Islamic empires were Columbus’ discovery of the New World, and Vasco de Gama’s charting of a route around the Horn of Africa.  The Silk Roads to the East saw their revenues slip, and slip, as the Muslims had no blue-water navies.  Their Golden Age could no longer fund its great universities.  Even slavery were not profit enough.

                    Alzaebo:“more nonwhite bodies“
The purpose of “more nonwhite bodies” was to destroy Christianity and the White race in the United States.
That’s why the j00, Emanuel Celler, gifted us with the 1965 immigration act: to destroy Christianity and the White race.

                The only “economic benefit” the immigrants were supposed to bring was that they would be willing to do menial labor for substandard wages, remain submissive, and keep their mouths shut — unlike the white working class, which had the effrontery to think they actually had “rights” and demanded decent wages, safe work conditions, and time off to enjoy life.

            There’s two issues here. One is that the elites are terrified that the next generation of elites is immune to hasbara, hence they are cracking down on the elite factories like Harvard. The other is that they flooded the country with millions of people who have no business being here and it is not just destroying the society but leading to a mass “checking out” of the productive people in society. As for how they feel about both, see that Trump’s admin has gone ballistic on Harvard and Columbia while deportations are underwhelming at best (at least the border is closed). The elite factory crackdown has also gotten minimal judicial pushback (to the point where Harvard is starting to realize that they are basically screwed as long as Trump wants to go after them) while every move Trump has made towards mass deportations has been stymied, even if temporarily.

That is Bill Maher. His snark should never entertain only further fuel that internal fire that wants to vanquish all foes that seek our eternal demise.

                Mycale, I’ve read your poast a couple of times now, and I can’t make heads nor tails of it, but it feels like you might have a good idea [or a good observation] in there somewhere.

                    Elites are very concerned about the next generation of elites not giving a hoot about Israel (or being hostile to it). Hence Trump’s crackdown on Harvard, Columbia, et. al. Harvard has tried to sue the Trump admin but not gotten very far.
Elites don’t really care about the broad mass of immigration (or actually like it). Hence Trump’s underwhelming deportation numbers, and the total judicial opposition to any policy Trump implements to try to get rid of people.
Both problems are “immigration” related but seem to be going in two different directions.

        I am starting to wonder if Jamie Dimon has gone rogue from his social circle. He is nearing the end of his time at JP Morgan and he may want to lay down some statements as markers to make it look like he was one of the sane ones.  Dimon may understand the cake is already baked and knows the collapse can’t be stopped.  The risk to him personally is so low now he feels comfortable speaking up to the press.

            For more than a few years I’ve thought of Dimon as, “the good bad guy.”
This is because he seems more partial to the US. He had this attitude well in advance of Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos, etc.
I think Dimon takes a lot of pride in leading the House of Morgan and is keenly aware its fortunes are intertwined with the trajectory of the US.

        America was settled by different groups of people, with different beliefs, in distinct areas of the country…New England and much of the South and Tidewater areas have little in common…So they fought a civil war…The whole American project is going to work better when it breaks up into more cohesive countries….Which Armstrong’s AI predicts will begin in 2033…

            But once again, countries west of the Hajnal line, between manorial feudalism in England, France, etc. and those areas, like Southern Italy and the Balkans, where kin group allegiance dominated, explains much of the problem…The US was founded by the former group, but most of the new emigrants are from kin group societies that are alien to the “melting pot” theory of nationalism…

        “Every day the window on the issue seems to move from the long-held position of open borders to what is now called remigration, the return of migrants to their homelands.”The concept of remigration only address half the problem.  What of those who are not recent immigrants?  What of those who were granted citizenship by our benighted citizenry in the past and have now form subversive clusters (ghettos) within the polis? What of those who are “native”, but not of the “asabiyyah”?What is needed to address the other half of the problem is “exile”.  Beforeasabiyyahthere was the exile.  Malcontents were driven from the polis to far off lands (who cares where, just not here)!  So we need such today for our native malcontents (Spiteful Mutants).  Prisons are not the answer for such malcontents.  They need to go somewhere else and found their own polis.Good luck….

Those subcons and east asians and mestizos and haitians who began arriving in the late ’60s and 1970s have now spawned 3-4 generations that the average White has been conditioned to consider ‘natural-born’ citizens.

                    You misunderstand me.  When Whites have a family member raped or killed by nonwhites, they decry ‘racism’ before their loved one’s body is cold.  It teaches them nothing but how to grovel further.  I’m speaking of death of the nonwhites and their (w)hite enablers, and destruction of AINO and the anti-White order.

                Remigration cannot occur strictly through “capture and deport”.  Remigration success will depend on voluntary deportation.  To do this, we must “sour the milk”.  Until we see “illegals” having no access to employment or welfare, we will never see success in significantly reducing their numbers.
Current deportation efforts are fine to create uncertainty In those here illegally that they will never become citizens via their entry route and must return home, but it can never be an end in itself—there are just too many already here who are too imbedded to ferret out.

        “We aren’t machines. Our ability to tolerate difference has limits. The more strongly we disapprove of something, the harder it is for us to tolerate it. That’s why tolerance requires at least some common ground, some shared beliefs, shared loyalty, or shared commitment to the common good. In his 1993 bookPolitical Liberalism, the Harvard philosopher John Rawls wondered:‘How is it possible for there to exist over time a just and stable society of free and equal citizens, who remain profoundly divided by reasonable religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines?’And Rawls concluded:‘In fact, historical experience suggests that it rarely is.&#x27;”

            That’s the weak point, the idea that everybody wants to be “a just and stable society of free and equal citizens,”like white Europeans who readily intermarry.Case in point, Rhodesia and South Africa. On the white side, we have Ingsoc, Orwell’s Oligarchical Socialism, wherein Crown or City Kapitalists install communism to keep the resources cheap and labor costs low. Oppenheimer deBeers, granted special charter by the Crown, pays off its communist satraps in the ANC by way of mining contracts, business concessions, and government contracts.As the South Africans say, “wealth goes out, poverty stays in,” along the lines of the Tudor model the American colonies rebelled against- that of raw materials out, manufactured goods in. The workers remain consumers, same results as the communist model, unable to capitalize on their own resources.More to your point, was the nature of African society. The African order is a contest of which tribe dominates; they each feel entitled to rape the nation for their tribe’s benefit.Rhodesia and South Africa were successful societies as long as Bwana White Man was the uncontested king tribe; the majority of Africans lived on tribal trust lands, uninterested in schools or hospitals as those were only portals to the white world.They neither understood nor cared about “democracy”, only that they could live undisturbed in their traditional ways, since Bwana King would keep their neighbors from raiding. They understand chiefs, but sharing power with another tribe is incomprehensible.Mandela, a minor princeling of the mad Xhosa, angry at the Zulu for enslaving his people, went to the Communists to see if he could win a Swaziland of his own. The Communists, like their brethren in London’s City, saw the same opportunity they had with Mugabe and Ken Kaunda: Crown Ingsoc, Oligarchical Socialism, was installed in both Rhodesia and South Africa under the veneer of “democracy”- the right for a voting majority to conquer the losing side and loot at will.Meanwhile, the tribes war on as gangs, unable to maintain a country they never built.

            I’m surprised to see Rawls had a streak of sanity. However, he omitted one of the key problems of diversity–aesthetics. Normal people much prefer the physical appearance–including garb, hair styles, jewelry, etc.–of their own kind, and become angry or despondent when they instead encounter large numbers of people who look very different. Simultaneously, there is deprivation of the primordial aesthetic embedded in every person’s psyche, and the insinuation of an alien aesthetic. The result is psychological conflict and turmoil, which, if unremitting and widespread, will generate social upheaval.

        “The 14th-century Arab historian and sociologist Ibn Khaldun wrote about this thing he calledasabiyyah,which is something like social cohesion or group solidarity. It is the natural desire to cooperate that arises from family and the tribe, which allows for the construction of increasingly complex social structures.”Survival necessitates cooperation among the clan and tribe. Ibn Khaldun uses the example of the Bedouins. I think you’ve summed up the rest of his cyclic theory of history well, but you should mention that it’s not just the assimilation of new people that weakens the asabiyyah but also the life of luxury. Hardship breeds cooperation, trust, a “group soul.” Without that group spirit things start falling apart, first slowly and then with increasing momentum.Ibn Khaldun was an interesting fellow. I keep a copy of hisAl-Muqadimahon my shelf. He prefigured much of the thought of Spengler and Toynbee by centuries. His work will still be around centuries from now, when all this rubbish on post-modernism and cultural diversity has been consigned to the trash bin.With asabiyyah present in a tribal society, the naturally chosen leaders live among the people and have the same lifestyle. Genghis Khan did not live a life of ease and ostentation. This asabiyyah led to the Mongols conquering right up to Europe, just as earlier the desert Arabs successfully invaded the Persian and Byzantine empires.I know you’re a sci-fi reader so you probably know Ibn Khaldun influenced Frank Herbert’sDune, and the notion of Asabiyyah comes through in the recent movie adaptations of the novel as well. The Fremen are tribal people — scum in the minds of the Harkonnens.

        I would argue that a sick society cannot heal until it first rids itself of the disease-causing pathogens. The US and Europe have been intentionally flooded with 3rd World illegals for the purpose of destroying social cohesion and laying the groundwork for extreme civil violence when the gravy train stops running. Native plebs versus barbarian invaders in a mutual bloodbath; with the elites ensconced their hidey holes until the smoke clears. Why have they changed their tune?

        I have noticed a contrast recently. On one hand, you have governments that punish criminals to protect the innocent. On the other hand, you have governments that punish the innocent to protect criminals.“Humans rights” groups are constantly after Bukele for jailing all those criminals and making El Salvador safe for ordinary people for the first time in decades.Meanwhile the UK is jailing people who dare to complain about criminal gangs in their midst.The UK has chosen poorly.I don’t think the US had chosen yet. Many of our most influential urban areas are clearly trending toward the UK model, while other, Whiter areas want to emulate El Salvador.

            I just have to laugh. Crime stats for the UK and the US are freely available; the idea that the UK is as bad or worse than the US in terms of crime,especially violent crime, is risible.
Britain is not close to the US in terms of diversity, and in terms of crime and social dysfunction the US is truly exceptional.
There’s this weird thing with Americans,even dissidents, where you always assume that Europe is worse despite your lying eyes. Keep wishcasting.

                The UK is now officially only 70% White – far better than the US at 58%, but still falling fast.  Most of the major English cities are now 40% White.  You’ve reached the point of no return – just as we have – because Whites stopped having children and more than half of your schoolchildren are now hostile, alien, and brown.  That is something no politician can fix.  We’re all screwed – and I don’t say that to celebrate, but to mourn.

                I attribute some of the ignorant bliss to population density. Until only recently most Americans lived in ways that avoided crime and diversity. In the last decade or so they started to self-sort for “better schools” or whatever excuse. That’s good, mind you, but waking up before the invasion was near completion would have been better. I hope the UK sees the horror unfolding here and takes note. I’m not holding my breath, though. Our people have a suicide gene.

        I know some people are annoyed by Turchin’s Hari Seldon-esque approach to this, but it’s hard to read his work and not understand just how cooked we are. Our political culture is so degraded that it seems to take pride in our lack ofasabiyyahand sees it as a strength, hence the Obama-era cliche about diversity (which you don’t hear anymore).The Qatari-led project to purge our universities and ruling class of anyone who criticizes Israel is not going to work either, as White people are not going to sign up and die for Zion like they did in 2001-2002 no matter how many brown PhD students get shipped back to their home country. Once you loseasabiyyah, you do not get it back – Rome lost it sometime in the 400s and Southern Italy still is a basketcase.

            You’re right. This country will never form up any kind of asabiyyah as Z is imagining. There was a tiny, tiny approach to it in the 1940s and 50s — what we view now as a halcyon era of social cohesion — but it didn’t come close even then. People bought into the myth of national solidarity that was manufactured by the WASP and Jewish elites. But it was really a gaslighting operation of the entire population. Pre-1860s, we werecloserto Assabiyah in the South andcloserto Asabiya in New England than we’ve ever been before, but not really that close even then.If it happens sometime in the future, it will be hundreds of years away and only among a few groups occupying some small area. I read a book on assabiyah years back. Assabiyah is a cultural spirit that allows a cultural expansion by military conquest to take place. It is far deeper than the ideas of the enlightenment that once united this country. People will always remember the great empire of Murica and that might provide a rationale to reunite the continent at that time, but not under enlightenment standards.

        “The newasabiyyahwill grow out of the wreckage of the ideological society.”
I hope so but I fear the majority minority and their “Western” enablers may permanently wreck us before we get to asabiyyah.

        Some of the elite may be second guessing open borders but open borders has become a religious jihad for good whites in the management class and most of our replacements are not going to support major reimigration.Maybe in a year we will kick out 1 million of the 10 million who came in under Biden but that still leaves up to 58 million (no one really knows because it is racist to know) illegals in the US that aren’t going anywhere. Whites don’t have the stomach for what it would take to initiate massive deportations and judges won’t allow it.

            When tempted to imagine a split between the elite employer class (Randian protagonists) and its professional-class employee enforcers (Randian antagonists), I recommend a glance at the job titles of our famous “oligarchs.”
They’re management. Not one capitalist among them.

        Now that the “elites” are coming around to the position of cutting off immigration, the task of the “right” (not to be confused with the “conservatives”) is to push them from there to mass deportation. They’ve already been pushed this far, so it’s plausible. It’s not as if these are principled people we are talking about. They will set their windmill based on which way the wind is blowing. Hope isn’t dead. It’s just flickering weakly.

        The reason the judges are pushing back on Dimon et al is that the Judges are from a different group. Mostly not Jewish, mostly non White, mostly Immigrant!They have the power and various Jewish groups and people are finding that Amy Chua’s “World on Fire” book about market dominant minorities getting genocided regularly still holds true even (or especially) under the Colors of Benetton. Jews occupy a profitable niche with power and money. Others from other groups want that power and money and will happily kill to get it.Just yesterday an Egyptian National who overstayed his tourist visa and got extended under Biden set a bunch of elderly Jews on fire in Boulder Colorado. Dems have said “we may never know the motive” but the Trump people have already charged the guy with a hate crime. Since the victims were elderly many may yet still die. You might or might not care about the people of Gaza (I don’t — I figure they wanted a war with Israel and should get one, good and hard) but to set a bunch of elderly Jews on fire or shoot a young Jewish couple in the back means like the Cartels setting up murder ranches in Mexico, other motives are in play.And just as I predicted, this stuff will accelerate. Like serial killers inspiring other serial killers, this stuff will bring out all the Muslim and Left Wing kooks who really, really just want a moral excuse to kill people. So there will be a clash between the Dimons and the Judges on this. [The FT just ran an editoral calling for massive sanctions on Israel and subtly hinted at military force to “Free Gaza” etc. This is basically Keir Starmer and Macron trying to hold off the coming Muslim coups they see coming.] Meanwhile Huckabee (who is good for a laugh now and then) called for a Palestinian State on the Cote de Zure.I love the smell of regime change in the morning. It smells like … victory.

        A new social order won’t be created by deliberate design. In the right conditions, it might grow organically from the remains of a dead way of life. It could take a century or more, and it will probably emerge from a religious revival.

        Maybe it should be surprising that the money men would be the first to notice, since the modern project boils down to binding people together with commerce. Sure, Reason! and all that, but reasonable people would choose prosperity over conflict. Just ask the libertarians. Reasonable people, LOL.Stuff over all else. Says something about the men who came up with it. There are limits to force, to blood, to ideas, to religion— and even greed, we’re finding out.The real question is of the trap, maybe the strong delusion: how do you resist smoking your own dope when everything’s going your way?

        The Z Man has pointed out that the attempt to reinstate social cohesion by deporting the hordes who have disrupted it is not going well. The job will be completed some time around doomsday at the present rate. It is probable that such a task is impossible in a rule-following liberal democracy. The new, post-ideological societies will have to be authoritarian to rebuild social cohesion. Better it should be a Franco rather than a Hitler.

        The deeper reason for why complex societies collapse is because Nature always wins in the end. One could take a look at societies, empires and civilizations as parasitic or even superparasitic structures on top of a host named Nature.Like Atlas shrugging off the world, so too does Nature shrug off any complex human organization. In the end, Nature destroys the value of words and language itself, leaving behind a soundless existence in which only small bands of hunter-gatherer types can survive.While many may lament such a reality, as it would lead to close to 99% of the current human population to die out, the consequences of poor or parasitic leadership would be experienced quickly, rather than this moribund decades-long decline.

        If you want a good understanding of the modern German Bundeswehr, you only need to read the Wikipedia write up on Carsten Breuer. He is the poster boy for everything wrong with the German military leadership and why no European military, especially Germany, has a chance in peer-to-peer combat, let alone a rogue insurgency.Like most Generals in any modern army today, the man has a chest full of ribbons proudly displayed as if he sat next to Rommel in the Battle of Gazala, or drove a tank during the Blitzkrieg, or the lead troops in the Battle of France or Operation Barbarossa.Instead we learn half the medals are, wait for it, participation medals for flood and fire service. I kid you not.This is the perfect example of a top brass desk jockey who probably doesn’t even know which end of a rifle the bullet comes out of. But if asked, can give you precise driving instructions to the the Biergarten near to where he’s currently stationed.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carsten_Breuer

        The advantage European-Americans have is a natural flexibility in adjusting to other white ethnic groups. The Irish married the Slovaks who married the English. This natural lubrication may allow places like Iowa and Oregon to rebuild social cohesion whereas California requires a heavily militarized police protection. One can envisage the LAPD patrolling around in steel APCs linked to helicopter gunships in the sky. The slightest resistance and bang you’re dead.
