        Steven Pinker’s book The Better Angels of Our Nature. Re-quote:In 16th-century Paris, a popular form of entertainment was cat-burning …“The spectators, including kings and queens, shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized.”I know we engaged in a lot of brutal behavior in past centuries, but, also, it’s Steven Pinker, and I am inherently distrustful of anything he says. As they say, I need citations.One Wikipedia article says there’s only one source that asserts cat massacres took place:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions_about_the_Middle_Ages#Cat_massacres_and_the_subsequent_plagueBut modern historians are all too eager to think ill of our ancestors.

            The enemies of traditional whites want to portray the historic whites as uniquely evil.  Any brutality attributed to our ancestors must be scrutinized.  Why does the number “6 million” come to mind?

        What is the follow-up to the amusing story from Radio Derb of 01-17-2025, concerning theGaité Lyriquetheater in Paris? They are loony-left, favoring open borders. On 12-10-2024, they staged a 3-day event on“Reinventing the welcome for refugees in France”.In addition to the usual academics, advocates &amp; activists, the organizers invited 250 migrants (mostly young, Black males) to join the audience. After the discussion, the migrants refused to leave. They have camped out there ever since, turning the place into a shit-hole. Their numbers have since swelled to over 400.The theater has ceased to operate and is going bankrupt. This entire episode is a good metaphor for the destruction of Europe by mass migration from Africa.Keir Starmerlikes it, of course. He is doing it on a national scale.

        The local elections in England offera little bitof good news, but don’t get your hopes up.  The affair with the Reform Party and Rupert Lowe shows that Reform might end up being about as effective as the pre-Trump GOP if they actually get in power.  Lowe was firmly, intelligently, and politely talking about the need for remigration and ending Net Zero madness, and bigshots Farage and Yusuf shoved him out in a craven way.  Farage has been awfully disappointing.  As many have said, his activity in various small parties shows that he’s more of a follower than a leader, and he can’t seem to stand challenges from other strong-minded persons who might have good ideas.Of course the media call Reform “far-right,” “radical-right,” etc., which is the usual lie.  Hopefully Reform would do better than the Tories, but that’s not saying much.The Tories did muchworsethan nothing while they were in power.  They brazenly allowed and encouraged the mass migration which started under Blair, acted like totalitarians with Covid, often went along with DEI, Net Zero, tranny crap, and other awfulness.  A certain monstrosity called “Non-Crime Hate Incidents” was implemented under them.  Theresa May and Boris Johnson were even worse than Sunak, and he was pretty bad himself.

            You are right about the British Tories. They are total traitors, and willing tools of the globalists. Globalists control the Media. The Media label all non-globalists as “far-right” or “anti-right”.
As for the Reform Party, I’m glad they won, even if they’re a bit squishy. They are still much better than any of the alternatives. The Media hate them, which is a good sign.

                Yes, good point about the media, and the alternatives. I suspect that the Reform base is more, err, “based” than the Reform leaders.
With the Globalists clamping down everywhere, as with the AfD in Germany, it’ll be interesting to see how long this pressure cooker builds, and what happens when the lid blows off. The political and social problems just seem to keep getting worse, with less and less of an outlet for people.
Your namesake would have approached things in a much smarter way than Keir and Ursula, although I suppose they’re just tools of others with more power.

        I don’t know where Trump got his idea about Canada, but he really needs to drop it. Taking in the whole of Canada, whether as one state or thirteen, would be like adding another California to our electorate. And doing it by force, which is what “annex” implies, would be so resented that it would probably turn even their “slobs” against us.

            Our refineries are designed for Alberta’s heavy tar sands oil, so I see this as a part of Lutnick’s scheme to harvest mining/drilling rights as the collateral backing for a new round of debt issuance.

        Derby is absolutely right about how animals were tortured for entertainment in the middle ages. Sadly both animals and humans are treated pretty barbarously in some of the backward parts of the world even today. As an aside I thought I might point out that heretics were literally burned at the stake or suffered other horrible torture and deaths in Europe. In fact unless I’m mistaken I think they were burning “witches” until the 18th century.Speaking for my own account I would have absolutely no problem taking the Oliveros of the world and treating them exactly the way they tortured animals. I work with rescued animals so perhaps I am biased.

            Animals are animals. We are given dominion over them. We kill them for food, and I want us to do it humanely, but the death of an animal is on a lower moral level than the death of a human … but not a zero moral level. I’ve worked with and owned far too many animals to think they don’t feel love, fear, trust and betrayal.My main problem with people like Oliveros is that if a human is willing to visit that cruelty upon an animal, he is probably fundamentally broken in his ability to feel empathy for other beings and it’s dangerously likely that he will sooner or later visit that violence on people.

        There’s a sucker born every minute, P.T. Barnum observed, and the sales of these atheist tracts, of whichgod Is Not Greatis only one, argue that he was guilty of gross understatement. On the one hand, Hitchens ascribes religion to “wish-thinking”; on the other, he blames it for creating a horrible and wholly false vision of Hell. Well, which is it? I can say only that it seems to me obvious which side is guilty of wishful thinking, starting with the pleasant idea that we will never have to answer for our sins.
