        Ingratitude. It is a common idea that pride is the root of sin; ‚ÄúIt was pride that made Lucifer the Devil‚Äù.But when you read St. Paul in Romans one, he seems to think it was ingratitude. When I read this (forget where), I said, ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù. But as I studied it &amp; thought, I could see it. ‚ÄúWhat have ye, that ye have not received?‚Äù

        A very Happy Thanksgiving to you Z and all of my fellow dissidents here. One of my favorite things about this site are the reading recommendations from Z and other commenters here.I‚Äôve ordered at least fifteen books the last year alone based on titles provided by people here. That alone is worth the price of admission. The feast this year was a but different in that my family pretty much has had it with everything and mentally is now in a ‚ÄúEff those who hate us, what do we have to lose!‚Äù mindset. Nothing was spoken about this, it is a shift in body language, changes in what the younger ones ‚Äì my nieces and nephews ‚Äì are doing.Both of my nieces changed their majors, one is now majoring in nursing and wants to work in the ER, the other switched to accounting and is asking my father about being an actuarial as well. Both said they wanted something practical. They and my nephews also asked about starting gardens in the spring. I also got quizzed on a lot of history. No politics were discussed at all, save for Cuomo mentioning that he might run for mayor of NYC, what a joke.It was a wonderful evening, I haven‚Äôt been able to say that in quite some time. God bless everyone here and enjoy the day!

        I‚Äôm certainly thankful for this blog and the commenters here too. A lot of other sites I‚Äôve been on have shut down or become moribund but Z keeps going and his commenters bring lots of genuine enlightenment to the internet! Happy Thanksgiving to you all!

        Happy Thanksgiving to all of you ‚Äì and to Z.
Regarding Z and the commentators, I‚Äôm thankful for knowing that I‚Äôm not alone. I‚Äôm also thankful that more and more people are coming our way, even if they continue to stick with their colorblind CivNat fantasy. But even that‚Äôs alright. Most of us took the same path.
Enjoy the feast.

        Happy Thanksgiving
Agree with the 2nd last paragraph. We are blessed to be at the frontlines of this fight.
It is worse to be a Boomer ‚Äì struggle for nothing, build nothing, live for nothing, die for nothing, sell out your grandchildren for nothing, just to see your society destroyed as you die but not even have the capacity to know why.

        A white pill to go with the pumpkin pie.
Along with the lack of soulless gift giving the other reason Thanksgiving hasn‚Äôt been assimilated into the GAE is that while it‚Äôs a food holiday, it‚Äôs cheap food made from scratch.  Valentine‚Äôs, Easter, and Halloween have processed candy with a good profit margin, while there aren‚Äôt any hand rubbing Jews getting rich off the shekels from sweet potatoes and cranberries.

            The traditional Thanksgiving meal is rich in New World foods, and whether historically accurate of the first thanksgiving or not favors ingredients that would have been local to New England.

                Because we prefer the white meat to the dark‚Äìheh‚ÄìI make an herb-roasted turkey breast on Thanksgiving. It is unfailingly excellent, if I do say so myself.

        I thank God for my family and friends. I thank Him for giving me a curious, rational and realist mind; and thinkers like Zman to feed it.Z is absolutely spot on that rampant ingratitude is the acid that dissolves our communities. But hard times make good men; and I thank God that those white men who are grateful for life‚Äôs former blessings will once again kindle the fire for civilization building. Happy Thanksgiving every one!

        Thanksgiving is such a deplorable-approved holiday it surprises me that it hasn‚Äôt been canceled (yet). Blacks are too clueless to understand that indigenous peoples (‚Äúinjuns‚Äù to us blue-eyed ice devils) are no more willing to ally themselves with the embarrassingly infantile and volatile black community than is any other aggrieved group. But that should not stand in the way of them insisting that anything YT approves of is inherently racist and cancel-worthy. How they missed Thanksgiving is a mystery.Perhaps they misinterpret ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù Friday as some flavor of reparational gibsmedat. It sounds sorta like it could be a day of [White] atonement and [black] looting.I shouldn‚Äôt be so bitter and snarky on a holiday that has long been one of my favorites. So if you will excuse me now, I‚Äôll be over at HeyJackass! monitoring the body counts in real time and counting my blessings for my White lineage.Enjoy the holiday, all.

There are seven indian reservations in this state (they refer to themselves as indian not native, a construct white womyn).  In any case, many younger indians eschew indian culture and instead dress like ghetto blacks.  It is baffling, as are wiggers.
‚ÄúBlacks are clueless‚Äù and few here but not their influence.

            I recall back when college SJWs were the big thing they would bitch every year about Thanksgiving.  It also was apparently a ritual time for freshman college students to become estranged from their families during their visit home after their first semester.
I think covid broke college because you don‚Äôt really hear about that stuff anymore, or perhaps the millennial puritans just aged into the workforce and the zoomers are too dumb to have any ideological thought to begin with.

                Sixty years ago I was a college freshman and less than a week before Thanksgiving President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. I traveled home for Thanksgiving but it was a listless affair with the memory of the somber state funeral in Washington DC so fresh in everyone‚Äôs mind. I don‚Äôt remember much about the rest of the semester after November but I do have a vivid recollection of returning to college after the Christmas break and everyone‚Äôs stereos in our dorm were blasting non-stop Beatles‚Äô ‚ÄúShe Loves You, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah‚Äù! A page had turned and a new, not very edifying, world called The Sixties was upon us.

        Today‚Äôs posting is an archetypal example of the power of words to express an important idea and communicate the feelings that accompany the recognition of true wisdom. This is essential gift of Zman. He is the shaman that lights the path for all dissidents on the road to redeeming both ourselves and our nation. Without this guidance we are lost. Without this knowledge we are powerless. Without this inspiration we are defeated before we even start.I am grateful to be here among my kind and know that I am not alone. Thank you all for being my reason to keep on keeping on.

        ‚ÄúIt is our nature to build and create, which is why we are naturally grateful for what we have. A people who built a great civilization out of nothing have a lot to be thankful for, so having a long holiday to take our time and be grateful makes a lot of sense.Even now, with all that is going on, we have plenty of reasons to take the next few days to count our blessings. The Good Lord in his wisdom has provided us with enemies who possess none of the qualities we respect. They may have inherited power, but they lack the ability to wield it responsibly. Like men on death row, our betters walk around with an expiry date on them. It is a long struggle, but we know that in the end we will prevail and for that we must be thankful.‚ÄùThis is utter delusion, Z.What you call creating and building a civilization out of nothingness, Nature calls corruption.You will not prevail. In the end, all the ice will melt and timeless paradise will exist once more. A different word for timeless paradise: nothing.Before the beginning there was nothing and in the end, nothing will return again.All Civilizations fade, for all Civilizations are perversions of the timeless, nameless, flawless perfect that is Paradise.How can you ever see the Truth, it only holds absolute Terror for you. I don‚Äôt blame you for holding on to your delusions of what Civilization truly is.

            All the downvotes! As a civ skeptic, I agree with KingKong to an extent. It is an artificial world created within the natural world, and it is possible to be over-civilized girly men. No doubt about it today.Plus, it‚Äôs a Near-Eastern thing, so I was taught. (Getting speculative, but if you believe the myth, Rome‚Äî the standard for some‚Äî could‚Äôve been called New Troy. Maybe the Byzantine Empire was just a homecoming, in a sense.)Anyway, there is the part of me that has wondered why people of northern- and western-European origin would be so attached to this Asiatic Thing, and how much of ourselves we‚Äôve been alienated from by it. As if our people were hopeless until grafted onto it. Wondering loudly lately.

        Zman,
I am grateful that, what now seems like a long time ago, I stumbled across your Theory of Everything.  That was the first time my eyes were opened to the truth of what is going on around us.  I have been a daily reader since.  Last year I bucked up and subscribed to the premium content, but really to support the main site.  It‚Äôs the best bargain on the internet.  Like you, I am thankful for the commenters, from who I have also learned a lot.  Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

        In the early 1980s I was stationed in the service in Germany, where they shut down all their stores on Sunday, save pharmacies and gas stations. It was wonderful. The city, Frankfurt, where you recently were, was quiet and people went on strolls after church. Some cities and states in America used to have Blue Laws. I remember Virginia did in the mid-1980s, under a law dating to 1610, but their law was overturned in 1988 by the state supreme court, corrupted by the metastasizing U.S. government parasites in Northern Virginia and the leftist parasites at UVA in Charlottesville. The companies that brought the lawsuit, Kmart, Circuit City and Hechinger, all later went bankrupt. Small justice. After the revolution, the Blue Laws return, everywhere. And: Happy Thankstiving!https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1988/09/24/end-of-era-va-blue-laws-overturned/973256a3-30c9-46b3-a461-534e0c954c47/

            Blue laws still exist in certain counties in certain states. And, sure, in theory‚Ä¶ GREAT idea! In practice‚Ä¶ I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want it to be a universal prohibition. And my opposition is practical as well as libertarian. Do you want to shut down restaurants‚Ä¶ breweries‚Ä¶ wineries‚Ä¶ distilleries‚Ä¶? How‚Äôbout museums‚Ä¶ sports stadiums‚Ä¶ amusement parks‚Ä¶??? I mean‚Ä¶ geezus‚Ä¶ just PONDER all the ramifications both for members of the general public ‚Äì consumers, customers ‚Äì and those who want to or need to work on Sunday for whatever reason.

Thank you for providing a forum for the best commentariat on the internet, from whom I have learned so much.

        Zman, you have been a gift to me and many others. I‚Äôm thankful for you even being blocked (with good reason) by you.This is a hopeful, powerful excerpt-‚ÄúEven now, with all that is going on, we have plenty of reasons to take the next few days to count our blessings. The Good Lord in his wisdom has provided us with enemies who possess none of the qualities we respect. They may have inherited power, but they lack the ability to wield it responsibly. Like men on death row, our betters walk around with an expiry date on them. It is a long struggle, but we know that in the end we will prevail and for that we must be thankful.Of course, we also have the community of dissidents that is slowly forming up to provide fellowship and support as we struggle though this age. ‚Äú

What on earth? We have our own Thanksgiving. Likely imported with the United Empire Loyalists. Though in truth, I never thought about it. And like someone else pointed out, our harvest season is earlier, so our Thanksgiving follows suit.

Thank You for my health, the means that I have &amp; Thy will be done with it. But most of all thank you for sending your son to die on the cross for my sins who I accept as My Lord &amp; Savior. That is a debt I can never repay. Please have mercy on me for I am a sinner. It is in Your Son‚Äôs precious Name I pray, Amen.Happy Thanksgiving to All.

        Agree that T-giving is best US holiday, but can‚Äôt resist being a bit contrarian, so apologies in advance.‚ÄúWhat makes the holiday better than most is that it is at least a four day weekend and is slowly becoming a weeklong affair.‚Äù4 days is plenty.  3 days are plenty.  Most people don‚Äôt know what to do with themselves with too few much free time.  That‚Äôs why after Turkey, they want to go shopping, go to a movie, or watch football on the idiot box.  Believe it or not, people with decent jobs are generally more content by many metrics when focused and in the flow at work.Probably the best thing to do after eating, would be some touch football with the fam in the backyard or something.

        That was a beautiful post.
This is a holiday for us alone in these dark times but one day we will celebrate it again in victory for it does not resonate with those enriching us. Right now I can hear the sounds of the workmen building a house next door. I guarantee you they‚Äôre all Mexican.  For them it‚Äôs just a weird white holiday or perhaps they are paid more today.

        It‚Äôs funny, we haven‚Äôt exported Thanksgiving but I keep seeing Black Friday sales from lots of foreign sites I visit. So, looks like we‚Äôve stripped out the unprofitable nonsense about being thankful and exported the essential commercial piece. Because of course we did.

        The people I care to know I‚Äôm thankful know it, so no use in virtue signaling about it here. That said, I‚Äôm also thankful to have been a part of dissident politics in its various incarnations for nigh 45 years now. It‚Äôs been one helluva ride with a great lot of you. Thanks and Godspeed to you all (especially the Jew enthusiast pagan bastards).

        Happy Thanksgiving to all here especially our host. Hope to hear more on your future digs. As for gratitude, in all honesty, the worst insult I would feel would be to accuse me of ingratitude. I try to check myself everyday in prayer and silent contemplation that I never become an ingrate in anything. Been very blessed for sure.
