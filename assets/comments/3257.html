        Ever heard of AIPAC? Adelson OWNS the GOP and Saban OWNS the Dems (thats why Hillary will be POTUS in 2016).
The whole mess in Ukraine was instgated by Nuland an the Kagans with the Ukrainian jewish oligarchs, Putin isn’t anti-jewish but he is a independent leader outside of the (Jewish) Anglo-American powersphere.

        WW2 was but a continuation of the Great War, 1914-1945. If Russia were actually a thriving imperial power she could walk into Europe without opposition right now. Just as the Europeans were already done with war the intellectualoids thought to end nationalism to end war, without ever understanding the essential benefits of  nations to civilization.  What the eunuch powers understand is centralization and uniformity.

        “…fanatics see only that which confirms their fanaticism.”When the ONLY thing you’re looking for is another “victim” to champion (and maybe bring into “the tent” of strange bed fellowes (sic)), then that’s ALL you can see.SOME might call it “grooming”.I’m almost SURE that at least ONE of (ie)Aesop’s Fables covers this malady of human nature, known long before the APA’s D and SM of MD “reinterpreted” it out of existence due to “public” pressure.

        American intellectuals might be looking to Europe for their ideas, but your average awake and aware (not to be confused with the somnolent sheep) American is not. Half the population is deeply angry about what is being done to our nation. If it doesn’t actually come to a civil war, I still wouldn’t be surprised to see the country break apart.
