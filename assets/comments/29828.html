        I used to listen to Rush,I used to read National Review, and The American Spectator. In the early 2000‚Äôs I realized I was being lied to and gaslighted and promptly kicked their asses to the curb.I came to this epiphany by discovering alt right or dissident writers such as Zman and others on the internet.The problem with mainstream conservative grillers is they refuse to pull their heads out of con inc‚Äôs ass!Listening to the same con inc pundits, voting harder for the sane con inc candidates, and getting the same results.The truth tellers, even the old con inc stalwarts who go through an epiphany and start revealing the con, con inc is like Pat Buchanan and Tucker Carlson are promptly called heretics and deep sixed.The thing Carlson was able to accomplish, is the typical con inc Fox viewer tuned in likely expecting bow tie Tucker to give them the old, comfy, company line, and what they saw was Tucker getting red pilled in real-time, evolving into the alt right, anti con inc firebrand he is now. In turn his viewers became red pilled by association.Carlson turned out to be a Trojan Horse.We need more Trojan Horses.

        Outside of whites and Eastern Asians, no one expects competency so the lack of it won‚Äôt be perceived as a problem by customers.
A great example is Mexico, the source of most of our replacements. Mexicans just accept that trying to accomplish anything is a nightmare because the person they are dealing with likely is both incompetent and determined to do the least work possible.
Yes, it  will hurt productivity and the economy but things will still be better than Latin America, India and Africa.
Plus soon, whites won‚Äôt be able to complain without being labeled a racist

        Been there, done that. Took my last job rather than retire because I believe people should work, even if it means taking a junior position. I figured I‚Äôd do inside sales and the money sucked‚Ä¶but it would give me something to do and keep me out of jail.The kids were pooch screwing morons glued to their phones. My outside guy was a pajeet that never left the office or did anything. That includes the managers. The manageress decided she would only work 7.5 hours a day and I could pick up the slack. In short order my days were usually 12 hours long  and I was only getting paid for 8. The more work I did, the more I was given. I discussed it with the owner and was told I had a bad attitude so I just quit. Not kidding either‚Ä¶as soon as we got off the phone, I wrote out my letter of resignation, no two weeks notice, no goodbyes, hit send‚Ä¶ and just got up and left. The pajeet I shared the office with didn‚Äôt even look up from the cricket match he was watching on OyTube.I went home, poured a tall drink‚Ä¶and decided to retire. I think we are conditioned to think retirement means sailing off into the sunset on a yacht with millions in the bank‚Ä¶but so far‚Ä¶my retirement is just fine. I struggle to stay busy and lose a lot‚Ä¶but other than that‚Ä¶? My gawd‚Ä¶what a relief. There‚Äôs actually been a crisis in competence for at least 50 years. The Boomers were as bad as the millennials, truth be told.

            Sounds about right for Canada lol.If you show up on time, shower regularly, and don‚Äôt steal from the company, that puts you in the top 50% of the workforce. Bonus if you can speak English at a literate level.If you hit those 3 criteria you can basically do whatever you want, since firing you will be worse for the company than having to sift through all the bums to find another seat filler.Certainly unfortunate, but it also opens new opportunities to make money if you can do a little bit more (but you have to be smart about it, and not get taken advantage of).

                Yeah but‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt work like that.
I‚Äôm in Alberta, home of eeeeeevil Big Oil in Canada. Liberals hate them and are crippling the oil companies with confiscatory ‚Äúgreen taxes‚Äù. They can‚Äôt make a buck, so the oilfield operates at minimum capacity. And for every single oilfield job lost‚Ä¶ 4 more pink slips go out in the supporting industries.
We have the same problem that the US military does: the cream is not rising to the top.

                I‚Äôve heard a similar lament for U.S. blue collar or lower tier workers: In many trades, if one is an employee who merely shows up sober and at the expected time, he is far ahead of his competition. üôÇ

        How do you have the time to do everything that you do? Full time job, daily postings, a weekly audiocast, other platforms and your voluminous reading. I take it you live alone and have to do all the regular errands and chores single people do plus care for your cats. I can‚Äôt imagine you have much of  social life.
We should petition Tucker to have you on his new show if he were to have one. You‚Äôd be sitting a curtain, I suspect.

        Thanks to the person who posted the link to Z‚Äôs sub stack account.One of the organizations he does work for came to him to ‚Äúhelp save them from themselves‚Äù.I hope that Z added a few zeros to the end of any fee Z is charging.I recently bid a job and lost it, because my price was higher than the competition. I related to the end user that my product guaranteed a 3 year warranty on parts and labor.I was selling a rolls Royce, the other guys a Yugo.Needless to say, last weekend I got a call regarding a failure of the new stuff the other guys put in. What I predicted would happen, happened.Weekend callAfter hoursTriple timeWhen all was said and done, the cost of getting the product operational,(it‚Äôs still a piece of junk), cost more than the price difference of the two items. And there‚Äôs no warranty.Z‚Äôs customer probably knew better, but still waited till the last minute anyway.The point is, when people do stupid things, and you tell them their doing stupid things, and they still decide on the stupid things, well, you may as well get paid for it.

                Last weekend The Lovely ü•∞ Mrs. and I went to a beer festival. It was set up in a small town and individual breweries set up tents to give out small pours of their beers.Some breweries used those tailgating ‚Äúpop up‚Äù tents with a metal frame and a snap on fabric top. At the end of the fest one such unattended tent got caught by a big wind gust and thrown atop a fence and into some live power lines. Some nimrod ran up to grab it and pull it down not realizing or understanding the frame was resting on live power lines. We were all yelling at him to stop, he was going to get electrocuted. Eventually the cops in attendance had to grab him and keep him away. Otherwise I suspect the end result would‚Äôve been like your video ‚ö°Ô∏èüî•üíÄ.

        ‚ÄúThe other thing a week like this brings to the front of the brain is that the number of capable people is shrinking‚Ä¶ For now, there are enough capable people to keep the plates spinning, but at some point, they simply stop either because they are dead or they are tired of carrying the burden.‚ÄùYep. My own experiences in the job market have been very negative. Consequently I simply DGAF any more. I have personally been canned from jobs  and replaced by people far less competent, and seen the same happen to other white men.This is partly due to the pressure to hire incompetent minorities and women, but only partly. Even in organizations run entirely by white men, I have seen management prioritize being a low-wage, subservient lackey over being a take-charge, independent critical thinker. Every institution only wants to hire people who will STFU and accept the lowest possible wage they can get away with paying.Then they bitch about not being able to find good help.When they do find that rare unicorn of an employee who is both competent and a lackey, he gets overloaded with work because it is simply easier to give it to him than to deal with the hassle of trying to get the incompetents to do it and fuck it up in the process. Or get sued for disciplining or firing Shaniqua and Consuela.I am willing to work, I have always been willing to work, even to do some rather dirty and unpleasant jobs. But I will not waste the limited amount of time I have remaining on God‚Äôs green Earth making somebody else rich or making somebody or else look good if I am being treated like shit and working for shit wages and surrounded by lowlifes for co-workers. I would rather be a bum than work 80 hours a week and then give the government 30-40% of my pay to fund government employee pensions and healthcare for illegal aliens.

Millions of other men ‚Äî in the U.S. alone ‚Äî share your experiences and sentiments.  In one way or another, they are checking out of a society that has made clear its resentment and hatred towards them for four decades.Now, of course, their Glorious Woke-Fem Empire is coming unglued, due to the infiltration and domination of every institution by . . . Their Fabulous Selves.  That femmie-tech bank folding was just a fore sign.And now, of course, they have become desperate as competent white men refuse marriage, employment, and interaction with them.  They still want us to fight their wars (from subordinate positions, while being ‚Äòre-educated‚Äô constantly) and to maintain their infrastructure (from subordinate positions, while being ‚Äòre-educated‚Äô constantly)Yeah.

        I went back to my old job this week.  I left because I was the only person in the department working, and the stress of a seven year software project that was about to go live was leading to chest pains. I was the only person anyone contacted, and boy did they. Supervisor, who was also overloaded, eventually informed me I was on call 24/7 ‚Äì for no extra pay.  So I left, and spent a year gardening, playing with my pets, and making expensive purchases that made me happy.  But like many Huwhytes‚Ä¶.I need more purpose, and two capable people are now in the department, and I was still letting people know how things worked a year later‚Ä¶.so why not get paid?  It‚Äôs honestly good to be back. I even worked today (Saturday) because having purpose is important, and I like my field.  The small hats are genociding us‚Ä¶..but they won‚Äôt like what the world looks like with us gone.

        I think a large part of the lack in competence is also due to the smart fraction (i.e. White males) being frozen out of the good schools in favor of the vibrants.
Without those credentials, useless as they are, you see more and more young White men being underutilized and forced to work in lower paying, less important jobs. Many are dropping out altogether. Then you have the problem of competent people having a hard time starting a family, while the dummies seem to have no problem breeding like rabbits.

            True. Nobody is born an expert at anything, people need to be given work experience, internships, admission to educational programs, and hired onto entry-level jobs that lead to promotions.All of that stuff ‚Äî literally all of it ‚Äî may as well have a flashing neon ‚Äúno white men need apply‚Äù sign. Look at the HR ads of literally any major corporation, or the advertisements for any government agency or university program, and you will see nothing but Negroes and women depicted in the most unrealistic manner, e.g., railroads advertising for employees showing a colored woman standing on a locomotive or construction companies showing a woman running a backhoe, or single black moms in infantry units.

            I‚Äôm also seeing white men retreating to smaller organizations. We may end up like South Africa, where if you are white and want to work, you need your own business.I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre dropping out, but their potential is definitely getting under utilized as ‚Äúmiddle manager at some small town construction company‚Äù (compared to say, multionational senior manager).Also noticing some rural migration from whites. For the first time in a long time small towns look better kept, and seem to have more activity going on. People have been leaving the cities.Most of them still have families which is good, but they are definitely starting to retreat from bigger cities and bigger corporations. (And also being pushed out, lots of big corps no longer hire white men).

                To some extent you have to believe in the system to be a good consumer and thus need a large income.
What exactly is stopping you from just wearing your socks upside down once the bottom part gets holes?  Half of the sock fabric is still in good condition, you‚Äôre just worried about what all the other consoomers will think of you if you have to take your shoes off.

                Agree on the whole. But (in my opinion) the novel was apt dramatization of the destination of socialism/collectivism/communism carried, perhaps, to its (il)logical conclusion.
By the way, Rand‚Äôs ‚Äúprediction‚Äù of the future US Government was remarkably prescient, in the most general terms of course. The novel emphasizes an ever growing government-business partnership. Better known as coporatism or fascism.
Obviously, a core theme of the story is that the competent men* who really keep civilizaiton running are being shit on until they‚Äôve had enough and drop out of sight.
*Rand even threw in one broad (Dagny), rather progressive for the 1950s.

            My wife and I visited a friend and his wife this weekend and we enjoyed dinner, drinks, and conversation.I worked with the husband for nearly three years on a project at his employer. I haven‚Äôt worked with him for about three and a half years but we keep in touch and have phone calls or dinners together.So he and I get to talking about work. He‚Äôs older than me, and very close to retirement age. If he wanted to he could quit and go on Medicare for his insurance. But he‚Äôs a bright guy and on the ball even in his sixties. He‚Äôs working at Major Manufacturer and moonlighting as a professor at a local Community College.He relates to me that he‚Äôs been working on a software package for the interim three plus years since we worked together. The software tracks defects and remediation. He‚Äôs gotten pretty well versed in the software through planning upgrades and installing them and understands it well enough. So Major Manufacturer needs a Product Manager for the software. My friend applies, after all, he‚Äôs worked with the software and the configuration for three years now. Gets told no, he‚Äôs at management level X, this is a management level Y job, and the company hires someone else from another company who has worked with the software but doesn‚Äôt know anything about his company‚Äôs processes.So my friend goes to his manager and asks ‚ÄúWell, what do you want me to do now?‚ÄùHis manager: Shrugs shoulders ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, tells him basically ‚ÄúI Dunno‚Äù.My friend has been doing a minimal amount of work with the outside Product Manager they hired but the guy is remote and maybe meets with him once a week. He‚Äôs a Product Owner and per his comments he gets negative feedback from his team in HR reviews if he sets timelines and expectations for deliverables. He related that he was called ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù and ‚Äúoverbearing‚Äù in a recent review. I‚Äôve worked with the guy and he‚Äôs about one of the most easygoing guys I‚Äôve ever worked with. But, Millennials and Gen-Z you know.So, he‚Äôs decided to keep his head down, do minimal work with Major Manufacturer, do piecework for other teams, and focus on his lesson plans and grading exams. His view is ‚Äúas long as they pay me, I‚Äôll stay. It‚Äôs a ridiculous waste though.‚ÄùI‚Äôm betting there are plenty more fellows like him around. Made that way by the foolishness and rigidity of the corporate world.

When I first studied Win11 I was appalled that ‚Äî upon initial release at least ‚Äî Micro$oft intended to lock down the system. Only approved apps obrtained from the MS Store could run. Fortuantely, there‚Äôs a way to bypass that. I‚Äôve rarely if ever used MS‚Äôs bells and whistles and ignore what I can‚Äôt uninstall or disable. To MS‚Äôs credit, all my preferred apps work..including a few obscure ones from the 1990s. I still Use Office 2000 which installed ‚Äî not without complaint, and works, well, most of the time.

            Painter, you mention the depop crowd and the loathing that they inspire.  I understand your reaction.  There is something ghoulish about the great reset Davos crowd.

For me, being a white nationalist, the issue is simplified.  I want my people to flourish, and, if necessary, at the expense of other peoples.  I don‚Äôt wish for such an outcome, but am ready to face it, if necessary.

                ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt we need depopulation? Doesn‚Äôt the planet have a finite carrying capacity?‚Äù
That‚Äôs the thing. I don‚Äôt know what Earth‚Äôs carrying capacity is, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs much higher than what we‚Äôve got today. Maybe Earth could be turned into Coruscant, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to live there, so I‚Äôm in favor of fewer people.
I‚Äôm an advocate of living closer to nature and letting nature do the dirty work. This people-farming business doesn‚Äôt sit well with me at all. But I think the deed‚Äôs already been done, so my opinion on the matter is moot, I guess.

            Thanks to some good history by Neofeudal, I think we‚Äôre seeing ‚Äútwo man press‚Äù, two ganging up to remove the larger one.China, her lands polluted, barren, and with little fresh water, gets good plantation farmland in the US, EU, and Commonwealth; the browns as an enforcer, maintaince, and farm labor class, since the whites will suffer the same fate as urbanites wearing glasses in the Mao Cultural and Pol Pot Cambodian revolutions.(Those not reduced to smuggler enclaves in hostile terrain, that is.)The Middlemen will gain permanent class employment, a ruling niche, as they did in the USSR.We‚Äôll be in a Intermediate Period of fractious kingdoms, like Egypt or of course post-Rome.  Been reading synopses on those periods and boy do they rhyme.

Fabian socialism isn‚Äôt American, nor was Weimar. We hardly have the monopoly, or even the pride of being first.And I put ‚ÄòBritish‚Äô in quotes because it has about as much to do with your country as ‚ÄòAmericanism‚Äô has to do with America imo. We‚Äôre talking about post-national people. Internationalists, globalists‚Äî whatever names they‚Äôve been given.But with all that said, nasty, high-handed, exploitative elites who might as well think they‚Äôre a different species seem to be endemic to the English-speaking world.

        First, ‚Äúthat which does not kill us makes us stronger‚Äù is still an evolutionary truism.
Second, life would be boring if not for curveball challenges to stimulate the cerebral cortex.
Third, yes the West is now drowning in deadweight, but we cannot wish or persuade our way out of that dilemma. Only a collapse and return of real hardship can sort the wheat from the chaff.
Fourth, its best to watch the sorting process from a distance.

            Today at Costco I encountered literal zombies.  They weren‚Äôt just the typical oblivious people who don‚Äôt seem to understand how to not block the aisle or drive a cart.  It wasn‚Äôt just the lumps of flesh eating the disgusting samples ‚Äì civilized people do not eat in a grocery.  These creatures were staggering around with a 1000 yard stare‚Ä¶no cart.  They would just stall out in the middle of an aisle and stare into space.  Most were boomers so I don‚Äôt think they were on oxy ‚Äì although psychotropics could be in play.  It was genuinely scary.  Given the local (Hawaii) culture I couldn‚Äôt yell at them as I would have in Texas. So me and the other handful of sentient beings just looked at each other in stunned silence.  Things are headed to a bad place, and it is accelerating.

        I don‚Äôt know whether we‚Äôre running out of competent people or they just gave up.   Z had often wrote during COVID that you can‚Äôt just turn off half an economy without repercussions many of which can‚Äôt be anticipated.I observe a lot of links in the chain broke, that a lot of people just this year really came back to work (whether they were officially on leave or not) and are surprised at how long and how difficult it is to get things done now.  I had involvement with different occupations lets say and I observed this phenomenon Corporate, globally and locally, as well as military.   The people who kept working through it got overworked and STILL ARE, are tired. The people who checked back in a couple of months ago were quite difficult for a bit , seem to have adjusted, and seem to have checked back out; don‚Äôt let anyone tell you that a corporate job isn‚Äôt that different from government once they find that spot.  We‚Äôve had people collecting checks who seem only to auto-forward emails for years.I‚Äôm tired and grumpy, and at long last am finding ways to communicate to the half of coworkers who don‚Äôt produce that I‚Äôm willing to help, I‚Äôm not their slave.Give a man a fish, he eats for a day.Teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime.   I guess hunger worked.These days teach a man to fish or especially a woman (you‚Äôre nearly all useless) they caught a master fisherman, until you toss it back at them.  Especially Her.  It‚Äôs becoming extremely irritating women think we‚Äôre slaves like their husbands.Some of us kept working, our chances are better than the others.The social and political, Constitutional contracts, laws were all shredded in a panicked response to Populism, so we really are Germany in the 20s/30s now.Something bad follows; and the Veteran and Warrior in me Doesn‚Äôt Give A F.DGAF;  you did this to yourselves.

        Z-man, the dilligent effort you put into these podcasts is much appreciated; and it shows in the consistent quality of your finished product.
OTOH, I‚Äôve especially enjoyed those episodes in which you appeared to be ‚Äòwinging it‚Äô: talking ‚Äòoff the top of your head‚Äô, about whatever comes to mind. IMO, those have been some of your most interesting offerings.
So who knows? an epsode in which you go into it completely unprepared, and tired to the point of exhaustion, just might turn out to be your best show ever.

        *If you want to know how poorly you speak, spend a couple hours every week editing your own voice.*For Christmas 1968 I got a Crown-Corder reel to reel tape recorder. I started recording family and myself on New Year‚Äôs Eve at our family table.The next day I played it back and was shocked at the sound of my own voice. It was the first time I‚Äôd ever heard it the way others did (and still do). My goodness, what a revelation! Who IS that adenoidal freak on the tape?Anyone who can do what you do and make it sound good does well to keep to his standards. Having pride is rare and we‚Äôre happy to stick to it.

            What you describe (perceiving one‚Äôs own voice as alien) is perfectly normal. I‚Äôve experienced the same. The explanation is probably simply that you‚Äôre used to hearing your voice coming from your own mouth, not a disembodied machine. But if you have other familiar voices on the playback, they usually sound remarkably lifelike ‚Äî except, probably, to the owner of the voice.

        A mild Lent this week, no T.C. , no Zman podcast,  I took a Zman bike ride this morning and cracked open Brave New World , derb is busting out of jigsaw puzzle, that sounded good too. By the way T.C. replacement is a 30 yr old jogger this week. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre in for the continuos parade of  Whitlock and Owens. Steady as she goes. Same old same old. Nothing to see here. I‚Äôm sure VICTOR DAVIS is willing and able doing one handed push-ups in the green room.

        My most poignant experience was working on a project from hell that had your schedule, but the crunch lasted over two years. One of my strongest memories was a  contractor who worked himself so hard he had a full-blown panic attack at work, was rushed to the hospital, and was back at the office in the afternoon.Another guy after a year of intense stress didn‚Äôt feel well one day, decided to take a hot bath, and died.It‚Äôs no wonder some of our best guys said ‚Äú40 hours, no more‚Äù. After some threats, hey basically said they were indispensable and gave the middle finger to management. Not one was fired, as they really were indispensable.

            I used to work at a new company that had lots of potential and all of us who were there at the beginning had the opportunity to grow and prosper with it. Everyone was gung ho. 80+ hour weeks were the norm. Eventually, we figured out that this led to a lot of errors, so we put a cap on it at 60.

            There are some famous old theorems in the theory of stochastic modelling which hold that once you get ‚Äútoo far‚Äù behind the present, you can never ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù again, and if you attempt to catch up, then you will doom yourself to being stuck in the past forever [meaning that, say, being two weeks behind on everything will simply be your new normal, from now until the end of time].In a troubled bidness, management will hire the very moast highly priced ‚Äúconsultants‚Äù to invade the orifice and start screaming at the poor wagie wage slave cubicle monkeys to  ‚ÄúCUT YOUR QUEUE TIMES! CUT YOUR QUEUE TIMES!! CUT YOUR QUEUE TIMES!!!‚ÄùBut it doesn‚Äôt do any good.Something simply has to be jettisoned in order to get yourself out of the past and back into the present again.

            Many years ago on a SW development project with a very large team, we discovered that one of our colleague who had just departed (for a better job, curse him) had done absolutely nothing on his task. Two of us had to implement his entire component in a week, working until 2AM eating chocolate covered coffee beans. Mission accomplished, but if I did it at my current age it would kill me.

        My only audiobook, so far, was voice acted by me.  It‚Äôs about eight hours.  It took two months to record and three to edit in Audacity.
It‚Äôs one of the reasons I did podcasts for about six months then walked away.  I have more important things to do.

            Tucker Carlson was talking about these sorts of things recently.‚ÄúThe undeniably big topics, the ones that will define our future, get virtually no discussion at all: War, civil liberties, emerging science, demographic change, corporate power, natural resources; when was the last time you heard a legitimate debate about any of those issues?
