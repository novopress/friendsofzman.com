        Perhaps he is all that. Perhaps. Speaking only for myself, however, I grow more and more suspicious of The Purity Test.The result always sounds a lot like William Burroughs’ routine about “the tent.”To wit: “I’ve heard some tired conversation but no other OCCUPATION GROUP can approximate that old thermodynamic junk Slow-DOWN. Now your heroin addict does not say hardly anything and that I can stand. But your Opium “Smoker” is more active since he still has a tent and a Lamp . . . and maybe 7-9-10 lying up in there like hibernating reptiles keep the temperature up to Talking Level: How low the other junkies are “whereas We–WE have this tent and this lamp and this tent and this lamp and this tent and nice and warm in here nice and warm nice and IN HERE and nice and OUTSIDE ITS COLD. . . . ITS COLD OUTSIDE where the dross eaters and the needle boys won’t last two years not six months hardly won’t last stumble bum around and there is no class in them. . . . But WE SIT HERE and never increase the DOSE . . . never-never increase the dose never except TONIGHT is a SPECIAL OCCASION with all the dross eaters and needle boys out there in the cold. . . . And we never eat it never never never eat it. . . . Excuse please while I take a trip to The Source Of Living Drops they all have in pocket and opium pellets shoved up the ass in a finger stall with the Family Jewels and the other shit.Room for one more inside, Sir.”Tedious stuff, purity. Very tedious.

        Grover Norquist – Ugh!How did this clown ever get to the top of the greasy pole of ‘conservative’ policy wonks?Well at least MSNBC loves him:“People are an asset,” Norquist began, “they’re not a liability.”“America’s the richest country in the world; it’s also the most immigrant-friendly country in the world. This is not a coincidence. It’s our history, and it’s what we proved again and again. Those that would choose to change our history and would make us less immigrant-friendly, would also make us less successful, less prosperous, and certainly less American.”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/grover-norquist-now-amnesty-loving-immiAlso Rand Paul &amp; Michael Bloomberg love him:http://reclaimourrepublic.wordpress.com/2014/06/14/danger-rand-paul-joins-grover-norquist-amnesty-effort/Conservatives, on the other hand, aren’t exactly thrilled with Grover:http://michellemalkin.com/2013/10/22/glenn-beck-and-the-gops-grover-norquist-problem-revisited/http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/grover-norquists-ridiculous-pro-amnesty-argument.phphttp://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/dgreenfield/grover-norquist-goes-after-heritage-foundation-over-illegal-alien-amnesty/
