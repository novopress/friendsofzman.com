        Spade, eh? Here’s part of a script that might have aired on the vintage Jack Benny radio (briefly, TV) program. In that era, they could have gotten away with such humor. Today, maybe not so much.
Scene: Jack and Mary in back yard.
Mary: Jack, will you help me plant the new bush?
Jack: Well, Mary, for that job we’ll need a spade.
Mary: A spade?
Jack: [Yells] Rochester!
Rochester: Yes, boss. [joins them]
Jack: Rochester, please bring a shovel from the shed so that we can dig a hole and plant this new bush.

        Naming hurricanes with male names, along with Co-ed Ivies commenced the downfall of America falling into the feminist quagmire with which we suffer today.

        Intelligent Design, which religious groups were putting forward as an alternative to the Standard Model of evolutionary biology, is pretty much a dead letter now;
See how out if it I am, I thought it was evolution that was the dead letter!

            Even if one could prove beyond all doubt that a God was responsible for life, instead of the admittedly improbable billions of years of random chemical mixing and other physical phenomena culminating in evolution/natural selection, Then it’d be a valid question among cheeky scientists, asking where God came from. Fundamentally the problem, at least for determinists, is one of infinite regress.As Monty Python so aptly put it at the finale of “Galaxy Song”:So remember when you’re feeling very small and insecureHow amazingly unlikely is your birthAnd pray that there’s intelligent life somewhere up in space‘Cause there’s bugger all down here on Earth!

                Good post.
I confess bias, but the phrase “uncaused first cause” sums it up nicely, to people (humans), who aren’t God(s).
At the end of the day, it always puzzles me how the nucleic acids “know” how to combine to get certain results. Or how is it that H2O molecules mesh in liquid state, but repel each other when frozen, allowing ice to float and not sink and kill everything below.

Boole was the first to conceive of logic as an algebra.  Wow!

        AI is so helpful:
Hurricanes started being named for men in 1979, when the United States began using both male and female names for storms in the Atlantic basin. The practice of using only female names for hurricanes ended in the late 1970s due to increasing awareness of sexism.
