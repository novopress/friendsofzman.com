        It should be noted that the egalitarianism of modern Christianity is not historical.  It was well understood there would be a hierarchy, even in Heaven(see Dante), and while the rich were called to give to the poor, nowhere did it say everyone had rights to equal amounts of goods, or that people should treat outsiders equally (see Jesus and the Samaritan woman and his comment about dogs).   This makes sense, as Jesus was not stupid, and neither was the Church about the ramifications of such thinking.Read Thomas Paine‚Äôs Age of Reason, who was essentially the Hitchens of his time, and one will realize that it‚Äôs the same rhetoric, and just as wrong as it is today.  The French gave an excellent exhibit A.   The idea that there is a singular, universal reason that everyone could assent to is one of the core poisons of the enlightenment that needs to be eradicated.  While there were several enlightenment philosophers that had incredible insight(Kant, Hume, etc), it doesn‚Äôt take long to start to see glaring holes in their personal worldviews.The oft quoted excerpt from Paul from Galatians, now used to kill all dissent, was to emphasize the openness of salvation for all.  Now it‚Äôs a catch-all for sanctimonious busybodies to wreck Christianity and putting their new, egalitarian religion in its place.The devil knowing the Bible inside and out indeed.

            Paine the Hitchens of his time! I love it! üôÇ May I put in a plug for Deism? This is the belief in a God that created and sustains everything but does not intervene in the affairs of Man in any way. This was an evolution in the Enlightenment‚Äôs changing thought of religion. For all practical purposes it was equal to atheism. This is ‚ÄúGod the Utterly Indifferent‚Äù from (IIRC) Heinlein‚Äôs ‚ÄúStranger in a Strange Land‚Äù.

                    I wasn‚Äôt aware of that one being omitted (but my lack of awareness means little). But for years I wasn‚Äôt even aware there was a 6th verse:
He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave,He is Wisdom to the mighty, He is Succour to the brave,So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of Time His slave,
No doubt that unspeakable S-word. Well, unspeakable unless it‚Äôs used to beat us over the head with our collective guilt.

        Unfortunately that weird cargo cult of universal equality is now firmly entrenched as our ruling principle.  And since it means a denial of racial differences, when blacks under-perform relative to whites, it means whites will exhaust wealth and energy in a hopeless and never-ending effort to bring blacks up to par with whites. It also means the continuing promotion of intermarriage and the continuing dispossession of whites from our home. It never ends, pandemic or not.

        A significant chunk of atheists are at least as fanatical and intractable as a snake-handlin‚Äô, King James Bible totin‚Äô Kentucky Primitive Baptist. They are somewhere in the same category as runners and vegans with assuming everyone wants to know they are atheists and why. Spoiler: we don‚Äôt care.

That said, in the annals of athletic douchebaggery, surely CrossFitters rank above runners. And cyclists. (I was going to say that roadie douchebaggery &gt; off-road douchebaggery, but thinking back on my road and my dirt days, the total shitheadedness was conserved across branches of cycling, it just took different forms. And don‚Äôt get me started on the ‚Äòcross purists‚Ä¶.)

                        Here is Oregon there are only classes of people allowed to ride bikes.  One is hobos and people who‚Äôve lost their licence for repeated DUIs.  You can usually tell these people by their lack of a helmet.  The other is people showing just how devout they are in the climate change religion.  If you work with these people they will make sure to let you know about just how much world-saving they do everyday weaving in and out of traffic.  Some of them help you out if you‚Äôre a little slow by wearing their ultra-tight cycling clothes to work and carrying their helmets around just so you don‚Äôt miss the world-saving.There are also militant cycling groups who are sort of 2 wheeled antifa.  They hold rallies where they deliberately block traffic and just generally act like entitled shits.  These people will have you asking ‚Äúwhere are the Hell‚Äôs Angels when you need them?‚Äù

            In Soviet block during communism although the church and Christian religion were suppressed/marginalized they were not prosecuted to the point of being burned for their heresyOn the other hand  no other dogma was tolerated In Christian domains(Not even other Christian sects)Look what happened to Huguenots in France as an example of fanaticism par excellence

                Heresy? Fromhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church‚ÄúThe sixth sector of the OGPU, led by Yevgeny Tuchkov, began aggressively arresting and executing bishops, priests, and devout worshippers, such as Metropolitan Veniamin in Petrograd in 1922 for refusing to accede to the demand to hand in church valuables (including sacred relics). In the time between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1935, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. Of these, 95,000 were put to death. Many thousands of victims of persecution became recognized in a special canon of saints known as the ‚Äúnew martyrs and confessors of Russia‚Äù.‚Äù

‚ÄúBy the end of the decade, approximately thirty thousand priests had been forced to leave France, and several hundred who did not leave were executed.[26] Most French parishes were left without the services of a priest and deprived of the sacraments. Any non-juring priest faced the guillotine or deportation to French Guiana.[1] By Easter 1794, few of France‚Äôs forty thousand churches remained open; many had been closed, sold, destroyed, or converted to other use

                Not true. Monasteries were closed, many churches were demolished and many priests jailed or to sent to prison camps or forced labor. Only later have the commies realized that keeping a pacified church around helps with pacifying a segment of the populace too.

        A number of prominent thinkers have pointed out the danger of people who want to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you, because they will arrogate to themselves infinite power in their self-righteousness.
But I‚Äôve always thought that they had the psychological causality backwards: namely, that the desire for infinite power comesfirst, and that the infinite number of crusades they cook up are essentially rationalizations after the fact.
Of course egalitarianism is theultimatecrusade to the power-hungry, as it will require infinite power to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù the infinite ‚Äúviolations‚Äù of inequality in nature.

            ‚ÄúOf all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victim may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.

        I‚Äôve always been partial to this quote from TS Eliot which touches upon the same theme:‚ÄúHalf the harm that is done in this world is due to people who want to feel important. They don‚Äôt mean to do harm; but the harm does not interest them. Or they do not see it, or they justify it because they are absorbed in the endless struggle to think well of themselves.‚ÄùYes, the elites were scared, which ramped this way up. But also this was the ‚Äúacademic‚Äôs‚Äù and government ‚Äúexpert‚Äôs‚Äù  time to shine. They never get to do much meaningful in the world but play with their models and theories. This was their time to think well of themselves. And their preoccupation with their own self image‚Äìnot the accuracy and utility of their models‚Äìis what is not allowing them to admit their fallibility and correct the predictions to something more accurate, and thus useful.

            This is something our side does not appreciate very well. Pol Pot really believed he was helping his people. He died with a clear conscience. I doubt very many revolutionaries blinked their last blink wondering if what they did was right. Fanatics are defined by their fanaticism. To question the cause is to question their very existence.

                It seems to me that is why Globohomo has so few defectors in the upper ranks.No matter the destruction visited upon the west they generally believe that for your own good you must be cleansed and if it means grinding you, your familly, your culture and your history into the ground, they are  prepared to make that sacrifice for you.I also wonder if this is also not some short circuit in the erotic zone of the brain as beyond a certain point the virtue signalling seems to have a distinct public orgiastic aspect to it. Maybe its some for of genetic defect in the sexual pleasure circuits aligned into the areas dealing with moral behaviour.

                        Working in that area I am well aware that nearly all social media is (designed?) oriented towards gamification and reward dependency (I know this even as I am typing this on here). The large companies spend a ton on this stuff.I was sort of thinking that as this sort of fanatic behavior always seems to have been with us (far back to the Essenes and before and showing up in waves though history) maybe its a genetic trait that becomes dominant in a population, rises up causes a mass conflict and then those people are killed off and it takes time to get enough numbers again.The erotic aspect I was thinking as it sort of looks similar and is such a strong drive that short circuited into the moral areas would be almost an irresistible force.

                SomethingMOSTpeople do not understand about Judaism or Christianity is that the CreatorNEVERrequired/requires blind obedience. I cannot remember the exact book, chapter and verse but the Jews were commanded to test whether or not what a prophet predicted came to pass. If it did then the prophet‚Äôs message was from the Creator. If not then the prophet spoke presumptively and was a false prophet. In the New Testament, Christians were command to look carefully at what was told them by someone claiming to have a revelation from the Creator to see if it was consistent with what they had already received. One of the 12 Apostles, name of Thomas, refused to believe that the Christ had risen from the dead. When Christ appeared among them that evening rather than rebuke Thomas for not believing, He showed him the nail scars on his hands and offered to show where the Roman soldier‚Äôs spear had pierced His side. The Christ‚Äôs answer to a lack of faith wasEVIDENCE,not a rebuke. The greatest commandment was to ‚ÄúLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.‚Äù

        I‚Äôve heard the theory that monotheism gave rise to fanaticism but didn‚Äôt know it was Haldane‚Äôs. I am no defender of monotheism, I can easily see why it would lead to fanaticism. But I suspect it might be the other way around; ppl did not become fanatics b/c they invented monotheism, they came upon monotheism b/c they wanted to be fanatic about their god. Fanaticism (probably, who really knows this stuff??) comes from an inner void and the need to fill that up. As Hoffer said, if a man‚Äôs business is worth minding, he will mind his own business. Fanatics are mentally incomplete, there‚Äôs a hole they always need to fill. And that‚Äôs what makes them effing impossible to get along with in the long run.

You‚Äôre proving my point. Their cultural mores and values are the same irrespective of whether they believe in god.
And America is built on Magic Dirt theory. Jesus didn‚Äôt exactly save you from the Hart-Celler Act, did he? In fact, Christian organisations are the main motors of the immigration-industrial complex.

                                Felix.  Yes, good insight.  Some of these Christian organizations are pretty good wrt to what they do.  Franklin Graham‚Äôs setup for helping disaster victims puts the Fed‚Äôs to shame.  However, when he collects my donation for say, hurricane relief, he then uses left over funds to help non-Americans all over the world.
Catholic charities as well, especially with their refugee resettlement, also work against my interests.  At this point, my charitable donations extend little farther than local groups in town‚Äîwhere I can visit and see their efforts are not in conflict with my beliefs.

            A lot of atheists get the cause and effect backwards.  They routinely attribute ‚Äúanti-gay‚Äù sentiment to Christianity.  Even if you accept atheist thinking the bible was made up by ignorant goat herders, they obviously already didn‚Äôt like gays. They ignore atheistic atrocities while attributing every atrocity ever committed by a Christian to the religion.Atheists like to pretend that they are above all the human pettiness they ascribe to religion and that widespread atheism will lead to a secular utopia and ignore all evidence to the contrary.

                Which is why atheists have to go back a thousand years to the Crusades, where 1-3 million died in centuries of conflict, to get an example of religious atrocities.  But they ignore Mao and Stalin, who killed between 50-100 million in the 20th century.  Both were avowed atheists who banned religion from their countries, and actively persecuted Christians.  Even the atheistic Chi-Coms of today, when they are not persecuting the religious, kill Falun Gong people because they want to twirl in the parks.

                    Which they then try to blame on the Christians.  The Crusades were mostly defensive in nature and were a response to Muslim atrocities and expansion into Christian areas.
They absolutely hate Christianity. Hatred of Christians and Christianity is what drives these people, not some love of reason.  This is why they are always trying to ascribe all the advances of Christendom to Muslims or foreigners.  Erase Christendom and we are living like the Romans did, at best.

                    Please stop saying Communists are atheists.
The Bolshevik creators and backers of puppets Stalin and Mao were enforcing their religion, the dictate of their God- to kill and enslave the people of Christ, and all other gods.
The conquest religion of the master race must suppress all other gods, and their peoples.
Not atheist at all.Atheists don‚Äôt care.
The greatest trick of the Devil was not that he didn‚Äôt exist, but that he was the Father of the Christ- who fought him!!
Thus, the Constantine state religion was painted with the same bad paint as the Masters.

        Africa is probably unscathed due to demographics: only a tiny fraction of that continent‚Äôs population lives past 60:The poor and stupid will certainly be hit a lot harder in the US. (See Detroit, New York, Milwaukee, New Orleans.) solipsistic and narcissistic as they are, US coloreds are already trying to attribute their ‚Äúdisproportionate impact‚Äù to the usual ‚Äúroot causes‚Äù of racism, redlining, obesity, and so on.Little thought is given to the fact that perhaps this group is suffering disproportionately because it has never really understood the germ theory of disease. While white people largely avoid large gatherings, the vibrant are still beating up innocents in groups, then returning home to grandma (because of course mom and dad are MIA) and inadvertently exposing her to the China virus.

            Well in typical egalitarian fashion, the cure will render millions of people poor and displaced, where they can intersect with all kinds of death vectors. That should help flatten the disparate impact curve.The war on poverty has really ceded ground in this war on virus. So much so that the cure for the virus is more poverty.Ignoring reality at all costs plays well with the single-mindedness of fanaticism. It also allows the solutions of the egalitarian fixers to sow the seeds of the next problem.The equality they solve for always results in more people miserable and likely to suffer and die.Indeed it is a doomsday device, which is why I favor the ‚Äòdeath cult‚Äô label when referencing the progs.They seem intent on ushering in the great leveler of death. While not all deaths are equal, all men become equal in death. And thats close enough for them!

                Always in the background but overlooked is the myriad ways the civilized-developed-White (ok, Euro- and Asian-) world supports the very existence, and more so the material comforts of the real dirt people. If the brains that runs all the machinery disappears, whether due to a disease, politics or simple attrition, the machinery will run for a little while but eventually fail slowly or quickly and spectacularly. Look to any post-colonial African country or black-majority city in the USA and judge for yourself. In science fiction it is usually the savage, most animal-like people who survive. When the latest cycle completes we will learn the benefit we brought our Neolithic brothers turned out to be mostly temporary, and primarily vastly increased their numbers far beyond their learning. What an unhappy day it will be for the billions of Primitives in the 21st century, wondering where the magic has gone but sure it will return if only the proper rituals are performed, just like the 1940s Cargo Cult savages were, wondering when the magic planes and ships would return with their candy and other wondrous treats.

            AAs are more social than most‚Ä¶they dread social isolation much more than whites or Asians, who are perfectly happy on their phones or computers (or books) as opposed to cook-outs.
To put it simply, I think the disease‚Äôs trajectory can be determined by two factors: the latitude of the people and the socialness of the people. If you‚Äôre high-latitude and highly social you‚Äôre hit the hardest. Ergo, Jews in NYC, blacks in Chicago, and Chinese in Seattle had better take more precautions. Japanese in Indonesia, not so much.

            Based on first hand experience (knowing a family that has it), being overweight and diabetic makes this incredibly bad for you. Also if you‚Äôre old on top of that.
Obesity and diabetes runs rampant through the black American community. Not so much in Africa I imagine. And then if the rumors are true about Malaria medicines helping out, that would also help explain things in Africa. Though a lot remains a mystery still. Maybe weather? But then how do you explain New Orleans etc?

            At its most lethal using government stats this virus is just under 3% lethal. With the myriad of other things that will kill you in Africa  the high fertility rate and sketchy data from  there , we‚Äôd never notice.From what I can gather  this diseases does have significantly higher effects  in the US and UK at least on  Asians , Middle Eastern peoples  Blacks and Older Whites.What is scary though is  not only do we have a global depression do to histrionic overreaction to this virus , food exports have basically stopped  and at the same time giant city sized locust plagues are all over East Africa , the Middle East and to a lesser degree South Asia.That is global  chaos in action.The US is a little better off if we can figure out how to get our institutions and logistics working correctly but we are not immune.Mexico for example  depends quiet a bit on remittances and not only are those going to suffer but so is tourism and oil. That nation is dubiously stable at best and many of the legs of its economy are going to get sawed off.

            ‚ÄúChosen‚Äù is the One Weird Trick that the Tribe uses to hack Christians and it still works very well.  That‚Äôs a big reason why I‚Äôm skeptical of Christianity-first political dissidents.  It takes a mighty re-working of the scriptures to un-Choose the Chosen, usually requiring an egaliatarian revolutionary Christ that strikes too many as the Commie version ala Liberation Theology.
TradChristians are on the horns of a dilemma unless and until they take upon themselves the responsibility of reinterpreting scripture and rejecting the dogma that‚Äôs Browning what‚Äôs left of the Church and ultimately killing it.

                Exile, my recent listening and readings of the scripture (this being Lent season), I have been doing so in light of perhaps Christianity being ‚Äúowned‚Äù by the Old Testament people.  That Christianity was perhaps not so much a ‚Äúbreaking away‚Äù or ‚Äúseeing a new light‚Äù as instead a ‚Äúcapture‚Äù, which meshes nicely with your comment.  Give those renegades some rope to hang themselves with‚Ä¶or maybe some nails, pieces of wood and a crown of thorns.Not to say that Christianity has not done a lot of good over the centuries for our kind and ours, but there is this weird ‚Äúelder statesman‚Äù or ‚Äúparental‚Äù vibe when rabbis mix with Christians at certain events.  It all seems of a piece, and for me, once seen, cannot be unseen.

                    Dutch, if I were the guy tasked with ‚Äúde-Judaifying‚Äù Christianity today, I‚Äôd start by demonizing the Old Testament ‚Äì nothing new there, it‚Äôs an old approach.  Make it clear that Christ was a clean break and Jews killed him for it.  As for the universalist rhetoric, we simply de-emphasize it and push it into the realm of far-future theological speculation (e.g. await the Second Coming for that) and/or be Talmudic with the definition of ‚Äúmankind.‚Äù  Lots of ways to skin that goat.It‚Äôs been done before and it can be again, but Christians have to take the first steps on that.

                When they were slapping together the undergirdings of what was to become the Christian Church in the second and third centuries, there was a movement to weave the core teachings of Christ into the Greek Mystery religions instead of the mythology of the shitty little tribe that was stealing and claiming the cultures of actual extant groups who had had coherent cultures for the past couple of millennia.It beggars belief that supposedly sane people believe the crap about, say, wandering around for forty years in a desert about the size of a Walmart parking lot.

General question, not just for Exlie.Is this why the whole ‚ÄúAshkenazi are really Khazars‚Äù thing? So people can continue to venerate the biblical Israelites while hating modern-day Jews? If so, makes little sense to me. So far as I can tell, the biblical Israelites were not at all pleasant people. Certainly not anyone you‚Äôd want to move into your neighborhood.

                    Mike I‚Äôve seen a few variations on that play.  ‚ÄúThe Rebbe‚Äù likes to make the ‚Äúbiblical Temple Jews v. post-Temple Talmud Rabbinical Jews‚Äù distinction.  Many if not most ‚Äúbased‚Äù Christian anti-Semites I‚Äôve seen do something like that or the Kazar shuffle to separate ‚Äúgood‚Äù from ‚Äúbad‚Äù Jews.  As far as I can tell, it‚Äôs all pretty thinly-sourced at best.There‚Äôs a real-world distinction we‚Äôve often noted here between Ashkepaths, Mizrahi and Sephardim, as well as ultra-orthodox, but it‚Äôs an internal Jewish thing.  Poke your under-size nose into that dispute and they‚Äôll lock shields and rain down oy-gevalt on you.We don‚Äôt need any of the Twelve Tribes in our nations and if any are lost, let them stay that way.  Aliyah means goodbye and good riddance.

                Decades ago it started as equality of Opportunity.  As a kid we were taught we should observe equal access to jobs and housing-Rumford Fair Housing. Yet we also saw no one wanted the fat kid on the baseball team for good reason and later we wondered why we didn‚Äôt have freedom of association, why did the neighbors have to rent to that loser and then live next to me. Equal Opportunity morphed rapidly into Equal Outcome and egalitarianism was born.  It was a trope devised by my commie parents‚Äô people to shapshift into the new state religion and quickly brought along the weirdos, freaks, lonely wound-up drunk-cat crap wine wahmyn into the religious fold and gave them zealotry.  It worked.

        If there is anywhere in the world where the herd needs culling, it is Africa.  In our desire to ease suffering, we have used our advanced agricultural techniques to end starvation in Africa and caused a population explosion that the Africans cannot possibly support without a lot of outside help. In our desire to end suffering we just ensured a much larger amount of suffering without indefinite ongoing support.
The kvetching and oy veying about the suffering should we ever stop feeding the Africans will be deafening.

            The Green Revolution was a catastrophe. Population growth is pretty much stagnant everywhere except Africa and the Middle East, and without the Green Revolution the combined population of these two would probably have remained in the low couple hundred millions instead of the current billions.It‚Äôs easy to criticize the Green Revolution in hindsight, though, since it was undertaken at a time when some hunger and malnutrition was still present in the first world.Throughout history, whenever a people outgrew their territory, they migrated into neighboring territory for lebensraum. The Green Revolution, combined with the disorder fomented by the ‚Äúintelligence community‚Äù and NGOs in Africa and west Asia, fueled the current population migrations and will render Europe extinct in a generation or two.

                Let‚Äôs not be too hard on previous generations. Remember this was in the mid-20th century, arguably the pinnacle of Western culture, if not necessarily technology: this was at least for the USA and allies, the recent triumph of the West in WWII, the clear superiority of the Western way, strong in economy and might, etc. There was so much optimism that sober people thought, for example, that other races could be made the equals of the White. Look at all the efforts in Africa to do so in their colonies. Much of this had faded by mid-century, but social movements (civil rights) bloomed in 50s and 60s. Equal opportunity, more, but equal outcomes ‚Ä¶ very few.

                        That‚Äôs an interesting philosophical question now, innit? If big man Obongo subdues his opponents and thus gets first choice of the bushmeat and pombe*, who is the real winner? The lordly Obongo, or his tapeworm? Hmmmm.
*pombe ‚Äì millet beer, as consumed in large swathes of SS Africa. The Wiki page on pombe has a photo of an African man in presumably traditional garb drinking his pombe through a straw. Fine, but for some reason Wiki selected a photo that features a little blonde girl (wearing a string of pearls, yet) in it.

            The thing that brought that home for me was the quote to the effect that Africa was a continent with 100m people that can‚Äôt feed itself and after all the aid from the west is now a continent of 1.5 billion that can‚Äôt feed itself.
If you look at the population projections even earlier this century it was essentially flat from the 12th century until colonialism and then accelerated away due to foreign aid intenvention after that era ended.

            I dearly wish we could divest ourselves of the responsibility to feed and clothe our African wards but, since they will never grow up, I wager that our burden will not be lifted any time soon.It looked for a while as if the white man‚Äôs burden was going to be assumed by the yellow man but I doubt they feel any sense of obligation in this regard.

Trust me, so far as the Chinese are concerned about MENA, sub-Saharan Africa, and Xinjiang, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúSha Hui-ze, sha hou-ze‚Äù (=kill the Muslims, kill the monkeys*). And while there is some respect for Jews being ‚Äúa scholarly people of great antiquity‚Äù (because the Chinese view themselves as a scholarly people of great antiquity), Holocaustianity leaves the Chinaman profoundly unmoved.

        Here is the McHungus Theory of Fanaticism.  The human brain responds to intensity, far more so than sustained elevated rates of feeling.  In fact, under latter conditions, the ability to sense intense feelings is chemically dialed back.  Hence diminishing returns for addicts.  Now look at lab monkeys hitting the bar that (sometimes) dispenses cocaine into their brains 10k, 30k (somewhere in there) between hits.   If given unlimited cocaine, they stop drinking water and eating.A fanatic is a junkie, always chasing that initial ecstatic moment (that made them a fanatic).  Hence the increased violence as time goes on, and purity purges.  the fanatic gets off on killing and isn‚Äôt fussy on who they do.  In fact, killing your colleagues is probably more of a transgressive thrill than killing ‚Äòothers‚Äô.  Especially after you have already killed a bunch of ‚Äòothers‚Äô.

            Alternatively, not ecstasy but pain.  Chasing the relief from pain the first hit gave, or pain not dealt with festering. Pain shrinks consciousness. Fanatics are wretched souls.

        I still maintain that the final cause of our present madness is increased social neuroticism, which I define as fear of potential or hypothetical threats rather those evident or imminent. A virus is tailor-made (heh) to exploit neuroses. In a different age, it would have been ‚Äúevil spirits‚Äù.Neurotics have always been with us, but we have not always given them such attention or influence. Only in the last century, cohencident with the tenure of the 19th Amendment, has our public policy given credence to what we would have once dismissed as literal hysteria.It‚Äôs Woody Allen‚Äôs world.

            Women‚Äôs suffrage was our biggest single misstep and a huge reason why it‚Äôs likely impossible to reform Western democracies under their existing systems.  Once you hand someone power, they don‚Äôt give it back unless you make it worth their while.The ancients rarely left women socially powerless.  They had their own spheres of influence, expertise and power, but like our physical nature, those roles were dimorphic, not a partnership of alleged equals, certainly not a ‚Äúcompetition.‚ÄùWe‚Äôll need to hold out some carrots as well as sticks for wahmens to buy into Our Thing in the necessary numbers to keep us strong, offering them distinct roles where they can exercise bio-culturally appropriate authority in things like child-rearing and some aspects of education, for example.

                I used to believe that men‚Äôs historical leadership role was due to physical strength, and became obsolete when strength became a commodity, and intelligence became the new strength.

        While many atheists do indeed subscribe to the new PC religion of egalitarianism, it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way.
Many of us who reject iron-age myths, look instead to science, as the best means of understanding who we are as human beings, and how we came to be that way.
And science reveals egalitarianism to be every bit as fallacious as religion..

            Science reveals the scientist far more often than it reveals it‚Äôs subject, unfortunately, and increasingly. Belief in science is a religious cult disquised as a belief in science. Like the cult of Darwin, they grasp their prayer beads and cast incantations at unbelievers, especially the scientific ones. Science advances against scientist‚Äìas the man said‚Äìone death at a time.

            I agree with your last sentence, but science will never provide insight on who we are as human beings.  We are ghosts in machines.  Science can rudimentarily explain the physics of the machine.  Understanding the ghost can only come through faith.

        ‚ÄúIn fact, disaster, man-made or natural, is proof that egalitarianism is rooted in our biology, or at least in the biology of some.‚ÄùIn ‚ÄúRighteous Mind,‚Äù Haidt discusses this in the context of how &amp; why our rational faculties developed ‚Äì as tools of persuasion and rhetoric to spur group action and organization, not to ‚Äúfind truth.‚ÄùThe Dunbar-size bands of early man were hierarchical law-of-the-jungle pecking orders, with the baddest dudes usually on top.  However, there were times when competing sub-groups would arise to overthrow Chief Grug the Feckless, Overly-Cruel or Luckless.  The ‚Äúbetas‚Äù of the current order would organize and beer-hall Chief Grug or pillow him using this new rational faculty.In this scenario, the first and best thinkers were dissidents ‚Äì very plausible and also pleasing to our vanity ‚Äì consider me convinced.This rebel impulse, unchecked, leads to the hair-on-fire version of egalitarianism we see today that gets you kicked off Twitter for dead-naming an Otherkin.Fast forward 10k years or so.  I‚Äôll again recommend VDH‚Äôs ‚ÄúWho Killed Homer‚Äù ‚Äì in the early chapters VDH explores the development of the Greek mind-set and worldview and Aristotle‚Äôs praise of the ‚Äúmiddle ones‚Äù as the anchors of the polis.  In VDH‚Äôs mind and mine, the Greeks best blended monarchy, aristocracy and democratic egalitarianism.  Then Rome happened ‚Äì another post there.The Greeks had a means of dealing with disgruntled egalitarians with riot in mind ‚Äì exile or colonization (mass exile with a smile and stipend).Today‚Äôs riotous minds have no such institutionally-recognized option.  But the political wilderness still beckons.  A lot more people will be hearing the call of that wild now that civilization‚Äôs mask of competence, much less public spirit, has slipped.Contra Ben Franklin, America was only briefly a Republic, and we didn‚Äôt keep it.  Functional, balanced egalitarians, those willing to respect hierarchy, but not feckless corruption and exploitation, are looking to the West for new pastures.  Corinth is lost and decadent and our new Syracuse beckons.A lot of priors are on display here lately, damning the ‚Äúdeadbeats‚Äù for wanting That Bag.  We righteously-riotous proles should consider it our colonial stipend.

        Your atheist zealot is, of course, way out there where the buses don‚Äôt run. And you are a step behind as are the folks at the NRO.In the beginning there was God. We lived and died at His whims and word ‚Äì if you won a battle, it was because God favoured you. If you lost, it was because He was punishing you. If you had a plague, it was because you had sinned. There was God‚Äôs Truth and nothing else.That put is in trouble with guys like Galileo and Capernicus who kicked off The Age Of Reason. The problem with that was that men are not rational animals. They are rationalizing animals and the idea that you could be scientifically proven wrong or your enemies being proved right with a simple methodology that only required dispassionate objectivity and logic ‚Äì was insufferable.In the 60‚Äôs, spoiled boomer brats begat the idea of Relative Truth. You can have your Truth, the blacks theirs, the homos theirs, the wahmen theirs and so on. In a nutshell, that is basically what ‚ÄúIntersectionality‚Äù is. Of course that is utter rot; truth is the same here as it is in Africa or Europe or in Antarctica.Unfortunately, the guy in the article IS correct. Our own illustrious leader and trust fund baby ‚Äì Turdo La Doo ‚Äì his wife has it and he was definitely exposed to it so they put him in a bubble and made him a finger puppet in the self-isolation morality play. In Europe, the Black Death hit all the classes pretty much the same. I think this is why we are seeing so much panic in our leaders. The idea that they are biologically the same as dirt people is not sitting well with them.As for the egalitarians, they may survive and still be with us‚Ä¶ or not. When things get tough and we need everything we have just to survive, stupid people will be liabilities we can no longer afford and you can bet they will be dealt with harshly if things go really badly.

                I think you‚Äôll find that most atheists have never even read a bible, much less studied it. I can understand and forgive those that struggle with classical Christian mythology because to be honest, I do too. Most militant atheists that I have seen are rebelling against the hypocrisy, the grift, and the carpet baggers that use and abuse the faith to their own ends. It amuses me that those exact same grifters and psychotic carpet baggers today pose as scientists. They‚Äôre essentially doing to science what their ancestors did to the church ‚Äì undermining it and discrediting it.I look at these guys putting on airs of sophistication and quoting from historic atheists and I just laugh. A critique of the bible demands that you read it and study it for at least a couple years just to get grounded in it. A proper study can consume a life time. Biblical archeology could consume another life time.For me personally, I spent most of my life as an atheist or at least an agnostic and I lived among and grew up among amoral shitlibs and leftwing lunatics. I know how they think and reason, and how the stupidity chambers they set up work. It wasn‚Äôt until I was exiled from the Hive after too many red pills that I discovered my Maker, right under my nose in plain sight. Zealotry is a condition of man, not of God. The bible specifically forbids it too. That was one of the many revolutionary ideas the faith introduced and why it eventually replaced polytheism that that the Greeks and Romans had been practicing. I would further argue that Rome didn‚Äôt reach its pinnacle until the 15th century Renaissance. I‚Äôm sure it will strike most people as purely coincidental that now Europe has abandoned God, they are heading into a steep decline that could very well destroy them and their civilization. I am okay with that.Real Christianity is not about controlling others ‚Äì it‚Äôs about controlling yourself. That‚Äôs why your present civilization initially rose while others fell. I‚Äôd suggest that you might seek a change in reading material before relying on the words of atheists that have personal axes to grind with people that, living or dead‚Ä¶. may or may not represent the faith.

                Are you really so sure of the canard that everything stopped for 1000 years until the Renaissance?  That the Greeks and Romans were advanced societies but the Catholic Church came along and burnt the books, etc?You realize there were several Reformations and Renaissance‚Äôs starting in 11th century at the latest?That there was no ‚Äúscience‚Äù as we know it under the Greeks and Romans?  That the entire methodology evolved from philosophy to natural theology to naturalism starting about the 12th century and took centuries to evolve?Not to mention to call the Royal Academy ‚ÄúProtestant‚Äù is to miss that they were Anglican Catholics?I don‚Äôt know how to tell you all this but the academe of old was well‚Ä¶In person Blogging for the well heeled ‚Äì except when they functioned as;  Think Tanks for Kings and Emperors.The Greeks had philosophy ‚Äì yes.Darlings we call them Think Tanks now.  Those philosophers were engaged in a struggle for Power.Socrates was the movement leader of a planned Aristocratic Revolution to overthrow Democracy, Plato the Military Commander.  The plot was foiled and Socrates killed, ending it.The Romans had engineering and roads, aqueducts, buildings.Yes; they certainly did; we‚Äôd call them variously Halliburton or the US Army Corps of Engineers- Rome in short was a military Empire. That‚Äôs Rome‚Äôs I Love Fucking Science.Rome loved War, and loot.Science built the roads, the siege fortifications.  That‚Äôs Classical ‚ÄúScience‚Äù.Galileo was using the telescope to scout enemy fortifications and had an idea.  The Catholic Church far from suppressing science subjected Galileo to‚Ä¶peer review.Galileo and Copernicus didn‚Äôt screw up anything, anymore than Vincent Cerf and the other Internet Pioneers screwed up networks.  Cerf and others were rejected by Ma Bell (I guess they‚Äôll be the Catholic Church someday and Cerf et al Galileo) as Ma Bell wanted not packet switching but circuit switching for the network.Packet switching won because of the virtues of Vincent Galileo Cerf‚Ä¶Or perhaps Packet switching won because Cerf was at DARPANET and the Pentagon wanted to talk thru a nuclear war.The first packet switched networks were a band of heroic bloggers who‚Ä¶ oh wait, actually it was an X.25 network for launching Americas missiles.In the 90s Al Gore heroically declined to regulate the Internet, allowing an explosion of human knowledge demanding ever better streaming technologies and more bandwidth, faster servers‚Ä¶oh wait; that was porn.By the way circuit switching came back after a fashion, its called Ethernet Fabric, TRILL or whatever.Maybe someday when Christianity is finally fuxing dead the Church will be objectively evaluated and measured.But not until the atheists are done destroying all the social, civilizational and financial capital of the last 2800 years (I‚Äôm going back to Homer).The Church far from suppressing the classics made them a staple of the Churches primary and secondary education; The Trivium and Quadrivium.Here‚Äôs your fucking Dark Ages:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuadriviumYes, clearly suppressing the Classics.Sarc.

        Or the fit. Its possible, even quite likely, that physical fitness (both bodybuilding and aerobic) may be more a determinant of survivability than either being wealthy or intelligent (in the absence of being smart enough to do life-long fitness). Its likely that obesity and just being generally out of shape is the single biggest risk factor for COVID-19?

        For the most part, ecumenical monotheism is a function of Christianity. Therefore, it has been with us a little over 2,000 years rather than 5,000. And this fact destroys Haldane‚Äôs argument inasmuch as there was a great deal of human misery before the advent of Jesus Christ.

            what really invalidates the theory Haldane pulled out of his cat‚Äôs ass, is the fact that people can become fanatical about anything, not specifically religion.  And they can change targets of obsession too.   if you couple a charismatic leader, that evokes the fanatic tendency, with a large group of followers, you are going to be able to overwhelm any group lacking that condition.

                Exactly. That‚Äôs another way of saying what I was saying. Ecumenical monotheism didn‚Äôt exist before Christ, but to say fanaticism didn‚Äôt is preposterous. And, at any rate, fanaticism is hardly a prerequisite for human suffering anyway.

        Christianity of course as the original ‚Äúleftist‚Äù ideology is the one which established the idea of ‚Äúequality‚Äù as well as of ‚Äù making world better place‚Äù perversely tying to the notion of ‚Äúoriginal sin‚Äù and eternal culpabilityIn its essence christian cult is the first universalistic, or in today language the globalist ideologyNeither in Greece nor in Rome any of these ideas existedInhabitants of these domains saw themselves as far above the rest (rightly so). The idea of making the world ‚Äúbetter‚Äù place would be laughed at as were the first Christians arriving in RomeThey were highly amused by these jews preaching the love of the enemy and turning the other cheekRoman burned down Carthage instead of trying to convert itFirst thing Christians did in the new world was to convert the savages to their dogma

            No thinking man would dispute the idea that fanaticism stems from monotheistic religionsLook at Greece and its history of dissent, of different philosophy that existed in relatively short period of historic time and compare that to the fanatic zealots of Christianity and their reign from roughly from 500 to 1500 ADThat period that ends with reformation and renaissance was literally a swamp where no new idea in art or science was born1000 years of absolute christian domination aka dark ages was the age of fanaticism par excellence which western civilization had not known neither before nor after

‚ÄúHow many angels can dance on the head of a pin?‚Äù (alternatively ‚ÄúHow many angels can stand on the point of a pin?‚Äù[1]) is a reductio ad absurdum challenge to medieval scholasticism in general, and its angelology in particular, as represented by figures such as Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas.[2]

                                Fanatic, I‚Äôm largely with you on the things you said above, but the ‚Äúhow many angels‚Äù issue wasn‚Äôt about is it 5, 15 or 33 angels for a given pin. It was really a debate about finite versus transfinite.
My theologically-naive interpretation is that it was trying to address whether there is necessarily a physical aspect to the divine. But I could be FOS on that.

I am not sure the British experience with the Thugees in India, or the human sacrifice cult of the druids that the Romans took such pains to stamp out, or the mass human sacrifice of the various South American cultures really agree with that statement. But I suppose it depends on what you mean by fanatic?

                Or, the Dark Ages were going to be dark regardless of who dominated life after the collapse of Rome. And, without that collapse and the subsequent dark age no enlightenment would have been left space to birth, and born in Chistianity it was. Not in an Islamic one, or Confucian, Hindu or Buddist, or Atheist. As a non-Christian I don‚Äôt feel the need to answer why that is, but facts are stubborn things. Even an Atheist must acknowledge Christianity did not stop the Enlightenment. What the Atheist cannot manage is to acknowledge is that he has ended the Enlightenment.

                Tocqueville‚Äì‚ÄúIt is doubtful whether Socrates and his school had very definite opinions upon what was to happen to man in the afterlife, but the one belief of which they were convinced, namely, that the soul has nothing in common with the body and would survive it, has been enough to give to Platonic philosophy this sort of sublime impetus which is its distinctive feature.On reading Plato, we see that many writers before and during his lifetime anticipated the doctrine of materialism  These writers have not survived to our day or have only partially survived. The same is true for almost allother centuries; most great literary reputations have been linked to spirituality.Whenever among the opinions of a democratic nation you come across some of those evil theories which promote the belief that everything perishes with the body, you may consider men with such views as natural enemies of the people. If their system could be of some use to man, it would be in giving him a modest opinion of himself. But they do not demonstrate such a truth and when they think they have done enough to prove that they are brutish, they seem as proud as if they had demonstrated that they were gods.I doubt whether man can ever support at the same time complete religious independence and entire political freedom and am drawn to the thought that if a man is without faith, he must serve someone and if he is free, he must believe.‚Äù

            Balkan;You are right about one thing, namely that Christianity is radically egalitarian.  But you seem confused about how this works and what it means: To you. Personally.The true equality in Christianity is that all men (&amp; women) are equally born into human sin and depravity and therefore are equally in need of God‚Äôs saving grace, which is equally available to all through accepting Jesus‚Äô atoning sacrifice on the cross.  And only through accepting it.  We all equally can bring nothing to ‚Äòthe unfair exchange.‚Äô  But *anyone* can accept it by bringing an open hand, open heart and ‚Äòbending the knee.‚ÄôThis is The Christian Gospel.  The rest is validation, context, explication and interpretation.Being Easter Week, it is an excellent time to be contemplating this radical equality and avoid wasting mental effort on unimportant second order questions.Most people, myself most definitely included, get stuck on the ‚Äòbending the knee‚Äô part and invent all sorts of reasons and intellectual schemes to avoid doing so, largely due to the sin of pride.  Perversely, the higher the IQ, the more ingenious the intellectual scheme can be.  Don‚Äôt be that guy.

        Haldane is subject to honest critcism, as thezman has actually pointed out, for being the pot that calls the kettle black ‚Äî not necessarily for being wrong about what he posited, in and of itself.  There clearly is at least some overlap between fanaticism arising from monotheistic and fanaticism arising from egalitarianism.Specifically in our current American context, all too many of our intellectuals who have gone unhinged crazy fanatic were born into, raised in, and are steeped in the monotheistic tradition and philosophical world view, in particular the protestant sects that fall within what thezman has referred to as yankee puritanism.  This is every bit as true as those (almost all these days) who are too ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù for believe in God; I would say it‚Äôs especially true of this type in that they are the most like the actual 17th century New England puritan fanatics, in actual words and deeds, and strikingly so.I am aware of this, I know this, simply because I have known and had to deal with too many individuals of this type throughout my life.  And make no mistake about it; this includes National Review types and others of the so-called ‚Äúright‚Äù every bit as much as the coo-coo for co-co puffs D-party lunatics of the ‚Äúresistance‚Äù (and everything in between as well).  They get tiring and tedious.  All of them.  They did a long time ago, and this is why I immediately see this whenever it manifests, which now is all the time, all day every day.  And yes the ones preaching and pontificating on the bad cold that is going around really do want it to be a plague.  Fortunately, they‚Äôre in for a big disappointment, at least this time.And so we‚Äôre left with some combination of monotheism gone off the rails with egalitarianism gone off the rails.  I really don‚Äôt know how large the overlap is and how much of it is of necessity and so always present.  I simply know from too much life experience that the overlap is very real, and specifically identifiable, even though my knowledge is (by definition) anecdotal.  It is very real, and now they all get to apply their very real craft to a bad cold, and one that has somehow erupted/been fanned into a literally psychotic and hysterical panic on a global scale.  It is said that ‚Äúmay you live in interesting times‚Äù is a curse.  Now I understand why.

        Dissidents will get more of what we tolerate. Let the delusional operate on their own dime and their own time. We are better served by insulating ourselves from their psychosis.

        Even though I think he is a closet Papist üôÇ Zman correct faults the atheist (indeed, the comment can apply more broadly‚Ä¶) who says that if everyone could drop their silly faith in the supernatural, they would learn to think rationally. The goal is correct up to a point, but I critique it thusly: The hidden (wrong) assumption in the atheist imagines is that people  think in two distinct ways: either they are mindless believers in the invisible guy in the sky OR they are cold-blooded rationalists that would do Spock proud. This is (probably) fallacy of the false dichotomy. The dream of Randian idealists for a perfect world ruled by clear thinking and scientific achievement (this idealism, the 1950s dream of progress, was artfully showcased in the words of Donald Fagen‚Äôs 1982 album ‚ÄúThe Nightfly‚Äù) is the faith that all human irrationality would vanish; Their envisioned utopia is only a trace less ludicrous and out of reach than the competing phantasmagoric heavens of normal religions.In one sense the argument is correct, that you have the choice to think rationally or not-rationally. But the separation is not all-or-nothing. There is an infinite gradation (mixing) of those two things. For example, consider intuition or instinct.Furthermore, the ‚Äúnon-rational‚Äù area is very large, and contains certainly more than religious belief. Counter-example: hmmm‚Ä¶.here‚Äôs a poor attempt. I can be atheist (disbelieve there is a god) but still believe that my cats are super-intelligent beings who secretly spy on me and report back to their home planet‚Ä¶Atheism gets a bad rap. If you think about it, its main fault is a dogmatic assertion that at bottom is just as unprovable as the contrary assertion of the Theist. What IS apparent is the danger that dogma can cause, fanaticism at the extreme leads to Martyr. If someone is willing to die for his faith, that is his choice. I object when he damages others in the process. Finally, just because you‚Äôre officially Atheist, doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt be a de-facto religion and cause the deaths of millions. Soviet communism is a good example, probably not the only one. And, according to my ‚ÄúCliff notes‚Äù knowledge of history, there were a lot of willing volunteers who went to their deaths, so genuine faith or successful indoctrination by the power?

                    Amusing, but really a typical spell checker error that often goes unnoticed.  Whatever is going on here with my iPad spell checker and the blog, I get at least half a dozen such in any posting and need to go back to or react after reread.  Indeed, I didn‚Äôt even know what you were referring to and had to reread Apex‚Äôs comment closely.  I corrected it in my mind and noticed nothing.

                Predator, you know exactly jackSHITabout me aside from the fact that I am bold enough to use myown nameinstead of cravenly hiding behind a nom-de-net like so manybravenet warriors here. I asked the host a question because I had a question about somethingHEwrote. I don‚Äôt dodeep seated underlying psychologyor other such nit noy bullshit! I ask simple direct questions couched in simple direct language precisely as I was taught in Air Force Effective Writing back around 1975 or so.For the record, I respect the ZManFAR TOO MUCHto believe that he needs the assistance of double-digit-IQ bozos to answer a simple question. I stated the context of my query clearly ‚Äì i.e.When Jefferson wrote those words, It was much harder to bring an accusation against a rich man (or his progeny) or a titled man than it was a ‚Äúcommoner‚ÄùI am well aware that a rich man has a greater likelihood of obtaining a favorable (to him) outcome in a court of law. My question was whether the ZMan believes that such differences ought rightly to be codified in American law. Whether the law fekkingOUGHT TO BEcognizant of a person‚Äôs social or economic status when said person appears before the bar ofjustice.Now will you nitwits kindly STFU and let the ZMan answer an honest question?Oh, and for the record, I read ZippyCatholic‚Äôs little piece. Obviously, no two people standing before a judge are going to be entirely equal. One of them ‚Äì ostensibly -is in the right while the other is not. My question revolves around whether one‚Äôs socio-political-economic standingSHOULD/OUGHT TOhave any bearing on who is right. I thought courtsWERE SUPPOSED TOdecide things upon the basis of objectiveFACTand not which side of town one of the litigants grew up/lives in. Geez Louise! Can‚Äôt we at least be civil here? Or do we all have to march in lockstep? Is one not allowed to ask questions of the all-wise guru?

                Thank you. I share that belief and it seemed to me that the ZMan was saying the exact opposite so I stupidly asked for clarification. I suppose around here one is not allowed to question the ZMan.

            Yeah, Rachel Jeantel is the epitome of ‚Äúequal before the law.‚Äù  Ohnoes, you‚Äôll reply, that‚Äôs not what you mean.  But itiswhat you will get with your blanket statement.  No, we are not equal in any way nor should we be ‚Äòequal‚Äô before some presumed law.  What you‚Äôre looking for is perfect fairness which is found nowhere in nature.  You‚Äôre presuming some jury made up of some racial and/or IQ level mixture can rationally and fairly and impartially determine justice.  Democracy and equality ‚Äì both are massive lives and massive failures.

        In some bizarre way I see a Jeffrey Epstein tie to this virus madness.  The Epstein suicide was perceived by a huge swath of people, regardless of politics, to be a hit job by the wealthiest .001% on a guy in a prison cell who had the goods on them.  While this can‚Äôt be dismissed outright, a critical thinker would say that there‚Äôs a higher likelihood that a degenerate pervert, who lived most of his life in pleasure palaces, couldn‚Äôt take prison for even one day, and through an incompetent bureaucracy, was indeed able to off himself. The cameras likely hardly ever worked, as it was government equipment, just like if you have to use a drinking fountain in a public building that trickles into the drain without streaming.   Fast forward to today, a huge swath of public being alarmed by a failed bureaucracy on a flu, goes into a panic.  We‚Äôre told not to question Fauci because he‚Äôs been in charge of the NIH since 1984!  The tenure alone is supposed to speak to competence, when the opposite is true. Anyone who parks himself in a job like that since The A Team was on TV, as a lord of official nationwide health (as the opioid epidemic raged under his watch) suddenly gets a hold of sweet power, and his sleepy, incompetent agency swings into action like a bunch of Barney Fifes handling a gun.  This is something that should have given us pause.  Instead we inhaled his BS, and now the suicides alone from ruined business owners will crush that virus stats.  The country is almost completely devoid of critical thinking skills.

            Okay, the cameras hardly ever worked because incompetence.  Okay, the guards were incompetently absent.  Okay, the whatsis bone in Epstein‚Äôs throat was broken consistent with homicidal strangulation because he was an incompetent suicider.  Okay, Epstein‚Äôs jailhouse companion swears Epstein was not depressed, but the companion was incompetently empathetic.  How many coincidental incompetencies would it take to make you go ‚Äúhmm‚Äù?

        I think the central tenent of atheism is to hijack every gol-dang thread so they can talk about the gol-dang flying spaghetti monster. Similar disease afflicts vegetarians, dunno why.Junger is an interesting case. I read his ‚ÄúTribe‚Äù book, which suffered, iirc, from the Rusty Reno problem of being able perceptively to identify and catalogue a problem and then recommend absurd non-solutions to it. In that case, when discussing the suicide of veterans, he identifies the lack of tribe for these men as a cause and recommends creating fake tribes for them.There is a kind of conservative mentality that wants to unravel half the sweater.

            ‚ÄúSimilar disease afflicts vegetarians, dunno why.‚ÄùIn case that wasn‚Äôt rhetorical, I suspect deep underlying insecurity about their own choices. The constant talking about it and belittling others who do not share their position is really to reassure themselves, not to convince others. In the same vein, I know some deeply religious persons (for whom I have great personal respect even though I personally have zero religiosity), and none of them go about asking ‚ÄúDo you believe in God [or whatever]?‚Äù They are secure in their faith. And good for them.I don‚Äôt go around asking people ‚ÄúDo you believe in gravity?‚Äù FFS. As to being personally without religious impulse, I suspect it‚Äôs like colorblindness or tone-deafness on my part, given how incredibly prevalent religiosity is.

                    Personally, I have always thought Star Wars was a dumbed-down Dune; a simplified, cannabis induced plagiarism. Think about it: Desert planet, Galactic Empire, chosen savior of the universe, Force replaces Spice, which probably seemed too‚Ä¶ah, mercantile.

        Z you might want to read ‚ÄúDominion‚Äù by honest yet professed atheist Tom Holland.  Summary; Christianity and it‚Äôs  radical idea that we all are made in the image and likeness of God ‚Äì and hence are not meat to be sold at market, or summed into quant spreadsheets, etc ‚Äì this is Christianity.   Admittedly shorn of that pesky Sky God to hold us to account, but (Post Christ) Christianity nonetheless.  There are reasons beyond spite the gays for instance relentlessly pursue the Church for its blessing.   His case is comprehensive and persuasive.Your quarrel here begins with Pope Hildebrand, your quarrel begins with Canossa.End HollandMe.  &gt;&gt;Its really that like software that has lost the sysadmin still executing the script.As far as our elites they‚Äôre proving daily that the insane are incompetent.They‚Äôre also evil, child sociopaths.Our elites are Quimby from Lolita.They gotta go, and don‚Äôt blame NR or anyone who wants to avoid the tumbrels.As far as the leveling virus; you‚Äôre right so far ‚Äì this is leveling economically not just the commons but the healthy.(Its also culling Chinatowns, for instance Elmhurst in Queens.  But don‚Äôt say it aloud).Diversity as cult is headed for late term abortion moral status.  Rare, dangerous, despised, but barely legal.^Yes I know that‚Äôs not happening right now.

        The Haldanes were an interesting clan.  A few examples:‚Äúas the biologist J. B. S. Haldane once famously observed: ‚ÄúThe universe is not only queerer than we suppose; it is queerer than we can suppose.‚ÄùJack Haldane was the genius son of the brilliant scientist John Scott Haldane.  ‚ÄúAt the age of three, he was overheard demanding peevishly of his father : ‚ÄòBut is it oxyhaemoglobin or carboxyhaemoglobin ?‚Äô ‚Äú.  He went on to become the world‚Äôs expert on depression chambers for submariners and divers. [YMMV ‚Äì the three-year-old part sounds like sheep-sh*t to me]‚Äï Bill Bryson, A Short History of Nearly EverythingFrom age eight he [Jack] worked with his father in their home laboratory where he experienced his first self-experimentation, the method he would later be famous for. He and his father became their own ‚Äúhuman guinea pigs‚Äù, such as in their investigation on the effects of poison gases.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._HaldaneSkin in the game.JBS also claimed descent from Robert the Bruce ‚Äì what True Scotsman doesn‚Äôt?

        Does not egalitarianism and universalism share the same need? Dostoevsky made this declaration about universalism‚Äì‚ÄúMankind as a whole has always striven to organize a universal state. There have been many great nations with great histories, but the more highly they were developed the more unhappy they were, for they felt more acutely than other people the craving for world-wide union. Even the great conquerors, Timors and Ghenghis-Khans, whirled like hurricanes over the face of the earth trying to subdue its people, and they too were but unconscious expressions of the same craving for universal unity.‚ÄùSo Universalism is inborn. The tribe over the hill should be the same as ours because the dissimilar is a threat. Equality however has it‚Äôs virtues and does not become a pathogen until it is as one with democracy.

        There is one impetus for every religion, the regulation of sexual activity. All other aspects of any one religion are simply complications. The hereafter and immortality? Muslims, for instance, include an eternity of group sex for the true believer.Just as the state isn‚Äôt satisfied to steal wealth, insisting on outlining the legitimate parameters of all behavior, so it is with religion. Allowing the priesthood and its defenders to have the choice of nubile females is their foremost perogative. They also determine the rest of the social and economic relationships. The atheists reject this supernatural structure and currently replace it with some egalitarian form of government, democracy in particular, which is also a religion, designed to regulate our behavior in a manner more suited to the perceived advancements of science, although there really is no possible science where human behavior is involved.

        Sorry, this post is not as coherent as usual.  Be that as it may, Haladane (and Zman) are going to have to work a lot smarter to displace Hoffer‚Äôs model of fanaticism.  In fact, I find it very suspicious that Hoffer‚Äôs name was left out of this post.
Zman, what are your thoughts on ‚ÄúThe True Believer‚Äù?  Which Archetype are you?

            I‚Äôve addressed this so many times at this point, I hardly feel it is worth it. Hoffer made many great observations about belief. To think he is the final word on the topic is a form of fanaticism I do not share.

                        There‚Äôs also a huge difference between *casual* models which attempt to imprecisely model some real process, and probabilistic models which don‚Äôt even bother trying. The second kind are far more suspect than the first.

                    What i like about TB is Hoffer lays out a comprehensive analysis of charismatic movements ‚Äî and how all the different types (archetypes) of personality fit into the overall framework.  The fanatic is only one component, and is only useful in the initial phase of the movement.  It‚Äôs the founder of the movement that defines its nature, and the fanatics follow on after him.

        The conspiracy-theorist is another stripe of fanatic. Once a man takes a draft of the conspiracy brew, no amount of reason or evidence can reach him. Even dialogue is futile.Religion, like energy is never destroyed, it merely changes form. What the True Believer really fears is that the world is chaotic and random and that nobody is in control. So they seek assurance that there is a plan, there is order. If God is not up there pulling the strings, then it must be the illuminati. Someone MUST be pulling them.Many people find it hard to live with randomness and uncertainty. They must have answers. There must be a plan. This cannot be all there is.

            King Tut ‚Äì In the past I would have agreed with you.  My husband still trots out the old ‚ÄúNever attribute to malice‚Äù line (this covid panic and the plethora of evidence that it has been deliberately exacerbated has him a lot more skeptical of everything than before).  While I can agree there are some who feel a deep need to have everything being due to order or string pullers, I think that leaves a lot of folks out.  I was the original conspiracy skeptic going back to grade school, and my experience with the State Dept. only reinforced the sense that ‚Äúthese people are too stupid to have organized ‚Äòx‚Äô hoax.‚Äù  But the last decade or so, with all the info that has come out, I am far more open to believing all sorts of things were hoaxes or deliberate and there have been (((certain))) string pullers behind a ton of historical events.  I still believe the moon landing happened, but at this point, given another decade, who knows?

It is flattering that you elevate atheists to arbiters of the ultimate questions, but just because I can‚Äôt explain life, the universe, and everything, doesn‚Äôt mean your Bronze Age explanation is true.

                            I still like the philosophical issue of first cause, it may have other names, but the problem is simply that you can‚Äôt define the first cause. Taking the origin of the universe, the Theist would say God created it and He always existed, etc. But this violates the fundamental rule of cause and effect. A perfectly rational question then is ‚ÄúWhere did God come from?‚Äù The debate will always rage on because we are at a draw: The believers can‚Äôt prove their God exists and the unbelievers can‚Äôt prove where this stuff came from üôÇ

I can respect agnostics.  But atheists display a condescension from the sidelines, while exhibiting the same certainty they mock.As for evidence, sometimes in science we prove something that we cannot see exists by the reaction to it.  I cannot prove you once had Covid-19, but if you have the antibodies, that is pretty good evidence.  I cannot show you God under a microscope.  But we have billions of data points of people who strongly believe.  It‚Äôs not scientific certainty, but science would also not discard that much data.

                                    Any postulate absent of proof is a faith based belief.
Atheism is therefore a faith based belief as it cannot provide a rational and provable explanation for the universe and life that precludes the existence of a God or gods. The onus of evidence is on both sides otherwise it‚Äôs a 50-50 push. Nice try at punting though.

                                        Any postulate absent of proof is a faith based belief.
Atheism is therefore a faith based belief
Hence the Santa-argument: does not believing in Santa constitute a religion?
The onus of evidence is on both sides otherwise it‚Äôs a 50-50 push.
Oh, you‚Äôre agnostic about Santa, then? It‚Äôs 50/50, since you can‚Äôt prove he doesn‚Äôt exist?

                                If God were to be infinite at least as Christian theology holds, then God can have no beginning nor end and then time cannot exist for this deity. Nor can God exist within this universe as much as the universe exists within God as infinity would also suppose infinite dimensions.

The relentless, omnipresent Force of binding, one of the five fundamental forces of Creation: the weak nuclear force.
We can put a Face on it, because that is how we frame our understanding.

It needs gravity to guide it. But what is gravity, why is it, and how does it act on water?
Like all the fundamental forces, the fact that gravity exists and works is obvious, but we have only rough, incomplete mathematical models for how it works. Nobody has ever detected a graviton and in fact there is no complete theory for how gravity works.

                            I‚Äôm a reluctant atheist.  I‚Äôll take the Jesus crowd over the atheists any day of the week.  Globohomo is entirely atheistic. Equality is atheistic. SJWs are mostly atheistic.  Hell, the downfall of the churches is largely down to atheistic SJWs infecting them.Most of the evil we oppose comes from the atheists. Just take a look at humanism, which comes directly from atheism.The atheist crowd flat out lies about religion and the religious (Christians). Of course, the atheists are absolute COWARDS at heart, which is why they cannot stand up to the muzzies. They use the courts to mess with Christians, while allowing muzzies to do anything they want. They want to arrest Christian parents for not going along with LGBT stuff in the schools but IMMEDIATELY capitulate to the muzzies when they oppose it.Secularism is not going to lead to a rational utopia, it is ultimately going to lead to us being crushed by Muslims.And, of course, the tribe is behind the atheist movements in the West and in America especially. It was them that got religion kicked out of the schools and ushered in the ‚Äúsexual revolution‚ÄùDissidents need to pick a side. You are either with the normal people or you are with the tribe and the atheists.

                                    I have no idea how many of the soldiers fighting for the SU were atheists, but I am guessing very few. This was only a short time after the Soviets came to power and most of them had a very miserable existence under it up until this time period. Most Soviets did not even have a radio in those days. Most didn‚Äôt even have power. They were fighting a pretty brutal occupation of their homes too.  I really don‚Äôt see the point either way.It isn‚Äôt a dichotomy. We just don‚Äôt need rabid atheists trying to further fracture an already heavily fractured people.  It is also not a false dichotomy to notice that most of our enemies are atheists. That isn‚Äôt saying atheists are therefor our enemies.I also think there is a distinction between people who happen to be atheistic and people who have an identity as being an atheist.  It is mostly the latter who tend to be leftist SJW types. Atheism makes for a really shitty identity. It is just not up to the job in the same way Christianity is.I am not defending ‚Äúreligion,‚Äù I am defending Christianity. I could not care less about Muslims or Jews or their religions.  If a secular Jew is on my side, so be it. The vast majority of secular Jews are not on our side and actively oppose us.  If the secular Jew wants to go sow discord among his fellows, I‚Äôll be cheering him on.If only there were more Thomas Sowells to go around, we could all have one of them for a neighbor‚Ä¶. We could launch our own Sowell real  estate and help the suburban areas in the country import the Sowell to use a human shield against accusations of failure to be inclusive enough.

                                    The huge number of Soviet citizens who fought and died in WW II were fanatical in support of mother Russia,and most likely atheist.
No way. The average Soviet was an Orthodox Christian who understood it was best to not be too vocal about such things. Orthodox Christianity came out of the closet in former Soviet states as soon as it was safe to do so.

                                    Ben;Besides the vicious coercion that was a central feature of the Red Army, there were the atavistic elements of manhood as motivators that the Commies successfully appealed to.  Many studies over the years have shown that men in actual combat mainly fight on for their immediate buddies survival first, and then for honor among their family/tribe members, second.  Ideology divorced from honor from your primary reference group is way down the list.Females in the military beak this age-old dynamic up by introducing squad level competition for sex through protection of your particular ‚Äòsqueeze of the day‚Äô.  That‚Äôs *why* soft Marxists/Feminists insisted on it just as soon as their ‚Äòpaladin‚Äô, Bill Clinton assumed power in 1993.  They *hated* the military and sought its destruction.The primitive power they actually used for subversion had nothing to do with the ideology they employed to justify it.

                                Dissidents need to pick a side. You are either with the normal people or you are with the tribe and the atheists.This is basically it.  I know that saying ‚Äúthis is war‚Äù is passe now because everything is a war.  When I make a turkey sandwich I‚Äôm fighting ‚Äúthe war on hunger‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶ Anyway, this struggle against the egalitarians IS war and it‚Äôs a big one and it‚Äôs global.  You might even call it a kind of slow cooker WWIII.  Big wars always mean alliances, often of people who don‚Äôt share much in common except a hatred of The Enemy.  Well, there do need tosomecommon goals but they can be a pretty small set.  Let‚Äôs also not forget that we can all kill each other later after globohomo is gone too.  Nervous chuckle on that one.Stupid feminists in Europe can form alliances with Arab men who plan to rape them.  American Jews don‚Äôt much care for blacks but join coalitions with them all the time.  Surely dissident atheists can sing a few rounds of Frosty the Snowman to give glory to Santa and his little elf sweatshop up there on the sea ice.  I know I will.

                                    Pozy, feminists and Muslims, blacks and Jews as real wartime coalitions will last about a week so those coalitions should be a huge benefit for us. They will slaughter each other.
As far as dissidents some of whom are Christian and some not, in the prior world some were left or right, whatever. I think and hope we can stick together through possible war time and after.
The way I see it there are few basic absolutes and we should be able to agree to disagree on the rest. Our survival is what is crucial.

If Hitler, Mao, and Pol Pot all ate cornflakes, would you then be posting your hate for the flake and preference for weet bix?Cornflakes have nothing to do with it right? Like Felix has repeated, being an atheist is someone who does not believe in religion due to a lack of evidence. It DOES NOT MEAN an atheist cannot determine right actions, or broken systems, ignorance, or mass corruption as we see in evidence in America atm.Nor does it mean an atheist cannot be an upstanding citizen, without being in thrall to victimhood culture and other leftist contagion.It is basic logic to which many of you strangely struggle with.

                Most atheists are Progressives, and Progressivism definitely is a religion, an especially fanatical one because no heaven up in the sky means they have to create heaven down here.
I doubt there‚Äôs any god or afterlife, but Progressivism is profoundly retarded, and getting stupider every day. They think a man becomes a woman when he puts on a dress, and they call such nonsense ‚Äúscience‚Äù!

                The only ‚Äútenet‚Äù of atheism is the necessity that evidence must precede persuasion.  Otherwise intelligent people generally take this for granted but for the monumental exception given to religious belief.  The last 10,000 years have yet to advance any form of religious belief to the status of hypothesis.

Also I think those people are atheists because they are egalitarians.  A supreme being responsible for the existence of everything is the most anti-egalitarian concept ever.
Finally, the question of a god or no god is so fundamental that there are a ton of implications attached to either answer.

Yes, and I studiously did not comment on his charming characterization of atheists.
But my OP was about Z‚Äôs definition of atheism, not whether Santa is real or not. It does not follow from atheism, that mankind will be driven by reason or that people would stop being preachy about their convictions.

Only if you‚Äôre religious.

                    Just one of those implications is that atheism either necessitates belief in spontaneous generation which Pasteur disproved back in the 19th century or something fanciful like aliens seeding life on Earth.

Atheism necessitate nothing except not being superstitious. Whether you believe in the Big Bang or not, is a separate issue.

For me, the great contradiction is that there is One God.Or that the gods have anything to do with Creation.
Who sez?Why are they more vested in semantics than exploration?

                            Denying the existence of a creator leaves you with only those 2 possibilities regardless of whether or not you want to accept one of them.
The fact is that spontaneous generation was disproved and believing in aliens is no better than believing in a god and ultimately only pushes the problem back.
If you want be an atheist and claim to be logical, you ought examine the logical results of your starting premise .

            Yeah and the only tenant of libertarianism is the NAP, right?The whole reason all of these atheist fanatic organizations exist is to spread atheism (and use their (((fellows)))) in the courts to crush Christianity) in the hopes of a secular utopia where members of the tribe are full members of the European family.

            I presume that Felix, like myself, rejects both egalitarianism and theism.  Those of us that fall into both of these intellectual categories appear to be quite rare throughout the history of Homo sapiens.  It has proven to be a constant source of discouragement throughout my life that adherence to one usually precludes the other.  The rationality that naturally leads to the conclusion that egalitarianism is empirically false would seem to result in the same conclusion regarding any flavor of theism.  Alas, most humans seem biologically predetermined to embrace some form of belief that cannot be derived from evidence.  The logical inference from this post is that the Zman, for all his intellectual prowess, is not immune to this perennial human failing.
