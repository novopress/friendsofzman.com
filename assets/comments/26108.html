        It‚Äôs just horrible. But‚Ä¶ if a mob set Nancy Pelosi on fire‚Ä¶ it would make my day. If Elizabeth Warren fell down 32 flights of stairs, rolled out into the street and got run over by a steam roller‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd buy a round for the house! If an anvil fell on Barkie Obutthole‚Ä¶üòÇüëçBut wishing harm on someone tempts the gods and with that karmic wheel‚Ä¶ what goes around, comes around ‚Äì at least for Dirt People. When a country purges its Cloud People en masse‚Ä¶ really bad things tend to happen. I dunno if it‚Äôs the purging, or the momentum from years of bad management that does it.I know the Clouds hate me and want me dead‚Ä¶ but I just can‚Äôt help starting to feel the same way about them.

                They love our hate because it is a signal to them they are doing something right.
Indifference and mockery to their schemes are the most potent weapons.

        Rapid technological change improves the utility of genius, good or evil genius doesn‚Äôt matter. You just want Napoleon on your side. Republican (oligarchic) government saw its modern golden age when technological revolution was the norm.Democratic (monarchic) government, rule of random guys born into the nobility, is better when technological change is slow. No one wants a Napoleon at that point. The catch is, we now have slow technological change because we are already so advanced, so we now need to figure out how a neo-monarchy would function.North Korea without the crushing sanctions and the worst geopolitical position in history (trapped between China, Russia, and Western influence) is our closest model for where we need to go. South Korea and its demographic implosion is the other way, and a warning of what not to do. Don‚Äôt get so rich you can afford feminism. The oligarchs and their wealth machines at some point aren‚Äôt as good as a traditional ruling family.We always find out the traditionalist Catholics were right about everything, eventually‚Ä¶

            The NORKS have below replacement fertility though not as bad as ours.
If its underestimated , it may be around replacement but its still unwise to be on the verge of famine too.

        If we enter a hyper inflationary period in 2022, that‚Äôs nooses and pitchforks for the Government Party.  Producer Prices were up 9.6% YoY in November, and will easily break 10% soon if not already.  Food price inflation is bonkers in meats, and WSJ reported today that Heinz is warning suppliers to expect 5-20% increases on common food items like the American staple Mac n Cheese.
Soaring inflation is a sure trigger for social unrest.  Especially for staples like bread or Mac n cheese.
Just ask Louis XVI‚Ä¶

        I was sure that after 9/11 there would at least be a pause of some kind pause in immigration, while the government figured out who was here, who was not supposed to be here, and in general made tighter borders and interior enforcement something of a priority. If for no other reason than to show the public something was being done. But nope, none of that happened.And it‚Äôs not like the ruling elite were untouched by the event. Barbara Olson was killed in the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, and she was the wife of Ted Olson, a high profile DC attorney and at the time Solicitor General. Not exactly peons.So obviously open borders and displacement of legacy Americans is an important project of the ruling elite, maybe their most important one. Barbara Olson was unfortunate enough to have to ‚Äútake one for the team.‚Äù

            Barabara Olsen is a minor figure, and at best could be claimed as a member of the ‚Äúouter party‚ÄùThe true targets of the death jabs, could in fact be, the over-produced aspiring elites.  They follow all the rules and orders in order have a shot at moving up the ladder.They need to be eliminated because when the economy implodes this over educated class will represent the biggest threat to the inner party.If a whole bunch of proles refuse the death jab , it doesn‚Äôt really matter.  Although the proles are resistant to propaganda, they generally don‚Äôt have the initiative and intelligence to organize a revolution.

        to all the kiddies questioning whether polio existed:
1. polio existed, and it wasn‚Äôt DDT because people still get polio (but DDT has been banned like 60 years)2. smallpox existed3. the black plaque existed4. influenza existed5. AIDS exists6. coof exists (it just isn‚Äôt that lethal as reported)
why not do a little reading before posting ‚Äútheories‚Äù you pulled out of your ass?

            I think I‚Äôm the one that started the polio conversation on this thread.I in fact, said that it was a real disease that did paralyze people.  But that the hysteria surrounding it was entirely media driven.Some googling led to to the claim that 1952 was the height of the epidemic.  In that year there were 57,000 confirmed diagnoses, 3,000 deaths and 23,000 cases of paralysis ‚Äì temporary to persistent.Out of a total US population of 157,000,000.  So approx 1 in 3,000 people had a confirmed diagnoses and half of those had a serious health impact.So yeah, I‚Äôd call that media drive hysteria.As a point of comparison, the same year 36,000 people died from automobile accidents in the US and approx ten times that number suffered serious injuries.  That works out to 12 times as many as died from polio and 15+ times as many serious injuries.

        The ice age farmer on YouTube has been warning that the WEf was planning a famine for us all. for a while , and the price farmers get for livestock has fallen even as meat prices rose 50% . that may be the bridge too far that cayuses the elites  too much trouble to let it go any further. clearly they Chinese believe its coming ,the are sitting on HALF the worlds total grain supply.https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/china-panic-hoards-half-worlds-grain-supply-amid-threats-global-collapse. since they have 18 percent of the worlds population , that means the lower  classes everywhere are going to face enormous hardship .   russia has bans and limits on exporting wheat,https://www.uswheat.org/wheatletter/russian-wheat-export-controls-they-are-at-it-again/get out of your 401K, buy farmland . it will be ugly before the elites finally decide they have to act.cue DR. Karl to tell me the Chinese couldn‚Äôt possibly be doing this because they are not nice to their people.

            miforest:  I take what I read at Ice Age Farmer with a grain of salt, just as I take everything else.  I also don‚Äôt trust any government numbers ‚Äì not our own, and certainly not China‚Äôs.  Fwiw, there is plenty of food on the shelves of the stores here in DFW, although occasionally missing or skimpy supplies of certain items.  I noted a few small rib roasts at one store ‚Äì they had been on sale before Christmas (1 per customer with an additional $30 purchase) for $4.99 a pound.  Now they want $14.99 a pound.  We‚Äôll see if they sell them ‚Äì even if they mark them down to half price by their Friday sell-by date, I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre worth $7.50 a pound.   And, as you note, the ranchers aren‚Äôt making all that money on the meat, and neither is the grocery store.  It‚Äôs the meat processors and distributors.

                Retail markups are 100%-300%.With a few loss leader items at a substantially lower rate on sales.
So yeah, the grocery chain is capturing most of the price paid by consumers.  They‚Äôve got to pay for their prime real estate, employees, electricity and insurance some how.

        Fauci backing down on the quarantine period (10 days to five and maybe even three) and Biden backing down on a national lockdown mandate is evidence that business leaders have had enough. They got rid of Trump, now it is supposed to be business as usual. There is also the risk of people just ignoring lockdowns. The problem is that the Lockdown Karens are going nuts. China has locked down the city of Xian for no apparent reason, France is locked down. Australia. Austria. NYC is locked down and having big protests, arrests. An ex Raiders cheerleader, now a real estate bimbo went nuts on a Delta flight and beat up an 80 year old man for not wearing a mask while eating.I just heard on the radio the head of the Salvation Army apologize for his wokeness and deny that the Salvation Army adheres to a social dogma or wants people to apologize for their skin color. Remarkable as this story never hit the media, only conservative websites. And of course LA is being hit with various wealthy people targeted. Jacqueline Avant, wife of a billionaire and the mother in law of Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandros, was killed by an aspiring rapper / home invader (who managed to also shoot himself in the foot). The Piv, Jeremy Piven, was robbed in a home invasion, as was a Real Housewife and various B listers. Now Chief Heap Big Fake Indian, Elizabeth Warren, wants the SEC to essentially stop Wall Street from funding: the auto industry including Ford, GM, Toyota, whatever Chrysler calls itself today, all real estate including commercial real estate, all petroleum and coal and gas extraction, all mining, all forestry, all of it. As Dems are scheming to not seat Republicans for ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù (i.e. they are Republican) and using the DC National Guard (Biden signed a bill making them under the command of the DC Chief of Police) to arrest the entire Republican slate in Congress for ‚Äúinsurrection.‚Äù It would not shock me to see this after the mid-terms and the Military just installing ‚Ä¶ Hillary. It seems probable that she paid for the ‚Äúlets have a coup‚Äù op-ed that three retired generals floated.

Only cucks are stupid enough to donate to charities like the Salvation Army, hence suppression of the information and another reminder that churches, charties, and NGO‚Äôs are all corrupt and do not deserve one thin dime.

                True, but they had to apologize in a desperate attempt to salvage the very brutal drop in donations and volunteering. Disney can go woke, they have enough cash and properties that will make them money that they can run a century losing money and never care. The Salvation Army cannot go woke as they essentially just ended. Little donations (most done by White people who don‚Äôt like apologizing for their skin color) and even less volunteering. That was real penalties.

                I have to stay under length limits to avoid moderation. But, over and over again real important people are finding out that there are limits. The Head of the Salvation Army will have to find real work as his organization is likely to not even exist next year. Fauci and Biden had their lockdown plans pulled. Very important people are getting killed in their mansions by BLM freed felons. And the price of getting rid of Trump is that Warren is on the warpath of basically eliminating most important industries and destroying the wealth of important CEOs (tied up in stock distributions). Meaning more important people with power and influence are being affected. Nero like Caligula ticked off Rome‚Äôs Aristocracy too many times and got whacked for it. I see the same thing there ‚Äî with the ‚Äúsavior,‚Äù the ‚ÄúOne‚Äù being ‚Ä¶ Hillary to replace Biden. To replay 2016. That seems to be the plans of the important people anyway.

        ‚ÄúRight now, it is great fun for rich people who are not required to play along with the loons. The politicians have to participate in Covid theater, but in private they think it is just a big goof.‚ÄùI have seen the truth of this for myself. My work frequently brings me into Elite enclaves and they only care about the lockdowns when the cameras are running. Meanwhile, their servitors (frequently undocumented migrants) never take their masks off.Technically I‚Äôm a servitor, but I‚Äôm also a white man who acts like their peer, so they‚Äôve never demanded I wear the mask of servility. Or ritually wash hands or stay a respectful distance away or whatever the slave rule du jour is.I cannot wake up any of my friends &amp; family to the idea that the lockdowns are a sick joke, no pun intended. Perhaps they need to see what I see for themselves.

        These people are highly vulnerable.

            Whitney:  From what I‚Äôve read online, it appears the noggers are now routinely targeting CA areas like Brentwood and Beverly Hills.  I fully agree that most of these folks deserve what‚Äôs coming to them ‚Äì they need to own this.  The same with the White woman who has apparently received death threats after her Mestizo neighbors filmed her asking them to tone down their raucous Christmas Eve party.  Guarantee you she voted for and championed the cause of diversity and gimmigrants.The problem here is that these people are still not owning their actions, but rather fleeing the consequences.  If you believe their comments (and anyone who does is a fool), the majority of the CA residents fleeing to Idaho and North Carolina and Texas call themselves ‚Äòconservative.‚Äô  This means they might not believe in fully defunding the cops.  They still endlessly agitate for political measures in their new home states that will result in the same dystopian multicultural chaos they left behind in CA.They need to OWN this, and suffer its effects personally, rather than being able to move on and inflict the same insanity elsewhere. I enjoyed a moment of schadenfreude when I read recently that the anti-White South African mulatto purported tv comic sued his black doctor.  I want to see White pilots stop flying Jay Z and his fellow thugs to Italy.  I don‚Äôt want to see anymore White bodyguards for non-White actors and rappers.  Let auto mechanics and carpenters and even bug spray guys start using any excuse ‚Äì fear of the coof or fear of crime or a dodgy car or whatever ‚Äì but average White people need to stop enabling the elites.  It would be nice if there was even a smidgen of White solidarity, but it seems most are merely concerned with padding their own nest and will sell out the rest for the right price.

                First, totally agreed since what follows plays off a subpoint you made.‚ÄúThe problem here is that these people are still not owning their actions, but rather fleeing the consequences. If you believe their comments (and anyone who does is a fool), the majority of the CA residents fleeing to Idaho and North Carolina and Texas call themselves ‚Äòconservative.‚Äô This means they might not believe in fully defunding the cops. They still endlessly agitate for political measures in their new home states that will result in the same dystopian multicultural chaos they left behind in CA.‚ÄùEven putting aside the political dimension, if that is at all possible, these people in large numbers also destabilize local cultures. Most Southerners and (real) Westerners have distinctive lifestyles and don‚Äôt give a single shit about how they did it back in Portland or wherever. While your local leaders are greedy, make them tighten zoning and planning to the fullest extent possible before you find yourself in a strange culture surrounded by people who even look like you.

                    More small towns are instituting moratoriums on building permits, especially for multi-family units. The given reason is that all of the new building, traffic and general population is overwhelming the local infrastructures. Now, that is certainly true in a lot of cases, but even if not, it is a very good and believable excuse.

                        That‚Äôs the only way to do it. What‚Äôs the point moving to a new town when it just gets built into little Mexico/India in 20 years?
Seen it happen in Canada many times, a small white town / city open up new subdivision construction and suddenly it‚Äôs swamped with 80% non white subdivisions. No construction happens in the town it‚Äôs just on plots adjacent.
So yeah, all construction needs to be halted (or 90% reduced) or you will just get paved over by the ever increasing diverse population.

                    I decided not to return to CA after finishing my four years in the Air Force. While I like living in Florida, there are still some things about CA I miss. Still, I‚Äôm very thankful to not have to deal with the covid insanity being pushed by Gov. Gabbin Nuisance. I see serious demographic trouble brewing in the future though. This state is made up of people who came from somewhere else. Be it Cubans, Puerto Ricans, New Yorkers, Alabamans, etc, we have a big mismash of peoples who have little in common with each other, and want different things. DeSantis had to force a lot of liberal areas to back off of covid insanity. Especially down in Miami. If those areas grow in power they could tip the balance of power in Florida and turn this place into shit-lib central just like what happened in CA.

            See my other comment, the mother in law (herself wife to a billionaire black music producer) of Ted Sarandros of Netflix was killed by a homie in a home invasion in Beverly Hills. Her sole security guard was of no use. The Piv, Jeremy Piven was home invaded, a Real Housewife, others you likely heard of in the Hollywood Hills, Beverly Hills, and even Malibu. Outside Zuck few of these people have large amounts of  armed guards. Arnie the exception. Its extremely expensive save for the most uber-wealthy and there are few people really good at it.Zuck, Gates, a few others can be constantly on the move, in private jets with the most skilled and highly paid pilots. Most of the rest actually have to be in one place and work: the heads of Studios, famous actors, directors, CEOs of companies like Ford, GE, or P&amp;G. They can‚Äôt avoid crime by jetting around the world every few days so their persons and stuff can be targeted. REITs and other companies heavily invested in say, NYC office space are finding COVID lockdowns and crime makes their office towers very empty with payments due but no revenues. The highest tier is immune, but those below them are finding their interests diverging rapidly.

        Once heard that when Britain deported its unwanted to Australia, the ship‚Äôs captain knew that the biggest threat to a transported woman who was going wild on the long voyage was to threaten to cut her hair off. That was good enough to stop them getting out of hand. The trouble was, once you cut a trouble-making transported woman‚Äôs hair off there would be no stopping her craziness. No threat could carry any weight after that.In short, the last thing the captain wanted to do was cut a woman‚Äôs hair off.I feel our elite are beginning to think the same. The more they cut back on us and the more they impose on us, the more it is like cutting our hair off. There comes point when if they make good with their threats, then doing the act will make them wish they hadn‚Äôt done it.

            oh bs, they would have hung anyone making trouble.  or just thrown them overboard.   don‚Äôt have to do that very often to make your point stick.  again, you do not know your history.   the British (at that point in time) would hang a person for stealing bread:
‚ÄúDuring the 18th century, the number of crimes that were punished by hanging rose to about 200. Some, such as treason or murder, were serious crimes, but others were what we would call minor offences. For example, the death sentence could be passed for picking pockets or stealing food.‚Äù

        Z is right. The elites and those in charge are lazy, cruel, detached from reality, and spoiled. Their one weakness is atheism ‚Äì and fear of death.They don‚Äôt care about facts and logic. Pleas on humanitarian grounds (poor kids masking in school!) makes no difference to them. Peaceful protests are meaningless. But they do care about dying, as we see with the COVID response and also the push for youth culture, corpses like Pelosi and Biden and McCain staying in office well past their expiry date.When dealing with a bully, the only way to solve the problem is to punch back. Give the bully a bloody nose, or even better knock him out, and they know not to mess with you going forward.I hope people can read between the lines here; this is the only solution unfortunately.The COVID response severity in white countries seems to correspond directly to how afraid the government is of its people. Red states, well armed have almost no restrictions. Blue states are pretty bad, but they‚Äôre still restraining themselves a bit‚Ä¶ Then we have Canada and Europe which are in full on tyranny, they disarmed us all and we‚Äôre more peaceful. The French and others seem to have some zest fighting back though. And finally there‚Äôs Australia, totally disarmed (even worse than Canada) and is basically returned to being a giant prison camp.

            I agree with you,  the bully analogy nails it.Some ideas and those who champion them are deleterious to society. Tolerance of massive drug abuse ‚Äù the homeless‚Äù sexual deviants pursuing children ‚Äù love is ageless‚Äù   are   just   two obvious egregious examples.  These ideas are supported &amp; encouraged by the ruling class. They enjoy seeing ‚Äúdirt people‚Äù suffering.What is called liberalism today is libritineism.  Those responsible  are infected with moral cancer, surgery cannot be done with out blood.

        Just a personal anecdote from my Christmas weekend.  I live in rural Oklahoma and am not subject to any of the left wing lunacy I read about on this site.  Most rural whites in Oklahoma are poor, but are down to earth people who are very unpretentious.  What you see is what you get.My daughter and her husband (and my young grandsons) live in a upper middle class neighborhood in the Oklahoma City area.  Oklahoma City is probably one of the most conservative cities in the U.S.A. I went to visit my daughter over the Christmas weekend and was taken aback by the numerous lawn signs in the neighborhood pledging allegiance to all the left wing fads.My daughter and son-in-law are traditional conservatives and are really put off by all the moral postering by their neighbors. They are actually considering relocating to a more rural area to get away from the nonsense even though it would be a longer commute for my son-in-law. I am encouraging ithe move because I don‚Äôt want my gransons growing around bat shit crazy people.I know a lot of people on this site say it wrong to flee the cities and we (white people) should stand our ground.  I understand the reasoning, but my family is what is most important to me and I don‚Äôt want my grandsons corrupted by a toxic environment.Perhaps there is something to be said for Pol Pot‚Äôs strategy of gaining support in the rural areas first.

            The population is already sorting itself out. Hundreds of thousands have fled California, Illinois, and New York (the top three) for Southern states (Texas &amp; Florida are the top two). Richland County (Columbia), South Carolina has put a total moratorium on all new construction until they can upgrade infrastructure to accommodate the sudden increase in population. My daughter and son-in-law (in Richland County, SC) built their house 23 months ago, and it has already increased in value by $120,000. They will sell in the spring and move to the country. I went there for Halloween with my grandchildren, and my daughter was surprised to see that somebody had moved into a vacant house on her street the day before (a Saturday). We stopped to chat with them and learned that they were refugees from Maryland who had bought the house sight-unseen.So the population is already sorting itself out. The signs in your daughter‚Äôs OKC neighborhood are in the yards of people connected with ‚Äúan institution (ha!) of higher learning,‚Äù no doubt.DO get out of the cities. Do it now. The rest of the population is already doing it. Don‚Äôt wait.

                What‚Äôs your advice to a younger, single guy? I agree rural living is better in general but I‚Äôm concerned about the inability to find a spouse or have a social life in those areas.
My plan is to try and get transfered to a smaller whiter city ‚Äì better odds at finding a wife and has some stuff an urban area has but not as diverse or insane as a big city.

                    This is my issue as well. The city is insane but meeting a wife and having a good social life seems hard in the rural areas. Seems the suburbs would be the best middle ground to do.

                        I like to chime in whenever I see the comments drift to this topic. As a person who last fall escaped a corrupted city for the rural south, I would highly recommend you do not do the same, and instead find a suburban area with a reasonable commute, but in a different county, to decent sized city. I ran from Austin and relocated to a 2.75 acre spread on the F/G/L, and it kind of sucks despite my trying to make the best of it. The social opportunities are practically non-existent and it is a terrible place to find a decent woman unless you want to marry a tatted up chain smoker and be stepdad to her mulatto brood. Blacks outnumber whites by a large margin (don‚Äôt believe demographic data you find online), the men are mostly obese retards that guzzle beer, smoke, jack off to their guns, and make a litany of excuses for why they ‚Äúhad to get the vaccine.‚Äù Also, they worship Fox news, support Israel (although they don‚Äôt know why) and participate in the Scratch Off Retirement System. The roadsides are usually littered with trash for miles and you‚Äôll frequently hear folks say stupid shit like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not all black people.‚Äù

                    B125, that‚Äôs a good question and I don‚Äôt have a good answer.  I will say that most of the career girls in the cities probably won‚Äôt make great wives.  They have probably had sex with numerous men and are likely pretty damaged.
As Jonny said, maybe the suburbs is the way to go.  Perhaps at a youth group at a conservative church?

                        A lot of the ‚Äòconservative‚Äô churches are pozzed beyond belief.  I‚Äôm old and generally happily married, but if I was looking, I‚Äôd look somewhere that I was involved in an activity or work I already enjoyed or was interested in.  For example, I‚Äôve received a fair number of inquiries in the past 2-5 years at the gym as to my marriage and availability status.Local livestock store, horse competitions, get to know the moms who do canning or organize local events, etc.  Get involved in the fabric of the community.  Become friends with your neighbors and let their wives know you are looking.  Let your local tradesmen know you‚Äôre looking for a marriage and family minded woman.  That‚Äôs the way it used to be done, albeit in a more formalized manner.

                    I think you will find that in the rural areas, while there may not be as much ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù of choice for future wives or social scenes, the overall quality can often be quite better. Stay away from the career-minded women and find one that wants to have a family first.

                    go to one of the Scando countries, or Eastern European ones.  Your SMV will be much higher there, get a better quality chick.  take an extended visit there, or maybe get work.  forget Canada and the US, unless you want more of the same old shit.

            I‚Äôm one of those who advocates standing your ground, although my stance has proven unconvincing, so oh well. I also had the circumstance of growing up in a fairly uncorrupted place that has become a battleground in the last couple of decades, as waves of people have fled the cities and now the suburbs, led by developers and chased by libs and vibrants. I am now convinced that racket will only end when the money runs out, because it seems most people will only turn and fight when they can no longer afford to run. Fwiw.I‚Äôm about ready to give up on this civilization thing and become a simple tobacco farmer lol.

                Agreed! I think there are many folks in pozzed cities who believe they‚Äôre going to ride into the ‚ÄúRural South‚Äù and be greeted by a welcoming committee of dissidents ready to roll up their sleeves and get to work building a moral society! They will be disappointed. Bottom line: keep running and you‚Äôll run out of places to run to.

            I lived in eastern Oklahoma in the late 70sI was young and the fishing was fantastic.  Should have never left.Your last line.. you may be on to something. Winners write history,  maybe old pol pot could see something that was left out of the narrative.

            I am a lifelong Oklahoman.  And I can tell you that Oklahoma City is gone, gone, gone.  I had an occasion to be downtown about six months ago and the storefronts, etc. scream woke.  Audio from some invislble source exhorts you at every crosswalk.  The whirling in their graves of the cattlemen and oilmen who built that place will cause a black hole.The only question that remains is how long they will allow the stockyards to keep functioning.  I guess as long as the businesses that are across the street keep bringing in sales tax, the powers-that-be will look the other way.  But not forever . . .   Old white men   with land and cattle double plus ungood, you know.

        The COVID fear campaign is nearing the end. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.Two Headlines:‚ÄúCritics slam ‚Äòhypocrite‚Äô Biden for claiming ‚Äòno federal solution‚Äô to pandemic after vow to ‚Äòshut down‚Äô ‚ÄúAND‚ÄúBiden says states bear responsibility for COVID resolution.‚ÄùI take this to mean the fear campaign is unworkable, becoming unproductive, and the marginal profits are thinning. Furthermore, in advance, Klain and company know how the Supremes would love to force it on us, but it just may be a bridge too far result in the chaos and elite fear, the Zman blogs about here. It‚Äôs a no-go.Time to move on to stirring up trouble in Europe by threatening a public good between Russia and Germany. The US needs to f with the Nord Stream 2 agreement; this project is a new development that suddenly the US needs to mediate terms.Further, South East the US will aggravate the Russians by meddling their border security by making Ukraine a threat. In the background is the existential threat and echoing of the constant narrative of Climate Disaster by the young-uns, edubacated in the late ‚Äô80s onward. Threats everywhere, but forcing folks to take magical gubamint Covid elixers does not seem to be flying.

            In my Deep South state, most of us have ignored the whole thing. Many churches ignored the whole thing, including mine. Our governors have not made headlines like de Santis in Florida has, but that‚Äôs because they have largely ignored the whole thing. you all may remember last year when Georgia, after shutting down for two weeks ‚Äúto flatten the curve,‚Äù re-opened to the howls of the talking heads, but nothing happened. Everybody went back to normal, and that was that.What almost nobody seems to have grasped is that the whole stupid charade has depended 100% on the cooperation of the population because we don‚Äôt have a national police force, so it was at all times going to be left to the local county sheriffs to enforce‚Äìor not‚Äìthe diktats of the bureaucrats in DC. Which meant that your local High Sheriff was in the position of having to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to destroy your lives, but I hope you‚Äôll re-elect me in November,‚Äù which was at all times a non-starter. When a friend of mine in Atlanta was wigging out about Joe Biden‚Äôs threats to interdict interstate travel, I explained the ‚Äúlocal sheriff factor,‚Äù and she calmed down. That sort of thing was never going to happen anywhere at any time. Even the High Sheriff of Los Angeles County, California, publically said that he would not enforce any of the coof nonsense, and he didn‚Äôt.The whole stupid episode is on its last legs‚ÄìUNLESS Klauss Schwab and the WEF crowd somehow contrive to shut down the power grid through a ‚Äúcyber-attack‚Äù (to be perpetrated by those wicked Russians, of course), or to collapse the international payments system, or to interrupt the supply chain, or something along those lines.Then, all bets would be off.

                The LA County sheriffs‚Äô refusal has been the only pleasant surprise of the coof era so far. By the standards of liberty and justice and other American type stuff, they‚Äôre the worst non-fed police force in the country, yet they stood up for the people‚Äîa little, and incidentally to other considerations, but still. No one familiar with them would bet against them leaping at a new opportunity to crack prole skulls.

                Infant:  I wouldn‚Äôt put any of your ‚Äòunless‚Äô possibilities as out of bounds.  The WEF crowd is deadly serious about wanting us all miscegenated, chipped, bug-eating automatons.  And while I‚Äôm not blaming any one individual or group, I found a post at Western Rifle Shooters (and I take all their stuff with a hefty dose of salt) very poignant and accurate: Everything that has been predicted about the Covid hysteria and dismissed as a loony conspiracy theory has happened.  And every step of the way people have complied and retreated and set a new theoretical ‚Äòline‚Äô that will always be crossed and redrawn.Look at the list of the North American representatives to the WEF‚Äôs latest ‚Äòdo ‚Äì it‚Äôs all black and Han and South Asians and Juice and womyn.  And meanwhile, the cops in Europe and Australia seem to be enjoying terrorizing the local inhabitants.  Their neighbors are apparently fine ‚Äì haven‚Äôt read any accounts of cops‚Äô children called any mean names, let alone wives not welcomed at any neighborhood parties.As long as the elite‚Äôs enforcers can continue to operate with impunity, nothing will change.

            The critics slamming Biden after his comments are mostly conservacucks who, as usual, are messing up. When Biden says, ‚Äúthere is no federal solution‚Äù, the correct response is, ‚Äúthere is no solution, virus gonna virus.‚Äù The correct response is NOT ‚Äúomg look another broken Biden promise, vote GOP in 2022!‚Äù This just gives the left an opportunity to blame the GOP for Biden not being able to fix it, which they are already doing. Œôt is amazing how consistently horrible the GOP is at this sort of thing, almost like it is by design.Any politician or official who is not doing everything in their power to end this charade and ensure no more mandates, no more tests, no more masks, no more lockdowns, is as far as I am concerned an enemy of the people.

                Mycale:  Why do you eve give a f&amp;&amp;k about the GOP?  There is NO political solution to ANY of this.  Forget about party A and party B, or standard terminology of left and right.  This is based on race, with class and money following closely behind.  Stop looking to any politician or ‚Äòofficial‚Äô or ‚Äòexpert‚Äô to save you or fix anything ‚Äì it‚Äôs not going to happen.

        Are you reading Bill James‚Äô book Popular Crime Reflections? Because I am right now and that book has the two bomb attacks you mention in it. And although I had vaguely heard about the Wall Street bomb I had never, until maybe yesterday when I read about it, heard about the LA Times bomb. Freakish that two almost forgotten events I read about yesterday show up here. Anyway, maybe just a strange coincedence.I think you are absolutely on the money about democracy. I even think that the ‚Äòpeace-keeping effect‚Äô of nuclear weapons is not because they are absolutely horrendous to ordinary people but exactly because they are SO terrible that there would be extremely uncomfortable, immediate, personal, in-your-face consequences to the shot-callers if those things went off in substantial numbers.Superficial charm, ruthlessness, courage, expanded ambition, narcissism, manipulativeness, cynicism, lack of conscience. To a professional campaign manager those traits would constitute the perfect candidate. It is not a canard that liberal democracy selects for sociopaths, it is game theory. So this is an important criticism of modern democracy and a possible explanation for why it often leads to authoritarianism.

            ‚ÄúThey take pleasure in mocking the crazies and their ornamental face gear. They think it is hilarious that the masses just go along with the ridiculous measures that serve no purpose beyond humiliation.‚Äù
This is probably literally true (private pictures from Boris Johnson‚Äôs Downing Street prove it is true in the UK) and strongly suggests elements of sadism. The sociopath problem of democracy is not a boogey man.

                    I haven‚Äôt read this, yet but the usual solution if one is given is an interregnum of Right Wing authoritarianism, a dictatorship  of 20 to 40 years depending on how long restoration takes.
After that a limit franchise something like White, Male Christian Landowners and a much stricter system of public morality.
The actual stuff you have to do the policy is rather  basic to be honest   but it requires a kind of Right that   that isn‚Äôt controlled by the money boys and exiles immediately anyone who thinks ‚ÄúConservatism is an attitude‚Äù rather than set eugenic and pro civic polices

            Moran:  ‚Äù (He) almost never says what he means. Because that would pin him down. This politician who feigns to be its antithesis is the consummate politician. He carefully says what he thinks you‚Äôll assume he means.What he wants you to believe.His language is bombastically vague, full of freedom-loving hints that enrapture those who badly want to believe it. So much so that they allow themselves to believe it.Much is left unsaid and it is the unsaid which tells you the most.If you‚Äôll listen to it.He leaves it up to his audience to think they heard what he didn‚Äôt say ‚Äì a brilliant tactic employed by the greatest artists, the most effective demagogues. These things tell the crowd what it wants to hear ‚Äì but in such a way that no one in the crowd can say precisely what it was that they thought they heard.This is how (pick a politician) became a kind of savior figure to many who were desperate for an alternative to the things which seemed unassailable, periodically handing off to each other the offices and titles used to oppress and fleece us.‚Äù

        Bellevue: Three Centuries of Medicine and Mayhem at America‚Äôs Most Storied Hospital by David Oshinsky. Being from NYC, I really enjoyed this book. It‚Äôs a good lite read for the down time of the holidays. It‚Äôs amazing how the medical field went from Anglo/ European, to juice, to Asian. I have 3 MD‚Äôs in my family, none of them could boil an egg. Truly 3 of the dumbest people I know. I‚Äôve been realizing lately that the curiosity Gene seems to be slowly breading out of civilization in general. Unless of course you consider ( hey Alexa, how many cups in a quart?) as being curious.

        The last US president I recall having an ‚Äúevent‚Äù was Ronald Reagan.
There was that one guy who tossed his shoes at GW Bush , but that was actually pretty funny and proved GW still had good reflexes. Had that happened today, I‚Äôm pretty sure FJB would have taken both to the face!
Question is, after the ‚Äúevent‚Äù with Ronald Reagan, were there any significant policy changes that affected the general public? Did the ruling class clamp down on the plebs by introducing any new legislation that impacted their constitutional rights?

            Speaking of Reagan, he famously said:‚ÄúThe closest thing we‚Äôve come to discovering eternal life is a government program.‚ÄùEnormous amounts of power, prestige, and wealth were created when the Covidians in state/local/federal government expanded their regulatory hooks and dictates to address Covid; great wealth continues to be amassed by Big Pharma coming up with ever more frequent (and expensive) preventatives and treatments.The Zman is right.  Barring some personal risk or loss to our ruling political and corporate classes, Covid will never, ever go away.  It has been managed to be a boon to their interests.Even if something were to happen (financial pain, for example), there‚Äôs a good chance the new powers and wealth created by the Covid response will just shift to something else.  The multi-decade homosexual lobby didn‚Äôt retire when gay marriage was declared a totally unrestricted right: they, and their whole apparatus immediately found new work giving us the transgender movement which seems to have so stopping point to it‚Äôs ridiculousness.

                    Maybe that is what they had in mind regarding the new normal.
To reset a society it would be logical to break every institution‚Äôs function.

                        The ‚Äúeducation‚Äù sector of the economy is the largest and most profitable ‚Äúindustry‚Äù in AINO. (Including all its ancillary ‚Äúindustries.)
That is also the foundation of their powre‚Äìindoctrination of defenseless children. So although I concede that anything is possible where these psychos are concerned, I don‚Äôt agree that what is happening‚Äìthe currently clear trajectory of events‚Äìis what ‚Äúthey‚Äù had in mind. They expected things to go much ore quickly. The roll-out of the whole charade was remarkably clumsy. They have overplayed their hand is all.

                    The loss of respect, admiration, pride, and commitment to our institutions is becoming more and more evident. This leads to distrust, lawlessness, and anarchy. The bonds that once held us together are dissolving. Honor, bravery, your reputation, ha! we used to fight duels to save our honor. Things are falling apart because we no longer have a common interest. The virtuous man is a sucker. John Wayne and Clint Eastwood are the last of the dinosaurs. Good times, weak men. No use for a Dirty Harry anymore. Ask not, what i can do for my country, but what can my country do for me.

                        This is just an observation.
But it is interesting how your 2 examples are actors playing characters in a fiction, rather than a real person in public life coming to mind.
I wonder  what is the last point in the recent past the same comment would have referenced a real person in business or politics?

                        Not in my lifetime Trumpton. The last heroic deed I saw was the Kenosha Kid and with much respect to Kyle, that was self defense not heroism
Truth is world dominance means no more heroes since there are no real challenges.
Its why even under the wisest loved by everyone most benevolent leader, heck one who was actually immortal, a world government would end up a self destructing hellscape.
Humans can‚Äôt adapt to large scale  prosperity  any more than Calhoun‚Äôs mice could  . We can‚Äôt breed, we don‚Äôt strive. We must suffer, achieve a null state (like Buddhism) or die.

        ‚ÄúOne consequence of the bombing was the federal government got serious about the communists and anarchists in the country. They rounded them up and deported them even though they could not pin the crime on them.‚Äùcouple of questions:‚Äì are the elites willing to abandon their greater goal of demoralizing the white race when they could easily move to a different country?‚Äì is america‚Äôs elite still WASP cause if they are descended from foreigners they might rejoice whenever they see bombings &amp; immigrants tormenting white neighbourhoods.‚Äì how long till elites decide to stop immigration before it‚Äôs to late?‚Äì let‚Äôs say immigration stops tommorow, are the elites willing to send them all back?‚Äì have all those anti-commie policies from the past even amount to anything? Things have only gotten much worse since then.Pretty sure we were born too late in history, meaning the elite is too corrupt &amp; too up their own asses to do fix anything. They‚Äôd rather vaccinate us all(4 times a year, maybe more if possible) &amp; tag us then help our people in any way, this does not mean we are all doomed, this is an opportunity for whites to return to their rootes, to become tribal again &amp; realize that racism is not a sin(especially if you‚Äôre an atheist cause that would make you really fucking dumb).

                The WASPS are all but gone. They mainly didn‚Äôt breed and the few that remain are Leftists  are like Gavin Newsome who to  his credit actually has 4 kids or Country Club filth.Frankly its good riddance to bad rubbish anyway. They‚Äôve become too corrupt and lost the proverbial mandate of heaven long ago.We need a new ruling class but to get it means embracing the desire for power and some goals.I am not sure that this  is possible, far too many of  our people have this Thoreau like ‚Äúleave me alone‚Äù ideal and little desire for the responsibility of rebuilding.That nilhism effects all of us,  a sense of ennui of ‚Äúwhy   bother.‚Äù since you‚Äôll just get rich again and fall again.I don‚Äôt know how to overcome that , maybe some future White Right or White Nationalist Warlord will or some fanatic with a religious or political goal.

            The man running for president in 2024 who finally addresses how we could get all of Joe Biden‚Äôs illegal immigrant pals back out of this country will be merely very interesting to me, since as long as we have Dominion voting machines and mail-in ballots, globohomo will remain firmly in charge (I pray I‚Äôm wrong, and if I am, I will be shocked beyond measure.).
So far, all we are getting is gnashing of teeth about how terrible this latest version of The Invasion is.   Not a peep about how to run them off.

‚ÄòCuz they don‚Äôt want to.  ‚ÄòCept for a handful.
‚ÄòMIC?  They‚Äôre a lot of ‚Äòcomplexes‚Äô.
This one‚Äôs called ‚ÄòThe Slave/Pedo/Drug Govt. Industrial Complex‚Äô.
If El Chapo can grease the palm of the President of Mexico with $100 million‚Ä¶is it stretch not to believe the cartels/chicoms/corporations can do the same with the ‚Äòuniparty‚Äô?
It‚Äôs a simple switch to flip to run them off:
No benefits.  Period.
No SNAP, free ER, public school, HUD, section 8, (Non) Earned Income Credit, etc.
But they won‚Äôt flip it.

                    I‚Äôm waiting for one of the ‚Äúhandful‚Äù among the MAGA troops to prove his bona fides regarding immigration.  Not holding my breath, though.  The idea of exporting the invaders probably conjures the vision of a tongue-lashing from the mainstream media as well as the local librarians, as they design the graphics for ‚ÄúDiversity Month‚Äù on taxpayer-bought computers.Brings to mind the time I took my homeschooled children to the downtown library in the naughts and encountered a Berlin Wall of photographic exhibits celebrating ‚ÄúGay Pride.‚Äù  (How can you be proud about whom you screw?  I still haven‚Äôt figgered that one out.  Turns out to have been a fairly tame warm-up for Drag Queen Story Hour.)I ended our library excursions with nary a look back, although I was somewhat saddened, given that the traditional Carnegie library in my small Oklahoma hometown was a source of joy and learning as I grew up.

                        I loved my downtown library as a kid and young adult.  Beautiful architecture, huge historical/mythical murals on the walls of the main floor, with gorgeous wood staircases.  I remember  a sculpture of Romulus and Remus suckling the twins.  I‚Äôm an old lady now, but about during the Patriot act stuff years ago, I visited and saw zero white librarians.  The building was full of diversity thugs and homeless, but a bored looking older black woman ‚Äúsecurity officer‚Äù chose to search my purse.  I‚Äôd been visiting that library my whole life, but I never went back.

                        Where I grew up was a smallish town in the north of England that was running to poverty.
The library however, was a fantastic Victorian building with a central interior dome like the british museum with wood paneled walls and huge shelves paid for oddly enough by Andrew Carnegie that was a joy to be in for many hours.
He paid for 2,509 public libraries around the world in big and small populations centers over 40 years.
I wonder how many of our modern robber barons have done even 1% of this?

                My guess is that what is going on generally is not visible. John Adams, in a letter to a friend years after independence, said that the war‚Äìthe shooting and killing‚Äìwas not the revolution; that the revolution had already taken place‚Äìin the people‚Äôs hearts and minds‚Äìbefore the first shot of the war was ever fired. I think that‚Äôs where we are now. It‚Äôs just not generally visible. It won‚Äôt be on TV, this sea change in the people‚Äôs heats and minds. But it‚Äôs happening everywhere now. The revolution is well advanced already.

                WhereAreTheVikings:  You gave away the game by being upset specifically by ‚Äòillegal immigrants.‚Äô  Any serious dissident rightist knows that magic papers aren‚Äôt real, and a beet planted in a potato field still grows up to be  . . . a beet.  And for those who try to claim the ‚Äòillegals‚Äô represent a good start ‚Äì I disagree.  I‚Äôd start with the brown, black, and yellow ‚Äòlegals‚Äô who started coming and setting down roots and squatting out kids back in 1965.  Start with the older and most established first.  The newcomers will be far easier to dissuade.

                    Depends.  I‚Äôm not sure which Jenga piece results in the rest tumbling away of their own accord. Does deporting the integrated respectible ones really impact the favelas? Probably not, they have to see their own neighboorhood community impacted, not just someone from the nice part of town they never see or hear from; many such are considered Oreos or the equivalent anyway. Will require extensive legal changes first, though.

                Simply because it involved either forcible removal of the people in charge and/or  open ethnic warfare.
Its not that our society is too comfortable mind but getting Conservative people to vote for outright civil war is very hard  short of utter desperation like the South and impossible without  an ideology.

                i agree, whichever groups will make it out alive &amp; sane after a decade(more or less) of this woke insanity will probably choose to isolate themselves from the rest of the world.
All this woke guidelines have become too intricate &amp; too insane, they have censored the human spirit like it has never been before, the system also requires a technologically advanced sociey while trying to limit the reproduction of native population &amp; bringing in massive waves of savages. In what type of universe can this insanity work? It will break apart eventually.

                    Yes, well, in my opinion, AINO has already broken apart. The population is now in the process of sorting itself out. There are stories now even in the popular press about the hundreds of thousands of people moving from crazy places to less-crazy places. But you are right: There will be several new countries in North America within the next fifteen years.

                    My original guess  back in the oughties was  the US would fall apart or go to civil war by 2035.Corona Chan may have sped this up or initiated it, I don‚Äôt know .That said none of us know exactly what to replace it with which is why Clown World persists by inertia.That old saw ‚ÄúLead, follow, or get out of the way.‚Äù fails when everyone steps aside and no one steps up.I can‚Äôt blame them, I don‚Äôt think life can get  much better than say an upper middle class lifestyle in the US circa 2000.This rules out material gains for potential leaders and our people aren‚Äôt wired to enjoy power . The usual alternative is religion but a lot of us are very far from religious.This kind of leaves revenge, good old  political cleansing , less ethnic cleansing as  Americans are a bit deracinated though some of that too.Its a scary proposition since its disorder incarnate but embraced, that Jungian Wotan might be enough.Still won‚Äôt end up with rebuilding and until someone wants to do that we just have to let it ride .

                    I think we can expect the final crisis after two more presidential election cycles: 2032. People‚Äìmost people‚Äìstill haven‚Äôt figured it out. IT‚Äôs going to take two more cycles before most Americans are good and ready to give up the idea that their vote means anything. So 2032.

        I‚Äôve long heard only heart disease and cancer kill more Americans than healthcare, and I‚Äôm inclined to believe it because of how sick and drugged up Americans are. Oil, banking, real estate, automotive, big tech‚Äî how often do the great industries end up making the market for their goods and services?
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if lately healthcare is making a run at the reaper.

        I‚Äôm beginning to wonder if the polio epidemic of the early 20th century was entirely a media phantasm all along.  Polio was a real virus that did rarely cause paralysis.  But it only became a ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù with widespread reporting by mass media.   And was a perfect candidate for panic porn because it struck randomly, rich and poor alike (actually it seams to have hit the wealthy more than the poor).  Perhaps even, the medical interventions made the disease effects worse in specific individuals.All of that is a real heresy in our science worshipping age.But may well be the truth.

                My cousin had polio.  It was real.  She was paralyzed waste down for months, but slowly recovered leg use‚Äîalthough her leg growth (length) was stunted as an adult.  Doubly tragic as this occurred in the last great wave before first vaccine.
But regardless, this comment is just an anecdote.  I don‚Äôt know all the stat‚Äôs as to how many were affected or the recovery rate.  I suspect there perhaps are many similarities to the current Covid scamdemic.

            Tough call on polio. I also don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs had it, but I also don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs not been vaccinated against it.
I think vaccines are real science. The problem is that, like anything else, once people are on the hook you can push inferior or even dangerous product.

                Like most things it is a cost vs reward decision.  A vaccine that 1% of people get a bad reaction from may be worth it to protect the other 99% from a *paralytic* disease. Likewise if the mortality rate of Covid was 5-10% rather than 0.05%, then extreme measures may have been warranted.  Airbags are another interesting example. Initially it was estimated that each life saved cost 1 million+.  Not to mention all the kids whose necks were broken.  May sound callous but it wasn‚Äôt worth it.  Come to think of it, what is the general $$ cost acceptable of a human life saved due to a safety feature; from a public policy standpoint. I know that Vit A, and folic acid supplements are a good deal because their cost is negligible.  Any actuaries read this blog?

                    Just goes to bolster a point I saw made not too long ago, that nothing is in response to the market anymore.  Automobiles are the biggest example.  Was there a big demand for air bags?  No.  Was there clamoring for vehicles to shut down at stop lights only to restart?  No.  Was there mass insistence for that obnoxious beep torturing me into putting my seat belt on?  Huh-uh.  And tell me this:were American women demanding that irons no longer get hot enough to work?  Not on your life.The personal injury lawyers can take a lot of credit for this particular brand of misery.  Otherwise, power-mad little dictators in government cubicles can step up and take a bow.  Edward Dutton talks about feminized culture‚Äôs hallmarks being equality and, relative to this phenomenon, harm avoidance.  Boy, does he get that right.  America is on an estrogen drip.

                    SidVic:  First mechanic I find when enough of the official apparatus of the State falls apart, I‚Äôm gonna offer plenty of beans, bullets, and bandaids to kill all the safety beepers and dash warnings in whatever vehicle I‚Äôm driving.  And I am reliably informed by my idiot daughter-in-law that the ‚Äòexperts‚Äô have now determined that children must ride in rear facing car seats until they‚Äôre two years old.  Same as they must always sleep flat on their back on a hard mattress.  And crib bumper pads will smother them, and taking them in the shower will cause them to aspirate water and die. Don‚Äôt forget, Safety First!

            My mother and a guy I worked with back in the early nineties both had polio as children in the ‚Äô40s. My mom had no visible aftereffects and the coworker had a bad leg and walked with a limp. However, both started to experience severe post-polio syndrome in their later years. Basically the alternate nerve pathways developed in response to the polio start to wear out, causing muscle weakness. My mom was eventually unable to walk without a walker and was in constant discomfort ‚Äî the syndrome can cause chronic pain and sensitivity to cold.It‚Äôs a poorly understood syndrome because almost nobody gets polio anymore, so there‚Äôs little urgency to understand a syndrome that may only start appearing a half century later.I don‚Äôt know how much of a pandemic it was, but it was a terrible disease to get, and I‚Äôm sure glad you almost never see it anymore.

            I know several older people, two who are cousins, crippled by polio. It was quite real, and to this day occurs in rare cases. Interestingly, the (effective) use of iron lungs to treat the disease was sometimes discouraged because it was thought to distract from the primary goal of the vaccine. Sound familiar?

                Germany has a long history of being anti-vaccination.https://www.dw.com/en/in-germany-vaccinations-have-always-been-political/a-56221965The imperial vaccination law came into force in 1874 as a result of widespread smallpox infections across Europe, which killed tens of thousands of people in Prussia. Getting vaccinated for it became mandatory. The ‚ÄúLebensreform‚Äù (life reform) movement picked up pace at the same time. Adherents believed in natural paths to strengthening the body, such as sunshine or special diets.The first vaccine opposition groups were founded in 1869 in Leipzig and Stuttgart ‚Äî five years before the imperial vaccination law. The Imperial Association Opposing Compulsory Vaccination soon had 300,000 members.For them, vaccines were the ‚Äúdevil‚Äôs tool,‚Äù Thiessen says. ‚ÄúSomething artificial, chemical getting injected into the body. That helps explain the huge opposition to vaccines in Germany‚Äôs alternative circles, until today.‚Äù

The polio epidemic is likely DDT poisoning, with tonnage of DDT manufacture an exact mirror of the polio epidemic. The polio epidemic lead with iron lung fear porn, exactly as Covid-19 fear porn led the current virus/vaccine hoax.
Furthermore, 95 million Americans were injected or fed Simian Virus 40, which oncogenic monkey virus contaminated the polio vaccine from it‚Äôs being cultured in Green Monkey Kidney tissue.
IMO‚Äìvaccine theory and practice is entirely a medical and scientific fraud. Read Robert Kennedy‚Äôs book on Fauci and the 35 year AIDS hoax.

                Its a not all type problem.
Smallpox definitely was arrested via cowpox vaxes, as it came from bottom up observation of resistance.
Polio has strong evidence as you point out related to pesticides.
It would be difficult to perhaps split the scams from the real at this point.

                Have you looked closely at photographs of the iron lung porn used by the March of Dimes and Jewish medical experts to magnify a pesticide(DDT) poisoning into an invisible viral epidemic?The objective was political power from the beginning.

        A good example of the point made in this post is the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement in France in 2018.  The movement forced a temporary rollback in fuel taxes because there was genuine fear among the French elites that they might be looking at a 1789 situation; French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly had the presidential helicopter ready to airlift him out of the Elysee Palace if the gilets jaunes stormed it.  Sadly, the movement fell apart but it did frighten the elites temporarily.  The demonstrations against the ‚Äúhealth passport,‚Äù have never reached that level of intensity and I think it will take serious economic hardship to bring France the equivalent of ‚Äúbread riots;‚Äù

That‚Äôs because they‚Äôre not actually our rulers in the old sense of the word, they‚Äôre prison trusties: rule-enforcers and hall monitors rather than rulers.

        I‚Äôd say that we‚Äôve reached the end of the line on a number of quantifiable things, i.e. this is more than just a ‚Äúfeel.‚ÄùThe United States and Western Europe have come to an end of a 40-year run where literally everything was in their favor economically, financially and demographically.In the early 1980s, the West had ‚Äì purely by accident ‚Äì set themselves up perfectly. It had four things that made it damn near impossible to fail:1. High interest rates2. Amazingly cheap stock market3. Reasonably low debt4. The Baby Boom ‚Äì the biggest, most educated group of workers ever ‚Äì coming onlineFalling interest rates for the next 40 years meant that debt became ever cheaper, which allowed everyone to load up on debt and made a bunch of money for bond holders. Cheap stocks made the stock market a money-making machine, pushing up stock value, helping investors and allowing companies to take on more debt. The Baby Boom provided the greatest workforce ever.With the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s, the West eliminated its only an external threat. And as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, China along with Eastern Europe, Russia and India came online in the 1990s, providing an almost unimaginable supply of cheap, capable workers to keep down inflation.You really couldn‚Äôt ask for more.But even by the early 2000s, cracks in that system were showing. Interest rates had fallen enough to push institutional investors to search for yield, leading to the housing bubble and bust. Really all forms of worldwide debt were getting past the point of servicing if anything went wrong.The whole system should have reset in 2008-2009 with the banks being restructured, the stock market getting obliterated, massive amounts of debt being written off and cost of money (interest rates) going higher since few people had money. In essence, clean out the system.Instead, the Fed papered everything over and dropped interest rates. In 2008, global debt to GDP was ~280%; it‚Äôs now approaching 400%. That level of debt is simply unserviceable at anything close to normal interest rates. Therefore, central banks have to keep rates low, but low rates cause malinvestment and give the central banks no room to fight inflation (by raising rates) or reacting to economic downturns (lowering rates).To stimulate the economy (and to keep debt growing something that credit-based systems require), countries are left with fiscal stimulus since monetary stimulus isn‚Äôt as effective. But fiscal stimulus is inflationary ‚Äì as is the fact that Chinese is no longer that cheap. Inflation is a nightmare for economies.Governments, businesses and investors around the world have reached the end of the line.Interest rates rates are about as low as they can go, meaning central banks can‚Äôt lower them during economic downturns and investors don‚Äôt earn anything. The stocks market is very expensive and thus more prone to downturns which lead to economic downturns. Government can only react to economic downturns with fiscal stimulus, which is inflationary and thus damaging to the economy.Finally, the Boomers are leaving the economy and will not be replaced with nearly as competent workers. Businesses can no longer cheaply send their production to China for a number of reasons.It‚Äôs the end of the line, folks. Get ready.

            ‚ÄúFalling interest rates for the next 40 years meant that debt became ever cheaper, ‚Ä¶ .‚ÄùThis is the crux of the matter. The low‚Äìand in some places even negative‚Äìinterest rate environment for the past 12 or 13 years has destroyed all the pension funds in the world. Socialism is dead, and that is the purpose of the Great Reset and its handmaiden, Covid.Debts are unpayable and pension funds and governments and entire countries are bankrupt. So all debts are to be cancelled and everyone is to be put on a universal basic income disbursed in the form of a one-world digital ‚Äúcurrency.‚Äù But it‚Äôs not a currency at all, any more than these so-called ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are real vaccines. It‚Äôs only a credit at the company store, and you can‚Äìand will‚Äìbe cut off if you get a low social credit score, etc.It‚Äôs all one thing. All one ball of wax.But you are right: We have come to the end of the world as we have known it.

                Pension funds will never be able to meet their obligations. On average, they need between a 6% and 7% long-term return to have enough money. (Actually, not even that is true. Most are still under-funded even with that return expectation.)If you keep 40% of your money in bonds earning ~2.5% (investment grade), you need to earn ~9% annual on the remaining 60% to get to 6.5%.The S&amp;P 500‚Äôs CAPE (10-year P/E) is 40! (It was ~43 at the peak of the Dot-Com bubble). The trailing 12-month P/E is 30. (The last time it hit that level outside of a recession which distorts trailing P/E was again the Dot-Com bubble.)There is zero change the S&amp;P will earn 9% annual over the next decade. And forget private equity, which used to invest in very small, very cheap companies, but now invests in mid-sized, expensive companies.The pension funds are toast. Everyone ‚Äì and, I mean, everyone ‚Äì knows this. They will fail and the government will step in and bail them out.There‚Äôs a Fed/Government ‚Äúput‚Äù (implicit backing) on literally everything in the economy ‚Äì stocks, bonds, real estate, pensions, etc. But what does the Fed/Govt have to throw at the problem?Lowering interest rates? No.It only has money creation/borrowing left. That‚Äôs it. Well, the govt has ~125% debt to GDP. In the next crisis, the govt will throw money at the problem and crank up debt. Maybe that works, maybe it doesn‚Äôt, but it will dramatically increase the money supply and that‚Äôs inflationary.The govt is playing with fire. There‚Äôs nothing left are the Fed/Govt. They‚Äôre the reserves. If you throw your reserves into the battle and they lose, you‚Äôve got a serious problem.

                        This is a DR blog so no one should take investing advice from it, but I‚Äôd recommend getting at least part of your money out of dollars and maybe even going short the dollar.What does that mean?It means don‚Äôt own bonds, especially treasury bonds, which are effectively dollars.It means consider taking a 30-fixed mortgage on the house at these incredibly low rates and using the money to buy hard assets. I prefer farmland. Directly owned apartments complexes and trailer parks are pretty good as well.I‚Äôd also suggest using an ensemble trend following approach for your stock allocation. (AllocateSmartly‚Äôs Meta strategy is fine.) You want the ability to get out of stocks if they crash, but stocks can also protect against inflation. You own tangible assets.Also, as much a Z seems to hate it, I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs crazy to keep between 1% and 5% of a portfolio in Bitcoin ‚Äì but that‚Äôs very optional. Bitcoin is a ‚Äúput‚Äù on the Fed ‚Äúput.‚ÄùYeah, yeah, I know. Never have debt. Very good advice unless the currency is being debased. Debasing a currency is great for holders of debt and terrible for anyone holding the currency via bonds. It‚Äôs a different world folks.Get out of dollars. Own income-producing assets, not bonds.Of course, none of that matters if the government just takes your stuff. In that case, you need an escape plan.

            That 5 decades of  low fertility is catching up with us and while Millennial/Gen Y youngsters are numerous for now, they lack skills and aren‚Äôt fertile.44% of young people want zero children which means unless the Gen Z is super fertile population shrinkage is inevitable.This is why the rush for Latino immigrants , that and spite .South Asians have numbers but are smart and more nepotistic than anyone also the ruling elite doesn‚Äôt want to be replaced and Africans can‚Äôt be controlled.A lot of  Africans are very Christian  .

        This perhaps was the best Zman essay of the year, as it explains perfectly the present dynamic in society.The problem is that the new oligarchs don‚Äôt share the same physical space as the peasants, unlike the oligarchs of yore. While the proles were stuck in airports over Christmas as flights were delayed/cancelled, the oligarchs flew privately (like Jeff Bezos, seen canoodling with that absurd bimbo in St. Barth‚Äôs), somehow evaded Covid quarantines the rest of us have to follow, and drove their yachts around the Caribbean.The lord of the manor of yore had to at least open the castle on Christmas and roll out a barrel of beer for his serfs. Today, the lords do business over Zoom, fly on their own planes and never even have to share the same air as their serfs. This can continue indefinitely! Nothing short of a general strike will catch their attention. Normally a stock market collapse would suffice, but the Fed will just buy stocks and prop it up.As Zman has pointed out, our overlords speak a different language, have a different worldview and don‚Äôt even share physical space with us. The mob is indeed likely to have the last word though‚Ä¶..

            ‚ÄúToday, the lords do business over Zoom, fly on their own planes and never even have to share the same air as their serfs. This can continue indefinitely!‚ÄùGermany has already shut down most of its nuclear power plants. Joe Biden wasted no time in cancelling the oil pipeline. We already have blackouts and rolling blackouts on both coasts. Even Texas, which has its own power grid, was plunged into chaos by a winter storm. The new German Foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, I *think* her name is‚Äìis now refusing to approve operation of the ready-to-go Nordstream II pipeline from Russia because of ‚ÄúRussian aggression.‚Äù And she‚Äôs also a Green Party member of the new coalition gov‚Äôt in Germany.And so on.So, I can‚Äôt agree that things can go on indefinitely. I wonder sometimes how our betters intend to erect and maintain a total-surveillance state worldwide without an UNFAILING supply of electricity, but that‚Äôs the plan. Of course, trillions are missing‚Äìalong with Nicolai Tesla‚Äôs notebooks on free and unlimited electricity, but given that our betters can‚Äôt even keep their own creepy love affairs secret, I doubt that they have some super-duper power source ready to go that they have managed to build and that they are ready to put into use at a moment‚Äôs notice. They just aren‚Äôt that smart. They are treacherous and canny, not not really smart. They have risen to the level of their own incompetence‚Äìit‚Äôs the Peter Principle in action.But the thing is that they can do a LOT of damage on their way out, just as a wave receding from the beach can wash away sand castles without a trace.

She was/is a smug, evil person. Trump is a carnival barker.
I‚Äôll take the carny.

                Mencken always struck me as a man whose aim was to please the upper crust by reinforcing their dim view of the proles.  I get where he was coming from, many an opinion including mine of them being not much better, but I have also seen the wisdom in many a poor folk and thus have a deservedly sympathetic view of them on those occasions when I see them as being right.    Sometimes they just get it right.  And with Hillary they got it right.

                The Founding Fathers had no notion of social democracy. They wanted equality *before the law.* They wanted a legal system that would dispense justice to the poor as equally as to the rich. But social democracy‚Äìno.The American Republic was to be an aristocratic or hierarchical republic, with no notion of liberalized suffrage‚Äìlet alone universal suffrage. It was intended to work along the lines of the old Roman Republic‚Äìwith its Senate‚Äìwhere an organic ruling class; a naturally occurring ruling class (meaning landowners) would ‚Äúgovern but not rule.‚Äù There was to be an organic ruling class (landowners) whose members had a sense of *obligation* (connected with *personal honor* and *family honor*) to the commonweal and who would *not* be paid government salaries for their work in elective office. It was a just and workable system, and it DID work for many decades.As to why it failed, the best I can do is to recommend that you read two things: first, Alexis de Tocqueville‚Äôs magnum opus ‚ÄúDemocracy in America.‚ÄùHe was quite prescient. In that book, he remarks that the day would come when Americans would choose *equality* over liberty, and that is exactly what has happened. He explains it very nicely. I recommend that book to you if you would understand America and Americans. The man was a keen observer.And second: the peerless John C Calhoun‚Äôs incomparable ‚ÄúDisquisition on Government.‚Äùhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Disquisition_on_Governmenthttps://www.amazon.com/Disquisition-Government-John-C-Calhoun/dp/1587311852Jefferson understood the dangers inherent in urbanization and in the concentration of wealth. But then came the Industrial Revolution and finance capitalism, which led directly to the War to Prevent Southern Independence (1861 ‚Äì 1865), the purpose of which was to hand possession of the federal government over to the banks and the industrialists, and to reduce the South to the status of an economic colony:https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/why-the-war-was-not-about-slavery/The results of that war were to reduce the once-sovereign states to the status of mere provinces of a unitary state; and to establish urbanization and the dominance of ‚ÄúBig Business,‚Äù precisely the things Jefferson had warned against.Urbanization led away from the old ‚Äúorganic‚Äù ruling class to today‚Äôs ruling class that has only the worst element‚Äôs of Bonaparte‚Äôs meritocracy, such that we now groan beneath the feminine tyranny of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù and ‚Äúcredentialism.‚ÄùBonaparte was able to set up a whole system to support his meritocracy, and the French have managed to make that work, even still today, but the old American system has been pounded‚Äìlike a square peg into a round hole‚Äìinto the current situation in which ‚Äúexperts‚Äù (almost universally incompetent and unfitted for their responsibilities and wholly without any sense of honor) exercise a real tyranny over the whole country. I adduce the Covid superstitionsin evidence.Well, that‚Äôs enough for now.

                    Well, thanks for the comprehensive reply although I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm still no closer to understand the distinction.Universal ‚Äì or ‚Äúliberalized‚Äù ‚Äì suffrage is not necessary to qualify for being a democracy, indeed no countries have universal suffrage, since there are always age limits and such.Social democracy is more of a public fiscal model than a form of government ‚Äì nobody every said ‚Äúa republic, not a social democracy.‚Äù‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù means this: do you vote on laws or not. ‚ÄúRepublic‚Äù means much the same: rule by the people. It does not mean oligarchy or obligation to the commonwealth or freedom from feminism or rejection of urbanization or any of the many points you touch upon. It simply means that the people holds the ultimate power. Like in a democracy.

        That the rich can, and often do, go to any lengths to have their cake and eat it too was described by a friend, a professional arborist and tree man.  He dealt exclusively with the ‚ÄúEast-side‚Äù clientele, where old money and quite a large contingent of nouveaux riches opt to live.  He mentioned that the process of getting these folks to settle their accounts was laborious and exhausting, taking months or even years, with legal action often required.When asked why he didn‚Äôt expand his service to areas where blue collar folks‚Äì who were wont to pay their bills‚Äìlived,  he replied that there wasn‚Äôt enough money involved.

                It is a problem that AA and Heartiste (pbuh) addressed: society has devalued all measures of male smv status except the almighty dollar.  Standing in the community, coming from a good family, being godfearing, or honorable, or having a good reputation ‚Äì all meaningless in the modern sexual market. You either have a fat stack of cash (which you‚Äôll lose 1/2 the time to frivorce) or you trick a woman‚Äôs lizard brain for short term engagements, or you are incel.When you make one thing the sole path to sex/relationships for men, you will get a perverted, demonic, destructive monomoniacal pursuit of that thing.  Blame those who caused this, not the tool they used.

        Unlike in the feudal order, the rich needed to be around the poor, who worked their factories and maintained their cities. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-The dictator or king can be motivated by a sense of duty to his office or his legacy.So which is it? In feudal society the baron and his family were in daily contact with their subjects and knew many of them personally. They basically ate the same foods, celebrated the same holidays and lived in the same general squalor. As the peasants had obligations to the baron, he had responsibilities to them. The biggest change that came with the industrial revolution and capitalism was social mobility. In a feudal world a peasant was likely to remain one his entire life, as were his progeny. That‚Äôs the great gift of capitalism, that some bozo that would have once been fit only to hoe the baron‚Äôs turnips could eventually become a middle manager for a construction contractor or an insurance salesman, not only surviving but perhaps even prospering in a sense. The idea of climbing the social ladder was one of the most important reasons for the lowest classes of Europe to immigrate to the US, just as it is today for others.Originally, the immigration of peasant descendants to the US consisted of farmers, needed to displace the native Americans west of the Mississippi. Since agriculture no longer requires armies of ‚Äúunskilled‚Äù labor, their offspring have joined the blue collar and management ranks. Their attempt at increased social status has been a success. There is no dirt under their fingernails.

                    Did peasants eat meat?Peasants ate very little meat‚Äîtheir diet was wholly based on what they could grow or buy locally. Their meals mainly comprised bread, eggs and pottage (made with peas or beans, vegetables, grains and small amounts of bacon and fish)‚Äîthe original wholefood diet! Scarce meat was reserved for feast days and celebrations.What was the average diet in medieval times?The average peasant‚Äôs diet in Medieval times consisted largely of barley. They used barley to make a variety of different dishes, from coarse, dark breads to pancakes, porridge and soups. After a poor harvest, when grain was in short supply, people were forced to include beans, peas and even acorns in their bread.Think the aristocracy ate meat?  Every fucking meal?   You picked an odd hill to die on, as you are completely ignorant about Medieval life.   When you think about it, you really have to be quite dim to think that at any point in history, the rulers didn‚Äôt live substantially better than the ruled.  I am actually a bit non-plussed  that you are so handicapped‚Ä¶

        The Ruling Class has a Covid problem.The Biden bot announced yesterday that it is ‚Äúup to the states‚Äù to deal with Covid and the virus suddenly is not a federal issue. While Fauci has called for mandatory vaccinations to fly, the Biden bot has said that‚Äôs not going to happen. And therein you see the split.Roughly a third to one-half of the Left has been psychologically broken by Covid. They cannot give it up. Their masters, on the other hand, have started to feel a bit of economic pain over it. The wealthy can afford anything but it has to be available, and that no longer is a given. Further, their inflated assets may begin to deflate next year as a consequence of Covid-related policies having to come to an end to try to decrease the money supply. They are ready to exit the Covid Train and move on to Climate Change or another way to grift and manipulate the madness.So what happens when a third to one-half of the Left is psychologically unable to give up the masks, give up the vaccinations, give up Lord Fauci? They have to be reined in, that‚Äôs what happens. It will not be pretty. Don‚Äôt rule out even little Jonestowns here and there, and mayors at odds with their fellow leftists in the central government. It has the promise to be quite a show. The Ruling Class has set into motion forces it can control only by the most violent and/or authoritarian methods available. Karen as the new Ashli Babbitt? Don‚Äôt discount it.

            Saying it‚Äôs up the states is something I interpret to mean Ruh Roh.
My sense is nothing good will come out of it but rather he‚Äôll essentially deputize the states to grind the people into the dirt.  And The feds meanwhile get to keep their hands clean while they do whatever else, probably try and bomb putin.

                I suspect people are reading too much into that statement about the states. Most likely, the doddering old fool just went off-script momentarily. His handlers will ignore it and continue on with whatever they always intended to do. This will be happily assisted by a compliant press (including Fox News), that will memory-hole the entire thing.

                While that indeed may be the intent, the effect will be to accelerate the divorce of many states if not most from central authorities, which I view as one of the few positive things happening now. The Biden bot may have slipped up, but my guess is not. This is the exit Ruling Class‚Äô initial exit from the Covid train. Vaccines and such still will be touted but with less intensity. I wouldn‚Äôt rule out a declaration of victory late next year, either.As for war with Russia, it would be a debacle and increase the estrangement of Americans from the United States. With any luck, it might even reduce the Imperial Capitol/NYC to rubble, either from the inside or from the air. We will be impoverished if such happens but be relatively free peasants able to get where we need, too.

                    Only in unincorporated areas.   In the city of Los Angeles where I live we are outside the jurisdiction of the sheriff and under the LAPD.  Also, they can sic the bureaucracy on a business if they don‚Äôt enforce the mask mandates, etc.  they can fine them and take away their business licenses.  They can suspend liquor licenses for bars and restaurants, which is what so far has been the m.o.  Plus they have the FTB, the state taxing agency, which makes the IRS look like mother Teresa.  Any Californian will tell you, the last thing you want is the FTB on your butt.Gavin still has plenty of minions to do serious damage if he wants it.That all said, there is momentum building with people in Los Angeles just saying screw it, let them come after me.   Im out of town right now, but before I left that was where things were heading in a big way.

If they‚Äôre ready to jump the Covid train, I doubt it‚Äôs because of money rather than the number and scope of side effects are much worse than we think.
You can fudge statistics only so far and a dead body is very hard to hide ‚Äì they don‚Äôt want to be the last man holding a syringe when the scapegoating starts.

            That‚Äôs going to be easy.
You just need a bit of messaging dripped through ‚Äúthe science‚Äùt o switch the target while keeping the behaviors.
Masks: co2 exhalation. Man that was a cinch.
Vaccines you can just wrap up the actual injections as a finished thing, but keep the passes and certificates which will quickly morph into climate passes (they are even already called green passes in some places)/
Tie them into energy usage, shopping behavior and you can spin the endless fearful sacrifice for many decades I would expect.

        Generally speaking, peoples of European heritage are creatures of innovation, because that is what their environment required of them in order to survive and thrive. And that trait profile is of critical importance going forward. The fish rots from the head. The remedy will necessitate innovation, and the modeling is quite clear. They fear the bolt from the blue simply because they know it will work. And when it begins, emergent behavior will arise and instigate an exodus stampede faster than anyone can imagine. And in the end, less harm, pain, and destruction overall. One caveat, wait for the fog. The probability of success jumps up two orders of magnitude.

        Heard the story of a man who was enormously successful and wealthy in his career.  He got older, as everyone does, and his kids had no interest in taking care of him and he ended up in a home.  The last few years of his life were marred with the indifference and brutality of the nursing home staff, even though this was supposed to be one of the ‚Äúgood ones‚Äù.  If diversity continues, these rich whites will realize that all the money in the world will not make people care about you or even treat you like a human being if they just see you as a bag of money they have no connection to.Rest assured, the same scenario is going to trickle down to standard medical care, and no amount of money will give them competency or empathy.  They are going to be just as willing to put a billionaire in that lung destroying ventilator as a homeless hobo.  It‚Äôs ‚Äústandard of care‚Äù, after all.

            There are home health care agencies that provide a decent level of care at a high cost.  The ultra rich can afford this, although who knows how much longer these companies will be able to find competent staff as well.  The people who have the power to stop this craziness don‚Äôt end up in any nursing home, even the ‚Äúreally good ones‚Äù they turn their homes into their own nursing home.

                I live in Los Angeles and know a number of people who use, and a number of doctors who work for, those ‚Äúconcierge‚Äù practices that make house calls, etc.  They don‚Äôt really offer a higher standard of care, better doctors, the most advanced treatments, etc.  They just offer more hand-holding.  If you‚Äôre a bored rich housewife, your ‚Äúconcierge‚Äù doctor will spend a whole hour listening to you instead of 5 minutes.  That‚Äôs pretty much it.Also, if you have an ear infection or whatever, the concierge doctor will see you immediately or give you a prescription over the phone.  You won‚Äôt have to wait at the emergency room for 14 hours (yes, really) or go to an Urgent Care clinic and wait for 1-2 hours.  Your doctor will speak English as a first language and will be reasonably personable, but you won‚Äôt really get cutting-edge care ‚Äî just better service.  And even then, most rich people don‚Äôt use a concierge doctor ‚Äî they just go to a regular doctor, or to an urgent care clinic, when they get sick. No one goes to the ER for anything other than a truly dire emergency.If a billionaire gets cancer, they go to an oncologist at Cedars-Sinai or UCLA just like everyone else.  If a rich patient has got a lot of friends in medicine they‚Äôll probably be seen faster, but death takes us all and the rich are no exception.  Maybe they can squeeze out an extra year or two at the end of life with very aggressive treatments. And if they‚Äôve led a relatively healthy lifestyle maybe they can live well into their 80‚Äôs or 90‚Äôs ‚Äî a fair number of people who aren‚Äôt rich will make it to 85 or 90,  so some rich people will make it to that age, too.   But they don‚Äôt really have access to ‚Äúspecial‚Äù medical care, everyone dies eventually.Like a lot of ‚Äúluxury‚Äù goods, concierge medicine is more sizzle than steak.

            If you ignored your family in pursuit of money, you may very well suffer in old age‚Äîregardless of accumulated wealth.  Your estrangement being your own fault.  There is a balance, and you must find it.  If you do, your children will make sure that your wealth provides the best comfort possible in your old age.  I‚Äôve not witnessed a single case with folks I know where this was not true, but I‚Äôve heard of a great many where the children could care less and are simply waiting for ‚Äútheir‚Äù inheritance.

                Rubber meets the road:
Would you rather be 65 and have $5 million in the bank, a wife and no kids?
OR
Be 65, have 3 kids, a wife, and 9-10 grandkids who actually care about you but with minimal savings?
Asking for a friend.  Personally I think the answer is obvious by your mid 50s, which is far, far too late to make the choice.

                    Here, in my town, Hispanics are the majority.  They have all the pathologies that come with their station in life, but seem to still be known for family.  Oldsters living with and interacting with children much more common.  Family visiting in hospitals is like a 24√ó7 party.  Maybe making minimum wage and being dependent upon one another has a value we‚Äôve lost sight of?

                        Compsci:  I‚Äôm very hesitant to use Hispanics as a model of anything family related.  Yes, Whites need to re-learn the value of community and interdependence, but in our own way.  Hispanic ‚Äòfamily values‚Äô include a lot of large negatives, such as kids never achieving a sense of independence, refusal to take risks or travel or education but rather to remain home with Mama, and the ‚Äòhangers on‚Äô phenomenon one sees in Africa as well, where someone with a new job or doing well economically automatically owes his large extended family jobs and a share of the largesse.

            The ‚Äúgood homes‚Äù are very expensive and are already full of POC who get paid to act like they‚Äôre white. The normal ones are just angry POC with a chip on their shoulder (old white people be rayciss).
Eventually only the extremely wealthy (Bezos, etc.) will be able to afford proper end of life care.
