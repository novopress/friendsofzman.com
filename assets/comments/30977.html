        Apropos an earlier part of the thread (taking our own side instead of hiding behind magic joggers), just noticed that Chicago Audubon Society dropped the ‚Äòproblematic‚Äô colonizer name and is now the Chicago Bird Society.  First three comments at Gayway Pundit, decrying wokeness and the rewriting White dominated history, quoted . . . you guessed it . . . Thomas Sowell.  Cannot make these things up.  His popularity alone among cuckservatards, aside from his other obvious failings, is reason enough to shun him and his works.

            I used to be a member of the Audubon Society, but then came the day that they discarded their actual purpose, and fervently took a knee to woketardery, evincing their white guilt, and all of that shit.
No longer a member, but still avidly look out for my birds through feeding, and through plantings that provide natural food sources and shelter.

            What I take from the love that white conservatives have for Thomas Sowell is how strongly whites object to judging a person by their racial group.  Does any other race demonstrate this commitment?  Of course not.Conservative whites want to model colorblind thinking to the rest of the world.  But, at some point, if they want to survive, they must realize that their message is not persuasive to non-whites and that most non-whites act as a tribe most of the time.  Their beloved non-whites are not going to reciprocate the same good will to them.  (I know that you know all of this, 3g4m3 üôÇ

        Racism being the great modern evil (only second to anti Semitism) is really a white thing. Having lived for 13 years in non white countries people have no problem noticing differences in race. There might be a little virtue signaling and no one likes racism directed at them but they are very willing to notice the behavior of various races.For example: in Eastern Asia many people have told me they don‚Äôt like working with Indians or having them as customers and they are very specific as to why. This includes the Indian owner of a five star hotel. She hates Indian and Chinese customers. She prefers whites and non Chinese Eastern Asians. She says the Chinese order food, eat it then claim they didn‚Äôt order it so don‚Äôt want to pay. The Indians are always trying to get extra time in the spa for free and when they don‚Äôt get it refuse to pay. And few want Africans in their country because they associate them with crime.Now these same Asians will play the race card in the US because white people are chumps but they take pride in noticing in their own countries.

        Completely off topic but I‚Äôve been wondering if anyone has any thoughts on this.. So if they succeed in sending Trump to jail what happens to his secret service detail? Do they have to report to jail or does he somehow get stripped of protection?

            We are in totally uncharted territory in the political, as well as cultural, economic and demographic, history of the republic so I don‚Äôt think anyone has a definitive answer to that. The secret service field manual chapter on incarcerated ex presidents has not yet been written

                Yeah it‚Äôs really something.  I don‚Äôt know how many secret service agents he has assigned to him as a ex-president but that‚Äôs going to be pretty hard to accommodate in jail.  I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre going to have to be armed right? What an assignment. ‚Äù Bye honey, got to go to jail for the day guard Trump. See you for dinner‚Äù

            How quaint. Such an old fashioned way of thinking.
Secret Service protection is a legal requirement. In our one party state, legal requirements are meaningless. They do whatever they want. Who‚Äôs to stop them? Biden denied Secret Service protection to RFK Jr, who had two of his ancestors assassinated!
A government that can throw the leading candidate for President into jail won‚Äôt let a little detail like suspending his SS protection get in the way.

            I think they all have to go to jail with him. It‚Äôll be amazing, sort of an Apocalypse Now scene where Trump will turn the prison into his own little country/cult with the secret service guys rounding up people to behead and put their heads on spikes. As The Doors ‚ÄúThis is the End‚Äù rises to crescendo Biden will order an airstrike on the prison but the pilots forget everything except ‚Äúdiversity is our strength‚Äù and blow up a nearby hospital instead. Trump is re-instated and declared God-King For Life. As his first act as GK he moves the capitol to Florida and gives Putin the go-ahead to nuke DC‚Ä¶or ‚Äì maybe they just don‚Äôt jail him and that whole indictment circus is a distraction and sideshow‚Ä¶ or ‚Äì they do jail him and the post below about how legal niceties being irrelevant in a one-party state is close to the mark.

        Who said?This is more slight of hand.  Because it is always characterized as being self-evident.  Nobody needed to say it because it is self-evident.Ask any anti-racist (anti-White) ‚Äúwho says‚Äù and it will always come down to it is being consistent with our principles and self-evident.  After all, if everyone is equal, then equal outcomes would naturally flow from such a condition. If equality is true, then an unequal outcome can only be explained by something interfering with the process.There is more slight of hand especially when it comes to blacks. It‚Äôs way more than just equality.   We all have to look at a grey elephant and insist the elephant is actually pink with purple polka dots.  We have to view video of a black fighting with cops or pointing guns at cops and pretend what we are actually seeing is White supremacist cops hunting black people for no reason whatsoever.  We have to look at video of black people rioting or looting Target and pretend that it‚Äôs something else or that we didn‚Äôt see it at all.  We have to pretend that black people moving into your neighborhood and destroying your quality of life is progress, but that White people moving into black neighborhoods are practicing ethnic cleansing. We have to pretend table 43 doesn‚Äôt exist and that prisons are disproportionately black because of racist policing and racist selective enforcing of the law. Noticing anti-White murder is White supremacist conspiracy theory.   All evidence to the contrary is hand waived and denounced as pseudoscientific racism.Even if we could end this tomorrow, which we cannot, the effects of this will be felt for hundreds of years. We are still dealing with the consequences of bad ideas from hundreds of years ago. Bad people eventually die, bad ideas rarely do.Even changing our form of government will not help. Imagine if we changed the entirety of Western Civilization to various Christian theocracies.  Every single denomination of Christianity preaches racial equality and anti-Whiteness.  Christianity isn‚Äôt Christianity anymore. Same would be true if we crowned a king. The would be aristocracy is the most committed to anti-Whiteness.

            Racism is a subset of Jewies warfare on Europeans.Today, far greater than not kowtowing to blacks, greater than anything, is not kowtowing to the stupid story of the 6 million.From, lets say 400 AD into the 1700‚ÄôS, Europeans would tie a fellow European to a stake, heap sulfur on their head, and burn them alive because of not kowtowing to Jewish stories in the right way.Live by the jew; die by the jew.As more people laugh at the jews and their stories, then we will begin to make the world right.  The mess in Middle East and Europe and America, are acting-outs of old jew stories, stupid old stories.

                I think we were at peak Jew before the internet, but the ability of the internet to debunk their histrionic lying is undermining their hold on power.  Their age-old strategy has been to beeline straight to the native elite of a host country, establish leverage over them through moneylending or blackmail, and then control everything that way.  Problem is that now everyone is perfectly aware that all the politicians crying for Israel are just being bribed or extorted to do so, so they aren‚Äôt getting the same ‚ÄúDuh let‚Äôs go bomb towelheads for the Judles so Jesus can come back!‚Äù reaction like they had in 2001.  Once the boomers are all burning in hell there won‚Äôt be any suckers left to listen to the neo-cohens and they might finally be hung out to dry.  Or start a nuclear war and kill everyone out of spite.  Either way.

                    There a far, far more ‚Äòboomers‚Äô than you can ever imagine who are not and never were ‚Äòsuckers‚Äô to the neocohens.
This intergenerational slamming is ubiquitous, utterly unproductive, and right out of the neocohen playbook.
Just one more divisive ploy to keep us attacking each other whilst the nose grins and moves his agenda forward amongst the bickering.

It‚Äôs not tiresome to point out that certain generations have ties to cultural or ethnic or religious beliefs that succeeding generations do not. We point it out so they‚Äôll realize it, and reflect upon it.

                        Nearly every boomer I‚Äôve known believes everything the nightly news tells them is reliable information.  I can spend hours explaining to them exactly why the media gets its narratives from their owners and the government, how they selectively omit information and use weasel words to characterize a story, and how I constantly encounter evidence on the internet that contradicts the media.  Of course the internet isn‚Äôt a valid source of information for boomers because ‚Äúanyone could say anything on there‚Äù.Usually they relent and admit I‚Äôm probably right that the TV lies, then the next day they‚Äôre right back to ‚ÄúHey, that nice Cuomo man on the TV says we need to stick giant q-tips up our noses to stop the covid!‚Äù  Hopeless.

                    Tars ‚ÄìJust a hunch from my one study of Military History but Germany has been THE most maligned &amp; hammered country of the 20th Century. Even before the advent of everybody‚Äôs favorite Austrian ( I say ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù because they can‚Äôt stop bringing him up/talking about him for over 80yrs now) the British had their nose in a twist over the Kaiser‚Äôs audacity to build a blue water navy (‚ÄúBritannia Rules The Waves‚Äù don‚Äôt‚Äôya know!) &amp; the French itching for revenge for getting pummeled in The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 &amp; losing the Alsace-Lorraine. British propaganda labeled German soldiers as cannibals who killed &amp; ate Belgian children‚Äù (this one was so egregious that Erich Maria Remarque even talked about it in his novel ‚ÄúAll Quiet on the Western Front‚Äù), &amp; the British created the heinous German practice of ‚Äúunrestricted submarine warfare‚Äù (I.e. sink-on-sight) since they armed merchant ships with 5-inch guns. Moreover, nor were they above loading passenger liners with illegal ordnance (see ‚ÄúRMS Lusitania, Wreck of‚Äù) then blaming ‚Äúthe blood-thirsty Hun‚Äù for murdering innocent women &amp; children.Fast forward to 1942, when ‚Äúthe blood-thirsty Hun‚Äù had crushed the then largest army in Europe (France) &amp; kicked the British out of Europe 4x (Dunkirk, Norway, Greece, &amp; Dieppe) &amp; who‚Äôs armies then stood @ the gateway to Asia on the Sea of Azov (advance German units made it into Astrakhan) after inflicting 3.5 million casualties on The Red Army in as many months.Just my $0.02 &amp; reading between the lines but seems as though the Allies were thoroughly humiliated &amp; determined that the German should be crushed, never to rise again. Small wonder they get the Austrian corporal &amp; the Holocaust shoved in their face every five minutes.

                    The fedora shtick riffs off the Shrek movie.  Oddly, Shrek and the bible both have a talking donkey.But the point is:Moses going up upon a flaming mountain to the receive Torah in front of 3,000,000 Jews is the moralization the Jews use to justification genocide.  That‚Äôs where it goes.  See below, Anna references that event as their power  source.It‚Äôs sad that It‚Äôs a myth. Living inside their myths isn‚Äôt helping.  I  have enjoyed bible stories myself, but they are stories and those stores are the pretext that facilitates genocide.  Those stories are killing us.Come up with some effective way to de-potentiate them.  Create a new story.Tens of Millions  of Christians are supporting jews to destroy the world.  Stop them.

Its bad enough to have Greenblat and the rest of the fellow whites banging this drum all the time.Most of the major thought leaders in the dissident right are christians of one stripe or another, the few who are NOT are respectful and acknowledge the important social function christianity serves for our people.The ‚Äúpost christian‚Äù west is the epicenter of every form of faggotry and self abasement and the graph is pretty much a perfect negative correlation with rejection of Christianity.  None of this is an accident.You have the same cosmology and corollary moral system as  antifa troons and (((media executives))).

                        Nope, none of that paint applies.  In particular, Antifa and troonitarianism are just Judaic warfare against the goyim.Frustrations are understandable: so many have invested so much into Jewish scrolls.And now over recent years, large caches of historical material have come to light.Materials which show that the Jewish religion relies heavily upon reuse other nation‚Äôs stories.  Their own material is rants and stories about subverting and subjugating and inflicting harm upon Gentiles.Rejoice, there is Good News!Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae.I believe in God the Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.All those Latin words are ancient.  They go back to European Root Words.  They were ancient thousands of years before the Jewish ethnogenesis from backwater hill country Canaanites. Before Moses, had Moses been real. Before Abraham, had Abraham been real.Long before the time setting of those yarns,  Our Ancestors already knew Deum Patrem.Our European Ancestors fanning out to West China and to the Atlantic Ocean knew Him.The Heavenly Father, God the Father is ours.  And always has been.Those Jews have temporally tricked Europeans from our birthright and blessings by claiming that our god was theirs.  But no.Jews only had a foul tempered bumbling tribal pagan storm god from the wilderness of Edom.  And at that, it was more so the family deity of the high priests‚Äô family.Worse, they want to charge us for their Gentile hating heap of hogwash religion.We‚Äôve about given everything away to them, and we are up to our neck with troubles from them.All this time God the Father has been right here.  He is waiting for his people to abandon their fling with that terrible Jewish thing.

                Name one major international denomination of Christianity that is not into the whole race thing on the side of the anti-Whites? Or promoting homosexuals and other degenerates.If you can name them and I can‚Äôt find an example of them doing it, I‚Äôll change my mind.Take the Baptists for example. They excommunicated an entire church from their ranks for the words of a single wrong-thinker (James Edwards)  Or the Methodists. Or the larger Anglican church. Or the Catholic church etc.I‚Äôve always maintained that you can find decent individual churches, like Edward‚Äôs church. That is, a single congregation who ignores the larger national denomination. But whatever denomination they belong to either is ignoring them or disavowing them.PLUS, notice how I phrased it. I said ‚ÄúChristianity is no longer Christianity,‚Äù not that any of this stuff is inherently in Christianity.  The Churches, like every other institution in America have been corrupted.

            Ask any anti-racist (anti-White) ‚Äúwho says‚Äù and it will always come down to it is being consistent with our principles and self-evident‚ÄîYes but us saying ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs good/bad for our people‚Äù is a good consistent principle.

            A lot of it is that people have forgotten the fine art of looking away, giving a little chuckle as they do, and getting back to cleaning up the business spreadsheet, checking the weather forecast, and thinking about how to find room for the new lathe or welding rig in the workshop.My wife and I were watching a video about ‚ÄúBaby Doc‚Äù Duvalier this morning. She‚Äôs bit younger than me and doesn‚Äôt know nearly as much history so she asked about what happened after him. I told her I didn‚Äôt really know how Duvalier met his end but that, from recent news stories, it seemed that Haiti had returned to ‚Äúthe African Norm‚Äù meaning just chaos, violence, and poverty.I offered the fact that African-derived humans were usually a standard deviation below Whites in IQ as a possible reason why places as far flung as Baltimore, Port au Prince, and Lagos (the real one) look so similar. She immediately went to ‚Äúthe IQ studies are biased‚Äù. I just told her she was bullshitting and that there had been research for decades in many different places all showing the same thing. She‚Äôs a very good person but women naturally do this. They NEED the world to be fair and just in some sense.The fact is that it doesn‚Äôt matter. What does matter is preventing good-natured, naive women from forcing the rest of us to waste time, money, and eventually life and limb, engaging in ‚ÄúTikkun olam‚Äù to force their fantasies to come true. We‚Äôve got our own lives to live and Whites at least used to have a good intuitive sense about this. Live and let die ‚Äì or as my friend who were in Special Forces used to say: FIDO. Fuck it and drive on.Women‚Äôs suffrage delenda est.

        20:50  The 50s and 60s media is LOADED with the morality propagandizing. There are some shows that didn‚Äôt have much if any, but other shows that are just dripping with it.  It was on radio too.  The radio program ‚ÄúSuperman‚Äù helped destroy the KKK and turned it into a laughing stock. They actually brag about this.  Just watch a few episodes of The Twilight Zone.Some of it is subtle, but much of it is about as subtle as a punch in the face.If we are to make any progress whatsoever, it has to start with culture, just as they started with culture with the movies, TV, radio and books.  All of our media, mostly podcasts and youtube videos with the occasional book starts with the major premise of ‚ÄúI wish everyone agreed with me. If they did, we‚Äôd win‚Äù  The simple fact of the matter is, you cannot talk someone out of their emotionally held beliefs which are also wrapped up in their identity.We don‚Äôt even have media for children.  If right wing dissidents want to give media to their children, they are stuck with the enemy‚Äôs media.  Whether it‚Äôs fisher price toys, baby‚Äôs first book, Sesame Street or any number of children‚Äôs media, it‚Äôs saturated with propaganda. Most of it is extremely subtle and builds the basis that later lessons will build upon.  This has been true my entire life. The first episodes of Sesame Street are available on youtube or DVDs. You got bombarded with multiculturalism. Black, White and Puerto Rican kids all playing together living on ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù Sesame Street.We are up against a vast machine of what started as equality propaganda which is now explicitly anti-White propaganda. It permeates every facet of our lives, even at work.  Until these attitudes planted in our brains as children and then nurtured throughout our lives in many and various ways can be chipped away, things will continue to get worse as they have for the last 8 decades.

                It‚Äôs called normalization and has nothing to do with simple mindedness.  It‚Äôs not just TV either. It is everywhere. That‚Äôs the point. That‚Äôs ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù  Plus, it‚Äôs just reinforcement. You learned it in school. You picked it up as part of the culture (as a child) just like how you learned to speak.  How the heck is a child supposed to know what they are seeing on the TV or being taught at school is propaganda? They are not equipped to detect or rebut it.All the TV shows you listed were the worst examples that punched you in the face with the message. They were the least effective and easiest to point out as propaganda.  Look at a Rockwell painting and then look at Soviet art. One is excellent propaganda that few if any identify as being propaganda and the other is blatant in your face propaganda that reveals itself to the viewer as propaganda.Our enemies realized very early on that propaganda had to be subtle and it had to be pervasive. They have done an excellent job at hiding it. It is only once you are looking for it that you can even see it. Otherwise, it is so common and so pervasive that you see it everywhere and is unremarkable.

                        They clearly are. For a society where ‚Äúdirt people‚Äù as they‚Äôre called on this blog (not a fan of that term but never mind) can speak their mind, where the government works for their benefit, where playing by the rules gets you ahead. Propaganda for a society that makes sense.
The 1940s was probably a heck of a lot closer to those ideals than we are today but it‚Äôs still propaganda. That said I like his paintings. I would love a society that makes sense in that way

                In hindsight Sandford and Son was like the black version of Seinfeld.  It was pretty honest about the fact that it was a show for black people but the show was amusing and clever enough that white people could fool themselves into thinking they were in on the joke too.I guess I was young enough to have only seen those on re-runs on cable, though ‚ÄúStrokes‚Äù was the only one I could ever remember watching.  There wasLaverne and ShirleyandThree‚Äôs Companytoo, kinda two sides of The Adventures of the Young Roasties (I‚Äôm guessing, never really watched those either).

                Yes, all these things we loved as kids (and which could merit in and of themselves) were part of the matrix; utter propaganda subtle and not.   The old myths and gods of post WWII have to be slayed no matter how painful it may be.
Because the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù as we may remember it were just the beginning (or middle) of the end.

                I try to stay away from the antisemitism, but it is absolutely true that having a TV in your living room is like having a Jew in your living room.
Same is true for radio, books, Twitter, youtube etc.
Allowing a foreign group to take control of such important cultural things was the single biggest mistake (aside from letting them into our countries in the first place) ever made by White people.

                I upvoted Tars‚Äô post here, but I cannot quite agree that TZ is heavily propagandistic. Yes, there are certainly some instances, but in 156 episodes that is bound to be the case. There are also many episodes that valorize traditional white, American morality. The larger point about the toxicity of the pop culture remains unscathed, of course, but there are far more egregious examples of this than TZ.

                You kind of missed the point.  While I certainly agree that old books are better than new books, some of this stuff was in books a 100 years ago. But fine, you can avoid that. But what you will have a hard time finding is media that reinforces a pro-White point of view that isn‚Äôt very poorly done.  At its best, they will push traditional value, not pro-White ones. To the extent they push traditional values, they will not attach it to Whiteness and why this is good.It‚Äôs not enough to be traditional. After all, White people were once traditional. The enemy propaganda slowly chipped away at that.  They turned our virtues into cuckoldry.All you can really do is prepare your children for the tsunami of anti-White propaganda that is everywhere, including peer-pressure.  Is your child prepared for the kids in school who will be explaining why George Floyd is an American hero after the pro George Floyd lesson?  How well will traditional stories prepare them for that?  We need to teach the best of Western tradition and morals and wrap it up in Whiteness.  We also need to teach a skeptical attitude bordering on cynicism.Are you children prepared to understand that every single word of the ‚ÄúEmit Till‚Äù story is complete and utter BS?  Because while you are not sitting around thinking about these types of stories being taught to your children and White people as the universal bad guy, your kid‚Äôs teachers are. Even if you home school, they‚Äôre probably going to go to college.  There is simply no way to preempt any particular story they could theoretically come up with.  None of us ever even heard of ‚ÄúJuneteenth‚Äù 2-3 years ago.This is where tying everything back to being pro-White is necessary, or at least, the only way I can think of to make their skepticism about race and especially anti-Whiteism.

God bless them!Most of us here have rejected the program on our own but it took a while to shake off‚Ä¶  how much better off a kid that had a comprehensive character formation making them proud of their identity.  They‚Äôre starting the game with four pocket aces.

Turn off the screens and tell them the things you know are true.  Build a relationship and be the sort of person theyll naturally respect.  Be an unboomer and help them build their own grub stake.YOU create the environment your children grow up in and need to take responsibility for it.  Popping out sproglings and pushing them out the door for the government to raise is jogger tier.

        ‚ÄúRacism‚Äù is considered the worst moral crime in postmodern society. It is not randomly chosen because it makes it morally and culturally (and in Europe with no first amendment, judicially) illegal to discuss and correct for very central aspects of observable reality such as competence, crime and differences in preference and enjoyment of life.When you can‚Äôt adjust for these things society, like any highly complex system deprived of it‚Äôs corrective feedback mechanisms, will start to break down. But it doesn‚Äôt end there; ‚Äúanti racism‚Äù targets whites in the most extreme ways. While every other group is encouraged to fight for their interests whites are both denied to exist and at the same time blamed for all the ills of history. We are told to worry about the welfare of indigenous people of the Amazon but it is officially not a problem that Swedes are rapidly becoming a minority in  Sweden. Israel is the national home for the Jewish people. But to say that Germany may be the same for the German people is a jailable felony in Germany. An America in 1860 that was only a quarter slave society based on population and probably didn‚Äôt produce one tenth of a per mill of America in 1960, is said to be built on the back of slavery.This complete disregard for logical consistency gives the game away. ‚ÄúRacism‚Äù is a mental weapon used to preempt natural defensive instincts in whites, as any group would feel in the face of such an onslaught. And it is wielded with genocidal hatred and intent against Europeans in Europe, North America and Oceania.We are on the receiving end of genocide by new means. And we must realize that. And people who accuse whites of genocide, whether they be white or non white, are small cogs in the most ambitious campaign of ethnic extermination in history. Even for an agnostic like myself that makes them the servants of Satan.It is also extremely unlikely that we can find redress within the current system. But strategies for dealing with this are another story and frankly I am not sure how to do that. First thing first: ‚Äúracism‚Äù is a mind weapon used to exterminate the European world.

        I think I mentioned this interview on a recent OT post. Taylor does a masterful job.He keeps laying it right back on the table and Brodow ignores it. The one thing that Taylor could have done that we should do when we have the chances to, is to focus in on the colorblind myth. Point out the stark reality that the Civil Rights legal regime is hyper color aware. This anti-white racism is now more overt because they are emboldened by The Great Replacement. This is just the next logical step toward our Dispossession. Point out the simple logic of basic game theory where one group is disorganized, sees itself as not a group and playing by rules and the other group(s) are highly organized and group aware and play by the the rules of ‚Äì whatever it takes to win.These guys are just whining that it is unfair and that the other guys are not playing by the colorblind ideal. Then you ask them, what game theory predicts in this circumstance. If they can‚Äôt figure it out you help them ‚Äì subjugation and potential annihilation.You tie it all together. Colorblind Lie. The Great Replacement. Game Theory. The Likely Outcome. Then the solution. Colorblind is suicide and we must take our own side. Brodow says it himself, ‚ÄúThe War On Whites.‚Äù Then he forgets about the war and shows up unarmed and a request that everyone just be nice and play fair. If it is war Brodow and Rufo and the others, then you better act like it.Per some other posts, the ‚ÄúConservative‚Äù Seven of Sowell, Williams, Riley, MacWhorter, Owens, Hawkins, and that fat guy with the grey goatee are a cope. When is one of us with power and influence going to stand up and stop hiding behind a non-white to take up our cause. If you are reading this, an army of pissed off and determined people in the tens of millions is going to roar, have your back and many will go shoulder to shoulder with you. You have a historic opportunity that is even greater than the existential threat presented to King Alfred and his nobles.What are you waiting for?

                Yes. They can use it against Trump because he is not that man that I describe. Trump is so busy ‚Äúcentering‚Äù a bunch of Diamond and Silks in every speech and photo op he is hopeless.
The real deal, an American Dries van Langenhove will arrive. When he does he will withstand the storm because tens of millions of people who have been dying for him will ensure he withstands it.

        Who says?  The short answer is:  our friends in the tiny hats.  They  immigrated to USA in the early and middle  2oth century, and  developed a huge case of butt-hurt because they didm‚Äôt fit in.  Rather than feel gratitude for be allowed here in the first place, they concocted a (‚ÄúKalergi‚Äù) plan to swamp Christendom with other races and faiths, so that their huge noses, tiny hats, and self-important crassness would be less conspicuous.  being a Pharisaical, rule-based bunch to begin with, they found it easy to rewrite all our cultural norms to advantage themselves.  I still remember the territorial markers they threw down in the sixties, in advertising, film,  comedy, and other media.  It was clear even then that an alien presence was announcing itself, and it has grown in influence since then, to the point that it is the invisible water we swim in.  it makes no logical sense because it never was about logic, fairness, or OUR traditions.  If was always warfare in disguise.  The declining numbers of Christians and whites shows that we are losing that war.

            Blaming Jews for the West‚Äôs morality issues is ridiculous. There‚Äôs a straight line from Enlightenment thought, as espoused in the Declaration of Independence, to an open borders welfare state worshipping societies ‚Äòmost oppressed‚Äô. Neofeudal Liberalism (who frequently comments here and various other forums) has written much about the Egalitarian ratchet effect, and I agree that the root cause of this in the West is Christian morality.

                And yet the West managed to soldier along just fine for almost 2,000 years after the advent of Christianity. To the extent Christianity is fundamentally egalitarian‚Äìand this is a topic of hot debate‚Äìit may have provided one precondition for the West‚Äôs collapse, but it was hardly sufficient on its own.

                    It absolutely didn‚Äôt ‚Äòsoldier on just fine‚Äô for 2,000 years. It was always a slave and victim morality, worshipping the weak rather than having a strong, warrior culture as found in Greece and Rome. It‚Äôs always been about turning the other cheek, doing nothing (aka trust the plan) because your reward is in the afterlife, and bring in the refugees!
But yes, perhaps there is a genetic component that made Westerners susceptible to this line of thinking, they did historically evolve in environments that required trusting others.

A large amount of the Crusades was just Christians attacking other Christians.  It wasn‚Äôt the great based Catholic Exterminatus against Muzzies of our fantasies.  I think the Czechs had to fight off like four crusades just because the Hussites figured out the ‚Äúhey these priests are just collecting bribes‚Äù thing before everyone else.  So really it was the same European tendency to start wars among themselves over moralfagging as usual.

                        Utter nonsense. In the main, Western culture was inegalitarian and warrior-based at least until the French Revolution. And even after that, those older structures persisted to a very significant degree into the 1960s. In other words, throughout the vast majority of its history, the West was the very opposite of what it is today.

                    As someone who for historical heritage reasons would have preferred Europeans to have retained indigenous belief systems instead of importing monotheistic Semitic religions from the ME in the form of Christianity, I have to concede that Europe under the Cross obtained undisputed global hegemony. So Christianity cannot empirically be an impediment to strategic and demographic success.

                    Christianity is egalitarian is the sort of idea that would only occur to a low church protestant in very recent years.When you go to church and literally bow and kiss the hand of people LITERALLY called HEIRARCHS this is not the sort of idea that occurs to you.Its also a slander on traditional protestantism which was happy enough with kings and bishops or even just the elders of the community leading things.  Christianity is not rock bands and self help books although one could be forgiven for thinking that NOW in terms of what is allowed to be mainstream.Education wasnt previously spinsters telling your son to castrate himself, music wasnt joggers repetitively rhyming about their penis, ads werent mudshark girl bosses insulting potential customers.Everything is being poisoned now, at least everything that the (((media))) allows to exist in the public square.  Not a reflection on the thing itself

                It is not ridiculous.  It is accurate.  It may have been built into the Enlightenment cake, but respect for Western civilization and tradition allowed that cake to be kept in the fridge and only small portions consumed.  Someone destroyed the respect for Western Civ and its traditions, and replaced every meal with this cake after adulterating it with fake ingredients.To some extent, yes ‚Äì the West is to blame for allowing it to happen.  But that does not diminish the fault of the perpetrators any more than leaving your car unlocked on MLK Blvd excuses the jogger who stole it.

                Having pondered the JQ for some time, I‚Äôve concluded that it is neither as delusional or paranoid as some dissidents who are allergic to it, insist. Nor as omnipotently explanatory as it‚Äôs most zealous advocates claim. It seems relevant but not sufficient.

                    It‚Äôs women voting.  We practically doubled their lifespan after the discovery of germ theory, gave them the right to vote, and passed affirmative action laws cramming them and their influence into every institution from government agencies to corporations and marketing departments.  Now they outlive us and outvote us.  (((The usual suspects))) have the exact same personality types as women, which is why it‚Äôs hard to tease out who is influencing who.  High openness, high agreeableness, high neuroticism all explain what‚Äôs been happening to our civilization pretty accurately.  Mix in a growing POC population and we‚Äôre essentially taking power away from white men, the guys who built everything, and giving an outsized influence to those who achieved nothing throughout history, women and POCs.

                it‚Äôs a plain fact that this tiny minority dominates ever important western institution:  banking, media, the academy, law, and most governments (including our own).  They even brag about it themselves, though they attribute it to hard work and intelligence rather than iron-clad in-group preference among themselves, combined with weaponizing the host society‚Äôs morality and culture against itself.   We should not have allowed this, but shoulda-woulda-coulda isn‚Äòt going to help us now.  Especially when a lot of people (like you) remain in denial.

                    Whenever I think about this stuff I tend to reflect that losing your country and culture to the Huns, or the Vikings is at least understandable. Losing it to Mort Finkelstein Attorney at law and his drugged out cousin Lenny who makes dirty movies and rents run down apartments to the Puerto Ricans just seems like a special kind of pathetic. Maybe that was it. The old straightforward means of conquest wouldn‚Äôt have worked but this roundabout passive aggressive approach was something we had no plan for.

        The Smithsonian museum apologized for saying hard work, rational thought is White Culture. These people are ridiculous and hilarious.Far too many true crime podcasts jumped onto the anti-racism wagon, particularly after St. George Floyd. When the stories are introduced as occurring in a safe area with low crime, they could save time by just referring it to as an area where White people live. When they begin by discussing neighbors hearing gun shots but not calling the police because those sounds are a daily occurrence‚Ä¶ Or maybe they can‚Äôt hear over the sound of the chirping smoke detectors.Those fantastic discussions with Gregory Hood and Chris Roberts were ‚ÄúLeft, Right, and White‚Äù, by the way.Have a great weekend and enjoy October‚Äôs Bright Blue Weather.

        Once upon a time in our species‚Äô evolutionary history, ancient wisdom was passed down through generations; and if you learned it, internalized it, and applied it, it more-often-than-not enhanced your ability to survive and thrive in your local environment. This meant that you typically got to pass on your genes to offspring, and over time, your cohort of the species benefited. This was a mechanistic outcome that required no other basis for validity or justification; it was just the natural reality of life on Earth.But the mechanics of passing on wisdom between generations is a man-made invention; and the better its done, the better the outcome. History demonstrates that this teaching process works best when there is consistency of messaging, frequent repetition, and a punishment/reward feedback loop. Those are the essentials, but there are many ways to skin that cat. For example, religion works very nicely to accomplish these goals. All the great religions have a tome which embodies message consistency. Most require repetitive recitation, gestures, and attendance. And praise/penance provides an effective feedback reinforcement. Finally, the concept of a god solves all the problems of unknowns and inconsistencies.Where am I going with this? The concept of ‚Äúmoral authority‚Äù is an ephemeral abstraction and not a transcendent reality. What persists is what works. Get off your high horse and smell the coffee. Reality doesn‚Äôt give a shit about your moral arrogance and rationalizations. You are not God Emperor of the Universe.

            Abstract morality is a very tricky subject, and I‚Äôm still working out my position on it. Tentatively, I believe that there is an abstract absolute morality that is timeless and immaculate. It is probably rooted in the Godhead, although secular types could see its basis in Platonic forms.At any rate, human beings cannot know absolutely absolute morality. We don‚Äôt have the intellectual puissance, and language itself may be inadequate to the task of expressing absolute morality, even if we could grasp it. The only thing we can do is grope toward absolute morality in the hope of approaching it. But the knowledge that we can never reach it should caution us against imposing our moral system upon others, let alone on pain of mass destruction and death.And that brings me to the point that different cultural groups‚Äìbasically races and sometimes ethnicities‚Äìdevelop different moral systems that they believe produce the best results for themselves. (They may also believe them in an absolute sense.) Now all of these moral systems are flawed to one degree or another, but the fact that they are believed fervently and are rooted in millennia of continuous discrete existence means that attempting to impose an alien system upon them is not merely foolhardy, but in most cases harmful. The propensity to do so is probably the West‚Äôs greatest historical failing, and it persists to this day.

                You are describing faith in an ideal. Which is another way of saying that you choose to adhere to this ideal despite any doubts or inconsistencies that may arise in your life. And you are likely descended from ancestors that had similarly adopted this mode of thinking, adhered to local ancient wisdom, lived to reproduce, and pass on their genes to you. As such, the proclivity toward a ‚Äúfaith‚Äù like behavior may well be encoded in your genes. Therefore, this behavior (mental habit actually) is an innate part of who you are, and not a volitional choice per se. That is how you get to an ongoing moral framework which appears eternal in the moment.

                    You are far more deterministic than I. I fully accept that genetic structures create pronounced tendencies for cultural groups, but I also believe there is room for individual freedom‚Äìand more particularly, independent thought‚Äìwithin broader genetic bounds. My race tends me toward general modes of behavior, but does not necessitate that I be a Platonist, a Christian or a postmodernist.

                    There do seem to be some rather universal moral absolutes.  The details may differ.  I am not aware of any group that, for example, espouses the killing of the innocent just to kill the innocent.
Now, groups may differ on who qualifies as innocent, and whether there is a greater justification for killing them, but not on the basic premise (of course, there are always individual sociopath outliers, but they are not the society).

                My conclusion was that the only absolute is Natural Law.  Human morality works or doesn‚Äôt based on the degree to which it comports with Natural Law.
As an example, jerking off doesn‚Äôt make God, Odin, or Saint Floyd angry since those are all allegorical constructs that we use to make the moral code relatable by anthropomorphizing nature.  Jerking off does lower your motivation to go out and find a nice lady with whom to make White children though, so with respect to nature‚Äôs drive to propagate yourself it is sinful.

            For some reason, probably the part about internalizing, your post made me think of Walter Ong. Most ancient wisdom was passed through generation orally, not textually, resulting in a much more intimate experience between generations and storyteller/audience in the process of internalizing. If you have never read Ong‚Äôs Orality and Literacy, you may want to pick up a copy. The text talks about the fundamental difference between primary oral and primary literate cultures. The book is fascinating.

                All nurturing begins as verbal because literacy comes much later in life. And societal scale literacy has only been with us for a few centuries. Most religious training is conducted in a class-like setting in which oral messaging is still primary. Religious tomes are a codification of uniformity in messaging more so than a text book for teaching. Most people read the bible only once, if that.

                    Yes, but the impact of literacy is incalculable upon our view of language. You should really check out his book.  From our youngest days, language has a visual component (reading to child). For oral culture, this does not exist, etc.

            ‚ÄúWhere am I going with this? The concept of ‚Äúmoral authority‚Äù is an ephemeral abstraction and not a transcendent reality. What persists is what works.

                I think you misunderstand my comment. My argument is that morality is a man-made invention and not an eternal and immutable law of nature like gravity or the speed of light. It exists and persists whenever it ‚Äúworks‚Äù in the sense of enhancing the survive and thrive imperatives of a specific cohort of the population. Yes, there can be a lot of overlap all across the planet, but not a one size fits all.

        ‚ÄúThis new moral framework, however, does not rest on a legitimate moral foundation.‚ÄùYou mean it does not rest on any kind of empirical foundation. I‚Äôm reminded of Andrew Anglin‚Äôs post that there‚Äôs only one breed of dog:https://dailystormer.in/theres-only-one-breed-of-dog-the-dog-breed/Speaking of research into race differences, I was intrigued to find that it‚Äôs active in Israel. I stumbled upon Raphael Falk‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúZionism and the Biology of Jews‚Äù a few days ago. Falk is an Israeli geneticist. If a German geneticist was doing the same kind of work in Germany the shrieks and howls of the Boeoticians would be deafening.But coming back to the subject of today‚Äôs post, the stale old adage is that race is skin-deep. Yet all our experience points unequivocally in the opposite direction: it‚Äôs definitely more than skin-deep.

            No, I mean it does not rest a recognized moral foundation. None exists within the Christian context. It obviously cannot exist with Judaism. That leaves tradition, custom and mutual consent. We can say that actively discriminating against people on the basis of race goes against our sense of fair play, but we stop well short of saying fair play demands you live next to a family of Korean ginger midgets.Frankly, race and the rest of the items in the culture war are way to keep the busy bodies in the managerial class busy. In a better age, these people were sent off as missionaries or as mercenaries in foreign wars. Now they are sent to a grievance studies department or the HR department of your company, tasked with tormenting the Dirt People.

        Events either will force Normiecons/Grillers‚Äô hands or they will perish. These people cannot be deprogrammed in the conventional sense but they either will be forced into reality or they will suffer from their racial delusions. The rest of us (and this also includes them, even if they cannot yet acknowledge the reason) need to continue to sort and separate because it is all imploding and there is nothing that will reverse the inevitable collapse. The Ruling Class might try to lessen the oppression of white dhimmitude as a Hail Mary but they already are screwed, too.As an aside, how long until the Smithsonian has its first drive-by in the event that has not happened yet? I would wager there at least have been lesser forms of chimp-outs .

            What I have noticed since this manufactured ME crisis is that Normicon can become quite bloodthirsty.  At least the ones I know talk that way with regard to ‚ÄúWiping out‚Äù  the Palestinians.
Now if we could get them to have that attitude when it comes to their own destruction as much as they have it for Israel, we might have something.

                    Eh, but once the full-blown rioting starts, their hatred for Whitey would take over.I live near Philadelphia, and consequently have as a reference point the Philadelphia Museum of Art, located at the end of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway but, as are most things in Philly, located perilously close to large concentrations of Australopithecines. If the Board were anything other than craven adherents of The Narrative, they would be laying plans to move the collection out of this city.Oh, and not incidentally, the world-famous Barnes Collection, with its fabulous collection of Impressionist art, was strong-armed out of its original, much safer site beyond the city limit of Philadelphia onto a location on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway near the PMA, largely through the connivance of former Philly mayor, (((Ed Rendell))). Gee, thanks, Fast Eddie, for making this collection vulnerable to the chimp out to outdo all chimp outs, too. All it took was conniving to overturn the will of Alfred Barnes, who went against the critics of the day to develop this institution. (In the words of Devo, ‚Äúteachers and critics all dance the poot‚Äù, true then, and even moreso now‚Ä¶)

                    While the Smithsonian anti-racism sideshow is in part calculated to soothe black sensibilities, its target audience is Post-Modern whites who feel the need to self-flagellate at freak exhibitions like this one. I don‚Äôt know for certain, as previously noted, if there has been a drive-by at the Smithsonian yet, but I will gaurant-fucking-tee you that there are busloads of whites who claim their lives were changed by it. A few generations ago these same types were into crystals. With Kendri going tits up, they may be looking for new masochistic kinks. We‚Äôll see if that is the start of a trend.

        The race-aware folks who remain colorblind CivNats are a fascinating group. It‚Äôs why I still haunt the comments section of Steve Sailer.Once you understand that they remain stuck in the old morality, it makes a lot more sense. They square the circle of racial differences and colorblind civic nationalism by falling back to libertarianism. ‚ÄúSure, there are average racial differences, but individuals of every race call fall anywhere on the bell curve so if you just treat everyone equally under the law in a colorblind way, society will be fine.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs how Sailer can be against the anti-white agenda while not being pro-white. Indeed, he, like Charles Murray, is fervently against whites joining the identity politics game, probably because he knows that once that happens, his colorblind civic nationalism dream is truly dead. (It‚Äôs already dead, but he can‚Äôt see that.)Their argument has a number of obvious practical flaws, but when you point out those flaws to them, they act like any blue-haired Leftist by pointing and sputtering about you being a racist, i.e., they say that I‚Äôm bad because I‚Äôm going against their morality.I used to have a lot fun getting a rise out them, but that gum is losing its flavor. They‚Äôll never change because their morality allows them to feel intellectually superior to both the Left and the Right (‚ÄúI‚Äôm smart enough and clear-headed enough to notice racial difference while they‚Äôre not.‚Äù) and morally superior to racists like me.

            Spot on. The conservative who has black friends believes himself to be the most enlightened, free-thinking, liberal of them all. To his right are unreconstructed races of every political ideology ‚Äî horrible, horrible people, all of them, and not to be tolerated. To them, anyone who speaks about race *is* racist.I‚Äôve slowly come to believe, with age and observation of the ideas that remain most salient in the minds of my normie friends from childhood indoctrination and education, that the colorblind myth planted in the 1970s and 1980s was the most potent seed of all. It IS their worldview; they see the world through a race-based ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see race‚Äù delusional prism. And this infuses ALL of their other beliefs, because, well, anybody expressing an opinion on anything has skin color, and that‚Äôs the first thing the NormieCon looks for to determine how he‚Äôs going to respond to what‚Äôs being said ‚Äî can they leverage it to a point where they can accuse the other person of racism?This is endemic now, it‚Äôs everywhere, you never know who‚Äôs going to drop it on you in any conversation. Unfortunately I‚Äôm beginning to fear that only time and the grave solves this problem. You can‚Äôt cure two or three generations of a worldview they‚Äôve held since adolescence.

                    Absolutely. My maternal grandmother was the same about Oprah. I think that she, and doubtless millions of others of her generation, watched Oprah in expiation of the ‚Äúsin‚Äù of their former racism. They didn‚Äôt have the stomach to actually go forth and scrub the tootsies of the Hutus in da‚Äô hood, but they could tell all and sundry just how much they looooved Oprah. Just another form of virtue signaling, alas, and all borne of anti-white guilt tripping.

            Sailer doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúnotice‚Äù the effect of the West rapidly becoming more brown, and therefore more race-centric.  He‚Äôs stuck in the 1980‚Äôs and the demographics then.  (He even said the other day that he‚Äôs not very knowledgeable about music after the 80‚Äôs.)
With the quick demographic change, everything will increasingly be about race.  Whites are now attacked more than ever on the basis of race, so defending ourselves and advocating for ourselves under the same terms is justified and the only way forward.  How does a ‚Äúnoticer‚Äù not understand that?

        Ahh the great (and I am not being snide) Thomas Sowell.  Whenever conservatives bring him up as their foil against unpleasant race thinkers like myself (‚ÄúI‚Äôd gladly live in a neighborhood of Thomas Sowells‚Äù, etc.) I always have to ask them if they don‚Äôt think its odd that the only example they can find to negate the observation of group differences is a 90-year old black man.

            In regards to Thomas Sowell yes, he has written quite a few books (I have read most of them) that give a wealth of knowledge and insights, especially his historical analysis. But I agree entirely with you that it is tiresome to hear the worn-out canard from vanilla conservatives that hold him up as a universal example.
When the number of ‚ÄúConservative‚Äù intellectual blacks can be counted on one hand across the entire country, they may as well be unicorns, not the future trend.

                I would lightly disagree as he‚Äôs probably just the black version of the guy Z talked about on the podcast, a turbo-normie who will make all his observations fit into his canned worldview that happens to be the same worldview of everyone else that he knows.  His rosy view on black dysfunction backs this up since it would appear that he views lesser skilled blacks the same way whites usually view lesser skilled whites: that a lack of effort accounts for their plight.

                        Oh, here we go again with the ‚ÄúJesus and his disciples were Jews‚Äù shit.Jesus was tortured to death at the request of the Sanhedrin because he rejected the fundamental principal of Judaism ‚Äî that Jews are the ‚ÄúChosen People of God‚Äù ‚Äî and instead believed that any righteous man, Jew or Gentile, would be saved by God. Not in the ‚ÄúPromised Land of Israel,‚Äù but in the afterlife.He also exposed the temple-coin scam that the crooked Jew Pharisees and rabbis were running and cost them a lot of money. So, like the gangsters that they were, they had him offed.Properly understood, Christianity is anti-Judaism.

                    Some man in the airport says something ignorant. The usual response: Jews want to kill Christians. Start Pogrom!That man in the airport also does not know that at the time Torah was given, the Christians were 1500 years away.Christianity improved the world greatly, as they brought the morality of 10 commandments to the 100s of millions of people.But the people who preferred to remain Jewish have not believed that Jesus was a messiah and they wait for their own.For that believe they were burned alive, expelled and made 3d class citizens.To each one : their own.

                    The first journalistic moral panic about ‚ÄúAI‚Äù was about the inability of our future robot overlords to understand that pictures of black women aren‚Äôt pictures of men. This was back when women were still a thing.The later outrage about pictures of black people being labeled as pictures of gorillas was the big one, but it‚Äôs easily explained as the ‚ÄúAI‚Äù categorizing photographs, not animals. Optionally, it can then be decided that photography was a racist invention‚Äîan invention whose purpose, now finally revealed by AI (the repressed mind of whiteness), was ‚Äúproving‚Äù that black people and gorillas look alike! (This has in fact been decided. Kids learn it in school, if they go to a Good School.)But as almost every tranny murder demonstrates, *nobody* can reliably tell black men and women apart.Future Sailer column: the Great Trooning (or whatever he calls it), whose vanguard emerged from Silicon Valley, conveniently allows AI to ignore the racially fraught subject of biological sex as apparent difference. Follow the money!

        So, a Taylor‚Äôs answer to the present situation is roll back everything to 1950,  Johnson wants to make a white homeland, etc etc.
What is your style of dissidents answer for the white mans current dilemma?
Our situation is not going to get better, no matter what happens next election.  Are there any solutions?  Answers?  Plans to survive as they hunt us, which they have clearly started to do?
We can talk about things until we are blue (black) in the face.  If we don‚Äôt start approaching things with some sort of actual plan, where will we end up?

            With gen-Z demographics the racial makeup issue is lost. The only solution now is create de-facto homogenous communities, which means making freedom of association a thing again. Since this will never happen legally, the only recourse is euphemisms and code-words. Think ‚Äúbetter schools‚Äù on steroids.As D.C. grows more corrupt and insular, it‚Äôs going to become impossible to strike down all the hydra heads as they come up around their empire, leading to communities doing things that are technically illegal, but due to them being able to actually function (and a little bit of under the table bribing), the locals look the other way.

                This is spot on. There will be tremendous anti-white oppression, but it largely will be impotent toward the end. The emergence of Colony Ridge garrisons filled with illegal aliens in the boondocks is one futile attempt to plug these holes.
D.C. is a dead letter. The rest of the world realized this some years back, and that glaringly obvious fact has become undeniable now even to CivNats. It is an unavoidable, self-inflicted trainwreck now and what follows is all that matters.

                You‚Äôre not wrong, but this won‚Äôt happen.  There are already a lot of communities attempting to do this now, but against the will of the people, migrants are being dropped into those town.  Blacks are being subsidized so they can ‚Äúafford‚Äù nicer homes in these areas.  TPTB are forcing it on those communities, and if you resist, your life is destroyed.  It is a seemingly unstoppable force.  No matter how many verified victories reality demonstrates, the cognitive dissonance is far too great.Even when Whites are completely deracinated (almost there), they will still be blamed.  Long after the last remnants of Whites are gone from AINO, the failures that ensue will ultimately be blamed on Whites.  It truly is a remarkable thing.

            There are innumerable examples of peoples surviving as ethnic or religious minorities within societies ruled by others. Christians in the Middle East, Mennonites and other nonbelievers in Russia and the West, and Afrikaners in post-Apartheid Southern Africa are just a few examples. But virtually any large state contains such unrepresented groups. We need to study and learn from them. The problem with the AmRen/VDare approach is we have to get beyond the idea that we are the silent majority, who just need to be woken up to the biological realities of race, etc. to bring about sensible solutions to our problems. Even if we were still the majority, our rulers would not allow our political expression. People have been dealing with a lack of empowerment for time immemorial. We must do the same.

            It is a tricky thing.  My personal view is as follows:Overall solution is freedom of association de facto first, then de jure God willing.1. Do not have much hope of righting the ZOG ship at this point, although it could be a slow burn which gives time to prepare.2. Prepare: (a) move away from the diversity if you can (at least from the hottest zones), (b) stockpile what you can, (c) build IRL community with your neighbors ‚Äì simple as just getting to know them as a start.3.  Survive: Not exciting or glamorous, but the daily grind of surviving and as TomA often says, be as ready as you can when things go south.4. Also boring, but act locally ‚Äì national politics is simply a distraction.  Your local school board, mayor, city council and sheriff have more impact on day-to-day than Biden or Trump, in particular when the ZOG train hits the wall.  This is where I part company with the no vote crowd: while voting for Pres or Senator is generally a waste of time, not so much for local office/issues (towns often have referendums ‚Äì we got rid of red light cameras in our town through one).  The smaller community you live in, the better. Statewide office ‚Äì YMMV.5. Pray.  Can‚Äôt hurt (and helps settle the soul).As is often said, this didn‚Äôt happen overnight, it won‚Äôt be fixed overnight.  And the fix is generally going to be a long slow boring slog (maybe punctuated once in a while).

        The typical line of dissedebts like Taylor is that race was so self  evident to our ancestors that they need not discuss it. I think that is more or less true.So how did this switch happen in the 50s and 60s?  In terms of history, the switch between whites understanding race so intuitively that it need not even be defended in books and magazines to being zealous anti racists happened  in a historical blink of an eye, within 20 years.Guess the mind of the white man was so softened and confused he was ripe for a new virtue and a new sin.I think I‚Äôm going to skip the Taylor interview. I can only get enraged  so many times a day. Intermarriages with other races is racial suicide.

            Imo it started in 1871. Germany had to be kept down, even at the cost of destroying Western Civ and its people. Why that was so important, I can only speculate, but it seems like part of a larger dynamic that goes back to antiquity to me.

            The change in understanding race happened so quickly because everyone was immersed in watching TV, movies and sportsball.In 1947 Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in baseball.  Later on there were fun, cool black guys on TV like Sammy Davis Jr. and Bill Cosby (at the time).Then in the early 70‚Äôs the Norman Lear sitcoms with a lesson to learn were popular, along with numerous other shows that all contained racism-is-bad content, whether subtle or not.  That continues today, except much of it is more blatantly anti-white.Virtually everyone in the West has spent thousands of hours in front of the TV absorbing their programming.  It‚Äôs understandable that something as obvious as race realism is pushed aside by a lifetime of a widespread antiwhite agenda.

                Very good. Far too many people overlook sports‚Äìand pop music‚Äìas salients for Hutuphilia and ultimately anti-white racism as well. Television viewing, which became commonplace in the 60s, was a force multiplier.

                I remember watching some sitcom as a little boy in the 70s, which was set in an apartment in New York.  Some black man climbed into their apartment through the window.  For a moment, all the white characters were scared.  Then they discovered that he was a nice guy and there was some reason for him to climb through the window.  Everyone laughed and relaxed.
The script writers shamed the white characters for being concerned that a black man climbed through their apartment window.

            Ideologically, there was more change in America from 1964 thru 1969 than from 1969 to the present. We can all offer some explanations, but I doubt any of them are sufficient to explain this truly remarkable transformation. It is surely one of the greatest mysteries of modern history.

                Yes, I have thought about this, too, having been in college during the time you mentioned.  We are coming up on the SIXTIETH anniversary of JFK‚Äôs assassination. There was a societal full stop that occurred that day. Smaller one in June ‚Äô68 when RFK was murdered in LA. With these two Catholics gone, suddenly we were free to get on board with Abortion‚Äìa word that was never said aloud in civil society until the late 60s‚Äìand all the other sex-related activities that did NOT promote traditional family values. Obviously the Kennedy men had not been terribly secretive about living lives that did not follow customary morality, but they were excused to some extent by society a. admiring WWII heroics by JFK and his glamorous First Lady, then b. feeling sorry for them and their distraught families, which led to our emotional wreckage and acceptance of the bad stuff as punishment in the following decades. Church-going has plummeted in the US since then, too. I predict some Protestant denominations won‚Äôt be around in 20 years. Ted Kennedy, besides becoming the ‚ÄúLion of the US Senate,‚Äù also turned into an avatar for strange new policies for things like abortion.

        Good show. I happened to listen to that Jared Taylor podcast. It was a little surprising when one of the solutions to the black problem offered by the guest was more interracial marriage. The guest laid out all the facts, then came to a completely opposite conclusion than what was expected. As for myself, I no longer concern myself if somebody thinks me a racist. That particular slur has no teeth to it like it once did.

            That is because most White people don‚Äôt interact with the average POC on a regular intimate basis.  The POCs they do interact with are generally ‚Äúcurated‚Äù for them and the undesirables they simply avoid.  But this will soon change ‚Äì unfortunately probably too late.

            They may publicly disagree with us, but that‚Äôs only because to publicly agree with us would be social suicide. Dissembling to survive can have some effect on one‚Äôs real core beliefs‚Äîsee Timur Kuran‚Äôs ‚ÄúPrivate Truth, Public Lies‚Äù‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also sometimes just a matter of social survival. And for females there‚Äôs not much difference between social survival and literal survival. You have to be very resolute and strong‚Äîlike someone like Jared Taylor‚Äîto swim publicly against the tide for such a long time and take the abuse with sangfroid.Women generally follow the principle lain down by Bin Laden, when he said everyone loved a strong horse. Most women will publicly identify as whatever is popular and supported by the current winners of the system. They‚Äôre more morally inert and less risk-willing, for a host of biological issues not relevant here. We shouldn‚Äôt try to win over the women, at least rhetorically. If we win the fight, the women automatically follow.

        ‚ÄúRacism‚Äù appears to just be one‚Äôs functioning genetic immune system. It lets one know when they‚Äôre in the presence of friends or foes. Bemoaning it‚Äîor trying to shed one‚Äôs biases in favor of their ingroup and distrust of outgroups‚Äîis probably as dumb as an animal trying to shed its evolutionary adaptations. And no animal‚Äîno matter how primitive‚Äîis that dumb or suicidal. The good news is that young white males appear to be much less amenable to the mindf*ck than their forebears. The bad news is that they‚Äôre already part of a hated minority, and the Coalition of the Ascendant is confident enough to not even wear the mask of civil rights anymore. Someone at Unz crunched the numbers and it looks like something like six-percent of Corporate America‚Äôs hires post George Floyd were white. We need to stop waiting to become a literal minority‚Äîit‚Äôs going to happen much sooner than initially projected‚Äîand start recognizing we‚Äôre already in the minority where it matters most, among those who are going to have to live in this nightmarish future.

            Antiracism is used to attack a society‚Äôs defenses in the same way that the AIDS virus acts to destroy a body‚Äôs immune system. It allows alien parasites to destroy their host without undo interference from the host. In the case of the virus, the host dies not from the virus itself but from any of a variety of infections the body would otherwise be able to cope with. In a society the aliens will not only seek to neutralize the normal response to attacks from other foreigners, but will even organize their invasions and work to shelter and protect them after they arrive. That‚Äôs why conservatives like Mr. Brodow will always be met with hostility from such people when they try to gather support for any beneficial policies. They miss the point of the diversity exercise.
