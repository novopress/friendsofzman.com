        I’m with Z and everyone’s favorite burn-out Chinese engineer in Africa: It’s all so tiresome.
I don’t want to argue with Leftists whites, who are insane, or scheming Jews, who are lying. It’s pointless. They hate me. I hate them. I want them out of my life and out of my lands. That’s the only way. The time has come for a divorce, starting in our own lives and moving outward.

            Amen Brother but could you expand on that last sentence a little bit…The time has come for a divorce, starting in our own lives and moving outward.Most people would never let their neighbors know what they thought or said online so how do you expand outward when that is the norm for our side…

                It’s tough. But over the years, I’ve let my neighbors generally know my politics – in a gentle way. I’ve said for years that I want zero immigration. Not illegal, all immigration.They know that I would never live in a black neighborhood not only because of the crime but because I like being around my own people. I’ve said that I can’t watch TV shows because every commercial is a stupid white guy or a black/white or more ridiculous a black/Asian couple.Now, I’ve never publicly said that blacks are dumber than whites or more prone to violence, but I’ve let it be understood.I’ve been called racist many times. Only once did a neighbor’s wife stick up for me. That said, no one has cut off ties. After awhile, it dies down. There’s occasional joke about me wishing I lived in Germany, but it usually nothing.This weekend, I was golfing with a guy that I kind of knew but not well, and I joked (though not exactly and he knew it) that my clients know that I’m somewhat to the right of Hitler and don’t care. The guy just laughed.Now, that said, I haven’t anyone come to my side, so to speak. But I will say that they cancel culture stuff is much less than before.

                    Thanks Brother but I’m sure your neighbors would not hesitate to throw you under the bus if it meant keeping their own comforts which is why we need our own country so we can be around our own kind in body, spirit, and mind…

                        My teenage daughter stole my Lagos Trading Company t-shirt and wears it around. I told her that it might be dangerous. I also told her that if some middle-age guy stares at her when she’s wearing it, it’s not because he’s creepy but because he’s trying to believe what he’s seeing.

                                He does have a great radio voice, but, no, she just liked the t-shirt. However, she has a good Cliff Notes understanding of my political beliefs. She’s slowly coming around. She’s naturally more dissident that I am, but she’s young so it takes time.
Let’s just say that she’s not happy that her high school has seen an influx of migrant kids lately.

                    They know that I would never live in a black neighborhood not only because of the crime but because I like being around my own people.
They totally understand it because it also is how they choose to live. Whether they admit it to themselves, let alone to others, is a whole different ball game.

                    Citizen, best of luck with your kids. Some kids can bond strongly enough with their parents that they can stay devoted to their parents who engage in wrongthink.
My niece grew up in one of the most liberal cities in the country, but she still loves her Trump-supporting daddy, my brother, in spite of the maelstrom of media that tells her to hate him.
But his son hates him because my brother gently but firmly made him do his homework, which is unforgivable.
Sadly, I’m sure there are many devoted parents who lost their kids this way. Good luck, friends.

I remember sometime in my early teens realizing that the media was more powerful than my parents and siding with the media.  My parents may hate my long hair, but I believed that I would receive greater praise from the media-culture.  It took me 20+ years to realize that I mostly agreed with my parents.
On your recommendation, I’ll look for contrary signs.  I’d like to be wrong.

                                I don’t think the human mind is well equipped to deal with these “virtual people” who exist in everyone’s minds because of mass media. A good question to ask anyone who is siding with the mass media over their own family is “would these media people give you a place to stay or food to eat?”. Of course the answer is no, they don’t even know most people exist.Until the current age though, there were no virtual people, only real ones. If you agreed with someone and disagreed with someone else, it was reasonable to assume that the person you agreed with would take your side in an argument (or fight if it came to that). This is really the power and the danger of mass media. Media personalities can advocate for the most insane ideas and know that they will never be called to account for them or be required to help their deluded followers.I always think of an old story I heard that one day a bunch of vagrants showed up at the estate of some shitlib celeb (I think it was Phil Collins) because they were “inspired” by some dumb social justice song he wrote. Of course they were quickly removed by security. Everyone needs to be taught this. None of these people you watch on TV or the internet care anything for you or even know you exist. They’re the closest thing in the real world to the voices of demons that our ancestors warned about.

            I totally get it C… but I don’t think peaceful separation is possible. Jewish grift requires other people’s money – and lots of it. Violent stupid black people will participate with them wholeheartedly in exchange for crumbs. Reduced to their base state, blacks are nothing more than sophisticated predatory killer apes. You may as well try to make peace with with a scorpion or a rattle snake.I hate to say it but I am now completely black pilled. In order to redeem the courts, restore law and order, and achieve any kind of real peace or prosperity, at least 1/3 of the current American population is going to have to be either killed, removed, or so thoroughly beaten into submission that their ability to attack and prey on others is negated. Many of them are whites and I’d guess a majority of them are women.

                    As the white population dwindles, the “others” that are left will care less and less about Black History month and whether Jon’tavious’s feelings are hurt, or how to hire more DEI HR ladies with doctorates.

                                Ostei, there is the process of taking a good ribbing to the point of annoying commentary, which one considers personal.  I’ve taken some in good stride, but am now tiring of it.  I know the difference between serf and surf, as you well know.Perhaps you’d consider in the future adding something of general interest to the discussion at hand, other than pointing out my—and many others’—grammatical/spelling errors via one line quips.  This behavior has since the early days of the Internet been considered poor form.Heretofore, I considered such to be good advice and have avoided such mostly—albeit, I am not entirely perfect in that regard.  As the line from “The Shootist” goes, “…I don’t do these things to other people, and I require the same from them.”

            I have begun to tell lefty that the only solution to our situation is peaceful separation. That is when they have meltdowns and begin sputtering about how we want to destroy the county. I then tell them that if we separate, they can everything they want immediately. They can eliminate carbon, have unlimited immigration, unlimited abortion (even into the fourth trimester) get rid of Christian churches, have mandatory homosexual lessons for all school students, etc…They are dumfounded and really don’t know how to respond. I then continue and tell them that our situation is like a really bad marriage, where the spouses don’t agree on anything and have begun to hate each other. One spouse has gotten 90% of everything she wants and continues to scream that you are a horrible person for not giving her the other 10%. I’ve always told my kids that in their marriages, that if you win 90% of the arguments then their spouse is losing 90% of the arguments and that is not going to work out well long term. The left has shoved so many things down our throats that we find morally and rationally unacceptable that the breaking point has been reached. What did you think would happen? Peaceful separation is really the only answer and any thought that you can put this back together is delusional.

                    Of course, I know they will never let us go peacefully but discussion of violent separation really doesn’t serve my argument with lefty yet. The idea is to plant the idea that we view the society/economy that they have created as crazy and unsustainable and we need to escape from their increasing insanity and eventually the discussion will be option 1, peaceful separation or option 2, violent separation.

                            Again I know that you are right but I can’t help myself. It’s actually enjoyable to watch them beginning to realize that the whole thing is starting to unravel. The housing affordability crisis in Canada, driven largely by the left’s political program of racing to replace out heritage population, has really started to wake some of them up. Watching your cities starting to resemble the mysterious subcontinent of India is having an effect even on the most obsequious liberal. I am under no illusions what will eventually be necessary but that time has not arrived yet. It will take an economic collapse as a catalyst.

                            It seems to me that separation need not be all or nothing. I mean in the sense that we still have freedoms of association in certain domains. E.g. if you attend a church, it’s unlikely you have vocal atheists in the congregation demanding equal time. I like Vaari’s tactic also, telling Lefty that there are two worldviews that are fundamentally irreconcilable. The best option would seem separation. It will come peaceably or “other” In extremis, nothing will save us from the boxcar. But the Vaari method has the advantage of telling others in relatively diplomatic, yet in no uncertain terms, where one stands.

                    That was the case in the War of Northern Agression and the European civil wars a few centuries before that but it didn’t happen that way at the fall of Rome. The old Regime was too weak and stupid to defend itself any longer and the provinces, although they lost what things Rome could still guarantee like trade, were happier without the Roman oppression. The future of that land was to be in provences so strong they were literal  states, like Venice. To this day there is a far greater difference in peoples between provinces in Italy than there is today between Americans in Texas and New York. That needs to change. The Framers did not cobble together this arrangement of government so that we could be alike but rather that we would be free to be unalike without war. It’s a Republic, if you can keep it.Violence, maybe, but not inevitably. Collapse of the ruling economic system leaves the door open for great change, for the worse and for the better. But no, no one and nothing can reform the system, because it is the system by its nature that will reform them.It is not until bankruptcy that people are torn the opinions that they held close for years, and become open for persuasion and change.

yea.  The key is to hate them back with all of your might.  Do nothing to help them.  Ever.  Make things as hard for them as you possibly can.  Don’t even hold the door for them at the grocery store.  Fuck them.

        I don’t blame pitbulls for attacking people; they are only being true to their well-known nature. The people I despise are the owners who insist on having such pets. ‘He’s a good boy really’ until the second when he isn’t.Similarly, the greater propensity of Blacks to commit crime is an established fact. I don’t feel bitter about that. It’s just a brute fact. It is bourgeois white progs, who have adopted them as pets from a safe distance, who are the greatest enemies. The psychopathy, malice and perversion of the white leftist are all far more deadly because they have the power and wealth to use their selected attack dogs to best, or worst, effect.

            Exactly. White women essentially are the owners in this case (“masters,” really, although they avoid the term). I will reup again that the main problem in the United States is Puritans, not the Tribe and not the more blatant savages. It has been the same people and same mentality that has been the source of misery since before the Founding. Take out the Puritans and all the other problems go away. Unfortunately, with the advent of Empire Puritanism was weaponized and exported to most of the world, so others abroad either will deal with their problem or suffer as we do.

                Concur on the strange twist of the Puritan mind and its expression in the Anglo Empire’s history of shenanigans.
Whites imagining they are conquest jews, from a Book where jews imagined they were conquest whites, will do that to ya.
JudeoPuritan fits most especially in the context of the influence of the Rothschild City of London and subsequent British maneuvers.
A subset of whites has become as or more dangerous to the future of the white race as any competitor.  Our deadliest competition is our own.

Didn’t the British kick out  the Puritans? Not many English or Puritans in Starmer’s government. You could try looking at the Scottish political scene if you want to feel better about your own country’s imminent demise.

            The only difference between you and the shitlib gun grabbers are the lies you choose to believe and the vacuum between your ears. Shut up already – you’re not worth listening to.For the rest of us: Take all the fatal pit bull attacks and do your due diligence. You will find the majority of the dogs will show signs of abuse. They will have owners, typically 18-25 years old with criminal records and dealings with the police. In America – coincidentally enough, the majority of those owners are black. Typically, when their pit bulls are confiscated and/or destroyed – they go out and get Rotties or Dobermans or Cane Corso dogs.

                    I get the sarcasm, but what you say is correct.  I live in an Hispanic town.  This means Pit Bulls and Chihuahuas are the norm.  Yet at the County “no kill shelter”, they allow some of the pit Bulls to run around the cages unattended.  Damn sweet dogs—and it gets them adopted.  (Aside:  Things are so bad economically here that the dogs repeatedly have explanations of why they were turned in to the effect, “it eats too much”.  Indeed, the shelter is now giving dog food to those people which is cheaper than housing the dog.  Old people especially—since they share their “people food” with their one companion in the world, a damn dog!  Gawd, I hate this society…)On the other hand, we have as a family raised Ridgebacks who—if they get within two feet of you—are considered extremely “affectionate”.  Each to their own I guess.

                        Pit Bulls are a mixed bag, genetically.  Watch the Westminster Dog Show and they have a bunch of them of different varieties.  The common ones we see are even a mixture of those.  We talk past each other trying to describe the problem.  At that point it’s better described as a function of owner, rather than breed.Hell, years ago I was on the golf course with the Ridgebacks and a couple ran out of their home and brought out their Weimaraner.Hunting dog.The couple said they were trying to “socialize” their new dog.Everyone got along famously, being all field dogs.  They all ran and ran and chased each other as dogs do at the dog park.  I said good luck, I’ll see you around and continued on my way.Well, a few months later I meet them again by their home and asked about their new dog, forget the name.  There was a brief pause and they said they put it down.  Turns out the dog attacked a small child and that was that.  Now this is a damn Weimaraner!  Who’d have thought?None-the-less, when our grandchildren came by after we got the current Ridgeback, no chances were taken.  However, their parents were less than cooperative so the dog got a taste of toddler play—ear pulling, slapping, and whatnot.  Damn dog simply ran away and hid.

                    I live in Southwest Florida and am a lifelong outdoorsman. Wild hogs infest every patch of woods around here and hunting them with dogs is a big thing. Some of my friends participate in this sport. They have hounds that do the tracking, chasing, and bringing the hog to bay. Then their other dogs move in and grab the hog and hold it until the men finally come crashing through the palmettos to “hog-tie” the critter. These “catch dogs” are invariably pit bulls and/or corsos. It’s been my experience that these “catch dogs” are just as friendly to any and all humans as any other pooch. Their vicious bites are reserved for squealing wild pigs.That being said, I don’t think these particular breeds should be allowed to be owned by city folks who have no intention of hunting wild hogs.

                I will say, I had a roommate years ago who had a pit bull he bought from a black entrepreneur, so the dog might’ve been from a fighting line, who knows. Sweetest dog ever, at any rate. I figure that innate sweetness turns to viciousness if betrayed, although there’s no accounting for bad breeding.

            Yes, I am waiting for the sci-fi novel of the 21st century in which the new resurrection technology permits cloning the dead and reconstruction of their minds.  Every decade or so the really heinous criminals will be resurrected and publicly executed, forever.  LBJ, teddy kennedy, emanuel celler, would certainly all be candidates for such honors.

        This is why I don’t want to see Pres. Trump ‘fix’ anything but deportation.I don’t want to see him propping up the US dollar (the life blood of the evil empire) or rebuilding the US military so that it can more effectively serve the [City of London-New York City-Tel Aviv] Axis of Evil on modern battlefields.Even if we deport every single illegal alien, not just the most recent raiding party, it’s not good enough any more. We need a new ruling class.Complete civilizational collapse is the cure. Either we will rise from it and completely and pitilessly destroy those attempting our genocide or we will pass from existence, a failed slave-of-Jew life-form too nice and too stupid to endure. Deportations are just preconditioning the battlefield by depriving Satan’s minions of cannon fodder.

            Horace:  Very well said.  And I am in full agreement that I don’t want anyone trying to ‘fix’ anything.  Every institution, every aspect of society and culture, is rotten to the core.  Fiddling around with minor limitations on the franchise or reforming the state security apparatus is like the ‘war on poverty.’  Billions of dollars and decades wasted in trying to engineer a ‘fix’ to genetic nature while simultaneously denying its existence.I’ve been called a black piller, but I prefer hard-eyedrealist.  I take great joy in life from my beloved family, and the many blessings of White civilization (electricity and indoor plumbing, literature, music, art, etc.).  But I also know that many prior civilizations and peoples have vanished in the mists of time.  White Europeans are not immune.My husband was grumbling the other day about something online again falsely calling the ancient Egyptians black, and attributing writing and many other things to black Africans.  But these are the people writing and editing the books, teaching in the schools, and restocking the libraries.  Everyone likes to mock the inane ignorance of the average murkan, but in 15 years (assuming AINO lasts that long, and I don’t) all the books telling the truth will be gone.  They’re being sold off and shredded as fast as the librarians can manage.I am not exaggerating in the least when I say White people, culture, and history is being erased.  Between the Jews and blacks claiming it all (and the IQ cultists attributing it all to China), I truly believe White accomplishments and their history will vanish in my lifetime.  Add in the attack on and erasure of sexual differences and the dying family, plus aggressive anti-White hate and miscegenation propaganda, and Whites may well drop from 10% of the world’s population to 3% – and it won’t take even 50 years.As you so prophetically wrote, either we collapse the abomination that is AINO and rebuild, or we pass from existence.  We are truly at an inflection point in history – so, blackpill or not, I will continue to call out every danger.  Filipinos may not yet have taken over Poland and Hungary, but AINO started out with ‘just a few’ imported non-White workers as well (blacks are another story entirely).  All it takes is one, and one is too many.

                One black pill “deserves” a white pill.Reminds me of Fahrenheit 451, written by Ray Bradbury and published in 1953–is a dystopian novel set in a future where books are banned, and “firemen” burn any that are found. In the end, the protagonist steals a book and memorizes it and joins an underground society which preserves such knowledge. One book, one dissident at a time.How much easier today when a dozen flash drives can hold in digital form all the works in the Library of Congress? The point being, knowledge can never be destroyed. Even in the medieval times, it was preserved according to the abilities of those times.

                    Compsci:  Yes, I read Fahrenheit 451 in middle school.  And it is a white pill on its face.  But as people die and generations change, so too do values.  Pastors like to say that Christianity is one generation from extinction – and we’re seeing that in real time in the US and Europe (no, I do not count African animist/voodoo Christianity as the same faith).  What one man may consider a timeless book to memorize or save, his son/grandson may consider heretical thought and/or a bounty if turned in to authorities.And yes, knowledge can be destroyed.  We no longer know how to build reliable space ships.  We never recovered the exactRoman ingredients for concrete.  There are many classical treatises lost to time.  A flash drive is great . . . as long as you have a working computer and stable electricity.

                        Then you missed the point of Fahrenheit 451.  The point was that society *had* voted to eliminate books.  That’s what “fireman” did—find illicit books (all books) and destroy them.The book was about dissidents who rejected that society and the elimination of books.  Even more, it was about dissidents *replenishing* themselves as exemplified by Montag, who grew up in that “bookless” society, but never the less came to reject that society’s “anti book” values and other mindless pursuits like flat screen TV’s the size of entire walls and “church” services featuring computer animated talks from Jesus.If on the other hand, if what you say is true, then we should not worry about books as there is no point to them as those folk simply do not exist that care.  Just like humans did not care about the written word before such was invented.  I say that won’t happen.

                What is “AINO” if not the consummate conservatard complaint? The pozzed write it approvingly when they retain blind faith in A, a lifelongpolluter of mindsand a useful cannibalizer of nations.Since A was conceived in rottenness by the rotten for the rotten—like abastardchild ofan unholy Seat, A can’t have a good form. The differences between now and a quarter millenium ago are a matter of degree, not kind. So let “AINO” fall into the landfill of history where it belongs with the reputations ofRobert Morris, Geo. Washington, and Haym Solomon(left to right).Read the inscription on the plinth. It’s a reminder that Washington was a founding “civil rights” activist/hypocrite/termite.

        I’ve nothing to add to what you’ve written except to say that I completely agree with you on every point. In general one just can’t depend on the authorities for justice or retribution. I’m convinced that what the Corleone family did in Long Island is the right thing (and I’m not joking):“It was typical of the young Santino, before he became older and crueler, thathe extended his protection to the community he lived in. Sonny paid apersonal call to the home-improvement firm owner and told him not to sendany of his men into the Long Beach area ever again. As soon as theCorleone Family set up their usual business liaison with the local policeforce they were informed of all such complaints and all crimes byprofessional criminals. In less than a year Long Beach became the mostcrime-free town of its size in the United States. Professional stickup artistsand strong-arms received one warning not to ply their trade in the town.They were allowed one offense. When they committed a second theysimply disappeared. The flimflam home-improvement gyp artists, the door-to-door con men were politely warned that they were not welcome in Long Beach. Those confident con men who disregarded the warning were beatenwithin an inch of their lives. Resident young punks who had no respect forlaw and proper authority were advised in the most fatherly fashion to runaway from home. Long Beach became a model city.”

                It’s been a long, long time since that was the norm in America. They were willing to join a posse or a vigilance committee if the sheriff was too woke to do his job, but as soon as the threat was eliminated, it was “good fences make good neighbors” and “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”
Individualism is not the enemy here. Never was.

            Tangentially, white vigilante justice in the old South kept the nuggras in check, and made Southern society pleasant and functional. Once so-called “civil rights” supervened, the South went straight to hell.

                From a purely utilitarian perspective, all the injustices committed against blacks by whites pre-1960 pale in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of rapes, armed robberies, assaults, carjackings, and murders blacks have perpetrated against whites in the past sixty years since (ahem) “civil rights.”They have destroyed every single city in America where they are concentrated. Everywhere you find large numbers of blacks you find dysfunction, sociopathology and dependence on government for medicine, legal help, housing, food, etc.The sheer cost of dealing with ONE negro accused of committing a violent crime is staggering — police, corrections, court-appointed lawyers and psychologists, judges, parole, lifetime incarceration and food and medical care, care for his bastard spawn while he is in prison… add it up, it’s breathtaking.Segregation was a humane and decent policy for all parties involved — far better than turning feral Negroes loose to rape 80-year old white widows and then spending millions of taxpayer dollars incarcerating them.

            River Forest, longtime bedroom community for the Chicago mob and heavily Italian then, was the same.  While Tony Accardo and his family were vacationing in Palm Spings  late in 1977 their home in River Forest was burgled.  A few months later all five men thought to be involved in any way with the burglary turned up dead.  No arrests, no one was charged.  Safest town in Illinois.

            Yes. It is happening now, actually, with falsified/misleading data. I’m shocked the racial aspects still are published at all. Some time back the propaganda organs stopped mentioning that a perp was black. It has now spread to BOLO’s and other suspect descriptions.

                It was always stupid and wrong to believe the numbers coming from the cops, as any city dweller who’s evertriedto report a crime knows. Now that they openly lie and brag that they’re lying, “the right”—libertarians and nooooticers—areeven moreattached to their numbers.Nerds don’t care if numbers are fake. They bow to anyone who supplies them.Libertarians:Crime is down! Always! Progress! Everything is progress! Menaced by migrant crime? First of all, that doesn’t exist. Second, maybe try not being the kind of loooooooozzzzzer we’re replacing. MAGATS BTFOAnyone who’s seen a most wanted list knows that the police label every criminal white who’s not a full-on blue bantu. Crime stats aresystematically falsifiedto impugn white men—and still the numbers make blacks, hispanics, and arabs look like they’re on a 24/7 zoo escape rampage. But did you noooootice, they stopped wearing seatbelts in 2020? Re-fund Officer Friendly!Total nerd death.

                In some cases (all, perhaps?) there is no legal requirement for local governments to report crime statistics to the FBI or whomever. Even what data are reported are probably not vetted for accuracy. And of course the usual suspect is politics. In nearly any local area with even the national average share of blacks (about 13%), it’s a given that the blacks will commit most of the serious crime. In cities like Washington D.C. (about 40%) they commit substantially all the murders and other violent crime. These are known facts. But it’s considered taboo to discuss them. Put yourself in the shoes of a peon tasked to report crimes to a database. You may not actually believe in the woke idiocy, but you probably do have a care for your career prospects. That will heavily influence what you report, or indeed, if you report at all.

                Exactly. A whole lot of us, realist dissident guys, would have to die to rectify the situation. It’s called having an army and the key words are self sacrifice.

                    Don’t know if you saw this when I posted it to 3g on an earlier article but it fits with what you stated about the dissident guys in general…It’s something Solzhenitsyn wrote…the uprising went unresisted, to a man – even as those men and soldiers saw what was coming. And yet they did not respond accordingly. Terror has that effect. By the time it’s felt, it’s too late…Every man always has handy a dozen glib little reasons why he is right not to sacrifice himself.Guys won’t even move, organize, better their situation so how can you expect them to fight…Like when has our army ever just grabbed someone off the street and sent them into combat without any training or cohesion…We are seeing the effects of what happens when an army does that in Ukraine and it’s not good…Some of those videos are quite gut wrenching when you think that could very well be someone close to you at some point in the future right here at home…

            Boomers, like the rest of us have been subjected to nonstop propaganda their entire lives.  They grew up with a Jew in their living room (TV), another one in their bedroom and in the car (radio).  Don’t forget about printed material like newspapers and magazines and digital material like websites.  Every means of mass communications is used for and has been used for propaganda for many decades.  It’s a miracle that anyone can think clearly on any subject at all.

        When I heard the man’s name I thought of Pulp fiction. Anyway, I think there is something about out of control bureaucracy that kills efficiency and eventually effectiveness. Back in the day, say the 1930s New York, you killed in big apple, it took the empire state a year, maybe a year and a half, to fry you in sing sing. Endless appeals about this and that is a much much later thing. The reason it takes a quarter of a century to execute a murderer is the same reason it takes a quarter of a century to build a bridge or railway somewhere. Bureaucracy is about NOT making decisions while shuffling whole forests worth of paper around.

                                Superb. It is the prosecutors who are completely out of control. I say all officers of the law- the judge, prosecution, defense- all should be liable.
Instead, we make bar owners and ‘negligent’ parents liable, or especially parents who resist Woke madness.

        I’ve come to believe that one very under-appreciated positive to the death penalty is that it prevents murderers from killing again.  It’s become pretty clear to me that a “life” sentence nearly never ever means actual life in prison.  I’m kind of addicted to watching true crime docs on YouTube and I remain astonished at how often the same story repeats.  Someone viciously murders one or several people in cold blood.  They’re given a “life” sentence (or have a death sentence commuted) and they’re inevitably released after 5 or 10 years and immediately return to killing.  I saw one of these stories just the other day:https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/sunderland-murder-torture-car-fire-inquest-stephen-unwin-william-mcfall-quyen-ngoc-nguyen-a8934081.htmlNot one but two career criminals savagely murder elderly neighbors in unrelated home invasions and are given “life” sentences.  They’re both out in 10 years and immediately torture, rape and murder a woman just to get her bank PIN.It makes me think that maybe there’s still some benefit to sentencing murderers to death even if the execution never really takes places.  At leastMarcellus Williams was kept behind bars while the shysters tried to overturn his conviction.  Had he been sentenced to just “life”, he probably would be back in jail for his second and/or third murder at this point instead of spending his last however many years marking time on death row.

        Another indicator that capital punishment is doomed is the secret, sterile methods now in use to do the deed, whether the condemned man (it is almost always a man) is black or white.Old Sparky, a/k/a Little Hot Squat, was meant to be more humane than the rope, or the axe, and that was more than a century ago. But it required a fixed location and technology making a crowd of more than a dozen or so infeasible.The whole point of execution (I agree that it is the appropriate and healthy vengeance of an offended society) is demonstrative, because the preventative function can be achieved by incarceration. For centuries, culminating in the 19th, doing it in public, swiftly, finally, and in many cases with effusion of blood was accepted as the purpose of doing it at all.The execution of the defeated Germans were done in public in the East. But at Nuremberg, the condemned men were hanged behind a curtain.Now, people with special skills acquired for the preservation of life do it in a place resembling a trauma bay or ICU room, and the demonstration, to the extent that it is shown at all, is that lifesaving tools and skills can kill also.If society has changed to the point that execution is acceptable only under those circumstances, it should probably be abolished. When “behold the head of a traitor” is replaced by “close the curtain and 10 cc in the brachial vein”, the main, civilizational purpose of the killing has long been lost.

            I generally (but not 100%) oppose the idea of the government killing people to make a point. Sure, it sounds good to all the “conservative” law-and-order types to “hang ’em high,” but we tend to forget what happens when the left-wing nutjobs are in power… you get the Reign of Terror in 1793.
The object should be to remove the threat from society. If death is the only way to do it, so be it. If other means are effective… use them.

                    Chile, mid-1970s? Just had this discussion with a buddy the other day. Yes, part of me says it was kinda cool to throw the left-wing commie bastards out of helicopters. Part of me admires Uncle Augusto.On the other hand… in that kind of situation you’re either in the party and/or the military, or you’re not. And if you’re not, you’re automatically suspect. If the goon squads mistakenly tag you as one of the commie fags  you’re gonna have a hell of a time convincing them otherwise, and if you get shot or tossed out of a Huey they aren’t going to lose a lot of sleep about due process and shit like that.

        The highest principle of the GAE is the inviolable right of blacks to rape and murder whites. To primary purpose of gun control, to cite one policy example, is to prevent a white man from shooting a sacralized being who is wanting to sodomize and then hack to death his kids. George Floyd’s birthday will replace President’s Day at some point. It would have happened already if he had murdered white people prior to his overdose. Haitians are our strength.

        This post gets my blood up.  The State killing an innocent man?  They do it all the time, and folks are OK with it.  If people really thought that was so bad, then they wouldn’t allow the police to carry guns.  Does the name Ashli Babbitt ring a bell. Or Vikki Weaver?
Then there is that old line “Better ten guilty men go free than one innocent man die”.  Cute.
In the real world that works out to “Better ten guilty men go free to kill ten more innocent men than one highly questionably innocent man die.”

            I would much rather live in a society where I was at a  minuscule risk of being mistakenly executed, than our current risk of being murdered for my tennis shoes.
I think a major cause of our distorted, perverted, society is a kind of “Stockholm syndrome” afflicting our urban populace- They grew up being helplessly bullied by (D)irtbag constituents such as bl**ks, teachers, gays, govt workers – in order to tolerate that treatment they believe things that make them feel OK about it, like: “can’t fight back, that’d be racist” …

        This is why the US needs an market crash of epic proportions. Only suffering in the form of poverty is going to snap people out of their delusions and narratives. Just watch, the moment the markets crash 90% is the moment all this woke nonsense dies out.
Woke is a luxury belief and people can only afford luxuries when economic times are good.

        The remedy to this problem is as ancient as evolution. A relatively small cohort of our population has corrupted our culture and societal institutions to the detriment of all. Today’s post is but another example of this. As such, we must evolve methods of remedy that transcend conventional mechanisms because the game is rigged against sanity. Those are the wages of using our civility against us. The bolt-from-the-blue works, and we should strive to become good at it. They want to change society, but this change can anything, even that which works.

But I m not keen on firing up the death penalty train because it will be controlled by our enemies. They hold the state power for the time being. Let’s not give them a deadlier tool

Currently, the death penalty is nothing but a joke.  One of these days, deserved summary executions will be made great again…

            Well, if we devolve into a Weimar Republic after a catastrophic economic/societal meltdown, we will indeed have summary executions.  Count on it.

What that tells us is us whites have to start thinking about how to separate from the other races; and what that tells us is that we have to convince more and more whites that while race mixing and equality may have had good intentions, it’s been tried and found horrible for whites.

        “Justice” in America is defined by the verdict and sentencing of the perp by a jury of his/her peers. Anything after that just gets in the way.

There will come a point soon that words run out, verbal communication is no longer possible, neither side can hear the other or even care to. And then we will have civil war.Only actions can resolve this quagmire. Not words.Watch. We may first see a massive market crash. That will bring in reality like a tsunami.Then the fighting will start as people realize partytime is over and scavenging time for limited resources has begun.

            “peaceful separation”
Anyone who uses this phrase deserves the hell we all have to live in.
It is not a solution, because they won’t let you go peacefully.  They will use violence to keep you a slave.

                Yes – this is undeniable.  Americans would do well to really study the Spanish Civil War.  That way it will be clear just what that shitlib neighbor down the street will do if given the chance.  They’re not just harmless nuts.  In his/her heart, each is a murderous zealot.  They would bash little children or old people to death with clubs given the license to do so.The Last Crusade is a good book for this topic, but any fair history written by a non-Leftist should give an adequate flavor of what went on.  I think it’s relevant to the subject article, in that Franco’s refusal to be maximally vengeful against the communists prevented the deep cultural improvement Spain needed to resist Leftist ideology after his death.

        “The usual suspects swept in once he was convicted to trick people into questioning their own minds, in an effort to free another black killer from the justice he deserves.”It’s even worse than that.  It is at its essence a case against *all* justice/penalties required by society.  A form ofnihilismif you will.  These folk who are against the “death penalty” are against *all* penalties for anti-social, criminal behavior.If you’ve listened in depth to these advocates against the death penalty, you discover that the typical argument which follows the “how do we know they are guilty” sophism is the argument that these murderers “are no longer the same person that they once were”.  In short, the punishment no longer is appropriate after 20-25 years on death row.This new sophism is currently used for those criminals who avoided the death penalty by receiving a “life without parole” sentence.  It has worked.  Youthful offenders are now fairly automatically spared the death penalty on a regular basis using this false assumption and any number of “lifers” have had their life sentences commuted by politically rapacious governors seeking the Black vote.When the death penalty is finally abolished, and that is only a matter of time, then you’ll see these people switch to “early release” arguments for all violent prisoners—after all they are not the same person that committed the crime 5, 10, 20 years ago.   🙁As we saw in the 60’s and 70’s with mental asylum patients, we will see a “new” prison system evolve of revolving doors via short sentences and increasing violence on the population—White and Black!It has been said that a “smart person” learns from the mistakes of others, that goes for success as well.  In that case I’d guess, we will learn *nothing* from El Salvador’s crack down of criminal gangs, which has produced in “one fell swoop”, a country now touting some of the lowest crime rates in South America.Sigh….

            To be fair, the death penalty is a 2 prong test.  One is guilt, the other is for qualification for the death penalty.I think we need guilt to be a 2 prong test.  First is conviction, second being certainty in that conviction.Not all guilty verdicts are equally certain.  There is no difference between a conviction based on eye witnesses who knew the suspect beforehand (completely eliminating false identification) along with video tape of the murder and a ton of physical evidence and one based entirely on circumstantial evidence. Guilty is guilty. It is a binary proposition.Though I agree false capital convictions are probably rare, presumably they do happen.How this could be implemented justly is a mystery to me.  Any review board for certainty of guilt could easily be infiltrated by people opposed to the death penalty or  jails in general. We could put it in the hands of the jury.  It could also ease the conscious of a juror who believes the guy is guilty, but not so strongly they are willing to send the guy to the chair and therefor left with only not-guilty as an alternative.Even though I recognize this problem, I still strongly believe in the death penalty.Also, we absolutely have to reduce the amount of time between conviction and death.  Kevin Cooper has been sitting on death row since 1984.  The problem is the victims’ relatives die or move away and 100 other problems, but SJWs never sleep.  Long after the prosecutor and detectives are retired and the victims’ relatives die or move away, SJW lawyers and their buddies in the media get to work trying to get them released.  Look at what happened with Adnan Syed. That POS was released from prison without even notifying the victim’s family.  Right now, this murderer is teaching about false convictions at a university!!  Though his luck may have run out. The murder conviction has been reinstated, but he’s still out for now.

                I think you may be incorrect here.  Those with experience can elaborate.  Guilt upon conviction is considered “certain” in our legal system.  Any appeal is to the process involved *only*.  Yes, even additional evidence is part of process.  Review boards don’t play into this as I see it.The award of penalty is (somewhat) in the purview of the judge (obviously as in legal code as voted by legislature) and there are often outlined directly in the listing/balancing of aggravating and extenuating circumstances.  That also can be considered somewhat subjective as it is under decision by an appointed judge.In any event, if the system is considered flawed wrt the “death penalty”. Then the system is flawed wrt all penalties/crimes, and in such “justice” does not exist.  This is sophistry.

                    I think you may be incorrect here. Those with experience can elaborate. Guilt upon conviction is considered “certain” in our legal systemI fully agree. I just oppose this, at least a little.What I meant is we should take into consideration the level of confidence we can have in a conviction, and not just what crimes they are charged with.There are cases that are open and shut. Where we, as the public can have a 100% certainty that they got the right guy. Where the evidence is so overwhelming that it proves beyond the shadow of a doubt, as opposed to above a “reasonable” doubt.I also agree with you that most opposition to the death penalty is sophistry and BS put forward by people who oppose it on some unrelated (to the case) grounds. I do not oppose capital punishment generally, I just think we should be at or very near to perfect certainty and once that determination is made, a very fast execution. Unfortunately, most cases that are that strong usually involve a plea deal which takes the death penalty off the table. We need to take these plea deals off the table too.Imagine Derrick Chauvin was facing the death penalty. Imagine Travis &amp; Gregory McMichael were on death row right now. Having an appointed judge didn’t help. Having the right law didn’t help. Granted, they are not facing the death penalty, but the cases do prove false convictions do happen.I disagree this is sophistry.  False convictions can be overturned if the guy is still alive.  Steven Avery spent 18 years in prison for a crime we absolutely know for certain he did not commit. He was a lowlife who was headed to prison anyway, but we know he did not commit that rape.  If she had also been killed (death penalty case) and it still took 18 years to figure out he didn’t do it, he’d have been dead by then.

                        “What I meant is we should take into consideration the level of confidence we can have in a conviction, and not just what crimes they are charged with.”I think I know where you are coming from, but in our “system” the jury decides upon the facts and the judge instructs in the law.  Of course, you and I decry daily quality of the average American to make sound and thoughtful decisions, so what I say means little.The above however does not preclude a change of system.  For example many countries have no jury, but rather a tribunal of judges—you know, folks trained in the law and more importantly have seen numerous cases upon which to sharpen their insight into the human condition.Heck, in Korea—as near as I can tell—they have a blend.  The jury empaneled advises the Chief Judge of the tribunal and he is not bound to pay the slightest attention to it.  He thanks them and dismisses them and then talks it over with the two other judges and and *he* (or she) pronounces guilt/innocence and the sentence.

            We seem to have any number of posts promoting torturous deaths for conviction.  Really, that’s old thinking (IMHO).  That went out with the Middle Ages and is somewhat what still holds us (death penalty advocates) today.  Let the government be as efficient as possible in eliminating the undesirables rather than in extracting vengeance and I’ll be happy.
One thing you might talk me into is sterilizing a convicted criminal’s offspring—but hey, that’s just me.   😉

        Anyone interested in this should look at the case of Kevin Cooper and all the usual suspects trying to free him.
He has had puff pieces written about him in just about every major newspaper.  This fine upstanding man put an axe into the heads of 3 children and 2 adults with one of the children surviving.

        Much of the ennui regarding death penalty inmates stems from the facts that “out of sight, out of mind” incarceration is easy, but also because the vast majority of those on death row are there because they shot other scumbags…people who don’t matter.Still, it’s only a matter of time before a bereaved father, uncle, or brother who’s wife or daughter has been violated by a horrific crime takes matters into his own hands.Gerard Butler had a movie called “Law Abiding Citizen” that explored this. Pretty dark stuff, and frankly, I would’ve ended it differently.(I hasten to add: that would be a societal disaster. Multi-generational blood feuds are the essence of the Middle East..conflict for thousands of years.)

            Looking at the behavior of certain people, including all of our politicians, I am now firmly of the belief that it should be “guilty until proven innocent”.
No doubt that was part of Christianity for a while, with the entire “we’re all sinners’ thing.
Right, everyone is guilty until proven. You’re a politician? I am assuming you’re guilty of corruption until you prove your innocence.

            The word “horrible” doesn’t seem to do justice to that video, but it’ll have to do.  A vivid reminder of the horrors in human form who are out there.  And why some kind of orderly policing is badly needed.
I’m convinced that Ed Dutton is right that we’re now seeing the results of a population which includes all sorts of damaged genetic material, which wouldn’t have survived long in previous times when there was stronger law and order, along with “harsh Darwinian conditions.”

That’s The Conservatard Treehouse for you. They proudly declare slavish faith in Romans 13:1-7 with their prayer candle, with their About page, and in “THE STILL HOUR” near the bottom of every page.
The people need to have low expectations for theindigenous militaristsof (((Western))) civ. Those fake enemies of “hate and division” are enemies of “Truth” and “freedom” everywhere on Earth. They’re no better than thenazis who have a better understandingof European conservatardism than most commenters here.

                They have lines.  That’s fine.  I’ve been happily surprised about how many of their commenters haven’t gone Israel-crazy.  There’s a strident anti-endless-war base in the GOP right now.  Pointing out that Israel is trying to drag us into a war with Iran is fine these days.Especially if pointed out in concert with Trump’s bilateral Abraham Accords.  What’s going on in the M.E. now is just complete insanity, and I think conservatives have sniffed it out (like we did with Libya during the Obama years).  It’s easy to forget, but the GOP House could not get Israel funding passed without Ukraine and Taiwan tied to it.  That was a BFD that a lot of people overlooked.I just bypass the whole “Well guess who the neocons are” thing.  People have figured it out.

        The title of Z Man’s essay today is “The Only Solution,” yet the word “solution” does not appear in the text itself.
My best guess as to what his solution is: “What this tells us is we need to be executing many more black offenders, to not only get the current numbers in proportion to the well-known crime figures on murder, but to address the many years of discrimination against white murderers.”
Is that it?

        Here is another thing to consider.
The costs of a death penalty trial and execution is in the millions of dollars vs hundreds of thousands to keep an inmate locked up for life.
Not only was the original victim murdered, but the lifetime economic productivity of another person was also completely destroyed in rendering justice.
That system can only be maintained provided crime rates remain low.

                Zulu, you are falling for it.  These folks don’t give a hoot in hell for the poor sap on death row.  These folk are nihilists bent on destroying the justice system.  It is they who have made such punishment “cost ineffective” and it is they who—when the death penalty is deemed “cruel and unusual”—will then switch challenging the alternative punishments, such as “life without parole”.
These people will never stop until there is not such thing as an effective justice system.

        “The point of the death penalty is to exact revenge, on behalf of society, on the person who committed the crime.”I don’t look at it that way. I look at it more like putting down a rabid Pitbull. It’s simply a being that is of no use to society and a menace to people just minding their own business.However, and my niece worked on the Innocence Project, there have been too many mistakes made along the way.3,175+Exonerations since 1989 in theNational Registry of Exonerations;375People exonerated through DNA evidence since 1989; 27,200+Years exonerated people spent in prison for crimes they did not commit.That may not sound like much in the whole scheme of things, but if you’re the guy on death row and you didn’t do the crime, it’s a lot.https://eji.org/issues/wrongful-convictions/#:~:text=3%2C175%2B,the%20National%20Registry%20of%20Exonerations.

                    Nihilistic argument based upon emotion and an improper understanding of the Innocence Project, which has less to do with innocence than tying the system of justice into knots such that it can no longer function.
But than again this is a comment by Nick, so my comment in redundant.

                        Do you know what an uphill battle an appeal is? Appeals courts are generally not flippant about changing the results of what happened in a trial court. The evidence, or lack thereof, or the lack of following proper procedure must have been pretty overwhelming for a case to be overturned.

                            That’s the way it should be. However in capital cases the verdict is not carried out, which is why the effect is minimal. In all other cases the verdict is some form of imprisonment, so in reality justice *is* being carried out while the case is disputed.

            An interesting cocktail party conversation starter I use: Would you approve humane euthanasia for someone who after having been given 3 chances to rehabilitate themselves and having refused all three or returned to their old habits after 3 attempts to force them to change, knowing that they have cost society much more than they have contributed, and have physically damaged or injured every other person they have had contact with and will continue to do so if not removed? This would refer to chronic alcoholics, wife beaters, child molesters, habitual drug addicts, petty thieves, car thieves, bank robbers, home invaders, rapists, sex traffickers, gun runners, etc.

            Can you re-read and edit your comment?
I believe you had good points to make but they are utterly lost in your typographical errors and incomprehensibly poor writing.
Was the number of people exonerated 3175 or 375?
Does the number 27,200 represent the number of people exonerated or the cumulative number of years persons wrongfully incarcerated spent behind bars?

                    By exonerated, which Nick does not define, he means that the evidence was most often so old that the convicts could not be retried and therefore were either allowed to be freed on time served or cop down to a lessor crime and sentence. He also does not take into account exactly why those convicted were accused in the first place. The assumption one is left with is some poor sap walking home from a good day’s work and being picked up at random. Nothing could be further from the truth.Of course, this in Nick, so that’s to be expected.Here’s some useful info Nick can not be bothered to provide:”Key successes of the Innocence Project:1.	Exonerations: As of 2024, the Innocence Project has helped exonerate over 240 people through DNA testing. Nationwide, over 375 wrongful convictions have been overturned using DNA evidence, with many assisted by the Innocence Project.2.	Time Served: On average, the individuals exonerated by the Innocence Project served 14 years in prison for crimes they did not commit. Many of these cases involved life sentences or individuals on death row.…”Note we are not necessarily talking about death penalty cases per se, nor are many of these DNA “saves” unexpected since the science is not that old.  Again, no advocate for the death penalty—or any other penalty says that the application or adjudication of guilt should not be done to the current standard of the day—as that standard evolves—and standards always evolve.

            Yeah, that is exonerations for all crimes, not death row. Death row is 163 in 50+ years. I looked at a few, those are goofy technicalities that do not actually call into question actual guilt. Ive also seen PCR proceedings. It also does not account for racially-motivated political actions, e.g. the central park 5, who are plainly guilty but are “exonerated” as a political act of racial hostility..

                Death penalty, yes, but there have also been numerous people exonerated for rapes and other such crimes. Imagine spending 30 years of the prime of your life in prison for a rape you didn’t commit. Every right minded person should be outraged.Or are all you guys now on the “a woman would never lie about sexual assault and should always be believed” bandwagon?The biggest outrage recently was the Amiraults in Massachusetts. The authorities, probably a bunch of pedos themselves, coached the kids into telling outrageous stories like being raped with knives. Gerald Amirault was railroaded by the “save the children” crowd. Listen to his interview several years ago on WRKO. Everybody should be outraged by what happened.

                    Hard cases make bad law.  Society, a functioning society, can never make decisions upon outlier cases, but on the typical or average case. Your thinking is nihilistic as there is never certainty in these matters, but for the most part—majority of cases—the appropriate verdict was returned and justice served.  You let emotion lead you and that is the secret to the Leftist ascendency and the demise of this nation.

                        “Society, a functioning society, can never make decisions upon outlier cases”
It has to. What it should not do is make policy based on outliers.
That might have been what you meant, but there is an important distinction. If for no other reason than in a white society, murder itself is an vanishingly rare outlier.

        I’d love a gulag. Somewhere in Alaska. Keep the really bad alive, three hots and a cot. But otherwise hard time. I know of a Texas case where they killed a retarted man. Because of that, I’m not a fan of the death penalty anymore, but the feds need a really bad prison out in the hinterlands that you’re sent to forever. If it’s found you’re innocent, fine, here’s a check and Bob’s your uncle.

Cheaper, too. I’m no fan of life sentences. Too damn expensive. And no more quick deaths. Bring back hanging. The method of hanging should comport with the severity of the crime.

                    Not necessarily. Work camps can turn a profit if done properly.Personally, if some scumbag murdered one of mine, I’d prefer them to have to spend the rest of their miserable lives in pain and anguish, on a chain gang producing marketable goods to pay for their continued existence.

                I am almost as concerned by the thugs who operate these prisons. Managing prisoners who are living under drastic conditions day-to-day must draw psychopaths and eventually even strip them from any semblance of humanity. Yet their kids go to school with your children.

                Yes , execution is far more humane.  That’s why it doesn’t bother me much when executions take such a long time.  The death row inmate are in a living hell in my opinion.  Typically 23 hour a day lock up.    I have never ever understood why people fight so hard to avoid the death penalty knowing that life without parole is their choice.

                    This might *not* be as true as we are lead to believe.  I remember waay back we had a fight here between the prison warden at the State prison where they housed the death row and the Governor about removing TV’s from the cells.  The logic being that without the TV’s and other accoutrements, the prisoners would be too unmanageable and place the guards in danger.  I can attest to a bit of supportive evidence as I personally know of a prisoner who was sentenced to 144 years (child molestation) whose first request of family was for funds to buy a TV!

                It’s the typical argument that the anti-death penalty folks make.  Don’t fall for it.  The anti-death penalty folk clam that life in prison is harsher than the death penalty.  Of course, they can never explain why every one of these murderers fights tooth and nail for a life sentence when the death penalty is on the table.There are few, very few cases, where the death penalty has been accepted by the convicted.  Last case I remember was the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, who carried out the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995.  He was executed shortly after being granted a cessation of appeals by his lawyers—and that took somewhat of a fight and even then he was executed 6 years after conviction.

                Heinlein’s genius was that he just threw you right into the action, no preface or explanation, and let the reader figure it out the same as the characters. ‘Coventry’ is a stirling example, a bit of Papillon and Escape from New York, of Jack London and Snake Pliskin from what few shards I remember.

            “I know of a Texas case where they killed a retarded man.”No you don’t. You just read accounts by the liberal MSM. However, let’s put that aside and use some good old “critical thinking”. That many criminals are of sub-par intellect is not under debate. However, *criminals* of any race or intellectual category, are the minority of the populace. We have the overwhelming majority of people, say on the lower end of the left of the bell curve—10%, who are *not* violent criminals. They seem to be able to coexist within society without hurting others.What we expect of them is not without reason since so many exist. What we punish is violence against others and given that so many of limited intellect apparently have no trouble avoiding this flaw, why is the one that Texas put to death to be an exception? He is not!

            Arent homicidally violent retards one of the best cases for execution as a function of protecting society? They are incapable of reform and self control such that safe release is impossible, and confinement cannot be done humanely to the perp or safely for the guards… Leaving execution (or I suppose lobotomy or chemical coma) as the only workable result?

            What, exactly, qualifies as retarded? The IQ number was long set at 85 but that was for white people. When it became understood that 85 is the average for Afericans the number was dropped accordingly because we must not make distictions.The fact is 75 is very retarded for a white. Noticably, in physical and verbal manifestations, but 90 is not. In Afericans 75 is near average so no retardation shows. One-eigth of Afericans are at 70. So you tell me what is too retarded to execute? Further, I have never known a highly retarded white man to be violent but I think that is not true of Africans.

                Your down votes are all of your own making.  You might look into yourself before calling those who disagree with you, “buffoons”.As to Kagan, she is indeed not of minor intellect judging from her resume.  However, I considered her not of SCOTUS caliber at the time of her nomination by Obama due to her having no judicial record by which to judge her judicial temperament.  In other words, she checked a box as a woman, but not as a prior judge.This admonition would apply to other members of SCOTUS, but I don’t know of any currently serving.  And yes, I know there is no requirement of judicial experience for the SCOTUS.

                    When you downvote a FACTUAL statement because it does not agree with your worldview, that makes you a buffoon. Nino Scalia indeed recommended Kagan for a seat on the court. It was informal and no knowing how much effect it had, but he did have a lot of respect for her.The “wise Latina” is an ignoramus, we all know that. Not sure about the other one, but I’m sure she has decent academic credentials. But Kagan is solid, whether you agree with her or not.The thing I hate most is echo chambers. If someone from the other side is a good actor and presents solid viewpoints from a different perspective, that’s a good thing, is it not?

                                I call BS.  The SCOTUS is particularly admonished/careful to *not* make political recommendations.  Scalia was a man of integrity.  I defy you to present any citation that he or any other SCOTUS seated member involved themselves in Obama’s recommendation or the Senate confirmation process wrt Kagan. It is however noted that prior to the nomination Scalia and Kagan had a professional relationship of what we might term mutual respect—but that is *not* a recommendation for the office and preceded her nomination.You continue to tout (double down) on your “factual” comments—which are anything, but factual—and rudely refer to those calling you out on your assertions as “buffoons”, yet you *never* provide any evidence for your gratuitous assertions.I put it to you, who is the ”buffoon” here?  Those who doubt your unsubstantiated claims, or those who make unsupported claims—and when challenged, never respond to such challenges with supporting evidence?

When I say something I post is factual, it is factual.“… He wasn’t done. Leaning forward, as if to share a confidential thought, he tried again.“Let me put a finer point on it,” the justice said, in a lower, purposeful tone of voice, his eyes fixed on mine. “I hope he sends us Elena Kagan.”I was surprised that a member of the court would so bluntly propose a nominee, and intrigued that it was Kagan, the former Harvard Law School dean who was appointed solicitor general by Obama to represent the government before the Supreme Court. Though she had worked on policy in the Clinton administration and had a reputation for pragmatism, Kagan plainly would be a liberal in the context of the court.Later, I learned that Scalia and Kagan were friends, though I suspect she would have been as surprised as I was at the brazenness of Scalia’s suggestion. …”https://www.cnn.com/2016/02/14/opinions/david-axelrod-surprise-request-from-justice-scalia/index.html

                                        Yep, if true this was an error on Scalia’s part.  However, we have an “he said, she said” situation.  A columnist from a Lib news agency makes himself an unsupported claim of a private “dinner conversation”.  This you believe as factual.  I am skeptical.  But either way, it is rumor, not fact.  It would not even hold up in court being hearsay.

                                            As I told you, I heard Scalia say it himself on one of those interview shows or maybe at one of those lectures you can find on YouTube. I don’t see anything wrong with it. All he is saying is, take a look at this person. That’s the way the world works. But the point still is that he did have respect for her.
