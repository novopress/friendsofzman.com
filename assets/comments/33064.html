        Americans are liars and love lies. I talked to a shit lib I went to high school with and she was shell shocked from the election.Her main problem was mean things trump said like executing Cheney by firing squad. I looked up the quote, read it to her, and she admitted what she had been told was a lie. He didn‚Äôt say Cheney should be executed by firing squad. Instead of being angry that she was lied to, she went on to other things he has supportively said .The dog returns to her vomit, rhe sow returns to her mire

        It‚Äôs one thing to be lied to and ripped off by your own kind but see below, re Kipling:The Stranger within my gate,He may be true or kind,But he does not talk my talk‚ÄîI cannot feel his mind.I see the face and the eyes and the mouth,But not the soul behind.The men of my own stockThey may do ill or well,But they tell the lies I am wonted to,They are used to the lies I tell.And we do not need interpretersWhen we go to buy and sell.The Stranger within my gates,He may be evil or good,But I cannot tell what powers control‚ÄîWhat reasons sway his mood;Nor when the Gods of his far-off landShall repossess his blood.The men of my own stock,Bitter bad they may be,But, at least, they hear the things I hear,And see the things I see;And whatever I think of them and their likesThey think of the likes of me.This was my father‚Äôs beliefAnd this is also mine:Let the corn be all one sheaf‚ÄîAnd the grapes be all one vine,Ere our children‚Äôs teeth are set on edgeBy bitter bread and wine.

        I recall a survey of parents, oh, must have been about 20 years back or so.
They were asked if they would prefer that their children were caught cheating on a test, or smoking.
The parents overwhelmingly preferred cheating to smoking.
I knew right then we were in big trouble.

        Remember this:‚ÄúIt takes two to lie: one to lie and the other to believe it.‚Äù
Nothing except inertia on the part of believers keeps the lie system going. If the world is full of suckers, the world will be full of people who exploit them.

        In Ancient Greece, elections are the mark of oligarchy. What we have, to them, was an oligarchy.  A democracy, by contrast,  such as Athens used sortition to  rotate office holders. They even had a machine, a kleroterion, which  randomly assigned office holders and jurors.
So if you‚Äôre going to attack  ‚Äúour democracy‚Äù, just bear in mind we don‚Äôt have one. We clearly have an oligarchy.

        By now, most Americans are aware that the FBI is seriously corrupt, including all of its senior management. And DoJ is not far behind. Worse still, the power politicians in the GOP are determined to keep it that way at all costs. They couldn‚Äôt care less about our debt disaster, illegal alien invasion, or endless foreign wars; but will pull out all the stops to keep the Deep State in control. How bad does it have to get before there is a tangible push-back? This is why collapse is the cure. When things get bad enough, the antibodies will get busy and the consequences will not be trivial. Sadly, subtraction is the only effective remedy for what ails us.

        The only reason that lying didn‚Äôt work for Harris is that the powers that be decided not to steal the election from Trump like they did in 2020.
The media is mistrusteddue to their pathological lying but they still serve a purpose. The media tells the managerial class what they need to think and say and who and what they need to censor. Maybe the collapse in ratings will outweigh for the rulers the propaganda function. Maybe not.

        Here are a couple literary references to fibbin‚Äô. First, the mandatory Nietzsche quote in case he‚Äôs not been cited yet today (dibs!):‚ÄúI am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because I can no longer believe in you.‚Äù (Beyond Good and Evil, aphorism 183). Note the masterful ambiguity: It‚Äôs unclear whether someone actually deceived him, nor why he no longer believes, whether from having discovered he was lied to, or perhaps simply because he‚Äôs lost faith.‚Äú[Islam‚Äôs Koran is an] unintelligible book which contradicts common sense in every page‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äì from Voltaire‚Äôs introduction to his play Mahamot.I misremember that quote as ‚ÄúEvery page is an affront to common sense.‚Äù (that phrase does not appear in his works). I note that the criticism would be appropriate for a great quantity of other writings as well.

        There is a limit to lies, just as there is a limit to truth. The true path to power is force, patronage, organization, and delivering on all.No amount of lies by Baghdad Bob could keep the American tanks at bay. No amount of lies can stop a Russian missile. They may or may not have launched an ICBM at a Ukranian town, or it may have been a shorter range missile. Either way the outgoing Admin of Obama is trying to start WWIII out of spite. They truly believe in the power of their lies. Pol Pot certainly did, and so did Rev Jim Jones. Eventually the Vietnamese Army comes, or its Revolutionary self-deletion (avoiding the censor).

        Plato‚Äôs dialogues are full of examples of various types of rhetoric and sophistry, that is to say various skills of how to lie.
Here‚Äôs a topical amusing example of a whopper in this case from the of green energy loons. The claim is true enough, that is that alternative energy is so cheap they almost have to give it away, of course there‚Äôs a very big asterisk to that claim which is basically that  this is only true in cases of peak power generation far exceeding demand.

        I blame the Clintons for normalizing lying.  For them a lie was infinitely mutable and could be changed as needed.   The truth is immutable so they avoided it in all circumstances.
It is not a new feature.  McArthur said of FDR:  ‚ÄúThe man who would never tell the truth when a lie could serve him just as well.‚Äù  FDR won three presidential elections.  There ya go.

        ‚ÄúThis fanciful tale gets across the point that lying was highly immoral in Persian society.‚ÄùThis part is silly.  See Herodotus‚Äôs account of Darius the Great‚Äôs ascension to power.  Darius assassinated Cyrus‚Äôs rightful successor, Bardiya, then falsely claimed that he had actually assassinated a Bardiya IMPOSTER, and that the imposter had actually killed the real Bardiya ‚Äì lol.  There‚Äôs a great account of this story in Gore Vidal‚Äôs novel ‚ÄúCreation‚Äù (1981).‚ÄúThe details regarding Darius‚Äôs rise to power is generally acknowledged as forgery and was in reality used as a concealment of his overthrow and murder of Cyrus‚Äôs rightful successor, Bardiya.  To legitimize his rule, Darius had a common origin fabricated between himself and Cyrus by designating Achaemenes as the eponymous founder of their dynasty.[28] In reality, Darius was not from the same house as Cyrus and his forebears, the rulers of Anshan.‚Äùhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Great#Accessionhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_(novel)

        Lying is standard policy in all collapsing empires. Once there is a system in place that dispenses honors, money, and power (and conversely dispenses death, imprisonment and property confiscation to enemies) people are incentivized to go along with it no matter how fucked up it is until it completely collapses, and they lie to protect their own interests.Anyone remember Baghdad Bob? Saddam had total control over Iraq for 25 years and killed scores of his enemies. It made perfect sense to lie right up until the moment the U.S. Marines entered the building.Guys who tell the truth get canned  and defenestrated from employment if they are lucky, and executed if they are not.Even in systems that are not brutal or totalitarian, there is always an incentive to go along with the lies. The Austro-Hungarian, German, Russian and Ottoman empires all collapsed in 1918. Nobody ‚Äî NOBODY ‚Äî on the collected general staffs of those empires thought that going to war only four years prior was a bad idea. They were all military academy men, career officers, men of status, royalty. Among such people go-along-to-get-along is the rule.Look at the commitment to DEI in the Pentagon, for instance. The last major war the U.S. won was in 1945, with a racially-segregated, all male military in which queers were mustered out for ‚Äúconduct unbecoming.‚ÄùDespite a draw in Korea and a loss in Vietnam with black troops, and  a draw in Iraq and a loss in Afghanistan with blacks, women, transgenders and queers, the entire general staff is committed to the idea that blacks, queers and women make the military ‚Äústronger‚Äù and that the problem is too many white men.The only thing that will cut through the lies and the bullshit, whether they be military, economic, racial, legal, or cultural is a total disaster and collapse.

The former paid with Bolshevism, after disgracefully burning in riots and scandals. I recommend the ‚ÄúMyasoyedov Affair‚Äù as a great example of how the culture of lying leads to mass psychosis and paranoia, Stalin didn‚Äôt introduce anything new in that regard.The latter burned in the rematch of the Great War as the majority of Weimar elites decided to became complicit in the ‚Äústab-in-the-back‚Äù lie. Either through complete delusion (Ludendorff), pride (Hindenburgh) or cowardice (Ebert). The infamous Reich‚Äôs Chancellor didn‚Äôt even create the myth, only perpetuated it.The Gulf War is an interesting example in how the lie becomes all-encompassing. Baghdad Bob lied about the American advances while American establishment fabricated the ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù spectacle to scare any potential enemies of the Empire, obscuring the fact that most of the enemy commanders had already been bribed, as customary for the politics in the region. The problems began when the myth gradually blended with reality and is now contested in the (south) East European Plain as mythmakers scramble to prop up the image of  imperial uncontested superiority in the strongholds of information/entertainment industry.

        ‚ÄúAmerica is on the verge of becoming a nation of liars, just as Cyrus described the Greeks.‚ÄùOn the verge?  We passed the verge a long time ago.  I ran into a great example of the lying that goes on in the US just yesterday.  I stopped at BK to pick up some slop and the price went up and the burger is now 1/2 the size than it was a year ago. The fries are even worse, maybe 1/3 of the size.  Nothing on the menu changed other than the price.  Shrinkflation is an example of the rampant lying in our society.One only need to check any news site, newspaper or cable news show to see another example of the endless dishonesty in American society.  Another great example is our telephones.  They are now near useless for businesses we deal with to contact us with spoofing and the endless telephone scams.What we are on the verge of is becoming a 3rd world nation.

            As you said, not on the verge ‚Äì we are there.  Politicians are all liars.  Lawyers.

        America is not Khartoum. Yet.I‚Äôve traveled the world a bit and the lying is worse elsewhere, in both the cloud and dirt realms. What keeps the West relatively honest is a sense of fairness, plus legal recourse. In most other places, it‚Äôs a jungle, and you have little value beyond a human cash machine. When was the last time you bartered for anything in, say, Little Rock? Most of the world is lying, and its universal language is bartering.I‚Äôm mainly talking about Western dirt people, but they don‚Äôt lie like an Arab or a Chinaman dirt person lies. Arabs and Chinamen will lie with complete abandon. Westerners usually exaggerate or misdirect, and if someone gets hurt, they do get the hammer. Though with cloud people getting punished it largely depends on how tied in and what ethnicity you are.

                Yeah I immediately know how jaded a society is by walking into one of their stores. If the store/shop/stand is organized well, and the prices are clearly posted, and the staff is genuinely helpful (NOT ‚ÄúGood price for you my friend!‚Äù kind of helpful) I know that lying is not much of a thing there.I have been driven by plenty of Indian Uber drivers in the USA. Not one of them have tried to rip me off. I‚Äôd say at least 33% of Uber drivers in India have blatantly ripped me off, or tried. The only difference is that Indians in USA are tied to our legal system and we have a much stronger culture of shame, and they have to play along. As long as they‚Äôre the minority.

            Marko is illustrating a crucial fact: Differing cultures have differing values (morals, laws, etc.) What Westerners think is being ‚Äúripped off‚Äù may be business as usual to the other party. Please note that I‚Äôm not trying to make any judgments of right or wrong here. The main point is that what‚Äôs ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù can vary dramatically by country/culture. As a Westerner I appreciate, indeed take for granted that the marked price of an item is what I‚Äôll pay (add in the tax, etc.) But if you expect the same procedure at Omar‚Äôs Rug Emporium especially in Omar‚Äôs home country, it is YOU who are the philistine who lacks understanding of the alien culture.  Yes, it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to do the song and dance and bargain for the item you want. But it‚Äôs Omar‚Äôs world and that‚Äôs how business is done. And yes, it‚Äôs a problem when the Omars set up shop in our homelands, but that‚Äôs a topic for another time.

                I lived in India for 3 years, and I absolutely hated having to bargain for things. But you have to do it, especially for large items.  As a Westerner, I had much more money than the average Indian, and I could easily afford the asking price for that brass pot or embroidered shawl. Why should I stress myself out to knock off $2 on the price of it?  I should be generous and not try to do down people less fortunate than I. But that is a purely Western way of thinking. In India, *not* bargaining causes problems that wouldn‚Äôt even occur to me. If a vendor asks 100 rupees for an item and I just pay that amount without bargaining, far from feeling happy, the vendor is annoyed. He thinks that since I paid 100 rupees so readily, he could have asked 200 and gotten that! Far from appreciating my generosity, he feels in a vague way as if I cheated him! That‚Äôs why you always had to bargain, even for a symbolic reduction in the price. It kept everyone feeling that they‚Äôd held their own and come away with a victory.

        People are always surprised when I tell them that my default setting in nearly all situations is to assume the other person is lying to me.I used to be a teacher for about 10 years, and while I have always had good radar for liars, teaching elevated my skills to Expert level.  The kids lied, the parents lied, the administrators lied.    And you get REALLY good at spotting the lie.  So good that I could make strategic decisions based on the lie that would later prove to have been good choices.  IOW, once you know what the lie is, you can deduce the likely truth, and act based on this.I get fooled sometimes.  Last week, a guy I hired who begged me for a job quit abruptly after about 10 days.  I had checked references on him.  People gave him a moderate thumbs up.  Not a rock star, but I didn‚Äôt need a rock star.  Anyway, he calls me up after work last week and starts the conversation with ‚Äúhey, uh, I‚Äôm probably going to have to buy you dinner, but‚Ä¶‚ÄùThen, not only did he quit, he announced that this was his last day.I was floored.  When I say he begged me for a job, I‚Äôm talking 6 phone calls and multiple emails over 6 weeks.  That was a bit of a red flag, which is why I checked references.  But his old boss recommended him.  Turns out: they were trying to offload him because they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to fire him.  (Another lie)The dude tried giving me a sob story about how he had applied for a different job, and that job had just come through.  So that means he lied to me up front.  Then he sandbags me.I just laid into him.  Called him dishonest, disloyal, and told him not to ever call me or my company again.  He was shocked.  He thought all would be cool.After all, everybody lies.

            It sometimes takes ‚Äútwo‚Äù.  I once had a graduate student working for me who was applying for full-time work in the tech field. The field was hot in those days and in a short time he had an interview and accepted to a CA company upon graduation in a few weeks.  So far so good.However, it seems he continued to apply for positions and shortly decided that he had sold himself short and ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù more money.  So he calls his ‚Äúnew‚Äù employer and tells them he‚Äôs not coming on such and such a date unless he gets so much more salary than agreed upon initially.  I told him he was foolish and the company was not going to hire someone who reneged on his employment agreement.Well, I was wrong.  He actually successfully negotiated a raise before his first day!  No honor among thieves I guess.

                You can‚Äôt cheat an honest man.
They evidently knew they were low-balling. But why not? If someone offers you something for less than you are willing to pay, take it. But the honest man also knows the implications of water seeking its own level.
A scoundrel will insist on the terms of the contract, rather than seeking an amicable resolution.

                I forgot to mention that I bumped the pay band 3% because he asked for a bit higher salary than the previous guy wanted.As a counter to that example one of my other employees called to say he had been offered a job that pays about $35K more than I pay him.  He wanted to know if I could come up.  I was nice about it, but I won‚Äôt have any trouble replacing him and if he can get a $35K raise he should take it.The issue is that we are a GREAT company and have won a lot of local awards that stem from customer and employee nominations.  ‚ÄúBest of the city‚Ä¶‚Äù that sort of thing.  He doesn‚Äôt want to leave.  But I understand the pressures people feel financially.  Anyway, I just told him I think he‚Äôs a great guy and I‚Äôd hate to lose him.  He said he felt better because he wouldn‚Äôt be leaving me in the lurch.That‚Äôs how you do it right.  But here‚Äôs the rub: that was 3 days ago.  Maybe he‚Äôs just waiting on the formal offer.  Maybe he was just taking me for a ride.Because 6-7 months ago he called and said nearly the exact same thing.  I remember it vividly because I was sitting in the baggage claim area at Santa Barbara airport.  Then, as now, I recommended he take the job.I think this time might be real.  His customer emailed me to ask if I had a plan if the guy leaves.  (I do.)But we‚Äôll see.

            Bosses giving glowing reviews to employees wanting a transfer? Unloading dead wood on some other department. Not many repercussions, although those bosses do get found out.I also got stuck with one, a former Marine that my vet boss said ‚Äútarnished the green.‚Äù He mustered out abruptly, lying about sick leave, to a government job by using a veteran hiring preference and became a taxpayer burden. How many others like that take up space and resources around the country?

                One of the biggest fraud scams in America is the ‚Äúdisabled veteran‚Äù scam.  They get 10-20-30-100% disability payments for life.  Many earned it ‚Äì true line of duty injuries.

                Kids are just uncomplicated adults.   I used to teach physics, and kids lies are like a simplified physics problem where you ignore things like air resistance and friction.  They‚Äôre boiled down to the basics.  As they get older, they add complexity and sophistication.I‚Äôve taught every age from pre-K through college.  Plus dealing with their parents.  The best way to think of it is I had thousands of people in a continuum from age 4 to 40.  Every evolution of lying can be pinpointed in that continuum.Most little kids lie to protect themselves.  Teenagers lie to deceive and test boundaries.  Most adults lie for personal gain.

Well stated. I would add that females are more prone to engage in ‚Äúpractice lying‚Äù (i.e., ‚Äúno discernable objective‚Äù to the dishonesty) than are males.

                    This is one reason why the most ardent opponents of change can often be found among the common folk. Beautiful People may be the most pathological of liars, but they tend to be quite adaptive and savy as well. On the other hand, the good old boys from the pleb tend to become hopelessly corrupted into the Lie through servilism and conservatism, their lack of a silver tongue (and sophisticated double-think) puts them in a position of complete dependency. Only a radical change of hierarchy allows to scapegoat the old sins and provide catharsis/renewal.Democracy not only destroys the honesty, but also disrupts the natural hierarchy where aristocrats protect the plebeians from particularly degenerate behaviors they are not equipped to handle with their simple brains. Hypocrisy is the bedrock of Civilization and the tribute to Virtue is paid primarily by the elite. The Vice can only be revealed when they can no longer be bothered with the sacrifices.

        Considering the success and wealth of the GAE, I‚Äôd say the onus is on us to demonstrate why truth is better than lies. It would appear that all we have going for us on that front are admonitions from religious and philosophical books that truth is somehow preferable, but in the physical world such assertions seem questionable. Indeed, any value that truth possesses depends on the existence of a spiritual world and an afterlife where perfidy is punished. Otherwise, lamentations about the dishonest nature of the world are just sour grapes by people who are, for whatever reason, unwilling to lie to win.

        Democracy is ultimately about morality. Morality is subjective, and truth is always subordinate to any given moral perspective, although the latter invariably claims to be identical with the former.
All governments promote a moral vision, but democracy is the only one that pretends it doesn‚Äôt.

        At the risk of being a broken record here, I will just observe that when the Elites decided to run this system with no feedback, Truth became a commodity with minimal value. Americans understood ‚ÄúBS‚Äù: it‚Äôs the rhetorical lubricant required to advance political agendas. But Americans always hated ‚ÄúLies‚Äù: intentional deception. If you‚Äôre going to run the system with no feedback, you need to get comfortable with Lies.

        In the ‚Äòjudgment phase‚Äô of human history described in the Book of Revelation, the principal standard for evaluation of individuals is love of truth, or rejection of truth.  The point is made multiple times in that book, so nobody has any excuse for effing up.God places a very high value on probity, and Scripture personifies Truth in the individual Christ, who is both the source and the endpoint of all honesty.  We can extrapolate from there that truth likewise is crucial to the effective functioning of human groups, including societies.  Lying, including to oneself, is corrosive and anti-productive.1950s America was far more in touch with the truth than modern America.  Wokeness is the open rejection of the truth in favor of ideology and choice-identity that makes persons and groups Feel Good About Themselves i.e., self-deception.

You‚Äôve been dropping some grand comments today. Quite frankly, recognition and repentance of sin on the part of The Managers would be most beneficial ‚Äì especially for their souls. But I doubt that will happen.
In all my life, I can honestly say that nothing encourages self-reflection and self-correction like serious Christianity (not, of course, the co-opted Christianity that floats about in the mainstream).
God bless you and yours.

        The Sacklers should face a public trial and then crucified and gradually disemboweled.The grand strategist Brezhinski‚Äôs (sp?) daughter is emblematic of the type of lying that is a charade and farce. That is, she is a part of a dynastic family in the empire. She should recuse herself of being a, ‚Äújournalist.‚Äù To call her, an imperial promoter with a vested familial interest in the empire, a journalist and not a propagandist is yet another form of lying that is very common. In an honest society she would recuse herself or be harshly rebuked and removed from her position. In a more honest society, her familial dyansty would put up its own money and not the public‚Äôs to build and further her dynasty.It is so dynastic that her husband is right by her side every day. A double perfidy of a metrushka doll of perfidies all rolled into one.Of course it is likely that every person who appears on CNN is either a CIA asset or a member of the most protected and elevated of the many protected and elevated classes in the GAE and so grateful sinecures who will say anything if it means endless nights of twerking in Hooters in Guatemala and the Carribean.They say a feature of America is how innovative it is. It seems to be very innovative in the forms of lying it constantly invents and then embellishes. Well, America is gone, so let‚Äôs be honest and call it post-America.You once said something about the guillotines running 24√ó7 Z-Man. I think we‚Äôll know that the GAE Regime is dead when they‚Äôve run 24√ó7 until the deceivers have gone through that processing and have been expropriated back to some public trust. As for the dolts whose capacity for self-deception to believe this nonsense hook, line and sinker their total disenfrahchisement will be another critical sign we‚Äôve made it to the other side.Sorry for the eFFPost. If the Traditionalist underground is indeed playing the role of pushing the Overton window and bringing the truth and the solutions into the normal public discourse, then it is necessary.

            ‚ÄúThe Sacklers should face a public trial and then crucified and gradually disemboweled.‚ÄùYou bring up an interesting thought here.  The aspect of punishment as in atonement vs punishment as in future prevention/deterrent of such activity.For example, one might think that such punishment as you describe will deter others from such behavior, but will it?  Two aspects need to be considered:  punishment and probability of detection or getting caught.We saw this in late 19th century Britain where there were some 90+ laws on the books that prescribed capital punishment for crimes as petty as ‚Äúpickpocketing‚Äù.   Yet crime rose all the same.  Indeed in some cases the public ostensibly being ‚Äúprotected‚Äù by these laws called for them to be mollified or repealed because juries would not convict given the penalty imposed‚Äîmaking the law ineffective.My general thinking here is that we need more enforcement/detection/prosecution and perhaps less penalty imposed upon conviction.  What we see here is a general laziness of our elected officials who increase penalties for laws they refuse to enforce, since enforcement most often entails increased expense.  Whereas increased penalties involve nothing except a line in the criminal statutes and is often good for campaigning for re-election as ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù.There is a good test of this theory, which I‚Äôve discussed with those who promote a ‚Äútough on crime stance‚Äù.  One that I‚Äôve *never* received an answer from those I‚Äôve posed such.  I ask them ‚ÄúHow many crimes of such and such have been committed?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow many criminals for such crimes have been caught and tried.‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow many criminals have committed the same crime again.‚ÄùUsually, the second question is noted as ‚Äúwoefully few‚Äù, and at that point I note the unreasonableness of raising a penalty for a crime where the odds of being caught are ‚Äúnil‚Äù.

                In the Sackler, Mayorkas ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ (long long long list) ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ case, it is atonement and deterrent.It is a signal that a new regime has arrived. It is a statement that the treasons this person committed are intolerable and do not go unpunished to suit the crime.The Sacklers willfully addicted White men, those who served the nation in its foreign wars, to opioids. That is evil.Mayorkas is willfully dispossessing a nation of its homeland and fostering an invasion and colonial settlement. That is evil.They and all who abet them must face a brutal punishment and end. That won‚Äôt end treason, that won‚Äôt end drug dealing, but it will radically temper its scale and scope and the person who does it in the future. The highest echelons of power? No. The dregs. Sure. We can live with that.Most of all, it signals that the new people in charge recognize the crimes against the people of the nation/country and that they will punish those who committed them. This is critical, for without doing so, the incoming regime is not legitimate and a shadow of doubt will always linger over them. Were they conspirators?We‚Äôll know we are at the end, when these signs are raised in the public squares.

            I believe there is a point to be made on how the culture of egalitarianism corrupts the elite so deeply they become both degenerate and resentful. Both privileges and duties become formally democratized which forces the elite into an endless spiral of deception to maintain the natural order and pay the lip service at the same time. As a result we get absurdities with anti-homeless, rainbow-painted boulders, refusal to deal with social refuse by unleashing them onto the peasants, glorification of primitive (noble) savagery while at the same time elite dreams grow even more fanciful (the Great Reset) and escapist.In a secular, moralist, egalitarian society, the position of an intelectual/journalist is the only one that wields moral legitimacy. Thus there can be no more Lords or Holy Men, only dream-weavers and quasi-priests. Men forced into pretending to be equals grow increasingly resentful of their condition and the sight od peasants only reminds them how much of a disgrace it is to be a public figure. In such environment only the most wretched, debased and amoral can thrive.

            The ‚Äúnoble lie‚Äù seems to be the favorite lie of this era. Frequently delivered by ‚Äúexperts‚Äù (e.g., Fauci), it is intended to prevent the rubes from making the mistake of judging matters for themselves and coming to the wrong conclusions. No absurdity is beyond the pale when it comes to the noble lie and the liars can be sure of backup from the media if the rubes suspect they are being played. The fact that a financial motive lies behind many of these lies does tarnish the noble part a bit but all is fair in the war against rubedom.

            It would seem to depend on how expansive ‚Äúreal rulers‚Äù is defined.

                    My point/question is whether there is an actual hierarchical distinction between those who truly believed it, as the Clouds apparently did, and the persons who lied and led them to believe it, the Managers. No question it was on paper a tremendous investment opportunity. The Clouds indeed were wrong but it seemingly was based on false information provided to them since the intelligence and military apparat almost certainly knew how the Ukraine war would shake out.So it remains unclear, at least to me, as to whether the Managers are part of the Real Rulers. That they could lie with such impunity and cause such potential investment losses would indicate they are, but there is a lot of contrary evidence such as the recent election results‚Äìthe Managers wanted a certain outcome and the Clouds seemed at a minimum ambivalent. Things are so opaque that we can‚Äôt see what is happening (this is why I bristle at discussing the GAE in terms of democracy), but there apparently is an ongoing factional war and the Managers and at least a portion of the Clouds appear at odds. That struggle, if it is in fact one, will determine quite a bit about our lives.

                    It‚Äôs hard for me to believe that any informed person believed the war was winnable by Ukraine. Little old me, with only  a regular guy‚Äôs access to information and a bit of logic sized up the war as a lost cause as soon as it began (Russia being much larger and stronger than Ukraine and the Russians being a tough bunch). I think these commercial interests figured they would come out ahead no matter who won.

                        There may have been hedges and offsets with MIC investments, but it is hard to see how sinking billions of dollars into land not available to someone would be profitable. What you wrote is indeed possible, but many Clouds literally outsource every bit of information provided to them so they do in effect live in a bubble. It normally works for them but then something like this happens.

                My wife had Tucker on yesterday and I overheard a bit where he was talking to Greenwald about how instantly and profoundly Mike Johnson had changed his positions and personality after he got a talking-to from ‚Äúintelligence.‚Äù They were stuck on the idea that he was traditionally compromised, blackmailed or whatever. And Johnson‚Äôs an obvious target for it, some kind of gay sex creep who pretends he isn‚Äôt.Contradicting their thesis, I think, Tucker noted that behind the scenes Johnson had started telling him things that made no sense and were totally crazy and ‚Äúincoherent,‚Äù with a True Believer glaze over his eyes, giving Tucker the ‚Äúif only you knew‚Ä¶‚Äù treatment.Of course Tucker didn‚Äôt *say the things*‚Äînot his job!‚Äîbut he gave evidence for something I already believe, so I‚Äôll take it: They‚Äôre not just ‚Äúperformatively‚Äù crazy, reciting the liturgy of their class, etc. They‚Äôre *axiomatically* crazy, acting out principle(s) even more insane than the insane things they say to us.

            I think you need to account for the fact that women are now heavily involved in the policymaking and bureaucratic operations these days. It‚Äôs a major change that is not discussed because, well, we all know why it is not. In the past, the bureaucracy was run by serious men who understand the game and its consequences. Now, not so much. I just heard a clip of some policy bimbo snarking about Putin‚Äôs discussion of nuclear protocol and she was giggling about how it is irrelevant, he is just afraid and insecure and blustering. Compare this to the seriousness with which our government treated the nuclear threat during the Cold War ‚Äì there is a great book called ‚ÄúCommand and Control‚Äù that went into it, and also even with that seriousness, we still came close to nuclear many times. She sees the world as her high school cafeteria and how she can jockey for status, and that includes putting other people down instead of treating what they say seriously. That is our government now. It is like how Sweden‚Äôs bimbo joined up with NATO because it made her feel good and like one of the cool kids, and now they are distributing pamphlets about the risk of war to the populace.

                This is the correct answer, regardless of topic. It is tedious and pointless to discuss politics, managerialism, communism, democracy, or anything else as long as women remain empowered.
Speaking of honesty, the greatest lie ever believed is not just that women are as competent as men, but that they are even competent in any objective sense.

                Very bright take. While elections do not matter really as far as the trajectory of things, the recent one appeared to be a fairly straight forward reassertion of masculine dominance. This potentially suicidal reaction of nuclear chicken is indeed what should be respected from a matriarchy, particularly a wounded one.

        It seems to me that the biggest issue re all the lying is the lack of consequences, or at least serious ones.  If I jump off a 20 story building or drive into a tree at a100 miles an hour, there will be terminal consequences.  Rarely, if ever for the lying liars.  Further, large swaths of the populace are pathetically gullible and lap the slop up.  Maybe one of these  days, years, decades or centuries, it‚Äôll change‚Ä¶

            Good point. A large chunk of the public has already given up on believing anything out of the regime.  Regime media seems to soldier on through carrier fees and advertising from drug companies.As the generation that grew up believing everything the TV told them dies off something has to give here.  More and more though people just seem to be willing to shrug and accept we have turned into a low trust society.

                    Something is going on. Popular shows on Thursday night used pull down over 20 million viewers, now the top rated shows are barely getting 6 million. NBC is still running multiple Law &amp; Order series as political propaganda that are getting lower ratings than moderately successful YouTubers.  Eventually someone has to pull the plug on this, it is just a question of what the trigger will be.

            I tend toward analogies, so I think of the barbarians that dwell to our north that speak a version of our language and I get Canadians.   I guess that is analogy failure‚Äì I don‚Äôt see a Phillip or Alexander arriving from the Great White North.

                Good point, but look to the south‚Äìperhaps there‚Äôs a Pinochet equivalent, even a home-grown one.  Coups have not been common in English√®speaking countries, but they‚Äôve been a feature of South American political life.

                    A coup would seem easier when you have a completely centralized government and civilian police as opposed to a more decentralized one with somewhat independent States or Provences.

                    There are many admirable features of Latin culture.  I never imagined that military coups were something worthy of ‚Äúcultural appropriation‚Äù, but this old dog can learn to appreciate a new trick.
Augusto Pinochet reborn, or Nayib Bukele, on a white horse crossing the Rio Grande would be a God send.
