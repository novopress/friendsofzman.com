        I am curious – if the BOYS were between the age of 14 and 17, that means that at least some of the boys – in addition to being legal minors – were also probably below the legal age of consent.
I mention this because, in those cases, the GIRLS having sex with them would be guilt of the same crime that the BOYS were arrested for.  Oddly enough, though, there is no mention of any girls being arrested.
Strange, huh?

            It is a great question. I think normal people accept there being a difference between boys and girls, but the people making these decisions are not normal. They keep telling us that sex is social construct.

        It was black football players doing what black football players do. So it’s either rape, or vicious racial oppression, depending on who you are.
