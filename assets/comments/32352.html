        I don’t know what’s creepier:
Every journalist in America shouting from the rooftops about what a hero, statesman, and Lyin’ of the Senate Ole’ Joe was
OR
How dignified, smart, stunning and brave Kamala is. All of her many, many achievements.  The whole left just started parroting the script.
It’s Orwellian. But this is what’s going in the history books.

            Honestly, I’m at some personal risk during the upcoming Kamala campaign.
She is so obviously stupid that when the entire media starts shouting that she is brilliant and accomplished, I am afraid that my brain may break.

                She can’t even cut a convincing ActBlue promo for YouTube.
Sounds totally fake, struggles to read the basic lines on the teleprompter.

            The prepared narrative is Joe passing the torch to Kamala, in a final selfless act of public service, knowing he cannot go on with the struggle to Save our Democracy. It is obvious that all this has been planned, and that Joe had no hand in any of it. You are correct; it’s Orwellian. It wouldn’t surprise me if Jill is right now being held in isolation so that she can’t speak to the Media, undergoing a struggle session to get her mind right before they allow her to go public.

            It’s reminiscent of the Stalinist era Soviet Union, when the regime would literally excise from photographs once prominent party members who had fallen out of favor.  It was like they had never existed.

        Nothing should be accepted by any government official via social media. Those crap tweets coming from Biden’s X account last week are all obviously written by someone else and more importantly without his knowledge.
The actual election in November is going to the greatest shit show con job of all time.

            I believe there was an incident where that foreign black woman with the toilet brush hairdo had accidentally gotten her and Biden’s Twitter accounts crossed up in a posting which revealed that she was the one running it.  At no point in time was Biden like “ah that reads great, now to post it to Twitter”.

            Absolutely no doubt. I mean, where is Jill? Where is the President? Where is the goofy black chick with her notebook? There has been a palace coup, and the Media plus all the usual political suspects are in on it. Why aren’t people like Schumer and Pelosi interested in what the President has to say, instead of enthusiastically backing Harris all of a sudden? “My” governor, the stunningly idiotic Kathy Hochal, has announced her total support for Harris; quoth she: “Kamala Harris is the perfect choice for us to defend our democracy in what is the most important election of our time”.You would think that somebody might want some confirmation from the President. Nope. The ship has sailed and for all we know he’s been sedated all this time.

                All the stories this afternoon are that Biden might ackshuallyhavedied recently [or is struggling in something akin to an ICU setting].
A big FAA flight restriction just went up around Biden’s beach palace in Delaware.
Both Charlie Kirk &amp; (((Laura Loomer))) are claiming that something is seriously wrong chez Rehoboth Beach [far worse even than the status quo we had come to expect from the Biden Fambly Crime Syndicate].

                            I’m in Taiwan at the moment and on Thursday, from 1PM to 2PM, we’re having what might be called an air raid drill.  You are not allowed to be out on the street for that hour, all traffic and commerce will cease.
Now, let me be clear, this type of preparedness drill has occured regularly for decades.  I’ve been here for them before.  It’s not in response to any heightened state of tension, but it’s a reminder that even the status quo has its perils.

        That’s the second presidency in a row that’s been putsched.
We have now reached a point where the poles have reversed. The “conspiracy theories” are often far more plausible and sober minded than official narratives.

            Agreed.
as far as conspiracy vs narrative though… I wonder. I think Washington is on chaos and no one’s in charge.
The power vacuum deepens. Historically when the elite implodes, there is a fight for control that will see a series of leaders rise and fall as they fight amongst themselves. Eventually the strong man comes forth and ends it.

                        One thing is for sure. No intelligent military officer can still sincerely hold on to the old moral absolute obligation to remain subordinate to the civil authorities. Taking their own leadship’s admitted flouting of this old constraint, like Miley, when the civil leadership was legitimately elected, never mind when the civil authority is plainly illegitimate as it is now, the door is morally wide open to use their own moral judgement about what to do and who to take orders from. Most will take orders from money I suppose but with no actual loyalty or sense of duty or cause. Reminds me of 2001 when the Bush version of the regime was unable to even name the enemy and instead pretended we were at war with Nihilism, which is so absurd it makes me laugh as I recall it. The irony now is that military officers taking orders from obviously depraved and disgusting people with obviously evil intent are at best truly serving in the cause of Nihilism.

            Yeah that Trump’s shooting really just turned him into a whole different figure, a mythological figure, and at the same time the whole Republican platform catered on everything, abortion, gay marriage, LGBT and of course we already know they’ll be infinite money for Israel. And the two white men ticket, will that make white men want to join the military again?There’s nothing for me at the RNC anymore and then Trump gave that speech and talked about getting shot and he said “I’ll never talk about this again because it was so traumatic” and then he went on to describe everything that happened afterwards how he put his hand up to his ear and there was covered in blood and he went down and there was just so much blood. None of that’s true. There was no blood on his hand or on his cuff or on his white shirt it was actually very little blood just the two streaks on his face and then it looked like it already congealed on his ear and I just all of a sudden went wait did this really happen? And now I don’t know.

        I think, had his plan to kill Trump worked, he would not have had to quit the race. You have to feel sorry for him, though, because the assassination plan worked, really. You got a shooter with an adequate rifle within easy distance. He takes a good-enough shot to win, but well…It’s like designing a critical drive with time running out, you get the the 10 yard line and send the kicker out for the chip shot to win the game. And he shanks it.I think the best explanation for Biden’s removal is simply his failure to kill Trump.

            But Biden didn’t plan anything; he is a lifeless husk.  And I can’t say with total certainty whether the assassination was as a botched SS/intelligence hit OR Trump himself orchestrated it.  It’s just so bizarre.

                But why would Trump orchestrate it? He was already leading. Biden was already fading. Why go to such lengths in an effort to gain a “bump” in those circumstances?

        Feeling a bit black-pilled this morning. Biden has publicly turned into a small cloud of dust, as it seemed he always must. Simultaneously, the MAGA ticket has a Frum-groomed protege in the Veep spot, and a national convention featuring (so I read) prayers to Vishnu and a ‘model’ from only-fans.  Normie’s trudge is that of an M C Escher print, wherein the drudges put one foot endlessly in front of another, slowly overcoming lies one step at at time, only somehow to return to the point from which they started, an unidentifiable slight of hand having somewhere caused ‘up’ to be ‘down’.  It takes so long to start any type of movement, left or right, that long before it has gotten anywhere it has been co-opted by grifters and deep-state cut-outs [‘deep-state’ == CIA, presumably]

            You have good reason to be blackpilled. The GOP convention had no reference to anything outside of itself or Trump.
Our heritage is being dismantled — past tense, probably — and the one “trad” party ran four days of a convention with porn stars and litigious Hebrew Harvard Democrats on stage. Not a single reference to anything remotely historical.
It’s gone. Whatever you and I are holding onto, nobody else gives a shit. Even the people we “agree with.”

                You are correct. It’s all gone.People talk about “the red pill”, they talk about dissidence, they talk about ” our side of the Divide”.Therealred pill is fully internalizing that we are men without a country. We are the Stationary Diaspora, and the events we are watching have nothing to do with us. Biden won’t seek re-election; Kamala Harris is making empty mouth noises; the RNC genuflects to porn whores and demon gods.For those of us who mourn the loss of our country and our civilization we may as well be in the town square of a remote British fishing village hearing tales that the emperor appointed his favorite horse to the Senate.We are only witnesses to the fever dream of the Vandals who have subjugated us.

                Whether consensus or not that is the correct take. Making the system further discredit itself is a worthy goal as long as people do not delude themselves into thinking it can be saved. Whites are despondent and suicidal, but unlike the Indians before them the system itself cannot survive without them, and the system is hellbent on white genocide. In that sense the system itself is suicidal.

                                You’re thinking of the Australians, who actually held out at Tobruk for 231 days until they were relieved by the British Eighth Army.

                                    There were two sieges of Tobruk.  The Australians were in there first and held out.  In the second stanza, it was the South Africans who unexpectedly ended up in this coastal desert resort and subsequently…POW camps.
In fairness, the SA Tobruk was never supposed to be a fortress but a rear echelon logistics base with most of its defenses removed and repurposed.  The Saffas were put in there at the last minute in the panic stations phase of a disastrous British operation against Rommel.

                    Nearly half of Whites are 100% onboard with accepting their dhimmitude and servitude don’t forget.This place won’t collapse when people like us are no longer and those in charge understand this. Endless decades of propaganda and Semitic poison have made the younger generations compliant and servile sheep.They will gladly keep the wheels turning for the DEI overlords. This was the best trick yet pulled by our (((friends))). They aren’t forced to do anything, the Good Whites, and they are now legion, truly love Big Brotha.It is hubris to assume this is all going to collapse and you will die bitter and disappointed. This is going to limp on for many many decades to come because of what I just stated above. Plan accordingly, or sit on your hands and watch in idle bitterness. Whichever you prefer.

                        I’m looking at it as “the whites have spored.”it appears to be seasonal.Now what matters is how lasting the diffusion is, and where there will be enough to spore again.I’d rather not we end up mere traces of a genetic memory.Perhaps that’s why our signatory markers, such as skin, hair, and eye color, are of relatively recent vintage; we, the fair flowers, are only a seasonal version, now a fading bloom.Our percentage of the global population peaked in 1940; now that great sporing, the World Wars, has spread our ways and our genes (again) across the earth.  it even produced the technologies of that spread, of globalism itself.The “lefties” or whatever you may call them, are the outbreeders of White, the disseminators, the sacrificial lambs that will be captured to upgrade the non-whites.You see, the great question, the only real question, is if that diffusion is enough to expand the populating of the Seeding layer (“Heaven”, that is, open the Gates, adding a greater depth of stored information re organic experience), or if the diffusion will be weakened to the point that the driver of the non-white breeders will pull all back into the greenhouse for breakdown and recycling.(Hell’s influence, the Yahweh, in other words, the awakened force whose job it is to recapture and compost the sparse amount of nested information structure, both organic and immaterial, of the living layer.)Did our sporing, preceded as it was when we went a-viking across the oceans, widen the gates of heaven, or will our diffusion end up with all dragged back into bestial senescence?  A dead flower of a planet, no longer casting its radiant panspermia as a signal and seed?Despite our (my) great and terrible failure, we do have expanded maps, now, of Hell’s structure.  Perhaps it is time to turn our eyes towards measuring Heaven’s growth.Rather, to measuring the Gates themselves.   What percentage of White genes are enough to grant passage through the keyhole?Will the Gates remain open, or will they not?Worse, much worse, which Gates yawn the widest?Those above or those below?

                What kind of symbolic act or pressure release is joining the Republicans allowed to be? It’s important.Judged by the convention, the only break from current_year that the GOP represents is some redneck-marketing nostalgia (sponsored by Bud Light). Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock arenot from this century.What’s permitted symbolically—what dissent canappear—has shrunk a lot in the past few days. The RNC was a celebration of the shrinkage. The Party came out as the DNC’s very, very heavily “gay coded” Indian mascot. It’s a notable change of dress, perhaps accomplished with a bullet—perhaps meant to bedifferentlyaccomplished with that bullet…Whoseis the apparatus that finds and deploys “lone” shooters? Some Republican fag, maybe? I mean, if we’re gonna conspiracy-theory, let’s at least fit all our known knowns in there.

                Reasonable point.   My black pill regarded the ongoing *perception* of the system, rather than the system itself (which I know, of course, to be unfixable). There isn’t going to be a ‘wake up’ moment that many in these parts, even, seem to expect.  The system can seemingly effortlessly produce sufficient lies to replace those in the process of being dispelled.Even here, many seem to think that the breakdown of the Dems leads to a ‘happening’ (be that civil war, or whatever). It won’t.  The new next thing will be coopted like the last next thing.I’m not really black-pilled.  But hope lies with relationships with God and with our neighbor.  Not mass movement.

                Just so. If the Power Structure installs some bizarre Dem–is there any other kind?–we know dam’ well the sorts of perverse and dieverse initiatives that will be coming down the pipe. If it decides to let Trump win, we know he will have been compromised and emasculated and therefore will be able to do very little to arrest the P&amp;D his Dem opponent would have pushed. We are well and truly in a post-electoral environment.
Separation is the only solution.

        ” We have reached the point where only a fool accepts the official truth, which opens the door for everyone with a clever imagination to conjure alternatives.”Everything we’re told is pretty much a lie and has been for over 60 years, and the people still keep on eating it up, especially the “vote harder” folks. They won’t wake up until they’re wiping their asses on 100 Dollar Bills, and the economy of the country has gone belly-up.When reality raises its head and can no longer be explained away, it’s going to get mean, and I mean mad-dog killing mean.

                LOL, We all know people like that, but be consoled about this: There are times of history when lots of stupid people eat shit then die. You know, the ones you’d never feel sorry for. There is justice, and sometimes it comes in the form of fate.

        America today:I do not believe Biden is dead.I would not be surprised in the least if Biden were dead.This is every previous totalitarian regime, too.“Biden” will not resign because it would require Harris to assume office. She cannot be allowed to do so until polls are conducted to determine whether she will be installed at the kabuki convention. If it appears she can win or not bleed out too much Harris gets the nod. Otherwise look for Oprahmania or something else that stupid.All of us have expected fortification, and while that remains quite possible, this shitshow indicates it also may not be possible. The Regime simply may decide to continue to rule by force and co-opt Trump if overtly cheating would be too messy.The GAE is falling apart in real time and the wheels have come off the Democratic Party, and neither of those two things really matter as far as who the ringmaster is. Long term for the GAE, though, the date of the curtain falling keeps being pushed closer to the present.

        I still remember the Super Tuesday in 2020 where all of Biden’s opponents all quit at the same time and endorsed him. Never have I seen the amount of blatant backroom shenanigans at that day, all to make sure Trump getting a second term didn’t happen.Now he hasn’t gone away, is in the lead, and the mess they made by installing Biden with Kamala as life insurance has serious potential of destroying their chances of controlling the empire in perpetuity, going as far as dismantling everything altogether. What should have been a victory lap is now a struggle for survival.

            You can thank the odious South Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn for this mess. In the SC Primary in 2020 he flat out told Ol’ Joe he’d only support him if Joe nominated a “Woman of Color” to be his VP.Per La Wiki:“Before the primary on February 26, House Majority Whip and longtime U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn endorsed Biden. Many cited Clyburn’s endorsement as a reason for Biden’s wide margin of victory, as Clyburn’s endorsement was a deciding factor for many African American voters in South Carolina. Thirty-six percent of all primary voters said that they made their decision after Clyburn’s endorsement; of that total, 70% voted for Biden.”﻿

                The 80s were okay up until 1987, when GM decided to make all of their new cars front-wheel drive, and God were they junk. Everything became a dead man standing at that point.

                I was also making noise in the 90s about how bad it’s going to get, only to be met with puzzling looks.  But I was reading Buchanan and Francis, along with books like AlienNation, Revolt of the Elites, Civil War 2, and subscribed to Chronicles, all who saw what was coming.

                        To the many people saying, “Fine. Who’s your pick for VP?” whenever JD Vance is objected to, I say, “Ross Perot Jr.”
But finding and recruitinghimwould take unlimited funds, an army of hirelings to do all the legwork, and 40+ years of rubbing shoulders with the rich and powerful in both social, financial, and political circles.
Naturally Trump couldn’t possibly track Jr. down and talk it over with him.

            It was the flower of my sometimes misspent youth. One night, the official music for white people was switched from vapid Sunset Strip-style hair metal to whiny grunge from Seattle heroin addicts and god-awful gangsta rap from the parts of the city you never visited. MTV got the memo and switched from Poison and Motley Crue to Pearl Jam and Nirvana, along with Yo! MTV Raps.The 1990s was like a dream in many ways. The tech boom insulated our ruling class from repercussions of their policies. Clinton was banging every woman within groping distance and was the most conservative (in terms of policy) president of our lifetime. We bombed places just to give our military something to do in the post-Cold War malaise.I finished engineering school and got my masters in the 1990s. I had a family, bought a house and was living the great suburban life of cookouts, summer vacations, yard work and other pursuits. My job, despite the so-called Peace Dividend, was still lucrative and fun.I always wanted to be a pilot, but I found my check rides in a T-38 Talon supersonic trainer a bit claustrophobic at 6-4, so I opted to fly what the Air Force calls “trash haulers” and found a great second gig that helped pay the bills. It was fun flying twice a week in addition to a weekend per month and two weeks in the summer.And then 9/11 ended the party. I was called up to active duty. I spent the early 2000s hauling stuff in Iraq in a C-130, including lots of patriotic young men dying for nothing and being sent home in flag-draped caskets.I became bitter and cynical. The system I once believed in was a complete sham. I started to realize that there were genetic differences between the races.Then I crossed over the great divide and here I am.

                Steve Perry Journey and Pat Benatar was peak White people music.  They were all over MTV before they got unceremoniously dumped for grunge and gangsta rap.“I spent the early 2000s hauling stuff in Iraq in a C-130, including lots of patriotic young men dying for nothing and being sent home in flag-draped caskets.”Makes me shiver, because I was almost one of those young fools.  Just a dumb kid when 911 happened and bought the narrative hook line and sinker and was ready to fight for “my country”.  Applied to the Army, but for the grace of God didn’t join.

        Kamala Harris as president* would be the greatest advertisement AGAINST Affirmative Action we’ve ever had. If dissidents knew what was good for them, they would quietly root for Harris (rooting for her would hardly require voting for her, as only a sap would vote for anyone at this point).*The president is just a puppet. Therefore, who holds the office matters only in terms of its effect on public perception and has no bearing on how the system operates.

Was the plan to sh00t Trump, then have Biden step down a week later? Then they can run 2 milquetoast regime approved candidates (with no dementia).
Or was the plan to keep Biden in, once Trump was gone, and have him “win” a rigged election against Nikki? But since Trump is still here, they need Biden to step down.
Either way, it feels like Biden stepping down is now one part of a pre-scripted series of events. As usual, Trump went off-script and screwed up their harebrained plans.

            Perhaps the tell is that the day after the failed assassination, Haley was invited to speak at the RNC, which she accepted, and then endorsed Trump. Struck me as possibly an “our plan failed, so we submit” moment.

            If “they” were seriously trying to kill Trump (and it is entirely possible they were, though the conspiracies are not without merit IMO), why is there no recourse to the initial failure?If one is willing to kill a political rival, wouldn’t one also be willing to try again?“Oh no, the morphodite we hired to run the trigger missed. Darn it! Well, no choice now but to accept defeat and carry out this other set of plans that don’t really serve our interests well.”Trump killed the Iranian General by remote control, yes? Does anyone who reads and posts here believe for a moment that the Rulers would be morally reluctant to do the same, then have the Alphabets and the Kibbutz Media pin it on White supremacists, or Russians, or Chinese nationalists bent on destroying freedom in Hong Kong, or any number of narratives beneficial to their Rule I can’t think of at the moment?How hard would it be to eliminate Trump, really, given the limitless resources and swarms of willing hatchet men at their command? Poison his Big Mac, drop a clock radio in his bathtub, sabotage the engines on Air Force One. Oh no, what a terrible tragedy/accident!!!The idea that the Dems are being driven to doanythingon account of a failed assassination attempt doesn’t seem very plausible to me.

                They are willing to kill a rival, but they are not willing to be seen killing a rival, of which a 2nd attempt dramatically increases the risk. The facade of legitimacy is paramount. We have seen before, in other ways, how they are willing to act draconian up to a point but walk it back when there is resistance. Perhaps kind of the same ethos here.
I believe this is the kind of thinking that could have animated them short term, in the barely a week now since the failure.

                    But here’s the rub–given the idiocy of the masses who will believe literally anything, how hard is it for the Power Structure to sustain its legitimacy? So degraded is the intelligence of the public that the PS can do practically anything and not suffer a catastrophic loss of legitimacy. Therefore, further attempts on Trump’s life would produce no consequences for the PS.

                I think squeezing Biden out and replacing him with Harris–or whoever–is simply insurance in case further liquidation attempts fail. But make no mistake, if another opportunity to kill Trump arises, they’re going to take it. That’s still squarely on the table.

            They tried to end the Trump menace one and for all, and failed. Instead, they made him stronger, which necessitated defenestrating Joey Depends and replacing him with a candidate who could conceivably beat Trump in the event that they can’t kill him before the election.
But who is the candidate? Kamaltoe probably doesn’t stand much more of a chance of winning than did JD. Yet the rulers appear to be lining up behind her. And once you’ve gone public with your endorsement you really can’t retract it. Kamaltoe as the nominee is the oddest piece of this entire deranged puzzle.

Oh, yes, yes you can.
If the polling before the DNC is so bad fortification even appears out of reach, expect those endorsements to sleep with the War (or Peace) with Eastasia and the fishes.

        This is all news to me but does not surprise me in the slightest.It was clear that the Covid pretext was to get Biden under wraps while the powers-that-be in the regime decided what to do with his worthless carcass. It’s also been clear for a long time that Biden has never had any agency of his own — he’s just been a performing ape who has increasingly not even been able to perform. After the “debate” last month it was clear the jig was up, and that became doubly true when some leading Democrats started voicing their “reservations” and “concerns.” The only thing not clear was how the hit would be engineered. But you have now filled in the details.

            I listened to an Auron McIntyre podcast this morning where, after the Trump assassination attempt, he figured any Dem candidate would be cruising for a loss so the smart thing for the regime to do would be to let Biden be the one to do it and that it would be stupid to try and change him out at this point.  He was right of course, but…My only thought is that Biden was becoming too much of a drag on down-ballot races and while the inner party could deal with Biden going down, they weren’t big fans of losing every contested race in the country at the same time too.

Who is a stoner and fuckup. But also don’t give a fuck. And is not going to be bullied into quitting.  So there’s either going to be an epic brawl to dump her or the establishment is going to ride with her off a cliff.   They’ll have to figure out right quick which is the lesser damaging to them long term.

            BTW all of this is proof that the establishment isn’t playing 4 dimensional chess or following some master plan.
The smart move for them would have been Biden announcing before primary season that he wasn’t running for reelection.  Then Harris would have had to compete – and lost out in the primaries – and they’d get a plausible faceman as their puppet.

                Yeah my takeaway from all these shenanigans is the regime is as lazy and incompetent as I thought. They have and will continue to let the msm work overtime to twist all these machinations into a narrative they can all fall in line with. Not that the msm and their affiliated intelligentsia aren’t indolent themselves.

                I wouldn’t use the term but there definitely is a “master plan”—let’s call it End Whiteness, as they do—proceeding without interruption. It’s the wave under the foam. PR screwups and palace intriguesfloat on it.
That sounds like a stupid thing Moldbug would say. I mean it seriously. What’s the “discourse” about the Democrats trying to juggle a new president into place?It can’t be a white guy. The people won’t have it!

        It is unlikely that there was a scene at the family home where Steve Ricchetti presented the already written letter to Biden and said, “I either get your signature or your brains on this letter” but this decision was obviously not a voluntary.
Too bad, Biden could’ve gone Jack Woltz on Ricchetti: “Now you get the hell out of here! And if that goomba tries any rough stuff, you tell him I ain’t no bandleader. Yeah, I heard that story.”

        I’ve been paraphrasing your “they never think past step 1” column for a while now.First President to quit via email? And zero public comment? Something is very wrong. There’s a good case to be made that someone released a letter on Biden’s Twitter account, and now the Biden’s are being dared to dispute it.Just how bad would they look if it became known that they have so little control over things that a nobody released a letter on Twitter that changed the political landscape – all without the knowledge of the President? Absolutely catastrophic.Then you can almost hear TPTB screaming “you left out Harris!” leading to another non-attributable Tweet a bit later.All of this gives me hope because it is evidence that THERE IS NO PLAN. They’re like the Underpants Gnomes.Step 1: remove BidenStep 2: ???Step 3: Victory!This is oddly similar to their strategy to keep Trump out of office, I might add.

        “They now have a month to figure out how to find someone who is plausible enough as a candidate so that when the rigging machine kicks in on election night, the results are plausible enough to accept.”With the media unflinchingly claiming biden was the most popular president of all time while simultaneously admitting to “fortifying” that election the benchmark of plausibility is essentially non existent. That’s what makes removing biden so strange, I don’t even know who they’re doing this for if that’s actually the concern. I think it’s more likely that they want someone who can get people motivated enough to drive those printed ballots around to the drop boxes but that too is a silly reason. They could shut down elections altogether &amp; absolutely nothing would happen, people would be mad but they’re already mad &amp; it’s not like that has ever changed anything.Seems to me that they’re doing election theater for themselves, it certainly isn’t being done in an attempt to convince anyone who actually cares about this country. This is reminiscent of a pathological liar telling you a completely outlandish lie about something. It’s not done not to convince you, because he doesn’t really care what you believe, but to satisfy his impulse &amp; maintain the solipsistic illusion he’s a good person. It’s that but with a democracy framing, the logic being that it’s not a lie if you believe it.

                Replace good person with plausibility, biden is the face of their horrific policies which they’d never admit to being bad but they understand the man himself &amp; his policies are terrible optics so removing him maintains their plausibility. It’s like the obama hope &amp; change that doesn’t amount to anything except directed towards themselves, I mean assuming there’s no other reason for them to do this. The only thing I know for certain is that they’re not replacing biden because of concern about how voters view him, it just can’t be the reason. As Arthur has pointed out in this comment thread they have been openly rigging their primaries so obviously optics aren’t important to them.Thinking about it more, perhaps it’s not about plausibility to the voters but putting someone in office that israel likes since trump is their current favorite. Biden has slipped up &amp; said things that pissed them off like saying he thinks bibi is trying to drag the US into a war with iran. That’s the sort of optics they care about, perhaps removing biden is a compromise to keep them happy &amp; also keep trump out.

        “The people running the White House agreed to this, but not to Harris becoming president.”
Why would they object to Harris?  She’ll play ball.  She has no honor and no soul.  What she lacks is a solid constituency.  She’s got the fembot vote, but the Democrats were always going to get that vote even if they ran a carrot for President.

        Biden was told the 28 minutes in which the Secret Service did not interfere with Thomas Crooks while he set up his kill shot on Trump was more than enough time for someone to put a pillow over Biden’s face. That and the fact that asphyxia is a common symptom of his Covid.

        To my mind, the crises that Biden led the country through were largely mass panics driven by the media for the benefit of his donors. I think Biden is actually saying that in spite of these crises, his regime made sure the elites could extract even more tributes from the vassals.

        The 22nd Amendment only prevents a person from being ELECTED president more than twice. If Harris were to select Obama as her running mate, it would be constitutional. And then if Harris were to accidentally drown in her tub, there would be nothing to prevent Obama stepping back into the White House. Either way, strap in for a wild ride this fall.

            Obama just wants to run things from behind the scenes.  Gives him plenty of time to hang out at Martha’s Vineyard, golf, watch the NBA and HBO.  He doesn’t want to deal with the tedious and time consuming aspects of being President, he hated them when he was President.  The big tell will be how big an idiot they find to run with Kamala.

        So in our Fake and Gay repeat of 1860, Chomo Joe Biden just got the James Buchanan treatment. Kamala Harris is more or less in the same position as Buchanan’s Vice President, John Breckenridge, politically. She’s a modern Fire Eater. The “moderate” Democrat has yet to emerge to split the Democrats in half at the Convention of 1860/2024, as a moderate is absolutely unacceptable to the modern Fire Eaters, just as the Harris faction is unacceptable to the Democrats who have watched her and Joe and their handlers do nothing but fail miserably for four years-fail to destroy the Bad Orange Man, especially, fail in Ukraine, fail to consolidate the one party state. Failing the Party means purges have to happen, literally with a clock ticking down. So there will emerge a Democrat to take the role of Stephen Douglas at the convention.Little Bobby Kennedy will play the role of John Bell and the Constitutional Union Party.And you have the bad Orange Man playing Lincoln in this drama, because the modern Fire Eaters will go to the gun if he is elected. He can win the election just like Lincoln did in 1860, not on the ballot in some states (looking right at you, Cali and NY) and 35% of the popular vote. Because if the Democrats can’t get their shit together in a week or so, they split in mutual recrimination and hatreds over the fallout from a failed President and a failed administration. So, to recap-Trump is LincolnHarris is BreckenridgeKennedy is BellWe will see who takes the Douglas role at the convention. Because one Democratic faction gets the official nomination, and the other walks.

                The most crucial difference from 1860 is the Apparat, from  every three letter agency and their paramilitaries that didn’t exist in 1860, that have a say now. Those within the shadow state of the Federal departments and agencies, I think, are just as fragmented between the Democrat factions as the donor (foreign and domestic) class and the professional political class. That is going to complicate matters immensely, and with a week or so to to do it in, under absolute panic conditions.

                    The Inner Party factionalism has been on full display for some time now. I agree that if things pop off there would be no unified response. In fact, using my California scenario, some factions would be down with the breakaway, which kind of is your point, I imagine. Getting “Americans” to fight to put down a rebellion would be next to impossible. It wasn’t all that popular 160 years ago and this actually was a nation then.The 2020 election was fortified to prevent Calexit or whatever but my guess is there may no longer even be a unified Inner Party desire to keep things intact. The most bloodless and peaceful scenario, Blue America going its own way, conceivably may be possible now. The rest of the country is just as troubled, of course, largely due to demographics. I’m still in the nothing happens camp, though, until stomachs are empty and houses cold in the winter, but I’m far less in that camp than previously.

            With the strong string of endorsements it would appear the inner party is erecting a wall of protection around Harris, but I don’t see how that holds up if, going into the convention, her polling is so bad that it shows her losing states like Vermont or Washington.

        Biden is sick with COVID and hasn’t been seen. He might be in really bad shape. If he is sick with COVID they are not sitting there in his room helping him write the letter. Amadeus was just a movie. Anyway, this letter pops up days after Biden made is clear through his channels (social media) that he wasn’t resigning. it is on some default Word template and doesn’t have the official Presidential seal. Biden’s staff learned about it at the same time we did. Hillary Clinton is one of the first people to officially endorse Kamala. The entire party establishment, including the media, EXCEPT FOR OBAMA moves immediately to endorse her as well and everything pivots in milliseconds.Yea they locked Jill in her office, committed the coup, and that is that. The Obama faction just took a major L. The thing is, we’ve seen them operate for a long time at this point and we know they aren’t going to just take it quietly.

        I don’t think Biden needed too much convincing at all. He woke up in the morning (barely), after a night full of nightmares that did not make much sense to him: chaotic voices and visions of newspaper headlines telling him it’s time to go. After the staff changed his diapers and gave him a sponge bath to soften the smell came Jill. With a soothing voice she whispered: “Honey, it’s time”, handing him the letter. Joe, still confused and shaken, mumbled “OK”. He sat up in the bed, signed the letter and laid back down to try to get some more sleep and dream about running the world.

        We don’t even really know who the factions are, what hard lines divide them, what lines intersect … …People say Obama. But, Obama was conjured from a, “community organizer”, nearly overnight. We know he kindled BLM and is driven by his wife’s, his father’s and his own personal racial animus. I can tell you that growing up in Hawaii he lived in a place where voracious anti-White hatred and attitudes are par for the course – even in the 70s and 80s.In any case, 10/7 and the cracks in the clouds who built the coalition and the coalition members have radically changed things. Ukraine capitulation is coming, and that portends a lot of problems for the GAE and its weak position. Perhaps, Biden/Burisma and countless skeletons in the closet are too heavy of liabilities to have him in the limelight as that time bomb ticks toward Ka-Boom!As for 10/7 it will take time for the Noticing that was done by the people who are targets of the coalition to turn into even more serious problems for at least the most powerful faction of The Regime. That, for now, is a few years away from bubbling up.We just have to sit and wait. Use every day to get yourself into a stronger position than you were the day before. This is getting very wild. The Regime has been openly fighting the plebs since 2015. Now they take out their stooge in what is certainly a massive panic. The internecine warfare will shrink the power group and create one more set of enemies – this time those who know who is who.Popcorn please.

        This may be off topic, but has anyone else noticed that when Kamala Harris is delivering her turd of rhetoric concerning “The future, unburdened by the past” she very frequently uses hand gestures strongly reminiscent of the “As above, so below” of Baphomet and his acolytes?

        The one conspiracy nobody anywhere has theorized is that Harris engineered this. Nobody, not anybody, believes she is competent enough to do that. Yet supposedly they are all gaga for her as president. Right.The Clintons wouldn’t have immediately endorsed her if they didn’t approve of the coup, regardless if that endorsement is genuine. Obama, for the second time, by withholding endorsement suggests he was not on board with sacking Joe. (the first being “sometimes you have a bad debate”).Conclusion: I had been of the opinion that the nominee will be either Hillary or Big Mike. Either of whom would satisfy the requirement of making the steal plausible, which Harris IMO does not. Taking into account the above, I’m now leaning more Clinton.Imagine being in Russian or Chinese intel and having to explain this to Putin or Xi.

            TBH I don’t think Michelle Obama would take the job. She never seemed to be happy when BO was Prez – if memory serves, she even made comments to that effect to Carla Bruni (First Lady of France at the time), i.e. how she didn’t like living in the WH goldfish bowl. So I doubt she’d want to pile on the stress and hate for herself, when she’s glad to be out of the public eye. Just my $0.02.

            Imagine being in Russian or Chinese intel and having to explain this to Putin or Xi.
While obviously self-serving, Putin likely told Tucker Carlson the truth when he said he had no idea who is in charge of the United States.

            Right. We’ve been hearing stories for years that Harris’ office and inner circle, like her campaign, was in total disarray and second rate. There is no way they engineered and executed this. I don’t think Big Mike wants to be President and I doubt Obama wants to be “First Gentleman” (too effete, even for him).It’s gotta be Clinton.

The superficial jockeying of the servants competing for billets in the institutions of authority is unbelievable enough. Now throw in the jockeying behind the scenes of their owners/investors, and its a tangled web we weave. If this were happening in another country, what passes for geostrategic intelligence in AINO would never figure it out.

        “Plausibility” can be quantified, to a certain extent.I’ve always taken the term ‘conspiracy theory’ to mean a theory that, in order for it to be true, other global variables would need to be excited out of their ground state. For example, many conspiracy theories imply the existence of a hypercompetent government agency that has no public footprint and none of whose members ever break ranks. While such an entitymightexist, it would require an enormous amount of resources to maintain. The energy and money required for its existence could not be completely camouflaged; it would leave telltale traces in the environment pointing to the existence ofsomethingconsuming the resources. The First Law of Thermodynamics insists that the energy has to go somewhere, so where is it going?Just as Landauer’s Principle establishes the fact that information cannot be processed without a certain minimum increase in entropy, a similar (unnamed) principle could be cited in support of the notion that overly complex conspiracy theories would imply measurable social and economic effects that have not been observed. If someone had a mind to do so, they could possibly even define some rough equations describing this. Note that this principle does not say that conspiracy theories canneverbe true; it only says that, given the actual quantity of resources expended, there is a range of theories that are plausiblein the given instance.Theories falling outside of that range are physically impossible and hence not plausible as conspiracy theories.On the specific subject of Biden’s withdrawal, I just want to say that it is a dark day for the legal and constitutional stability of the country. If a president can be shoved aside like this, it is not good for anybody. We have a mechanism for the vesting and divesting of power, and for transferring it from one person to another, and this is not it. Biden had one last chance to do something useful for his country simply by remaining where he was, and seems he lacked either the willingness or the ability to do it. A very sad day indeed.

            It’s not really that complicated. There is a large complex of office buildings, full of people, in Langley, VA whose entire raison d’etre is to conspire. Anyone who talks is sent to prison for decades. Simple as. And yes, it does require an enormous amount of resources to maintain (which is not in dispute).

            Your theory about conspiracy theories is intelligent and not without merit. However, we’re pretty sure that in post-war America, that country had an entire agency devoted to black ops. This agency was not on the books in any way, and left no traces in the accounting, yet it existed. What I’m trying to say is that in the present something similar may well exist and we could be none the wiser because there are all sorts of very creative ways to cloak such an entity and to make sure its absorption of resources is utterly invisible. I not only think this can be done, I think it probably is being done.

            “For example, many conspiracy theories imply the existence of a hypercompetent government agency that has no public footprint and none of whose members ever break ranks.”Why do they need to be competent, let alone “hypercompetent.”  Most conspiracies aren’t especially complex, at least the ones we know about.The idea that conspiracies never hold is absolute nonsense.  If conspiracies are so hard to keep secret, why in god’s name does the US government classify like a million documents a year?  We have one of the most secretive governments in the world.  The only aspect that differentiates the mountains of classified documents from true conspiracies is the legality.  At its most basic level, a conspiracy is agreement between 2 or more people to break the rules.  They never need to be as vast as it is usually claimed by people who reflexively dismiss conspiracies.While I’m not one to go into conspiracies theories, mostly because the ones I know about (chemtrails, 911, little green men etc) are truly retarded, when they are revealed, it is never a surprise to me.  Like is it really a surprise to you that FBI agents framed 3 men for a murder they knew they didn’t commit because they liked hanging out undercover with the mob?You can never hate these people enough.  Whatever evil you think they are capable of, dial it up a few notches.  If they were caught sacrificing babies to Satan, I’d be like “I KNEW IT!!!! I knew they were up to no good!”

Here’s the thing. Every journalist in the Western world suddenly decided, simultaneously, that language wasn’t a thing anymore, than you died WITH corona rather than OF corona.
This tell you that 1) they knew the authorities were massaging the number and 2) they were perfectly fine with peddling fake news. Competent or not, that’s a lot of conspiracy right there, and that’s before we even count all the medical professionals.

                Demanding conscious direction in every detail ignores the headless nature of true believers and org charts, and of momentum.  Things in motion tend to stay in motion.
(Interesting. That view is right up there with the “One God” view that there must be a single Source consciously spinning every electron. Or for running the simulation, if you’re an infidel deserving of hellfire.)

Why? B resigns, B crime family gets pardoned, H becomes prez, they switch her out at the convention. Newsome becomes the prez candidate, KH becomes Governor or SCOTUS.

        Apparently the U.S. Congress is in the business of playing ‘Conspiracy Theory’ games — as per no less exalted a source than Wikipedia:
“The United States House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) was established in 1976 to investigate the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 and 1968, respectively. The HSCA completed its investigation in 1978 and issued its final report the following year, which concluded that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.”
