        With the exception of Clarence Thomas I think the entire Supreme Court is from outside Dixie.  The South is at the same time the most populous region and full of Evangelical Christians.  Any Evangelicals on the Court?   Nah.  Southern people still seem to long for, though quietly, a country that they can feel is their own.  Your article articulates very well some reasons for that.

        Over the past 7+ years I think RACISM!! has taken a fatal hit. It has jumped the shark. Racism is thrown at so many things and so randomly nowadays that it has lost all meaning and most of its approbation (at least out here in flyover country). I have come to accept, being old, white and male, that any opinion I have that is outside the coastal construct is to be considered racist. O.K., I’ll stipulate that and move on through the conversation. The same for the rest of the liberal catechism. It has all been exposed for its fascism and foolishness. The soft-handed, feminized, brown shirted yahoos can still cause some trouble for the country, but they have lost the war.

        This series feeds me at a soul level.  Excellent writing.  You are writing what I’ve been saying to others in conversation over several years, but you are saying it better and with more clarity.  Thank you for affirming I’m not alone in my observations and your added clarity and information helps fill out the parts that I thought I knew but we’re as buttressed as I’d like for debating/discussion with others.
Appreciate the series of what you know…. and the rest of the blog.  Wish you the best.

        Woodrow Wilson’s parents were copperheads from Ohio who moved south to Georgia. Little Woodrow grew up in Augusta, GA and actually remembered seeing Robert E. Lee on his last trip in 1869. But Wilson can hardly be considered “Southern” any more than can the son of a New York banker whose family happened to move to Atlanta before said son was born. Cultures don’t meld that quickly. Wilson was spiritually a Northerner before he ever left Virginia.

        What’s obvious depends on where you sit.  It’s obvious to uss’ms that this progressive show has jumped shark but not to “them”.  See the parade of Clinton, Sanders, Obama, NYT, LAT, et. al. pushing for more gun control after this last shooting.   And so it goes.

        “…has forever stained the soul of every southerner and every conservative.”Nah, just the outermost layer of clothing. Oddly, this somehow now includesall white, male, heterosexuals, of mere STEM course of study, in the “New England” college “sphere of influence”..(*ahem*) Or so it would seem.Entryism, or something.

        920 words and you never once used the word “White.”
Maybe thats the problem?
The system of White supremacy was refined to such great purity that it confused White people?

        […] bring up this incident as a bit of a follow up to my post the other day on the weaponization of race by the left side of the ruling coalition. Peter Brimelow and the people that appear on his site […]
