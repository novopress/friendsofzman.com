        “The ugliness of the ’70s” – yeah, those high school girls sure were ugly back then – slender, no tattoos, no facial piercings, and no blue hair – ugly, all right….

        Impossible for me to describe growing up in Fifties America to the young cohort.  Literally I am describing an alien world.
We spent all day outside as kids, in exhilarating physical exertion and athletics.  My dad cut me loose at 12 or 13.  Don’t get arrested and don’t get girls pregnant.  That was it.
Now most children never grow up.  UC and UMC kids are bubble-wrapped by gynocentric cultures and governments.  Freedom and self-reliance are horrors to be avoided at all costs.  My world is a prison to them, and their world is a prison to me.

            “My world is a prison to them, and their world is a prison to me.”
Their world is prison to them, whether they knotrivialities.
The entire entertainment complex was always meant to be brainwashing and propoganda at worst.  At best it was made to hawk products and waste people’s time by sucking then into unreal trivialitily.  It’s all idolatry.
I’m also sure that the kids you tried to explain the 50s to cannot comprehend not having to deal with the tension of the 50,000 different racial and religious groups now in the US.

                If the government tried to pull the stuff it does now when I was a kid, my dad, grandpa, and their friends would have burnt the town — and the punks — to the ground.  With govt. officials and LE the first to go.  Then they would have gathered at the golf course clubhouse they built to drink beer, play gin, and laugh.  These were men hardened by the Depression and by wars.Now the nation is ruled by women, and masculinity has been under full-on attack since the Seventies.  The men required to stand against totalitarianism and thuggery are few and far between.  The enemies of the nation, foreign and domestic, know this.  They are the ones that engineered it, after all.

        Glad Z mentioned Richard Hanania. He has a new grift. He has been full bore on team Ukraine and now has stepped up his game. Recently, he wrote about how the right is wrong to have such a negative view of the press. Except for woke issues, the press are really dedicated journalists who are committed to the truth. Sure!While Hanania was working to get the right to embrace journalists, a more senior grifter, Cernovich, was telling his followers that athletes getting heart problems is not new and no big deal.I am sure that the synchronicity was a complete coincidence. Otherwise, I might be led to believe that the rulers are worried that too much noticing is going on and people need to learn the errors of their ways.Hardly anyone seemed to be buying Hanania or Cernovich’s new grifts. Maybe their handlers want this new direction or maybe they are just buying some protection for themselves by letting the rulers know that they can be bought and are no real threat.

        I few weeks ago I was parking my truck in a underground parking structure located in west LA to meet with the head engineer of facilities, I could have sworn I saw nick Fuentes getting into an elevator. The building was mostly populated with skincare and plastic surgery practices. E1 had no idea who I was pointing at. Thank goodness.

        Ridiculously OT
Leaving the Dr office, and if I don’t type this now, I’ll forget before I get out of the parking lot.
The people on this comment section are some pretty sharp cookies. That said, when high end Indian (Brahmins) like Drs etc, interact with whitey, do they perceive us as untouchables?
I got that distinct vibe today.
Any insights would be appreciated.

            It’s hard to say if it’s that or just that Indians always regard their official job description as peripheral to the real task of milking the system. You see this with the techies. It’s not that they’re too stupid to understand code but that they seem to regard the actual coding as being somebody else’s problem. Translated into the medical field I suppose this could mean viewing physical contact with patients as somehow outside their “real job”, whatever it is they imagine that to be.One could speculate that such an attitude might account for the low level of development the British observed when they first moved into the subcontinent. Lots of smart people with a high culture but when it comes to interacting with the physical as opposed to the metaphysical, everyone just kicks the can down the caste hierarchy. Eventually, you get to the untouchable guy but who wants to go down to his nasty little village to see if he actually did the work anyway?

            Honestly–and this won’t be popular–my interactions with Indians of all castes have been positive. Doctors, restauranteurs, scholars, students, grocers–they’ve almost all been quite friendly. And the girls gaze with big round eyes and coy smiles.

            Used to be 3 Sikhs in engineering where I work, only 1 now. Don’t know the difference between them and Hindus, but they were/are all pretty decent. Worst I can say is there seemed to be an assumption that I must be stupid because I work on the floor, but when I argued my position that usually went away. One was actually VP of Ops, or something. Found him reasonable and easy to work for. Got into it with him about masks, asked if I was going to have to quit over it. He said his wife is a doctor, he knew masks were BS, and we compromised. Still, always an air of superiority from them in my experience, whether from position in the company or otherwise I’m not sure.

            From past experience around the manosphere one thing that was noteworthy was that Indian men lusted after white women to a degree that would make a Ferengi cringe, and resented that those white women preferred tall white men (or failing that a tall black man).
It’s actually a great example of how the browns will always resent and hate the whites: as Americans we never did anything to Indian-Americans, they came here of their own volition, and have a higher standard of living than whites on average.

        I read the article from the ex-youtube bimbette.  Let’s face it, she wasn’t doing that crap online without her parent’s support and authorization.  And just like often exploited childhood actors through the years, they were hoping to (and probably did) cash in on her popularity.  The thing with tv/movie acting is that the possibilities were relatively limited.  Now, practically anyone can attempt to cash in online with their often worthless opinions and/or antics.  If the internet went down for good tomorrow, a rather large segment of the population would seriously freak out and have no idea what to do or how to live their lives going forward.  There are a lot of good things with respect to the net and online stuff, but there is also a very dark side, even in the common place areas.

                This NATO tweet shows the mentality and level of maturity of the people in charge. Which is quite low. Taking pop culture and a bloody conflict to make a amalgamation of a Hollywood production is pathetic.

            Whether or not the regime chooses to propagate or suppress the message in this tweet will tell us a lot. Could tell us everything, depending. So far it looks like suppress. Like they are going to pretend it didn’t happen.

        Not only did it have these social impacts, but it has had major economic and quality of life impacts.  My phone rings all day long with scam calls.  The caller ID doesn’t help because they spoof the caller ID. Our elderly are being targeted by Indian scammers.  People lose hundreds of thousands of Dollars to this criminality.  It has gotten to the point where if my bank wants to speak to me about something, I just hang up on them and then call my  bank.  There is even a genre on youtube of people uploading videos of themselves messing with Indian scammers.If I ever need to speak to a representative of a company I end up on the phone with a pajeet calling xirself some typical White American name (but never Tamika or DeShawn) speaking with a thick accent.  The internet has made it possible to import low wages virtually.Then there’s the aspect of people walking around looking at their phones. The total lack of privacy. Cameras recording everything we do. Phones that spy on us with the microphone and camera that no longer requires a light be lit when active.We have put critical infrastructure on the publicly accessible internet.  Dumb luck kept a Florida water treatment facility from sending poisoned water into the municipal water supply after being hacked. Sooner or later the hackers are going to have a major success and crash a regional grid or send out poisoned water in a major city.  Now they want to put cars on this same insecure system with self driving capabilities.Like everything else we do, we refuse to look at the costs and see only the benefits.

        All of this has been studied via societal modeling (the studies are ongoing) and the results are not good. The net effect is a destruction of ancestral robustness as a result of isolation from a natural environment where fitness is both challenged and refined. There is no tangible “fitness” derived from virtual reality and you cannot exercise your immune system through cognitive activities. Which means we are becoming much more fragile in body as well as in mind. Modern affluence allows a large cohort of people to pretend to be productive by “working from home” and massaging data ad infinitum, with endless zoom meeting thrown in. Does this grow crops, build refrigerators, or repair you auto? NO, it does not. And what happens when the plates stop spinning, you’ve gone 3 days without a meal, and you’re not even competent to change a tire? Yeah, we will likely have a 3 century collapse like the Romans, not.

Interesting observation.  For those that doubt this, one need only look to such occurrences in human evolution.  Neanderthals had a larger brain that Sapiens, and Sapiens are much more “graciated” in phenotype than Neanderthals.  Read about the ancient Roman legionnaires and their gear weight and daily marching distance.  We really are a society of Pillsbury Dough boys.  🙁

        I’m absolutely convinced that had the “elites” who own our society known that they internet would have become, we would all be accessing it right now with pre coded key cards that fit into some card reader like DirectTV.  They thought, in their early 90’s “End of History” hubris that their ideas had won, when in fact, they just enjoyed a monopoly on info-tainment.  In their last desperate years, which are coming, they will indeed be cracking down on all of us in a way that made Twitter bans for anti-vax posing look like nothing.  Society actually has a chance for free thought with the internet.  The fact that 90% of society is incapable of free thought is beside the point.  It’s the 10% of free thinkers that matter, and they have been forever liberated by this technology.   Do you think Bill Gates, in hindsight, is happy about the internet?  He made his billions selling overpriced disks in the pre-internet era.  I’m sure he was ecstatic at the beginning, but now that he’s called out as some vax crazy Epstein pedo, I’m sure he would want this sucker locked down like a drum tomorrow.   Same thing with old cockroach politicians like Anus King, ME Senator.  Look what he tried to pull more recently.And you know what else?  The crazy woman posting on Tiktoc is a thousand times funnier than clunky old sitcoms like Mad About You.  Look at what we had to watch back then.  As dated and sad as some hundred year old Vaudeville act in the Catskills.

            While some of that comparison may be biased by changing standards of humor (people in say 2000 found 1940s radio humor flat) your point stands.  The entertainment complex was previously largely in the hands of a select few who were mostly rather mediocre.  Case in point Hollywood is now crumbling, despite large budgets and the backing of left media.

        I haven’t been on Taki since November… finally caught up on the z man articles, so I figured I would check it out.
They have an article by someone named Rugy calling for a massive increase in immigration, including low-skilled immigration. She is literally calling for a great replacement, except bigger and better than what has happened in the last 60 years.
What the hell is going on over at that site these days?? I saw they also added Stephen Moore?I wish they still had a comment section to see the reaction to the Rugy article.

            Taki used to have a lively comment section but took it down a few years ago. This seems to be the trend for most sites. Can’t have the proles talking back to the anointed ones apparently.

                In light defense, as I liked reading the Taki comments (never commented there myself), it wasn’t unusual for a throwaway article by Jim Goad to get +1000 comments and if what was left had even been lightly moderated it was probably getting to the point that someone had to babysit those comments fulltime.  With a feature that popular they should have commercialized it like Unz or Zerohedge, but I don’t think that capability is built into Discus.

            Taki’s went into the dumpster fast, when Taki wiped out the excellent comment section . . . which was the meat of the site.Reason went unstated, but it was obvious that Taki’s princess daughter — who ran and ‘edited’ the place — grew increasingly uncomfy with the anti-feminist and anti-gynocracy nature of many comments.The solution, as always with our Gender Superiors, was censorship or, in this case, silencing of all dissent.  So much for ‘conservative’ zillionaires.  Cucks just like the rest.As with Donald Trump, Taki could not keep his princess daughter from destroying the house.  So it goes.

        One of the biggest advantages of social media for the craven individuals is the freedom to insult and call out those with whom they disagree or hate. Theses are the type who would never do that face to face for fear of physical reprisal but the internet gives them the safety of doing it at a distance. Basically chickenshits with opinions.  If it ever becomes possible to punch someone in the mouth online then this behavior will diminish.There’s always the hope a new invention will have overwhelming positive effects. For example, the first powered airplane flight happened in 1903. In a little more than ten years we were using them to kill those with whom we disagreed or hated. People of the time probably saw only the positive aspects and never thought of using them in war. Most people anyway.

        This is so spot-on.  My family does some homesteading and as part of that watch a number of homesteading youtube channels.  Some friends of ours gave us tickets to a homesteading convention where we met one of the people we follow, Justin Rhodes.  His online persona is all about work and family, engaging people.  In person he was so awkard that he couldn’t even look you in the eyes.Now I already had a health suspicion of those who promote themselves on social media.  But this seemed something bigger, not merely grifting or inflating ones ego.  They might have started out somewhat normal or not; regardless in the process of time their own minds and conception of reality is distorted.

        A minor point, to be sure, but this “Keev” idiocy is maddening, not just because it is pretentious, but because it is technically wrong. The Ukraine’s capital is not a one-syllable word. Yes, the stress is on the first syllable, but there is a second syllable. Kiev is a perfectly accurate transposition of the city’s pronunciation.

            Agreed.  We also pronounce things as they translate to our language, (e.g., we say France and not Fronsay).  I recall when the media were falling all over themselves to pronounce Qatar as cutter or even gutter.

                I had a good friend from Britain, spoke with very old-school RP but he seemed to get a kick out my nasally Great Lakes accent.  Anyway, he told me that as a child he could never figure out why the Yanks would use the couplet “The King of France wet his pants,” because the two words didn’t rhyme.This also brings to mind a World Series broadcast several years ago when Joe Buck was discussing the pitcher Chien-ming Wang.  He started lecturing viewers about how to pronounce his last name.  You see, you corn-shucking rubes, despite the spelling it’s pronounced “Wong”.  To punctuate his lecture he used the scripted line, “Wong is right.”  Problem is that in Wang’s Taiwan, his name is pronounced more like “Wahng”.  But he and the network made this whole thing up just so they could sound smart.

                    I used to have fun with that back in the days. Covering WWII in Asia, I’d say “We’re going to refer to the leader of the Allied Chinese as ‘Chiang Kai-Shek,’ not ‘Jiang Jieshi.’ For one, he called *himself* ‘Chiang Kai-Shek,’ and people who spoke both English and Chinese, like his main American adviser Gen. Stillwell, called him ‘Chiang Kai-shek,’ so it’s period-appropriate. Second, ‘Chiang Kai-shek’ is no better or worse than ‘Jiang Jeishi,’ since neither of them include the tones and those are the only thing that matter in any case.”I started getting grief on this from White kids, but not from Chinese speakers — they appreciated it.

                        Don’t get me started on the way media types pronounce Beijing, with that “zhhhing” sounding second syllable.  Unlike some other Chinese phonemes, “jing” is actually Romanized in a way that English speakers should nail at first glance.  But the smart set can’t help signaling that there’s a hidden trick in there that only they have figured out.  I’d rather they go back to saying Peking.

            Yes, I agree about the weird pronunciations. My mother and grandmother fled the Bolsheviks thru Manchuria into China. My mom went to (gymnasium) high school there and then to California for college. Her older sister went to music conservatory and taught piano for many years in Oregon and Nevada. I have cousins out that way I’ve never met. Anyway, my grandfather was from Kharkov, Ukraine, went to the university there. I never met him as he had been arrested by the Bolsheviks and imprisoned in Siberia where he died after a year. Mother used to say that he called Ukraine “Small Russia”; he was a large-animal veterinarian and had a field station in Chita, Siberia. He was decorated for his achievements in medicine, protecting the cattle with inspections and vaccinations for the Russian Army food supply during WWI; the Mongolian government “knighted” him for his work helping the various tribal peoples and their herds which they relied on for food and sustenance. I grew up hearing Russian spoken in the house until my Babushka died when I was 8, and learned the alphabet and some grammar in Russian history and language college courses. To me the Ukrainian that we are hearing today, like Keev and Ihor (man’s name) are a down-market form of Russian, sort of like Noo Choysy (New Jersey) lingo. It appears that the same Cyrillic alphabet and written Russian words are used, but are pronounced differently. My mother would have used a slur to describe Zelensky!

            Politically correct pronunciation can be a life or death matter.
“Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.”

        “…but the internet has changed society. In fact, it has changed people by changing the selection pressures within society.”Perhaps one of the biggest changes, which you alluded to, is the Internet—and by Internet we really are talking software applications that run upon it—has had a detrimental impact on attention span.  I find this even in myself.Too much information, too little time to spend on any one source.  Skim, then on to the next one.  Compare this to an in depth course of study and concentration in any field of study found in a typical graduate college level course.  I remember long hours of reading mathematical treatments and working problems by hand in graduate school.  A problem taking several hours to complete was not uncommon.  Only then, would I be allowed a calculator or computer to solve future problems of this sort.Not much different in the non-mathematical subject areas.  Take an advanced textbook in genetics or evolution.  You need to read and concentrate for hours on end.  Five minute explanations get you little understanding—but perhaps a reputation in your local Internet comment section.  🙁

        Twenty years ago I could have made the argument that it would be the “old” people that would take to virtual reality whereas the young people would be living life in the real world like we did 1980-2000. Old people lack the energy and stamina, not to mention physical attractiveness, to be out wind surfing during the day and hitting the night clubs in the evening. The fantasies of virtual reality are certainly more enjoyable than the reality of living in an aging, fucked-up body.
But it never turned out this way.

        “They prefer life on-line to life outside. They have grown up with the chat room as their playground. Instead of playing games with their friends in the physical realm, they played games on-line. Their peer group was the collection of avatars and personalities in the chat.”This is utterly depressing to contemplate. Youthful physical reality in the 80’s and 90’s, particularly in the sun belt and Southeast Asia, was much more fun and fulfilling than virtual reality of any kind.“The West may be forced to choose between the glories of diversity or the virtual public square. The answer may be a segregated internet in order to keep the peace.”This is overstated. That these kids spend all their time on-line means they lack the skills to be effective in the real, both for positive as well as negative intent. Given that these people prefer virtual to real world suggests the problem is self-solving.

            Maybe there is some hope. Zuckerberg’s VR Meta looks like a spectacular failure. Given the chance to go full on virtual world, young people gave it a pass.
Then again, maybe not. That generation seems to be unable to interface with other people in real time…with all the messiness and social gaffes that can entail.
Social media today is all about composing the perfect frame, the perfect picture, the perfect rejoinder, joke or insult. It’s as “risk free” as interactions with other people will ever get.
It also is incredibly limiting.

                The problem with meta isn’t the concept, it’s that the product isn’t good enough. Someday, it will be good enough. When physical sensation is part of the experience. I doubt I live long enough to see that.

                What Zuckerberg’s peddling already exists and has been very popular for about a decade: VRChat. (And before that, there were others.) The “market” for the Zuccerverse is people who don’t use VRChat because it’s not censored enough.That’s literally nobody, so as the Zuccerverse has failed, there’s been a coordinated media campaign top paint VRChat as a “virtual strip club,” “e-brothel,” secret racist social club, etc. In response to this, VRChat of course immediately trust-and-safetied itself half to death—as purely profit-motivated libertarian corporations do.But it wasn’t enough. That weirdly highly publicized girl who was recently denied a US visa for being a prostitute—has that ever happened before?—wasn’t a prostitute but a VRChat geisha doing “GFE” for dorks. There’s a memo floating through the halls of law enforcement with VRChat’s name on it, singling out its users for special attention.The Zuccerverse will be state-mandated.

            “The solitary nature of on-line life removes the social signals that people rely upon to figure out what they can say and what they should not say. When you are on-line, you are by yourself in the physical realm, even though you are interacting with others in the virtual realm. Those people, however, are mere avatars of people.”Another great article Z. How do you do this every day?The younger generations are so deformed by virtual reality that they can’t even talk on the phone. My daughter just made a dental appointment on the phone, and the dental assistant was amazed by her confident, clear and precise phone capabilities that cut to the chase and helped the assistant quickly do her job, something most of us oldsters take for granted.Hey folks….a new way to make a few bucks capitalizing on their inadequacies. This link is to a tutor charging big bucks to teach Gen Z folks how to talk on the phone. Holy shite!https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-charges-480-hour-gen-z-workers-overcome-phone-fear-2022-12

        “Those people, however, are mere avatars of people.” – TV was the first visual social experience and had a 50 year head start.  It made for sameness.  Everyone buying the same products from the same commercials. and political opinions carefully crafted by (((big media))) and (((Hollywood))) screen writers.  The internet inverts all of this, making the avatar his or her own screen writer.So we have an older crowd who had their information presented to them by some 1970’s jewess like Barbara Walters and today’s group that’s having their information presented to them by Tim Pool.   As awful as Tim Pool is, with his Alaska deep sea crab fisherman act, he’s ephemeral, he’ll never be some totem that people go to for decades for information.   He’s just another grain of sand on the beach.  No one will remember would he was in five years.  That’s the great thing about the internet.  The information consumer is already on to the next flash in the pan before that person can become some Henry Kissinger like revered media figure.  You can no longer grift for 70 years like a Buckley.  It becomes hand to mouth as it always should have been.

Haven’t had a chance to fact check… but my favourite‘personality’ that I live to hate is Scott Adams. Apparently he’s just been red pilled on blacks.
If true… this is big, in so many ways. The jews have been spectacularly successful undermining the mass media, and claim to have done so with the social media as well…but if you’re seeing guys like Adams getting red pilled on judeoliberal sacred cows… it speaks well indeed of the digital age…

            Assuming he’s not “grifting”.  That is to say, he’s truly red pilled rather than sensing which way the wind is blowing and turning to catch the latest wave of sentiment for viewership, clicks, and what have you.

        “These people front-run trends in order to present themselves as trendsetters.”One of the worst front-runners, in both digital and analog formats, is that Jim Cramer clown on CNBC.  He will praise or bash a stock after it has already moved, and convince people he had predicted it all along.  I recall when Apple was down several years ago, he did his sell/sell/sell schtick, saying they just sold cell phones and had nowhere to go but down.  A year or two later, the stock took off, and he was talking up how innovative they were, and it was buy/buy/buy.  If just listened to him, you would think he was a great analyst.  If you bought and sold when he told you to, you lost your shirt.If you look at his background, he admits as a hedge fund manager he would short-sell stocks and then trash them in public.  This is of course illegal, but he is one of the cloud people, so he got away with it.

            Virtually every stock market “analyst” or commentator is emotion driven. If you waste time watching CNBC you’ll see their moods, and their “analysis,” correlate to whether the market is up or down. The most difficult thing about investing is overcoming emotion. Easy to say. Virtually impossible to do. Even the all time greats have to battle it. If you can overcome your emotions just a majority of the time you’re ahead of the game.

        Humans weren’t “meant” to all get along together in the same cyberspace anymore than they were all meant to get along together in the same geographical space. But this does not automatically lead to segregation. The current purpose that the internet serves of supplying the “two minutes hate” could hypothetically go on forever. I’ve no doubt that the regime prefers us plugged into our devices.I must do a pretty good job of firewalling my own internet since this is the first time I’ve heard of Richard Hanania or Lex Fridman. There are a lot of very popular things and people that I’m clueless about, because I’m uninterested in clown world and segregate myself merely by not looking at it. Even so, it gets through. In my home page news feed, for no good reason I can discern, stories of the most absurd degeneracy regularly appear. It occurred to me to save the links for posterity. Here are just a couple of examples. I see this stuff every week. I guess this is how they normalize it.https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/parenting/my-wife-is-bisexual-and-nonbinary-and-my-daughter-is-transgender-my-queer-family-helped-me-better-understand-myself-and-my-masculinity/ar-AA17rCCF?ocid=msedgntp&amp;cvid=a01f72a4eeb64226a3ffd4d6e23ecdfehttps://www.msn.com/en-us/health/wellness/how-i-became-a-professional-dominatrix/ar-AA15PMvo

            Obviously, I live in a bubble.  I’ve not been exposed to your URL’s, but do get Peterson and Pool and Adams.I assume Peterson video’s is a grift of sort—not Peterson, I like him—but the video clips (all excerpts) of his former talks and presentations, some quite old, and many under different channel names.  Pool on the other hand is old hat, and never seems to be to the point.  There must be some monetary deal because he always takes 15+ minutes to discuss a 60 second topic. Scott Adams, the same.  Never saw a video less than 30 minutes from him.  Scott would be fine as an Uncle talking at the dinner table.

                His daughter doesn’t really walk his talk, so that makes me wonder.  I question all of the youtube personalities.  The alpha shit and sigma shit, and cleaning your room.  Youtube is owned by google who was probably created by the CIA.  Take it all with a grain of salt.  Remember when the church made it a crime to jack off because it was important for people to reproduce so the king or lord would have a larger army then his peers?  Now turn that on its head, not enough resources to go around, those at the top are aware of it, so they promote (yes they are promoting it, compared to when i was a kid) being a homo.  A non violent way to get people to not reproduce (essentially a way to enjoy your slavery by thinking you’re making the choice).

        Firstly, another example of a “conservative” internet “star” that makes no sense is Jeremy of the Quartering. This guy has over a million subscribers, and he’s dumb as a goldfish. He literally just reads articles and adds very little insight or original commentary. Plus, he often uses the clickbait/intentionally misleading video titles. I don’t know why, but his popularity insults me more than any other conservative.

            I didn’t know who this person was until Matt Walsh showed clips of him yesterday.  The first thing I notice about him is that he’s got the requisite shelf full of children’s toys behind him.  Video games, Star Wars, etc.  He’s trying to signal to the left that he’s just as innocent and fun-loving as they imagine themselves to be.
What is it going to take for people to put away their toys and act like, and present themselves as adults?

                    He’s in one of the primary demographic groups of youtube grifting: the older millennials (35-40 years old now) who didn’t get fully sucked into woke, but still never got their lives together.  They can’t interact with younger people because not being woke means they have old man foot-in-mouth disease, but older people don’t have any respect for them for being video game obsessed losers.  Youtubers suck them in with nostalgia for their youth which is primarily focused on the Super Nintendo that dominated their childhoods.  Think about why in God’s name anyone would want to watch a speedrun or lore analysis of Final Fantasy 6.Gamergate was driven by the same demo: newly minted middle-aged men upset that the young kiddies don’t like the same stuff as them.

        It makes sense. Agrarian society produced rugged individualists. Industrial society produced rough worker bees. Financialized society produced the boomer. Virtual society produces nerds.
Z’s got a very interesting idea. The lack of social skills and cohesion could lead to segregation, like it did in the first place. Coming full circle. Funny how the virtual could burst the bubble.

        We may end up with small, highly religious communities, with high birth rates, that sharply limit internet usage, especially among the young. Birth rates in the general population are so low that’s where we’re trending. Incels don’t reproduce. Today only something like 50% of young women will bear children, compared to maybe 90% in the 1950s.

        Mrs. W and I now have had the amusing experience many times on vacation of watching young newlywed honeymooners at dinner at nearby tables. They are playing with their smartphones and not talking to each other for long stretches of candlelit dinners. And these are the married ones! The single ones are at home doing God-knows-what.
Can you all imagine doing this on your honeymoon? Mrs. W will say: “they cannot possibly last!”. But who knows? Maybe the secret to marriage nowadays is ignoring your spouse and watching scantily-clad influencers on TikTok.

        My father is a big technophile who always made sure to have the latest computer in the house when I was growing up. I still remember us having a Commodore 64 in the 1980s. By my teenage years in the 90s, we had the full set-up of AOL to ‘surf’ the latest new thing out called the World Wide Web. I marveled at the ability to have access to the vast amounts of knowledge and literature that was available online. Being naively optimistic, I imagined that this new technology was a paradigm shift for the advancement of human progress.Boy was I wrong.

            You weren’t completely wrong. That knowledge is still there for curious minds. For example, someone that’s in the trades and handy with tools can now easily venture out and do numerous other handy projects by simply watching YouTube videos. If you’re a carpenter, you can easily learn how to do basic plumbing, electrical, drywall, etc. I’ve fixed household appliances as well.The problem is that we over estimated how many people are intellectually curious people. The masses largely want mindless entertainment and surface level engagement on politics at best. Hence the popularity of tic toc. However, those with curiosity have swaths of information at their fingertips.

We shouldn’t have. Before the internet every town or city spent thousands or millions of dollars building, maintaining, and staffing public libraries, but how many people actually went in and used them to research, learn, or inform?

                        I wouldn’t look so much at total patronage counts… But rather borrowing counts and type of items borrowed. I would venture to say that patronage (both card/non-card holders) has likely increased, as public libraries continue to increasingly offer more than access to books. In way too many locales, libraries are mostly daycare for street people/loser drug addicts who’ve worn out their welcome with personal contacts and shelters.Most of what patrons check out are:1. Children’s “easy-reader” books2. Hot bestseller garbage fiction3. Hypercontemporary pop-sci B.S.4. DVD’sThe normie library patron really sucks, quite frankly. You do get people who come in who have used the resources and material to enrich themselves… But they’re above average people, and rare even in non-vibrant/decaying communities.t.

                Yep, the tradesmen videos are in the whole, great.  As to your example, I am now undertaking setting up an EV charging station at my house.  Without the videos I’ve watched, I’d never have attempted to open my home electrical panel and begin the necessary wiring, nor would I have even thought about the power requirements and the concept of commercial grade components.  Pictures of melted receptacles does wonders.  😉

                There’s a joke that asks: what would be the most difficult thing to explain to someone from 50 years ago?  Answer: that we have all knowledge ever written on a device we hold in our hand, and we use it to argue with strangers and watch cat videos.
As for myself, I recently repaired my washing machine with a $29 water inlet sensor valve thanks to YouTube.

That ability of the internet is still great. Being able to access resources on how to fix, build, or learn a task is nice.

            ArthurinCali:  In many ways our experience was the polar opposite.  I used a number of early word processing programs and platforms in the late ’70s and early ’80s and was comfortable with them, but overseas we were limited to typewriters for security purposes.   When we returned to the US in the early ’90s, everyone was talking about something called ‘Windows’ and we had no idea what that was.We got our first computer for firstborn in 1998, so he could use Storybook Weaver.  Then followed various and sundry logical, historical, and educational programs.  My first political reading online was Michelle Malkin’s Hot Air in ’06.Never got involved in social media.  I have heard of some of those people Zman mentions, but never watched any of them.  I control my time and my intake of informational content.   Yes, my kids are far more online than I am, but as comfortable as they are with tech, they have real life friends and occupations.  I still use the internet primarily for knowledge and information, and regard it as a tool.  Whether this is because I’m old or because I’m contumacious or both, you decide.

                I pride myself on my knowledge of words and spellings, but I have not come across “contumacious” before.  I see myself becoming more and more contumacious as this country slips further and further away from the one I grew up in.
As to your point, I agree the internet is simply a tool, no more responsible for the grifters and perverts that abuse it than a hammer is for someone who hits himself in the head.

            You sound like me, right down the C-64.
One thing those of us from that generation have to ensure is that our children do not fall into the smartphone trap. Not until they’re 18+ and can pay for it themselves. I don’t think there’s any “safe exposure level” for these things to developing teenage brains (especially the girls). I’m not even sure they can handle it at 18, but legally you can’t stop them then.
The internet’s a nice (?) place to visit, but a horrible place to live.

The other day he called the Ohio disaster a “local train derailment” acting as if it was merely lumber and baling wire that was on those railroad cars instead of toxic chemicals polluting the Ohio river. The guy is a joke. He obviously is being pushed by unseen backers onto the public.

            Hanania talks about race realism doesn’t he? Or something like human biodiversity. He also talks about men and women being different. So I guess that’s why there’s some authentic interest in him.
He may be a libertarian who is for open borders. I’m not sure.  He also does some trolling and will say things to deliberately get both liberals and conservatives riled up.

        Somehow I never received the Lex Fridman promotion on my YouTube feed, but I did get another example of it. The Daily Wire (the Ben Shapiro folks) decided they needed a personality to reach da yutes, so they auditioned and basically created Brett Cooper. She’s a product, an actress hired for the role. She has a nice, fresh-scrubbed, girl next door look to her*, pretty but not overly sexualized, and she literally just does an “I’m a cute young chick” version of exactly the same topics on the same day being done by their “adult” hosts, and they pushed her from 0 to nearly 2 million subscribers within about a year.* The joke is that she looks like a female Ben Shapiro and once you see it, you can’t unsee it.

                There are endocrinological disorders wherein XY-chromosomed fetuses develop only female features, and grow up to believe that they are simply infertile women, but only genetic testing can prove that they actually have a Y-chromosome.The olympic track athlete, Caster Semenya, suffered from one such disorder.Just off the top of my head, the occurrences of these disorders are on the order of 1-in-10,000 [or maybe 1-in-100,000?] of all ostensible females.But lately I’ve been wondering whether, in the j00ish community, it might be a whole lot more like 1-in-1000 [or maybe even 1-in-100].If a statistically significant percentage of all ostensible j00esses were in fact actually j00z, then that would go a long long way towards explaining an whole helluva lotta what we see in Klownworld &amp; the GAE.

        A bit of an eye opener for Matt Walsh this week when the so called conservative grifters took him on for being too mean to that creep tranny(any other kind?) Dylan Mulvaney.Kind of like thinking National Review is really conservative until go time comes and they build their case for surrender and slither back. The two conservative fakes from Triggernometry even slyly suggested Matt might be ‘too into Dylan” .All of them are like this when the time comes to act and fight and we then realize they never were in this for any reason other than grift and popularity. Jordan Peterson is magnitudes worse on all levels.  Just follow his timeline jumping out in front of all these parades to lead.

                Has Jordan Peterson said anything that leads you to believe he’s emulating Roger Scruton? Scruton was far too sophisticated to peddle something as banal as self-help. Of course, Peterson’s self-help is cloaked in such gratuitous and excessive verbiage that it’s hard to blame normies for falling for it.
I generally refrain from speculating about the motives of people I don’t know personally. While it’s possible Peterson is a straight-up grifter, my suspicion is that he’s an articulate lost soul speaking to other lost souls. Blind leading the blind.

            The whole game was always to get conservatives to treat crazy leftists with respect. They could disagree but as long as they were respectful, that gave liberals the validation they needed.
So I think Matt Walsh has the right approach. We wouldn’t treat Charles Manson like he’s some deep thinker and engage his ideas. So why be so respectful to a transsexual who’s pushing an agenda that will hurt children.

                Something tells me Walsh is sincere. At some point he will have enough money to get off the reservation and build his own. I’ve seen him confronted with the question in public and it knocked him back. I hope I am right about him. As things unravel, we’ll need defectors with an audience and he remains a possibility.

                    Exactly my take on Matt. I think eventually he will have to make a choice and move on. No way is there a certainty it won’t be money over principles, even the best of us are weakened. Pray for him.

            To his credit, Walsh doubled down.  He distills the tranny issue down to its easily-understood essence.  These freaks and their supporters are openly attacking his children, his flesh and blood, and the time to throttle them is now.  That’s non-negotiable.  He basically made the point that’s been made many times on this site — victory comes first, pieties wait until after your opponents surrender.

        I don’t think you’ll see the Chinese fare any better with this younger generation.  In fact, I suggest the lack of diversity makes them even more robotic and detached from reality.  If you’ve been to the Far East you’ll witness youth addicted to screen time at a level that surpasses anything seen here.  Stop in a McDonalds and you’re confronted with an eerie silence despite being surrounded by other humans.  What you’ll see is a dozen or so teens completely unaware of their surroundings, moving only their thumbs.  A half hour will go by and they won’t change their posture in the slightest, nor look up from their device even once.I’m not pimping for diversity, but at least our kids get a daily reminder that differences among humans do exist.

            KGB:  Saw this in Asia in 1990.  Everyone had a cellphone (not us, of course – husband may have had a pager) and everyone was always on it.  They might live in a shoebox apartment, but they had the latest and most expensive phone models at the time.  Huge status symbol and part of the whole kiasu mentality.

                I saw a massive change in one year.  In 1996 I spent time in Korea and cell phones were still a novelty.  Just 12 months later I began a year-long stay in Taiwan and at least 90% of the people had cell phones.  It took the States a few more years to reach usage at that level.

            Z’s quip reminds me of the conservative hand wringing many years ago when the Chinese government would crack down on Internet parlors.  It was framed as a fight over freedom of speech, but any slight investigation revealed that these were just seedy places where young people were literally gaming themselves to death.

        I was one of those naive dreamers who once imagined that the Internet might offer us some kind of salvation from many of the ills of civilization. It’s become all too obvious, however, that the forever-online phenomenon among younger folks is producing a generation of perfect pod people. They’re no longer quite “human” in the way that term was traditionally understood. They’re turning into bug men.Funny thing about Mike Cernovich — he’s an honest-to-goodness lawyer. It’s hard to believe he passed the bar exam. I guess grifting online is now easier and more profitable than doing it in a courtroom.

        I’m a bit puzzled on this one. I flowed you until the very end. I disagree that we need a segregated internet.Real power of separation comes when we are able to pick and chose when to live in the digital world and when not to.  Leave the full time residents to their own devices.If you tune out of social media and use the handy stuff, you are essentially segregated from the weirdos. Online banking, ordering a pizza, sending email – these are all transactional and don’t require you to lose your mind.The above names you mentioned aren’t worth paying attention to. I see them as grifters and mouthpieces of the old world.  Rambling a bit here, but we can make nice lives for ourselves by not consuming the 24/7 firehose. Also, if things do fall apart, we will know people and hopefully have raised our kids to do the same.

        “clot” adams presents an interesting example of this phenomena, this morning.   he has a video up where he recommends white people live apart from blacks, and stop trying to help them.   he gives a number of reasons, but the one that i think is what affected him the most, is seeing videos of blacks beating up on whites.  i have never been a fan of our african brethren, but seeing videos of them chimping out – mostly with each other, too – has really changed how i think of them.  to me they are a bestial sub-species that really should be quarantined in africa.  if they were all to go away, mankind would be improved by subtraction.   this change of attitude is due purely to the internet.

Certainly as I was watching Adams, I was thinking that there can’t be more than an handful of newspapers in the USA which would continue to publish the adventures of Dogbert.

                    KGB: “kept waiting for Rush Limbaugh to start addressing uncomfortable truths…”Towards the end, you could tell that Rush knew what was happening – several times I heard him refer to “whomever it is who is actually calling the shots behind the scenes”, or words to that effect.It was obvious that Rush understood the ostensible protagonists of public life were in fact being managed behind the scenes by private actors &amp; entities whose names we do not know.For some reason, though, Rush declined to push it any further.Maybe he was trying to exist Stage Left gracefully?I dunno.But Rush knew.He made it clear [before he died] that we [to include him himself] did not know who was actually calling the shots.PS: Did you see the tragedy of Rush’s Florida estate? That skanky gold-digging fourth or fifth wife of his SOLD EVERYTHING, and then disappeared.Rush just couldn’t seem to make the transition to the 21st Century; like so many Boomers, his soul was tethered to Norman Rockwell’s Amurrikkkuh of the 1950s, and Rush couldn’t let go of that little corner of Heaven.In all honesty, I don’t know that I blame him.Norman Rockwell’s paintings really do look like Heaven.

                        rush was almost a decade older than me. he had been an adult during the late sixties amd early seventies. truly americas salad days. given he got his information mostly from mainstream sources he probably did the best he could . I think the realization that politics is just theater to keep us occupied wasn’t real for him until the very last.

                This is my position. They view us as “enemies” and white flight seems to trigger their predator instinct and thus they will pursue us no matter where we flee too.
What is needed is a good old fake retreat… mongol style.

                WCiv911:  Poor analogy; implies there’s a plurality of ‘good ones.’  Not so.  Better analogy is the tried and true one of how much shite are you willing to mix into your ice cream and still eat it, and still call it ice cream.

                    @3g4me –“Better analogy is the tried and true one of how much shite are you willing to mix into your ice cream and still eat it, and still call it ice cream.”I nearly spit out my drink.  LOL.There is no such thing as a “good black”.  There are some “less bad” than others, but every one of them will always take up for one of their own when it comes down to it.  Their entire identity is construed of their “blackness” and they hate you.  Every black person has closed door discussions about how much they hate us.I absolutely despise them.  I view them as living cancer cells on the planet.  If you removed all of them tomorrow the entire world would instantly improve by a large margin.

                        “but every one of them will always take up for one of their own when it comes down to it”This is the point that many friendly race realist overlook.  Ramzpaul is a good example.Most of the times that he criticizes black criminality, he will mention than most blacks are good people that he likes.But almost all of these good blacks will support the worst of their race over the values that you believe that you share with them.  Tribalism.  Ethnocentrism.For those old enough to remember, the OJ verdict of innocent was a lifting of the veil.  In offices across the country, whites were amazed when their black coworkers, whom they imagined were like them, danced a jig of delight.

            There is no better feeling for me now than when fantasy world people finally have a head on collision with reality.  It is absolutely stunning to see how they react.  It is an amazing spectacle because they are just dumbfounded.  “This isn’t supposed to happen!”.  That’s what happened with Clot.

                    Yes. Israel is an interesting case. They went all in. However, once it became apparent it didn’t work and that it might just be harmful they removed their Covid police state pretty quickly. Israel really is a model for what the US should be. Does the govt. there abuse its power? Of course. But in the end, they are a people and they need their people healthy, smart and protected from population replacement migration to survive.In the early days there were a lot of Ha-aretz articles promoting how it was Jews who had been at the forefront of the vaccine development and who would save the world. I think that paper’s audience is pretty insular so the scale of backwalking on that is probably pretty small.I do think a good way to wake up a lot of Americans is to just send them Ha-aretz articles that show just how radically different policies and attitudes are in Israel vs what is promoted in the US. The vaccine rollback in Israel vs. the Pfizer vaccine giveaway in the US.There are other things too. Israel is trying to limit porn exposure. We know about the immigration, deportation and wall. Israel is promoting identifying its talented youth and cultivating them.It is a model for us and our people. Of course, when we build this up, we won’t be able to get Israel to subsidize our endeavor. But, when we do build it and it bears fruit we’ll have pride that we made diamonds out of the pressure cooker of TGR.I don’t say this to criticize Jews or Israel. I am ambivalent on that. I just think we should stop moaning and emulate what works and organize ourselves as a group. If dirt poor India can educate their youth and be so successful in STEM, we have no excuse.

                        Considering the ridiculous proportions of human breasts relative to other mammals, one could argue that humanoid creatures tend towards sexual selection for such characteristics as bipeds find it inconvenient to sniff each others’ assholes in order to determine sexual attractiveness.
If they are reptiles they shouldn’t have nipples though.  That would just be silly.

                His wife is a doctor. And he has admitted to getting vaccinated, if that’s what is being discussed here.Otherwise, he just really wants to win debates, in an academic sense. He seems to think the world is just one giant debate club, truth or consequences be damned. Which it is, for a certain group of people who hold no real allegiance to the country they live in, because they have this other little country they can flee to if things get too hairy. Because they have a special handshake to get in.He is wrong about things quite often, startlingly often in fact,  but he just moves on as if nothing happened. Complete lack of introspection. Fits in well with his little buddy over there.

            “Identity for me but not for thee!”Ben Shapiro is basically a used car salesman of conservatism. He talks fast, in a remarkably irritating tone, pitching talking points that usually sound outdated, as if he’s stuck in 1993 or something (only when he bangs on about trannies does he come a little closer to our current year). Plus, Shapiro seems overtly calculated, as you hinted at in regard to his vaccine stance. Everything he says and does appears exclusively designed to pad his own wallet and enhance his brand. It comes off as soulless. One wonders if the man truly values anything beyond his own shekels and Israel.

        Ben Shapiro’s prominence puzzles me, leaving aside the content, because the guy talks so fast and swallows his words so badly that it’s near impossible to get what he’s saying. Same with Candace Owens. I don’t understand why their handlers don’t get them to take much needed vocal training.
This virtual reality also account for the rise of cardboard (if there’s still cardboard) characters like Mayor Pete and Kamala. Why wouldn’t a digital visit to East Palestine (such irony in a name) be just as good as an in person visit? Same with the Southern “border.” And why the rush?

            Everything about Shapiro is fake and manufactured, except his Jewishness…But I think the internet has caused public figures, in many cases, to reveal who they really are…conmen and grifters can’t resist the impulse to be themselves, while the minority of pretty honest and straightforward types stand out in contrast…The main separator of grifters and legitimate people being that the latter will admit that they have been wrong sometimes…..

            About 15 or 20 years ago, I started wondering why all the young actors &amp; actresses in hollyweird &amp; ta1mudvision couldn’t speak properly anymore.You could blame it on the s0d0my &amp; the sapphistry –  the dykes whistling their S’s and the ph@gz lisping their S’s, and everyone sounding as though they have about 8 oz of saliva gurgling in their mouths.But more recently I’ve been toying with several different explanations, such as:1) The Sanhedrin of the Frankfurt School believe that words no longer carry the power they once did, and that visuals &amp; musical sound effects now have far more power over the goyim, or2) The Sanhedrin of the Frankfurt School don’t even give a d@mn anymore, and, at this point, they’re just phoning it in.It’s possible that the Sanhederin themselves are simply bored to death.Maybe that’s why they’re hell bent on imposing the Great Reset; simply to get the Dopamine high again, because the Adrenochrome-infused Young Blood just doesn’t do it for them anymore?
