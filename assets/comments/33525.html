        Just as the Soviet Union ultimately couldn’t deal with the contradictions of communism, the West couldn’t deal with the contradictions of Progressivism. Demanding that society believe that everyone is equal, interchangeable widgets when, in fact, individuals, races and genders are very different was always going to come crashing down in some form or another.

            Yes. Anyone with more than one child knows how different from one another even those who have their own replicated genes can be. People will lie to themselves and others but it eventually becomes untenable. And the labor theory of value is far less ludicrous than Shanika overseeing international space travel.

                This gives you the idea that communism wasn’t really that different from progressivism, doesn’t it?

                    The biggest news today is that what we all knew had to be true, all along, namely that (((You Know Whom))) simply wrote themselves checks directly from the Federal Reserve, was, in fact, true all along:payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups; they literally never denied a payment in their entire career.https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1885582076247712229For well over a decade, I’ve been screaming at people that none of these multi-billionaire-isms [(((Adelson))),(((Soros))), (((Ellison))), (((Bezos))), (((phuckerberg))), (((Brin))), (((Page))), (((Altman))), etc etc etc] none of them have any history of pulling themselves up by the bootstraps, none of their financialisms are organic.Ever since at least 1913, all of (((them))) &amp; their (((ancestors))) were sucking at the teat of the Federal Reserve.Oh, and for the last 40 years, the Federal Reserve just so HAPPENED to beoverseenmonopolistically by the likes of (((Greenspan))) and(((Bernanke))) and (((Yellen))) etc etc etc.Now all of it [to include the several HUNDRED BILLION dollars stolen by (((Zelensky)))], now all of it is sitting in untraceable crypto-currencies &amp; (((Swiss))) bank accounts &amp; Panamanian bank accounts &amp; of course (((Tel-Aviv))) bank accounts.Everything, in the last four decades, going all the way back to at least Black Monday, October 19, 1987, everythingwhich has been written about financialism, has been completely FRAUDULENT.Black Monday was the great experiment, wherein (((they))) asked ((((themselves))), “Do we have the chutzpah necessary to pull off something quite this audacious?”And (((Alan Greenspan))) assured the Council of the Sanhedrin, “Oh Hell yes we can pull it off; just watch what I’ma gonna do next!!!”Fast forward fourteen years, to the late summer of 2001, and (((Benjamin Netanyahu)))assured the Council of the Sanhedrin, “Oh Hell yes we can pull it off; in fact, we can even get the goyim to pay for much of it, viaLarry Silverstein’s insurance policies on the Twin Towers!!!!!!At that point, the 2008 crash was just another giant Bar Mitvah of a Victory Chair Dance for the Council of the Sanhedrin.We goyim are such mouth-breathing cud-munching morons &amp; idiots.

                        You do realize that he called out the Treasury, not the Federal Reserve, right? Not that it’s fine because Treasury, no, but, while a perfectly fine rant, it had nothing to do with Elon’s point.
It’s also a whole lot easier to do something about the Treasury, since everyone in it reports to The Donald, directly or through the hierarchy. Assuming this is true, some of those carry prison time.

                            Which is upstream, and which is downstream:
The Fed?
Or the Treasury?
Or is it even theoretically possible to reliably distinguish between the two?
The only thing we know for certain is that none of the loot made it into our bank accounts.
They’ve been looting us since 1913, andin 1987,they turned on the afterburners [giving us 9-11 &amp; 2008 in the process].
God only knows how much money they’ve stolen, and where it’s all parked.

                                The two do completely different things. It would be like asking if EPA is upstream of OSHA.
From what I’m reading, DOGE now has total access to the payments made. All $6 trillion. This is game changing. Granted, there’s going to be some of that was done with cut-outs, and may be tough to trace, but simply stopping the flow of money to them? Priceless. But there’s going to be a lot that’s in the clear. There may be a lot of weeping and wailing when “non-profits” have to start justifying some of their more outrageous spending.

                            Yes. There are some on here who are absurdly enthusiastic in attempting to pin every dam’ thing on the Finkels. They’re so transparent as to be rather laughable.

                                The Finkels are not directly responsible for everything wrong today, but if there had been no Finkel’s in America from the 1880’s immigration pulse onward, Western Civilization would not be dying. It’s not all of them, but consistently when they can, they weaponize other’s homegrown discivilizational. Our’s had been kept away from the levers of power when WASP’s ruled America. The Finkel’s have them administrating us (Linda Graham, Tom Cotton, etc) on their behalf.The progressives of yore had limits to their bad behavior, because at the end of they day they were a perversion of the European pattern, whereas Finkels have no limits because memetically they are not European at all. We are just lower order animals to them.An analogy from the hard sciences is the notion of a thought experiment. If I had a magic wand and waved it right now, and teleported every Finkel to Israel and instantiated an impermeable magic wall 10 km deep and 30 km high around it so that none could escape, our problems would substantially remain. They would however become solvable through means short of war, which will not be the case as long as Finkels rule the West.Good luck to quixotian Trump, because his restoration project will not work because it will leave Finkels amongst us. They are not going to change. They cannot change, any more than red ants can change. Biting us is there nature. There is no alternative to being in different habitats, except one or the other going extinct.

                                    If you think I’m a defender of the Finkels, you’ve got another thing coming. I just have to laugh at the bloody fools who try to turn every single villain into a Finkel and ascribe every single problem exclusively to their malefeasance. There is Jewish realism, and there is crude Judeophobia. I support the former and reject the latter.

He is also on the record that he intends to return the favor:

                    I am not a billionaire and can’t do the stuff Musk is doing but I understand Musk’s anger perfectly. I have two autistic sons and I have developed a loathing for the system that made them that way.  I was initially attracted to Trump because he talked about autism and vaccination. He disappointed the first time around but he is on point this time with RFK, Jr.. I hope he makes a recess appointment if RFK can’t get through the Pharma-controlled senate. The health care system, like the rest of the established order, is rotten and need a complete rebuild.

            Agreed. But it’s also true that Progressivism couldn’t deal with the contradictions of Progressivism. Just look at NAFTA/WTO, which old lefties opposed (remember the “Battle in Seattle” over the WTO?). There’s always been internal conflict between the hegemony of global capital and the “equity” bs. Since NAFTA, wage growth in Canada and Mexico has been poor and Turkey and Egypt have grown faster (GDP) than Mexico. NAFTA exists to enrich oligarchs. “Equity” is the ultimate luxury good. Progs cannot afford “equity” when racing to the bottom economically. Enter Trump.

Bingo!  What most people fail to realize is that NAFTA produced most of the growth in illegal immigration from South America, and particularly Mexico.  NAFTA allowed American farm imports—heavily subsidized corn—to be imported tariff free into MX.  This destroyed the basic income of the poorer subsistence farmers in the interior.  They moved North.  First the younger males, then their families.  This was fine with TPTB in MX as it burned off their poor and burdensome welfare cases.  Not so good for us as we now see.

                    Why, that’s exactly right. I was thick in the middle of those guys coming up here; what I never understood before was the *how* of how Wall Street managed to wipe out the corn price “floor” in Mexico, collapsing her farmers, her economy, and the peso.
Heck, even the stable 70 year-old reign of the PRI ended with that, minority party PAN’s Vincente Fox was voted in, the ‘big business Republicans’ of Mexico.

                        Yes. The book Dream Land by Sam Quinones touches on this and how it resulted in the black tar heroin hecho en Mexico by farmers who went from subsistence farming to drug trafficking. We all know what happens next.
I can’t recommend this book enough, and it will give you insight into the rise of JD Vance almost better than his autobiography.

                    I have no hate for Mexico or Mexicans.  I grew up with grandchildren of the refugees from their anti-Catholic civil war who came north to work on the railroads.  I knew plenty of Mexican immigrants in Texas and California and honest, hard-working to asshole ratio is roughly equal to that of Anglos.   That said, the Mexican people were screwed over by our combined oligarchs like our working class people were.  I hope the illegals go home and this pressure from Trump forces Mexico to clean up.   I think Sheinbaum should call Bukele for assistance.  Make sure there is room for the white collar criminals as well as the gangbangers

                                I agree with this to the extent that Mexicans will be our neighbors after the collapse, wherever the new border is drawn, and we don’t want to be like the Poles perennially pissing off people we WILL be our neighbors when the last of the war smoke blows away. However, they have not been victimized more than we have been, so we OWE them nothing.
There is no debt or obligation. We should, however, not make things worse by being combative beyond that which is necessary to secure the safety and homogeneity of our people.

I recently did a quick gander of early 20th C. Mexico- they had several civil wars, some lasting for years. I need to refresh on that. War is the business of the anarchists from 1848, rich country or poor, they justwill not stop.

            We moved past “everyone is equal” long ago. The progressive stack became the official policy of the federal government, corporations, the managerial system, and anyone who wants to be a liberal in good standing. You had to believe that “blacks and browns” were BETTER than Whites and that homosexuals and transgenders were BETTER than heterosexual people. Biden even alluded to this at one point when he claimed that the transgenders are “some of the bravest people he knows”, as if a decrepit ancient White racist Catholic from Pennsylvania knows a lot of these people.We probably could have kept this system chugging along for a while longer if we actually kept “everyone is equal” as official policy but once you start actively pushing out the smart and competent for the dumb and incompetent, and you start to see complex systems start to break down, that’s when you started to see revolt, and if it is the competent doing it to the incompetent, well they have the natural advantage.

            One thing I think our side fails to appreciate is not just the differences, but how powerful the forces of in-group similarity are. I think that is even more powerful than the differences. What people fail to appreciate are how emergent the tensions and rivalries are. The ruling class didn’t need to do much to use them. They simply picked a side and assembled a patronage network out of it.Whether or not Trump makes it explicit,Perhaps the biggest move we haven’t fully appreciate yet is the one to banish the “Fill-In-The-Racial-Client-Group Heritage Month”, from the military. Clearly Trump surrounded himself with a team of people who know what time it is.We are going to see the terms cultural genocide normalized in public discourse. Of course, the fall out will be that the fault lines that America never succeeded in eliminating will now begin to erupt more violently. As someone said, entire swaths of the continent and many of our cities are totally disfigured and non-Western.At least this is the beginning of a formal acknowledgement. Of course the Trump people’s goal is to make the multi-ethnic/racial thing work by forcing down a single American identity. It is really the same project as, “The Woke”, in the corporations but instead of picking at the scabs and exacerbating divisions through patronage programs, trying to manage it by keeping the scab pickers at bay and going with, “merit.”That won’t make life easier for Heritage Americans. There are infinite aliens with credentials and skills who will merit dispossessing us. This is not a black pill. It is a fact we are going to have to confront with confidence and organization. Hopefully we have some breathing room to build ourselves back up after 80 years of abuse.

            This is true. AINO was built upon a deranged fantasy. The Mule has kicked massive holes in Leftist Lala-Land and reality is seeping in. There is hope–although I’m still a bit skittish–that we have crested the summit of Mount Madness and are now headed back down the slope into Delightful Dales. If so, we are all lucky to have lived long enough to see this day arrive.

            Eventually, all lies get destroyed by reality…England became the world’s richest and most powerful country because it industrialized early, only possible because it had coal seams near the surface, and used sea power to create an empire it could parasitize for enormous wealth..It imagined itself a land power too, and that arrogance destroyed it…America, with loads of resources, protected by two oceans, imagined it could control the entire world after using foreign scientists to create nukes and missile technology, while indulging debilitating fantasies like feminism, gender fluidity, and civil rights based on race….That was a delusion, some of which Trump probably still believes, but could only end one way….The fact that mid-wit Rubio realized the unipolar world was gone, and talks about it,  is a startling confirmation that the US empire is its the way out…

                I think you do a disservice to the English and the Americans. It is true that we were who we were because of fortune, to an extent. But we had a people who were hardy, enterprising, industrious, intelligent and creative.
Give early industrialization and near-surface coal seams to certain peoples and, well, you know what I’m talking about!
I mean as far as I know, Congo boasts a phenomenal array of natural resources. They were even left quite a functional apparatus to manage it… but then something happened.
That something was The African.

                    He always goes after the English. Notice how the industrial revolution happened in England through chance “only possible because it had coal seams near the surface”. This is absolute rot and the sort of thing a DEI nincompoop would confidently utter as he seethes..Some coal seams being near the surface is not unique to England either on a world scale or if we limit out analysis only to Europe.I wonder what his excuse is for the Agricultural Revolution which took place in England? Maybe the crops were closer to the surface?England has produced more mathematical theories,more scientific discoveries than any other country in Europe. Is reality closer to the surface in England?What’s your ethnicity, pyrrhus?

                        Ostei,
Am I correct in thinking that Detroit used to be called The Paris of the US, or something?
Apparently, it was quite a powerhouse and a beautiful city before the Hutus?

                            That’s exactly right. Before the arrival of the nuggras, Detroit was a truly opulent city. Vast sums of money from the automotive industry allowed for the construction of score upon score of architectural masterpieces. But then the so-called “civil rights movement,” occurred, whites were juridically shackled, negroes were liberated, they inundated formerly white wonderlands such as Detroit, and within a few decades they had become Third World ruins. This happened to virtually every major city in the US, but nowhere is the before/after disparity quite so stark as in Detroit.

                            I saw a web site once of old pictures of Detroit, before and after Africans. The middle class areas were clearly prosperous and beautiful. The new middle, aping their betters as has always been the way, invested their new resources (thanks, megachad Henry Ford! &lt;-this great man tried) in front-of-house stonework the quality of which I doubt even our current vapid merchant clown trash ruling class enjoys.
Africans destroy everything, if you let them.

                                Why do you think England “owes” anyone anything?  And who is “us”?  The two wars were a bankster-fueled tragedy.  Plenty of blame to go around – no more brother wars, and let’s not have White-on-White ‘sniping.’  Stay focused on what matters – a future for White children.

                            I’ve noticed a concerted effort on twitter to try to drive a wedge between Europeans/Canadians and Americans.  A lot of contemptuous insults from both sides.  Totally counterproductive and likely initiated by our enemies.  The problem being that centuries-old Euro rivalries don’t die quickly so it’s fertile ground for discord.

        What truly stuns me about this New Trump who now no longer wishes to reform a irredeemably broken system like his 2016 iteration, but is Gozer the Gozerian in 2024, is that whenever he decided that shift, he managed to keep it a very closely guarded secret from his enemies, and ensured this assault was a complete and total surprise. I would bet that the Mar-a-Lago raid wasn’t about the ostensible documents, but a search for intelligence on Trump’s potential actions if he was elected, which they could use to ensure he was not. Somehow, Trump was able to completely outwit the Gaystapo, because he’s completely blindsided everyone, worldwide.

That’s an interesting way to look at it, and I’d not considered it. Then again, I don’t have an adept political mind. But it was certainly a surprise, that’s for sure. Thanks for the insight.

                    Kinda puts the lie to all those conspiracy theories that were “debunked” on the grounds that there’s no way so many people would have kept it secret.
In the same way that they “debunked” the existence of monopolies and trusts. Too many people involved. Yeah, right.
Or Snowden. How many people in the CIA, and but for people like Binney, pretty much they all kept their criminal behavior hidden.

            Brilliant. Like OF, I had not considered this possibility, but the raid very well may have been geared to recover this information and perhaps disrupt it. The assassination attempts even may have been part of the same scheme.
eta: And yes, this is a Revolutionary Trump vs. a Reformer Trump, a Putin rather than a Gorbachev. I’m shocked as most here are, and it is a fantastic development.

            Personally, I think the raid was to make sure he had no copies of the documents that he had ordered declassified. Things like the Russia Hoax and the Hillary emails and election fraud and the general lawlessness of the Obama regime.
I suspect they got some of that. But evidently he didn’t have it all stashed at Mar-A-Lago, or he would not be in the Oval Office now. He had enough short and curlies in his grasp that they could not risk him releasing it, and cut a deal.

If you look at it right, this is a major game piece proffered, a concession to BRICS. Give a gift, expect a gift. Your move, BRICS…do you want to be Maduro’s Venezuela and deal, or Ramaposa’s South Africa? (whom Trump just cut off. The rand is crashing, nobody wants their GND bonds.) Carrot and stick.

            To Z’s point about the destroyer here is an interesting post from one of managerialism’s toughies:“I am about to be laid off; where do I even find a new job?Thanks to the executive orders issued by Our Greatest American Patriot President and his overwhelming mandate of 49.9% of the vote, my company is going under. Because nothing screams, “America First”, quite like making thousands of Americans unemployed, right?Anyway, I have spent my entire 13 year career in the field of international development. I have no skills or experience outside of this field, and every job I have gotten is through niche, industry-specific sites like Devex or ReliefWeb.

This guy’s not normal. He hates normal people. And the fact he’s so delusional is big part of the problem.

            USAID also finances the NGOs responsible for flooding the USA with illegals.  The Trump Admin. took a direct shot at Catholic Charities – they pointed out how much money they get from the Feds – when the USCCB raised a protest about the deportations.
I think they’re getting inside USAID and finding out it’s a much bigger problem than the realized.  I’d be willing to bet they went in there looking for the illegal migration money paths and found lots, lots, more.

        Sometimes just blurting things out loud, which Trump is good at, does a lot to help make something normal, and as a bonus, makes leftists cry.

                        No one will read this. Nevertheless, because I’ve been “find 3g4me” your comments on this blog for decades:She may have been the progeny of Maverick, Paul Tibbets, and Chuck Yeager. Neil Armstrong with different plumbing.The problem with female military aviators (and women aviators in general):Every male pilot who flies with them or trains them has to guard their speech and correction/help constantly. Give “extra chances”. Be silent when better pilots were never trained/hired because they were given more. They’re “good enough”, usually.No sane male pilot trusts them. Unfair, because plenty are very competent. (BUT YOU DON’T KNOW. Poor male pilots are weeded out..at the start, in the middle, and as they age. Not so, women.)Male pilots don’t have this problem. “You’re screwing up..FIX IT!” After landing: “Ok, let’s go get a beer, discuss this, and reach an understanding.”They don’t trust them because you don’t know if you’re dealing with a progeny or someone every other pilot kept their mouths shut to keep-along-to-go-along until the next training mission or commercial pilot shift…..then avoided them like the fucking plague…..forever.I don’t know what happened here.I have…suspicions.(There are plenty of adequate, average female aviators.  Also, male aviators.  That’s what average is.  We’ll never know in this case.  Trump knows though.  That’s why he said what he said.)

                            I am flattered that you look up my comments, and I completely agree that while some female pilots may well be competent, there is no way to know and thus one should always assume preference or lower standards were involved, just as with non-white pilots, doctors, etc.

        Unfortunately I see Trump’s populist moves as surface level, designed to solicit buy-in back from the white Republican base that has been so turned off by American society over the past decade.  It brings to mind this perfect 2019 4chan comment:
The clue and giveaway that Trump caved to upper elites behind closed doors in 2024 is that, other than the fact that he was allowed to win a controlled election, Trump’s criminal and civil trials disappeared, the elite-owned media stopped endlessly calling him the equivalent of Hitler and started treating him neutrally to even positively, and the shitlib NPC mobs were placed on idle-mode stand-down —this would literally not have happened unless they were comfortable and accepting of whatever role they now have for Trump.
I think he will be used either to start World War 3, to usher in central bank digital currencies (which will result in the greatest loss of freedom in human history), for the Greater Israel project, or the elites will crash the bubble they created in order to smear Trump and populism.
Dark days are ahead, imo, regardless of these surface level populist moves.

                Wild:Iran might be THE reason Bibi is the 1st foreign leader Trump has in the WH.All Trump’s moves so far are directed against China who already won a technology war with US.China’s main weakness is a lack of oil. Oil is a main reason Trump wants Canada. Iran presently is a major supplier of oil for China and will stop being so when Ayatollahs regime falls.Russia is another supplier for China, but Putin has his own reasons to detest China. Couple of days ago Zelensky whined that Putin and Trump are already negotiating, but he is locked out.Ukraine could be not the only subject they discuss.Being ahead of China and thus keeping $ as a reserve currency seems to be #1 on Trump’s mind.

            One minor quibble: They never stopped calling him Hitler. That’s ongoing. I’m willing to bet money there will be a big stock market crash that they pin on him. In fact, I have.However, some of what he’s doing indicates a philosophical change on the part of the “elites” who are backing him, to be more pro white/pro nationalist. I don’t think there’s any way around that. You could say it’s because they need white men to fight their wars, but even so, even if it’s only for that purpose, they are still advancing pro white policies and getting pro white discourse into the conversation. Which is only to the good.

                A stock market crash is almost impossible under a zero interest rate Fed. Elites would be crazy not to borrow at 0% and invest, which is going to drive up market caps.
Problem is that 0% also fuels inflation, depending on how fast that trickles into consumer hands.

I had been expecting one or the other tseveral decades ago, but once I fully understood the Cantillon effect, realized why it had not happened yet. So long as they can keep the demand side retards (Covid Cash, Cash for Clunkers, etc.) under control, there is no reason it is imminent, or even inevitable.
Ponzi schemes end when you run out of fresh meat. The Fed does not run out, so long as money is staying within the moneyed elite.

                                Agreed, we should be doing a lot better. And rather than investing our wealth, we have been squandering it on giveaways to useless eaters, foreign and domestic.
But so long as the Fed keeps the giveaways to the rich going, they will overwhelmingly pump a stock market bubble, a yacht bubble, a mansion bubble, etc. because they simply do not buy enough consumer goods to affect inflation.

            Agree. Academic Agent has also been talking about this since Oct 7 when he noticed a sudden shift in elite attitudes towards Trump. He also predicted the “woke being put away” exactly as it happening now, when it still looked like the woke would be here forever. They will concede some ground on the trannies (so “based!”) while still drilling us on everything else.

                There was an interesting twitter debate last week between AA and Auron MacEntyre about whether or not the shift heralded true elite circulation, or just a rebellion of one or two factions. AA (rebellion) got the better of it, I think.
However, setting the Oct 7th angle aside (for the moment), the rebels are largely billionaire oligarchs, who finally see their chance to dispense with the managerial class with whom they have been forced to share power for the last century or so. Whether a neo-feudal aristocracy will rule better than a bureaucratic one remains to be seen.

            “The clue and giveaway that Trump caved to upper elites behind closed doors in 2024 is that, other than the fact that he was allowed to win a controlled election, Trump’s criminal and civil trials disappeared”Regime/social change happens when the elite start bickering between themselves.* Then someone, usually part of the elite, can create an elite coalition with populist support and wipe the floor of everyone else. It just happened in the 2024 election.Trump clearly has the Tech Bro and a good chunk of the American Jewish elite on his side. Thus Trump needing to offer unequivocal support to Israel and muted support to H1-B visas. Yes, that probably will not change, unless he goes completely Mule.Much Internet commentary tends to treat the elite like a monolith, rather than a class of people with their own competing ideas and personal preferences. As long as it doesn’t touch them personally, the governing elite are fine with many of these populist reforms. Nobody really wants to live in a city with apartment buildings with gangs. For sure, the elite have no desire to die in plane crashes/helicopter rides piloted by diversity. Most people are deeply disturbed by men in openly drag, regardless of any other consideration or how much brain washing they attempt on themselves. Trump seems in no danger of prohibiting the careers of any homosexual children, and thus he’s not perfect but okay.In other words, the endless black pilling is unnecessary. Trump has accomplished more in 2 weeks than I ever expected of anyone in my lifetime. We know already where his weak spots will be – legal immigration and Israel. Let’s not have the perfect be the enemy of the good.(* “We’ll have grassroots revolution” never works despite the love affair with them of activist Jews and some Anglos/French.)

            A more hopeful explanation is that some of the oligarchs realized the Dem obsessions were getting out of control.

                It is not an exaggeration to point out that we were on the brink of a nuclear war with Russia for most of the last 15 months.  My theory on Trump’s win, and the IC largely staying out of the election, is that everyone at those “elite” levels realized they lived in the crosshairs of hydrogen bombs.Democrats were, and are, on a suicide mission.  The tranny stuff is a side show.  The real issue?  The collapse of the USA as the reserve currency and the collapse of the world into anarchy and world war.  It doesn’t take an elite genius to understand the catastrophe that was coming had Harris won.She is, as I’ve often decribed, “stupid dangerous”.  Don’t forget, somebody in the Biden Regime decided to launch US-made, US-operated, and US-targeted ballistic missiles at Sovereign Russian targets in DECEMBER.

            I have no doubt a deal was made, but it wasn’t the one you are thinking of. My money is that he handed them copies of stuff he had declassified, removed from the White House in 2020 and 2021, and currently held under a dead-man switch.
Your move, swamp.

                    So long as the expected consequences are sufficiently dire, it’s never needed. FBI has all the Epstein dirt, and it’s obviously bad enough that no one who even suspects he might be on that list has said “Boo” about reining in the FBI.
Which tells you something about the Trumpistas. Sounds like to a man they know they are not in that list.

            A revolutionary government would deport Musk first.“Sign tapping,” the 4chan term for reminding people of that post, because it’s been done so often it needs a shorthand, is good. It reminds us that we’re ruled by liars. But those liars also gave us the sign. If it’s on 4chan, it’sallowedon 4chan—which is no longer the whole madness/autism of the world distilling itself into a little bit of revolutionary genius. It’s “social media” now, as fake and faked as the rest. Even Instagram has good things (young women demanding attention in traditional ways) on it. They’re not the reason it exists—notthe work.The great error the sign reinforces is the idea that because geopolitics is “bigger” than domestic repression, it must be more important to Them. Understandable. Given the boots, would youbestride the worldorstomp the face? If the former, you’re a normal person. Trump is normal, too. But how much of the new current thing is him? Maybe most, maybe only the good parts, maybe only the weird old-timey Teddy Roosevelt crap, or maybe none.The “tech bros” in charge care aboutnothingbut stomping your face. If we add up all the new happenings that we like intohow much actual work it is, it’s almost none. “Here are some memos we prepared earlier.” (Good and right memos, with few exceptions.) What’s everybody else doing? Is “world war for Israel”reallythe answer? Is anythingnewreally needed to make that happen? How did America—the people—finally join WWII, switch en masse from opposing it to supporting it? There was nocarrot. It was decided.The endorsement/plagiarism of the sign by every untrustworthyconversoamong us is a warning. Are they “putting the woke away?” Who is? Some loyalists of the other party are being fired. That’s good and normal. (Republicans don’t normally do it, because it’s good.) Some businesses with ad budgets think they’ve spotted a trend they can capitalize on. That’s normal. (They’re lying.Business is lying.) Are our sons being hired? They are not. In fact, they’re more disdained and hated than ever—and that’s not only allowed on Twitter but endorsed by its owner, joined by all his lackeys, etc. And you’re allowed to go pretty wild against Israel. But you’re not allowed to blast the Jews fordomestic repression.“Censorship is Jews.” Post it. Do it.Do it!

Correct.  The answer is no.  Instead, Princess Snowflake the Pretend Pilot continues to crash the culture, to which she has the keys.  She shore loved wearing them fancy helmets!  Chicks don’t belong in the cock-pit.
The Borg will take the Trumpist uprising out on the nation’s sons, quietly and outta view, in the classrooms and corporations, in the courts and the churches.  Nothing yet has been de-fanged.

            I’ve seen some type of post hundreds of not thousands of times. Even if this is all accurate, the American Empire is still not worth fighting and dying for. I don’t see some surge of White guys going to enlistment offices to fight and die for Netanyahu. Israel and the media tried mightily to gin up hatred of Muslims like it did after 2001, and it didn’t work. Israel is in far worse shape in terms of reputation and goodwill than it was on October 6th, 2023. By all accounts it was Trump who forced the cease fire on the Israelis.There is also significant pushback on elements of Trump’s agenda. He’s already lost one nominee. There’s a decent chance he will lose 2 more soon. The media is on a full court blitz against the tariffs. Maybe they aren’t calling him Cheetoh Hitler anymore (except they kind of are…) but they are pushing back.Based on everything I have seen and read, the situation is not so much as the 4chan post describes but that you actually did see some faction of the elite revolt against the incompetence and idiocy of the Brandon regime that took hold after the 2020 color revolution. It just went too far. It’s not crazuy to think that certain powerful people thought the woke agenda was out of control and undermining our nation’s readiness and influence. It makes sense that certain powerful people would see the effing STATE DEPARTMENT flying gay and black flags in our embassies and think that we look like a pathetic joke. I mean, even a guy like Chuck Schumer, yea he’s juice, yea he’s evil, but he’s not stupid, he’s old, he grew up in a different world, I wouldn’t be surprised if he recoiled at this stuff privately.We aren’t used to seeing factions of elite fight each other because we have been living in the End of History since 1991, but it is pretty common.

            Even as a certified pessimist, I’m holding out hope and cheer for Trump.  So far he’s been pretty good other than thanking blacks and mexicans for their support in his inauguration speech.  This pandering to a base that doesn’t support him or Republicans in general is infuriating.

I mean, look at all the long past their prime acts from the past in the Rock categories. Green Day? Pearl Jam? The Beatles?
Heck, even the hep ‘Song of the Year’ winner drops two references to the early and late 90s in the first 30 seconds, those being the movie theSixth Senseand the long-retired White sportsballer John Stockton.

            The way that a certain online subset focused on Beyonce winning or not winning certain Grammys just tells me how ludicrous our society is. Like, this isn’t a one time thing. They’ve been talking about this for at least a decade. They firmly believed that there was some sort of racist conspiracy against the biggest pop star in the world to keep her from winning one meaningless trinket as opposed to the dozens of other meaningless trinkets she has been awarded over the years. And predictably when she won yesterday they acted like the demon has been slayed. People don’t realize this entire setup is literally and totally fake, Grammys (and Oscars and Tonys and all the rest) are fake and voted upon by a small group of people who want to put on a show. People think it is real.

                This reminds me of when Denzel Washington was up for an academy award for his portrayal of Malcolm The Tenth. That little reprobate Spike Lee went on a rant, telling everyone how if his movie didn’t win every category it was nominated for, that it was proof that Hollywood was indeed run by jews who hate blacks. Washington of course didn’t win for best actor and when asked if Lee’s outburst had anything to do with the academy’s decision, Denzel just looked at the reporter and shrugging said, “What can I say, Spike has made himself a lot of enemies.”

            I feel the same way about this that I felt about the advent of legal homo marriage. Just as heteros wrecked marriage long before the homos ever took a crack at it, whites destroyed country music many years before the negros got around to it.

        Taking aim at USAID is not something I had on my bingo card. It changes virtually everything I thought I knew about this man who has been so prominent in our lives for so long. It puts him far closer to what I hoped we would get somewhere, down the road, and not the guy who I actually thought Trump was.I have no doubt that this is the sort of work Trump wanted to do his first term, he just didn’t know how to do it and didn’t have the people in place to do it.It is now starting to make sense why the regime threw everything it had at him, and even tried to kill him TWICE when all else failed. Trump is truly blessed to have the enemies he does, people who happen to be both stupid and incompetent.

            The last two weeks are a damning indictment of Trump as much as they are of anyone else. For how completely unprepared he was to govern in 2017. There isn’t any other way to spin it. I guess all’s well that ends well. Until they pin the big stock market crash on him and his tariffs.

                Well put.  However, I must say—so far—he’s running the board.  I thought the market would crash sooner.  Seems being the “cleanest dirty shirt in the hamper” has value I’ve underestimated.

                Yes, I haven’t forgotten his utter ineptness (if that’s what it was) in 2017.
He puffed up and yammered endlessly about ‘bringing new blood’ into D.C., then hired all the usual Swamp crocs and put his prog daughter in charge of the WH.
First thing outta his mouth was let’s all excuse and embrace Hillary and get the country going again!  puke  Heck they had him shilling for the poison vax before shipping him back to Mar-a-Lago.
I’d never watched his TV but all I heard about was whoa, this dood can pick employee talent!  He’s a management genius!

                    If only somebody had taken a few potshots at him in 2015…I guess that old saw about ‘it takes a two-by-four just to get a Mule’s attention’ must be true.
I do miss the Goya beans commercials, though. Ivanka looked fabulous!
Notice it was underappreciated Tiffany who got the spotlight this time, along with Barron, instead of that fop Junior and Javanka. Javanka actually looked rather subdued…I think the gleam is off the apple of Daddy’s eye. Didn’t see Kushner rushing to offer any of his Accord riches towards any of Daddy’s legal bills, either.

                    To be fair about him hiring swamp creatures, I was listening to an interview with Sebastian Gorka several months ago and he spoke of how they had the resumes of between 300 – 400 people who were going to be the “new blood”, He went on to add that he had all of that info on his personal laptop in a safe in his office and he walked in one day to find the safe open and the laptop gone, along with all the info on it.As for his globalist daughter, that was something he should have seen coming a mile away. Like he didn’t know that she and Jared were good friends with the Davos crowd.

                Yes, he was totally unprepared, but the only people willing to help him were snakes and subversives. And the deep state immediately put him on the defensive with the Russia hoax. They took out one of the few potentially competent loyalists he had on his team (Gen. Flynn). It was a disaster. No doubt about it. I also don’t think that all’s well that end’s well – we lost four years of a golden opportunity. In hindsight though I am not sure how much better Trump could do considering the circumstances. He didn’t have the team he has now.

        Right now, members of Elon Musk’s team are combing through the records of USAID, the hive mind of the NGO collective that has controlled American foreign policy for decades.Thedomesticeffects of these shadow departments and agencies will be the most mind-blowing. Those caravans of child rapists and murderers flooding across our border did not pay for themselves. This actually is revolutionary in effect and goes far beyond Neocon perfidy although it certainly includes that, as you note. American taxpayers have been funding their own dispossession and the terrorism against them as a people.As an aside, the FBI is acting as The Resistance. I had joked in the past that the Bureau would end up like a reverse Waco, with the J. Edgar Hoover Building in flames as deadenders inside take a last stand. Apparently the communications among agents are being encrypted to coordinate The Resistance, but the instructions are being hacked by the Tech Bros. Comey’s epistle to the FBI Resistance is unintentionally hilarious but telling. The thug enforcers, of course, are highly expendable for the deadenders in the Regime.This is beyond huge. It is pivotal and, again as you note, it is just starting. I found it quite amusing when Musk met privately with Sen. Young of Indiana, a Pence protege and critic of the Tulsi Gabbard DNI nomination. Apparently the South African relishes his role as The Godfather.And speaking of, the human rights violations of white South Africans are about to have consequences. Beyond the foreign policy implications, this is a major turning point against the anti-white nature of the Regime.

            I still doubt that Trump has either the will or ability to deport enough non-Whites to make a significant difference to AINO’s ultimate third-world fate . . . BUT.  Cutting off the money, taking over their databases, and shuttering USAID is huge.  I am enjoying this immensely.  And watching in delight as every counter-measure by the borg thus far has been anticipated and blocked.  But do note the ‘thus far.’  I don’t put anything past Schumer and the financial-political shadow government.  I don’t know that Trump can truly overturn the existing order, but I applaud all his efforts thus far.  Musk is dangerous with his electric car thing and I loath AI, but at least for now he’s using his skills in a productive way, and I love the Panic of the Bureaucrats.

                He doesn’t have to deport any. All he has to do is shut off all the gibs.
No more welfare of any kind. Throw landlords into prison if they can’t prove they made a good-faith effort to determine the citizenship of those he rents to. Banks comply with Know Your Customer when it comes to ratting us out. They should be fully able to comply with law on non-citizens. Someone is facilitating the remittances. There are stiff criminal penalties, including prison, for employers who hire illegals, even unknowingly.
It just takes an aggressive DOJ willing to enforce the law.

                    eta: And to be fair to Trump, who no doubt is courageous, the Cloward-Piven strategy of those who ran the Biden White House required more balls than any one individual man has. I suspect civil forfeiture and so forth is next to speed along self-deportation. The NGO’s no doubt were funneling money directly to the invaders once in place, and that’s gone, so state and municipal welfare is the last funding source and that’s likely about to go. Cloward-Piven usually works but sometimes it scares the right people to take drastic action to counter it. Thus far that seems to be the case. This is what would be expected from a fearful counter elite.

        When the president blames diversity for a plane crash, the world has truly changed.It is staggering to me that he may of said this. I guess I ought to dig it out, but I trust those here.I’m not in any mindset to even begin to think that Trump is going to make things better in four years, but none-the-less, it is a significant change compared to that which came before.Of course, it is a far cry from saying things like “blacks cannot function in white societies”, or that “Musselmen need to go back to their lands”, but it still is something. And I hope it continues, whatever it may be worth.Every day that goes by reveals that the races, ethnicities and cultures that now festoon western nations cannot live side-by-side. And they are completely different to the hosts, whose lands they now arrogantly dwell in; often with no understanding of what it took to give them the things they could never build on their own.At the weekend, I was reading about the English inventor Thomas Newcomen, creator of the atmospheric engine. Whilst looking over the technical details of the thing, built in the early 1700s, it occurred to me that despite its seeming simplicity, it was still a complicated device, and one that even a modern man (perhapsespeciallya modern man) would struggle to build and understand.What did Africa have at this time? What of the Japanese? And the Mongols? Or those in Mesopotamia?Answer: not much.

            I might quibble about the Japanese. There may have been a stratified nation with a warrior ethos … but their poets, philosophers and artists rivalled ours. They independently invented Calculus in the 1700s. I’ve actually become fascinated by them.
Today their subways are clean and safe, the vast majority of the streets are clean and safe.

                But here’s the thing:They didn’t industrialize.The gulf between the rest of the world and the West was turned from narrow to wide by the inventions coming out of Europe from the 1400s onward.I’m intrigued that they independently discovered the calculus, and would like to know more… but even this was likely 30-50 years after Newton and Leibniz.I do agree that there is more to a society than engineering feats (the Egyptians apparently kept pretty much the same culture for thousands of years), and Japan may well be in a better situation than the West is now. But philosophy, mathematics and art are really intellectual things, with limited practicality: printing presses, steam and atmospheric engines, cabling and electrical transmission are actual things that drive civilization forward in the most obvious and impressive ways.

                    No telling what the Japanese might have done if they’d opened up to the West a few centuries earlier.  However. One must note the speed that the Japanese moved once the decision was made to “modernize”.In 1860, they sailed a ship they bought from the French to California to visit and learn how to sail a blue ocean modern vessel.  In 1905 they defeated Russia on the high seas in the Russo-Japanese war!  What country you can name has ever made such progress so fast!  In 1945 the Japanese home front was bombed flat!  In the 1970’s Japan was the acknowledged leader in consumer technology.  In the 1980’s we spoke about Japan Inc!

                        The Japs seem to have a natural yen–so to speak–for many Western artificats. Not just the industrial, technological and engineering items, but the cultural stuff as well. They took to classical music (and baseball) like ducks to water and many of the greatest classical musicians, conductors and orchestras nowadays are Japanese. (They don’t, however, produce elite composers.) Japanese scotch whisky is acknowledged even by the Scots as comparable to their own. Japanese gin is also exceptional, and their dedication to the fine art of raising beef and preparing steak would make Texans blush.When the Japs get the bit in their teeth, they’re good. Very good.

                The Japs, although a rather bizarre people, are absolutely worthy of great respect. However, claiming their artists, poets and philosophers rival our own is a bit of a stretch.

            The thing that still boggles my mind is transatlantic cables laid in 1853. Good gods. That speaks to such a depth of scientific capability I can scarce believe it. People still used quill pens, blackpowder rifles, coal steam, stone masonry, and oil from whale fat, yet these guys were able to deduce the physical principles of electromagnetics, metallurgy, and ocean infrastructure.Carrying not just live electricity, but coded electrical signals across the bottom of the sea!

                    “You go back in time and don’t know how to do anything but die” stories became a sci-fi fad circa WWII. The explicit message was always about the necessity of cooperation, etc.—except from Alfred Bester, who was a purist Shakespearian “hubris” guy—but there was something else there, and it eventually showed itself.
In France! The originalPlanet of the Apesnovel was a less esoteric variation on the story.Camp of the Saintsfully exposed the subtext: Send the West into the past, via death/replacement of its men and what they know, and…the end.

                This weekend I was enthralled by youtube clips from two ethnocentric sides; Debunking History is a stout Anglo nationalist, HomeTeamHistory is a well done, detailed, very reasonable African nationalist.I salute both for honoring their ancestors and defending their people. What black HomeTeam has done, inadvertantly, is illustrate one glaring fact: that even with a thousand years of Arab and Berber influence, Africa’s highest civilizations progressed to the early Bronze Age, and stayed there. Stacked stone (not mortared), mud walls, and slave economies was the very best they could do. (Even the Christian South, such as Axum [Ethiopia], were slave gateways to the Islamic world.)Of note is the environmental change; desertification led to Islamic camel transport and slave economies taking Africa’s northern half, a replay of increasing cold driving the Yamnaya and Aryan horse-hero cultures to the agrarian west and south.(Likewise, Comanche Empire and the Apaches [slavers driven south by the Tlingit slavers of the northwest], also saw their agrarian neighbors as easy pickings.)(Side note, tsetse flies kill horses, as malaria killed Europeans, so no wheeled carts and only goat husbandry or bushmeat. Euros only colonized the coasts until quinoa bark- quinine – was discovered in Peru.)Africa’s lack of navigable rivers, flat plains, and a mild Mediterranian Sea, discouraged trade and trade in ideas; I believe her density of language barriers and hard tribalism were a defense against the spread of abundant diseases.Fecundity, an extra leg muscle, and higher testosterone plus those Erectus ‘ghost genes’; tube roots and a temperate climate means the Congo Negroids never had to get smart, they just had to run faster (and f**k more) than the Neanderthal-derived KhoiSan minority, once the Ice Age ended and they could come out from hiding in the Congo highlands.

                        Misread, it was the lack of flat plains, and the tsetse fly making horses non-tenable. Are durable roads, rather than dirt roads, worth the effort when everybody is a pedestrian?
The wheel question came up; a few times heavy, blocky carts with solid wheels were used for some king’s fancy, but there was simply no desire to walk grain or heavy loads across long distances. In contrast, the Central/South American stonebuilder culture stretched from southern Mexico to Brazil across inhospitable terrain, with hundreds of miles of Roman-style stone roads.

            I found myself thinking along similar lines this weekend, prompted by some fiction with the usual “Whites stole the red/brown/black man’s lands!”  lament.  Aside from concluding “So what?  Conquering others is what men do,” I then imagined a world where Whites did not explore past the European continent.  But even without ships and explorers, Whites had astronomy and geography, going back to the Greeks andRomans.  They had longitude and latitude and maps and measurements.  What did the black Africans have?  What did the Indios have (spare me the ‘glories’ of Macchu Picchu)?  There is no alternative timeline without evidence of White superiority.

Good to hear from you. I pray all is well in your locale and with your family.
Yes, that lament is very, very common. It is worth noting that seeing that conquering people is what other people have done (and will continue to do), many places like Africa, India and Australia ought to count themselves lucky they fell under white dominion.
Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think it was great for them. But when you look at what the wise Red Man was doing to his enemy, one pauses for thought.

                    I don’t see any way they would have been better off if they had not been colonized by Brits, though. Not ideal but most African countries have gone downhill post-colonization. I say that as an anti-imperialist, too.

                A brother, who spent time with the Mayans- there are quite a few left, barefoot, living with their chickens, and literate, a kind of CentroAmerican Amish- the Mayans told him that since time immemorial, they have always known their ancestors didn’t build the great ruins in either in Central America or the Andean highlands.
Bearded Quetzalcoatl taught them the masoretic ways of stone and stars.They remembered, and kept building, but the knowledge was brought to them by another people, a white people from across the sea, a truly ancient trail of red and blond heads that circumnavigates the globe.

                Compsci,
Ha!
I was looking at old engravings, sketches and photographs the other day. In many of the images, of North East England from the 1820s onwards, it actually looked like a lot of the folks in the background were black. Now, of course they were not, it was merely the quality of the photograph; but I quickly imagine Today’s Leftist making the case that:
Look! All of Northumberland’s miners were black!
But as we all know here, what we think of as extreme satire, Today’s Leftist sees as her reality.
God bless you and yours.

        In the mid-Sixties my brother and I gobbled down the Foundation Trilogy.  The Mule was a telepath, like some of the nonverbal autistics.‘When the president blames diversity for a plane crash, the world has truly changed’The pilot’s identity remained mysterious ’til the news cycle struck low point, Saturday. Turned out to be (gasp, who could have predicted?) another empowered princess feted and promoted far beyond her capacities. Once again, playing gender-pretend resulted in the deaths of the innocent. This is what a feminist nation looks like.Her identity was squelched because the Future is Female has been the national chant since the Nineties, and it is inconvenient for national assumptions about ‘gender’ to be proven elsewise, aflame. Nobody’s daughter wants to become a woman and a mother. Everybody’s daughter wants to become a man. All institutions celebrate this.Donald went halfway by blaming the crash on diversity. Had he blamed it on feminism directly — the truth — then the world would have changed.

            Just speculating, but it could have been her false confidence as empowered women are prone to have. Also, just speculating but based on more hard evidence, but BOM was right also about diversity being the cause due to the shortage of ATCs as a result of rejecting so many qualified white male applicants over the last few years.

                The only problem with Handmaid’s Tale: the Male Version, is that Princess wasn’t the pilot, or even the crew chief, unless I’m not up to the latest MSM revelation.
Not to blow my own horn, but as I said, the crew didn’t authorize their own flight, somebody put them in that situation.  Somebody who knew their, um, deficiencies.

            She was probably also part of the American Jewish elite. Not just a feminist princess, but a Jewish one as well. If we wanted earth shaking, it would have been both feminism and the comfort level of American Jewry to grab on to whichever roles they feel entitled to.

                    Just to get you up to speed, yes, there are Jews in the military, almost all of them in officer corp. It’s not choice they make often, but they do make it occasionally and out of a desire for ambition and influence. Generally, you will almost never find them in the non-commissioned ranks. In place like DC, officer experience counts.

            I see a few women at the gym hitting the heavy bag.  Decent timing and technique.  The hits make a solid sound.
But I wonder, based on F=MA, if the M of the striker is significantly less than the M of the target, can you really generate enough A to make up for it?
How would these 90 some odd pound ladies do against a 200 pound opponent that hits back?

No. Don’t even have to do the math. There’s not enough distance to create the acceleration necessary. Now with a sling armed with a rock at 50 feet, that’s a different story. Or a bullet at 5 feet.

They wouldn’t.  There are videos of female recruits at boot playing pugil sticks with male recruits.  It’s not pretty.  Nor from what I could see, were the males “taking prisoners”.

At least the girls have a better chance, for sure. Especially against a 200 pound sheboon, where they’d really need it.

        The left under Obama was never a threat to Eurocratic rule, and was why Europeans hailed him as one of the own. The well spoken, darker skinned resurrection of JKF – “Ich bin ein Berliner”!Following in Obama’s footsteps, Biden brought woke-ism and corruption to even greater heights which was fuel to the liberal bonfire. A bonfire the left and Greens danced around with their pink hats on.Trump just is like a Mars water-bomber and not only doused the bonfire, but has scattered the left running in panic. Those on the right who have been trying to bring sense to the non-sense they were forced to accept, are now seeing a light at the end of a tunnel.Canada and Mexico are the first dominos to fall. Europe will tow the line because they know their economies are directly tied to the US since China proved they don’t need German cars or engineering anymore so that market is gone. Like Canada and Mexico, there’s nothing Europe has that America needs.Well done Trump!

        A lot of this has been ideological blindness. If a mule cannot exist, why create countermeasures or even think about having them? The masters might be aware but the rank and file get utterly blindsided. The masters cannot get their toadies into that mindset without bursting the hyperreality bubble.if the system can be killed, then there are potential alternatives and you do NOT want people thinking that way.thus the system itself is self limiting. Trump is using that to his advantage by “just doing things”.Beyond going after the throat by going after the money, trump has revealed the system HAS a throat which is huge.

            Agreed.But we need to remember they have teeth, claws – and, dare I say it – brains.Right now the bad guys have been caught by surprise. It is far too early to celebrate. Eventually they are going to recover from their shock, and they’ll begin to retaliate. I see at least one assassintion, possibly several coming. Maybe even a civil war?The cartels stand to lose hundreds of millions – billions – if the borders are secured. They will start fighting you in your own cities. Fire fights are starting to break out already on the border. What about the deportees? Can they take their money with them? If not who gets it? Or the property they leave behind? What happens when Canada collapses and prolapses? Does Trump really want a 51st state that’s more retarded than California?ain the new multipolar world, what happens when European aligns with Putler? There is a lot that can go seriously wrong in the days ahead.

                I’m more optimistic.  The “intelligence” borg has been penetrated, and even the deepest of the deep state knows it is being watched.  Sending out their groomed assets, as may have been the case with the first two assassination attempts, may no longer be safe.  I was doubtful any lasting change could occur, because the next Dem president could simply hire back the same corrupt actors.  But if Trump releases all the deep state secrets, it’s a pretty powerful deterrent for future Brennans/Comeys/Clappers.The military can handle the cartels, who have a lot of firepower but not much brains.  I do hope Musk takes his security seriously, as his money and fearlessness have been essential to what is unfolding.

                I absolutely agree that the last thing either Canada or the United States need is to be integrated. But as for the rest of the items, I’m far more optimistic. The cartels sparking a border war could be positive and step up forced migration, for example.

        It didn’t end well for The Mule.
The men backing Trump this time are deadly serious. The founders of the US were famously gambling their “lives, fortunes, and sacred honor.”
There’s no going back for any of them. They either win and win big, or they’re going to be utterly annihilated and they know it.
To paraphrase that great quote from The Hunt For Red October:
Captain Ramius: “You’re afraid of our deep state. Well, you should be. Personally, I’d give usone chance in three.
More tea anyone?”

            “It didn’t end well for The Mule.”
A gentle reminder of how a gerontocracy can possibly work to an advantage under the right situations. How long is Trump going to live? God willing, he will exit office at 82. His youngest son he’s seen to now young adulthood.Give him 20 years of doing anything, the ending is not pleasant by default. He has very little to lose in that sense. If he feels he’s a man doing God’s work who is less than 20 years from being called home, there’s very little that would constitute a “bad ending”.

        If you’ve read Zelazny’s “Creatures of Light and Darkness” (I know you’ve read his “Lord of Light”), Trump reminds me of the Steel General. Even if you dismember him piece by piece, his followers reassemble him over the centuries. He’s the very epitome of rebellion.
The Mule violated the laws of psychohistory and gave a new lease of life to the galactic empire. I hope Trump does no such thing.

            There is another interpretation of The Mule. His great weakness is to be treated as a human. For an outsider population, the great danger is acceptance. A world that assumes it can assimilate everyone is confounded by a population that refuses to assimilate, but the population eventually succumbs to acceptance.

                And it’s a retarded interpretation cuz Mule ain’t human, so it follows its retarded to treat him as such. Now a more favorable spin on that…thing nitwits pass off as an interpretation is a warning about acceptance of people who are different from you.

        The saying is walk softly but carry a big stick. Trump is stomping about and is using that big stick. Unlike the previous men that wielded it…Blumpf seems to be doing a good job with it.
I hope it’s paranoia… but I worry about the gods of karma a bit. Blumpf is making very, very powerful enemies. I’ll bet there’s a dozen assassination plots on the drawing board as we speak.
perhaps our Esteemed Blog Host got this one bass ackward? The managerials are the mules and the destroyer of worlds? It depends on your perspective I guess.

                That’s exactly how it worked before; Trump tariffed countries, which devalued their currency, and upped the value of the American dollar we paid them, both which made their exports more affordable. It evened out, the price inflation hungered for by never-Trumpers did NOT occur in the historical record.
(I do remember Iowa farm radio, the grain and pork producers were feeling hammered by the drop in exports to China, so it wasn’t all roses.)
Despite the naysayers, we’ve forgotten $1.97 gas and 3% mortgage rates.

        i wonder what norm eisen and his buddies will do the next time there’s a dem in the whitehouse. Because if there’s a preemptive pardon by a repub admin – does that mean they resort to executions?
I also wonder what will happen with the DC district court. If the dems try a color revolution and they all get arrested – won’t someone like Chutkan (and a dc jury) just drop the charges or acquit?

        “Everyone needs to remember that The Mule is the destroyer of worlds, not the creator of them.”
Every creature takes a dump, in some form, because expellation is a basic function of all living organisms. Mule is most likely no different, save the enormous size of whatever is considered “a dump” for him. Fertilizer.
Also, trigger warning for the Jew enthusiasts – Asmiov was a Jew. I think. Don’t care.

            Hadn’t thought of that, but I think it might play a large part. How about aid to Israel, since USAID is ostensibly to “promote American business.” (The class I attended was run by a Dutchman selling drip systems from California to Israel and MidEast/Central Asia, his nickname overseas was the Big Drip.)
When I hear the stock “do you think Israel has a right to exist?”, my automatic rejoinder is now “do you think Palestine has a right to exist?” I don’t know either way, but this is a another big holdout from the Twentieth Century.

            It also explains the overdue attack on the South African government’s oppression of whites–the country has led the international effort against Israel. I’ll take both actions regardless of the motivation.

                Another aspect I missed. You know, that might explain Trump’s “love of Zionists” leverage that leaves us knuckle-dragging antisemites gnashing and foaming.
He’s from NYC, he’s done a lot of business in New York, and Florida, and overseas. Like the Zman, another East Coast denizen, he’s familiar with and used to the ways of the small hat. He doesn’t get spooked by those ways, and knows how to play their game.
So, he speaks “Israeli”. Their way of business is predictable to him, it is better to use a tool one is comfortable with, than trying to reinvent the wheel.

        About 2,000 comments into this thread so far and not a single mention of that letter of the alphabet situated between P &amp; R. Despite the fact that DJT has retweeted *between P &amp; R* memes a comparable number of times over the past 7 years. A fact I attribute to no-one, absolutely NO-ONE, wanting to be seen as a *between P &amp; R tard!* VERY declasse!And yet if between P &amp; R was actually real, as (the obviously hallucinating) DJT has inferred many times via his retweeting, this would explain so much of what this author and thread is struggling to understand. What if between P &amp; R is an anonymous spokesperson(s) for an anti Clownworld insurgency that has been in existence and growing in strength for a long period of time? What if this counterinsurgency had embedded its agents throughout Clownworld over the years, thereby knowing EXACTLY where all the bodies are buried, so to speak? Enabling laser focussed, pinpoint action against all the Clownworld players and funding sources when the time was deemed right?I sometimes get the feeling that it is only the between P &amp; R tards who really understand what is happening right now. But I would never express that publicly. Wouldn’t want to be seen as a between P &amp; R tard, obviously.

        I am proud to say that I also saw the character “The Mule” in the rise of DJT.  An event/character that could also be called a “black swan” that could not be anticipated. This is the first time that I have seen this insight (Foundation Trilogy).

        There’s a lot of hopium in this post and the comments. It reminds me of the Q believers in Trump’s first term. What grounds are there to be hopefully? Trump is running his mouth and temporarily disrupting things, but has so far not actually accomplished anything, same as before. And we are seeing indications that Manchild Musk is more powerful and malign an influence on Trump than Kushner ever was.

            Kushner never shut down USAID. And there’s reason to be hopeful that the courts will take the Trump view of birthright citizenship.

                The USAID thing is good.  Not as sanguine about the court and birthright.  What catdog fails to appreciate is that even 5 months ago these things were unthinkable.  Whether successful or not, the first step has been taken -from the unthinkable to the thinkable.  In reality two steps have been taken – the second being from the thinkable to the triable.

            USAID shut down.  DEI rolled back.  The border under control for at least now.  Deportations and more importantly the significant threat of deportations that is inducing self deportation,  underway.   Who knows what will hold long term but he is still far preferable tban that nutty bitch  Also can we retire the hopium/copium variants. Those are some really ridiculous words
