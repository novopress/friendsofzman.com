        I was born in ‘69, child of the 70’s, and it was pretty damn good compared to what these kids have today. I enjoy “That 70’s Show,” and it was a pretty accurate depiction of the time. People for the most part were attractive, fit and active. We ran around outside playing sports, riding bikes everywhere, mom warned us to be home before sunset, which we rarely were. There were good movies and tv shows, although sitting in front of the boob tube was not a way of life.There was great music as well as some bad, but all eras are like that pre  2000’s. Now it’s all shit. Zeppelin, Frampton, Fleetwood Mac… c’mon great music! Now everything is rap hip hop, sappy three chord dreck, or deliberately dissonant, un melodic screamo metal, not the melodic metal I grew up on in the 80’s.We were not indoctrinated or politicized as kids, we were still “taught” just the basics. The nanny state was’nt a thing. There was a lot of freedom for kids and adults. These kids are now brainwashed with leftist propaganda, suspended or expelled for wearing a tee shirt with an American flag, bombarded by the tranny cult, hounded by the use your pro nouns or else ghestappo, glued to screens around the clock, 24/7 tv, the phones, video games, now you have to kick them out of the house to get some fresh air and exercise, only the go sit in a park, face firmly implanted in their smart phones. They don’t know how to socialize. It’s not a generational divide as in the past, it’s a completely different and not a better world.One thing always left out when comparing fashion, music and social trends of past decades, is the fact that at the time, everyone followed those trends and thought they were cool. The leisure suits bell bottoms, and pork chop side burns of the 70’s, the square shoulders, acid washed jeans, oversized shirts and mullets of the 80’s. It’s only in hind sight that some of the very same people who were all into those trends look back at them with disdain.Please give me a freakin break!At the time you thought it was cool and thought YOU were cool. It’s only when the next fad comes around the corner you disdain the “old cool.”One thing that never goes out of style for men, Levi’s straight leg 501 or 506 jeans, a tee shirt, polo or button down shirt, well fitted and when appropriate a sport coat. Cowboy boots, sneakers, dress shoes depending on occasion. It’s not hard. Please try to avoid the goofy, Amish beard fetish and its variants. We’ll be looking back at that with similar disdain to leisure and jump suits soon enough.

        While leisure suits were indeed stupid, it seems every generation has its hideous fashion trends. I’m old enough to remember the huge skirts, lurid lipstick, and greasy duck’s-ass hairstyles of the 1950’s, beehive hairdos, hair curlers seen in public, and bullet-bras of the 1960’s, etc. However, the current craze that truly disturbs this old man is young white girls covering themselves with huge, gaudy tattoos. The other nonsense came and went, but this fad is basically forever, but you can’t tell THEM that!

            Totally agree. Mode of the 80’was hideous too.IMO, the best time was the age between the 90’s and the tattoo era :Circa 2000-2005, we had abolished the “too-large suit” of the early 90. Women were sexy, oftenly in (moderately)-high-boots, and their skin was immaculate.
(for men, my favorite era would be France mousquetaire era, circa 1620 ; late 15th and early 16th in west Europe ;  France near 1825 and, also, during the 1790′)

        I agree with Z’s assessment of the 70’s versus now and the 70s as a warning. However, I also see the 50s and 60s as warnings and significant precursors to the modern world. A lot of the young dissident right views the 50s and 60s as a whitetopia ruined by those evil boomers who were all hippies. Like everything else, reality was different than what the media portrays it as being but the media’s narrative resonates so strongly emotionally that the truth is rejected.The element of the 50s and 60s that I find the biggest precursor of the modern era is that is when the elite showed they felt more affluent kids were valuable but working class and poor was expendable. Middle class and wealthy kids were viewed as too precious to kill in Korea and Vietnam thus the college deferment. It was fine though to kill off the working class and poor so they could be drafted. This situation was fine with most college kids because they were happy just not to have to go to Korea and Vietnam just like most of the middle class has been fine since the 80s with the war on the working class.

        Terrycloth jumpsuits! I won’t miss those! Arguably, though the styles of the early 80s were even worse than the 70s. And the music, ecch!

            I emerged from puberty about age 15.  It was the eighties when my high school basketball coach’s wife seduced me in her bright yellow terry cloth jumper. She was a former BigTen cheerleader. A summer of s_x schooling followed, which I associate with terry cloth. Oh hell yeah, go terrycloth!

                Degenerate boomer brags about degeneracy of his salad days without having wised up even a bit in the intervening decades.  Wonders why his generation is generally blamed for turning country to crap and why current generation are trans in polycules.  Waddles up stairs to big RV with “I’m spending my kids inheritance!” bumper sticker and rolls sadly away.

            As noted in my posts below I’m an auto racing fan. Earlier this summer someone put up on YouTube an un-edited (save for removing commercials) NBC broadcast of the 1981 Michigan 500, the first 500 mile Indy Car race broadcast live (5 years before the Indy 500 was broadcast live same day on ABC). The announcing team includes Paul Page and . . . . . Bruce (not Caitlyn) Jenner.Talk about being taken aback! 😲 I want to time travel back to 1981 and tell him “Stay the HELL away from anyone named Kardashian, for the love of all that is Holy!”

        Carthage thought it had found a permanent formula after the second Punic war but it’s goose was cooked right then and there. For fifty years it enjoyed unparalleled prosperity while it sacrificed its infant children to Moloch and then it was destroyed right down to its foundation stones. It was surrounded by those damned Numidians you see but it was largely a commercial empire so its leaders continued oblivious to the danger.  It didn’t see just how precarious its situation truly was, or if a few did, there was nothing they could do about it. Everyone who comments here understands we are living in a fool’s paradise. That’s the only thing I really know for sure. Whether it all ends in a cataclysmic denouement next week or in twenty or fifty years is the only question.Strolling down memory lane I recollect the great paean  by the Stones, “Sympathy for the Devil.” The reason I dredge it up is I *almost* have sympathy for that immortal being for the simple reason that I have the devil’s nostalgia for what I’ve seen. My first memory of the larger outside world was Sputnik. Then came the Cuban missile thing and then Dallas and everything after that. In one somewhat twisted sense, I feel privileged to have been a witness to the most momentous events in human history. I’ve always taken a detached view, not so much as a participant but an observer. I believe we will continue to remain privileged for as long as we remain “spectators” but eventually the Devil will have his due.

        Today’s post would be a golden opportunity for me to really expound, as the history and philosophy of economics has been one of my longstanding interests. Theology, ontology, philosophy of science, and philosophy of economics have all been matters of mature and reflective avocation for me, and are subjects I feel I can comment upon with some authority. However, since I’ve already laid out my basic economic prescription for the United States in a previous post, I’ll refrain from repeating that material here.Instead, I would just like to encourage everyone to be hopeful. The manifold ways in which the world will benefit from a great deleveraging now exceed the acute pains which are sure to attend the event. I don’t mean to minimize the pains or to make light of the suffering that will occur, but this thing feels like it’s ready to happen and wants to happen. When the current monetary regime blows, it will take most of the Wokeness and the Green agenda with it. It won’t solve every problem, but it will be a welcome Thermadorian respite from the excesses of 20th century overhang.I have to say, I’ve cut down my online activities quite a bit. I have been banned from “Moon of Alabama” on the absolutely ridiculous grounds that I posted something off-topic in a Ukraine thread. I did no such thing. In fact, all I did was become more critical of Russia for its slow pace and security lapses. I have always supported Russia in this conflict and I still do, but I am not one of the 5D-chess apologists who spin every boneheaded move by the Kremlin into some triple bankshot master strategy, and the Kremlin has committed some mighty boneheaded moves lately. It would be incumbent on the friends of Russia to offer some compassionate criticism at this point, because Russia seems determined to extract defeat from the jaws of victory.What that means in the present context is that we cannot count on Vladimir Putin to defeat the empire and build the multipolar world order. Frankly, I don’t think he knows how to do it. I have taken to referring to him as “not a wartime consigliere,” which I think is the most pithy and accurate way to describe him. He’s a good man with good leadership skills who was the right man for his time, but it’s not that time anymore. Lovers of tradition and sanity will have to start looking beyond Putin for inspiration.

            You could say that Putin’s mere continued existence is a defeat for the empire. That every day that the war in Ukraine continues is a defeat for the empire. These things demonstrate to everyone, every day, that there is a sphere of the world not just beyond GAE control, but capable of thwarting GAE intentions.

                I could, and I have.Russia’s example in standing up to the GAE has taught an important lesson to people everywhere, but I think it’s most notable aspect has been not the SMO in Ukraine but the withdrawal from the global banking cartel. That was the moment when someone finally proved that you could step outside the holodeck and not vanish. It was, and is, an incredible accomplishment.About Ukraine, though, I think Russia has gotten itself stuck. Yes, they are winning the “war of attrition” on the battlefield, but what kind of war of attrition is it really when you allow the enemy to keep funneling in equipment and mercenaries? The number of destroyed Ukrainian troops and equipment just isn’t the right metric anymore.The right metric is wiping out the Zelensky regime and its Western backers. Until somebody actually has the guts to attack thecapos,the war will continue. I don’t think Putin is that person anymore.

                    &gt;The right metric is wiping out the Zelensky regime and its Western backers.Time will tell.  But if Ukraine is just the bloodiest front for the West in what has become a global conflict, I’d say go even slower…If Russia’s economy is set to actually grow this year, as is my understanding, then I would say that in Ukraine the Kremlin has both the watches and the time.  So why rush?Zapping Zelensky now gives his backers an out.  Better to leave that albatross hanging around NATO’s neck until at least this time next year.Meanwhile keep applying pressure in the Ukraine, in Syria, in the Sahel, and so on.  Force the West to lance their own boils.

                    Putin is well aware that ending the Zelensky regime and/or conquering all of Ukraine will not be the end of the war. Maybe he has reasons not to be in a hurry to push it to the phase that would come after that. You don’t think the GAE is just going to stand down if Ukraine is defeated?

                    It’s a real dilemma for Putin, since he could easily send the tanks into Kiev, but America’s leaders are so unhinged they might just press the Big Button. So he has to walk a fine line.

                    I am far from a military-geo political expert. But it seems the current trajectory is Russia up, GAE and Ukraine down. Why would you do something to change that trajectory? As the Taliban showed, you beat the GAE by not losing.

            I think Russia is carefully choosing the timing of important military developments in Ukraine, and not simply slow rolling its activities solely for attrition purposes. A lot of critical political developments are scheduled over the next 18 months; including elections in Russia, USA, Europe, and Taiwan. A big military victory occurring late this year could significantly influence the outcome of many of these elections. And the strategic goal for Russia is not simply to bury the corruptocrats in Ukraine (which they can do at will), but to undermine the globalist leaders in the West that are the real enemy. They’re playing the long game, and by next Spring will have a highly productive economy, balanced budget &amp; favorable trade exchange, and nearly 1.5 million men in arms. That’s a pretty strong hand to play going forward.

        I bet if you were to poll random Americans, and ask them if the USA should (A) threaten global and agricultural markets by not respecting the territorial integrity of the Russkiy Mir, and (B) should threaten global manufacturing by trying to overthrow the Chinese government and that of its neighboring allies, you would likely get something in the neighborhood of 80%-99% “no” to both questions. Maybe a little lower depending on how many stalwart liberals you ask, but the point is, this behavior is just objectively insane, and not in the interests of American citizens. The American government obviously does not work for its citizens and have not for a long time. We all know this. It’s run by a tiny cabal of lunatics who, despite what is said about “our sacred democracy”, always are around to screw things up and make things worse. The junk that Bill Kristol said about Russia lately is just as wrong – completely – as the junk he said about Iraq was, yet he still remains a member of the DC elite in good standing. It is like we are on a bus being driven off the cliff by a psychopath who refuses to let go of the steering wheel. I really don’t see any way off the bus.

At this point even those lacking the spiritual intuition to see undeniable evil as it jumps up and down and demands we notice it…  Occam’s razor pretty much demands we acknowledge the literal devil exists.
The “conspiracy” is so far reaching, well coordinated, and universally malign it obviously cannot exist as a matter of human agency but its nonethless everywhere to see.

        It seems fantastical to think there was a time when Russia needed to import food. It’s not really much crazier than saying there will come a day when America needs to import food. People would look at you like you’ve got three heads. But in Russia it really did happen.In the present day, it’s also almost impossible to wrap your head around China being colonized and controlled by foreign powers from another continent, with relatively minimal military intervention and very little actual geographical colonization. The “century of humiliation.” It seems today as far fetched as the same being done to AINO.Two almost unimaginable things that have happened before, that I’m going to say could conceivably happen again. Here, instead of there.I see below that Zeihan has come into today’s discussion. I’ve read at least 3 of his books. He’s right about some things. The end of the “order” is happening before our eyes pretty much right when he said it would, if not exactly how he said it would. He looks at age demographics a lot. He completely 100% ignores racial demographics. He assumes all the new “Americans” will be just as functional and productive as all the old Americans. That the nation will be just as cohesive as it was. That’s his flaw. And that’s without getting into the heritage Americans who aren’t up to snuff with their forebearers. Which brings me back to where this post started.

                In Iraq and Afghanistan the Army outsourced the food service to civilian contractors. One wonders why they haven’t yet done the same at home. That doesn’t necessarily end the possibility of staffing shortages, but it appears the problem is a lack of Army cooks, not lack of cooks period. For what they were paying in the ME, folks were lining up to do it.

                “For months, one [dining facility] was open and was a more than 30-minute drive for my soldiers,” a noncommissioned officer who anonymously spoke to Military.com said. “All the soldiers were going to that one. It’s unmanageable during the workday.”I think of my late father, who was actually “In The Sh-t” in the ETO in WW2 in a US Army Infantry Division, eating either C-Rations warmed over a feeble fire or whatever hot slop “Cookie the Cook” for his unit could slap on his mess kit, or even worse, cold C-Rations while worrying when Real No-Fooling Not Sees would drop artillery or mortar shells on them or launch an attack on them.I can only imagine the invectives that would pour forth had he read that quote.

            For virtually all of its history Russia hovered around the edges of food scarcity, and that scarcity was exacerbated to the point of famine by the malicious and deranged policies of the Bolsheviks. In point of fact, the proportion of Russian arable is and has been small. The Ukraine, of all places, has been Russia’s breadbasket, and it is now largely under the GAE’s thumb. This may be yet another reason Russia invaded.

            I agree with Zeihan. I also think that the, ‘just add more new young people’, crowd is just the tail end of the dead end of the quantitative thinking that has driven us into this ditch. It is just Keynesianism dressed up as demographics rather than pump priming – Krugman’s spend to extinguish debt fallacy.A nation is far more than an economy whose health is measured by the volume of refrigerators and toaster ovens you sell to flesh meat sacks. The boomers bought a bunch of things, but how healthy is the economy in their wake? That says nothing of the health of the nation which to me looks like a piece of fabric dangling in a room of ferile cats. It is being torn to shreds.Someone here mentioned the commercial empire of Carthage. I have never thought of that angle before. Very interesting. I am going to have to look at that.

You understand which particular depth we’re talking about here, Massa Gynecologist?
I’ve met GenX &amp; Millennial chicks in the last few years who worship the BeeGees.
And Boomer chicks – they’d walk over broken glass to get to a BeeGees concert.

                    Early in the “AI” tulip-mania, among musicologists there was a fad for quantifying the complexity of popular music. Anyone who can hear notes and do simple arithmetic (in bulk) can do it, but automating the calculations for masses of songs only became possible a few years ago.The first finding: Judged by harmony, timbre, rates and degrees of change, etc., popular music became clinically retarded the day “Black Hole Sun” left the charts, and its IQ has been sloping steadily downward ever since. This musicological fact is racist, sexist, “rockist,” and “auteurist”—in sum, anti-corporate—so now it’s forbidden to judge music by harmony, timbre, rates and degrees of change, etc. Academic musicology now consists almost entirely of young women’s shopping diaries (“autoethnographies”).AI really did kill my profession.

                A lot of people remember the ’70s fondly because they were young at the time despite the overall picture being rather shitty. My own youth was not quite so idyllic so I was redpilled right from grade-school.No doubt, the ’70s were freer because you did not have the nanny state/Karen state, you did not have surveillance cameras everywhere, you did not have digital databases everywhere, you did not have the social media panopticon and you did not have cancel culture.The Left was beginning to usurp the institutions, but the default culture at the time continued to prize free speech, free press, the ability to speak out against the government, and the ability to pretty much do as you pleased so long as you did not physically hurt someone else or damage his property.

            And then music too fell off a cliff in short order, I’m going to say about 1983. The cultural decline has been long evident from that perspective. I have this notion that societal rotting goes in stages, one which must precede the other, and the decline in music showed up well before the decline in most other things. Circa 2000, most everybody thought everything was hunky dory, but by then the music has already been mostly garbage for a good decade and a half, indicative of some kind of cultural rotting from the head down.

                Much like special effects improvements did to movies, MTV and video did to music.  It became more about the spectacle (visuals) rather than the music itself.  However, there are always a few gems in the mud.

I agree that after the mid-1980s, the floor fell out of the house.
Something absolutely bizarre happened to Western Civilization between 1984:

Note that the collapse does align almost perfectly with the Bush 41 administration.

Back in the day, I studied about a decades’ worth of Billboard Top-20 songs, comprising roughly two hundred “hits”, from 2000 through 2010.
And only ONE song had a clear identifiable hum-able whistle-able sing-able melody:

The rest of them [199 or moar] consisted of nothing but very loud grating ear-piercing random noise.

                    Bourbon, I am an amateur musician, have been musical my whole life, I practice 2 hours a day, so I think about music in ways that the average person does not.I used to wonder if my distaste for the music of the last 30-40 years was just being old and out of touch, you know, like the old folks who disapproved of Elvis back in the 50s. But careful specific reflection has shown this not to be the case. I have always enjoyed, still do enjoy, music of all styles, all genres, even rap (what very little of it is listenable). I have never been closed minded to any type or fashion of music.  No, the truth is, popular music in recent decades has become ROTTING STINKING GARBAGE

                        Yes, I was 24/25 myself. Typically, after every paycheck I received, I’d go down to the Sound Warehouse and snag an album. But it just so happened that, in 1992, I could simply no longer find any albums I wanted to buy. The music had become boring and uninteresting. And, from what I’ve gathered, it has only gotten exponentially worse since then.

                        That seems a little off.  1991 was one of the greatest years in rock history:Nevermind,Loveless,Spiderland,Laughing Stock,Gish, and good albums by U2, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, RHCP, Massive Attack, The Orb and others.  It’s not like suddenly, a few months later, everything went to shit.
1992 saw the release of Pavement’s debut,Slanted and Enchanted,Dirtby Alice In Chains,Wishby The Cure,Harvest Moonby Neil Young, and others.  Music still had lots of room for whites.  After the Millennium is when non-underground music became completely touched with the tar brush.

                Since about 2000, women’s styles of dress keep getting progressively sluttier/more skin. What young women commonly wear socially today, even the hookers in the 80s didn’t dress that slutty. Other than that, I don’t see much change either.

                    Where I live the trend is deliberate uglification:  more tattoos, and unkempt hair dyed unnatural colors.
And this is on increasingly older women, even grandmothers.  It strikes me not so much as a style as it does evidence of sickness.

                        There is geographical variation to this. The slutty is more where the “beautiful people” are. The common factor throughout is the tattoos. “We’re a bunch of nonconformist rebels, all 150 million of us.”

            The 70s were a time with some of the best music ever, some of the weirdest, some of the blandest, and some that wasn’t good at all.  But back then we weren’t assaulted with the crap that is rap, that is now pushed on us in heavy doses.  (which begs the question, “just who is doing that, which group wants us listening to rap and hip hop continually?”)

        Economic and sartorial considerations aside, the 1970s were paradise compared to the present. Yes, the hypodermic filled with cultural strychnine had already been plunged into America’s heart, but the effects of the poison were bradytelic and had not yet manifested themselves to anything like an intolerable degree. Pop music was wonderful–arguably better than the 60s and 80s–television shows were often very funny and entertaining in other ways, Hollywood produced films that captivated one’s attention rather than enraging normal people via deranged moral homiletics. What’s more, there wasn’t an image of a negro plastered on every wall, and glaring out from every screen. And needless to say, the war against whitey existed in only the vaguest outlines.All in all, if the 70s were a prefiguration of what is to come, it was a rather pallid one.

        “The one thing missing from this picture is brown leisure suits.”Look Z, I lived through wearing plaid polyester pants back then. Since I was a kid my mother bought them for me and that’s my story and I’m stickin’ to it. I’ll keep the khakis and the polo shirts thank you very much. 😏As others have recounted the mid-late 1970s and into the early 1980s sucked because of stagflation, ridiculous interest rates, and the hangover from Vietnam. Blue collar union jobs were starting to disappear with the closure of steel mills and auto factories. We let the Japanese into our auto industry while they closed their markets to any foreign competition. That said, there probably wasn’t anything American made that the Japanese wanted as the 1970s to the early 1990s was the absolute nadir of the American auto industry (Vega, Pinto, Mustang II, Aspen/Volare, Citation and its X Car brethren, ad infinitum).But at least we were still making things here and still had some sort of industrial base. Now, most new car plants in the US since the 1980s are car companies from somewhere else who’ve settled in the non-union South. Steel mills? I suppose we still have a few, but nothing like South Works in Gary, IN at its height. Heck, China has us by the short-hairs manufacturing wise. How long would it take to start up manufacturing in the US?That said it’s good modern cars last longer these days since it costs so much to buy them and pay them off. And wait until the government that gave you CAFE and crappy compact cars in the 1980s mandates All Electric All Time Vehicles.“In the end, we may look at the 1970’s as a warning about what was ahead for the American Empire.”We are so boned. 😔

            It’s going to be wild when Congress allocated hundreds of billions to mass produce tanks only to find out that reality isn’t a video game where weapons fall out of the sky once you pay the money.
Going to be even funnier when the new diversity bilks the government for all it’s worth and charges tens of millions per drone.

                When the price of gas goes up, the politicians will blame Big Oil price gouging, like always, to distract blame from themselves.
As for parts shortages:  Absolutely.  China can put the squeeze on at will.  Right now I am waiting parts for my tractor and my wife’s SUV.  They’re on a slow boat from China.  How slow is up to Xi Jinping.

        Everything about this coming era will be far worse than the 70’s.  All of our poor decisions over the past 50 year will magnify these issues.  For instance, in the 70’s, the U.S. still had a strong manufacturing base, even if past it’s peak.  Today, we have “hospitality and leisure” as our economic driver.  A large part of the price of a manufactured product is its transportation to the store.  In the 70’s the store could have been a few states away from the factory.  Today, nearly everything we consume was imported from another continent, and the cost of moving those goods will be far higher.  If those foreign currencies of manufacture appreciate against ours, the problem is magnified even further.Putting our catastrophic demographic issues aside, which alone will preclude competent leadership going forward, the tearing out of the country’s industrial base, which was predicted in Triffin’s Dilemma (circa 1960) combined with a government driven financial crisis as this long era ends, would leave the country in the most flat footed situation in history.  We would need millions of new manufacturing and export related jobs overnight to take advantage of our depreciated currency, but those jobs take decades to develop.  What would happen in that 10, 20 even 30 year period?  What would fill the void?   In my opinion 1).A mass expatriation of the population 2) an explosion of political violence as tribes fight it our for scarce resources and 3) a place similar to the third world where anything not bolted down will be stolen and looted.  And even some things bolted down.

            jrwirth:  I remember the ’70s, and they sucked.  But when I imagine waiting in gas lines now . . . amidst all the lovely diversity . . . I envision massive conflict and violence.  As bad as things were back then, I was still able to get an entry level job as a teen.  I was able to purchase things – admittedly often crappy – that were made in America.  I still thought saris were exotic.  My innocence and ignorance of the sexually perverse in the early ’70s was shattered in college in the late ’70s, but I still had no clue what a trannie was (actually wait – I did know about Renée Richards, but thought it was a one off).There was no such thing as ‘diversity’ in the ’70s – there were blacks and Whites, and no one claimed that the expression “black as sin” was rayciss.  But the seeds were there and beginning to sprout.  I was still young, though, and filled with hope and expectations about my life and future.  Now I’m an old fart, and now the long march has culminated in globohomo and its champion AINO, and I want it all to crash and burn.  And regardless of my wishes, it looks as though we will all have to learn to navigate the wreckage if any remnant of our race and culture is to survive.The Greeks and Romans had monks and some Arabic manuscripts – as well as remnants of roads and buildings – to testify to their existence and erudition.  AINO will have “Heather Has Two Mommies” and the ruins of shoddy construction designed by women and built by mestizos.  ‘murrica f***k NO.

            Who is going to provide manpower for a resurgent manufacturing base.  Twenty-seven year in the my factory has seen a work force with one black man, and a shop full of white engineers and machinists transform into a place manned by African “asylum seekers” and slackers.  Of course we are on our ass losing money and fading fast.
There will be no new manufacturing base.  Hispanics and Africans, women, jews and pajeets do not do hi-tech manufacturing.

                Exactly this. High-tech manufacturing is the domain of Whites and Asians. America no longer possesses the human capital to compete globally in high-tech manufacturing.This, and a host of other issues, have made me wonder whether the Chinese Exclusion Act was a strategic mistake. Had it not passed, the West Coast and most likely everything west of the Rockies would have been majority Asian, rather than majority Hispanic as it is trending now. US politics would be dominated by the interests of Whites and Asians, which are far more closely aligned than the interests of Whites and Hispanics, or Whites and Blacks.

                    I would still prefer Mexicans to Chinese.  Mexicans aren’t a threat to whites except in their voting power under “muh democracy.”  Asians would have out competed us, which is why the REALISTS of that era knew to exclude them.  They should have gone further with another tribe that feigns being white for advantage.There is East Asian kryptonite however.  This is called “gambling.”  Asians are hard wired to work 80 hour work weeks and then gamble it all away at the Mahjong table.  It’s at a genetic level.  Primitive Asians were fishermen.  Their eyes are even shaped like fish.  Their brains are hard wired to catch fish.  This same genetic abnormality sees blinking lights on a machine, or rapid movement of dice, and goes into a trance like state.  The brain still thinks its catching fish, just in an Indian casino.If California, and other states, hadn’t legalized Indian casinos, the Asians would be far more dominant than they are now.

This really does need qualification/extension.  Mexicans are a threat perhaps not existentially, as Blacks are, but politically they are really too stupid to hold such power.  Where in the majority, they elect political grifters with the best of them and the economy suffers.
The big issues of the day: abortion, crime, pollution, schools, welfare, and climate change, they are little different from Leftists–in the main.

            Answer to all these people that think that United States will become the Third World, in these comments and others:You won’t be like the Third World. The Third World are poor countries where everything is done in a manner compatible with poverty.You will be a poor country where everything is done in the manner of a rich country.Here, in the Third World, public services are bad but taxes are low. You will have high taxes and bad public services.Here in the Third World, we have low salaries (not my case) but we don’t worry about climate change. So we don’t have to pay expensive products because carbon taxes, we don’t have regulations about electric cars, etc. You will earn low salaries but products will have all kinds of environmental taxes.Here in Central America I drive a car who had an accident in the States (this is my second crashed car imported and there is a whole industry around it). He was imported here and we have artisans that let these crashed cars like new. It is a good car (it seems like new) and has been way way way cheaper than in the States. In the States, this would be against the law. You won’t have the money to buy a car with the US price but you won’t be able to buy a car like mine.So, no, you won’t be like the Third World. In the Third World we are used to the lack of resources and we know how to manage it. We find suboptimal solutions  to everything. They are suboptimal (the optimal solutions are the ones of the US golden age), but they are solutions. You won’t have any suboptimal solutions before the system collapses, if it does. You will have sub-sub-optimal solutions like sh*tty public transportation instead of a car.

        I was in grade school during the ’70s, and I remember it pretty well. It was definitely a mixed bag. The country was much whiter, much thinner, and, very importantly, had 130 million fewer people so there was a lot more space. The early ’70s were mostly a continuation of the prosperity of the ’60s and a continuation of the Cultural Revolution of the ’60s, but the wheels really fell off starting in 1974-75 or so. I remember watching Nixon resign in 1974, that seemed to mark the beginning of the decline (although in reality it was happening prior to that). New York City was a crime-ridden shithole, factories started closing, unemployment and “stagflation” was a problem, inflation became a problem, drugs were a problem, race relations were a problem, cars became smaller and shittier and they started putting emissions controls on them. The “classic” cars that Boomers prize so much today are almost all pre-1974. Nobody tools around in a restored 1978 Chevy Chevette or Citation.As an early Gen Xer the decline was evident, Boomers 10 years older than me who got high-paying blue collar jobs prior to 1975 or so were pretty much set, by 1980-81 the job market was totally fucked and interest rates on mortgages were 13% and used car loans were 21%. You could see the incipient cultural collapse in the music of the day.  Disco was obviously corny, stupid shit. Rock and roll became completely degenerate. In 1975-76 you had KISS touring and Fee Waybill dressed in drag at the same time a fat, bloated Elvis was still playing Vegas before his overdose death. I remember the people who got trampled to death at the Who concert in 1978, thinking “WTF is wrong with these people?” My great-grandfather, a WWI veteran, just shook his head contemptuously and muttered “Ah, goddamnit” in his Polish accent.The military as completely debased by the Vietnam debacle, the only people who joined the Army in the mid-1970s were unable to do anything else. The failed attempt to rescue the Iranian hostages made the military a laughingstock.Carter’s incompetence was on display every day, from the hostage crisis to the rabbit incident to the economy. The lefty-environment-climate nutjobs were in ascendant, from Carter wearing a sweater and telling people to turn down their thermostats to the shitbox cars to the 55mph national speed limit to “save gas.”The nutjob Jewish feminists and black racial activists were grabbing all the headlines, and the popular culture was decidedly leftist. The Weather Underground and the SLA and the Baader-Meinhof gang were all out there doing crazy shit. Merle Haggard really captured the right-wing zeitgeist with “Are the Good Time Really Over for Good?” and “Rainbow Stew.”The number of similarities between the left-wing crazies of the 1970s and today are really substantial. The difference, of course, is that back then the crazies were still largely the Counterculture, today they are the Establishment. There was a definite sense of optimism on the Right that this was temporary, it was an aberration, and if we mobilized we could vote our way out of the insanity. And to an extent, we did.There are many valid criticisms of Reagan and the “conservative” movement of the 1980s, but nonetheless it was a palpable improvement over the 1970s, and the era of sanity and prosperity prevailed into the 1990s. Clinton and his wife were continually forced to moderate their positions and pay lip service to the obvious success of the Right.But that was a temporary victory. Reagan and the Right simply kicked the can down the road, they never buried the Left. Leviathan continued to grow, demographics continued to disfavor whites, and the Leftist nutjobs slowly gained control of every institution.The difference between 1979 and 2023 is that we now realize that this is permanent, we can no longer correct the situation, and that an implosion is unavoidable.

                My grandfather had a Buick with a loud annoying buzzer that would sound continuously if you went over 55. He was getting old and his hearing was going, so it wasn’t long after he bought it that he couldn’t hear the buzzer anymore, and would drive along at 60 or so with that buzzer going BZZZZZZZZZZ. Wasn’t really any point telling him, we just tolerated it.

                    I remember when they went from 120 to 100 MPH. For GM it appears to have been the 1974 model year. I had a 1976 de Ville where the speedometer topped out at 100. A online look at a 1973 showed 120. Didn’t stop me from foolishly burying the speedometer. And kinesthetic feedback told me the car was still accelerating.By 1977 for GM cars at least, the speedometer was limited to 85 MPH. Some cars had 55 MPH either highlighted or circled. I know since I looked at a 1977 de Ville before I bought my 1976 and it was limited to 85.Here’s photographic proof:1976:https://cdn.dealeraccelerate.com/saratoga/3/692/14347/1920×1440/1976-cadillac-deville1977:https://cdn.dealeraccelerate.com/chicago/1/4/23581/1920×1440/1977-cadillac-sedan-devilleThank goodness THAT crap is over.

                True, The Brougham Epoch (As CurbsideClassic.com puts it) had its Ugly Ducklings with the upright, rigid, “Neo-Classical” styling (Note the proliferation of upright central grills in cars of that era. Stolen from the classics of the 1920s-30s), and it wore poorly in some crapwagons like the Granada/Monarch, Aspen/Volare sedans, and some of the downsized GM Mid-Sizers. And the less said about the AMC Gremlin and Pacer the better (Unless you’re Wayne and Garth).But, to each his own, I’d love to have my first car, a mid 1970s Coupe de Ville back (not exactly the beat to death piece of junk I bought, but a much better treated and running example), one of my eldest brother’s Lincoln Mark IVs, a big ol’ Full Sized Fuselage (1969-73) or Brougham-ed out (1974-78) Chrysler Corporation ride, or even my uncle’s late 1970s Buick Park Avenue or the dream car my father never got, a fully loaded late 1970s Cadillac Sedan de Ville.Why? Compared to today, with the homogenized, sterilized, bubble wrapped for your protection, smoothed for efficiency “personal transportation” pods, those cars had class. They had presence. Yeah, they guzzled unleaded like a wino going after a jug of MD 20-20 but they rode down the road like a dream and handled bumps with the slightest of impact. Nowadays with the overtuned sport suspensions the few cars you can find have you can run over a quarter on the street and it feels like you’re offroading over rocks and gullies.De gustibus and all that. And besides, look at what cars shrunk to in the 1980s. 🤦‍♂️

        “The growth in domestic supply has stopped. New investment is in decline as a result, so the decline in domestic supply will continue.”
Peter Zeihan said this 2 days ago: “US shale has been expanding in leaps and bounds over the last several months and years, especially since covid started to let up and it’s nearing record levels and it’s only gonna go up from here…”

                That he is. But many people listen to him. And whether US shale production is growing or not and whether it’s nearing records should be verifiable. I suspect that both, Zeihan and Z-man rely on secondary sources. Can someone here point me to an actual/official dataset showing the state of US shale production?

                On that last item – the percentage of gays among the “creative class” seems higher to me nowadays than even the oft-cited 10% (which of course is probably only true in big cities which concentrate them). I think what might be going on in many cases is that AA is applied more aggressively to gays because they can usually at least do the actual job they were hired for. So if you’ve got to pick from three people, one an outstanding normal White heterosexual, one a mediocre White gay, and one a sub-par diversity, you pick the White faggot every time. Then when they call you raciss, you just wave a rainbow flag and they have to shut up. Not everyone can be a one-legged black lesbian midget after all.

            Shale is literally the best windfall this country has seen in decades.  It’s also the reason natural gas prices were reduced to pennies above transportation costs.  Right now, because we’re the stupid country, with stupid, degenerate leadership, all kinds of EPA schemes are working their way through to hobble it out of existence.  As we hit our economic and energy crisis, I predict that we will reverse course on this.  But let’s they they’re SO stupid that they don’t (because mother Earth).  This issue alone would be grounds for a “Texit” from the U.S.

                I’ve read in various places that shale (tight) oil has been a money losing proposition since day 1. I have not heard the same thing about shale gas though.  OTOH, it’s hard to imagine people just keep pumping money into a money losing project.Frankly, anyone shipping gas or oil overseas should be arrested as a traitor.  Fossil fuels are a one time gift of nature which cannot be replaced.  Not only is it giving away our inheritance, it harms us because the price we pay becomes subject to world market conditions. Why should foreigners in foreign places be able to bid up the price I have to pay for gas/oil?   For any producer saying that without exports, prices are too low for them to make money, that’s complete malarkey. Stop producing so much, “problem” solved.People should remember that just before the gas “shale revolution,” conventional gas had just peaked and prices were rapidly rising.

            He is one of those guys who uses the tricks of fortune tellers. For example, “expanding in leaps and bounds over the last several months and years” can mean anything. Expanding over the last few months could mean a blip, while years implies long term strategy, but then he throws in the Covid business which contradicts that.  Then there is this:https://www.ft.com/content/26bd3376-c4b4-4257-98e1-93b29706d2d8and this:https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/shale-rd-cuts-cast-shadow-future-us-oil-production-2023-05-25/

                From what I recall shale/fracking only ever worked in a declining interest rate environment so that poor cost-to-product ratio could be pushed out into the future indefinitely (“indefinitely” turned out to be sometime last year).
It was always iffy as fracking is the equivalent of scraping the last bit of ice cream out of the tub with a spatula.

        The policies of the 1960s were the underpinning of many of the problems we face. After the Vietnam “conflict” most people who had a heartbeat began to realize the US wasn’t that good ol’ Uncle Sam after all. The 70s were an attempt to block out the distasteful memories of the 60s.We had a ’71 Dodge Polara two-door, avocado green with a black vinyl roof. 360CI V8. Cloth and vinyl interior with the (factory) air conditioner hanging below the dashboard. Cruising at 75 on the interstate, one got the sensation of levitating at high speed rather than rolling over the pavement – on polyester belted tires. And yet we survived.

Well maybe.
Not sure avocado Corning ware or (worse) melamine crockery ever looked great.
Burnt Orange all is forgiven!

                Looked at buying my first house in the mid 1990s and the realtor took me to a mid-1970s era split level in my price range. It hadn’t been updated (save for paint) since the home was built.
It had the original green shag carpeting from the 1970s. It looked like they gutted and skinned Oscar the Grouch and put his hide on the floor.

        Taking a minute to appreciate the comment section here. Even if not a single one is correct, it is great that at least every one discusses real things that really matter and that take into account real things that once really happened. I am not saying that not a comment is correct either. Just saying, thank you everyone who comes here for being a serious person. We have to keep our heads high no matter what.If the terry cloth pant suit at the gas station was bad, well at least it was on a smoking hot Nordic descendant surrounded by Chads no matter how poorly dressed.I shudder to think of the fatties in onesies covered in tats and punched full of holes.Keep fit. Keep healthy. Keep positive. Stay attractive and above all stay serious. Thanks folks!

            Unpopular opinion, but kind of like the 1970s. I like the hair, the interior design (as long as it was on the MCM side and not the Liberace side), and especially the films and music. Artistically, the 1970s were the height of American pop culture.
I also miss how decades could be pinpointed by a mere photograph or video. Show me a photo now, and I couldn’t tell you if it was 2003, 2013, or 2023. Before the turn of the century, you KNEW what ridiculous decade the sample was taken from.

                    I don’t know.  I found Midnight Cowboy and Saturday Night Fever and a number of other iconic 70s films to be tawdry and depressing.   Kind of like the 70s themselves…
But, yea, a heck of a lot better than the last ten years and, no doubt, the next ten to come…

                70s music was awesome, even a lot of what gets called disco. But I admit the worst disco was pretty bad.
The 60s basically ruined fashion.  In the time before that, even homeless people dressed better than we do today.  Their suit might have been dirty and had holes in it, but they were suits.  Pretty much all men wore hats and nice shoes too. A respectable man wouldn’t be caught dead in a pair of gym shoes anywhere but the gym.

                    Disco lyrics were completely inane, but the instrumental aspects of the music were actually quite appealing. That music was smooth with a driving rhythm that really did compel one to dance. Rap, disco’s negroid successor, simply makes one want to commit violence. And that, I’m sure, is its primary purpose.

                If you like those shaggy, floppy male hair styles from the 70s, all you need to do is stroll across a college campus for a reprise. Everything old is new again.
And you’re quite correct about the bland, aesthetic homogeneity of the 21st century, although I think it extends all the way back into the 90s. From the standpoint of visual design aesthetics, there’s not all that much difference between 1993 and 2023. On the other hand, the disparity between 1993 and 1983 is stunning.

                    The globohomo illustration style of the early ’90s is very similar to today’s. I don’t think they’ve even bothered changing the name of it from “Memphis” to something new. But there has been a visible degeneration, from something like “corporate notebook doodle” (e.g., the now-famous “jazz” cups) to a visual propaganda so uniform it really looks like *nobody* made it (distorted vector people of indeterminate non-whiteness). The former evocation of the hand-drawn was a false welcome, but today’s Google blob people are intentionally alienating. A state surveillance company—as almost every company is—dressed in the comic misproportions and garish colors of children’s drawings is consciously mocking you.

        Last week, a documentary about race car drivers from the early 70’s was playing on one of the televisions at the gym. It is a film called “Stewart” about Jackie Stewart and I highly recommend it, if only for the images from the past. It was a bit before my time and I have zero interest in car racing but it was extraordinary. The footage from the early 70’s was absolutely incredible. Yes, the clothing style was strange and goofy but everyone was white. The drivers, all the fans in the crowd, and the commentators were all white. It was a different world. At one point, they were boarding a plane and the announcement was “please, if you do smoke, cigarettes only.” Everyone looked healthy and happy. They seemed thoughtful and had conversations about immortality. It was such a stark contrast from all the other screens showing the present day trash. The silly barbie movie crap, the black sports guys telling the masses to eat the goyslop, the black women astronauts. Even the ridiculous animated commercials are all dark.We can’t go back, nor should we want to because the trajectory was already in place well before then. But it is really remarkable to see that alien civilization. It may not have been a paradise but it is all lost.

            Bingo!  I’d jump in a time machine and wear those goofy clothes–hell I did–immediately if it would free me from today’s fantasy world of Black superiority.Example, there is a series on Netflix, “Lincoln Lawyer” which has a White guy as the lawyer hero.  Yet, every character in the justice system is a high level Black and most of the “bad guys” in the system are White.  Not only are the numbers bizarrely disproportional, but reality of course is the exact opposite!

                There was a point around the beginning of the Reagan presidency where judges began to be portrayed by women and minorities.  It started slowly, there was still Judge Wapner andNight Court, but it started to gain momentum and a decade or so later, judges were almost always depicted as having the “wisdom” that white men can never know.

            The leadership of NASCAR are a bunch of anti-White SJWs.  But the fans keep letting them get away with evil, like just recently suspending a driver because he liked a George Floyd meme making fun of him and the Bubba Wallace noose scam.  This is insane.  NASCAR fans might be 1% black on a good day.I imagine some of it comes from (((NY))) advertising agencies running to Ford and GM kvetching about their brands.  Not to mention their support of the pervert community and pedophile community.  You can’t enjoy nuttin without these freaks making it all about them.  Everything it touches is poisoned.

            Well, I ‘am’ a devotee of automobile racing, and particularly the history of open-wheel racing, and I can tell you that if you enjoyed “Stewart” you should check out the 1966 film Grand Prix. Basically, it’s a soap opera on wheels, but it is also an artistically gorgeous movie that accurately captures the parlous, romantic nature of F1 racing in the 60s. And, needless to say, nary a negro to be seen.PS–Even Ron Howard’s Rush, which came out several years ago, is well worth seeing. It focuses on the rivalry between Nikki Lauda and James Hunt–to very different men–over the course of the dramatic 1976 F1 season.

                It’s not a work of fiction, but there’s a youtube video shot back in the day documenting the Cummins diesel entry into the world of auto racing.  The name of the video is “Diesel Race Car. Diesel Indy Car 1952. Cummins Diesel.” (with the period).  It’s pretty cool. I thought it was pretty interesting.  They even set a record for fastest lap time, IIRC, in the qualifying runs.

                    Yes, the Kurtis / Cummins Diesel Special (Chassis maker / engine) did set a track record with a 138 MPH average with a 1 lap record of 139 MPH (Qualifying for the 500 is four laps) and won the Pole Position for the 1952 Indianapolis 500. It was the first turbocharged car to race at Indianapolis and the last diesel powered car to do so. Turns out to get a hope in Hell of aerodynamics and reduced drag, Frank Kurtis the chassis builder laid that big ol’ inline Cummins diesel engine flat on its side.Alas, aside from the car being very heavy and wearing out tires, laying the engine over on its side put the turbocharger intake at the track level. Which meant it worked like a 130+ MPH vacuum cleaner. The turbo scooped up so much dirt and junk it clogged and that was that.Fascinating stuff from back when racing allowed innovation:https://youtu.be/0zdSnlnazlY

                    Yes. IIRC, that diesel ran the entire race without having to pit. But it was a much heavier and slower machine than the frontrunners, which is why it didn’t finish high up in the money.

            Everyone looked healthy and happy. They seemed thoughtful and had conversations about immortality. It was such a stark contrast from all the other screens showing the present day trash.Thanks for the mention of the Jackie Stewart documentary. The early 1970s were a changing point for auto racing. Prior to this death was an expected part of the game. Designers and engineers aimed to go faster first, and safety was sometimes a secondary consideration, if that. When television brought racing into people’s living rooms, seeing cars and drivers slam into walls or other cars and people getting seriously injured or killed horrified viewers. Jackie was a part of the push for increased safety standards, which is good in that it allows drivers to live longer and earn more money. On the other hand a lot of the innovation and increase in speed isn’t there.With the rise of television racing became more corporate. Sponsors now call more of the shots over hiring and retaining drivers, and on the Formula 1 side you have mind-boggling budgets directed at a bunch of computer geeks who are desperately looking at shaving a fraction of a second off a lap. The cars are safer yet ugly as sin since they’re computer designed and not craftsman designed. Sadly most races these days are decided by the first turn of the first lap.On the IndyCar and NASCAR side the product stagnates since the money that used to be there isn’t there and the sanctioning bodies aren’t really interested in advancing the tech. IndyCar is fine with a car that’s basically been around since 2012, nipped and tucked with some bits and bobs, but at Indianapolis the track records for 1 and 4 lap qualifying have stood since 1996. NASCAR is all about putting on a good “Show” for the rubes in the top row (same as it ever was 🙄) when they’re not banning drivers for their social media accounts.It’s a trade off: Racing is safer (It’ll never be 100% safe) at the cost of increasing speeds, real innovation, and drivers with differing personalities. Kinda like the rest of the world now.

                The most important element of racing that has been lost in the monomaniacal safety push is the sport’s heroic element. Prior to the sanitization of racing, people worshiped drivers almost as gods because what they did was incredibly dangerous and difficult. Mere mortals would never get behind the wheel of an Offy-powered monster with skinny wheels, minimal suspension, no roll bars and sans fire suits, surrounded by gasoline, and go careening around Langhorne with 20 other daredevils.The safety push has made racing mundane. Drivers are no longer heroic figures; they’re corporate automatons who mouth the expected pieties, and they’re modestly talented automatons devoid of masculinity at that. Racing simply does not have the tang and tone that it once did. But hey, it’s safe, and that’s all that really matters.

        The big one is the increasing debt, who and what reins it in? I don’t think there is a who, there is no leader or ruling class to rein it in so that leaves the what. The what may more than likely be either a sovereign debt crisis or a war. It is indeed going to be worse than the 70’s, no roaring 80’s are coming.

            It’s mostly too late to reign in the deficits. Fed gov spending is ~25% now. If average deficits are running at two to five percentage points above nominal GDP growth, i.e., that’s how much debt to GDP grows in an average year, you’d need to cut spending or raise taxes by 2 to 5 percent of GDP.That would crash the economy and make the situation even worse. That’s exactly what happened to Greece ten years ago and they’ve never recovered.The only hope (and don’t laugh at how impossible this is) would be  for both parties to get together and come up with a 10-15 plan to slowly cut spending and raises taxes. This would solve the problem gradually so as to keep the economy from tanking.The bond market would have to take Congress at its word that they would stick to this plan.That will never happen. Hell, Congress isn’t even talking about the debt issue because it’s never been a problem before. Remember all those morons in the 1980s and 90s saying the debt would be a problem and nothing happened, they say.And they’re probably right for awhile. As long as the bond market keeps buying treasuries (or gilts or European gov bonds) the plates will stay in the air.

This would solve the problem gradually so as to keep the economy from tanking.”This has been proposed since Reagan.  Closest it has come has been to raise taxes first (done immediately), then cut spending (never done).  The people–no matter how stupid–are wise to this.The only way to regain credibility is an immediate, significant, cut.  Say 5%.  Then to allow a fiscal year to pass and report success.  Then possibly reduce cuts to a manageable rate and follow up with manageable tax increases.

                    By far the most simple way to fix the problem – and this will never, ever happen – is to allow gov spending to increase at a pace of inflation minus one percentage point.
It would be gradual and predictable. Again, will never happen. Indeed, will never even be considered.

                        compsci,
I agree, but if we did what was needed, we’d crash the economy. Cutting spending or raising taxes by 2 to 4 percent of GDP would send us into a very, very deep recession which would cause govt spending to explode, revenues to collapse and GDP to tank, all of which would make the debt to GDP problem worse.

                        Citizen, that’s been said since Reagan era.  Can’t do it, too harsh, calamity, etc.–and here we are today and there you are proposing the same old, same old.  And to boot, saying the course correction won’t/can’t happen politically.  So just what are you saying?  You want your cake and eat it too?
Gradualism does not take into account the corrupt pol’s we have in power, who will undermine such agreement at first chance.  That’s why I simply refuse to start there.  5% doesn’t touch the fat in all government agencies.  Let the rotten system fail if it comes to that.

I’m not disagreeing with you. What I proposed will never happen. That doesn’t mean that it’s not the best path in theory. What you’re proposing will never happen either.
What’s going to happen is the system will crash. Now, how hard the crash will be and what form it will take is unknowable.

                Deficits will not and can not be reined in as long as the dollar remains the reserve currency. It’s called the Triffin Dilemma, and it applies to all countries whose currency serves as a  reserve currency. Deficit spending is necessary to supply the world with the reserve currency they need to use to conduct business.The cycle breaks when it becomes apparent to the rest of the world that the host nation can no longer repay the debt. Historically, reserve currencies tend to last 100-200 years, and that has been with governments far more responsible than the US government. Given the gross irresponsibility of our FedGov, the end is probably near, and that’s a good thing for most of us here. Those of us with assets will likely lose most of our wealth, but it will give us the opportunity to restart the system, hopefully with the US broken into multiple, smaller countries.

                    The petrodollar ensured that we’d run big trade deficits with countries that need to import a lot of energy, i.e., countries with a big manufacturing based. This guaranteed that our manufacturing base would be gutted.
It’s why China doesn’t want to have the global reserve currency, not that it could it if wanted for a variety of reasons.

            The US has been playing an unsound game, betting money it doesn’t have, since the 1970s…Now, some big players are calling our bluffs…Some kind of default is inevitable, but my guess is that the Treasury will keep printing money and the Fed will buy the bonds, until its real owners, the big banks, call a halt to the proceedings….

            The big one is the increasing debt, who and what reins it in? I don’t think there is a who, there is no leader or ruling class to rein it in so that leaves the what.
When it comes to the debt. My big question is “How”? I see no workable solution. Fiscal colapse appears to be the solution to the debt, planned or otherwise.

        I’d argue that the current issues are more like the 1940s than the 1970s, though they share attributes of both and some new wrinkles.In the 40s, deficit spending was largely responsible for the growth in the money supply while in the 70s, it was bank lending. That’s the same today.In the 40s, debt to GDP hit 120% while in the 1970s, it was only 30%.Finally, the 40s was hit by a severe supply shock due to the war while in the 1970s, their was the oil embargo and the Boomer entering the workforce.In many ways, we’re about to get hit by a combination of the 40s and 70s with a few more problems thrown in.In the 40s, debt went crazy and the supply chain was disrupted but there was an end to the spending and the supply chain issues with the end of the war. In addition, the economy had a highly skilled workforce that led to huge economic growth going forward.Today, the federal spending is just beginning and we can expect slow economic growth.In the 70s, debt was extremely low allowing the Fed to raise rates. Also, the economy adjusted to the oil embargo and Boomers by finding new sources of oil, becoming more energy efficient and slowly adjusting to the Boomers who were also a highly skilled workforce that set up the country for solid growth going forward.Today, regulations and govt threats don’t incentivize capex in energy and the young workforce is terrible.I suspect that we’re staring down the barrel of the first sovereign debt crisis in the developed world in 100 years. The debt in the US, Europe, UK and Japan is too high for the expected growth. That worked so long as inflation stayed low allowing interest rates to also stay extremely low.Once inflation showed up, problems started to arise. If inflation can’t be brought down and forced to stay down, those short-term problems will eventually crash the whole system.Developed market govts can’t afford higher interest rates. Either those rates are kept near zero by extremely low inflation or by govts forcing those rates to stay near zero, i.e., yield curve control, i.e., money printing or forcing investors to buy negative real yield bonds.What we’re facing makes the 70s look easy.

        “Nixon taking the dollar off the gold standard gets the blame for inflation, but in reality, it was the interplay of energy and the dollar that caused the problem. The reason we have the petrodollar is to solve the inflation problem.”Never was so much understanding packed into so few words. You’ve stressed the link between the dollar and fossil fuel. But there’s a third element to the triad: military power. Recall that it was Kissinger’s over threat of military intervention that caused the gulf states to acquiesce to the petrodollar (which meant selling their oil for dollars and then parking their money in Wall Street banks). The USA’s military power is not that intimidating any more as there are other kids on the block. It cannot now militarily enforce the dollar standard.There are other issues as well, which go beyond US blunders in grand strategy. One is — here goes — peak oil. Peak global conventional oil probably arrived in 2005 and peak oil (including unconventional) probably in 2018. It’s all downhill from here. Everyone — not just the USA — is going to have to tighten their belts. The particular problem for the USA is that it has painted itself into a corner of high oil consumption, without any plan for the morrow. Not much of any rail links, not much urban mass transit either (outside the northeast). An economy that is vitally dependent on gasoline and diesel.A couple of quick references. One is Alice Friedemann’s “When Trucks Stop Running.” The other is Gail Tverberg’s most recent post (in fact all her posts):https://ourfiniteworld.com/2023/08/03/our-oil-predicament-explained-heavy-oil-and-the-diesel-fuel-it-provides-are-key/Oh, and a recent post by Tim Watkins is also insightful:https://consciousnessofsheep.co.uk/2023/07/19/our-predicament-re-stated/I think one way of viewing the USA is that its ossified and calcified political system is a mirror reflection of its ossified and calcified economic system. Radical economic changes should have been made decades ago. Now there’s nothing left save slogans (“Build Back Better”) and trying to restore US hegemony even at the risk of all-out war.

            I have always been a “peak oil” skeptic because like affordable solar power, the peak is always a decade in the future. That said, there is a peak somewhere, so the world will need other options. The thing is, there is an option that is available. The world has a thousand year supply of natural gas. The technology to make liquid fuels like diesel and gasoline from gas have been around for a long time. The Nazis make diesel from cola gas. The issue is price, but that is going to be overcome in the near future.This is something that gets missed. The real fight in the Middle East is about control of the massive gas fields. The current Russian and Chinese diplomatic efforts in the region are about resolving the issues between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey and so on in order to deny the West (Washington) control of the natural gas fields and the pipelines.

Indeed, and to have a low price you have to have low debt.  Funny how its all a giant circle like a snake eating its own tail.  The debt will either default at some point in the near future or it will hyperinflate.  Both are the same really when you think about it.  Low prices but no money or insanely high prices but not enough money.  This is where Klaus and globalists believe they can save themselves with CBDCs.

                zman:  While there is an enormous supply of natural gas, that is precisely what the other side has targeted.  No new gas stoves or water heaters.  Even wood stoves (when permitted)  must now have circulating fans . .. which require electricity.  It is all designed to ensure that the shrinking White population has a lower standard of living (their ‘fair share’) and absolute dependence on corporations and the government.Any independence – of thought or word or deed  – is to be rendered forbidden.  Thus my concerns re well pumps and propane tanks – I’m not just a right-wing conspiracy theorist nutjob.  I want to ensure some degree of self reliance before even the thought of such is strangled in the cradle and legislated out of existence.  Supply is not the most vital part of the equation any longer – it is availability, by hook or by crook, via the black market or  hard currency or barter or favors or influence.

                Yes. This is akin to the Great Game, and the US is on the losing side of the Game. We toss military bases across the map like pawns on the chess board, believing that these bases equate to influence. But those bases are utterly useless once the worm turns. Witness Niger.For those of us of a certain age, it is astounding to watch major peace negotiations taking place in the middle east that are led by China and/or Russia, and the US doesn’t have a place at the table. Our recent military fiascos, coupled with the diplomatic train wreck that was the Khashoggi affair, has really come back to bite us in the arse.Our credentialed managerial elite are by and large historically illiterate, and are in no way, shape, or form up to the task of competing strategically for influence in the world. Mark Steyn has written and spoken eloquently about the lack of substantive knowledge among the elites of the modern West for the last two decades. I suspect that the elites know this and it is one of the reasons they have thrown open the borders to immigration. The native white population of America (and the UK) would have demanded leadership that is better than our current crop of elites can supply. Rather than allowing themselves to be replaced by more competent elites, they have imported a nation of dummies who don’t know enough to demand better.

                Let’s not forget you can run ICE motors on natural gas. I bought a small block Chevy out of a National Fuel Gas  company truck in my early Hot Rodder days,  that was the cleanest engine I’d ever seen. No carbon deposits in the heads or intake manifold. The northeast where I live is a natural gas gold mine.

            A large portion of gasoline consumption is commuting.  With a “work from home” mandate and an economy that makes it largely possible, the GAE could stagger through an oil crunch for  a while longer.

                When the oil embargo hit, there were many alternatives popping up.  For example, our biggest employers, Raytheon and IBM hired private busses to pick up workers.  Today we have not just the Internet, but the possibility of EV’s for commute.  I’m not so worried in that regard.

        So much to choose from in today’s essay:…”this version of the 1970’s will bring us far worse things than denim leisure suits and velour car interiors”… I was there at the time, and yeah – it was bad.  I think I could live with that again, but the long hair &amp; side burns, Fu Man Chu moustache’s – they’re a bridge too far.As for energy policy, while mere incompetence is bad enough – yet that we might survive – rather it is the directed undermining and veritable sabotage of our energy system by the Green / Cloud (post turtle) people that will make a significant contribution to the wreck of AINO ship of state.  The result: less energy, higher cost, and a larger carbon footprint to boot.(Longfellow poem – Wreck of the Hesperus – came to mind as an allegory)

        ” Led by the Saudis, the oil producing countries have aligned themselves with their most dependable partners, Russia and China…”——————————————Point of order – I am not an economist… but… The Saudis – like all arabs, will change their alliances more regularly than they change their underwear. China will too. As will we. When the Almighty Buck is in play… we’re all whores.But from what I am seeing of Western central banks  – there are a LOT of jewish faces involved, and there is a LOT of coin clipping going on with our financial policies. I notice that historically – the second Hitler punted the jews out of his finances his country literally exploded off the starting blocks in the economic sense. Putler did the same, and now he’s making money hand over fist. As are China and the Saudis who seem to be strangely antisemitic in this regard.But I’m sure it’s all a coincidink, and I am just being hateful and bigoted.

                We (America) sits on an 800 year supply of coal.  That can be converted to liquid fuel to supply the present rolling stock.  Nuclear *is* viable as well.  There is no shortage of energy (in various forms), there is a shortage of *will* to utilize what we have.  This is the most observable failure of “democracy” as a system of government–the failure in a crisis to implement successful policy.  Soon we will feel the affect of the second failure–a dysgenic society unable to support its present infrastructure within its “smart fraction”.

                        But we don’t have to replace *all* of it.  We have our own supplies of oil.  We merely replace the shortfall.  As prices increase, alternatives (e.g., EV’s) become more attractive.  The point here is not that energy becomes cheaper, but that it can be provided in a usable form and somewhat timely fashion.

        “The one thing missing from this picture is brown leisure suits.”
It’s amazing to realize that those hideous clothes indicated a people that took pride in their appearance. Today the people would wearing pajamas at the gas station.
Niger and the African realignment seems pretty big. We really are ramping up for seismic shifts.

            Africa will be interesting. If their leaders finally prioritize the people over individual enrichment, then dominoes probably start to fall.
Niger could be a flash in the pan or it could be a catalyst. I still don’t expect them to cure cancer, but semi functional governments and economies could be possible.  The West will try to fight that in secret and hope to keep the status quo.

                    Niger kicked out France. My guess is Russia will support them.  As for how malevolent Russia is, that’s to be seen.  I don’t see them imposing Afghan levels of control. My guess is they are pushing to destabilize EU energy.

        “When someone wants to produce images that are supposed to capture the mood of the period, inevitably they show people in the hideous costumes of the era, standing at a gas station.”Hey, I resemble that remark!I came away from NYC in the mid-seventies thinking that we had a tiger by the tail, that there would be no escape for the nation as a whole. I spent most of my life up till the last 20 years moving restlessly from one large urban area to the next in search of the kind of lifestyle I had known in the fifties. There were little vignettes of it here and there. I finally gave up and found peace in a small town/rural setting well away from big cities, college towns, military bases, and tourist destinations. It is ironic that I face the end of my days witnessing a similar upheaval which affected me in my youth. God help us. I hope to observe this implosion from a safe distance.

            Fossil fuel phase out is to clip the wings of the majority of people. It’s about control as are CBDC, health passports, intersection security cameras, etc.    The weasels who tricked their way into court advisor roles are going to lock it all up as tight as possible.The climate bit, as were wars on terror, covidism, etc, are just pretexts to lock things up and people down, especially us people.The Mother Gaia bit is used to distract from the real culprit, the you know who.   It’s a diversion, bit of burger tossed to dogs so the theft can proceed.  As diversions go,  Mother Gaia is a good one, as it has multiple dimensions: Male vs Female;  European Metaphor vs Middle East Metaphor, deuce coup lake pipes roar vs grimy canvas sack.

Us? Not so much. Kinda like go woke, go broke; when the Wokesters, serving as cover for the authoritarians who aspire to total societal control, run the allocations and the setting of same, they will make sure that they have what they need. Hopefully, they have miscalculated about that, given their gross incompetence in real world concerns, and it will crash and burn. But not right away.

I understand your point, but my belief is that it is open to debate.
I say that because there seem to be plenty among those in charge who honestly seem to believe that so-called renewables can fully replace natural gas, coal, oil, diesel, etc.

            Tykebomb:  That’s definitely my motto – I haven’t used those exact words but I have shared the intent behind them.  Buy it now – it will either become more expensive or become unavailable.  You’re losing money daily due to inflation – don’t leave it in the failing banks – spend it on something tangible and useful.
And it IS all getting worse – by the day.

            Ref Tykebomb comment: “it’s only going to get worse”.On the one hand – that would be proof of the axiom.On the other hand and on second thought – if disco rid us of hip-hop, rap, or whatever passes for pop music nowadays – I’ll take disco.  (Are the Bee Gees still around)?

        &gt; The deficit is over $31 trillion, a number that is inconceivable to most people. Debt payments are now at one trillion per year.While I don’t trust insider reports much, one report that rang true was someone saying Trump admitted the deficit was an insurmountable problem, and his main goal was the financial system not collapsing on his watch. Cynical, but he would be correct, as the requirements for balancing the budget would cause such an uproar every elected official would lose their phony-baloney job.The only way out is non-democratic, probably involving massive money printing, with the associated inflation. Think Canada levels of housing inflation to keeps things running. There’s talk of this all being a plan to implement a global CBDC, but it’s more of a case of too much momentum on a bulky ship ramming into shore. Rest assured, people will use the circumstances to their advantage, but this mess isn’t by design.

            Does any Gen-Xer really think they’ll collect a dime of Social Security?Reading about annual debt payment of $1 trillion/yr, it’s hard not to imagine that even the huge bloc of voting boomers might take a haircut. Drop the COLA at the least, delay collection age, means test it, or, and this is a fantasy…….no Social Security for anyone. If I paid more than most into it than everyone else and get nothing, how about you don’t either?How about no Medicare after 75, while we’re at it.Needs must when devil’s drive, as the saying goes.A man can dream.

                    Partially correct.  SSI has its own source of funding, so that is/will be divided among the recipients proportionally.  Several unknowns at this time however.  Inflation adjustments to SSI–will they be cut back?  Will Congress change the law and cut back SSI on higher SES recipients and give to hold harmless lower SES recipients.  Will unemployment climb to third world levels and the SSI income decline even further?

                Last-wave Gen-Xer here (b. 1980), and no, I don’t think I’ll ever see a dime of my Social Security payments. I have had tens of thousands of dollars stolen from me to support aged and unaged welfare queens, and to fund a fantasy that never should have been dreamt.And it’s not only Social Security. The blast of forced redemptions from 401(k)s will put enormous selling pressure stocks, which will tank the markets. I do not offer financial advice, but anyone with money in one of those things might want to think about just taking the penalty and cashing out now.

                    If you were born in 1980, that means you are a quintessential millennial. The millennials came of age around the turn of the century, hence the name. The rule of thumb is first wave boomers came of age in the sixties and early seventies. Second wave boomers came of age in the seventies and early eighties. Gen-X came of age in the 80’s and early nineties. Millennials came of age around the turn of century into the aughts. We seem to have lost control of the labels at this time as millennial started to mean young people. Now we are seeing it with Zoomers, which counts those in their twenties with those in grammar school.

                        That is the first I have ever heard it classified that way.  Always heard it referred to by birth year, not “came of age” year.  A generational span of 20 some-odd years is also not unusual.    In fact, I might argue for a wider ranges as family formation (and hence, the next generation) doesn’t seem to kick in until late 20s/early 30s, if that.

                            Pedantic people like to make hard lines with this stuff, but the only reason we care about generational stuff is the cultural framework. A man born in 1950 lived a different youth and young adulthood than a man born in 1960. Calling both of them boomers misses the only point worth getting. Regardless, if you are born in 1980, you are not Gen-X. You are the archetype of the millennial generation, hence the name.
This is why I hate generational politics.

                            You see the problem with generational labels. A man born in 1901 probably served in the Great War or had siblings who served. The man born in 1924 was probably the first guy’s son and he was not alive during the war, but he probably served in the Second World War. How are they in the same generation? You can do the same thing with Boomers. The Boomer born in 1950 has experienced a totally different America that the Boomer born in 1964.That is why using the coming of age-cultural metric makes more sense. People who were in their teens in the 80’s and 90’s can relate to my cultural outlook, becasue we shared the same world as we entered adulthood. The guy born in 1980 cannot know what it was like to be in school in the Reagan or Bush years, wearing a knit tie and listening to Flock of Seagulls.

                        Ackshually before the main millennial group there is a smaller group usually referred to as xennials.  The people born in the early 80s who  grew up with home computers but no internet until their teenage years.  This actually composes the bulk of the “younger” (I mean we’re hitting our 40s now…) anti-woke people online, since they were already into adulthood when all the sjw crap started and not all of them got brainwashed.In fact, I remember back in college.  I had an onion on my belt which was the fashion at the time, but the socially conscious students were still typically made fun of by the dominant dudebros for talking like fags and having their shit all fucked up.  They hadn’t yet metastasized into the struggle session cultural revolution cadres, that was later on in the 2010s.

                        True story, Ploppy! I’ve also heard ‘us’ referred to as the Oregon Trail generation. Fun game.
Like riding the crest of a wave. In that way I can relate to the oldest boomers: being educated and trained for this new world, and as you’re ready to enter it, it turns out to be this shitty thing instead of what you were told.
Damned if I won’t overcome it, though, or go down resisting to the last.

                        I go with this simplified generational classification and IMO it’s as good as any other. It’s easier to think in terms of decades rather than mid-decade dividing line, and it makes it easy to see the differences in each generational half. Of course the boundaries are soft:
Greatest: 00’s-10’sSilent: 20’s-30’sBoomers: 40’s-50’sGenXers: 60’s-70’sMillennials: 80’s-90’sZoomers: 00’s-10’s

                        Ploppy and Paintersforms.Yes, regardless of what the generational tables say, those of us born in 1980 will never relate to the true Millennials. We are quite different. Strauss and How extend Generation X until 1983 and I am inclined to agree with them.Even though 1980 doesn’t seem that long ago, I am old enough to remember a time when a few people still unironically used rotary phones and watched black and white TVs. Fewer years elapsed between the beginning of WWII and the year of my birth than between my birth and the present day. Even as late as high school, I still wrote a lot of my essays out in longhand.These experiences just aren’t compatible with the Millennial mindset.

Unvarnished truth here. 401k’s have been low-hanging fruit a long, long time but it isn’t too late yet to do just as you suggested. It is a reasonable guess the penalties for cashing out conveniently will increase in the near term.

                    “The blast of forced redemptions from 401(k)s will put enormous selling pressure stocks, which will tank the markets.”As to my previous comment, you are wrong on SSI.As to above, you are also wrong–here’s why.When one redeems funds for a 401K, what does one do with them?  Basically–one of two things, spend it or invest it.If you spend it, why?  If for expenses, then you’d have withdrawn the funds in any event–not just because you are required to at a certain age.  if you spend it, you are contributing to the economy as well.If you don’t need it, you will take the cash and turn around and invest it.  You can, as I do, simply put it back into the market.  Hell, I don’t even see the cash–it all go back minus the tax bite.And when my wife and I die, the 401k goes to the (millennial) children who will most likely retain it as an investment in the market since they don’t need it.  But even should they spend their “windfall”, this too improves the economy and a good economy shows up in the market.

                        Sir, I am referring to other factors that your analysis does not consider.
1) Once the selling pressure gets started it is only going to accelerate. It will be right regular stock market crash and people willhaveto sell their 401(k)s if they hope to get any value out of them at all.
2) People are going to need that money, at whatever penalty, just to help service their existing debts in a rising interest rate environment.
This is why the selling will happen; we won’t really have much choice in the matter.

                    “I’ve also heard ‘us’ referred to as the Oregon Trail generation.”I suspect dying of diarrhea in that game repeatedly has prepared me for our country’s future.I don’t remember ever having to handwrite essays outside of test situations, but I do remember putting stuff on floppy disks and taking them to high school only to find that the “open classroom” concept enabled kids to break every last available computer.  Before that I remember the dot matrix printers, and the beautiful music they would make.  Probably can’t get the ribbon feed paper, typewriter ribbon, or a suitable driver for one now, but it’d be a hell of a lot nicer than the fucking HP inkjet pieces of shit that dry out every time I actually need to print and then suck five pages in and start printing halfway down one of the pages.Those were the good old days, when only intelligent children could operate computers and we could do whatever we wanted.

                    The basic problem with SSI–aside from being underfunded–is the perception of the populace that it is, or should be, able to support one in retirement.  SSI was never sold that way nor is it (on the SSI website) sold as a (sufficient) pension to retire solely upon.Rather SSI is meant to be a supplemental source of income in retirement.  Approximately 30-40% of needed income–tops!I don’t so much fault the people for this perception, I fault the government for making them so poor that they are never able to save sufficiently for their retirement in this society as they’ve shaped it.

                        Compsci:  Must strenuously disagree with you here.  You know and I know that whatever the government says is a lie – and that has always been the case, to a greater or lesser extend depending on the era and the politician.  Social Security was a ponzi scheme from the start and FDr knew it.  And he damned well did sell it as a pre paid retirement.  The very idea that one ought to be able to live – comfortably if not luxuriously – without working for a decade or more – is a fantasy. Unheard of in the history of the world (that is unless one is a brown/black rapefugee in Europe or a mestizo bussed to the heart of AINO).From the dawn of history,  you worked until you couldn’t or you died – and if you were lucky  you had some family to take care of you in your final days.  The towering hubris that we are different and somehow entitled to live on others’ labor enrages me.  And as far as it being ‘your’ money – I’ve had it deducted for years, too – but I have never lied to myself that I would have saved every penny on my own and wisely invested it to reap the economic rewards when I was old.And the fantasy that it is all funded by working people?  Not a chance.  It’s all funded by printing worthless paper.  Vlogs and blogs are full of comments bewailing the writer’s poverty – not because of government policy but because “I’m retired and live off of social security and/or disability.”  Well boo hoo.I suppose I’m a social darwinist on this issue.  It’s not up to ‘the state’ or one’s ‘fellow citizens’ to provide for one to live a life of ease for 10-20 years.  And only a tiny fraction of people anywhere any time had the wherewithal to save money for old age/retirement  – let alone the opportunity and the smarts to ‘invest’ it and reap the golden windfall.It all smacks of the entitlement mentality.  And while I generally agree with Zman re the lack of utility of generational politics, it’s a flaw of OLD PEOPLE.  Silents, greatest generation, boomer – take your pick.  But they alone, through a confluence of events (WWII, industrial economy, smart fraction, White people) were able to sustain the fantasy that they could live comfortably forever.  It was an aberration.  It is vanishing.  And good goddam riddance.

                        3g4me, nothing you’ve said contradicts me (if I’ve read correctly).SSI is an actuarially unsound program, but was arguably not so when created–as folk did not live as long.  Congress simply did not adequately re-evaluate/adjust the program as our demographic profile changed.Prepaid (it’s my money) is not mentioned by me nor really important.  The important part is that the program has a source of continuing funding for those receiving benefits and those coming into the program in the future. Inflation is mentioned by me and currently accounted for in SSI law.  BTW: None of my other retirement plans has any realistic compensation/adjustment for inflation. An era of 5% inflation will in a decade halve such income.FDR to my readings did not sell this program as a complete answer to elderly retirement, but as a helping hand for the indigent elderly–who suffered greatly in the Depression.  The SSI website even mentions the 30-40% figure for retirement income replacement.Never in my entire life (about the same length as yours) did I ever hear of SSI sold as a complete pension plan for workers, nor did I expert it to be.  And of course, it’s been at least 20 years that I’ve heard again and again folk claiming that they don’t expect SSI to be there for them.  This of course could be true, but only if Congress cancels the program, which is what the essence of my rebuttals are about.I will argue a bit about people “not planning” for their retirement.  The government is not my “nanny”.  I’m with you there.  However the government should be responsible to provide a sound economy within which people can plan for their future retirement and to live independently with a bit of dignity.  I maintain that has not happened and that is where we are today.People to often live paycheck to paycheck and retire in (semi) poverty–SSI not to the contrary.  The only difference from the depression era days seems that there is even less family to fall back upon.
