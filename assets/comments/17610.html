        Your old stinger was perfect.  The bell sounds like a fairy bell.  To paraphrase Obama, that is not who you are.

                I’m so glad. I am also glad that other readers are doing my hating on the crowd for me. Cast them into the outer darkness for the remainder of eternity.

        I laughed at the applause interlude – but after that it became irritating. I liked the clown horn and the bombs myself.
Soooo… a few pebbles are skittering down the slope before the avalanche in Europe, eh?
Eeeeexcellent.

            I figured the applause would get old, but time did not permit coming up with some other options.
I sort of liked the ding I used the first time, but the explosion remains my favorite.

                I humbly suggest the infectious guitar riff from Cheech and Chong’s old routine “Ear-ache My Eye”.  You know, the riff that keeps repeating in between such gems as “Basketball coach done kicked me off the team / (riff) / For wearing high-heeled sneakers, and acting like a QUEEEEEEEEN!!”

                The applause after the feint with the ding! was priceless. Laughed out loud! I expect a lot of the folks who complained about the explosion (not me) will be begging for it back after this week. Great troll!

        The crowd clapping is annoying as hell. I think the expression of dislike of the explosion must be an attempt at trolling the Z Man.
The folks who read this blog are not that soft.

            Agree.  I like the explosion.  1. It’s cool  2. It’s soothing like rolling thunder.  3.  It’s  over-the-top funny. 4. It’s part of the legend of Z now.  As such he has no right to change it.   None of us do.  It is a mountain unto itself.

        I really had no problem with the old stinger, but… okay.
But no more clown horn for Reason? The clown horn has become synonymous with Reason! It’s become iconic! Even their own commenters have taken to responding with “Honk! Honk!” to their delusional articles. Please reconsider!

                Please keep the clown horn…..I can now imitate the clown horn, and sometimes walk through the house clown horning, startling the Basic Husband.Keep the Explosion AND turn it down.

                Don’t miss the clown horn but do miss the explosion. Range Front Fault is right… maybe just turn it down a bit (that or I just need new car speakers as mine about rattle out of the doors when the explosion occurs). Maybe a pavlovian chime between segments?  Nit-picking a great product here, please carry on with your yeoman’s work!

            The new stinger sucks.  So bad it actually takes the overall quality down because it’s like a fake sound stage comedy. The old one was just fine.   Perhaps next time do a scientifically sound poll instead of listening to a few whiners.

                I agree, 100%. You get used to the original stinger pretty quickly, and for me, it was emblematic of the hard-hitting truth bombs the Z Man lays on us. I’m pretty sure the people complaining are the minority; stay strong Z Man, don’t lay down to the my-feelingz-hurtz crowd.

        Only 41% of Germans criticize the notion that political correctness is exaggerated?!?!
You have to admit, the political indoctrination machine in Europe is awe-inspiring in it’s efficacy.
When the Booby was recently in Prague, he chatted with a young Czech university student. He said he was originally opposed to the EU, but he’s warmed up to it since it provides programs for people like himself to travel on the EU dime promoting the EU, and get other kinds of perks.

            Again, there’s a lot of Cold War-era misconceptions out there. Big business (the “corporate right”) was never a friend of traditional-values, working class America, but so long as the USSR was perceived as a threat, and so long as Socialism was something of a threat domestically they would pretend, purely out of convenience.
Now that there’s no Cold War, now that unions have been mostly eliminated, and now that both mainstream parties are indistinguishable, corporate America can’t wait to wash the smell of the deplorables off its hands.
Corporate Europe, too.

        Regarding France, I’ve been sounding the alarm bells for years – and I’ve barely been to the country. The sickle cell test plus a recent study on baby names shows that French births are a minimum (and likely much more) of 20-25% non-sub-Saharan African Muslim and 5% to 10% sub-Saharan African. It’s baked into the pie that France will be around a third Muslim and African some day.Thrown in moderate to even low immigration and a generation or so of differing birth rates (even assuming they converge in ten or 20 years), and you’re looking at ~50% of the under-40 population of France being Muslim and/or African in 40 years.There’s no way that a 50% Muslim and African France functions as a 1st world country. I can’t imagine that we’ll even get that far.Whites in the United States will be outnumbered long before the French, but we’ll be surrounded by mostly Hispanics with some blacks and Asians thrown in the mix. Crappy but workable. The ethnic French will be surrounded by civilization killers. Crazy as it sounds, I think that it’s possible the the French are in worse shape than American whites, which is utterly stunning.

                I’m not sure how reliable that numbers are, but I used to work for an economist who said that even when the numbers aren’t 100% solid, you can still use them to see a trend as long as the numbers are being gathered the same way each year. And the trend ain’t good.I don’t know how to post this sickle cell test map so I’ll put in the link. Ile de  France, which I guess is the Paris region, went from 54% in 2005 to 60% in 2010 to 73% in 2015. All of France went from 31.5% in 2010 to 35.7% in 2013 to 38.9% in 2015.Even if this test overstates the Middle East, North African and sub-Saharan African numbers by 10% to 30%, the situation is dire and the trend unsustainable. If this trend continues for another five or ten years, France is sunk. Hell, it might be sunk now, but it’s definitely toast in a decade at this rate.http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/3473190/posts

                Infants get tested when they’re at risk, which means black or dark Mediterranean. So this is indeed a good proxy for percentage of non-French births. Paris at 68% is way beyond alarming.

                    The original study appeared in the “ultra-right wing” Journal of Clinical Pathology around 2012 and was analyzed in an article by Falko Baumgartner entitled “The Africanization of France,” a little later.  Basically, newborn babies of people of Middle East and sub-Saharan African origin are tested for sickle-cell disorder in France and the percentage of newborns subject to such testing is surprisingly high and rising.   While I’m slightly skeptical of the most recent figures showing high levels of testing, it’s certainly consistent with the population one sees on the streets in France.

            Mildly curious, I speak French, German, and Italian decently well, but it’s tiresome wending through blogs without perfect command of the languages.

        My complain about the stinger was more the disparity in volume. Your speaking voice on the podcast is really quiet so I have the volume turned up so I can hear you and the old stinger was very loud in comparison.

        Very glad to hear that the explosion stingie-thingie will return along with the clown horn. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I hated the applause. It seemed to go on forever… A more appropriate form of applause stingie-thingie might be just a second or two of “golf clapping” rather than the rousing ovation we heard this week. I’ve been trying to spread the word about the Power Hour but honestly I would have been embarrassed to send someone to this week’s episode. Still, I really enjoy the content and the shared insights so complaints about ding-tones and applause are mere nit-picking. Thanks for all your hard work.

        Don’t like the applause. Just doesn’t work, man. I find it more annoying than your trademark Reason rag clown horn, which oddly I do miss.

        I’m a no-vote on the applause stinger – stick with the original or something shorter and milder than applause.  I’m tempted to consider it a good-natured troll of Z’s critics ala Tomorrow Belongs vs. White Boy Doin’ My Thing from some time back.

        Yes….thank you Z for bringing us up to speed on the European scene, your time and efforts. I admit to being provincial, living west in a Rocky Mountain state, in a huge country…no shame in that and always open to learning more.  Appreciate you bringing a new and different Euro perspective, along with Felix and Yves and others over the great European divide. Learn from those farther down the road from us. No need to reinvent the wheel..hate wasting time when we can look to others.

        Teddy Kennedy’s Oldsmobile Delray was not really the right car for driving Mary Jo off the bridge, way too dowdy for a swingin’ Irishman, and that neutral color was so off-putting…  😉

            Actually, it’s a fascinating bit of historical insight that the fabulously wealthy Ted Kennedy was driving an Oldsmobile. These days a mid-level bureaucrat in DC wouldn’t be caught dead driving a mass-produced American car–it’s all Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, etc. How times have changed.

                Back then Oldsmobiles were known for spectacular comfort and driving pleasure. They were the luxury car for people who didn’t want to be seen as pretentious. Whether the Kennedy clan preferred to be perceived as Everyman or as Royalty, I leave as an exercise for the reader.

        Re the Italian segment, wow-just-wow on the Salvini critic’s self-parodic citations to the Anatomy of Fascism, Israeli historians, etc…  A classic example of pundits referring to past punditry and trying to pass it off as academics, analysis or even expert opinion.
After listening to just the excerpts from that screed, I’m even more motivated to burn down the “liberal democratic world order.”  If that’s the Orwell-tier misnomered hill Yesterday’s Men choose to die on, tomorrow belongs to us.

        The great promise of Europe is that there are a dozen or so unique identities in western Europe alone to present different possibilities in how  the fire is lit. If just one  goes rogue the rest become ripe for it. We see in Poland and Hungary how unnerved our overlords have become over a little disobedience.

        So I hooted at your closing segment last week.Your rant about Assange couldn’t be further from the truth, so much so I had to listen to it twice.He is the press- at the time the Constitution was written most of the “press” was phamphleteers, the idea that the institutionalised clowns who all go to the same schools, have their “Press cards” receive thier drivel in “Press rooms”and attend the “Press Dinners” constitute the founder idea of the press  is a joke.The First Amendment was written specifically to protect the Assanges of the world, those acquiring and publishing the things that the Government thievesand murderous thugs want to keep secret.That is the essence, the only true value of journalism.The real horror here is the degree to which the States bullshit is accepted.
