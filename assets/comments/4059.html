        I like the way you write (aside from improper English Her and her people…) and your psychological insights.

        Shrillary will not be the nominee because the MSM is not going to go to the mat for her. Her negatives keep piling up and ValJ has decided that she is done with her. Shrillary has never been a damsel in distress. She is a conniving, calculating, corrupt viper who believes the Rule of Law is for Other People. She thought the Obama-ites would cover for her. She made the wrong calculation this time.

        The democrats have nothing to worry about.The republicans, as they are wont to do, will implode and nominate a candidate who is either unelectable or, if very electable, will run an incompetent, robotic, unemotional, loser of a campaign.As for Hillary , well, if nominated, the media will unite behind her and out-Pravda, out-Der Sturmer, their propaganda machine to prevent a republican from winning. The media would support Hitler or Stalin or Kim Jong or the Grand Klaxon of the KKK if they ran for president as a democrat opposing a republican. Hell, Abe Lincoln, who was a REPUBLICAN, would today be metaphorically shot dead by the media if he ran for president ( unless he switched parties ).The media will forget all of Hillary’s criminal past and criminal present faster than white on snow – whatever it takes- to prevent the election of a republican president.The democrats understand that half ( or more) of the voters are clueless and if the voters can be reached on an EMOTIONAL LEVEL, they will win.The republicans are simply too STUPID to understand this and they will simply stick to facts, which to most folks, have zero impact ( right now) on their daily lives.The republicans presently control congress, but as usual, the democrats there, and Obama, are setting the agenda. What else  is new??No political party can “bend over” better or faster than the republicans.

        I get the sense that Barry is married to Mike strictly for appearances, and I don’t mean her looks. If Mike is going to look like her mother it’s a hard road ahead, for her at least.

        I think it’s the money that led to her early problems. It appears Bill was not too concerned about making ends meet, probably assuming correctly, that power will lead to a sufficient supply of wealth. I think she was being sincere when she complained about how she felt “broke” when they left DC owing millions to lawyers. Not that any intelligent law firm would dun the Clintons, better to have them owing you than the other way around.And for all his flaws, Bob Dole had a successful career and was respected in the Republican Party. He probably knew in his gut that running in ’96 was a forlorn hope.

            There always has been a grubbiness to HRC. I get the sense Obama has the same problem with his old lady, but he was smart enough to keep the check book away from her. It’s not hard to imagine Michelle stealing the china on the way out.

        The on-going systematic dismantling of the Clinton mystique has the specific objective of clearing the decks for new-old-reliable-insider with a boatload of IOUs from decades of dispensing indulgences, Joe Biden.
Don’t laugh, no one out there has won more elections than good ol’Joe.

            The Lib-Dems are a bit of a black box. The press avoids reporting on the inside baseball stuff with them, at least the important stuff. Seven years in with Obama and most people know little about the man and how things work inside the White House. By this point, we usually have loads of insider tell-all books and long reports in the weeklies. The rumor in DC is someone from Team Obama leaked the e-mail story. If so, it could be just old fashioned spite or maybe it is part of something else.

        I think you largely underestimate Fake Indian’s chances.  She may be dumb as a stump, but that can be taken care of.  After all, they did it for Obama. Only friendly media, and always on teleprompter.

        Hillary Clinton will not be President because her own party hates her.  When the actual head of the party in 2008, Ted Kennedy, endorsed Barack Obama, the Clinton candidacy was over.  She never had a chance.Now the current head of the Democrat Party, Valerie Jarrett, is strategically releasing deleterious information to damage Hillary before she even announces.  Notice where the attacks on Hillary are surfacing:  the main networks, WaPo, the NYT.  The only people covering for her are old Clinton hands like Lanny Davis and James Carville, who have been kept on the Foundation payroll for that purpose.  There have even been a few preemptive strikes on beloved Bill, such as the resurfacing of the Joseph Epstein/pedophile connection.The Obama machine hates Clinton Inc, which is seen as untrustworthy and insufficiently dogmatic.  They don’t want Mrs. Clinton mucking around with the Obama legacy.  They would rather see a centrist Republican win in 2016, someone who can clean up the mess in the Middle East, ram through some form of amnesty, and take the blame for the next inevitable economic meltdown.  Then they can swoop in in 2020 or 2024 with a die hard progressive to instigate the next phase in the construction of the hive.

            She could be president if the GOP can’t run anyone good and stocks and the economy keep improving. If things really go downhill in Obama’s final year, the GOP should have a good shot at winning.
