        There is no more successful carny than Sean Hannity. 29 years (!!!) he’s been running his schtick on Fox News. That’s a man who knows how to stay in good graces with the higher ups. Many others have come and gone in that time, fallen out of favor. Yet he’s still in that same time slot, still saying the same tired old things. Who watches this? What pathetic people they must be! I’ve told this story here once before, I tell it again. On a road trip last year, in my hotel room, I turned on Fox News (something I never do at home), and there was Sean, railing about the double standards of the left. That was the whole theme of the show! It was like nothing had changed since 2004. The very same show he was running back then, still running in 2024. This must work with someone. Clearly with the producers of Fox News and their superiors, but presumably some viewers are into it also, since they are claiming close to 3 million of them. I hope that’s a made up number, because frankly it’s horrifying that so many people would tune in for this.

            I am baffled he still has an audience.  I suppose if the old people who watch fade away to a point where FOX cancels his show Hannity is old enough and has enough money to retire with ease. He sounds like a completely different person than he did when the FOX guests were an endless parade of Neocons.  Just shifts like the wind and acts like he never held the old position.  Checking Hannity’s website it looks like he had Newt Gingrich on recently.  I suppose there is no harm in old Republicans thinking about their glory days, but I don’t see how this can last much longer either.

                Last time I checked, The Simpsons and Family Guy are still creating new seasons. Who watches those shows anymore? I guess FOX is the Eternal Boomer that can’t let go. Except for Tucker Carlson.

                    I don’t watch network TV and had no idea those shows were still on, who could possibly still be watching them?  Network shows have such low ratings now they must use anything they can to fill up the time.

                        Does anyone under 45 watch network TV?  Who will they try to appeal to as the boomers die off?  I will read the back of a cereal box (and I don’t eat cereal) before I will watch tv – which I haven’t done in years.

                            This is something I think about a lot. I have no idea what is on network TV. The only people I know who watch it are baby boomers. I read that the media age of a 60 Minutes viewer is mid-70’s. This is true for sports. The television demo is aging quickly. Young people do not sit and watch content like this.

                                I watched 60 minutes with my father when I was a kid in the ’60s and early ’70s.  It’s not just that my politics have changed – I have no patience with the commercial breaks and the pace of information.  Same reason I mute all YT videos and watch/skim at double speed with closed captions.  Yes, sometimes I miss some details, but in general I process information fairly quickly, and I will pause and open another link to check, compare, and then come back.

Because you hate inter-racial couples. Racist.

                                Whenever I watch sportsball on network TV (sorry!) I am astounded by the shows they are peddling. CBS has been the #1 channel for years because they figured all this out and have been making boomer procedurals and been cleaning up. The latest one is “Watson” which is kind of like a poor man’s House with a black guy.

                                    I’ll plead guilty to watching sportsball too and recently bought an antenna so I can do it without paying for cable.  Morbid curiosity and/or nostalgia has led me to sample some of the over-the-air programming too.Besides the promos for the boomercon shows you mention, what has been a revelation for me is how many of the ads are either for greasy prolefood on the one hand or on the other, things that invite the viewer to imagine a fashion model or nouveau riche lifestyle.  Fancy clothes, cars &amp; jewelry, dining in fine restaurants — and the models in these ads are almost always black.Trips to exotic locations are featured too, and I suppose the audience there could be retirees. (Many of the older people I know here in my suburb of Seattle can’t stop bragging about their latest vacation abroad.)  But the people the ads portray enjoying those trips are often young families.  And blacks again, of course.The message, as it always has been, is spend spend spend, money is no object. Eat, drink, and be merry…

                                    The number one show on CBS and tv is a show called Tracker where a big white guy from fly-over country drives a Chevy HD2500 with a silver camper trailer and finds lost women. So its a white hunk saving women in distress. On the PC side he has an Asian lawyer; a lesbian business manager and two black guys who do amazing tech stuff.CBS used to rule the airwaves based on the Navy Criminal Investigation series created by the guy who created MAGNUM PI and the military show JAG. For fourteen years they also had Tom Selleck (the former MAGNUM star) as the lead actor on Blue Bloods, a show that was intended to celebrate the drop in crime in New York and police in general. So CBS had the most conservative scripted programs and the highest ratings. It is interesting to note that none of the more conservative shows won many or any Emmys

                                The earliest tv I remember watching (other than the Thanksgiving Day parades) was “Car 54 Where Are You?” which ran from ’61-’63. And it was before we moved, so I was 3-4 years old.  The latest I watched was Star Trek re-runs in the ’70s, and then years later my son had me watch Firefly.

                            Linear broadcast television is all but dead now. Cable has at best another five or ten years. I suspect a lot of black money is now propping up broadcast (USAID is not alone in funding these things) but its efficacy is making even that investment dubious.

                            Here are the ratings for this Tuesday night.  The highest rating show with 5.6 million viewers is a propaganda show about the FBI on CBS.  In the 90s, the top rated shows had four times that many viewers.  A show with 5.6 million would have been canceled. The ad revenue can’t justify the cost, even with cable fees.Some of these shows have been on for decades like NCIS and the Law and Order franchise. Fox is running a show I had never heard of before looking this up called “The Cleaning Lady” with an absurd plot that has to be read to be believed.  It averages 1 million viewers according to this and is in its fourth season. I don’t understand how network TV can keep going like this.https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/tuesday-tv-ratings-night-court-fbi-will-trent-alert-wwe-nxt/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cleaning_Lady_(American_TV_series)

The latter have their tentacles in just about every sector of the economy. One reason Putin has earned their eternal enmity for kicking some of their ilk out of Moscow.

                                Is there a workable theory about why crime shows where a real crime is replayed with a white man in the role of the actual black criminal skew so female in terms of audience?
Obviously, my worldview needs some further work, but someone must be looking into this.

                            I wonder if the online Lefties still like to loudly proclaim that they “don’t have a television”. I mean there are probably more people who don’t have a TV now simply because they can’t afford the $200/mo cable fees. I think they killed analog broadcasts so would there even be anything to watch if you had a TV and no cable subscription?
I guess the purple-haired will always find some way to advertise their superiority to the Dirt people. Probably now it’s “I quit Twitter for Bluesky because Elon Musk is a Nazi”.

                                The previous owners of our property left us the flatscreen that they used, and there is still a small satellite dish on the roof – but we have never even turned the thing on to see what kind of reception we’d have.  We watch and discuss what we’re interested in online; no need for tv.  And I’m proud my husband gave up network football cold turkey.

                                Last time I was around some baizuo, that actually came up, that they didn’t watch TV. Which baffled me, because how else did they know and believe all the globohomo talking points they were spewing?

                                    Another thing they like to do is talk about how many books they read. I occasionally look at the post summary emails Quora sends me and whenever I see some shitlib denouncing Trumpler it’s a good bet that there’s something in his bio about being a yuuuge reader of books. It’s a none-too-subtle put down of people on the Right by implying that their views are the product of “ignorance”. It’s all very quaint. Listening to online Lefties is like falling into a time machine and ending up back in the mid 80’s at a “no-nukes” rally where everyone is hating on Reagan and wearing t-shirts supporting the Sandinistas.Here in the Portland area lots of these people like to set up “tiny libraries” in their yards to make sure everyone knows they worship bundles of dead tree pulp. It’s hard to decide which would be a better way to troll these people, putting a copy of Mein Kampf in there, or a copy of the Communist Manifesto – maybe both along with some gay porn.

            Agree on Hannity.  We watch Jesse Watters because he is funny and takes joy in mocking the Left.  But he leads into Hannity, and we can’t change the channel fast enough.  He always starts with “breaking news”, but then just gives a 20 minute monologue on the the same stories you have heard about all day.

            Simple….he’s what you call a “team player”  He gets his talking points and the topic for the day and then he does the bit.  Frankly, I think he is an unwatchable mess, but he’s a good boy and does what he is told and so he gets paid and keeps the gig.But why?  He already has a bunch of FU money.  He’s a top Fox News host and a syndicated talk radio guy. He’s probably worth 10s of millions.  Like a true carny, he loves the spotlight, but he’s an old dog that cannot learn any new tricks.  He is incapable of the moves Tucker made.

            Shamelessness is the hallmark of a successful carney along with an ability to adjust accordingly. In addition to mouthing his Golden Oldies nonstop, Hannity on rare occasion can do a 180 and it is not noticed. Know who else is excellent at that? Trump, and that’s not a slam. I caught Hannity’s radio broadcast a while back and he was railing on Zelensky. The last account I had of him was an interview with Sean Penn before the latter decided to go to the Ukraine as a mercenary.The official Left is not alone in its Always at War with Oceania shtick.

            A discerning eye and a small bit of musical literacy can help a person differentiate between the manufactured acts who were handpicked for stardom and the ones who made it on real ability, sometimes in spite of suppression by the industry. Somebody mentioned Van Morrison the other day. Makes for a good contrast with Young.

                    I have repeatedly invoked the same credit to Van. He and Eric Clapton were vocal about the outrageous events. He, Van, is still being sued by the Northern Irish head of health (whatever the title is). I love Van. No joke – one of my daughter’s first complex words was “Van Morrison.”Though he hasn’t put out a good album for about 10 years, his most recent single, “Down to Joy,” is actually a pretty good track. You should check it out, if a fan.

When the Scamdemic pressure arrived, Van showed that he lives what he writes.

            I don’t have the most discerning tastes, but I still like Neil Young’s music from about 5 decades ago.  He may not have aged well, but I think his recorded music has.again, that is my taste.   Don’t care for his politics or religious views, but that is of no import.

                It’s not that Young has no ability at all. He’s not the Spice Girls. Although I can’t stand his singing voice (personal taste), he has written some half decent songs at some points in his career, as you note. But even with that being true, he is in the good graces and has been promoted above and beyond his ability, for a very long time. In no small part because he expresses all the right baizuo politics.

                    Stills carried that band. Great musician. Rest of them were lucky to be there. Especially Crosby. Lot of popular musical acts like that, where one or two members carried it and the others were lucky to have the job. Not that they had no musical ability whatsoever, but they lacked the chops to be successful if they hadn’t latched onto the right people.

            Frankie Valli is another example, though he was a great singer at one time.  But some time in the 80s, Frankie lost his ability to sing his own songs.  He just couldn’t hit those highs anymore.  But he never stopped performing.  It’s such a sad sight to see him in 2025 trying to perform.

                                Some of it was pretty good.  I’m not big on the typical 60s stuff though.  Dion was pretty good.  Dusty Springfield is another one. Frankie Valli is another.   A lot of stuff I like is from the early 60s, not the late 60s.

While I was in the shower, WABC was playing Bobby Vinton and the Chiffons. When classes were dismissed early, and I got on the bus to go home, the 60s had begun.

                            Problem was, the music was the vehicle for the politics.
The worst mistake of my generation was taking musicians as what would nowadays be called our thought leaders.
That started, however, not with Boomers but with the Silent Generation and folk music.  Think commie Pete Seegar, and Woody Guthrie with his guitar labeled “This machine kills fascists”.  But even folkies with more widespread popular appeal like Burl Ives were far left.

That’s because the Left has always been about power, and the Amiable Dunce and his libertarian clown car had a vision of government leaving everybody alone, instead of crushing the Left, pulverizing their dreams, and scattering the detritus to the four winds.
Reaganism wasn’t going to kick anyone anywhere.

            Anybody seen Todd Rundgren since the millennium? He refuses to play any song that he’d known for, scoffs at the very notion from the stage, plays a bunch of dreck that amuses him (and he always had an eclectic style). My wife and I were practically groupies for him in the seventies but we got up and walked out early on from a show in Monterey when he announced that there was no point calling out song titles.

        Disagree to an extent. Lindsey and Peterson aren’t freelance carnies. They’re gatekeepers whose real audience is the usual suspects who promote their acts behind the scenes.Lindsey will be propped up for the same reason that the Daily Wire and Babylon Bee – and even Peterson – are propped up. He’s a gatekeeper, and the usual suspects need gatekeepers.All of them have one thing in common: They push individualism for whites and condemn whites even thinking of joining the identity politics games. Sure, they claim that they’re against identity politics for all groups and, heck, maybe some of them even believe that. But they only apply it to whites.Peterson, Lindsey, Dillion and, of course, Shapiro never chastise Jews for having endless groups to protect and promote the Jewish people nor that Jews view themselves as a distinct people worthy of preserving. But they fight tooth and nail to stop whites from even thinking of themselves as a people.Sure, they have a carney act and have to draw a larger audience, but like record companies paying off DJs to play certain songs, their acts are promoted far harder than a typical carny.

            People this psychologically disorganized have to be propped up because they can’t keep it in the road very long. What astonishes me is that these particular assets are seen to have enough value to prop up. Maybe they are worth it for now, but there is no way Peterson doesn’t end up either in an institution or OD’ing, and Lindsay simply becoming too deranged for even the rubes not to notice.

            The one realization that I wish normie conservatives could have is that how much harder Peterson, Shapiro, and Lindsey denounce white identity over the identity politics of all other races. All their energy goes to suppressing white identity.
Why? The justification for focusing on white identity always goes back to the claim that whites are uniquely evil, as demonstrated by the holocaust and slavery.
It may be that a majority of whites have been convinced by the media that their ancestors were uniquely evil.

                Exactly. They claim to oppose identity politics on the whole but spend all of their time focusing on whites. Oh, and they never – never – chastise Jews for playing the identity politics game (by far) the hardest and most successfully.
They’re quite simply liars.

        Peterson’s appeal always struck me as depressing because he was so clearly a case of controlled opposition with a few good bits for legitimacy. Clean your room and I won’t use your pronouns. Neither of which were threats to the powers that be.What I found most  depressing was how young and early middle aged men I met got so much of of his act. I could only see that as a sign of how rudderless young men are in today’s culture and how much men in their family have failed them. Well maybe that is too harsh because the culture is so anti masculinity that fathers can’t relate to it and don’t know how to guide their kids.Even worse was a carny named, if I remember right, Jack Donovan who coached men on masculinity only to turn out that he was a former gay porn actor.

            Peterson, Lindsey, the Babylon Bee guys, they’re all just another version of the Daily Wire, where, naturally, Peterson now works. Their job is to stop whites from thinking of themselves as a distinct people worth of preserving. They preach individuals and chastise identity politics – but for whites only.
Sure, they claim that they’re against identity politics for all races, but their audience is whites – and they know it. They also never attack the most successful identity group of all. Gatekeepers through and through.

                        If he’s authentically a serious Catholic and comes to understand some key pieces of information, he won’t be able to stay at the Daily Wire. It will be Candace Owens all over again. The Daily Wire is a place for CINOs only. I believe (but don’t quote me) the other Catholic is a Jew by birth and raised that way. We love those converts, but I find most of them with a speaking platform struggle with their faith, either on the JQ or in really accepting most of what it’s teaching.

                            If I still held all the positions now that I held when I was a couple years younger than Matt Walsh, I’d be seriously embarrassed. People do make the journey rightward.

                                It is possible, sure, but if it happened that came about almost overnight, so count me as dubious. It is more likely if this is sincere that he held the beliefs all along and realized it was safe now to voice them. Regardless, Walsh is saying the right things and has a large audience, so it is a good development whatever the motive.

                I assume that Matt Walsh is done at the Daily Wire when his current contract ends. He can do what Tucker is doing and doesn’t need them anymore, they clearly aren’t willing to cross him after how many other hosts they have run off. His arc has been impressive, he went from ignorantly defending Ahmed Arbery to making videos this week about why are there Somalis in Minnesota that would have worked as an AmRen speech.

            The Petersen who wrote his first book,Maps of Meaning, was an interesting guy, on track to become the lesser current_year version of a great philosophy/psychology teacher-summarizer like Strauss or Walter Kaufmann. The tedious internet dad he became when he “took the ticket” is something else—and now he’s something else again, reassigned, theHammer of Antisemites.All these “gatekeeper” characters have offputting voices, or some other strikingly repulsive physical quality, a first-impression dealbreaker thatshouldput you off. Walsh’s horror-prop beard comes to mind. Serious scams begin with a test—a typo-ridden Nigerian email, an Indian voice—to check if you’re a mark, ifyou’ll dance to anything.Ugly is wrong. Your whole body knows.

                It’s been funny to see it pop up in the wild, to the total bafflement of audiences.Monthsnow of failed attempts to force “woke right” into “the discourse” (you know they say “the discourse”). Anywhere that’s not fully controlled, where there are real people encountering the phrase, only those of us who knowexactlywhat the scam is are getting what it’s supposed to signify.“What, you mean Jews?”Whoever came up with it and keeps insisting on it is incredibly stupid. And of course anyone who pushes it is fake and something worse than gay.Some disappointments among our guys, too, the ones who see it as a chance to lord it over their audience, because normal people are baffled by this “woke right” crap and they’re not.It’s quite nuanced and tricky, you see.Sargon and Auron come to mind.

                            Bloody idiots. That’s the very opposite of “woke.” The very essence of “wokeness” is anti-whiteness. White identitarianism, therefore, is its opposite.

        Peterson and Lindsay are rear guard actions of the fading age where the right was completely destroyed but leftists to the bone came in and told everyone they were right wing. That bit between those two mentality ill half wits was them complaining that not only has the ground shifted from beneath them, but that they are the subject of ridicule. Young white men are besieged and watching aliens walk away with their inheritance, with the assistance of Peterson and his ilk.Peterson, whether he knows it or not, is there to buy the hyper-looters more time to do a bit more looting. Young men know this. So, he is left exposed. He is a thoroughly establishment figure who is in a panic because not only does he not have an audience, the men who’ve left his reservation hate him with good reason because they understand his role is to aid in their destruction. Make your bed little boy. He would be wise to accept his fate and not inflame the coming Age of The Vengeful Son.We should take heart that like the establishment Peterson, Murray, Lindsay … are rolled out to protect, their carnival barker’s situation is a premonition of theirs.Speaking of carny reservation managers, I got an ad for a Dave Rubin video the other day. Rubin and some Chinese interloper Lindsey Li, yesterday a Democrat today a right winger type, is giving the inside goods on who was really running the Biden administration. It was a bunch of no-names we’ve never heard of – all non-tribesmen. Li and Rubin were smirking the entire time.There was no secret cabal. Mayorkas ran the invasion and settler colonization project full force with his NGO network. Garfinkle ran the secret police. Blinken ran the state department and played in Ukrainian garage bands while checking in for Fink on the Ukrainian colony project gone awry. Yellen ran treasury. Goldfein ran the military pogrom with Austin and Brown as frontmen. Klein and Heitz managed the vast network of deputies and cabinet assistants who put their picture up on Twitter bragging about how many of them were in the administration making it so diverse.Not a single mention of a single one of them nor of a list of the donors. Someone once said they were going to manage the ethnic dissolution of America by forming an alliance with Asians in order to divide and conquer. Ol’ Carny Dave will never mention that, but he will, via his Asian proxy, find some obscure White goofs to blame. The people who buy that stuff are people who don’t matter. I think that is the thing about these Carnies. Those with agency and energy just aren’t buying that garbage anymore. People who want answers are people who want to matter and they can seek them out and get them. Covering it up is only going to piss them off.It’s okay. The thing is built on quicksand and there are so many holes in so many dykes and Our people have been pushed too far. We Ride The Tiger. Keep yourself and your loved ones safe everyone. That is all we can do, but that is everything. Our families and our friends and our emerging bonds as a people are everything.

                Then there is this dullard in Con Inc:https://www.theamericanconservative.com/is-woke-right-a-useful-term/Either he is dull or just a much more clever and arrogant smarm-master than Peterson and the IDW Carnies.Assuming he is dull, then he doesn’t understand that colorblind civic nationalism has failed. White people are no longer going to show up to an alley fight blindfolded and singing kumbaya. The excesses of the Woke left are not excesses. The senseless murders of our people day after day after day are not senseless excesses. Nor are they an organized political movement. They are the consequence of forced integration and emergent savage criminality. They are as much the willful ignorance of Con Inc. trying to stay, “in the center.” Here is the thing about the, “Woke Right.”It doesn’t exist. What does exist, that is very clear, is that there is a monolithic left and they are all, “anti-racists.”If there is justice in this world, Ante III and Peterson or one of these guys will get savaged instead of another 23 year old girl visiting friends on a small town campus, or another set of parents summarily executed for no reason or another promising young man stabbed in his heart claiming his track tent from a savage squatter.I hate to wish ill on people. But, it is this snooty willful ignorance and desire to stay above the fray and be, “anti-racist”, that has destroyed this country. We have to push these callous cowards out of the way.

        The thing that makes carnies is the complete lack of self respect. Who else would make a fool of themselves on a stage for the amusement of their fellow citizens?Jordan Peterson is a classic example of these carnies. His whole depraved life has been played out in front of the camera, with even his drug addiction on display for all to see. He’s a very ill man, yet these “conservatives” worship him because he made a few rightish statements?Reminds me of that quote from Star Wars:“Who’s the more foolish?

        We live in an era of information overload in which our brains are unable to process and utilize the fire hose of data flying at us incessantly. Too much media from too many devices and platforms. As such, there is no time to reflect, digest, and incorporate useful knowledge for real world application. The result is miasma fatigue. Better is to limit inputs to a few trusted sources taken in small doses. Then independently connect dots and formulate paths of use. No one should speak publicly without a defined purpose and useful benefit.

        I never understood the appeal of this Peterson fellow. The “mock profundity” with which he delivers stale cliches must have been part of the draw. His target audience is presumably the middle-brow aspiring to “the upper middle-brow” level. An original thinker is never going to have the appeal of a carny.

            Booshie people often mistake gibberish for profundity. I think it was Foucault who said that much of his writing was deliberately unintelligible, as that is what modern intellectuals expected. Peterson also flattered an underserved audience by being an “intellectual” that supposedly too Scripture seriously. His success, I think, is in that he borrowed from a few successful internet styles and rolled them into the Jordan Peterson act.I am not sure it is a front brain thing with carnies. My sense is the top carnies are driven to get an audience and they are highly tuned to sense the mood of an audience. I would bet early on on his YouTube career that he read every comment in the same way comics read the room after every joke.

                The problem for Peterson is that he came on at a time when normies were desperate for any public figure in the media who didn’t condemn them. Peterson pushing back against the pronoun nonsense made him a hero to normies.The same is true for the Daily Wire and the Babylon Bee. They attacked the Left, including the pushing back against DEI and systemic racism. Normie whites were overjoyed that someone – anyone – wasn’t attacking them.The problem is that Peterson, Lindsey, Shapiro, Dillion, etc., is that normies have more choices now and have started to move toward our side of the great divide while these guys have stayed in the “identity politics is bad” and whites should never view themselves as a people camp.Their logical contradictions – whites should be individuals but Jews can team up all they want – now get hammered hundreds of times a day and they have no response. Their fanatical love of Israel doesn’t help them either.Normies (their audience) are moving, but they can’t.

                “Peterson also flattered an underserved audience by being an “intellectual” that supposedly too Scripture seriously.”If there was one thing that Jordan did not take seriously, it was/is Scripture. I’ll grant an initial personal handicap on the topic by being raised Catholic. However, at this point in my life I’ve read Scripture enough to know that Jordan was just full of boring modern secular deconstructive analysis on the topic. It drove me crazy to have Christians trot out his OT analysis like what an open theist/agnostic would have anything valuable to say to a believer. At least a Protestant pastor is serious on the topic.Apparently his wife is now Catholic after a brush with cancer.

                Its funny how writing incomprehensibly and confusing the audience goes from an error caused by lack of experience, to a difficult skill that takes a lot of skill and forethought.

                Foucault did almost say that. He was annoyed that his early work sold far better than he thought it should. He started out writing for an audience he estimated at 300 people, specialists of an extremely insular language. No one else could possibly understand what he was getting at. The book translated asThe Order of Thingsis so obscure and reliant on prior reading, to a normal person there are effectively no statements in it. It was a bestseller. About 300 people have read it.He gradually lowered his rhetoric to the level of a really smart normal guy (and became a libertarian, and may have pioneered the “libertarian to alt right pipeline” had he lived). Still rarely understood—not least because he was a traditionalist, a continuer of the West’s textual work, which already by then was becoming a lost/foreign tradition.I’ve said a dozen times, because normal righties don’t know this, that by the time I became an Ivy League student circa 1990, Foucault had already been thrown on the Dead White Male discard pile. We were assigned one book of his anddidn’t read it. The lesson was the professor apologizing to the class that the book had the word “genius” on the back of it.Foucault was the last great philosopher—and “postmodernism” the Last Stand of Whiteness. (He wasn’t a postmodernist.)

                    I’m sorry, but that’s rank hogwash. Foucault was the Left’s high priest of deviance and perversion, the New Left’s intellectual lodestar after falling out with the critical theorists (chiefly Adorno and Horkheimer) circa 1965, and possibly the greatest enemy of Western civilization since Rousseau. And when I began graduate school in 1996, he was very much considered a hero by the faculty. But I suspected this would be the case even before I entered grad school and accordingly read The Order of Things. I figured it would be a good idea to steal a march.(Foucault was definitely a postmodernist. Along with Derrida, one of its “patriarchs.” Oh, the irony.)

                Philosophers, particularly those of the 20th and 21st centuries, and even more particularly, the postmodernists and existentialists, have a profound horror of being understood. For them, intelligibility equals stupidity and coherence equates to superficiality. More uncharitably, and possibly even more accurately, their obscurity occludes the fact that they really have very little to say. To my way of thinking, if you have something you think is important to say, you will be at great pains of making sure everybody understands just what it is you’re trying to say. Only through understanding will readers appreciate the value of your ideas. Conversely, if your ideas are threadbare and nugatory, you’ll hide them behind a welter of gibberish.

            I remember Z once said about Barack Obama that you listened to his speech and felt something, then read it on the page and it was total nonsense. I think the same thing is true of Peterson. When he was just getting famous I didn’t watch a lot of his stuff and read it and it seemed like gibberish. Then once he said he drank a glass of cider and couldn’t sleep for a month, I was out.Say what you will about him, Vox Day figured JP out before most people, and he did it by… reading his book. The first one. The weird one. Most people just sort of pretended it didn’t exist and just focused on his TV interviews and self-help book.

                                Teddy Spaghetti is an extreme narcissist, so much so that I would not be surprised if the bunny girl was fake. He has said a few things that lightly suggested he has a demonic accomplice, and done one thing that moderately suggested it. While his narcissism is largely organic, the demonic accomplice would help explain why it goes to 11.No, the man is fundamentally not a Christian. The odd moment people remember him has me wish I had something more concrete to say here.But as Marko said, Teddy calling out JP was a standard bad-faith, self promotion stunt. He was trying to peel off a few disaffected lads to join his personality cult. Calling JP something like the anti-Christ was more projection than insight.

            I am not JP’s biographer, so this is a “more or less” summary.JP’s academic work in evolutionary psychology via reading scientific explorations of the brain by biology researchers, on one side, and the best of modern psychology to include Jung, on the other, culminated in him stumbling into the symbolic language embedded in stories and then connecting that symbolic language to human biology and psychological development. Just as active logic cannot escape identity, the human mind cannot escape the human body, so the internal logic of stories backtracks through psychology into biology. The Hero’s Journey is, among other things, a genetic activation process. This idea should be an expected outcome, and JP was the one to put serious work into why it is true at a physiological level. His surprisingly broad range of life experience, combined with an ability to connect story to biology in academic lectures, combined with his personality profiling work with the “Big 5” sowed the initial seeds of his popularity.Two things took him to the next level. He took his experience in connecting story to biology through the symbolic language of story and applied it to Genesis in a lecture series posted on youtube, where his normal academic lectures already had a small following. This is what people mean when they say JP took the Bible “seriously”. There is a significant sense where Roman Catholicism and Protestantism had relegated the Bible to religious dogma, which is another discussion, and that relegation disconnected the Bible from experienced reality. JP reconnected the Bible to experienced reality and demonstrated a new approach to exploring the Biblical narrative. Except it was not an entirely new approach. The Eastern Orthodox tradition had maintained the symbolic language of the Bible and story largely via their iconography and various mystics. JP’s unique contribution was to connect the symbolism to evolutionary psychology and the underpinning biology. Jonathan Pageau is a good resource for the Christian symbolic tradition. If his videos can be slow and sometimes meandering, they are oftentopical.Second, one of JP’s deepest motivations is fear, which is why his voice sounds the way it does. His fear of Canadian Bill C-16 compelled him to take a stand and join the culture war on the “conservative” side, which meant that cultural conservatives suddenly had a voice for their cause who was not a shallow, vain and entirely feckless poser, or controlled opposition, or gatekeeper as you prefer. Fame and fortune followed, which allowed a third dynamic to cement him into the public conscious.People enjoy deriding JP’s life advice as overly basic, but basic is universal, and basic is what people need when they were given nothing by their parents and their culture. “Clean your room” only works when you have no life direction and no sense of personal development, not even the basic behaviors associated with those things, and that advice worked. For far, far too many. JP remains humbled and saddened by how many people come up to him and tell him that his overly basic life advice worked. “People don’t need much, and it’s amazing to see what they can do with a little positive nudge.” In a culture that is trying to kill you, any source of direction and encouragement is experienced as a heroic godsend. Particularly if their parents have to fall back to “food, clothing, shelter and basic American education” for reasons why said parents are not complete failures. It is more common than you think.The problem is that JP is a fearful Classical Liberal, and not a Christian. His “We who wrestle with God” circus is based on a very stupid and very incorrect interpretation of Numbers 20:10-12, where JP claims that using force to take the promised land is always wrong. That is a fundamental liberal belief but not a Christian one. “The Book of Joshua exists” is your short and concise argument against JP’s position. The man is not a Biblical scholar, the internal logic of his core beliefs are incompatible with the Kingdom of God, and I suspect the IDW midgets alongside AI summaries of the Bible provide JP some mix of lies and misleading statements.Besides signing a deal with the devil, JP’s current behavior was best summarized byChristian Heiens– “I’m a Liberal who realizes the Left has now gone beyond Liberalism and I’m here to tell the Right about how they need to become more Liberal so as to keep my ideology alive.” The inherent gatekeeping nature of it is useful to the powers that be, yes, but it is also an organic and good faith expression of who JP unfortunately is.

        “Soon, people get bored of the “woke right’ nonsense.”I don’t remember anyone ever taking it seriously. In any case, JP is in trouble. He might be a fading star, but he brought it on himself. He backed thewrong horse. He took Ben Shapiro’s money when Daily Wire was peaking, but it’s a joke now. Everyone sees it for the blatant hasbara operation it is. And part of being that operation means he has to bring on gatekeeping losers like James Lindsay, instead of someone who people actually want to hear (all of whom are making fun of James Lindsay).

                Richard Fernandez, the only Filipino Tondo gangster who went to Harvard, was my daily read before the Zman. Wretchard’s audience at the Belmont Club were spouting the exact same Cold War mummy canards years later when I checked back.
The same is true of my mentor, a Vietnam war vet and early Boomer, as well as my older brother, also a Nam vet. They seem stuck in amber, unable or uninterested in anything new.
Calcified pineal glands from the fluoride, maybe? One thing I ruefully realized just this week: you really can’t teach some old dogs new tricks.

                    Fernandez used to be good, but somewhere around covid I couldn’t read his stuff anymore. He started parroting the party line during the vid and continued with the Kraine thing and is basically unreadable now. Like Steve Sailer, he might have been decent at one point but I assume the vid broke his mind.

        Lindsay is clearly a smart guy who has gone nuts. I said so to Charles Haywood in an X exchange we had. Haywood said that Lindsay had to be crushed mercilessly, crazy or not. Maybe I’m too soft and Haywood is right. Peterson has huge personal issues and cannot be taken seriously. Both give off the Amy Winehouse/Scott Weiland tragic vibes of fame seekers who cannot handle it and are going down. TomA (frequent commenter) is probably right that the DR will succeed through silent, deadly types who will sneak up on the system. The fame seekers are usually nuts, grifters or controlled opposition.

            I take credit for being the first to point out that Lindsay was having some sort of breakdown. At the time, I said it was from too much exposure to leftist phenomenology. Now I think he is just a sad sack desperate for acceptance. That makes him easily exploited.

                I am soft-hearted.   I hope that enough factory jobs come back to America so the excess internet entrepreneurs, political grifters, excess university staff and government employees can find useful, dignified roles at living wages.   A dosage of actual work and dealing with reality on average or lower wages –with no external markers showing one’s education or high status– does wonders for clearing one’s thoughts.

                He was associated with a horrific sex trafficking cult and as a result sees a group of two or more people as “collectivism” because of that experience. He was also a member of the cringe “New Atheist” movement, which makes his criticism of Communism rather amusing, listening to a materialist talk about “equality” and other such non-material concepts.

                I wish people could be poisoned by books, but I’ve never seen an example of it (except schizophrenics getting “messages” from them).
The lesson of people like Lindsay is simple and terrible: There are no converts. We are who we are—as of a certain past date. “Of course I was a liberal in college.”“Like many of us, I came up through movement conservatism.”“I was a teenage libertarian.” You still are, and you cannot change or be changed—not truly, not in your allegiance, not in yoursoul. It’s a ghost. Past.

        It struck me at lunch as I pondered this post today. The carnival is, ironically, trying to hold center stage. That is to say, the system has been trying to maintain an illusion that it is holding a center and is value neutral for 80+ years.The Carnies are the last of the clowns in the fading spotlight at the center ring. Instead of funny giggles, as the audience boos and with no clue of what to do, the clowns denounce the audience revealing their preference for the ringmasters and revealing how at odds the ringmasters are with those who know there is no center ring.Karmelo Anthony and his cold blooded murder and the, not just remorseless, but open celebration and support of his murder and the naked revelation that they want us dead has shattered it.The system feigned neutrality in order to make significant gains. Those trying to hold the center in earnest are fools. Those who aren’t are revealed as frauds. Jordan Peterson earnestly believes his life must be about preventing the rise of Nazis. I think he is dull enough to believe it. He is a two bit therapist elevated way above his station in the decaying ages of the Ragnarok of the mass man. The tension rips him apart as he breaks down in hysteric crying spells and lashes out in scorn as he accuses the Nazis he sees hiding under the rocks of lashing out in scorn.They aren’t Nazis. They are a people who have been denied peoplehood – who are stateless and under seige. It is a strange circus. The kind like Siegfried and Roy ran where maybe someday the tiger just decided, that with no voice and smelling weakness it has had enough.

        The Babylon Bee mocked the Peterson act awhile back, with “Jordan Peterson Explains The Deep Meaning Behind 9 Famous Song Lyrics.”  You can hear his inflection as you read them, i.e.  “Who Let the Dogs Out” by Baha Men: “‘Who let the dogs out?’ Well, that’s the real question, isn’t it? There’s a sense in which we’ve all let the dogs out…”

        Ah yes, Jordan Peterson. I remember my first exposure to him was when a normie conservative type friend recommended his book. I hadn’t seen any of his videos but was aware of this latest “it” conservative rising star, but didn’t have any preconceived notions other than natural suspicion of main stream conservatives.Once I read the book I was shocked. Shocked that it was so incoherent and the understandable parts not even insightful. It was utter dreck. I knew then what this guy was, a huge phony masquerading as an intellectual. Like that Neil de Grass Tyson or whatever his name is, just a fake smart guy. I also realized why these types have such a huge audience- they flatter their fans by thinking they too are super smart to even understand their brilliance when in actuality they’re saying a bunch of BS five dollars words to make themselves sound smarter than they are.I always found it funny that Americans automatically think one sounds smart if they have a British accent. A bloke could be reading a cooking book in some high sounding English and Americans just assume he’s a genius. What I cannot even fathom is how anyone thought Jordan Peterson’s stupid nasally Canadian accent made him sound remotely smart at all.

            Hehe I thought that too about Canadian accents, they are so goofy. I don’t think it’s that Peterson is not smart it’s just that he is perhaps defending the indefensible. An atheistic state managing individuals with nothing in common is against nature. It’s impossible to defend it

        hoisted from Zerohedge@Raywas this you 😉  A lot of truth to this comment“The problem is human nature.The United States government is the biggest business in the world.It runs on other peoples and borrowed money and doesn’t give a **** about any of its customers.The government gives IOU’s to the Federal Reserve which is a private corporation and not subject to being audited or disclosing anything.They mostly just punch numbers into a screen that credits .gov with money and they also print a nominal amount.All of this money is literally created out of nothing and then they get to charge interest on it.Everyone in power and employed by this corrupt .gov business benefits from an ever expanding amount of IOU’s given to the Federal Reserve.Some of the sheeple benefit if they’re NOT net contributors into the system through taxes..gov has also managed to convince some citizens that they’re the only thing that stands between them and numerous impending dooms so they FEEL they benefit from the system.. gov doesn’t really care if you’re a Republican or a Democrat, a liberal or a conservative, they just want you pretty evenly divided against each other so the grift goes on.The vast majority of people in the higher and highest positions of power in .gov and it’s assorted bureaucracies, lust endlessly for money, power, and status, which is human nature.They use all the money they get from the IOU’s to enrich themselves, family, friends, and associates through every manner of back door deals, fraud, and grift.The interest of all of these people from the Federal Reserve and from the highest to the least government worker, along with the non-contributors and the fearful sheeple are completely aligned.. gov is a debatable necessary evil that must always be kept as small as possible and then cut in half from there because of the inherent flaws of the system and human nature.When .gov becomes a 35% parasite of your GDP you’re approaching a point of no return.Masculine, moral, powerful, strong, armed men are the natural enemy of evil.Women will always choose security over freedom, because of their nature, which has adapted over millennia, they primarily make decisions based on visceral feelings and emotions.You can correlate the decline and the massive ramp in debt directly to women being more empowered.They are adept, in the micro, at control through manipulation and coercion but are more easily managed in the macro because of feelings and fear.They love spending money, particularly borrowed and other people’s, which make them perfect politicians.The majority of men have weak sexual impulse control and will sacrifice their morals, standards, ethics, and self-respect in an effort to satiate these desires by obtaining money, power, and status granting them approval from and access to one woman or many.These are the mechanisms and realities used to destroy and control the family, men, women, children, society, etc. all the while virtue signaling and promoting some impossible utopian future where everyone has everything, while doing nothing, and somehow being completely equal.It’s complex but it’s not complicated.The only hope is for the return of masculine, moral, powerful, strong, armed men taking positions of leadership and making sacrifices for the greater good…so, not much hope left.”

        Peterson is an academic who entered through the manosphere, singing a watered-down version of that song but failing to credit the writers.
He is harmless enough that the PTB tolerate him as a (gatekeeping) foil to their longstanding tool, feminism.  Thesis, antithesis, synthesis.
Despite weaksaucing the real deal, Peterson helps broaden the audience for my own advocacies and so likewise I tolerate him. He somewhat reduces the tendency of the gyno-government to scapegoat ‘incels’.

        A blatantly mentally ill clinical psychologist appearing in public to unironically interview an obviously mentally ill crank and grifter is Peak Carney. While his act garners immensely more coin tossed in the hat, Peterson is little more than the schizophrenic street musician strumming tunes on the sidewalk. Lindsay is satisfied with just a bigger and fuller hat. It is astonishing to think circus freak shows were considered somehow more vulgar. They were high culture by comparison, and cable gabfests are the Royal Shakespeare Theatre compared to internet influencers, who make OnlyFans cam whores blush.I don’t know where along the timeline Peterson’s OD is, but it has to be near the endpoint.

        Peterson gives utterly trivial bits of advice about living a “meaningful life” and they’re regarded as pearls of wisdom. His book, 12 Rules for Life, is the case in point.
Stand up straight with your shoulders back.Tell the truth – or at least don’t lie.Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.
Yes, I know a “philosophical” spin is furnished for each rule – otherwise the whole thing might be smothered with ridicule.

            Never pet a cat you don’t know personally. That’s funny petting a stray cat. Cats are sneaky critters. I remember going into someone’s house and they told me not to pet their cat that came up rubbing all over my legs. Apparently their cat used that ruse to lure the sucker into petting (her)? and then pounced. Ferrets are worse however.

                        In the 80s, the WSJ noted a peculiar fad of the British upper class:“ferret legging”.
The tony toffs of Fleet Street would tie off the bottom cuffs of their pants and then slip a ferret into their trousers.
Seeing as how the ferret is carnivorous, this posed an element of especial danger to the lads…it quite makes one shrivel up a bit, dinnit?

        I see what the Z man is getting at here. Not quite clear on why his targets are Jordan Peterson and James Lindsay, when more widely-known and deserving targets (restricting ourselves to the “right”) include the likes of Victor Davis Hansen, Sean Hannity, those guys who replaced Rush Limbaugh…
And speaking of Rush, yeah, he never really “evolved” from his Reagan worship. But, unlike the “carneys” he never stopped being the kid from rural Missouri. He never went carney.

        Lindsey’s term “woke right” is a surface level analysis, and is a total fail when you get past the surface level. The SJW left collectivizes groups into a Marx derived oppressor/oppressed status, and use racial groups within that framework. Lindsey claims the “woke right” does the same thing, using racial groups to classify people, butcompletelymisseswhythe “woke right” does that.We use racial groups to classify and predictbehavior,notwhere they stand in the oppression stack.This is a fundamental error on the part of Lindsey, and is almost certainly intentional.As for JPB, say what you will about Vox, but he had JBP pegged instantly, and even coined the perfect term for the way JBP talks: bafflegarble. As several have noted here, listening closely to what JBP says is exactly that, an exercise in deciphering patent bullshit dressed up in midwit jargon.

        AUGUSTINE: Scripture says, “The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God’.” Suppose one of those fools were to say that to you.Suppose he did not want to believe what you believe, but to know whether what you believe is true. Would you just give up, or would you think that he could somehow be persuaded of what you firmly believe especially if he was not merely being contentious, but sincerely wanted to know?EVODIUS: This last proviso of yours suggests a response. However absurd he might be, he would surely concede that one should not discuss anything, and especially not such an important matter, with a deceitful and obstinate person. Then he would have to get  me to believe that he had the proper attitude and was not concealing any deceitfulness or obstinacy regarding this issue. Then I would point out to him that he expects other people to believe things about his own state of mind, things that he knows but other people do not. And I would try to get him to see (as I think anyone easily can) how much more reasonable it is for him to believe that God exists on the authority of the writings of such great men, who left written testimony that they lived with the Son of God, and wrote that they saw things that could not have happened if God did not exist. He would be completely foolish to reproach me for believing them, when he expects me to believe him. And since he could not rightly reproach me, he would have no reason not to join me.,

        Fame is fleeting. A good example of this is Elvis. In his time, he was gigantic, but his tunes no longer get airplay on the radio and his recorded voice has not aged well compared to, say, the Beatles. And yet Elvis the personality is remembered. His smile, his swiveling hips, his soft Southern accent. He and Marilyn Monroe have come to define the whole postwar era up until 1970. In the movieBlade Runner 2049there is even a holographic Elvis. Presidents come and go — Lyndon Johnson is forgotten — but Elvis the personality is forever.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            I’m not so sure Elvis is forever. The Beatles have endless pop culture references too. He might outlast Presidents, but it’s distinctly possible in 100 years, the question will be “Elvis who?”

                I see your point, but the 1950s and 1960s were a watershed in Western history. Every defining event needs a face to memorialize it. The Civil War has Lincoln’s hat and face while his opponent David is utterly forgotten. Sometimes you can transcend Fame and be remembered, a neat trick if you can pull it off.
