        Those of us dealing with the bureaucratic thugs on the Left Coast would tell you it’s already here.I think, unfortunately, that we will see blood shed over this in the near future. The government agencies are arming up for it.

        I doubt the ruling class will recoil at the madness. They have much to fear from the Clinton Mafia. If Roberts and Comey can be threatened into submission, then anybody can. I fear for Donald Trump’s life.

        From this side of the great puddle, I would have thought that such a brazen act to not formally charge Madame Clinton would if anything propel those who are undecided about which way to vote in November to definitely NOT vote for the escapee. Maybe most people have made up their minds, but although outrageous is a much-overused word these days, this craven decision is exactly that. I am, as we say over here, gobsmacked.But perhaps I shouldn’t be given the nature of politics. Our fears in the UK is that the government here has a clear direction from the people over the EU, yet maybe somehow they will find ways to fudge it and dodge it. Meanwhile, if we needed any further proof that despite all the lofty words some people are simply above the law, this failure to ensure justice stands emblazoned across the skies of the United States.So close to Independence day too. Maybe the message is you are a lot more dependent on the cloud people than you thought.

            I don’t think this did Hillary any good other than keep her in the race.  In some ways, it is the best thing that could have happened to Trump.
If Hillary had been indicted, she would be replaced with a far more electable candidate.  Instead, she was damaged, her lies exposed, and Trump supplied with a massive amount of ammo to use against her.

                Yeah, because we all know that Trump is going to win. President Trump!What the fuck is wrong with all you jackasses? The United States of America is going to elect an orange faced weasel that never had to work a day in his life? Didn’t we already suffer eight years of a man that could not string a sentence together; a man that practically bankrupted the country before riding off into the sunset?President Trump! You’re all a bunch of fucking ass clowns belly moaning about how the government is against you. Is that the best your pathetic minds can conjure? You’re a fucking loser so of course it must be the government’s fault! Grow up! Get real! Hillary Clinton and her thug-ocracy are blackmailing the FBI… Don’t you ever listen to yourselves?Why don’t you just climb aboard the space shit that’s following that comet and get the fuck out of here! The government is corrupt? The government is incompetent? Okay, let’s elect a crooked jackass for president; that’ll set things right!What the fuck is wrong with you douchebags? Try not to blow your faces off when you’re cleaning your guns!

                    Know why telling me not to vote for Donald Trump, or Donald Trump would not make a decent President is wrong? It is not because you are right or wrong, but because you are wrong because you are telling me I have to do something against my best interests. And nothing, nothing could be as wrong as that.

        Here’s another take from Diplomad 2.0This also is something a lot of the folk over at theconservativetreehouse are talking about.This is an outake from the middle of his post:~~~~~~~Whatever his own “intent,” however, Comey has slipped Hillary a poison political pill mixed in with the heady “no prosecution” bourbon. In the first 12 or 13 minutes of his presser, Comey described a factual situation and a pattern of behavior by Clinton far, far worse than most of us had imagined. Everything, absolutely everything, Hillary said about this matter is a demonstrable lie. Comey called her on it. He provided a picture of a senior official totally unqualified for the serious position she held, and surrounded by equally as unqualified and incompetent staff. Comey, I repeat, powerfully made the case that she is not qualified for high office. Perhaps this was Comey’s Machiavellian maneuver: avoid the legal process but cripple Hillary politically? Maybe he was like a mad Solomon, to wit, actually splitting the baby?~~~~~~~Trump is gonna have a field day with all the dirt Comey dished out yesterday.I can’t wait!URL:http://www.thediplomad.com/2016/07/banana-trees-all-way-to-horizon.html

            I don’t know. Trump is so lacking in discipline and so easily distracted that I wonder if he can really make the most of this. Every time Hillary accuses him of something, he responds. She’s in Atlantic City making lame cracks about Trump and casinos and he takes up his day responding. He’s violating the first rule of politics which is to always be on attack. Never explain. Never complain. Always go on attack.I’m obviously rooting for Trump, but we really do deserve a better champion. He should be running on a reform platform talking about immigration, trade, taxes and the epidemic of corruption with Crooked Hillary as the face of that corruption. He should talk of nothing else. Yet, he can’t stay focused for five minutes.

            I think this is exactly the case.  While he patted Hillary on the shoulder and told her “no problem” he nicked her carotid artery ever so slightly as he removed his hand and she will die a slow death.  She thinks she won but she is “Dead Woman Walking.”  Politically speaking.  As for Comey, he didn’t exactly fall on his sword but I am sure hist gesture did not go unnoticed.  How long he has to live … well, we will see.  As I have learned, “not all is as it appears.”

            So far all he’s done with this is a brief tweet and then a lot of talk about Saddam Hussein being a terrific terrorist killer.  In fact, every time he has a chance to take advantage of another Hillary revelation he instantly deflects discussion from it with another of his insane accusations/speculations/conspiracy theories that have nothing at all to do with the latest atrocity committed by She Who Must Be Obeyed so the media quickly runs after that garbage.

        The remarkable career, riches, malfeasance,  and continual promotion  of Jamie Gorelick must alone convince us that permanent government is corrupt at the root. Hillary’s rise reaffirms what needs no proof,  that incapacity is no bar and failure a recommendation. It is reassuring to the millions employed in government to know that all are safe from judgement.

        Was around some leftists last weekend.  They seemed schizophrenic – completely unable to process how bad a candidate their wagon was hitched on to, yet unable to do anything except talk politics.  I felt kind of bad and worried for them.  When I tried following their ideas to their logical conclusions, they freaked and changes subjects (talking points really).

            I wonder about our worn down military. What if the seals and special forces decide not to trust her with the security they must have?  I could not blame them. They have suffered too many losses under questionable circumstances. Not a good time to have a toothless pack of jackals in congress.

                That’s my worry too.  The US military has a long tradition of not playing politics…. at least, according to them.  The election of 1864 says otherwise.  Not everyone at the Pentagon is a fool; not all staff officers are time-servers.  I’d expect it in Europe before here, but at some point, the Army is going to have to get nakedly political to protect itself.  That won’t be fun.  It’ll be interesting to see who Trump starts touting as his future cabinet — the VP pick will (or should be) a sop to actual conservatives (say, Jeff Sessions)… but what if the rest of them are recent vets?  Fun times.

                        At this point, with the house cleaning Obozo has done of any good military leaders, I hope those “generals” are “retired.”  I would have my doubts about anyone currently serving at the pleasure of this doofus.

                    Don’t confuse the U.S. Armed Forces with, say, the German Army of 1926.  Our military is full of squirrels, top to bottom.  Some can do more pushups than others.  The good news is that the military is so ill-disciplined, so ill-trained. so socially engineered and so poorly led that if the Powers that Be attempt to use it to put the hammer down, nobody knows what will happen.

                        Which was exactly the problem in 1933 with the German Army.  The deciding factor in making Hitler Chancellor was the army’s declaration that they probably couldn’t put down a nationalist putsch should the Nazis get frozen out of the cabinet. Would the Army actually deploy to put down domestic insurrection?  Would the National Guard actually fire on protestors?  As I say, I’d expect it in Europe before here, but I’m certain we’re going to get the answers to those questions much sooner than later.  And one doesn’t get to be a general by being bad at politics.  You don’t need a Napoleon to bring down a government; an Ishiwara Kanji will do just fine.

                            Would the US Army deploy against US citizens? I’d say it is highly unlikely that such a point would ever be reached. We see the national guard out in disasters and we see them at airports, but they are expecting full cooperation from the public. I think the highest reaches of the military assume they would not have any support among their units for deploying against Americans so they would never consider it. Rather, a President who gave such an order would face a revolt of his generals first.That said, contemplating what a modern civil war would be like is an interesting thought experiment.

                                The National Guard actually had the support of most folks when they fired at Kent State. People were tired of the rioting, especially on campus. We aren’t there yet, but the conventions are coming up and we have two shootings that should start protests this week.

                                The “revolt of the generals” scenario is largely what I was getting at.  As the Cloud People move ever further from the Dirt People, they forget that the Dirt People make up the Other Ranks.  Not all generals are Cloud People (or, at least, some still have sufficient contact with Dirt People to remember this basic fact).  A few generals letting President Hillary know that thus-and-such is out of the question would be… interesting, to say the least.

                                You have to think like a globalist. That is what “Peace Keepers” are for. Round up some particularly fearsome solders from various banana republics, put a blue surf helmet on them, promise them land and white skinned brides, and send them into the “Unsecured Spaces” with a few levels of plausible deniability, like having “Special Agents” from the ATF or FBI operate as handlers with cutouts right to the oval office, to help quell the white southern racists killing and enslaving black lives matter and transgender cry bullies.Stalin had great success killing the Kulaks off, it is pogrom 101.

        I personally find it liberating. Of all the insidious constructs of this system of administrative tyranny to do so, it is serendipity the FBI, what was billed in it’s birth as the penultimate arbitrator of enforcing the rule of law, declared not only it and every component of the state lawless, “officially”, they declared a state of Anarchy exists. Mark my words, they did a coup on themselves. They are so utterly corrupted by what they are, so blinded by trying to survive their illegitimacy, they don’t even know they are their own worst enemy. If you want to know what SHTF looks like, you are witnessing it in living color.It is beautiful.No laws count but natural law and primal rights of men, they ripped up that parchment and lit it on fire. They declared in no uncertain terms they and the rest of the actors of who comprise the federal government function in a state of the law of the jungle. It’s done. It is the penultimate act of dissolution of the appearance of legitimacy and the tiny thread of power of a government originally predicated entirely and only on the consent of the governed. There can be no doubt as to redressing and restoration of what once was. It is a new day, a new age. The rebirth of the rights of men.Does anyone else here sense being absolved?I find a new day has dawned. I’m released from my responsibilities as a citizen of what was once the United States of America. I am a totally Free Man. Viva La Liberty!

                Yes, salient point. Lot of people are afraid of freedom. You have to be very accountable and responsible if you are truly free.It scares the bejesus out of some folks. But that is the beauty of rightful liberty, you are responsible, for what you do. Is there need for the state as we know it when people live true liberty?I think one of the possible futures small is nation states, possibly similar to the Compact of Confederation arise. There are already grass roots movements towards small nation states. The Free State Project in NH, Texit, the communities coalescing up in Idaho, Montana. Even Brexit is the nascent act of secession from and abolition of the leviathan state. Spain and it’s Catalonia movement, Iceland has literally thrown the bums out or put them in prison.In WV where I live, up in these ridges and hollows, people are about as secession minded as people I can think of. If it all dropped in the pot tomorrow, hardly nobody would notice, or even care. Since the coal mines have been forced to close, the county is destitute, the State is in dire straights. Talking all but bankrupt. We have 4 deputy Sheriffs for an area the size of half of NH. And they are on from 8am to 5pm mon-thurs. You wouldn’t know it. Everyone is on their best behavior, it’s tribal knowledge you screw with somebody Hillbilly Justice and the hillbilly grapevine will deal with you.Frankly, I’m born and raised in northern NH, I find it refreshing and a wonderful community system of people self determination/regulation. It’s tribal in many ways. It works amazingly well. There was that when I was a younger man in NH, but it has withered on the vine to a certain extent. In WV it is much like the life of my childhood up north. It’s a system of respect and honor. When it flooded here couple weeks ago, the outpouring of generosity and help people extended to neighbors was instantaneous and overwhelming. But this community spirit is a constant also. Folks watch out for each other in these mountains. They take a care to do so. It is an inherent component of the culture. No government or state can do this, and it has no business substituting itself for it.  So much of America scoffs at Hillbilly’s, denigrates their culture and heritage. They don’t know what they are missing.It is no wonder to me, and I’m a died in the wool Yankee, why the South seceded from the North. No government is meddling in our way of life here, its grass roots all the way. Agrarian in many ways too, another natural characteristic of rightful liberty.I believe, I see it, these are things people who are responsible and live in freedom unfettered do, I think because liberty is a we are all in this together kind of thing.

                    In my experience a promiscuous love of freedom is abundant. Too many who love freedom fear liberty. It should be the other way around.

                            You have inherited the several rights necessary to successfully work for the innumerable necessities and pleasures of life, and likely are responsible for family as well.  That is liberty. A successful criminal has perfect freedom. He gets up when he wants, sleeps when he wants, takes what he wants when he wants it. The freedom from want is part of the living Constitution, circa 1933. Rights that are measured in personal responsibilities are liberty.

                            Sharia law isn’t self rule, it is about as draconian subservience to a cult as it gets, so me personally I couldn’t even begin to compare liberty to it. But that is just me.Secession and Abolition crazy?A crazy idea sovereignty of the people, shall not be infringed, and unalienable God given rights of liberty and self determination is wrong and not possible?Heh.Now lets see, mmm, wasn’t there a bunch of guys from about 1680’s through the 1700’s who had the same crazy ideas, they sure where some sacked out extremists. Seems like they where pretty successful at consent of the governed replacing the world largest empire with will of the people and self determination.Liberty is dangerous. But right there is the beauty of it. You get to have a gun, say what you like, give the powers that be the finger, make moon shine, grow marijuana, refuse to be taxed, build the castle of your dreams, and make money any way you like and keep every penny of your wealth to use as YOU see fit, long as your not hurting’ another guy. What is most dangerous is your responsible for everything, and your going to get your arse blown away and take a dirt nap if your not careful and caring of others. Which is if you think about, is not a problem and if anything when you figure out how liberty works, the exact opposite is true and most everyone involved sticks together gets along because that is how it works.Liberty is a everyone is in it together one way or another kind of thing in this world now. There is those who want liberty, and those who don’t. Is there really any middle ground on this.Though some BS themselves and others they can sit on the fence with their finger in the air and reap the wind, or have this retarded idea they have some special power to tell everyone else what they can or can not do.And that is what is crazy right there.

                        May I recommend this short story to you. As you say, “it is a pretty good description”, of withdrawal of consent. It also has within it’s pages “the most powerful weapon ever devised.” I read it as a kid, and the idea of consent in Frank Russell’s masterpiece has stayed with me to this day 50 years later. It is a fun yarn too. Russell also wrote ‘Wasp’, an entertaining instructional fiction on defiance to the state.‘And Then There Were None’http://www.abelard.org/e-f-russell.phpThere is a really dynamic fellow up in Idaho, goes by the avatar John Mosby, (the original J Mosby was a small unit infantry commander during the civil war who fought a brilliant guerrilla campaign against the federals), former special forces non com, teaches small unit infantry tactics to civilians. From some things he has spoken of, I think he has a classical education in Latin and history. He wrote something that makes a great deal of common sense in relative terms:“Remember:The fundamental human right to self-defense and its tools does not stem from any piece of parchment or other act of man.It is much more elemental than that.I have more principled reasons for my stand on owning firearms, and I don’t care one whit in the world for the Second Amendment. It means nothing to me. My rights have nothing to do with the U.S. Constitution, and when it dawns on people that it has finally been erased — the principal danger of all political premises posed as “social contracts” — my rights will still validly exist, even if I die defending them. I own firearms because I have a right to private property. That is the First Thing.…As the Regime takes off the gloves, every day it creates tens of thousands more American Patriots who realize yes, it really probably is going to get that bad, so really, they may not have that much to lose after all.So why not stop being afraid and stand up to the Regime?Join the honorable Resistance, or make your own. Garden, cook at home, teach your children, and get right with the Lord. Cut expenses, avoid taxes, learn new skills, and build savings of tangible real assets. Train, stockpile, recruit, prepare, guard, protect, and defend.Make this your finest hour.Word.”(Not too shabby for a grunt and a white right wing Christian extremist domestic terrorist. I’ve met this fellow. He is about as humble and soft spoken as they come. Till he picks up a rifle and shows you how to move with it.)

                        That John Mosby who wrote the bit about joining the honorable resistance is a really sweet hearted guy. I think he is probably tougher than woodpecker lips when it comes to combat, but he has this heart of gold. If you don’t know of him, I believe he was one of if not the first ex military combat veterans to train every day citizen’s in armed defense using small unit infantry tactics.Here’s his blog:https://mountainguerrilla.wordpress.comThere is another fellow along the same lines as John, Max velocity, Max has a training complex in Romney WV.http://www.maxvelocitytactical.comBoth guys have written extensively on the subject and on liberty also. They have some unique insights. Both are men are very well educated and have considerable experience. I can’t recommend either man highly enough. The training is a sublime experience, transformative.Max is originally an Officer in the British SOS, his specialty is 4th ten warfare, he immigrated to the US, became a Special Forces Medic, then did a couple tours as an advisor in the mideast.

        A few years ago, I asked myself two questions, and continue to ask them regularly:•  Will the ruling class fight to hold on to power? (Obviously they won’t do it themselves… mercs, etc. are allowed)•  Will the broad masses have any faith in democracy and free-ish markets after a major collapse?I still don’t have answers to either, though after yesterday, the answer to question one is a lot closer to “yes.”As you rightly point out, this isn’t the iron age and the “broad masses” aren’t illiterate plebs thought the ruling elites seem determined to import any number of Syrian slaves to work the latifundia.

            We seem to be into a game of chicken. The ruling class abuses the laws and the public votes them out. Then the ruling class finds new ways to abuse the laws. The voters up the ante on the revolt at the ballot box, going for populist/nationalist parties. It looks like the UK political class is about to ignore the results of the referendum. How long does this keep going on before one side opens fire?What’s striking is the lack of organized protests. The BLM stuff is just a Soros operation using professional protesters. I suspect people have concluded that they will do no good so there is no point. That’s an ominous sign.

                I suspect we will see the government turn guns against citizens. Maybe it’s planned for Cleveland?  it will be a Boston Massacre or Kent State type of event. I still would not be surprised if Obama declared martial law and stayed in office. I don’t think Obama wants to stay on, but his handlers want him in office.

The Bundy Ranch standoff?They already have turned their guns against us citizen’s.Seems like the only gun control problem is the government is pointing theirs at citizens and pulling the trigger.

                        LeVoy Finnicum, Randy Weaver, Waco Texas??? You better step back a lousy cotton pickin’ minute and try to remember why we have a government in the first place.Everybody wants to be free. Everybody wants liberty. But nobody wants some fucktard that thinks he’s Jesus to make babies with twelve year olds. Nobody wants some cowboy that thinks he’s decoded the Secret Constitution to take over a wildlife refuge. There are 320 billion people living in this country and 319,999,988 of them think LeVoy Finnicum, Randy Weaver, and David Jesus Fucking Christ Koresh deserved what they got. Thank you, government, for your service.There are people in this country that have real problems; problems that you don’t want to deal with every day. That’s why we have a government. The government isn’t pointing guns at you. What’s your gripe with the government? Really, what’s your problem?

                                    Well, if the news is any guide at all, the FDA is using their SWAT teams to raid Amish farms for selling raw milk.I expect that the Smithsonian will use their SWAT teams to put down anyone who puts nose prints on the display cases or tries to touch one of the aeroplanes hanging from the ceiling.  Or maybe they’ll use them to protect that one booth in the concession area that sells the deep fried doughnuts.The Animal Inspection Service (which I’ve never heard of before, but whatever, there are probably hundreds of Federal bureaus that nobody’s ever heard of before) is will likely use their SWAT teams to do what most cops seem to do when they encounter an animal in the course of their “duties”, they’ll shoot it a bunch of times and then make the owners sit there and watch them bleed out.It’s for the children, after all.

You can take that to the bank.You made yourself out to be a seriously hateful and heartless person at your statement LeVoy Finnicum deserving what he got. That is despicable.We are all in this together for better or worse. You are wrong, this is all our government and the problems we are facing is not resolved or excused thru summery execution of a fellow American who does not agree or stood up to those problems when no one else had the courage. You should be eternally ashamed of yourself.Sorry, but that is not a government, it is a dictatorship that acts thusly. Care to rationalize that for me?

                            Yup, Vickie Weaver really had it coming, standing inside her own house holding an infant.Thank God Lon was there to put a bullet through her skull (narrowly missing a two for one with the child as well) and protect all gov’t loving Americans from her horrible infant carrying ways.I’ll tell you how dangerous Randy Weaver was:  After they got done killing most of his family, almost killing him, and he was convinced to surrender, they hauled him into court where a jury of his peers acquitted him of all charges, except failure to show up in court the first time, for which he sentenced to 18 months in jail.  And, given that it had taken 15 months for the trial to take place, he was credited with time served plus three months by the sentencing judge and released that same day.Then the gov’t paid him and his daughter $3.2M for depriving his wife and son of their civil rights when they where unlawfully killed.Yup, thank the Lord that the FBI and ATF were there to save us from some random guy who still had an intact family, lived out in the woods, and who most importantly wouldn’t or couldn’t (’cause he wasn’t a member with the connections they thought he had) become an informant for the FBI against some racist assholes (being one of which, BTW, is not illegal . . . yet).

He died for all our freedom from a repressive regime. Liberty for thee, liberty for me. We are all in this together friend. Because as soon as people think they got some special rights begin to decide who lives and who dies, we are all truly in serious trouble. Where does it end? Lots of civilizations have gone down that ugly path, and they are all taking a dirt nap. We are a nation of people, not a government, and as people we are supposed to be above the tyrants running this government, regardless of what they do.And since when is a majority you claim exists, have the power to decide who lives and who doesn’t? That is called mob rule. Not America, certainly not liberty, and by no stretch of dissonance is there any precedence or sanction in our founding rule of law for summery execution even in a capitol crime.

                            I never read a comment before that revealed that an American citizen has no problem with the federal government summarily executing other citizens. A US Marshall killed Weaver’s 14-y-o son, a known psychopathic killer, and his dog then the awesome FBI sniper Horiuchi took the FBI shoot-to-kill ROE to heart and blew off the jaw of the notorious low life Vicki Weaver. Finnicum was committing no crime but was shot down like a rabid dog. And incinerating those 12-year-olds as part of an armored assault on civilians is the way to handle whatever problems existed in that redoubt? What kind of horse’s ass are you?

That they violated the law doesn’t mean they should be executed. Weaver was in trouble for having a shotgun a inch or so less than legal length, Koresh for gun violations. Who knows if he raped anyone. As for Finnicum I could see shooting it out with him but not after he left and surrendered. I don’t yahoos should be able to enter and hold government property.

                        In all the insanity of the thug-ocracy, who knows what kind of things they will do to keep the reigns of power firmly in their grasp. Nothing seems beyond the pale, and they grow more overt in their violations of the fundamental foundation of republican form of government. The other day was reading a comment on another blog somebody said Clinton could select obama as her VP, then upon being sworn in as POTUS, resign and hand the throne back to him.Far fetched as it sounds, after doing some brief research there is nothing that prohibits such a scenario from taking place. Not that they care if they are criminals and crooks to begin with.These psychopaths are tag teaming us six ways to sunday, and as people begin to become aroused and act in defiance and resist the usurpations of our republic, they will begin to take ever more drastic means, maybe even desperate means to rule us.

            It is through the faith of democracy that we find ourselves exactly where we are, foreign and domestic. Democracy is not Divine. Faith is religious. The Progressive faith is democracy.  Democracy works for the citizen only when it is tightly wrapped in the chains of constitution.  It would be the greatest misfortune to fight a war, cold or hot, to arrive at exactly the point which we left.

            Maybe it takes something like a self-immolation or an old guy with a spear to set it off. I think I’ve speculated here that we’ve kind of reached a critical mass of opiod and and anti-depressant use and that that produces a condition similar to Brave to New World’s soma. I also speculate that the idea of “America” has become somewhat like the idea of “Rome.”  We still had “Caesars” until 1918, and I often suspect that the EU is just the latest attempt to resurrect that rotted corpse.  Maybe folks just cannot imagine a world without America.None of those are good places to be.  So yes, the oracles and auspices are not favorable.

        This today from the great Diana West:~~~~~~~~Of course, “FBI Director” Comey will not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. But that is not what is worst about this latest wretched day in American history.
What child, what babe, what fuzzy bunny ever expected that he would? Who among us examined the facts of the case as they emerged and rested assured that Justice would be done — that is, done blindly, with no special-case, extra-stretchy, wink-wink regard for the Clintons?~~~~~~~~~

        Here’s the other thing I think about. It used to be that, when a new President took office, they cleared out the government bureaucrats and installed people they owed favors to. It was corrupt and offices were filled by the unqualified. It did mean that the bureaucracy was purged. We need to go back to peacefully purging the bureaucracy, before we have to resort to violence.

            The civil service act of 1883 needs to go. Instead of ending the partisanship of the civil service, it has made the civil service all partisans of one side only – the big government party. Imagine if every bureaucrat manager had to fear an opposing partisan taking over his office and looking for malfeasance to prosecute, with the power to fire any employee who didn’t help.  If we went back to the “spoils system” the best job insurance would be competence and strict impartiality.  .

                In the early 1900’s an amendment to the Constitution imposed upon the citizens of the USA a personal and corporate income tax.( Prior to about 1919 or so, there was no income tax of any sort.)That was the beginning of the end of our Constitutional Republic, for it allowed the Federal Government to spend, literally, unlimited amounts of the earnings confiscated from the citizenry. The massive revenue generated by this tax funded and still funds EVERY federal agency and has allowed the Congress to abrogate its responsibilities as the sole law making branch of government. The vast majority of laws imposed upon the citizenry today is generated by the unaccountable, un-elected federal agencies, not the Congress.This tax is also what allows the federal government to grow ever larger, seemingly without limit, furthering the burden placed upon the PRODUCTIVE citizens who are compelled to fund our bloated, criminally negligent federal government and its thousands of agencies (most of which should be immediately abolished.)This tax also allows the political ruling class to dole out favors (to their supporters) by spending other people’s money to  “buy” support by spending other people’s money and very possibly bankrupting the citizenry (nations do not go bankrupt; it is the citizenry who must foot the bill and who pay the ultimate price).Our Constitutional Republic was formed BY THE STATES, and the federal government was to serve at the pleasure of and responsible to the states. The Civil War altered this status quo, for sure. But the Federal power to tax gave the Federal govt. the ability to financially coerce, bribe and blackmail the states and turned our Constitutional Republic into a bureaucratic and elitist tyranny; an illegitimate government.As someone famously said, “the power to tax is the power to destroy, and the Federal Govt. has used this power to destroy our Constitutional Republic.The Constitution has to be amended to return power to the states, to prohibit the establishment of ANY Federal Agency not expressly assigned by the Constitution to the Federal Govt; to allow by majority vote of  Congress and/or the States to overturn any Supreme Court ruling; to allow, by majority vote of the States, to overturn any law passed by Congress; to repeal the personal and corporate income tax and, as originally written into the Constitution, to allow each State Legislature to select their respective US Senators to serve in Congress (which will affirm that the allegiance of each US Senator is to their State, NOT to the Federal govt., not to a “national” political party and not to the ruling elites in Washington, DC)

            Now that Mandate of Heaven is a great and relative parable to our times.The Mandate of heaven is a funny thing when corrupted. It works in reverse. The further the spirit advances in the thought and act of defiance to tyrants, the greater the increase of adversarial nature to eradicating that defiance and resistance becomes. It is an evolution of insurgency that is required, and that it comes in stages, at some point the equation changes, from one of being a subject to tyranny, to one of subjecting tyrants to the motive energy of being so free, freedom can not be resisted any longer.

        One consolation of this affair is that we need not worry about Putin blackmailing President Hillary with the contents of her servers (plural !?).  Blackmail only works if the mark has some sense of shame or something to fear from the legal system from exposure.  We know from 40+ years of exposure that Hilary  has no sense of shame.  And now we know she need have no fear of the legal system.  Perfect_!

        Spot-on analysis!Whatever took place behind the scenes forcing Comey into his strange news conference or as you so eloquently put it ‘erratic’ ended up being the message that the privileged will not face any consequences for their criminal actions. There is no way that Comey and his agents spend as much time as they did to come to such a conclusion of ‘innocence’. The IG report released earlier painted Hillary Clinton as someone not following the rule of law – how could the FBI find her innocent and yet listing her crimes at the same time.I no longer wonder why this administration has been stacking up on hollow point bullets in the millions. I begin to believe that we are being ‘delivered’ to the gods/elites who deem themselves entitled to their ‘one-world-order’. Consider also that this president suppose to keep his own office in DC. What for and why? Looking at the many pics of UN market vehicles/trucks etc throughout the Midwest also tells me that a more sinister plan for us is afoot.

            Comey was forced to conclude not to indict the former Secretary of State because the argument had too many big words that he did not understand. How can you defend yourself against the elite one-world-order when you can’t even pronounce it?
We need to put knuckle heads in charge. Why use hollow point bullets when you can use sticks and stones? We can slash the tires of all those Midwest tractors and trailers with kitchen knives.  Neca eos omnes. Deus suos agnoscet.

        “The ruling class loses the moral authority to rule. Once the ruling elite stops abiding by the laws, their only reason to rule is force. That’s not just an internal reality within the ruling elite; it is a reality within society as a whole.”It’s at least arguable that the ruling class never *have* abided by the laws, and that we are only now becoming aware of it, via the Internet, a communication tool that was not available in the old days.It will be interesting to see them try to rule only through force, dispensing with all pretense of “legitimacy”. Particularly so, since the dirt people are so heavily armed, and can communicate among themselves so easily. The most effective enforcement is that which happens within the peon’s head, and if that is disappearing…

        Yeah, we Americans are being played by a couple of Arkansas crumb bums that are in cahoots with the media to take over the world. The FBI does not recommend strapping them up by their toes and stoning them? What’s the world coming to? How am I ever going to watch I Dream of Jennie in my underwear when these bastards are coming to take my guns away while shoving their health insurance down my damn throat?Here come the dictators with their jigaboo junkies and fascist feminists scrapping the prosperity of the country to charcoal. If Hillary’s elected the citizenry of sanity will save our great nation with heroic debauchery. We will hoist Donald Trump on our shoulders and seat him in the hall of governance where he will issue one-way bus tickets to Panama for all the spick gardeners and masked wrestlers.And anybody that doesn’t love Jesus will be thrown to the lions in our perverted Roman empire. Rub your face in orange shit and make America great again!
