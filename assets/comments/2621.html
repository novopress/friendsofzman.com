        Mormons are, with the exception of Jews, the most successful crew in America. More so if you consider that they take reproduction very seriously.Mormanism has evolved from the ridiculous to the respectable in a mere 150 years.J. G, Frazer-“Superstition rendered a great service to humanity. It supplied multitudes with a motive, if a wrong motive, for right action; and it is better for the world that men should be right from wrong motives than that they would do wrong with the best intentions. What concerns society is conduct, not opinion; if only our actions are just and good, it matters not a straw to others whether our opinions are mistaken.”Unfortunately there is a flip side to what Tocqueville called “custom”-“There are nations whose early education has been so defective and whose character displays such a weird confusion of passions, of ignorance, and of all kinds of false ideas that they could not by themselves perceive the reason for their suffering; they sink beneath unrecognized evils.”We seem to follow a third state of being, a successful custom being systematically destroyed by the intellect.

        maybe next to the golden plates Joseph Smith found out west.I’m not LDS, but even I know that Joseph Smith claimed to find the golden plates that he (and only he) translated into the Book of Mormon in upstate New York…

            Re: Joseph SmithI thought he found them in NY and carried them to Utah. Looking it up I see I was wrong. MY apologies to those who think I should know this. I don’t know much about Mormonism. In school, we were taught about the various Christian sects, Judaism and even the basics of Islam. Mormon were not covered and always considered to be outside of Christianity. That last bit seems to be a big dispute between Evangelicals and Mormons.I’m not sure where the Mormons fit into the religious traditions of the Occident. They do seem like an oulier to me. Maybe I should learn more about them.

        Maybe I’m looking at the NYT graphic the wrong way—and if I am correct me—but those projections are inflation adjusted, whereas government budgets, i.e., receipts and expenditures, are in actual “real” dollars. So are personal income and spending: no one earns or spends fictitious inflation-adjusted money, we spend real money, real dollars.  Between now and 2019, as the Federal Reserve strives to fix its balance sheet, inflation is likely to run healthcare costs up by at least 20% I think, but probably more than that. A healthcare insurance policy that costs someone, say, $11K today will cost more than $13K by 2019, even if the trend in constant dollars is flat over that time period. In other words, in 2019 when the government tallies all the money it collects in taxes that year and all that it spends in every which way it does, there ain’t going to be any savings in healthcare costs. Instead, the inflation goblin is going to eat up all the alleged “savings.”

        The main difference between traditional conservatives and moonbat liberals is that the latter believes in a weird, bad-touchy utopia. Conservatives on the other hand understand that there will always be losers, scumbags and immoral cowards. They aren’t going away, so best to just handle them. Giving them a free hit helps nobody.
And one more little thing, I think Joseph Smith “found” those tablets in New York state.

        And of course the inevitable “rationing”, “wars” over who’s the most worthy “victim” worthy of “special” exception, underground, AND snake oil industries, and expert “licenced, specialist, advisors”-as seen in shopping malls offices and on(ie)tee vee.Gosh, maybe there’s hope for the future of on-line Law/Medical “education” industrial complex, and it’s ancillaries, after all!
