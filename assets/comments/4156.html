        …Haywire indeed!Here’s a couple of ‘mysterious’ items you may find relevant:Note the race of these desperadoes as posted in their descriptions.If you went by the printed descriptions, how many would ever be caught?And this PC crap is going on in supposedly conservative Tejas…http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/Texas10MostWanted/fugitives.aspxand this one:Philadelphia 15-year-olds murdered married father in failed robbery:(At least here they’ve provided photos of the aspiring astrophysicists.)http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/philly-teens-murdered-married-dad-failed-robbery-cops-article-1.2156313?utm_content=bufferedc83&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTwHere’s a friend’s comment about the credulous victim of these miscreants:“As a friend of Jim and his wife I truly hope you aren’t making this an issue of race (if I have misunderstood you I apologize in advance.)Jim was one of the most tolerant loving people I ever met. He wouldn’t be about that. He raised his daughter to be open and loving and I pray to God she keeps her sweet spirit through this tragedy.”And she prays that the now fatherless daughter learns nothing from this event.…

        Ah, we have a similar problem here on this side of the pond. When people are in the news for having committed some sort of atrocity, they are often described simply as ‘British.’ This has become the acceptable speak for, say, a muslim man who has done something uncivilised but happens to hold a British passport as if that is all that it needs to be British. In all fairness, this man may well have been born in these islands and sucked generously at the teat of public welfare — as I say, the State You Hate — but essentially their devotions are not to Britain.So our courts are full of ‘British men’ though occasionally the media relents, or slips, and says something like they are ‘of Pakistani origin’. Of course, this is not helpful and soon many of us will demand that all on trial should be described by their origin. I would be, perhaps, of Saxon origin or perhaps from my tribe. ‘He is a Brit of Icenii origin, your Honour, so we must make allowances.’Yes, that should work.

            UKer, we have the same thing. Whenever the news reports the subject as “a man from a [city of town]”, you know he is a foreigner. It’s a bit of a joke now. On the other hand, if a white guy breaks the law, the local news is erecting billboards with his picture and race.The best ones are when a black teen assaults an old white guy in a “polar bear hunt.” The press will always put in the line, “motivation for the attack is unknown.” Whenever the press is stumped for a motive, you know what it is and it is what you think.
