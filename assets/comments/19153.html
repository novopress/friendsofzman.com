        Someone, I wish I could recall who, quipped (paraphrasing) that commercials debunk the myth of black poverty because every black family in a commercial lives in million dollar home with a father and a mother, two kids and a purebred dog.

            I forget the product, but there is an ad running that features three generations of black men doing something. It was a grandfather, a son and his son. The odds of that happening in real life are a little under three percent. Here is Lagos it is below one percent. That said, I can see the utility of promoting such an image. Black men should be relentlessly shamed into knowing their kids, but that‚Äôs not the point of such ads. They are fantasies for the white people making the ads.

                The only time you see a healthy family it‚Äôs non-White or mixed. The White wahmen are ‚Äúfinding themselves‚Äù backpacking in some exotic location or you‚Äôll have two White men obviously fudgepacking.If you watch older TV shows you see how many more ads there are now too. I‚Äôll watch an hour show from the 60‚Äôs and it‚Äôs fifty-three minutes. Today it‚Äôs what? Ten more minutes of commercials? Even if the show somehow isn‚Äôt pozzed you get a load of it anyway.Kill your Talmudvision subscription. I know the cable company tries to entice you with package deals, but all I want is internet. You couldn‚Äôt give me the electric Jew for free. Check out older movies at the library for free.

                    For myself I didn‚Äôt make any big resolution to kill my TV. Since the late 1990s I‚Äôve just slowly watched less and less. Where I live now I can get fairly affordable fiber internet without being tied to Comcast‚Äôs bundling of TV with internet so I just don‚Äôt have cable and don‚Äôt really even know what‚Äôs on broadcast TV until it gets to YouTube.I think if high speed internet without TV was available to more people a lot more would also just ignore TV entirely. Of course this won‚Äôt prevent YouTube from pozzing us during their ads but that‚Äôs just another point in favor of Gab or something similar starting its own rival to YT.On another note: anybody remember when lefties were the ones wanting us to kill our TVs? I even seem to recall lefty paleo-virtue signallers boasting about how they killed their TV and just read books. As with so many things I‚Äôve seen the roles reverse on this.

                        I remember distinctly, waiting for Neil Armstrong to step out onto the Moon, sitting around the new (my family was late-adapters) color television. The doorbell rang.
The young liberal couple from next door, the only ones who didn‚Äôt go to church in the neighborhood and made sure you knew that they didn‚Äôt have a television, wanted to know, very sheepishly, whether they could come in and watch.

                        Liberals hated TV when it was aimed at the Average American. For example, in the 60‚Äôs you had lots of rural comedies, and the Liberals REALLY hated that.

                When I see ads like that on TV I snicker and say ‚Äúthat never happens‚ÄùThe wife will usually respond and say ‚Äúwhat are you talking about now‚Äù.Me: ‚Äù look at this stupid commercial ‚Äì they‚Äôve got a black kid, with his black father, and the grandfather is there too ‚Äì that never happens‚Äù.She‚Äôll still be a bit perplexed ‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre ranting about now‚Äù‚Äù a black kid whose father is raising him and the black grandfather is ALSO around as well. Three generations of a black family all together ‚Äì how often does that ACTUALLY HAPPEN?  Pretty sure the answer is almost never‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚ÄùThen she‚Äôll try to change the subject.Then when commercial comes on with the white yuppie looking guy whose taking his black daughter to the yogurt shop ‚Äì I do it again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

                        Sigh‚Ä¶Basic Husband has gone all BoomerCon. I‚Äôm now a football widow. He even watched football when Kapernick was taking the knee. He‚Äôs particularly hooked on the 49ers. His 92 YO mother watches too and they text back and forth during games. I can‚Äôt stand the Imperial Capital race mixing commercials, celebrate fat women and gay/lesbian commercials. I read a lot and come January, it‚Äôs back to the gym using up time for me.The Husband has pics of Trump and Devin Nunes on the dining table along with a mini flag. When I dissed Charlie Kirk and walked away from Hannity, he got pissed. If I think of pointing out Bar will probably not deliver, he‚Äôll blow up. Nor can I point out who the majority group is that is saber rattling. We have a bet going on whether Michelle O will enter the race. I‚Äôm betting Yes she will. Once the bet was set, he won‚Äôt talk about it.Basic Husband is particularly testy when I bring up you, Z! Husband proudly declares he‚Äôs a Libertardian, and blew up when I suggested he listen to your podcast on such creatures. He just thinks that if he displays the freedom to swing his arms and others have the same freedom, then he‚Äôs a Libertardian. He has no idea what a Libertardian is. So no more Z for him. Cannot quote you now at all.Z‚Ä¶.I think he is weirdly jealous of you. You guys think you can‚Äôt point out the Poz to your women! Well..this D- Woman isn‚Äôt any more successful than you are unmasking the Poz to my spouse.  The Range is learning to play her cards close to her chest. A good stealth skill to perfect in this declining world. The way it is.

                            RFF, he can‚Äôt be too bad if he‚Äôs with you. When push comes to shove, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll see your way of thinking. Never mind the words you‚Äôll be saying‚Ä¶ Life will show him.Per those who know Michelle Obama, like our Establishment‚Äôs best girl, Dana Perino, there is no chance she will run for president. I believe it. Barack got his money for serving and now they‚Äôre rich and she just wants to enjoy the good life. There enters the drawback when people like Obummer enter into Faustian agreements for piles of money: you are always on-call ‚Äî forever ‚Äî and they will insist you speak publicly or enter service in order to protect and perpetuate the globalist cause. So I bet there is pressure on Michelle Obama to run, that black bitch who hates white Americans and what they stand for.

                                Ursula.  Agree.  She‚Äôs already told herself ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done enough for America by not executing half of them for raycisms.  I have suffered so for America, my dues are paid.  Time to cash in.‚Äù  No way she runs.
If she did, she‚Äôd plumb new depths of unlikeability in record time.  She‚Äôs at least Hillary-tier hateable. She may as well pick Kabbala Haaretz for VP out of the gate and have the hatiest-hateable-hater ticket in U.S. history.

                            Hang in there, RFF.  I have similar issues with my husband, although he is usually happy to listen if I ask if I can read him a Zman post.  He doesn‚Äôt always agree, but he‚Äôll listen to it.  The problem is he doesn‚Äôt connect it to his life.  He agreed with today‚Äôs post re t.v., but insisted ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm always changing the channel, to avoid the crap.‚Äù  He refuses to cut the cord.  He doesn‚Äôt identify as a Libertardian, and is fully on board re race and identity, but still holds tight to capitalism and muh free market.  Just regard hubby as a work in progress.  Mine is always a few years behind wherever I am politically.

                        Well I like to watch the occasional movie on it and there is still some stuff out there that isn‚Äôt pozzed that I like to watch.  Plus I paid for the TV and I‚Äôm not in the habit of breaking my own toys.  I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs pretty effective to just point out the insanity to people ‚Äì and then let it all slowly sink in.  Eventually they get to the point where they‚Äôre figuring it out on their own.

                    Been there. White women want a pat on the head from society. They instinctively know that noticing these things and, even worse, pointing them out will not be good for them socially, so they simply don‚Äôt think about it. Mrs. Citizen isn‚Äôt a big fan of my pointing out the inane stupidity of Nice White Lady shows.

                    I beg to differ with you Carlsdad. I have first hand knowledge of several generations of Joes being together in a group setting. However, it was the result of a block blowing up when a tactical team decided to arrest the youngest of the Orcs. Daddy, granddaddy, and great grandddaddy all poured from the house to defend the poor yewf, who ‚Äúdin do nuffin‚Äù.As a result there were four generations of the same family in the lockup being processed. The fambly that bangs together stays together!And in the end, every one of them had an extensive rap sheet. What is it that Z says about ‚Äúculture‚Äù? Guess it just must be a cultural thang. Gnome sane??

                Z, I always hear this (‚Äúblacks should be relentlessly shamed into knowing their kids‚Äù) from white guys. I get why since it would obviously help the black community in terms of crime and general functioning of life, but in many ways, you‚Äôre thinking and acting like those color-blind and HBD-denying CivNats.What you‚Äôre really saying is that blacks should be shamed into acting more white. But they‚Äôre not white. They‚Äôll never be white. It‚Äôs just like when whites quietly whisper that blacks could do as well at school as whites if they just studied harder. It‚Äôs simply not true. They could do better, but you know what, they don‚Äôt want to.Left to their own devices, black men generally don‚Äôt spend time with their kids. The moms and grandmothers take care of them. That‚Äôs how they want it. Sure, black families were more intact in the 1950s, but that was an alien culture imposed on them, a culture that they dropped as soon as they could.My point is let blacks be blacks, even if that means a lower standard of living and more crime. It‚Äôs their community. Let them live they way that they want. Granted, that community causes problems for our community, but the solution isn‚Äôt futilely trying to change blacks into whites, but separating the communities.

                    It didn‚Äôt help when the federal government started subsidizing this behavior in the 1960s.  Black women do not require black men to commit before sex and children because it pays more if they leave.  If black women had to support their own kids, I suspect it would mitigate the pathology somewhat.

                        Agreed. The govt is actively pushing all people to degeneracy. But at the end of the day, black men don‚Äôt naturally get too involved in the raising of kids. Look at Africa. My point is that whites have to stop trying to remake the world in our image. Let other peoples be what they want.
Of course, we push non-white to act white now because we live around each other and it bothers us when they don‚Äôt act like us. But the solution isn‚Äôt coercion but separation.

                                    Those trends were fresh in like, 1985.
Whites who are about 30 and under right now are much less wiggerfied than older millennials/ late GenX were even as recently as a decade ago.  Young blacks today might be more influenced by Whites than the other way around with them adopting aspects of geek culture, skinny jeans, androgyny. Even today‚Äôs hip-hop is heavily influenced by alt rock/ indie shit.
Ghetto influence in pop culture peaked years ago.

                            Citizen, that is exactly right.  In much of Africa, it is the women‚Äôs job to raise the children while the men are off doing whatever it is that they do.

                            I‚Äôve known more than a few Black folks with intact families and decent incomes . They were functional citizens, decent people but not like Whites and assuming they think like White people do is nonsense.We certainly need as a society to encourage intact families for everyone but its not Y/T‚Äôs job to do this for Black folks.  They don‚Äôt really trust our people with this with good reason.As for the fantasy, 911 on Fox has to take the cake. The Grant Family , Black people, affluent , a police sergeant  and an architect  smart and not a racist bone in their body.  Hell a White guy married in with nary a racial qualm!None of the characters, White or otherwise have a racist thought.It‚Äôs still a great show, good values (courage, friendship. loyalty, service to others) good acting , charismatic cast (including Angel Basset who is great) but the civ nattery makes my teeth ache.

True. We pay the bills, so we can demand that they act how we want. Except of course, that‚Äôs not how democracy works. Z talks about becoming helots some day.
We‚Äôre already helots. It‚Äôs just a question of how much our masters will take from us.

                ‚ÄúThey are fantasies for the white people making the ads.‚Äù 100% correct, based on my experience inside advertising. Advertising is mostly about telling little stories, not selling you stuff.  Furthermore, what ads portray usually reflects merely the biases of the advertiser paying for the ad. If the advertising managers at Next Awesome Product Inc. believe that some particular bit of poz is chic, the ad agency will sell you that.There is an ad running for a pharmaceutical that features a clean cut white dad going out for family fun with a very young vibrant daughter, possibly adopted. How this arrangement relates to the efficacy of a new drug is a matter left unanswered. I call it the ad for the David French Pill.

                Blacks gonna black.  But for their tiny smart fraction, it takes iron-fisted rule to keep them in line.  South Africa style, and even then the demographics caught up with them.  Separation is the best kind of apartheid.  We‚Äôre eventually going to have to Lesotho our orcs in America and let nature take its course over a long timeline.

                It‚Äôs remarkably unfair to expect an 85-IQ people to handle financial issues. Let on their own, blacks would create a very simple society that fits their abilities. As Sailer has noted, for our entire society, the right half of the bell curve has abandoned the left half over the past 50 years. Instead creating a world in which both sides can thrive, we‚Äôve made society ever more complicated to take advantage of them.
But that‚Äôs what happens when you no longer think of yourselves as a people, a family.

                    There‚Äôs something to be said for that.  As Z has said before, slavery worked for a portion of that population who can‚Äôt handle modernity, not that anyone wants the responsibility or baggage that comes with shepherding today‚Äôs farm equipment-tier Blacks.
The only ‚Äúinhumane‚Äù aspect of apartheid is leaving less-capable Blacks to the mercies of their own communities.  But the alternative is the destruction of Whites along with their rescue-exotics.  Not acceptable.

            Its not just the liberal social engineering and fantasy.  Marketing research proves that Blacks will buy more of product when you have blacks in the commercials.  Whereas white consumers don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs in the commercials. Most Normie Whites have been brought up to have positive feelings about black folks.  (Quick, name me the last Movie that had black villain and a white hero).  So, there‚Äôs that.

                What product do blacks buy more of (in total, not per capita) than whites? Malt liquor? Realistic marketing would be pitched at white normies. Even with the middle class close to collapse, whites are the big spenders even if they have to borrow to do it.

            Show me on the doll where all of these corporations you‚Äôre referring to are 100% being funded by the government (and therefore your tax dollars)‚Ä¶..  and then maybe you‚Äôll have a point.But until that day ‚Äì the corporations stay in business by giving somebody what they want ‚Äì otherwise they don‚Äôt get paid.  Just because it‚Äôs not what you want ‚Äì is irrelevant.  I think Dodge trucks are pieces of junk.  But decade after decade they just keep producing them and people keep buying them.It‚Äôs not a free market problem ‚Äì it‚Äôs a stupid consumer problem, or probably more accurately these days:  An I don‚Äôt give a shit consumer problem.Figure out why so many people are willing to put up with so much abuse and you‚Äôll be able to change the world.

                    Government run economies and economics simply don‚Äôt work.  I see a bunch of people in this tread pissing and moaning about corporations ‚Äì but they can‚Äôt seem to admit that corporations ALL OF THEM ‚Äì are relatively easy to eliminate ‚Äì just stop buying their shit.  That‚Äôs something you simply cannot do with any level of government.  Go try telling your town ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt plow my road, I don‚Äôt use your schools, and I my house is built out of stone so I don‚Äôt need your fire department ‚Äì therefore I‚Äôm not paying my property taxes‚Äù.And then let me know what happens.Not getting exposed to corporations is VERY easy.  Stop searching thru Google.  Stop buying shit from Amazon.  Don‚Äôt post stuff on Twitter.  If you don‚Äôt like the liberal agenda of the Ford Foundation ‚Äì stop buying Ford vehicles ‚Äì etc.Your options to oppose corporations are a multiple.  Your options to oppose governmental power are almost nil.When I see people who refuse to admit this ‚Äì all I can think of is that what‚Äôs really going on here is just the next iteration of Conservative Inc.  ‚Äì with a new line of bullshit to peddle to the masses ‚Äì this time in TOTAL deference to government power.No thanks.

                You‚Äôre both correct.
LTSs complaint was about commercials being propaganda, and probably turning off more people as a result than  the number of new customers they create.
You are correct that a business is selling what a customer wants.  In this specific case it is the ad agency selling what the marketing buyer or ceo wants ‚Äì a reinforcement of his own moral superiority.  The potential customers the ads are ostensibly aimed at are a third or fourth level consideration at best.

                        IMO both you and ‚Äúthey‚Äù are buying into homo economics to too great a degree.The corporations are neither good not bad.  They‚Äôre tools.  Wielded by executives.  Who can realistically be categorized as a class of people in the same vein as national pols and their media propagandists.   Theoretically that doesn‚Äôt matter because the executives are driven by the necessity of maximizing shareholders economic value.  But As they say, in theory theory and practice are the same in practice they are not.I do agree that the easy solution is to turned the damned boxes off.   Works at the individual level ‚Äì not so much at the societal level.

            Of course corporations go out of their way  to shape our tastes and values. They have to in order to sell us shit we don‚Äôt need.They most assuredly do not give us what we want but what they are selling. Why do you think PR/Advertising is a $200 billion a year industry.Take Apple, Jobs created a cult following around vastly over priced products made by Chinese slave labor in  a country no better than North Korea.  A true triumph of bullshit and marketing.Nike is no different. They convinced people that tennis shoes that cost them $5.00 a pair to make  by 3rd world peasants are worth $100-200.00 a pair.Take designer clothes. Simply slapping a designer label on sweat shop made clothes allows a company to ass rape the consumer. All thanks to slick marketing.

            Government-Corporate ‚Äúlibertarianism‚Äù was invented to diffuse the nationalist sentiments of 1910 libertarians, of Tenth Amendment libertarians, the same as Buckley Conservatism was.
A corporation is a fictional legal entity, same as a government agency is.  Neither are born citizens.

            LineInTheSand:  Very true.  There have been numerous dissident right posts illustrating this ‚Äì lost revenue on movies or t.v or books that have been pozzed.  The point is (((they))) have enough money that pushing their messages of degeneracy and defeatism are far more important than adding a few more shekels.   Sure, there will always be people who will watch whatever they‚Äôre pushing, but that passive acceptance is not the same as active consumer demand.

            I wonder if there are two reasons for these types of commercials: 1) Appealing to upper middle class and wealthy suburbanites who consume a lot and are socially liberal 2) Gain favor with the rabid left to keep them off their backs

        We pulled the plug a while ago, and then after having kids we thought, well what can it hurt a little tv here and there (lazy parenting). Our kids to into addicts always asking for the idiot box, having tantrums when we refused. Then my wife decided one day enough is enough (stay at home mom) and we killed it as well for the kids. They are happier, reading, playing and sometimes being bored ‚Äì but at 3 and 5 that can just mean go outside and play. For us adults in the house we do a bit of Netflix now and again, but its so hard to find a show thats not somehow glorifying degenerative culture. Back to the books for us too‚Ä¶ Makes for better relationships in the evening between spouses.

                About 14 months ago I bought Hulu for $39.99.  Six months later it was $34.99.  Two weeks ago I cancelled when they announced I had to renew at $44.99.  When I move way up north in 20 days I won‚Äôt be getting any services except internet, cell, and landline.  It‚Äôs good to be busy and meeting with people in small groups, and end the day with reading and classical music.  Regarding your article, when I was raising 3 kids as a single father, whenever they started to argue with each other, I assigned them chores to do, and they would diligently do them.  When they were done, they were once again peaceful and non-argumentative.

            We have Hulu, Amazon prime, and Netflix.  99% of it is subversive garbage.  I watch a few older movies, the occasional documentary, Cops, and Live PD.  Between Culver Military Academy for high school, University, and eight years in the Marine Corps, I spent nearly two decades of my youth watching zero television.  Reading non fiction has remained a life long joy and I have more reason now than ever to complete one to two books every week.  The wife loves watching moronic chick shows that I simply cannot tolerate.  I‚Äôm afraid the appeal of most television programming is utterly inexplicable to me.  The degenerate commercials stimulate a cortisol and adrenaline dump that will surely shorten my lifespan if I allow myself too much exposure.

        There must be a plantation of mixed surrogates in California spawning all the females in commercials since they are light caramel skinned, white featured, young pretty-faced mulatto‚Äôs with that frizzy/puffy hair (I‚Äôm told that is called a ‚Äúcomb-out‚Äù since that is what occurs when the braids are combed out of  negro  hair).And about 70% of ad actors are black, mostly female especially the portrayals of doctors, teachers, lawyers, and scientists.  And as Sleepy pointed out they all live in beautiful million or more dollar homes.  No ghetto blacks here.   No fat ugly angry black women either.Almost every new show on regular TV features a black star, again usually a female, good looking and smarter than every white ever born.   The men are either complete idiots if the‚Äôre white,  or evil abusive bastards.  If they‚Äôre black they are wise beyond their years, professionals and all have white or Asian female interests.   The mixing is ridiculous.   There are more mixed couples portrayed on TV than exist in America (sarc.).The message isn‚Äôt subtle, it‚Äôs blatant.  If one wants a career in acting in 21st century America one needs to be anything but a white male.

Weirdly, she specifically mentioned to me that she was mulatto ‚Äî twice. Like it was supposed to be significant.

            Slightly off topic:  When black chicks have blonde hair ‚Äì is that ‚Äúcultural appropriation‚Äù ?
I‚Äôve been wondering that ever since I saw a bunch of blacks getting all pissed off over some white guy who had dreadlocks.

                I don‚Äôt know about appropriation, but it looks ridiculous.  Ladies, unless you are castizo-light-skinned or straight up white, don‚Äôt try this.  I know Italian and Spanish (actual) chicks who can‚Äôt pull this off.  Blonde hair with dark skin looks about as natural as green or purple hair.

As our host said, the ads are fantasies for the white people making them. That holds for their fellow travelers in the audience, too.
The black women in ads so frequently have this appearance because that is how the white progressive woman imagines her ideal black friend.

            I remember not long ago when National Geographic, Time, and the rest had a hardon for the future browning of America. Their graphics and photo collages Probably base on AI ‚Äúpredicted‚Äù that everyone would look pretty much like those fuzzy headed cafe con leche types that are doing all the print and tv ad work.It is no accident. Z is right about the white guilt. Especially white women (shoppers). They get all tingles over these mulatto women. Makes them feel woke and cosmopolitan.But there Is also the propaganda of softening whites toward accepting out minority status and the righteousness of admixing us into the global color of choice.Oprah was early on this stuff. Made her bank.

            ‚ÄúBlue Bloods‚Äù is one of the few shows that promote traditional values (family prays together at Sunday dinner.) There were things I liked about ‚ÄúThis is Us‚Äô. The dad is a Vietnam vet who saves his family from a fire and then dies saving the family dog. The adopted black child being the smartest and most stable of the ‚Äútriplets‚Äù was a stretch, but hey they got lucky and won the gene lottery. Now the 13 year old granddaughter decides she‚Äôs gay and parents and extended family are all fine with it. Time to watch the old ‚ÄúBlue Bloods‚Äù and ‚ÄúOffice‚Äù reruns again.

        When I see members of my family huddled around the TV on Sundays I just shake my head and walk by because I know I‚Äôll never be able to convince them of what they‚Äôre really doing to themselves.I haven‚Äôt watched TV in years and I avoid visiting establishments that display TVs. I‚Äôve more-or-less reprogrammed myself to instinctively avert my eyes whenever I see a large screen. There‚Äôs a weird sense of fear/disgust when I turn my head and suddenly realize there‚Äôs a turned-on television in my line of sight, like my soul is going to be sucked out or something. It‚Äôs honestly not a bad defense mechanism to have considering how hard the media class is trying to propagandize everyone.But since all there really is to do in flyoversuburbville, and all most average chuds do, is go to bars or restaurants and watch tv, I don‚Äôt really leave the house anymore except to go grocery shopping or take a hike by myself. I can‚Äôt relate to anyone around me, even the Whites, because it seems that all people connect over these days is whatever latest media they‚Äôve consumed. Even the church I used to go to has a giant monitor next to the pulpit now. I never could‚Äôve imagined the kind of isolation I‚Äôd bring just by cutting myself out the pozzed entertainment loop, but here I am.

            You will get used to it, Kindola. I adjusted by diving into my Bible and focusing on self improvement. At my age it is kind of late, but the social vacuum out here is no worse that that inside the hive, truth be told. And ‚Äì it‚Äôs far more healthy if you make the effort to make it so. Getting off the couch and hiking beats sitting on it and drinking beer and eating potato chips.Don‚Äôt be afraid to look around for a new church either. There are plenty of others that see what is going on and are actively rejecting it as we do.

            Kindola. You are not alone, but indeed in the minority.Watching my parents, and now just my mom, commit slow suicide by TV and lethargy, was a big motivator in my own cord cutting and rejection of the culture at-large.Even business. I have also stepped away from mainstream biz bit when I do get pulled in I can‚Äôt believe how faggy and banal it is.When I first started my career in the mod ‚Äò90‚Äôs PC was a big thing but it was more like looking out for the cops while you drank by the river.We talked about work stuff and getting laid. Talked shit about the competition. The usual stuff. A lot like my old locker room in college.Now the young guys are talking about Taylor Swift, some gay TV show, and food. Their business chatter is about their plight to network or build their personal brand. Its cringe inducing.Dont even get me started on the broads. They are either bitter ball busters or basically instagram cam whores with business cards.There are exceptions, of course. And those are the ones I gravitate toward. Then I mine them for the secrets they possess: how they are not full pozz.Not surprisingly it is intact families, good relationship with father, and some kind of hobby or other time consuming thing that takes them away from the culture for chunks of time.So keep up the good fight, engage in those things that matter to your values, and take up hobbies that operate outside the rot.You will find your people again. Still hurts to leave loved ones behind but have faith that they too will find their way ‚Äì or some kind of peace, when the time is right for them.If not, well cancer takes a lot of good people too. Savor the good moments and file away the rest as motivation to build the good life for yourself and those who you invite into what you have built.

                When you can enjoy the quiet outdoors, all by yourself, you have hit that ‚Äúas good as it gets‚Äù zone.  You have to train yourself to do it.
I suspect hunters and fishermen get that, too.  They are just framing and justifying the moments with the quest.

                        I used to enjoy the 7-8 hour drive to and from college as a time to think and be by myself, no radio necessary.

I have plenty of buddies who you could uncharitably call ‚Äúshallow,‚Äù but they‚Äôre whole people, not soulless NPC‚Äôs. You can tell the difference on a gut, animal level ‚Äì a kind of repellent shallow ‚Äúun-life.‚Äù

                I‚Äôm another rugby guy. Played a bit and then refereed a bit more. Can‚Äôt quit watching, even as the game has become pozzed.
For the recent World Cup, Australia had to leave one of their stars at home because he believes what the Bible says about homosexual behavior.
I got to thinking. Sports are having to go farther and farther to prove they aren‚Äôt tainted by association with all of their straight, white male fans.
What next? Players engaging in intercourse at halftime? Maybe at some future Big Game President Butt-plug could spit out the first load.

            That works for me Whitey.   I was sitting in my Club on a Sunday watching a game with some of the members in 1999 when it dawned on me I was patronizing a gaggle of anti American, anti white multimillionaire blacks playing a kids game for a bunch of Billionaire Jewish owners who also hate my guts and that was the end for me.   I no longer go to taverns during games.  ANY games.   Even the beer ads have become offensive to me.

        On Hockey Night in Canada, every ad featured a black male, white female couple ‚Äì as if the viewers watching the Toronto Leafs in rural Ontario wanted this. This year, they‚Äôve switched to Asians being in almost ever commercial for some reason. Still aliens.Hockey is good because they can‚Äôt get non whites to play it. However, I suspect that the ptb are just going to destroy it. If you can‚Äôt co-opt, destroy. Any gathering of white men is clearly a sinister white nationalist plot.Cord cutting has been great for my mental health. I cringe now when I hear middle aged white men talking emotionally about football.   Another bang on column, Z. Put away that idiot box, and grow a chest.

            Hockey is one of the last bastions of men-being-men in our modern society in which real hardship and existential threat have become extinct. Do not let it die. Winters can be tough in Canada and the weak tended to die off quickly in the old days. You are descended from the toughest of those survivors. Hockey should be learned on pond ice with a 50 mph subzero wind in your face. Modern fitness selection.

            Funny UFO, I was passing thru a pub for a quick ale with a client and hockey was on the big TV. No sound though.I just glanced up a few times, as the moth brain is wont to do, and they were apparently doing some protracted ball washing piece about some black player who is undoubtedly one of only a handful in the game. Just like the NFL is doing this year vis a vis the black QB.So yeah, if they can‚Äôt turn it they will break it.As for cord cutting I have noticed that it is a kind of fake and gay virtue signaling now to announce how you don‚Äôt ‚Äòwatch tv‚Äô or ‚Äòown a tv‚Äô among the proggy class, especially millennials.This is kind of along the same lines as the claim that millennials dont consume as much, or rather, have as many things.But in fact it is just a facade. Like most of their life.They don‚Äôt have a tv but they have a new $900 phone the size of a ham sandwich, an ipad or kindle ($300), a laptop ($1,000), and subscriptions to Amazon Prime ($15/mo), Hulu ($40/mo), apple tv, netflix ($20/mo) you tube tv, etc.And they watch plenty of garbage based on how much they talk about it.So the cord cutting is really becoming converged into signaling a higher form of consumer class.They aren‚Äôt cable watching flyover proles, no they are evolved curators of their own content choices.Which does not bode well. Just one more facade of freedom that is actually a trojan horse of big data driven programming tailored to their individual weaknesses.

            I always find it strange how middle-aged, seemingly intelligent professional men can talk about the on-field exploits of Laquan and Jamal with such seriousness and gravitas. Any sportsball discussions (if you have them at all) should be done with a sense of bemused detachment. Just saying those goofy ‚ÄúAfrican-American‚Äù names out loud should elicit a little chuckle.

        I pulled the plug when we first moved to AK in the 90s.  It was a case of doing the right thing for the wrong reason ‚Ä¶ cable TV was too expensive so we dropped it.  When we came back to CONUS we opted to reconnect the cable box and wereshockedby the inanity.  The 2-year fast had changed us, so we disconnected cable and never went back.  It‚Äôs the best thing we ever did for our children.Television is a sociological tool ‚Äì a propaganda tool.Their main task is keeping the simple-minded, almost retarded, white males under control.And it works supremely well.  There are a lot of whites with their knickers wadded up about Chik-Fil-A‚Äôs capitulation to faggotry ‚Ä¶ and then they go back to watch tee-vee shows replete with buggery and the normalization of family dysfunction.  Is it hypocrisy or retardation?Been awhile since I read the dystopian novels but I seem to recall that Huxley‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrave New World‚Äù is a bit closer to today‚Äôs reality than Orwell.  The opiate of the masses is television. Orwell‚Äôs boot isn‚Äôt on our neck, it‚Äôs Huxley‚Äôs enslavement to perpetual amusement.

Aside from the endless degeneracy, it‚Äôs such an enormous waste of time!  I canalwaysfind something better to do.  If I‚Äôm going to waste some time in front of a screen, it will be reading evilracissbadthink online or doing genealogy.

            Absolutely. I was just sharing a beer with a buddy the other night. We talked about just that. I have been out of the kulture and its entertainment tentacles for well over 10 years. Plunging back in for weddings, parties, sports events, etc is nearly unbearable. The ugliness is rampant. But what gets me is that people don‚Äôt seem to notice.Football is painful to watch for many reasons. The latest one that makes me cringe is the excessive celebration of even routine plays. It is juvenile and even feminine how they all run around then do some ‚Äòpose‚Äô for the cameras.Remember when they tried to crack down on that, ‚Äòexcessive celebration‚Äô penalties? They quietly gave in and abandoned that except for the most egregious. Just like schools have quietly abandoned disciplining all POCs.I bought one of those keychain tv killer universal remotes. Now when I am at the airport or a pub or the doctors waiting room, I can turn off the tvs. Interestingly, unless there is a ‚Äòbig game‚Äô in process, people really dont seem to mind.A great weapon of the huxley oppression is how easily we habituate ourselves into accepting our own submission.

                The larger point, though, is that imposed boot-on-the-neck tyranny is rather too easily noticed.  The smart Marxists recognized all the lessons-learned from their earlier catastrophes.  It‚Äôs worth reading up on the Frankfurt School.  Like Huxley, they decided it was much more effective to anesthetize the masses through degraded culture, dumbed-down education, and a myriad of opiates for the masses.  Huxley‚Äôs vision of tyranny was the velvet shackles you‚Äôre referencing ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a tyranny-trap into which sheeple amble.

        The problem with handegg, baseball and, to a large extent, basketball, is that only Americans play it.

Had a couple of white yanks turn up in one of my stores in Yokohama this past weekend. Tourists who wanted to rent bicycles (don‚Äôt offer that service, but directed them to a guy who does) Allegedly they were a married couple, but the ‚Äúdude‚Äù had a lower T count than his lardass of a wife. What‚Äôs worse, they looked like they could‚Äôve been brother/sister. There‚Äôs a certain homogeneity to unhealthy people I can‚Äôt put my finger on, but it used to be infrequent with gaijin visiting nippon. Nowadays it‚Äôs almost the given.

        TV has been a weapon of war since its inception. Maybe by design, maybe by accident.When white flight began in the ‚Äô50s TV was there to keep them occupied in their homes as their cities became overrun by blacks.  When Whites took flight for the suburbs it was the escapist entertainment and the assurances of fatherly and grandfatherly figures that read the news that all was well; so no one felt the need to do anything except sit in their Archie Bunker chair and grouse. It worked so the floodgates opened.Suburbs remained suburbs and never became villages. Our Atomization was born with people watching Uncle Milty, Cronkite, the Honeymooners and The Game of the Week ‚Äì their substitute community‚Ä¶instead of engaged in real community activities with their neighbors or building real community-cultures as we had done since the Pleistocene.Having a television in our homes has allowed our enemies and manipulators to babble in our ear all day long telling us what to think and how to act.  This is why so many of our own tribe are seemingly so useless. Challahwood and associates have had the goyim playing fetch for decades.

            Television would not have taken off (in quite the manner it did) had it not been for the atomizing effects of surburbia, as you stated. James Howard Kunstler has dedicated his career to explaining how disastrous suburbs are on the psyche, and how they are the antithesis of a community structure.I live in a farm house on a few acres in the middle of nowhere (near Lagos), and it is quite pleasant. Recently developers have been razing what used to be farms and are building mcmansionvilles in their place. These sell for over three quarters of a million, are pre-fab and low quality, yet *some* people still buy them.I‚Äôve been seeing more and more of them at my local country market: cold cunty women in yoga pants and an under armour jacket (with expensive designer handbags, shoes, and sunglasses), driving a beemer, Audi, Mercedes, or Porsche, uncontrollable hellspawn children, meek timid feminine men that wear beards to cover their soft fat face.Race incidentally doesn‚Äôt matter too much: white, Oriental, Indian, and negro; the archetype still applies. Perhaps it is the selection factor for the kind of person who would want to live in a mcmansion. These people most assuredly consume massive amounts of television, and pornography for the men.

                    The context of that statement was with respect to the nu-behavior described above. Of course race matters, and I agree with your point entirely; my point (perhaps not worded well) was that the meat grinder of nu-society turns all races into vapid materialistic slaves of common archetypes known as consumer demographics.

                I‚Äôm unfamiliar with K.  but it sounds like he‚Äôs taken up Lewis Mumford‚Äôs criticisms.   Another forgotten figure who should be more widely known and more widely read.Thanks for the suggestion.A taste of Mumford:In the suburb one might live and die without marring the image of an innocent world, except when some shadow of evil fell over a column in the newspaper. Thus the suburb served as an asylum for the preservation of illusion. Here domesticity could prosper, oblivious of the pervasive regimentation beyond. This was not merely a child-centered environment; it was based on a childish view of the world, in which reality was sacrificed to the pleasure principle

                You are looking white urban upper class professionals and they are by nature a  bunch of assholes and snobs who almost all vote Democratic.
The suburbs didn‚Äôt create them, they created themselves. Those men gelded themselves so they could work in corporate America without blowing their brains out. Being lonely they married social climbing bitches who are only attracted to them as long as they make $$$$.
It‚Äôs pretty much a living hell in a gilded cage.

            I think television and widely distributed newspapers mark a unique era in history.
At no time in the history of the world have our rulers been so able to send out one mass message to the masses. And the message went basically uncontested.
The 20th century was the age of propaganda.

            I was doing some shopping at the walmart, another rare occurrence, and saw a young-ish couple wheeling out their giant tv.
They didn‚Äôt even look particularly excited. The same kind of face I see on those people leaving the liquor store down the street with a handle of bottom shelf on a tuesday afternoon.
Something about seeing a couple with a big tv just makes me kind of sad for them.

        ‚ÄúThe real reason they are told to bash baseball is the game has not been Africanized. It is not a running and jumping sport. There are no opportunities for the blacks to draw attention to themselves with the usual antics.‚ÄùBaseball stopped being black in the 1990s, and even then the blacks were adhering to the white baseball player‚Äôs ethos of sportsmanship, stoicism, and humility. Usually.What killed my interest in baseball was the influx of Hispanics (and the overt marketing as well). Hispanics, unlike blacks, did not adopt the white ballplayer‚Äôs ethos. They turned it into a circus. Even the grumpy white managers started allowing the uniform flair and the V-Day celebrations.

            White men invented football, basketball, and baseball.  Black men said, ‚ÄúJust give us a chance and don‚Äôt discriminate when we need to be put up in hotels,‚Äù as you might learn by reading about Lombardi.  So Lombardi fought against discrimination, which most of us would have done in those days; the problem is that they are just too stupid to understand that there‚Äôs a difference between being allowed to play and prosper, and knowing how not to destroy that which made you a participant and wealthy.  Dumb, just dumb. And Vince would have bitch slapped Kappernick.It always starts out as ‚ÄúWe just want our fair share,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe just want to abort a baby when we‚Äôve been raped.‚Äù  And then it ends up being reversed.

        Orwell got a few things wrong and a whole hell of a lot right. ‚ÄúAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others‚Äù remains a perfect summation of the outlook of our oligarchic ruling class. ‚ÄúWar is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength‚Äù could easily serve as a slogan for today‚Äôs America. Finally, ideas such as newspeak, double think, and thought police are as relevant as ever in our thoroughly pozzed culture. Don‚Äôt underestimate Orwell ‚Äî in numerous ways, he was a sage. P.S.: Huxley too was quite prescient, arguably more so than Orwell. Both were visionaries.

            Most of Z‚Äôs elbows are thrown accurately and land hard.  But that jab at Orwell was just ornery foolishness.  What Orwell got right about language propaganda and conditioning makes what he got wrong (the wallpaper) beside the point.

        My few remaining elderly relatives who grew up in Mayberry will, when asked directly, say that way back, long before even the before times, there might have been a local bachelor or two who was viewed as ‚Äòfunny‚Äô ‚Äì but who were understood to be permanent members of the community nonetheless.
Now enfeebled and stuck in front of a screen for all their waking hours, these old folks will, when asked directly, guess the homosexual population at around 25%, and already seem to think that whites are a minority.

        I still watch, but only pre-recorded stuff, including football games.  The commercials are unbearable.
Reruns of The Office, especially the early seasons, are surprisingly good.  The show lampoons early 2000‚Äôs PC culture.  It even has a lazy black guy and a woman who is the target of fat jokes.  The most compelling story line is whether the young white salesman and young white female receptionist will ever get together.
Can you imagine how pozzed ‚ÄúOffice: The Reboot‚Äù would be?

        ‚ÄúThe products are things this demo is not buying.‚ÄùOf course. The purpose of such ads is NOT to sell to you, the purpose is to demoralize you, to make you feel isolated.I tend to listen (on-line) to baroque music while doing routine work, and was struck by how many commercials feature blaring rap or hip hop music (looking at YOU, Apple). My first thought was, ‚ÄúPeople listening to Bach are generally not the hip hop crowd. This is poorly targeted advertising.‚Äù Then I realized that they aren‚Äôt trying to sell me an Apple Watch, it‚Äôs just an in-your-face.Back in ye olden tymes you‚Äôd have some asshole with a boombox turned up to distortion levels, strutting around in a public place, just to intimidate whitey.

            Yep. But with the mouth Don has ‚Äì you know it had to happen eventually. I think the reason it blew over so fast was just as our blog host says ‚Äì people have become used to seeing Whitey humiliated or demonized by the Usual Suspects, and just accepted Don as yet another sacrifice to Diversity. We are next, let there be no doubt.I personally cannot boycott the mainstream any more than I already am. I went to getting my entertainment from Netflix (I can filter out most of the poz with it ‚Äì the second I see propaganda or morality plays I just go back to browsing) and YidTube. Although YT is now compromised too. Often I can‚Äôt skip the ads fast enough.The thing you have to keep in mind as dissidents ‚Äì is that this crap isn‚Äôt aimed at you. It‚Äôs aimed at your kids.

        Are you familiar, Z, with the story Dr E Michael Jones likes to tell of the conflict between the IDF and the Intifada? The IDF placed snipers on the rooftops, keeping everyone inside. They also took over the tv station and broadcasted hardcore pornography. This is one of the first documented cases of overt military use of television/pornography as a mind control weapon.

        It‚Äôs been said that, according to advertisers, the average American family is an hispanic father, a black mother, and 3 gay Asian children.

        Apropos Z Man‚Äôs comments about all the commercial breaks during football games, I had the same experience years ago, but in reverse. In the seventies my dad used to a set of NFL tickets about once a year through his office, and we could go. Then he retired.Sometime in the mid/late eighties, my brother and I got a set of tickets to a game, so we went. I was taken aback by all the standing around ‚Äî for minutes at at time ‚Äî during the game. Of course, it quickly became apparent that it was all for the commercial breaks. At that point it became comical. What was supposed to be this exercise in manly courage seemed more like a vehicle for next product advertisement. I started singing the jingles to familiar commercials during these breaks.I guess people get used to it, but it all seemed so bizarre. I took my son to two games in the aughts when he was a boy, but otherwise, that experience is not for me.

        We pulled the plug on TV more than 20 year ago, when our first child was born. I‚Äôve only watched it during college football season, and yes, what has struck me most are the incessant and ludicrous commercials; Cars or car insurance, Big Pharma ads, and of course, mixed or gay couples playing house. Corporate America assumes viewers of college football games either have one foot in a nursing home, or belong to the Psychosphere of Progressive Clown World. Talk about missing your target demographic! It‚Äôs about as effective as running anti-gun ads during a televised NASCAR event, or pitching Afro-sheen during championship bowling in Salt Lake City. Televised modern-day marketing appears clueless.

I used to think that also. Now I believe that it is deliberate. The purpose of these ads is NOT to sell to you. These ads are anin your faceto make you feel that you are isolated, out-of-touch, strange, and unwanted.

        I cut the cord more than 30 years ago when my first son was little. It made me a different person. I no longer had my head filled with the subliminal and overt brainwashing of the boob tube. I stopped being conditioned to cheer for the heroes they told me to cheer for. It took a bit longer to experience the same break with conservative internet media ‚Äî there were cracks even before Trump, but Trump blew the whole thing open. I realized more every day that the Shapiros and Goldbergs they sent to placate me were really my enemy. I don‚Äôt know if I would have realized it that readily if my head was still full of TV poz.I cheat a little. I did have occasional contact in hotel rooms on business, and I‚Äôll watch shows on Netflix or Amazon, but it has mostly been an ad-free experience for all that time. I don‚Äôt know how anyone can stand them. They drove me crazy in hotel rooms. And even that ‚Äî I haven‚Äôt watched a hotel room TV in probably 10 years or more.A few times I have found myself at the homes of working class people who have the TV on all. The. Time. Usually endless episodes of  home flipping shows on HGTV or something like that. They stare at it like zombies and it is hard to hold a conversation *shudder*.I saw a series I wanted to watch on Amazon Prime last week and the first season was free with ads. The ads were excruciating. Not only dumb, but actually creepy and disturbing.Of course, the low IQ target on the shows is something I just grit my teeth over. The plot developments would seem dumb to an 8-year-old, I think (well, a 60s 8-year-old). Nothing is really clever. Every show seems to move the plot forward by having characters stupidly withholding information on the flimsiest of excuses from other characters when it would obviously be important and helpful to have them  know. Don‚Äôt get me started (too late).

        Another thought, somewhat related, is the fact that TVs are no longer a passive device ‚Ä¶ they transmit.  The problem is compounded when we add phones, Alexa, and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù appliances and utility meters.  No sense in grumbling about governmental pervasiveness when we voluntarily welcome corporate snooping.  This is definitely trending down Huxley‚Äôs path.

        I used to be addicted to watching Fox News in the morning while I exercised.  Then I decided to cut the cord when Direct TV jacked the rates up again and I switched to podcasts.  Now when I happen to see Fox News I find myself involuntarily yelling at the TV.  It is so incredibly lame, with really lame talking heads all saying same stuff that is completely beside the point.  The advertisement for the fat, black, childless lady who apparently is able to consume her  home, clothes, art and job all courtesy of some sort of nonsense named AIDS drug is particularly bizarre.  The spell has certainly been broken for me.

            The great thing about cord-cutting and ignoring cable news in favor of podcasts is that your opinions get more conversational and nuanced as opposed to narrative-molded or poll-approved. (Everyone knows the Fox News Uncle who spews the most predictable ‚Äúmuh war on Christmas‚Äù nonsense.) I‚Äôve borrowed quips and BTFOs from the assortment of pods I listen to, and I‚Äôm able to thunderstrike a shitlib from time to time.

        ‚ÄúFor a long time, football and baseball were things most whites could share as a cultural item.‚ÄùAnd with non-Whites to a large degree.  I used to use muh sportsball as an ice-breaker and bridge with guys of all tribes ‚Äì and the occasional sports-gurl.The amount of brain-space, time &amp; energy I used to invest in sportsball is embarassing to recall, akin to drug addiction or alcoholism and now that I have some perspective, serving the same purpose.Flashback ‚Äì sports-bar Sat-Sun, 30-40-somethings wearing kids clothes &amp; shoes, an unbecoming look unless you‚Äôre full Am-Black ‚Äì even Jeets &amp; Pedros look ridiculous in this stuff.  Swilling the alcohol-equivalent of Purpa-Drank.  Basically white-ghetto weekend, then get up with a hangover on Monday &amp; do it again until MNF.  Repeat until dead.Comfortably numb works for awhile, but that voice inside that says ‚Äúmore than this..‚Äù gets loud enough to pierce the bafflegab more often as you get older.  Only the meaningful rage of awareness satisfies that hunger.Tune out, turn off, drop in ‚Äì to real life.  Yesterday is not soon enough.

My brother had to keep his wife happy, so they purchase Sling tv, over the air antennae with HD digital recorder and a few paid apps on Roku. They are just getting it in a different dose. From heroin to methadone.

        After I took my father home from an outpatient operation the other day (where I was forced to watch the impeachment proceedings on the monitors) we went to a T.G.I. Fridays to get him lunch, and there, on all the monitors, were the idiot commentators like Jason Whitlock and Steven A talking about nothing very loudly. I spent the next few hours wondering literally who was stupider and had less to say, the political class and political commentariat or sports commentators? They might as well have the impeachment proceedings on ‚ÄúThe View‚Äù and have the American public vote via 800 number on their cellphone whether or not Trump stays in office.

        I cancelled cable in 1999 and never regretted it.  My family did have cable TV outside of the United States, but there are some good programs on French TV and the commercials are not as frequent or as proselytizing for degeneracy.  Last year I watched some football and Jeopardy with my 90-year old father and found precisely the situation that Z-man describes.  I‚Äôm leaving the U.S. in January but I cannot imagine the circumstances under which I would get cable or satellite TV.

        Too many of us finance the enemy and/or giving them our head-space.  I cut the cord in the early 2000s.  I have a roof antenna, but almost never watch TV.  You are right that after being away from it for a little while, it seems repulsive when you have a weak moment and try to go back.  I would rather slit my wrist than cut a check to Comcast every month.  I used to work in their main headquarters in the 90s and even then it was loaded with degenerates and freaks.   I was placed there in their IT dept as an independent contractor. I had to work directly for a homosexual who talked endlessly about his homosexual conquests.The day Dear White People was announced, I cut my Netflix subscription. I only rarely watched reruns there anyway.The lack of decent entertainment is just one of many ways clownworld takes its toll.

        Great quote from Steve Sailer in his Taki‚Äôs column:
https://www.takimag.com/article/serotonin-a-love-letter-to-protectionism/
In Serotonin, old-fashioned trade protectionism serves as a metaphor for life and love, while the ideology of free trade represents depression and death. The purpose of property, whether private or national, is to shelter you from relentless competition.

            Mike,
Cut that cord.
My grandparents use to tell that, in Tennessee at least, Baptist preachers would preach that ‚Äúwhere you see the antenna of a TV you see the horns of the Devil‚Äù. (this was circa Korean War)
For a long time I thought that was just plain over the top ‚Äî but around 2001 I came to see TV is Evil. All of it.

        I see FB stories and memes about some random black person doing a good deed. Help someone across the street, or stop a theft or something. I see them all the time, and people randomly hit like so they are spread. Conservatives love these stories.Someone has to be mining for these unicorns on purpose. It‚Äôs designed to give a false impression of black Americans.The opposite tactic would be for stories and memes about blacks committing crimes against whites. While we should definitely do that it‚Äôs not as viral as a feel good story. Nice white ladies love these kinds of things. We should find a way to get them to spread news more favorable to our side.

My suggestion for something more viral is spreading pictures of picturesque white Europeans towns like this to remind people what kinds of places whites create.

        If you want to know how cucked Goodwhites are, look no further than the Rooney family and the Pittsburgh Steelers.They could not be any more flagrant in pushing poz and negrodolatry and the idiot yinzers in Pittsburgh still stuff money into their pockets which they then give to the people who hate white Steelers fans and what them dead.Even kneel-o-rama couldn‚Äôt break the conditioning.But what can you expect from a city that hasn‚Äôt elected a Republican mayor since 1933, and who re-elected (without opposition) Bill Peduto.

        I too find it difficult to watch football ‚Äì college or pro.  I have to have the remote in my hand and regularly switch to another game during the constant time outs.
I did watch a lot of World Cup rugby and now I‚Äôm watching the European League playoffs whenever they are on.  (I played back in my younger days)  Much more entertaining to watch since there are far fewer timeouts, the action only stops when the ball goes out of bounds or there is a penalty.  The players‚Äô uniforms are NASCAR-like advertising billboards, but fewer commercials.

        With the commoditization of video the upside is we can now record our cats or catch a communist AntiFa in the act of violence. The downside of it is broadcast programs have become a lot lower quality. Sports used to be more entertaining but squeezing in as many beer commercials and ATT homosexual happy married guys has ruined the experience, Z is right.Automation and TV News on every channel has also devalued news programming too.Now everything is Breaking News!!!If television wasn‚Äôt a wasteland 50 years ago it certainly is now.

        NBA ratings have collapsed, and were never that large to begin with.NFL tv ratings are supposedly stabilized, but who knows if the ratings are not lied about.   A shit-ton of empty seats in the stadiums though.Even with Tivo technology (record-and-skip) the games are unwatchable.  They actually stop games to let a commercial happen?!   None of this is sports any more, it‚Äôs WWE++I find it strange that suburban white guys still watch this crap though, with all the other entertainment options available.   I would watch old games from the 70‚Äôs before I would watch this rancid slop.I know I talking into the void when I recommend European soccer as a still very high quality sporting experience.  They genuinely let the players go at it for a full 45 minutes without ads.  The game can get into a rhythm, and the sight of huge green fields is Elyssian.Clay Travis at Outkick The coverage goes over the economics of cable tv packaging, and sports programming costs.   The bottom line is that once the cable/satellite companies go under, pro sports here will shrink back markedly.

                Me and some Sanchos were watching a bit of rugby in the breakroom.  The futbol channel had switched it up.
Repeated cries of ‚ÄúHoly sh*t‚Äù and ‚ÄúMira le! (Watch out!)‚Äù were forthcoming.  ‚ÄúDidya see that?!‚Äù
We were rather intimidated, I must say, by the defiantly undiversified players.  Big, tough white boys, they were- and they didn‚Äôt stop.

        The last time I was in the U.S. the hotel was playing a cable news channel in the breakfast room. It was too loud to ignore and very partisan in favour of the Democrats. In the 20 or so other countries I‚Äôve been to this decade I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen that before ‚Äì at least not with the volume turned up.  Apparently even restaurants now have that stuff on. This is disconcerting because everything bad about your country eventually spreads to the rest of the West.

And it‚Äôs just making a lot of noise.‚ÄùIn each case, I was told that ‚Äúit‚Äôs on CNN by corporate orders‚Äù. (Sometimes they said ‚Äúhead office‚Äù but you get the idea.) One woman in particular expanded her remarks with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I know it‚Äôs annoying. *I* have to listen to it every day because of this job, and it‚Äôs killing me!‚ÄùNow my sample size is small (N=6 or so) but it was very consistent.

        Word. How do we throw a life ring to our friends? I‚Äôve tried to point out the ridiculously retarded crap there watching and the fact that they used to be someone of disciplined character that wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead wasting time that can‚Äôt be recovered. It (TV) pulls their IQ down to sewer. TV is going to need a new market of rehab centers. Betty Ford clinic for TV addiction. One week with no screen will fix it, like Z said. You won‚Äôt go back.

            Get them outside ‚Äì far enough for no cell coverage.  Take a week-long group hiking, hunting or fishing trip.  Better yet, two weeks. Then give everyone a challenge ‚Äì keep the TV off for another two weeks.  No JewTube on the phone, no browsing for muh shows or muh sports.  Then get together and watch some TV with them after a month.It sounds too easy, but a week to a month off from the Truth Screen will help a lot of Possibles progress to being at least Prospects for Our Thing.  Like a cult, Big Other needs full-spectrum 24/7 coverage and isolation of the subject to keep the conditioning fresh.  Get them involved in a group of non-degenerates and get them away from the Screen and the Old Ways start to reassert themselves.

        Yes, television-based memetic reprogramming is pretty bad, and is disproportionately targeted at the few remaining robust males in our society, but by far the most insidious and destructive methodology of indoctrination is occurring via cell phone addiction. And it‚Äôs happening all over the planet, not just here in the USA. We are morphing into insect-like drones in real-time. As an example, the Harvard Yale football game was delayed by 48 minutes by hundreds of SJW climate change protesters.

        I had to hunt a bobcat taking our free range hens.  Every day hidden on the verge of the hen run, from 2:00 pm until as late as 8:30 (twilight in late summer).  As a consequence, I was away from any entertainment venues for that time, focused on the girls and waiting for my opportunity.After two months, I got the bastard.  I shot him in the act of dragging off one of our older, more productive hens.  But that is a different story altogether.I found, when I tried to return,  that the talking heads were insufferable.  We still watch a few shows. but not many.  Most of that is pre-recorded so we can skip the incessant commercials.

                haha i had a raccoon problem in a tony neighborhood (jewish i found out humorously after i bought in) in charleston sc.  Some old lady had been feeding them for years and they were huge, numerous and lacked any fear of humans. Back then i lacked the sophistication i now possess. I  was a sterotypical hillbilly. I shot one racoon in my carport but the law payed a visit and told  me to knock it off.  F‚Äôcking neighbor must have ratted me out.  Anyways, resorted to turning over a red wagon  with wooden sides and propping it up with stick in the carport.  I used cat food as bait and ran a string tied to the stick to a window. Caught one the first night but hadn‚Äôt really thought it out beyond that.  It was big and bucking the wagon around‚Ä¶  and i guess i panicked a bit. Anyways i grabbed a baseball bat and beat it to death.  Over the course of a summer i trapped 8 coons out of my carport, i shit you not.  Started to smell metallic, like an abattoir. My elderly jewish neighbors started treating me with a strange new respect, but to their credit they didn‚Äôt rat me out again. Ahem, that was back in my drinking days.

                I have a trap.  It is considerably more difficult to trap a bobcat in a rural setting than it would appear.  I lost 25 hens to this animal over just over two years.  My neighbor, about a half-mile from the house told us they had lost 83 hens over a similar period.I have been a hunter and/or protector for almost 50 of my 64 years.  I will say that this was the single most satisfying shot I have ever taken in my life.  At least two pellets (#4 buck) entered the animal‚Äôs brain pan and it was an almost immediate death.  Keeled over, two kicks, immobility.I came to love the afternoon and transition to evening.  I am surrounded by forested hills and listening to the animals go to roost and wind down for the day came to be more satisfying than I ever would have imagined.  In the three months since I made the shot, the girls have been molested once by a stray dog.  I ‚Äúdid the needful‚Äù and that particular animal will not bother my hens again. I don‚Äôt get the mentality of some dog owners that leaving their unwanted animals in my valley is wise.

        That‚Äôs why television watching will eventually be mandatory. Orwell got most things wrong about the dystopian future. The one thing he nailed was the video monitors installed in every home. It may not be as heavy handed as he described, but there is no way the usual suspects allow the public to cut the cord. Without the daily dose of poz, there is no way white people go along with their dispossession. The revolution comes when the televisions go dark for any length of time.They even have these tv monitors installed at all the gas pumps now. Constantly trying to push the poz in your face at every opportunity. I just look away.

        No TV for the kids, except on Saturday. They have become more creative, found ways to entertain themselves and use their imagination, and seem more relaxed and focused on school. I may watch a few episodes or a movie on Netflix or Hulu during the week, but I like to pursue other activities. People don‚Äôt realize how much time they waste when they engage their brain with a screen.

        The only challenge I have with reading this site is it is like if I read the things I write down out loud, but better written/thought out. I can kind of skip ahead without missing any thing.

        See movies for free: most public libraries have considerable holdings of DVD/Blu-ray films. Costs you merely what you‚Äôve already paid in taxes. Go to your library‚Äôs online catalogue, request movies on disc, your library sends you an e-mail when the disc arrives at your local branch. In many instances you can renew the borrowing period on the library website.My city‚Äôs public library now has video/movie streaming via Hoopla, but to see films that way you must register with a corporate tentacle of Google, so I have not registered.As far as television fare goes, to me there is one shining moment above all others, and that is the late-1970‚Äôs production ofBrideshead Revisited, starring Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews, Claire Bloom. I have the series on DVD and each long dark winter I enjoy watching again all thirteen of its episodes. The series is far and away the most intelligent, the most civilized bit of television ever done.

        Can somebody theorize the line of thinking behind tptb pushing to destroy white male sports fandom and demoralize them through commercials?If I were in charge, and I wanted to slowly dispossess whites, I would make them MORE into sportsball. Give them a real feeling of ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù amongst their tribe (sportsfan) members. Argue passionately over the players. Keep them distracted until it‚Äôs too late.What I hope is that, now that white males can no longer enjoy sports, they will start to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù‚Ä¶ but maybe (((they))) have psychological data that shows the contrary‚Ä¶ who knows. I‚Äôve been pretty disappointed in white people lately, to be honest.

        I love when you post about sports and TV commercials, which I have decided are comic gold for mockery rather than anger. I watch CF but no NFL but if it continues to trend as NFL-lite than I will give it up too. Not sure Orwell was incorrect on future dystopia, He did foresee PC and the manipulation of thought through control of language. He also foresaw humiliating people through the power to get them to confess to things they know are wrong.

        I pulled the plug about twenty five years ago.  Surprisingly, my wife went along with it.  We did come to a compromise, though.  I bought her a satellite radio so she can listen to FOX News.  We do have a flat screen TV but no subscriptions.  It‚Äôs hooked up to a Blue Ray player so I can see John Wayne once in a while.

        You‚Äôve listed all the reasons, i cut the cord and stopped watching. However, when I did follow a game, I either listened on the radio or taped the game and watched it later. The padding in a 2.5 hour football game is incredible. 50 minutes of commercials, 50 minutes of action, and 50 minutes of half-time and announcer blather.i agree the destruction of college football goes way back and deliberate. The liberals have always hated it, and almost every College president would be happy if the stadium and team disappeared. The constant cries about ‚ÄúUnpaid athletes‚Äô  is a backdoor way to destroy it. As is ‚ÄúHow about that black QB‚Äù?‚Äù .  Evidently, if 90% of CB and RB‚Äôs are black that‚Äôs OK, but if 65% of QB‚Äôs are white, well we have to do something about that.  The black QB‚Äôs are an ‚Äúoppressed minority‚Äù.

            If the last football game you watched took 2.5 hours, it must have been in 1974?!  They are 4+ hours long now, with pre-game etc.  And there is only about 10 minutes of actual playing time.

Well, in California they went off for me, and a few million others, for about three days a month ago. Now, -I- got mad at the Governor who appointed the CPUC which authorized that unnecessary and pointless return to a 19th Century that hardly anyone was prepared for, but most everyone else blames PG&amp;E, which isn‚Äôt driving the bus. No revolution seems to have been contemplated by the sheeple.

        Zman ‚Äì I continue to be amazed at how much alike our thinking is. I completed the move to Tennessee and what an incredible change. We have been there for 4 days, gone to 2 big neighborhood dinners, and I have already been invited to join the TN 3%. Finding a like minded man just requires looking out the window or going to the local store. What an incredible difference. The people are so friendly it is still making me suspicious. Everyone has guns, including all the 60+ year old neighbor ladies. I will keep reporting. On this move we cut the cord with just internet connectivity. No broadcast tv but I will join the big 10 network so I can watch my Penn State football, Maryland and Hopkins lacrosse, and wrestling.

        It only occurred to me a few weeks ago that I don‚Äôt watch television at all any more apart from Premier League football*. And I am watching less of that than I used to. No commercials during the game, only during the half-time break, so that‚Äôs something.
Otherwise, I don‚Äôt watch TV at all. I do have a Netflix account and you can find some excellent shows that are refreshingly unpozzed.

Blaming oneself and shelving the use of violent force as an option is to lose before you even begin to struggle.We were betrayed by our own elite and targeted by an alien one.  Whatever our own faults and shortcomings (of which there are plenty) these were ruthlessly exploited by the parents and grandparents of the people now filling our screens with sodomites and mulattas.Acts of entirely senseless violence are counterproductive.  And any other kind must for the time being be condemned.  But this will change, and when it does, we have to be at least mentally if not physically prepared for it, depending on one‚Äôs circumstances.

        [‚Ä¶] At some point, I decided to watch until I saw an ad featuring anything resembling normal people doing normal things. I gave up after about thirty minutes. If a space alien tried to understand America based on television, its conclusion would be that we are ruled by frizzy-haired mulatto lesbians and homosexuals. Their main task is keeping the simple-minded, almost retarded, white males under control. The TV ad world is the complete opposite of reality and any possible reality. [‚Ä¶]

I sometimes we on the right do not talk to people outside of our bubble. I have an effort to and most non-whites ARE exasperated with the entitlement and poor behavior of white males. They DO feel like they have to spend an inordinate amount of time corralling and policing our worse instincts. To completely discount there truth is dishonest and no better than liberals shutting us down.

                        Some So Cal gun ranges are like a John Ford Apache movie.  Mexicans can be such fools at the gun range that they had to shut it down for a while and lay down the rules.  White guys are up there acting sensibly and thinking as they shoot.  Some of the Mexicans are careless and downright dangerous.  That report was given to my by LAPD personnel.

                    What‚Äôs the problem with gun acquisition ‚Äì when the vast majority of guns acquired by whites never kill anybody?The problem is acquisition of guns by blacks.  Because those guns seem to inevitably end up being used in a murder.It‚Äôs like that video on jewtube where somebody hands an AK to chimpanzee ‚Äì you know something bad is going to happen.It‚Äôs also historical fact that gun control in this country has largely been driven by the urge to keep guns out of the hands of blacks (because they keep doing bad things with them).Any truly historically informed gun owner I‚Äôve ever talked to in the US, understands these facts.The truth of the matter is that gun owners in this country would have been far better off if Lincoln had done what he said he was going to do ‚Äì and had sent all the slaves back to where they came from.Because then they couldn‚Äôt have been used as a political cudgel to constantly beat whites about the head for shit they didn‚Äôt do.Plus our murder rate would be so much lower.

You gotta understand the blacks haven‚Äôt had access to proper society (i.e., no parenting) and are economically under privileged (i.e. prefer tax-payer-funded welfare to working) and don‚Äôt have access to the same kind of socio-educational advantages that whites have (i.e., prefer smoking blunts, skipping school, drug dealing, dancing, robbing, having sex with multiple partners over learning, developing and bettering themselves to be productive citizens).

Undoubtedly one of the reasons that he was assassinated. That and his opposition to the draconian Reconstruction plans to disenfranchise Southern whites and destroy them economically (among others, I‚Äôm sure, but those I‚Äôm familiar with).
Don‚Äôt get me wrong here, I‚Äôm not a fan of the man, but he had some very good views also, and that was not to be allowed.

            And exactly what ‚Äúworse instincts‚Äù are those that need corralling and policing?Last time I checked there isn‚Äôt a SINGLE city in this entire country that has an astronomical murder rate ‚Äì courtesy of white males.It‚Äôs not the white males that are smacking people in the head with a loose helmet during football games.It‚Äôs not white males that are dreaming up pathetic racial attacks in the dead of winter ‚Äì and would just sit back if somebody actually got (falsely) accused by the police for said attack.If you‚Äôre going to make the accusation ‚Äì back it up.I think it also bears pointing out that this country was built by white males ‚Äì  the POC are INTERLOPERS.  If they didn‚Äôt like the way we were running the place ‚Äì why the hell did they come here ?I can tell you that there‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôm moving myself or my family to the Congo.  I don‚Äôt like the way they run the place.  And I‚Äôm pretty sure that if I did actually go there ‚Äì and started mouthing off about the black males are running the place ‚Äì you‚Äôd find my body parts being sold in a roadside stand as bushmeat.Who here is REALLY living in the bubble?

                Taking each in turn, i will try to respond as a progressive:1. the murder rate is a flawed statistic but assuming it is true it is caused by systemic abuse done to non-white. You guys need to see Watchmen on HBO, as it explains how white racists use movies to tell Blacks to kill other Blacks2. Mason Rudolph attacked Myles Garrett3. read white fragility by Diangelo. Most interracial attacks are done by whites to non-whites. Look at Charlottesville4. The country was built by Black slave labor and stolen from Indigenous Peoples5. You DO live in bubble. DO you know that whites committed colonailsm, genocide, and slavery. Even if you don‚Äôt, non-whites do and are committed to righting past wrongs

                    The murder rate is not a flawed statistic.  Everybody knows that the majority of murders in this country are black on black ‚Äì and it happens in black run cities.  Everybody  knows this ‚Äì even the blacks.  Every now and then even some of the blacks admit to it ‚Äì and then they‚Äôre browbeaten by the ‚Äúwhitey made me do it‚Äù crowd into shutting the hell up.If the white racists are telling blacks to kill blacks ‚Äì then they really need to up their game.  Because they don‚Äôt seem to be making a dent. If blacks are so easy to manipulate ‚Äì how come we can‚Äôt get them off welfare and supporting their own asses?I‚Äôll believe  you that whites are manipulating blacks into murdering each other ‚Äì when there‚Äôs a few extra zeros added to the end of the number.The assertion that most interracial attacks are white on black is another bit of comedy.  This stuff has been documented extensively ‚Äì and blacks are responsible for the vast majority of interracial crime.  If they‚Äôre not attacking whites, they‚Äôre attacking other POC like Asians and Hispanics.What exactly did black slaves build in this country?  Please be specific.  What ‚Äì maybe a few buildings and some roads here and there?  That‚Äôs not the whole country.  Black slaves were largely used as agricultural implements. And just because some slave picked the cotton used to make a pair of coveralls back in 1850 ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt mean the rest of use have to keep paying for that pair of coveralls.  The slave is dead ‚Äì and the clothing has long since been buried and rotted away in the ground ‚Äì after it served it‚Äôs useful life of 5 years or so.The whole ‚Äúbuilt the country‚Äù claim is probably the most comical claim that the blacks have in this country.  So your great great great grandfather chopped some trees and built a road?  IT DOESN‚ÄôT MATTER.  As a practical point in the current day ‚Äì he didn‚Äôt build a damn thing .  The road has either been regraded and repaved by dozens if not hundreds of men in the succeeding years (most likely white men) ‚Äì or it‚Äôs been reclaimed by nature and simply doesn‚Äôt exist any more.I live in New England.  Blacks didn‚Äôt build jack shit up here.  It was all built by white men.If blacks built America ‚Äì how come Detroit and Baltimore are such falling down shitholes?  Seems like the evidence is against you.Maybe blacks can only build things when there‚Äôs a white man around to show them what to do?I don‚Äôt see any pyramids here in North America.  Which are one of the few man made things on the face of the planet that lasted thru the centuries.   Most human labor has a definite shelf life.  Your cotton picking ancestor‚Äôs labor was expended on clothes that are long since rotted away. Their labor is GONE.  Their progeny deserve NOTHING.  Your other ancestor‚Äôs labor MIGHT HAVE BEEN expended building some roads ‚Äì the roads are either washed away , consumed by mother nature ‚Äì or have been built and rebuilt so many times over the years the original labor that built them is just a footnote in the lifespan of that road.White people took slaves because they didn‚Äôt want to spend their lives stooped over in a field picking cotton. Your ancestors who ended up here were the stupid and slow ones who got caught and shipped over.I encourage your obvious ignorance of real history ‚Äì as well as your bad arguments however.  It makes my job of convincing my fellow whites to stop cucking themselves and apologizing for shit they didn‚Äôt do so much easier .

Watchmen is HUGELY popular. ONly Game of Thrones beats it.
As far as crime goes: please read Nikole Hannah Jones. She explains how segregation and white racism pretty much forces People of Colour to use extra-legal means and violence to seek redress in a brutal white suprmacist power structure.

                            Black man defending himself in court for shooting up a neighborhood house full of children (black children) ‚Äì and killing two of them:‚Äù I was seeking redress against the white power structure!!‚Äù.Black jurors agree and let him off.Next week he shoots up the neighborhood again ‚Äì and kills a sister of one of the jurors.‚Äù I was seeking redress against the white power structure!!‚Äù.Black jurors again let him off ‚Äì because whitey.One month later he murders the mother of one of his illegitimate kids (that he never supports).‚Äù I was seeking redress against the white power structure!!‚ÄùThis time there‚Äôs a jury pool with some white people on it ‚Äì and he goes to jail.The black neighborhood riots ‚Äì because the white power structure has been oppressin‚Äô the black man and sent him to jail unjustly.  Half the neighborhood burns ‚Äì including the Safeway.Safeway wisely decides to (finally) give up because rebuilding the store just isn‚Äôt cost effective ‚Äì especially given the massive overhead they previously had due to theft and security costs.Neighborhood riots again because now the white power structure (Safeway) is trying to starve them out.Meanwhile the remaining whites located anywhere near this neighborhood are quickly making plans to bug out to the suburbs.  Once they‚Äôre gone ‚Äì blacks start filling the political positions in the city.Ah yes ‚Äì I understand now.It‚Äôs the white power structure that caused all of this.LOL.

                                Well, at least the unjustly oppressed Halloween Airbnb Five were released, since the Contra Costa DA refused to press charges.
Remember, those black guys who shot up a black Airbnb party?  A classic case of inherited slavery PTSD.

                    1.  Soon, blacks will kill only white men thanks to Soros and the Left with their preoccupation with judges and prosecutors.  Do you want that?  If you can‚Äôt focus on history and how politics causes effects, then you have not thought it through.4.  I think you would get a lot of blowback from Italians and Irish on that statement.5.  African colonialism?  They didn‚Äôt know what the wheel was used for until whites came to Africa.  And blacks have committed genocide on their own race in Africa and captured their own to sell them into slavery.
