        Huh. Thankfully I have managed to avoid much interaction with the medical profession. While modern medicine can and does save a lot of lives (although “medical mistakes” remain one of the leading causes of death) in my limited experience medicine is a massive racket and a grift.I hit a deer on a motorcycle about a year and-a-half ago. Three broken ribs, fractured clavicle, collapsed lung. I was picked up off the street by volunteer firemen. The female ER doctor in the local hospital either couldn’t or wouldn’t insert a tube to reinflate the lung, so they transferred me to a hospital 30 miles away. $5200 for a one-way ambulance ride during which I got (and needed) zero actual treatment. The driver was probably making $25 an hour. Should have taken an Uber. When I got there they gave me a 10-minute CAT scan. $12,000.They then inserted the tube, which took less than 10 minutes. It was in for 24 hours, held by one stitch. For the broken ribs and clavicle I got zero treatment, just left to heal on their own.48 hours in the hospital and they billed the insurance company fifty grand. I got the distinct impression that the entire system was a ripoff from start to finish. “Laying on the pavement injured, boy? We’ll take care of ya… heh, heh. But it’ll cost ya.”Yes, the pneumothorax was potentially serious and they treated that with efficiency and dispatch, but Jeezus… $50,000?

                He actually did ride it down the pavement for a bit. Jumped into my shoulder and sent met flying, then fell onto the bike. The deer and the bike slid down the road sideways for a bit until he got up and ran into a truck.

        I think you’re being overly skeptical of Kennedy – he looks like the real deal to me.  Any kind of significant house cleaning of the governmental “health” agencies is sorely needed and sorely welcome. A prosecution of fauci, among others, would be icing on the cake.

        I wonder if the relative efficacy of surgeons is part of the reason they were considered second-class by British doctors, being called “Mr.” instead of “Dr.”
Feel better soon!

            No. The reason that surgeons are called “Mr” instead of “Doctor” is connected with a kind of reversed social snobbery that could only occur in Britain.

                Right, surgeons had to get their hands dirty and doctors didn’t. I was wondering if perhaps deep down the doctors knew the surgeons were better than them, and that fed the resentment and snobbery.
(There’s something similar with British lawyers, by the way.)

                It’s amazing watching the wire 20 years later. In the very first episode McNulty meets with his fbi friend who tells him they are dropping drug cases for counter terrorism: “what, you don’t have love in your heart for two wars?”
