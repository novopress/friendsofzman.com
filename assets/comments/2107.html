        LBJ is trying to catch up with Kobe Bryant (5 NBA championships) and Michael Jordan (6 rings), but he’ll never catch up with Bill Russell (11 championships). LBJ is a terrific physical specimen and a pleasure to watch in an era when the written rules of the game are no longer enforced. It isn’t your classic BB anymore, not after MJ ruined it.
