        Red pills in my opinion, can’t really be proselytized.  The have to come naturally to people, like the morning dew.  They have to come from similar experiences.  Mine came one evening on the Green Line in DC, like out of the movie Death Wish.  I started out the evening like the beginning of the movie.  Liberal Democrat architect Charles Bronson in his cardigan.  I ended the evening like post home invasion Charles Bronson in leather jacket.

            Death Wish had two pivotal points:  1) death of wife and rape of daughter; 2) gift of gun from developer in Tucson, AZ.  Without either of these, Bronson would have died a clueless, miserable normie.We obviously can’t and wouldn’t wish the loss of a family on anyone, but we can share such stories of the “little murders” in the daily lives of ourselves and others.Point #1 can be made to varying extent with most people.  Life is not getting better, it’s getting worse—at least in those areas that are fundamentally important.  Point those out.  I bet you’ll find a favorable audience.  Folks fundamentally “know” something is not quite right, but just can’t lay their finger on it or put it into words.  Some may even fear to say what they “know”.  Be their sounding board.Point #2 need not be a gun and a call to violence, rather a call to knowledge.  Albeit, increasingly such sources are under attack, they are not all eliminated.  The basics of the movement are underwritten in science and that information continues to grow and is stored in most institutional libraries and squirreled away in a hundred pockets on the internet waiting to be downloaded.The scientific literature is often oblique wrt the ultimate meaning of these data, but that is your job to elaborate upon.  There are not enough Winston Smiths or “memory holes” in the world to remove and disappear these truths.

                    You chose your own moral stance. I refuse to visit the sins of the fathers on the children.  Now if the children are guilty of misbehavior or benefit from the parents immorality, then we take it from there as to what is justice.

            I agree. My red pill came in high school in 1983 when I experienced my first race riot  and later being threatened with a beat down by a black thug. I learned that blacks are not like whites at all and they hate us, really hate us.  Since then it’s been a series of edifying experiences that just baked it in.Without being exposed to the terror of watching a race riot unfold before me in High school and the staff doing  but letting it happen was a eye opener.Then later came the Rodney King riots. Watching LA burn on TV and seeing a white truck driver being pulled from his can by rage apes and then crushing his head with a cinder block. Then noticing all the police in town had vanished while car loads of skin headed Mexicans started showing up. Having to sleep with weapons within arms reach.If I just read about these events they would have meant noting to me  It was only by experiencing did I understand what a precarious position whites are in.

            There’s probably something to this. Watching conservatives make the same losing arguments for 30 straight years has an effect. Pointing out Democrats ran the Jim Crow south sounds like a zinger the first time. The thousandth time it sounds like pandering and looks pathetic.

I think you re right. But there might be a social tipping point there, a ‘critical mass’, after which it is sufficiently w/i Overton for ppl to even consider it. And realize that it makes sense.

        Good post.  Some advice to folks on border issues:Be vague.  Pretend to be a Normie tourist. Have a tourist spiel to unveil. Given the US has 30 to 50 Million illegal aliens (&amp; most countries in the Anglosphere are equally deep into Anarcho-Tyranny), the customs &amp; immigration folks are not that bright.  They have Anti-White GloboBozo marching orders from Senior management, but again, they are not geniuses.If folks coming to the US want to attend AmRen, they best fly to another state, then connect to Nashville using a separate ticket. Improvise and adapt.

            Surely Nashville gets enough visitors that you wouldn’t attract suspicion merely from flying into the city from abroad?
I do think it would be foolish of anyone to tell the truth about attending an event like this. There are a million and one other reasons for entering the country.

                The key moment is when you are asked the purpose of your trip by US Customs. Say you are visiting friends, going to Disney, going on a bus tour, going to visit sites X, Y &amp; Z.  What you ultimately do is up to you, and assuming that freedoms of speech, assembly &amp; association can still be asserted, you’ll be fine. Anarcho-Tyranny proceeds because bureaucrats use their discretionary powers (left wing bias) to deem someone a ThoughtCriminal.  Don’t give them any basis at all for using those discretionary powers.

        Ol Sid attended this year.  Got to meet Z.  Have always suspected that he had a face made for radio but was surprised to find he is a statuesque blond.  Almost too pretty to be a man:).   As part of my profession I go to many conferences.  Will relate that this was far, and away, one of the most interesting.  Found some of the speakers a bit disappointing.  Derbyshire mailed it in. The French guy was largely unintelligible and his slides would have greatly benefited from just a very few clear english labels. Will recommend that if you attend; take up smoking for 2 days. I met some ridiculously interesting characters (e.g.  a russian count and the guy that wrote the morganthau plan). Also met a sweet newly married couple.  Not sure amren is the best honeymoon but can strongly recommend  one attend otherwise. It was fun.

        “Everyone has a role to play, but the most important role is for everyone in dissident politics to get creative on red-pilling their friends and family.”Btw, I visited a friend over the weekend. We go back some years now, to college, I met him right after I moved from the US to Denmark. We share a lot of interests and politics were never an issue. But he’s totally a cultural marxist narrative guy. ‘Racist’ is the worst sin open, and ‘racistly’ enough a sin only open to whites, go figure…. Holy smoke politics is starting to get in the way of even old friendships. This guy’s a militant atheist and he can take mild mocking that ‘Atheism is not a religion’ is their version of ‘there is no god but allah and Ol Mo was his prophet’. But get into race realism of even the mildest kind and suddenly ‘your character needs reassessment’. Normies are subconsciously conditioned to be scared sh*tless to even be in the same room as people who contradict the postmodern church’s ‘befehl’ that ‘racism is the worst sin an evil white can commit’. They’re totally cowed on this and it takes a sledgehammer to my respect for them.As a pick up artist would say in a different context, when red-pilling people, test your target slowly and carefully and discard the ones where you get no vibe to work with.

        Just when you think you’ve bookmarked or subscribed to all the best guys on our side, you’re told of yet another guy.  I’ve never heard of Allsup until Z’s post.  He’s got nearly half a million YouTube subscribers yet somehow I never came across him.   It doesn’t help that YouTube doesn’t populate my home page with guys their algo surely indicates that I’d like.I don’t think Z’s mentioned Nick Fuentes once without getting in a slight jab.  I don’t care.  It’s funny to me.  Just saying.  Those two must have had something of a barbed conversation back at AmRen ’18.The guy who got deported because he said he’s going to AmRen may as well have told the immigration officers he was coming to spread malaria.   Sounds like he wanted to spend the weekend fishing so he decided to tell the truth.

            Allsup used to be Nick Fuentes’ podcast partner. They had a pretty good show, but eventually broke up and then feuded for a few weeks, although I believe they’re now friendly again. There’s an interesting video out there of Allsup, Fuentes and a few other guys leaving Charlottesville walking alongside the highway being interviewed by Millie Weaver of InfoWars. Allsup does an effective job redpilling Weaver (and the InfoWars audience).

        I’m tired of the harping on generation politics too, but I will say that initially it was hard not to have an uncanny reaction (don’t think “unheimlich” can really translate from German to English) to that Soph girl or someone who’s 15 or so and that articulate. I think we’re so used to seeing stupid/insane adults in media and politics that an above-average/precocious talent looks like the fruits of some kind of sci-fi super-baby experiment. But I saw her on Ramzpaul, too, and it’s obvious she’s not reading from a script. It’s sad that an “adult” “journalist” like Joseph Bernstein is frightened of a fourteen year-old girl. A “man” trying to beat up a child is bad optics. The Covington Catholic fallout, the manufactured outrage at those boys, probably gave us 500,000 member boost in our red-pilled ranks in a 24-hour period.

            The Covington thing might become a good model for the future. Basically the boys were confronted with this oddball who likes to go around stirring up trouble while pretending to be a Native American. He’s a lefty but more importantly, he’s a weirdo with lots of strange ideas who does lots of unpredictable stuff. This is a serious problem on the Left. They often seem monolithic and at the top levels they have fairly good discipline. The problem is that poz basically glorifies deviance of all types and that means it attracts deviants of all types. The rank and file lefties are pretty disturbing to watch. I live near Portland, OR. Thankfully I’m pretty far away from it. Whenever I need to take the train into town I marvel at the “carny act” quality of the people. Portland attracts and concentrates these people from all over the country. Disproportionate numbers of them are mentally ill and they pretty much all seem to be heavy drinkers and drug users. They are more than half female and crazy in all the stereotypical wymmyn ways. This means that the Left’s own goon squads are always an “optics” disaster waiting to happen. We need to give them as many opportunities to do that as possible – and keep filming the whole time of course 😉

        Two comments:“The trouble, young guys will buck and not want to take direction from the home office”In my experience of teaching, it is not the young guys but the middle age, mid level beta guys who are the ones most resistant to instruction. Middle age, not so young anymore, midlevel means they have a mediocre ‘status’ or ‘position’ to ‘defend’ and ‘beta’ is their root problem, they are fundamentally weak and insecure which means that taking instructions threatens their sense of ‘worthiness’ for the ‘status’ they have worked so hard to acquire. ‘Alpha guys’, in science, medicine or martial arts, will often give you 5 minutes and see if you hook them w non-trivial, good sense. The mid level beta guy has already interrupted you 4-5 times by then, at least, and will fracture and get girlie angry when you tell him to be quiet. Young guys I often find easy to handle. Mid level beta guys, I cant deal w them.“John Derbyshire, who gave a talk on his idea of an arctic alliance.”I simply think he gets that fundamentally wrong. He wants to hook up w the Chinese against Africans, Arabs and, maybe, Indians, keeping ‘the sun people’ in the sun places. I think you need to swap Indians for Chinese there and the reason is that Indians, Im talking about the Hindus, not the muslims, have a mindset quite similar to Mediterranean Europeans whereas Chinese are ‘Asiatic autistic’ to Caucasian emotional structure. During colonial times Brits and upper caste, especially princely, Indians, worked very smoothly together. Problems arose when the Brits first trained a new ‘upper class’ of Indians, at Oxford and Cambridge, and trained them so well that they wanted to be accepted as the natural partners of the Brits. When the Brits chose the princes over the new Indian lawyers, and especially when one white South African train conductor refused to recognize one lawyer named Gandhi as ‘equal subject of the Crown’, that’s when trouble happened. I even think there’s a strong element of HBD in Derbyshire’s ‘vision’. The Indians are South Caucasians, Europeans (whites) are North Caucasians. Basically different ethnicities of the same race, Indians are just one step beyond Greeks away from us. The Chinese are a whole different race, Mongoloids. You see it in something like humor, it is very pronounced there. And you see it less in American (dot) Indians. It is in Indian Indians, not polluted by ‘you live as oppressed in a white racist society and they owe you’ neomarxist hate speech. Im not saying the US needs more Indian immigrants. I m saying that the Chinese are going to be dangeous rivals we will find it hard to understand, and Indians the only real non-Western ally worth having b/c they are (also) big. There is also the not irrelevant fact that 90% of Indian Hindus love whites and most Chinese definitely do not. And it is very obvious to hypothesize that the psychological similarities between white and Indians, compared to either vs Chinese (or other East Asians) is exactly biological. When Derbyshire denies that this matters, he is denying HBD.

            Moran, interesting comment and analysis.  What I immediately thought of however was Reich’s recent book, “Who We Are and How We Got Here: …”.   Reich has a chapter or so on India.  The findings he discusses helped to explain some of the incongruities I experienced wrt India and the students I encountered in the USA and the fairly low average IQ’s tested for India in general.  The basic conclusion as I interpreted his writing was that India may be best understood as a country of *many* races or sub races, structuring along the established cast system.  I believe about 5 main groups.That being said, can we divide/describe India as a whole into South Caucasian as you said and assume India as a whole has some natural affinity for us “North Caucasian’s”.  But regardless, I agree that the Chinese mindset is vastly different and not amenable to Western values.

                I believe it is true that India is a giant ancient ‘salad bowl’ of myriad small ethnicities that, b/c of the caste system, did not blend genetically much. And there certainly is a general low IQ issue here that could become a huge problem. But among the Brahmin (priest caste) and maybe a few others, they have pockets of people that seem to be the equivalent of Ashkenazi Jews, ie super bright.And you have to be in India to really realize that this is the one place that actually has ‘white privilege’; Indians like whites and buy tons of bleaching cream to be as light in skin tone themselves.But what Ive personally noticed, w Indians in both the US and India, is that we often have similar humor and instictively ‘frame’ issues and topics in the same way. This is just not the case w East Asians or Africans. They seem to be qualitively different in ‘mode of thinking’ in my experience. Whereas Indians remind me of Mediterranean Europeans, ie slightly more emotional than north-of-Alp-origin ppl. But a lot closer than Mongoloids or Negroids. Those are truely different races. I think both us and Brahmins are Caucasians. And that may really matter, instinctively, not for ‘theoretical, ideological’ reasons. But I hardly have a ‘final vision’ here, Im just thinking out loud.

It’s 20th C. thinking. The best thing you can do is to redpill people online, like you do with this blog.

        I was the old bald guy across the banquet table from you. I agree about John Morgan’s speech. Indeed, I thought his talk was the best of the conference. Very well designed: interesting, informative, with just enough wide-ranging history to provide essential context without getting lost in minute details. In fact, it was a tour de force, synthesizing history, ethnography, sociology, &amp; politics into a cogent analysis which made Hungary’s experience with Third World invasion (old &amp; new), and with multiculturalism over the centuries, relevant to the American experience today.

        The “arctic alliance” stuff is fake and gay. Derbyshire has an Asian wife and happa children. Does anyone seriously buy that whites, Asians and Jews are going to form some kind of justice league to fight the orcs?I’m always impressed by Derbyshire’s willingness to virtue signal despite the fact that he’s already been completely unpersoned by the mainstream. I heard him talking about the James Fields case on some podcast with Richard Spencer, and he had to preface his take by saying Fields is a piece of shit who he wanted nothing to do with. I mean, who is he saying that for?

                I don’t care what his opinion on James Fields is. The fact that he feels the need to bury the guy as a preface to his comments on his show trial is virtue signaling into the wind. There’s no other reason to even discuss Fields personally.

            Most of them look like they got in a fight with a vampire and lost. All very sickly looking, I’ve only seen that look with serious drug addicts. My guess would be Heroin.But when you look at the Left you can’t help but notice that there is very much a uniformity in looks or physiology among Leftiy males all the way from Google and twitter execs to your decrepit Antifa goon and HuffPost writer. In short they are all physical wrecks. What is even more surprising is how young many of them are.This physical desolation is just so odd if I had a superstitious bent I could swear that evil is eating away at them.

                🙂     It’s the lifestyle.  You see this all the time on campus and the immediate environs.  Birds of a feather type of thing.  Drugs, sex, communal low life living.  Alternative lifestyle.  Looks follow.  These folk are the “hippies” of the current era.

                        Sorry for the geekout , but Gollum was once a Hobbit.  In Middle Earth Men and Hobbits are different races.

        What mechanism do you use to get your ideas into words on a page?
You have many minor, not always easily sourcible typos.

        “Greg Johnson’s Canadian video guy was detained by U.S. customs at the airport and then deported, because he was coming to AmRen.”I wonder if you or someone else with knowledge of this could clarify what happened — normally a Canadian does not need a visa to enter the US — perhaps visit is better than enter here — meaning as a tourist — working in the US is a different matter — likely something about him triggered further scrutiny — that something could be equipment he was carrying (?), which resulted in suspicion that he was coming to the US in order to work, ie not to visit — this is a different matter, and is, like it or not, reason for someone arriving via the visa waiver program to be turned back — if it’s true he was then barred from entry for a further five years, then that is definitely outrageous.So there is a ‘non-AmRen’ explanation for why he was refused entry — again, any further details/info re what happened would be helpful.
