        Most people who are unfamiliar with ‘NawLins’ are shocked if they get out of the French Quarter; basically it resembles a third world country. When Katrina nailed Louisiana and they decided to accomidate refugees in Texas the culture shock was massive on both sides. In particular, persons who broke the law were shocked that, once arrested, they weren’t immediately released like back home. Those that wanted jobs generally found them, and for several years the State of Louisiana had billboards in Houston and other towns to tell them “Come Home”.

        In Germany, where I lived for 4 years, the tip was included in the bill and this fact was called out on the menu as “service charge of 18% included”. I haven’t been in England in many years and have no idea what they do over there.
I’m typically in the 20% club.

        Hey, blokes, a no tip system is attractive to me, but the fact on the ground here is that minimum wage for waiters here is half of what applies to everybody else. Of course it would also be great if the very concept of minimum wage did not exist, but on we go with degrees of bullshit.Clearly, UKer, you are not black, because that waiter would not have dared to call you out on your tip. There is not a waiter in the US that will not tell the same tales–blacks stiff the help, are deliberately obnoxious, rude, and potentially dangerous. Twice a year for  many years I endured the restaurant experience with my in-laws, New York Jews, and that was so bad I apologized to the help beforehand, which they appreciated. But as bad as it was it was not personal, and they were not cheap.

            No worries, UKer, we have the same debates locally. The Irish, a flinty and difficult people, are known to be bad tippers. Old Yankees can be bad at it as well. I’ve had endless arguments about it with my flinty friends. In South America, it is even more insane as it seems like anyone who even acknowledges your presence puts their hand out expecting a tip.I’m a generous tipper by rule. By generous, I tip 20% on food and beverages at dinner, unless the service was poor, in which case I leave nothing. In a strange place, I will tell the waitress upfront of my policy and I always get top-shelf service. I learned that from a Canadian. He would go into an unfamiliar bar for a night of drinking. He would take out what he expected to tip and ask the waitress for singles. He would then sit the stack on the table and tell her that it was her tip. For every minute his glass was empty, he would take away a dollar.That said, it is an insane custom.

        As much as I like America, I do not understand the whole tipping business over there. I accept that people are possibly paid less if their wages can be boosted by tips, but I’d rather pay a reasonable price or fee and not have to fork out extra in some unspoken scale just to keep people smiling. Your nation’s obsession with it puzzles me because I don’t see why people need a tip for doing their job. If you are going to use that argument then surely everyone you meet who happens to be working should be tipped. So, for example, you go into a bank and the teller serves you, do you tip them? How about the pilot of your plane for the smoothness of the landing?  Does your president get tipped when he delivers a rousing speech?(Loved the bit about equality, your highness: here’s an extra five dollars!)I was once in a restaurant in San Francisco and left a tip. Apparently it wasn’t big enough by the waiter’s measure and he shouted angrily after me as I left the place that it wasn’t enough. I found that remarkably rude and if it was designed to make me go back and give him more then the ploy didn’t work. I carried on leaving.

        Tipping is a stupid custom and I’m with the black folk on this one. No other civilised nation on the planet need bother with this ridiculous custom other than The United States. Yeah, yeah, you can drop a tip in The UK or Australia but they don’t give a shit if you don’t. If they do, tell them to shut up and get back to work. In fact, grab them by the throat and demand they get back to work. I know Americans have a garbage minimum wage. So?There is no rational argument why tipping need exist and it is a an unnecessary and annoying custom for tourists and Americans alike. Just do away with the stupidity of holding a member of staff to ransom and just pay the bill.By the way, I hate tipping and every time I am in America I tip the bare minimum regardless of the “level of service”.Go Grambling.
