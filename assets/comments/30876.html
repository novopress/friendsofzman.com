        QUOTE: “Disagreement is vital for any opposition to the regime as this is the only way to improve the opposition. Ideas need to be debated and that often results in hurt feelings, …”I fear that there’s no avoiding this as women will always be women, and Millennial &amp; Gen-Z males have been feminized to the point that they don’t recognize objective truths (Aspergers excepted), instead believing what everyone else in the tribe believes. Hurting of feelings will not be tolerated because deep in their New Millennium feminine souls they believe that what is correct is what the consensus says is correct.

        The Charlottesville protests were simply about not wanting classically beautiful statues torn down and replaced by modern art statues probably about bodily functions.

        I deleted your podcast feed because you were constantly shitting on everyone else on the right…TRS, Fuentes, Spencer, etc. I hate to see infighting on the Right at all but you havent organized anyone or done anything so it’s worse coming from you.

            If I am understanding correctly,  the concern is no enemies “to” vs “on” the right. Each has its benefits and problems. If forced to choose one or the other, I would go with “to” because it seems better to move squishes rightward.

        Seems to me Haywood’s message of NEOTR is DOA. Matt Gaetz certainly didn’t get the message. Taking a page from TomA’s playbook, the time for talking is over. It presents no real solution. The only idea of Haywood’s that has any traction is his armed patronage networks. But, having learned that he engineered the creation of the multi-chapter Society for American Civic Renewal, I begin to wonder if this former Chicago lawyer turned shampoo magnate might now be a glowie. How many Oath Keepers and Proud Boys wish they hadn’t rushed to network IRL?

        There needs to be a way to argue but in a way that keeps the focus on the enemy
Maybe rather than looking Left/Right, we should offer Above and Below.  That is, no enemies below.   We don’t have to tell the socialists and communists below what happens after the revolution, and keep them focused on the Above.  Just spitballing.
To be fair, I am a bit of an Austrian School socialist myself.

        What strikes me most about Haywood’s “No Enemies to the Right” is actually how easy it is to implement it in practice. Survivors of Buckley-esque conservatism have been programmed to denounce, denounce, denounce so it seems un-natural to just let crazies be crazies.  While Trump had many failings, he actually showed how to implement this idea.  I forget the exact details, but during the 2016 election the quintessential crazy David Duke came out to say he supported Trump.  Some MSM bimbo asked Trump about it.  The typical GOPe cuck would have prostrated himself and said “I denounce the Duke and all his works and ways.”  Trump just said 1) I don’t even know who that guy is and 2) If he’s supporting me so are millions of others.

                    The Unz Review is basically an antisemitism Grand Central Station. The only commonality uniting his bizarre menagerie of kooks and bilge writers is their proleptic insistence on blaming the Jews for everything.This is by design; Ron Unz wants it this way. The Unz Review is a honeypot designed to attract alt-right troublemakers to one spot where they can be easily watched, manipulated, and corralled.Steve Sailer is the only writer there who isn’t a rabid Jew blamer, but he’s also a fake-and-gay douchebag who really showed his colors in his recent post scoffing at Matt Gaetz’s removal of McCarthy., I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more useless and pathetic human being than Steve Sailer.

        What are we trying to define here? Right and left? Or white and anti-white? As for the former, I care very little, and use those largely meaningless terms only for brevity, and will punch “right” whenever it suits me. For the latter, things get a lot more clear cut.NEOTR is how one ends up making common cause with people named Bush, McConnell, McCain, Haley et al. The war of fighting the “left” that way has already been lost. So that today, the notion of no enemies on the right is more a question of how the conquered peoples will police themselves, than it is about being an effective political movement. I prefer to be a rambunctious, unruly, poo flinging POW rather than one who worries too much about offending the jailhouse trustees.

            This is the problem. NEOTR cuts both ways. Right now I am roflmao at the crocodile tears being shed for Frank Luntz’s boyfriend, especially from Newt Gingrich. Anybody remember Bob Michel? It was exactly the same thing.
With all respect to Haywood, we need a purge, not a group hug.

            I think you have to figure out a couple core principles and use that for the friend-enemy distinction.  I’d say our faction is pro-white and anti-oligarchy, so use that as the dividing line.  So on the right we still have enemies of Con Inc and the establishment right (pro-oligarchy), and I would argue enemies of most of the Christian Right as they turn against whites as soon as they think they can get more brown people in their church.

                Right now I’m more focused on the anti-oligarchy part of the equation. Once the oligarchs are gone the scm that they are supporting will be powerless and lost. Then we can start on part 2 and maybe accomplish something.

            Bush, McConnell, McCain, Haley, et al. were not, are not and never will be on the right. For the Right, therefore, they are irrelevant except insofar as they’re the enemy to be ground under heel. We dam’ sure don’t make common cause with those race traitors.

        “It makes it difficult to police the ranks for lunatics and crackpots.”    You don’t enflame them and set them loose on the street; that’s what pawns are for.“Populist politics has always struggled with the weirdo problem.”   At least 50% of Leftists are grotesque weirdos, doesn’t stop them because the Leftist weirdos are normalized and valorized by all the institutions.  Bio-Leninism.  The issue is that the Left controls all the levers of society.  You either have to wait for collapse or take it by force somehow.  You need street fighters who aren’t afraid of blood or jail.  Not easy to find.“The drug addled Antifa marchers oppose the system.”   No, they are financed by the system.  They are one wing of the system’s street enforcers, whether each dummy member knows it or not.  It’s the same with criminal joggers and bums out on the street; the system wants them out there terrorizing the normals.  Democrat street enforcers to keep whitey terrified.

            I don’t see right wing lunatics as worth policing.  Our worst sort of lunatic is typically a young guy with a screw loose that shoots up a synagogue and then in his suicide note says he did it for Pepe the Frog.  Then the media trumpets this as proof that the government has a mandate to cavity search everyone to stop Nazism.Thing is, let’s say it was even possible to stop this sort of thing: you’d still have nuts doing that stuff for no reason and the media will claim it was driven by the far right.  You’d still have nuts that get groomed by the Feds to do that stuff so it could be blamed on the far right.  You’d still have Jews painting swastikas on their own homes for attention.The reality is that the dissident right is always going to be accused of stealing Christmas no matter what we do short of joining the controlled opposition faction of the right.

                    You’ve got cases like Dylan Roof where the shooter identifies on the right so the right gets blamed.  Realistically he was just a screwball, but to be fair to the left the same standard holds where antifas are just violent screwballs that want an excuse to attack people.  The screwballs will always be there, the problem lies in the right accepting blame for the screwballs just like they implicitly accept blame for mustache guy and slavery.

        The more I learn about things, the more I realize I must sound like a Nazi to some people. The Nazis discredited a lot good, core ideas by being a bunch of fuck-ups. You have a rally like Charlottesville, and fuck-ups discredit it by blatantly evoking the Nazis.It’s no wonder identity politics is the thing, because we’ve been stripped of identity, and people know it , even if they can’t express it. The Nazis are the final boss, so to speak, with rediscovering Western identity. God died in the concentration camps, will is evil, peace and good order is fascist, etc. It’s something you have to go though and beyond to get back, realize you aren’t Hitler, and stop feeling guilty.Then you realize that guilt was something unjustly imposed on you, but that’s a different matter lol.

                    That’s right.  They lie about everything.  Unless you were, YOU DON’T KNOW.There is every reason to distrust the moon landings.  The Cold War maniacs were unnerved by Sputnik, so why wouldn’t they simply stage a superior achievement?  Lot of people make a damn good case that Stanley Kubrick basically admitted he was the director of the moon landing in “The Shining.”And (again) on Hitler and the Nazis. . .Just think of it this way.  Let’s say you or I had control of the microphone and the TV.  How hard would it be to make hideous Leftist figures look like evil incarnate?  Not very, because they actually are!  Forget the top-brass rulers and lackey politicians; how hard would it be to portrray the fantastically ugly lesiban Randi Weingarten look like the maniacal, murderous, perverse monster that she is?  Every bit as terrible as “Hitler” ™ has been presented?

The ethnic behind “the Landings are a hoax!” propaganda is the same ethnicity behind the militant “American Atheist Society” and, of course, Tony Levin’s “Church of Satan”.
FUD- sow fear, uncertainty, doubt.  Soon they’ll tell you there are no satellites, no Voyager, the Mars rovers and Pluto photos are fake, like white people.  There are no white people.

                        This kind of ties in with today’s topic.  The people behind the space program and the moon landings were – with apologies to those three magical negresses that apparently did all the math — white men.  Watch any footage of those events and it resembles a Klan rally in composition.
The moon landings were almost certainly the greatest accomplishment in human history.Why cast aspersions at the people we should be championing?

This was a crowning glory of White Peoples’ accomplishments, but these nihilistic twits throw it all away. Ooo, it is so bold to be such a nihilist! Got news for you pal, you fell right into their trap of denying that anything Whitey  says was good and genuine was a lie. Was Magellan’s voyage a lie? Was Koch’s work on microbes a lie? Were Watson and Crick just blowing smoke? Even if you think the moon landings were a lie, brazen it out. Don’t you know what time it is, with all of the groundwork being laid for White genocide day after day right in front of your faces?

            I was at Cville.  While some of the people who were there, myself included, find a lot to admire in national socialism, there was very little explicit cartoon nazism.  For example, there were more southern men proud of their heritage present.The widely publicized photo of the guy with the swastika flag showed that the flag still had its creases from being recently opened.  This fact, and the fact that the guy was never identified, is circumstantial evidence that this guy was an agent provocateur.From what I saw, and from all the video footage I have ever seen, no one on our side attacked first.  The shields were used for defense.The other widely criticized action there was the chant “j3wz will not replace us.”  This slogan began as “you will not replace us” and seemed to have spontaneously evolved.  While the second slogan is harsh on most ears, it has the virtue of clearly stating exactly what is being done to us and by whom.  Sometimes, people need to hear the unvarnished truth.

            Look, what people in the know are afraid to say is… the Naxi’s and Hiltler had a lot of things right, regardless of what they had wrong. Think the Nazi’s would have played this game of Saint brothah and tranny worship? Or experienced a modicum of white guilt? C’mon man!

        The “no enemies” approach may have failed in the past, but it also worked. We need look no further than the New Left, which conquered America and now rules AINO. Beginning circa 1965, when can you remember the Left, en bloc, exiling a fellow Leftist for being too radical? Perhaps it happened a time or two, but I imagine the exception would prove the rule.

            There’s a difference in category though. The left is all about the misfits and freaks, while the right is about normal and decent people. A misfit on the left still furthers the cause but freaks on the right drive off the normal people you’re trying to court. The right is about setting standards. The left is against standards.
The problem is the right let’s the left define their standards for them. So of course the standard enforcement always targets the most effective opponents of the left.

                Good point. However, what counts as a rightwing freak? Somebody who tells the plain truth about negroes, Jews and the War on Whites? If that’s freakish, then the Right itself is freakish and so is truth qua truth. And if this repels normie for the time being, so be it. As the Left’s moral integrity splinters, ours will coalesce, and what appears freakish to normie right now will one day seem as normal as apple pie. Because it is.

                    The freak side of the right are the wignats that are just Caucasian jungle bunnies who like to say the n-word, tattoo swastikas on their faces, and still typically end up with mulatto children.
There’s a reason that for decades whenever the media needed to film a white supremacist they would get a toothless hillbilly retard to put a bedsheet on.  Making the far right look gross is key to keeping people from listening to any of their ideas.

                    Well there was that one guy who wanted to join a group I was in who kept talking about something called the “Lucifer-Christ.” One guy said that as a Christian he couldn’t condone letting him in, and another said that as an Atheist he was against it too. So it was decided that he would not be allowed in the group.

            That’s the beauty of controlling the media.  “The Left” never had to worry about the NYT doing a hit piece against “The Left” by drawing attention to someone extolling the virtues of Stalin’s policies or governing.

            There was a an article just the other day calling out Kavanaugh and saying, in so many words, that he can be re-admitted to polite society if he acts as a Kennedy-esque swing vote in controversial cases. I think about this sort of thing a lot during SCOTUS season. You will never read an article praising one of the lefty judges for siding with the conservatives on the basis of principle in a controversial case, but maybe not for the most obvious reason. This isn’t about calling out “hypocrisy”, because lol. It’s not that the progs in the media will never write it, although that is true. You don’t read it because the lefty judges never, ever change sides in controversial cases. They always vote as a bloc for their chosen policy preferences, 100% of the time, and they never get scrutinized or criticized for it. This is even more true than it used to be as the Dems have nominated activist women to the court.That is what we are up against, and as far as I am concerned, the only way to fight it is to to strike back. Has a single conservative gone out there and said something like, “hey why isn’t it considered extremist for a woman to murder her unborn child?”  Of course not. But you take a step back from this frame the system opposes on us, and the lunacy becomes obvious.

            I think “respectable” cons smearing (which is not the same as snitching on) other RW whether blandly dissenting or the more common type of cardboard demon/clown is fast becoming obsolete, a victim of its own success, as such. Leftists have done their own rendition of this National Review schismatic behavior from time to time, but never got dependent on it. It is weird that being a public right-winger depends on fitting into metro-lib norms, yeah. Chris Christie comes to mind. The meddling ones control that layer of society (and have long since moved onto churches, the army, children’s gender; you name it). The most successful leftist strategy in history was hearing O’Sullivan’s/Conquest’s Law, aka “the ratchet effect,” and thinking “Hey, that’s a great idea.” I don’t believe we have a plan to undermine left-fostering institutions and that imitating their performative solidarity behavior is probably dumb, though I’m open to more explanation why it’s necessary or not for tactical reasons.

        &gt; My son told his parents at the time that Mr. Achord was trying to reach out to the boys in the class to lead them to the radical racist right. We didn’t take him seriously.

Today, my son says that watching what Achord did is a big reason that he identifies with the Left.Rod Dreher failing to transmit his values to his son and then blaming a guy whose life he ruined for it happening is peak Rod.&gt; As my son points out to me all the time, normie conservatives of my generation are really out of touch about how radical right-wingers of his generation are, based on what they’ve encountered on the Internet.This is a nice white-pill though.

                    It’s actually much worse than I expected.  I expected a lot of cucking, not a lot of destroying peoples’ lives.No punishment is too severe for a guy like him. He is a fake christian too. His god is egalitarianism and his church is progressive anti-racism.  He should really quit his church and join the Anglican church.Why did he use the words “My son told his parents at the time?”  Is he a literal cuck too?From his bio:“Raised a Methodist, he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1993, and subsequently wrote widely in the Catholic press. Covering the Catholic Church’s sex abuse scandal, starting in 2001, led him to question his Catholicism, and on October 12, 2006, he announced his conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy.”Proof he is not a Christian of any denomination.  He just went church shopping for a church that would put up with him.I just hope one day soon he suffers the consequences of his own twisted ideology. Or, after we are in power, we get to decide what his sentence will be.Thanks for the link.

        Zman, thanks for the link to your 12/22 column, “Welcome To The New Rome.”  That was well worth another reading.  Much of the Christian morality-bending to the Left started as a strategy to fold the Left into Christianity, but was pretty quickly judo-flipped by the Left to put Christians on the progressive plantation.  The upper levels of all the Christian denominations, up to and especially including the marxist pope, have completely subverted the clear meaning of scripture to placate their leftist masters.

        Charlottesville was the original J6 incident but for dissents.  Regardless of where you are on the spectrum of the right, the first step forward is not living in a dream world where you can publicly protest and not be singled out one by one, have your life destroyed and eventually have your bank accounts closed and credit cards stop working.  People with nothing to lose anyway are the shock troops of anti regime movements.  Some of them happen to be crazy which is why they never acquired much to begin with.  Usually helped out by family and friends.   People with fat pension checks coming etc. are by nature go along get along.The failed painter turned WW1 vet and went into politics later could never have emerged before the shocks of war and then inflation ravaged his country.  Simply because it created millions with nothing to lose.   Franco needed Spain to be ravaged by a government full of AOCs who liked murdering nuns to emerge victorious.   Hard reality needs to hit countries before they change.This is why we will have nothing but ensconced “geniuses” like VD Hansons muttering platitudes and dated material until history finds us, and it will.

            My default assumption is that economics never caused anything, because everyone says it causes everything.What’s meant to be invoked when Hitler™ is mentioned, the reason he’s been made the metonymic “fascist,” is his having considered leftism, criminality/degeneracy, and Jewish hostility to his people a single phenomenon that should be opposed as such. That was the common opinion of the interwar German man on the street. Leftists have lately felt safe resurrecting Rosa Luxemburg as a heroic name, now that everyone with a real memory of her is dead. Everyone “remembers” the wheelbarrows of cash, some of us know what inspired the book-burning, but nobody remembers that post-WWI Germany was in a state of violent civil war, and that war was being waged by Jews, communist and banker alike.(It’s still possible to learn about this. Look up “Spartacist uprising” and follow links. It’s lefty shit that hasn’t been used against them lately, so people are still allowed to talk about it.)What necessitated Hitler™ was the German state allowing that war to go on being waged *against the people* after the state had reached an accommodation with it. Our situation is somewhat analogous, but we’ve been “Weimar” for more than half a century. Obviously something’s different. The dollar has lost almost all of its value over that period, so it’s not economics.

                Weimar was a fast version of what we’re experiencing today just as was the French Revolution, because modern day derivatives and central banking practices didn’t exist.   Before the outbreak of WW1, in a placid, mostly well fed Germany the failed painter could have ranted in the most right wing beer hall and no one would have given him the time of day.   Look at the U.S.  today.  For all our problems the heifers at the mall bigger than ever.

        There is no longer a republican government in the United States of America.  There is only a clown show of grifters in Washington DC, enriching themselves and crushing the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  The Magna Carta was the result of tyrannical whims of King John under the concept of the “Devine Rights of Kings” to do whatever he chose.  But what is the difference between those Devine rights and the executive orders of modern day presidents?  Or the whims of government bureaucracies mandating laws without responsibility to voters, and circumventing the constitutional authority of congress?

        When I look at the professional Republicans today I only see them as of the left.    The Con-Inc people say they are of the  right but embrace various leftist positions. Sean Hannity is a good example.   The ZMan has pointed this out many times.  Left and Right are meaningless terms now.   I get it.
In my case though it is easy to have no enemies on the right.   I don’t see very many who are actually on the right.

            The distinction between Left and Right is now purely cultural. Economics, that hoary Cold War bugbear, no longer has anything to do with it. And this is what confuses most people who came of age under the old paradigm. Quoting The Wealth of Nation just doesn’t add up to sweet Fatty Arbuckle when Coca Cola is to the left of the Cornell sociology department.

                Very true.   Looking back the actual right was not in favor of offshoring industry and free trade.   Buchanan warned of the dangers of these actions.    I remember him pointing out that free trade was favored by Lenin in order to weaken society so gaining control would be easier.The result is today we have no “American” corporations.   Only multi national organizations that are not just neutral on America but are, in many cases, anti-American.Since they are ran by the elites it is no wonder they are anti America, as ZMan points out,  “What is good for them must  be bad for us.”   Otherwise it could not be good for them.  I give you Bud Light.

This^^^.  Exactly right.  I say this all the time when I comment.  Race is the only thing that matters.  It is the only thing that matters to the “left” and it should be the only thing that matters to us.  You are either White or you’re against us.

        I don’t keep track of the cool kids and their feuds on the tight. All I know from my perch out here in the outhouse… is that conservatives have to clean their house. The weirdos are not the only enemies we have. They have to be turfed without mercy or hesitation. The way forward is easily stated but a complete boar to implement. We have to define who we are, and what we want. Anyone who is not on the team has to be kicked off. We have to hold to a standard, we have to be seen doing it, because in time we are going to have to clean out our enemies on the left – or there WILL be a reign of terror and maybe even worse things. They are sewing the seeds of it with gay abandon as we speak.What in hell happened to the speaker of the house yesterday? Not trying to be a dink, I’m Canadian so I don’t know… but that was a win for Our Side, was it not? From up here…it looks like you guys nudged the Overton Window a bit? If so…good on ya!

            It’s near-meaningless things like House leadership votes that tell us who our “to the right” is. We don’t have to care who’s Speaker to know that anyone who objects to McCarthy losing his job is our enemy “to the left,” i.e., on the side of the establishment.
Coincidentally, Sailer and Ace today deployed the same Twitter-addict soyism, “It’s almost as if…,” in their almost identical claims that Republican votes against McCarthy were irresponsible.

        Well, this is why it’s important to know what you’re for, not what you’re against, i.e., having a positive identity.When you know what you’re for and say it clearly, it’s not hard to criticize or approve of what others write or do.For example, if I’m for whites joining the identity politics games and maybe even someday having our own communities, I can still side and work with colorblind CivNats who oppose the anti-white agenda when they’re working toward that objective because it helps my cause. When they move toward pushing for a colorblind agenda, we part ways.Basically, it’s not about Right or Left. It’s about your agenda. When a group or writer brings something up that moves my agenda forward, I’m willing to work with them and publicly approve of their goal. When that group or person brings up something that hurts my agenda, I’ll also say so.

Does he live in some sort of alternate reality where these ruthless right-fights are really a thing? Frankly, the whole posture looks LARPy and ridiculous to me.There is a much bigger problem with No Enemies on the Right, and that is that in defining itself entirely as a reaction to the Left, it implies that the Right really has nosubstantivebeliefs of its own. This is a fatal error in the so-called Dissident Right which is expressed in its very name. A dissident is defined by his reaction to the regime, and dissident movements fall apart no later than the regimes to which they are opposed to fall apart.The Dissident Right, and all the personalities that have become notable within it, have capitalized on popularizing niche topics that the mainstream narrative either handles inadequately or does not handle at all. But, as we have learned time and time again, this does not mean that they are independent thinkers or that they have some valuable truth to offer. They are unexceptional people with conventional lives who can’t offer any alternative vision or coherent leadership, because it’s not in them in the first place.On the other hand, people who have real, substantive traditionalist positions that go against the mainstream may find themselves lumped on the Right out of habit, but that does not mean that they now have an obligation to make common cause with New Atheists and pro-aborts who happen to be snarky regime critics.

            It may be true that there are no beliefs that define the dissident right other than hatred of the left.We both agree that with TomA’s point that the most important act for an individual is to align himself with quality people whom he can trust in real life.Not that I expect anyone to care, but my version of “No enemies on the right” is:  no enemies who are race realists that acknowledge the power of tribalism over non-whites.Although the left is my most powerful enemy, my most significant enemies are race blind conservatives/libertarians and race realists that believe that we can form a society based on meritocracy/high IQ.  From my perspective, these people are gatekeepers and off-ramps that prevent others from seeing the reality of race and the primacy that tribalism has for almost all non-whites.  However, as CItizen Silly points out, we can work with them in fighting the left.Within the group that I identify with, I expect that there will be both religious people and non-believers and should we ever carve out territory for ourselves, the best plan is to allow the two groups to live separately in a federation of mutual self-defense.

            Who says the Right defines itself in contradistinction to the Left? In point of fact, on matters such as economics and even the environment, the Right now shares common ground with the Left. In point of fact, all that really defines the Right right now is white identitarianism. Now white identitarianism is not as simple and straightforward as it may prima facie appear, but this is where philosophy and strategy enter the picture. They provide defintion and they delineate tactics.As for traditionalism, it is largely coterminous with the Right. You will not find many people on the Right who reject the traditions–including Christianity–of white civilization. (Even most rightwing athiests see the value of Christianity as a cultural adhesive.) What’s more, traditionalism even applies to non-whites in a rightist way. Hence, to all peoples their traditions, and to all peoples their own lands. This is a blueprint for dismantling multicultural abominations and fostering a more irenic world in which all people are satisfied because they live among their own kind and in accordance with their own traditions, beliefs and history.

Charles Haywood said that. It’s in the manifesto he wrote, that is linked to in the OP. I don’t agree with that notion, which is why I was criticizing it.

            This is wrong. In the USSR there was a diverse array of people who opposed the regime from traditional monarchists to people who wanted a market economy and many others. They were united in their opposition to the regime and all were better off after it fell.Haywood has a good definition of what the left is metaphysically and it makes sense to unite against it.The political struggle never ends. Man is a political animal.

        …you must have some way to filter out the lunatics or you end up being defined by them—That’s generally been my issue with any “no enemies on the right” mantra as it has always been used as a cover by crazies and conmen.  At this point though I think an ideology is coalesced enough to be defined loosely as “what is good for the future of white people as a group?” and that it should at least be enough to squeeze out grifters like Dreher.

        With due respect, Mr, Heywood, in his article, sounds like a Jacobin or, better, a Rightest Bolshevik who, like the apocryphal cowboy, hopped on his horse, brandished his gun,  and rode off in all directions. When it comes to The Left and the Right, his criterion of discernment sounds basically like a smell test conducive to the likelihood of fomenting a Reign of Error.
I despaired of Rod Dreher when he consistently refused to follow through on the principles and program he laid out in the Ben Op. What, then, was the point?

                    Oddly, while MLK Blvd in Oakland is no great shakes although far from the worst part of that notorious city, once it gets into Berkeley it becomes pretty decent, runs along the west side of downtown, and becomes even a bit upscale when it reaches the north side of town. Its name then changes to the much tonier The Alameda. Of course I wish they had just kept the old name, Grove St.

I swear, I used to be a nice guy. That guy seems like ancient history; I can barely remember him. Now, I am a guy who enjoys laughing. Guffaws, silent laughs, belly laughs, snorting laughs, even (I am embarrassed to admit) giggles on occasion … The white leftist never ceases to entertain as they trundle towards the mass graves, dragging us along with them.

            Jeez, he could’ve at least fought back when the jogger was advancing on him with clear intent.  Gotta give yourself a fighting chance and if you die at least go out with a shred of dignity.
At that point you HAVE to fight even if the aggressor is twice your size; which this aggressor was not.
Survival and good sense have been brainwashed out of generations.

            Noticed that you got a downvote for your comment. I agree with your sentiment. I think that the only way that the White race will survive in this country (or the world for that matter) is to follow the quote from “The Outlaw Josie Wales”.To wit: “Remember, when things get bad and it looks like you’re not gonna make it, then you gotta get mean. I mean plumb, mad-dog mean. Cause if you lose your head and give up then you neither live nor win. That’s just the way it is.”Stop thinking of the animals as people worthy of pity or compassion. Like my favorite uncle said when I was a kid, “some people are alive just because it’s against the law to kill them.” Amen.

        I have been assured by someone who met him that Dreher is every bit as passive-aggressive and snobbish in person as he comes across in print.Dreher is morbidly fascinating. He throws his dead sister under the bus. He throws his dead dad under the bus. He doxes a schoolteacher apparently in some sort of weird tag team with his now-ex-wife. He blames his family for the divorce; none of his siblings or cousins will speak to him. He runs off to Hungary and gets a lot of traction in Europe where nobody knows about his history as a family wrecking-ball.The last I bothered to look some of his stuff up, he was whining that Andrew Sullivan had chewed him up and spit him out in a debate on human sexuality. Of course Dreher blamed this on, who else, his family, especially mean old dad. What a freaking head-case.

Every small-town person knows this type. Reasonably high IQ guy who leaves his village, gets too big for his britches, and starts talking about his childhood friends with either sniveling contempt or passive-aggressive condescension.

            “Passive-aggressive” is correct. Many of these Con, Inc., grifters are little wannabe bullies who get full erections watching the monstrous Left terrorize the people they claim to give a voice. The biggest laugh I got from Dreher was watching him meltdown after someone compared him to David French, and concluding his defense with cuckish praise of French. Those two truly need to be institutionalized.

                I would assume in retrospect, TAC considers it a significant error that they let a donor pay them to give Dreher a platform where he had no oversight or editing at all. Ron Unz said he was there biggest driver of web traffic while he was publisher, but still not worth it.

            I read his response to Haywood that Haywood has a link to at the end of his blog post.  Chet Rollins is right, he truly hates his upbringing and the area of Louisiana he is from. He drug his wife and kids back there when his sister got cancer like he was going to be some sort of savior and when they didn’t fall on the faces to praise him for it, he wrote a book basically trashing them in a passive aggressive way.  I thought it was funny at the time of the Achord dox that Dreher and his ex wife didn’t consider divorcing without Biblical cause disqualifying for her to work at a Classical Christian school but considered Achord wanting to live in a white community and nation beyond the pale. Only one of those things is condemned in the Bible though.

        I don’t personally know anyone that engages in these arcane internecine political battles and I only get exposed to this nonsense in posts like this one. More importantly, I don’t think we can cure what ails us by trying to refine our macro-scale conduct in some presumed optimum fashion. If you’re dying of cancer, what difference does it make if you have Tourette’s syndrome.The strategy of rallying the masses only works if you have a quality electorate and the game is not rigged by fraud. And neither of the above exist in modern day America. We are becoming a progressively worse population and dead people are casting ballots in staggering quantities. None of this will change based upon some massaging of one’s interpersonal communication skills.Better is to identify others who are smart, strong, robust and still have some integrity. Yes, its a small pool, but we don’t need an army to remedy the root of the problem. We need a strategy that can actually succeed and then smarter decision-making with respect to what, where, when, and how. The Titanic is sinking and its fatally useless to waste effort arguing about the debating rules on the way down.

There is only one goal, we win, they lose. Fight fire with fire. Nice guys finish last. Lunatic or not, that guy to my right is not an enemy if we need him to win. We’ll sort it all out after we defeat the real enemy.

            ToMA, do you live in a deep red county?  If you do, you can most certainly make a difference for your neighbor and your family.  Yes, the federal level is beyond saving, but our local community is not.  Right here in Idaho, I have witnessed the very phenomenon Haywood describes.  We recently had “normie” Christian conservatives (unwittingly?) being used to create a wedge withing the resurgent Right here.  It was the usual playbook of demanding we disown all “groypers” and Christian Nationalists. We took the NEOTR approach however, and we’re stronger than ever.  Meanwhile, those useful “conservative” idiots now have a scarlet letter on their forehead.  They will still be accepted, so long as they further our conservative cause, but never again will they be trusted.

        I asked Zman to write about this and I’m very grateful he did. This was fantastic. I would encourage Zman to post a link to this on Twitter.If the Right combined Haywood’s principles with Zman’s post-Charlottesville essays/podcast on the proper public behavior for the Right, I think it would be an excellent platform for the Right’s movement.A great example is Matt Gaetz. This guy may be a douchebag, but he has rendered a great service to the Right in ousting McCarthy. The people piling on Gaetz on Twitter and in the media are clearly grifters and they are “outing” themselves in real time. I hope people keep receipts.

            “The people piling on Gaetz on Twitter and in the media are clearly grifters and they are “outing” themselves in real time. I hope people keep receipts.”Right? The stupidity exceeds the grift.As for Gaetz, that is one who escaped the clutches of the Deep State and is making it pay. There will be more like him, and of course the Regime will try to be more accurate with its aim in response. As I understand it, the cucks were getting ready to expel Gaetz after framing him for statutory rape failed. Whoops. This is my favorite thing so far this year. The next 12 months will be lit AF.

            It is incredible to see people expose themselves. Like, getting rid of a useless, shill, parasite like McCarthy is only a bad thing if you are running a massive grift and you want it to keep going. I’ve said this a million times but the Republican party is dead. You saw it last week with that cast of ghouls on the debate stage and you saw it yesterday. They keep fighting against the dying of the light but it’s just not happening. The people don’t want Republican party do-nothing uniparty governance. The people want Trump and they want MAGA. Either you bring it to them or they will find someone else who does. This is even more true of the young people who find all this stuff funny. They want to see the government shut down because they see it as preferable to the government doing what they normally do every day, which is to actively harm them. They don’t think Democrats and liberalism is cool and they see the Republicans as willing participants to sell their birthright down the river. It’s completely over.

        ” What we insist on calling the Right in America is primarily a policing operation. ”Exactly. It may be rearranging chairs on the deck of the Titanic, and too little, too late, but any chance at salvaging our people starts with eliminating Con, Inc.We see this with what happened to the Speaker of the House last night. Matt Gaetz’ marksmanship very well may have averted World War III AND sunk the GOP as controlled opposition. Rod Dreher hardest hit.As for freaks, lunatics, Alt-Right carnies…do what the Left does. Use them and hide them on an as-needed basis. They are cannon fodder.

            Yeah, I think focusing only on the Left and ignoring their enablers is a huge mistake and may be a deliberate one by people like Chris Rufo and others. I get the sense that many of these newly minted culture warriors would like to occupy the offices of Conservative Inc because they like the view, not because they despise their politics.

                As others have pointed out, Charlie Kirk and Matt Walsh and their ilk are now espousing positions they once considered grounds for banning from the public square. It likely is more opportunism than conversion. I actually think they can be useful as long as they are treated with the healthy distrust they have richly earned. Keep forcing them rightward, in other words, and fully realize they don’t mean a word of it and are never to be trusted.

                    I think they have made some genuine progress moving right, especially Walsh. It has been awhile since I have seen them participate in denouncing someone on the right when the left demands it. This has been one of the biggest areas of improvement. Still don’t trust them, but they are a lot better than the IDW crowd.

                    It is a good example of it is important to focus on the message and not the man. Cheer the good messages, regardless of course, within reason, and jeer or ignore the bad messages. When Kirk says something smart, reward him with praise. When he says something stupid, reward him with boos. When one of our guys says something stupid, politely ignore it.

                Rufo is an interesting case. He is no longer ideologically in on colorblind, he is in due to his mate selection. These guys love being close to power for certain. The worst of them is this sodomite Douglas Murray. What a supercilious, smug, finger pointer that guy is.Jared Taylor interviewed some guy, Brodow yesterday. He has a new book, “The War on Whites.” Taylor asked him what he sees as hopeful signs that America can be a successful multi-cultural society, and Brodow responded that increasing inter-racial couples was one. So, the great white champion sees misceginating out as the great sign of hope. You can’t make this stuff up it is so clownish.I do think what Taylor did was masterful. Brodow also commented that another sign of hope was the number of blacks getting more education. Taylor twice countered with the reality that the most educated blacks and most high rising are the most vitriolic anti-whites. Brodow had no answer. I suspect he is not very bright, but bright enough to know he can’t go too far. The same is true of Chris Caldwell. He wrote this book saying how the Civil Rights Regime was gas and a match to the Constitution. He gets an interview on Vox and just cowers and cucks the entire interview. He got owned when he should and could have trounced the interviewer without mercy.What is my point? Well, there is question of whether the Rufos, Brodows, Caldwells … … are critiquing and summarizing in a safe little box and are ignorant of solutions or they are well aware of the only things that will fix things but will never say them out loud.For this particular topic of anti-white, I think a rule should be only whites are to be listened to. I think a debate on colorblind should be had, but in the end someone proposing fighting the anti-white regime with colorblind as the solution is not to be trusted. They are to the Left and fair game. It is only a matter of if and how they can be used to push the Overton Window in our direction.In the meantime, Biden showed up at ProPubblica (see founders and funders), and said that The Left must show respect for the minority Americans of European ancestry. He said something about nothing conceded financially to them but they must say nice things. Then he went on to say there will be no, “hate”, allowed. He will drive hate underneath the rocks and not allow any oxygen underneath them.He just announced for The Regime their plan for us, which of course we know. We are going to be a minority and any dissent or complaint or peep of resistance is, “hate”, that will be driven under a rock. War was officially declared for one of his paymasters over at ProPubblica. I suspect, Rufo, Brodow, Caldwell and others may only prove useful if they are squashed by hard power. Expect them to prattle on about remaining colorblind.Who can we pull rightward though? This guy may be one:https://amgreatness.com/2023/10/02/no-jobs-for-white-men/Note his solution is to go underground and grovel, not to punch the regime back in the mouth using the options at our disposal. Is he a fink too? Hard to know. One thing is for certain. Peddlers of colorblind and surrender are not to the right and not to be trusted. Finally, Dreher. What a sniveling little coward. Run and hide and then go to Hungary and bite pillows after ruining people and his family. I hope his wife left him for outing that school teacher as a final straw. What a limp retractor that coward is.

                    Dreher’s ex wife and at least one of kids are well to his left politically. In his response to Haywood, Dreher says his oldest son “identifies with the left” because he saw through the way Achord was trying to lead kids into white nationalism.  His ex wife resigned her teaching job at the school in protest of Achord having worked there.

        One of the things I have noticed about normie conservatives is their penchant to be willingly corralled by leftist denunciations of Nazis. They enthusiastically join in on the Outrage-over-the-Holocaust-narrative-event-of-the-day, while never seriously demanding their progressive brethren do the same for Stalinism. The outrage and emotional breast-beating always moves in one direction, and these idiots cannot understand the damage they are doing. This is like sawing off the limb you are sitting on.
