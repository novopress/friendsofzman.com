        It all begins with the whiny “I care more than you do” noises among the left. It is never enough simply to be more caring about the world, but even more important to show how much more you care than your fellow travellers.
The level of anxiety and tension that surrounds such intense competitive caring usually breaks out into spitting contests before too long. As was made clear in Life Of Brian, it is the splitters in The Judean People’s Front that most annoy the The People’s Front of Judea.

        At the wide base of the Pyramid of Aggrieved Victims, there was room for all of these whiny groups of complainers to fit.  No friction, no stress.  But as each group pushed its own Me First agenda to the forefront at the cost of the other movements striving to do the same, they each discovered that the pyramid becomes very narrow very fast towards the top, and so there’s not enough room there for everyone.  And that is when the friction begins to hurt as they rub against each other the wrong way.  A good Pharaoh could probably keep all of these people in his pyramid happy, giving a bit of lip service to one group and then tossing a few crumbs of pita bread to another.  But unfortunately, King Barry is not a wise or adept Pharoah, and so his pyramid, built on sand,  is starting to collapse.

        Opposite Day with Liberalist America:Preach tolerance whilst enacting Zero Tolerance Laws.Condemn European invasion into America and welcome Latino invasion.Support gay, feminist and muslim rights – no irony there.Sneer at Christianity, devote its soul to the Cult of Liberalism.Liberalism in practice is why Liberalism in theory doesn’t work. That should be patently unmistakable of course, but as you say, these guys and girls (and those in between whom I have probably insulted by now) just won’t learn their lessons. They keep coming back for more and more and keep punching themselves in the faces.Conservatives aren’t their worst enemy. We stand on the sideline grimacing.
