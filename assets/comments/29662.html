Intelligence is learning from your mistakes. Wisdom is learning from someone else’s.

        America is Sal’s pizzeria from “Don’t the right thing.”  You got the hardworking well meaning white man who makes good food and a quality place for the blacks in da hood.
But the second an agitator and bully come in and give Sal hell, try to make him kneel to their insane demands, try to kill him, the rest of the “community” does not rally to Sals defense.  Pizzeria goes up in flames.
Making radically different groups live together is pure psychological cruelty and only propagated by those who are sadistic  and stand to profit in money and power.

        Only conservative whites (suckers) ever tried to live/believe merit based creedalism and civnattery.  The rest are completely COMPLETELY tribal and hostile all the time.
The only creed I care for is Apollo, but certainly not his bitch ass son.

        A country based on creedalism deserves no loyalty. It’s not an accident that the last war America won was prior to the era of creedalism. Few men are willing to fight and die for any creed, and even fewer for the creedalism of modern America.Unlike the UK, America has never experienced a significant outmigration of its native white population. In the UK it has become common for young white people, including college-educated men, to emigrate for greener pastures. There is a trickle forming in America, and I expect that trickle to grow to a steady stream.One of my kids emigrated last year, likely never to return. Another one is thinking about leaving in a year or two. If the Democrats win in 2024, which is likely, I will start planning to emigrate upon retirement.Five of my ancestors signed the Mayflower Compact. My ancestors have fought in every significant military conflict in American history, and pre-American history. If you had told me forty years ago that my family would quit America I would have laughed in your face. It’s No Country for Old Men.

            Things are about to come to a head. An economic collapse or near-collapse, which could happen in the immediate future, will accelerate the exodus. A smart country would seek to encourage White Americans to immigrate there. I knock them frequently, but American Whites are among the smartest, most inventive people the world has known. AINO doesn’t deserve them and will not survive without them. What you see with the third-rate performing but first-rate funded military, similar to the public schools, is the future of America. Places like Uruguay likely will become top destination points.

                Uruguay has crossed my mind, as has Hungary and Russia. It would be very wise of these countries to first ask, “Do we want this person? Does this person understand why America failed?” Or else they’re risking importation of America’s poison into their own ecosystem. They need to do extensive questioning and research into American whites to see if they believe in gender extremism or DIE initiatives.There’s often a heated debate amongst dissidents on here about whether it’s right to stand and fight or leave. Without restarting that debate, I think it’s the responsibility of dissidents that emigrate to fully inform the decision makers in their new countries of the real American failures and what to look out for. Because undoubtedly, dissidents are going to be the first to recognize what is happening and be the first waves of emigrés to leave (as has already begun amongst dissidents).

                That’s not wrong, but it’s not entirely correct. This is where I fall away from a lot of the people here. There are people of good will of many races in America who, left to their own devices, could find accommodations to the differences that divide us. For those of us of a certain age, Zman periodically writes about the old-time televised Roasts, which exploited those differences for humorous effect. We acknowledged and patched over differences in the past, and between people of good will we can do it again.Collectively, we have allowed the radical left to exploit those differences in a way that allows them to take control. This is what we have to stop. And we can.All the woke silicon valley corporate BS is collapsing, and fast. I have a front-row seat to it. As it turns out, allowing confused transexuals to bring their whole selves to work doesn’t result in better outcomes in a world in which interest rates are not zero.

                    I hope that you are correct Guest, but you sound like a person who has never lived in a place where whites do not have an overwhelming majority.
When I have lived in places where whites did not have a clear majority, then the non-whites attack the whites and the reasonable non-whites do not step in to stop the attacks.  This is non-white tribalism, which is stronger than shared values.

                        One must define “non-Whites” a bit better.  Here where I live, Whites are in the minority, the majority are Hispanic.  There are no race riots—not yet anyway.  However, what come about is poor management on the government level, poor public schools, and a lower tax base.  In short, incompetence that would be predicted by IQ.
Moving elsewhere for opportunity and good government is of course common, but we are allowed to live separate in our own areas for the most part—for now.  I’d settle for that in my old age.

                        Compsci’s caveat is correct. It is not, in my opinion, PoC per se that are the chief problem, it is blacks. Life is liveable, although certainly not ideal, amid non-black PoC. It is the presence of blacks, anywhere upward of 20 percent, that makes the mere act of existing almost intolerable.

                    Prior to the New Left’s hegemony, which began in the 60s, race relations between blacks and whites (and those are the only relations that really matter) were far better than they are today, but they still weren’t good. The only factor that kept black dysfunction reasonably in check was the dominance of white culture and the willingness of whites–sometimes extra-legally–to use force. This kept the lid on the pressure cooker.Alas, no matter how you slice it, diversity–or difference, if you will–is the source of all conflict, and this truth will inevitably manifest itself in an extremely pernicious manner regardless of socioeconomic and political conditions. It’s only a matter of time.

            Furthermore, saying that America defeated fascism is self delusion…Russian communists defeated fascism, did 80% of the fighting against Hitler’s best soldiers, admittedly with a lot of supplies from the US…Patton said that we had fought the wrong enemies, because communism was much worse than Hitler…

            Sort of.  One thing that boggles my mind is meeting a European.  They seem to get off on telling Americans “you’re not a real Irishman!  I’m an Irishman from Ireland!”  Or whatever nationality they are.  Many of us would kill for some connection to the culture of the old country but in my experience they constantly disavow us.  I’m not sure if that’s a post WW2 sentiment or the contagion of civil rights sweeping from here across Europe.  We’ll see how well Irish-born Africans fit in.Maybe that’s what makes some of us so nostalgic about Europe or racially conscious.  We don’t just encounter other Europeans on vacation here.  In big American cities,  We have to grow up with blacks, South Americans, Chinese, Arabs and shameless Jews who collectivize blatantly.  Some of us might have “United” as Americans but others of us always identified as Italian American or German American.

        We still have a creed. Hatred of Straight White men. It is the creed that unites the coalition of the Ascendant, educated White women (who HATE HATE HATE White men with a passion), blacks, ((())), Muslims, Indians, Chinese etc. [Hispanics seem to be unwilling to join the black party]. Hatred of them is just the fundamental value all these groups share and informs every action they take.It is why Bud Light deliberately did things to alienate its core customers that they hate so much (straight White men) to get “better” customers — the Alphabet people but putting an Alphabet + person on their cans. Jack Daniels sponsors RuPaul “events” regularly, because they want the Alphabet + far more than their icky Southern White male customers who they hate as well. Comic books, they alienated the older White guys who remembered them fondly as kids, and young White boys who are the natural purchasers, in favor of the Alphabet + people over and over again. Hatred of Straight White men is the DNA of the current coalition and the founding new creed. You can see the coalition of Alphabet+ people, various  professional White women (like Bud’s Director of Marketing, wealthy, White, went to Groton Prep and Harvard) and grievance mongering Indians, Chinese, blacks etc. in business after business. For example Ike Perlmutter, friend of Trump and fired Disney Exec, notes that Disney execs only care about box office not profits, and cared more about virtue signaling against DeSantis than making money. That is the creed in action.This sort of creed can go on as long as there is enough Straight White Male labor support to keep the lights on. That is basically it. On their own without coerced labor from our group their groups cannot even keep the lights on. Or trucks moving, rail cars from derailing, barges from crashing into dam locks, etc. The US Navy is committed to Rainbow Nation, with diversity/Alphabet + recruiting and “safe spaces” etc. according the Sec Nav testimony the other day.The Ottomans after the fall of the Mongols up to the rise of the Russians, did not face serious competitors and were able to use slave labor from Eastern Europe to be the higher IQ forced labor to build and maintain their imperial works and even adventure into India against the Portugese. The Ottoman experience in India suggest that a slave navy had serious limits, far more so than a slave army. Can a “kinder, gentler” sort of serfdom of White guys at the very bottom expected to fight and die for the Colors of Benetton succeed? My guess is no, and likely to be shown no very soon in the Western Pacific. But that’s just me.

                It ought to be common knowledge at this point that Sailer is a joke and always has been. Why anyone ever took him seriously is a genuine mystery, unless you realize that the IYIs are such a gelatinous blob that they will accept any guru who gives them a shape to occupy.

            A war in the westpac will be mostly about the tech and not so much about the men. Since it will be a sea/air war, not a land war. Sailors as warriors = guys (or pink haired trannies) on a ship who push a button to launch a missile. Increasingly that is the pilots too. It doesn’t take a “warrior.” I don’t really think it matters much at all whether it is Harold, Shameequa, or Miss Fabulous pushing the button. Although when it comes to onboard system maintenance and repair there’s a clear preference for the white dude.So whoever has better missile/torpedo tech etc. will win round 1. And then whoever can do a better job of building (and manning) stuff to replace what they expended/lost in round 1 will have the advantage in round 2.If China took a stab at invading Taiwan, I think there’s an excellent chance the GAE would repulse their first attempt. After that, hard to say.

        I realize that this attack on “creedalism” is the Zman’s particular axe to grind. I guess if you’re going to sustain the effort of writing a daily blog over many years (admittedly an impressive feat), then you have to have an axe to grind, some sort of emotional trigger to keep the energy flowing, and this happens to be Zman’s. That’s why it works its way into every post he writes.However, I’m not sure the point needs any more repeating. It just isn’t that relevant. To the extent that this sort of framing actually explains anything, it’s outlived its usefulness. I mean, I’m in my early 40s, and I have to think back to the ’90s to remember a time when creedalism even had any sort of popular traction. To me, it always seemed like a Boomer fetish, something that pertained only to the Rush Limbaugh generation and didn’t really exist before or since. It certainly wasn’t anything I took to heart, and you would be hard pressed to find anyone my age or younger who ever did.But furthermore, there is the question of whether the framing itself is accurate, Perhaps the whole idea that the failure of the American culture today is a result of the failure of creedalism, is itself an artefact of a particular worldview that doesn’t map well onto reality.Perhaps the truth is that America was always destined to fail, should have failed long before now, and that the only lesson to learn is that Americanism is a heresy. America began its existence as a pirate outpost of the British empire, legitimized itself with the shallow philosophy of the misnamed Enlightenment, and has been nothing but a racket ever since.The traditional view, the Catholic view, the perennial view, the metahistorical view, is that modern, Western parliamentary democracies represent revolts against truth and reason and are basically simply long-running palace coups wherein the court tries to govern without the king.I will be listening carefully to the show tomorrow on the Germanization of Christianity. Remember, true Christianity never changes; any alteration to it simply creates an heretical sect, not an “evolution of Christianity.” Just remember, tomorrow is Good Friday so I entreat you to be respectful. I will evaluate the results with commentary.

            But I thought true Christianity had never been tried!Spain became Brazil and Mexico.France became Indochina and Algeria.  Germany and Russia were also Christian empires.

            Civnat G. Normiecon is the one to whom the creed still means something. If you think creedalism has no traction you must not spend much time around him. The regime tries to wear creedalism as a fig leaf, in an effort to keep him from ever wising up. Trying to get the civnat to see through that is, for now, the main raison d’etre of the DR.

                    That could be, but the younger boomers and older Xers who still believe, aren’t going anywhere anytime soon, and judging by our geriatric ruling class, don’t seem likely to let go of the power for a long time either. So we could be stuck with them for another 30 years.

            Yeah, it’s too bad that you got downvoted a lot because your comment was really profound and important.We have to accept the possibility that the whole American Experiment was doomed from the start because men simply cannot be governed en masse within in a Constitutional Republic. It may have been a plan entirely dependent on the quality of the governed.The difference between you and Zman is that you think we we doomed to failure because of systemic reasons (republican form) and Zman is focused on the “quality of the governed” (even Franklin and John Adams understood this). These positions aren’t too far apart.The synthesis is that the “quality of the governed” is the dominant factor. Both you and Zman have consistently asserted this. Systems matter, and I have said this often here. But inputs are also crucial.I have challenged folks here for a manifesto. Many smart commenters here (like 3g4me and others) have basically said “my people are my manifesto”. This is a compelling argument.Happy Easter to all!

                I agree with you.As I have mentioned here previously, Carl Schmitt is right that there can be no functioning legal order without a sovereign ie king or decisive decision maker to resolve disputes and unite the people, or at least the elites. During his lifetime Washington performed this function whether in or out of office and prevented fighting between federalists and republicans.If the USA has been a monarchy there would have been no civil war.Z man has made similar comments in line with Schmitt’s worldview that all genuine political philosophy assumes people are evil / sinful and selfish. Elites wanting to sustain their own power.This is why believe republics only kind-of work in small city states, not large empires. Otherwise, due to the sinful nature of man, elites will look for any justification to build alliance and grow their wealth and power.This is the story of US history, consolidation of power. Lincoln, the old left promising free shit with FDR, the new left promising status to various victim groups. It’s all about building party alliance to monopolize state power and create a 1 party state. Once unity under 1 man is achieved ie Stalin, Mao, the leftism stops. And the government can and does hire competent people again. Like a king does.Because of people’s flawed nature the monarchy is the best people can do/hope for.

            Daring them to kill another Kennedy eh? Well, that’s a bold move anyway. Not sure about voting for him. I’d need to know more. Since voting is probably useless anyway though I might go for it. I also like the National Justice Party though I need to know more about them too. They supposedly do “good works” stuff and not just talk which is a move in the right direction. The various Muslim radical parties in the ME do this too and always have a large “social work” component that helps real people with real needs and helps build the foundations of a state-within-a-state.

                Mike Enoch is the main guy at the NJP, you might know him as the nice fellow with the jewish ex wife who got mysteriously dismissed from the C-ville lawsuit because (representing himself) he was just too smart for all the biggest hebrew lawfirms with the deepest pockets.  His expert legal maneuvers worked for no one else on our side though and they’ll go to jail or be consumed by endless lawfare and then financially destroyed and unpersoned.He’s a real lucky guy, right?  You’d think that someone in the lead of the left’s new pearl harbor number one bad guy racist type event… who then is starting a public explicitly counter semitic pro white political party would be the government/ADLS biggest target, but nope!  Along with Anglin they just let him go right back to bad optics headquarters and carry on as the face of open white advocacy.Hope you’re just as lucky as Mike Enoch and Anglin if youre willing to be associated with them.  Wouldnt want to be UMlucky like those J6ers who followed federal agents into the capitol or the Proud Boys that discovered in court that their leadership was shot through with federal agents.

        Another lesson of history worth considering.The Eastern Roman Empire faded slowly over several centuries and the people of the Italian peninsula have never since re-emerged to greatness. And yet, both the Japanese and German empires of WW2 collapsed suddenly following defeat, but those nations thereafter rose up to become economic powerhouses within two generations; Germany as the economic engine of Europe and ditto for Japan in East Asia. What enabled this restoration?it has been argued that both were denuded of post-war military expense, which enabled a focus solely on domestic priorities. Plus both populations endured enormous hardship following the war’s end, which hardened the survivors and forced a strong work ethic. IOW, the sharp change in environment was instrumental in fostering eventual redemption.The slow road into the ditch results in a lukewarm collapse much like the Roman Empire. And this will likely result in a lukewarm incentive to change away from prior mistakes. But worst of all, you will get lukewarm hard men on the other side. For example, trannies and poseurs pretending to be women and beating them in women’s sports while asserting they can have babies.The collapse is the cure, and it needs to happen soon and needs to force real hardship onto all.

            “but those nations thereafter rose up to become economic powerhouses within two generations; Germany as the economic engine of Europe and ditto for Japan in East Asia. What enabled this restoration?”We did.  They are vassels and the favorites you see being played now in our own economy is exactly what we’ve been doing internationally for decades.  Don’t you find it odd that the first industries we sacrificed wasn’t due to China, no, because both Japan and most of Europe kept those industries.  Just like Ford and GM not selling cars anymore, but Korea increases its share of the market along with Japan and Europe.  Heck look at actors, most before the year 2000 were american.  Sometime around the mid 2000’s they all started to become british, australian, european.  Its how we keep the vassals inline, heck its how we keep the populacein line.  Take this Jab or you ain’t working in this town again!  Look to see what countries succeed in industries we used to dominate and you will find a loyal American vassal.

                The only reason Japan hasn’t exploded and become nationalist again after their fun with debt in the 80’s and 90’s is because of us.  They’ve printed so much their money should be considered monopoly money.  Being linked to the dollar is the only thing that has stopped that.  People say but the Japanese save more then they spend, yes and that is because we give their products favored status in most markets and protect them.  While selling our own populace short and trying to offset the loss of industry with Higher Education, Healthcare, and tech.  None of those industries would be where they are without explicit government support and favorable positions with regards to federal money printing.

            The genetic fitness of Germany and Japan are also noteworthy here. And their subsidization by GAE. Although I think the sudden vs. gradual collapse you bring up is also a large factor, perhaps the main thing that differentiates them from Italy. Which still gave us Ferraris, high fashion, astronomy, fine art etc.
What I’m getting at is, if you tried to engineer the same sudden collapse and GAE facilitated rebirth in Mozambique I don’t think you would get similar results to Germany and Japan.

            “The Eastern Roman Empire faded slowly over several centuries and the people of the Italian peninsula have never since re-emerged to greatness.”
Or to cite a more recent example, the post-1945 decline of the British Empire.  A century ago, the sun never set or British Imperial dominions.  Today, the Empire has all but disappeared and Britain itself is firmly a second-tier nation.

                    It is truly frightening to think of how much worse the UK could get after it’s status as 51st state is withdrawn. I’m picturing the whole island becoming a giant Pakistani-run whorehouse and porn studio. Maybe they can augment that income by cooking designer drugs for use on the continent and in the newly liberated People’s Republic of New York.

            No it was literally genetics.Emil Kirkegaard has a paper showing decline in Roman IQ measured from ancient DNA samples due to dysgenics AND immigration from northern Africa. Ancient Romans had higher genotypic IQ than modern Italians although the better environment may boost it a bit (Flynn effect).

        Listening to EMJ as habit, he was talking about Rome needing to conquer to pay debts, later said the UK had to plunder for the same reason iirc. I wonder if that’s the nature of empire, or at least multicultural empire. One big Ponzi scheme.Otoh, I’m sort of fond of a national empire, I guess you’d call it. Like the Roman Republic, the German Empire, the US in its Yankeedom phase, I suppose China and the Russian Federation today. Even the UK, which I guess isn’t technically national, but not far from it. They aren’t perfect, but they seem to be stronger and more stable than other states to me— until they start adventuring abroad. Whether that’s because of ambition or because the Ponzi scheme is already in motion, I’m not sure, but it seems to me the peak is usually in that phase.Sort of OT, but thinking along the lines of peoples, America was mostly Protestant and Germanic at its founding, and I imagine that has a lot to do with disunity and settling for a creed. Famously wild and disunited peoples throughout most of history (Protestantism being exemplary of that imo), Anglos not far removed from the piratical Norman influence. Plus the danger of crossing an ocean in the 17th/18th centuries as a selection pressure. Basically, we got a lot of the stock least-suited to build a nation out of, yet that was the task. And I believe that: I don’t think it was mere ambition or taxation that led to the Revolution.Bumpy ride, but all things considered, we’ve done better than could be expected. Tough spot today, but the job isn’t finished.

            Oof.
England was the first ethnic nation rather than an aristocracy ruling over an inchoate peasantry.You also have the non-trivial matter of 1000 years of Anglo jurisprudence which suggests a damn sight more stability and civilization than those wogs on the continent.
Catholicism leads to unity!? Not really familiar with the history of France,Spain,Italy etc.are you?
Empires don’t necessarily make money for the entire polity;just the elite. The British empire was a net drain on all of the UK but the elite did well out of it. Like slavery and the South.

I’ll take your word for it, but I wouldn’t have figured it. Maybe guessed France, idk lol. I mean, why’d the Angles get the name instead of Britons, Saxons, Normans, etc.?
Not saying Catholicism confers more stability, it’s that I think Protestantism is a Germanic thing, based on who originated and adopted it.
Re: empires, like I said I’m not sure. Are they a net positive until they go international, or do they have an inevitable fate?

                You dare accusing others to not be familiar with History, considering your ridiculous wrtiting (and even more ridiculous pseudo, Bastiat, the maniac liberal, member of the left wing of french parliament).Acting England as “first ethnostate” is on a level such absurd than I barely can argue. A celtic-scandinavian-saxon-french country, ethnically unified. Lol.But the second part, my God!*Anglo jurisprudence which suggests a damn sight more stability and civilization than those wogs on the continent.*Ooh yes, great Anglo *stability * with those 7 (no less) Saxon kingdoms, finally destroyed by Danish, then resurrected, then destroyed again by French from Normandy.French kings then accepting to submit to feudal “magna Carta” aristocracy.Oh, and then a good stable half century of civil war, and then, both sides lost and a random guy take the throne.Then, still stable, his son create a fucking personal CHURCH.And this new anglo-stable dynasty is remplaced by a new one just after a century.And this new dynasty is again not english. After French, Welsh, here came the Scots!Less than 20 years, and the first republican revolution, made by a 17thC style woke coalition of puritans, oligarchs and jews beheaded the StuartStill stable, the Stu are back in town 20 years later.20 years, again, and a new revolution definitively transform kings into crowned puppets, and bar the way to the political right, an unprecedented movement in history, and which triumphs more than ever today.And all that mess without speaking of old celtic Britain, roman Britain, and the no less than four (4) dynasties pupetting in just 3 centuries (house of Nassau, of Hanover, of Saxe, and since 2022, of Oldenburg.).Such stability, compare to 1400 years of french monarchy with just 3 dynasties, then a mess of 80 years then our ugly leftist stronghold of french republic.

            The US has always both suffered and benefited from the selection pressures that chose who came here. Even when immigrants were overwhelmingly White, Christian Europeans there was probably a higher than normal amount of sociopathy among new arrivals. At the same time you need to be fairly smart and courageous to undertake a dangerous sea voyage and this probably gave us our industrious, innovative, and risk taking qualities. I’m pretty sure the same genetics are behind both the bad and the good of all that.Today’s immigrants are different though. It’s trivially easy for most to get here and doing better for yourself than you did in the “old country”, if that country is a third world shithole, is as easy as signing up for EBT and housing assistance. Thus you still get a higher proportion of people looking for a free ride or escaping justice somewhere but without the same drive to succeed by their own wits and efforts.When you combine the pre-existing sociopathic tendencies of a lot of the old immigrant groups, in particular a certain group known for its hats, with the high number of lazy, stupid, and criminal types coming over nowadays, it’s not really a surprise that the “melting pot” is now a pressure cooker in a meth lab.Adding in the rather unexpected rise to global empire after WWII and the presence of nuclear weapons and what you’ve got is something like what might be expected if the Hell’s Angels were to have been given control of a superpower. How does the line from the movie go? “And we wanna get loaded. And we wanna have a good time. And that’s what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna have a good time. We’re gonna have a party!”

        They got Trump, now they’re after Thomas.
You didn’t actually think that they were going to let him get away with overturning Roe and letting you white Christian peckerwoods keep your Second Amendment and your guns… did you?

Be a mighty fine time to have a couple of Supreme Court justices resign so that Biden can replace them while Trump is in prison, wouldn’t it?

            Removing a SC justice works the same as removing a president. Need 2/3 vote to convict in the Senate. Figure the odds. They would need a whole lot more ammo than this. Do they really want to go after him for doing the same things that they all do?

                    Even while Trump was in office they followed the letter of the law in trying to be rid of him. Or at least worked to make it appear as if they were, as they investigated and tried him for made up charges. Which still couldn’t reach that 2/3 threshold.

            Isn’t it theoretically justified? A senate with 57 democrats confirmed him when he replaced liberal hero thurgood marshall, not to mention Thomas was only 43. Why George Mitchell allowed any of his senators to vote for him is beyond me.Meanwhile a senate with 54 republicans wouldn’t even allow for a hearing for garland despite the fact that he wouldn’t be on the court as long (he was 63 years old) and was not as liberal as Scalia was conservative.Because Thomas could serve another 15 years and retire at 90 (similar to John paul stevens) this might be the way to get him off the court. It’s surely better optics than the “basement in Yekaterinburg” method which I’m not sure if the Biden admin has the stomach for

        How does a creedal country re-boot itself when the creed ultimately fails once that country looks like the UN cafeteria?   The only way would be a new creed that unites all 50 states.  That would be a hell of a feat.  You can’t just spin a new creed whole-cloth outside of military conquest, it takes generations to indoctrinate.  Like building a Jenga tower to the moon.Looking at history you see various resolutions.  New borders drawn, outright conquest by an external power (I don’t see that one on the menu) or some strong man that unites through sheer force of will (not only un-American but no one even 1% capable of doing that).  We don’t have a “generalissimo” culture.  The most “American” solution is to just walk away from an unfinished DIY project that went really bad, leave the unevenly poured cement slab and stack of particle boards to get covered over by leaves and have a cold one.  Everyone just going their own direction.  The neo-cons and corporate overlords who rule us would sooner have blue helmets running around the country murdering everyone than have that happen.

                    The creed hasn’t failed yet though.  Sure it failed intellectually, spiritually, etc., but it hasn’t yet failed materially, not with the fat-f uks in new $1000 per month 7 year payoff vehicles I’m seeing.   We’re not there yet.  And being one of the most materialist places on Earth, that’s what matters.   Blue haired HR women being laid off.  Not quite.

                        Regarding what The Wild Geese Howard said below I’d say that the unique thing about the US today is that, due to it’s status as global empire, it can afford to keep the blue haired nomenclatura in Teslas and hair dye. This is what really keeps factory workers in southern China laboring away to make that stuff for them. If the US lost its GAE status those people would need to come up with answers to the question everyone outside the Imperial Citadel has to answer: what can you actually do that’s useful to us?Since the answer to that for a large segment of the younger people here is “not much”, I would expect things to get rather dire for a lot of people. One big tell that the Empire is faltering will be a lot of blue haired prostitutes suddenly appearing. I can imagine them lining up in front of Starbucks since that’s probably the place most of them think of as popular. I’ll leave it to you guys to supply the soy latte jokes.

                We have a consumer culture. AINO residents judge themselves and each other by what they consume, rather than by what they produce. By where they shop, and for what. By what kind of car they drive. By the music they listen to. These are the markers of status.

        Learning from mistakes requires acknowledging mistakes, no? Is the ruling class even capable of such? Of course not. Hence the old order, which they control completely, is melting down because it cannot be adjusted and maintained; it is quite rich that those who embrace post-modernism and seek constant struggle require stasis to maintain it (always the case), and that has become impossible in no small part due to their turning the table over.Puritans were the original virus within the United States and they remain so today, seamlessly transitioning from witch burnings to child sexual mutilation ideology. That people ignore them let alone see them rightly as quite insane only fuels their drive for control and subservience. Lincoln was their first Napoleon, and his pathetic successor is AOC. I don’t see much marching left with her at the head of the formation. Two years would be less of a surprise than ten.A French monarchist who comments here frequently, Parasan, rightly claims the USA was the first fully leftwing state and his country’s madness in its wake was simply a continuation of Lexington and Concorde. The United States’ equivalent of the Paris commune, excepting perhaps the Civil War, just arrived more slowly. The Puritans, now armed ti the teeth with nukes, are running a last ditch Committee on Public Safety. What possibly could go wrong?History is littered with the graves of people who made mistakes and died fully convinced they were correct.

            History is the grave — right or wrong, we all return there. I never understood the intense dislike of the Puritans. Yes, I know the City upon the Hill concept. Yes, I understand the fanaticism. Yes, I understand the everyone watching everyone.But – here is the caveat – the Puritans consciously removed themselves from corrupt society by building an alternate moral code. The vigilantly kept out outsiders; they watched for corruption within their ranks; and they refused to compromise their morality (except when they did).Of course, the vague label of Puritan makes impossible ascribing a particular belief or action to the whole group. Sure, people may attack Cromwell, but consider the situation he inherited. The corruption of the heart of society, the Church (be it Catholic or Anglican) needed a strident response.The Salem Puritans made mistakes, yes. But they also lived a tough life, on the outskirts of town (consciously removing themselves), and worked their butts off to improve their material and moral circumstances. Of course, after they achieved it, we had the trials. But the initial thrust, hard times and hardy people, are worthy of respect.The deviance from Puritanical tenets, such as they may be,  helps explain some of the issues. The child-mutilators no longer seek to separate themselves; they now want to impose their model on everyone. The communes that were in vogue in the 60s and 70s is a better model for traditional Puritanism in American.Now, the other problem is we, on the dissident side, do not have the virulent conviction to further our goals as effectively as the Puritans do. Say what you will: the Puritans got results. They greatly expanded their wealth; they were the most literate in the world; and their influence shaped America and England. If we had their alacrity, things would be different (or at least the Northwest Movement would be further along!).

                No, Cromwell and his Roundheads were cultural wreckers, murdering hounds, and genocidal loons (just ask the Irish, they’ll tell you). There are good reasons that the English dug up his remains, put them in a cage, and hung them up to be reviled after their preferred system of rule was restored.Their successors here were cut from the same cloth; fanatical, self-congratulatory, and tight-assed hypocrites, and were not to be admired. During the War of Northern Aggression they ran true to form, wrecking the economic wherewithal of the South, killing huge swathes of their best men, and genocidal loons in the broader sense of the word in suppressing and insofar as possible wrecking the cultures of the South with their highly focused, and malevolently intended fanaticism. Unfortunately, their successors, now harnessed to the service of spiteful mutant immigrant groups and insane idelogies, are still working their abominations.

                    “Preferred system of rules” is subjective – the Jacobean line was not exactly popular. Two, the English Civil War was the result of poor rulers, not external agitation. Cromwell rose to promise as a leader in an already existing conflict. Three, I drew a distinction between American isolationist Puritans and English. Four, the Puritans are gone – not present tense. Five, the world would probably be a bit better if we had the Puritans applying their morality to the world.

                        I think of the Puritan impulse as being akin to a mind virus; capable of mutation over the span of time, and owing to the press of material/cultural conditions, yet ever capable of a resurgence of its foundational narcissistic fanaticism. Wreckers unwilling to live and let live, and constitutionally incapable of doing so. Like an actual biological virus, totally focused on the propagation of itself, albeit accomplished in this mission. But I don’t admire viruses for their proficiency. Tough shit for everybody else, as that mind virus presents as a sociopathic monoculture.

                To echo JJ, they didn’t stay isolated, though, and were key players in the British civil war. The English had the good sense to get rid of them. They festered here until they felt safe enough to venture outside their cult and have done tremendous damage since. Yes, they have the capacity for great achievement but also a psychotic impulse even worse than members of the Tribe. What they are doing now is what they always have done.

                    So what are we doing here? Just here to spit in the wind? Puritans no longer exist, again, and their efficacy is worthy of respect, again. What change has the dissident movement accomplished? Were the Puritans not dissidents? They ruled over a country – we post on comment sections. And I will say again: the Puritans no longer exist. The fact that many associate the zealotry of Puritans with trannies is akin to equating the nationlism of the Spartans to the Italians.

        I don’t think the cause of the Civil War is properly understood by most people.  The mainstream view is that the war was over slavery and the minority view from the right is that it was over state vs. federal rights and slavery was an excuse.  IMO, that still doesn’t get to the heart of the issue.  Let me explain…Jewish money-lenders were happy to fund both sides in European wars (like Nathan Rothschild funding all the belligerents, England, Prussia, and France, at Waterloo, with France receiving a loan of 10 million pounds), but they also funded both sides of the U.S. Civil War (the North through their American agent August Belmont and the South through the Erlangers, Rothschild relatives).In “The Rothschilds, the Financial Rulers of Nations,” John Reeves noted that when the family met in London in 1857 for a wedding, Prime Minister of England Benjamin Disraeli declared: “Under this roof are the heads of the family of Rothschild – a name famous in every capital of Europe and every division of the globe.  If you like, we shall divide the United States into two parts, one for you, James, and one for you, Lionel.  Napoleon will do exactly and all that I shall advise him.”  Otto Von Bismark stated in 1867: “The division of the United States into two federations of equal force was decided long before the civil war by the high financial power of Europe. These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained in one block and as one nation, would attain economical and financial independence, which would upset their financial domination over the world. The voice of the Rothschilds predominated. They foresaw the tremendous booty if they could substitute two feeble democracies, indebted to the financiers, to the vigorous Republic, confident and self-providing. Therefore they started their emissaries in order to exploit the question of slavery and thus dig an abyss between the two parts of the Republic.”Rothschild family biographer Niall Ferguson notes a “substantial and unexplained gap” in private Rothschild correspondence between 1854-1860.  He says all copies of outgoing letters written by the London Rothschilds during this Civil War period “were destroyed at the orders of successive partners”.Re: the Roman conquest of the Levant, Zman writes: “The great failure of the old religion ways gave birth to a new form of Judaism.”  He is correct on this point; during Jesus’s day there was wide disagreement among the Jews over the Oral Law; the Karaites rejected it entirely and the Saudducees partially rejected it.  After the destruction of the Second Temple the Oral Law proponent Pharisees won out and codified the Oral Law in the Talmud, which is vicious in its portrayal of gentiles.Interestingly, when the Nazis invaded Russia they took over a 70,000 Karaite Jewish population in Crimea, and they left them alone because they didn’t consider them a threat (because they only believed in the Torah and not the Talmud):https://jewishcurrents.org/january-512-karaites-and-the-nazis

            For the unbelievers out there, this is going to seem Sunday school, but bear with me. As you will see in the end, my intentions are not religious but trying to clarify the relationship between Jews and Western people.“After the destruction of the Second Temple the Oral Law proponent Pharisees won out and codified the Oral Law in the Talmud, which is vicious in its portrayal of gentiles.”Right. The Old Testament religion was centered on the Temple. According to the Old Testament, God made a pact (covenant) with Moses so the sins could be forgiven by sacrificing animals in the Temple, as an offer to God. The Old Testament is full of this. Many of the laws of the Old Testament are focused on the Temple and how you have to abandon the local high altars and sacrifice in the Temple. It was about centralization.Then, the Pharisees developed some new traditions (a tradition is a doctrine that is transmitted by oral teaching and not by writing). These traditions were later called the Oral Law, were not in the Old Testament and were not accepted by everyone. There were different degrees of disagreement with these traditions.Jesus attacked these traditions (Mark 7, 1-13) and said that He was going to replace the Temple by his body as a way of forgiving sins (John 2, 18-22). Christians believe that the sacrifice of Jesus forgives the sins (Matthew 26, 27-29): it is a new covenant (“new testament”) that replaces the old covenant of Moses.In short, Jesus makes obsolete the Temple as a way of forgiving sins. The Temple is not needed anymore by his followers. Saint Paul confirms in Hebrews 9:11-15This is important because the Temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70AD. So the Old Testament religion was not possible anymore. The Christians already had their solution. But, what about the Israelites that didn’t want to become Christians?Karen Amstrong explains in “The Case for God”:Rabbi Yohanan had absorbed this lesson. Shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem, when he and his companions had occasion to walk past the ruined temple buildings,Rabbi Joshua had been unable to contain his grief: “Woe is it that the place, where the sins of Israel find atonement, is laid waste.”But Rabbi Yohanan replied calmly, “Grievenot, we have an atonement equal to the Temple, the doing of loving deeds, as it is said, ‘I desire love and not sacrifice.’ “[…].After the fall of the city, a community of scribes, priests, and Pharisees gathered there and, under the leadership of Yohanan and his pupils Eliezer and Joshua, began the heroic task of transforming Judaism from a temple faith to a religion of the book. The Torah would replace the Holy of Holies, and the study of scripture would substitute for animal sacrifice. […] ”The Israelites that didn’t want to become Christians simply invented another religion. A religion not centered on the Temple (which was gone) but centered on studying the traditions and deriving laws from them. They wrote the traditions on the Talmud in the first centuries of the Christian era and then spent the following centuries, deriving laws from the interpretation of the Talmud, and then using these interpretations to derive new laws, and then using these new interpretations to derive new laws, and so on and so forth.As with Christians, the Old Testament is read because of devout reasons (the poetry of the Psalms is magnificent for , but it is not followed as a law you have to adhere to. You cannot follow the Old Testament because you don’t have a Temple. Christians replaced the Old Testament with the teachings of Jesus. Jews replaced it with the Oral Law (Talmud) and all the interpretations derived from it.In short, we have three religions. The Old Testament religion, which was followed in times of Jesus. Christianity, founded about 30AD. And Judaism (Talmudism) which was founded about the second century, which is the youngest religion of all three. Christianity and Judaism come from Old Testament religion. There were prophecies in the Old Testament about a new religion arising in the future (and Jesus confirms in the New Testament). Christians think that it applies to them and Jews think that it applies to them.This is important because you see the sentence “Jesus was a Jew!” all the time, because people conflate Judaism with Old Testament religion. This is not even wrong. Jesus was a Israelite, he followed the Old Testament religion (but founded Christianity). As anybody who reads the Gospels can see, he was the archenemy of the Pharisees, the intellectual ancestors of the Jews. He despised the Oral Law, which is the basis of Judaism. Saying that Jesus was a Jew is like saying Stalin was capitalist.This is important because this has made the relationship between Western people (whose traditional religion is Christianity) and Jews completely insane. When Christians see Jews, they imagine that they are seeing Biblical characters, the People of God, the Chosen People (but the New Testament says that the Church is the People of God, the New Israel). This has a lot of implications but I won’t explain them, because I know that you are seeing them.

                Yep…  modern day “jews” are as authentically jewish in a theological sense as the black hebrew israelites are.“Rabbinicism” or “talmudism” would be more descriptive of so called modern day “judaism”.  At LEAST this religion should be referred to as “RABBINIC judaism” or “TALMUDIC judaism”.Educated Christians should be quite clear on this explicitly per Rev 2:‘I know your suffering and your poverty (but you are rich), and how you are blasphemed and slandered by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan [they are Jews only by blood, and do not believe and truly honor the God whom they claim to worship].”I know its a surprise that these people might use a semantic trick to confuse us and use our sympathies for their own advantage… but just contemplate that possibility.

                Thank you for this lucid exposition.But, if I am not mistaken, these weren’t the only occasion that the old switcheroo was used among the Israelites. I recall (sorry, no scriptural passage citation) a time when a faction within the priesthood – surprise, surprise – discovered some scrolls in a walled up cavity detailing a whole new set of teachings, which purported to claim that for some little period of time, the rules under which they had been operating were to be superceded by the discovery of these more authentic teachings.Uh huh, okee dokee. So the reenvisagement of the religion after the destruction of the temple ain’t no new thing, but rather a more recent example of same.

            The pertinent piece of the puzzle, missing from the discussion so far [as I can see], is that THE J00Z owned the entirety of the trans-Atlantic chattel slave trade.Once the sephardim in Holland sent the first african chattel slaves to Jamestown in 1619, the tidewater settlers had two choices:1) Continue to attempt to farm the malaria-riddled tidewater with paid White labor which was susceptible to malaria, or2) Switch to farming with unpaid african chattel slave labor which had a sickle cell gene that made the chattel slaves largely immune to malaria.Immediately upon the j00ish introduction of malaria-immune unpaid labor to the New World, all it took was one White plantation owner to cheat, and use African slave labor, and thereby drive all of his White competitors into bankruptcy.Ergo all of the White plantation owners were forced to cheat, and use African slave labor, simply to keep their financial heads above the water and not drown [i.e. go bankrupt].Welcome to the abject bio-sociological nihilism which is known as, “Free Markets”.

                Just a small nit to pick, but the sickle cell gene is not nearly as prevalent in blacks as you infer. It does give great resistance to malaria, but comes with its own set of very debilitating issues. However, most all West African blacks are Duffy-negative (a lesser known, but important blood group), which gives great resistance to Plasmodium vivax. While not quite as deadly as P. falciparum, P. vivax is the most well-distributed malaria species.

        China has had a very long time to reflect on its failures. They have learned some very valuable lessons, especially from the opium trade.I have alot of respect for the CCP, despite recognizing them as enemies.Russia didn’t have a long stretch of humiliation, but had quite a “spicy” 20th century. A catastrophic first half, and disastrous last decade. They also had some great victories, at great cost. No doubt intelligent Russians have learned quite a bit from this important century.The rise of a “multipolar” world will ironically be the best thing for our people, who no longer have much say in our own countries. Russia, Belarus, maybe Serbia and Hungary, and Latin America are probably the only places still run by our people.Our elites have learned nothing and forgotten nothing, and are going insane/destructive. Bad elites are very bad for everyone.

            I would argue that Russia has been humiliated longer than China. Maybe more than most countries. When you’re a giant flat country at the meeting point of steppe tribes, Vikings, religious zealots, army generals, diverse peasant peoples, Communists, and certain stone age tribes with ferocious grudges, you’re going to get humiliated.
China thanks their good fortune that they’ve been walled off from Asia for most of their existence.

        The real irony is in creedalism’s ascendancy being simultaneous to the disregarding of the creed, the words on the paper no longer being followed or applicable. The authors of the creed being vilified at the very same time that those touting the creed disregard the creed. Yet the creed is still purported to be the emperor’s clothes. Clown world indeed.One gets the sense that Russia and China have learned a lot from failure. One also gets the sense that China looks forward to a humiliation of the GAE that may not require much direct effort on its own part. The GAE already sold the rope to China with which it will be hanged.Speaking of the GAE’s lack of industrial capacity, I saw a remark the other day that stories of the GAE’s lack of ammunition for the war is misinformation meant to be believed by its adversaries. I wouldn’t know. I kind of doubt it. But it’s something to think about.

            “ Russia and China have learned a lot from failure.”
Not just their failures—which Z-man alludes to—but to ours.  For example, China allows no ethnic/religious dissent.  This is why they repress the Uyghurs and appoint “Christian” leadership.  They have seen what a fifth column such “diversity” leads to.  You also, as a non-ethnic resident, can achieve no citizenship—either through residence or marriage.  Marriage outside the race is discriminated against.

                I read years ago that China undertook a policy to ensure that women were no more than 15% of Party members, and that there was a campaign underway (an inquisition, if you will) to ensure that none of them were globohomo-style feminists.Smart people learn from their own failures. Very smart people can learn from other people’s failures. Clearly, at least some Chinese are very smart. About the same time I read that, I read of a Chinese mass deportation operation (~50k) expelling illegal alien Africans.” It was a good start, but if the effort has been continued, I haven’t seen anything on it.

                    It was here I learned the Red Guards were not Mao’s creation, but his wife’s.  (He was busy summoning three or four star-struck peasant girls to his bed at night, as befits a Chinese emperor.)
They learned the Hard HR lesson quickly, didn’t they?  Just put your foot down and say no, you can’t come in or take a seat.

        Slavery in the old south was an unmitigated disaster for white who didn’t own land. my ancestors lived in the mountains of NC and Virginia before the french and Indian wars, much less the revolution. Slavery was a cost savings over paying a living wage to the landless whites living in the area. so they were often squeezed out to the furthest reaches of the frontier. They couldn’t get work so subsistence farming on the edges was all that was left to many of them. these poor mountian men  composed most of Rogers rangers that won the Northwest territories of ohio,indiana,ill., Wisc. and mich in the revolutionary war.  slavery was a great betrayal to them . .

            Slavery was an unmitigated disaster for slaveholders too. It made them responsible for a mass of people who weren’t able to adapt to Western life. It stifled mechanical innovation and left the South behind the rest of the country in development. It was an horrible institution that has led to so much grief for us as a people.

                In addition to the j00z controlling the trans-Atlantic chattel slave trade, it was almost solely YANKEE new england shipping magnates which signed the contracts with the j00z to move the kneegr0ws across the Atlantic [search on “Triangular Trade”].
The average White southroner [a starvation-level dirtfarmer with little more than a jug of moonshine to his name] was largely left scratching his head, and wondering, “WTF is happening?”
tl;dr == j00z &amp; YANKEES were responsible for all of this.
The average White Southroner was an utterly innocent bystander.

            Morally of course, slavery is abhorrent. Aside from the moral question though, there are very serious deleterious effects that slavery has on all societies, one of the biggest of which you have described here… it sets a ceiling on the price of basic labor in your society at the same level as the cost of feeding/clothing a slave. Obviously this is insufficient for a free person so the free people suffer along with the unfree.A similar thing contributed to the fall of the Roman republic. Success in wars led to large conquests and lots of slaves. These slaves eventually caused the economic ruin of small holder Roman citizens who were forced to move into the city of Rome itself and get on the bread dole. The sons and grandsons of those Romans formed the Marian legions which were the prototype for Caesar’s legions that eventually crossed the Rubicon.One of my favorite latin proverbs from this time is as follows:“Flet victus. Victor interiit.”Translation: “The conquered mourns. The conqueror is undone.”I think this applies as much today as it did back then.

                And let’s not forget the pernicious role imperialism plays in all of this. Yes, until the 19th century, conquest produced slaves, but in the process it also proved to be an exponent of diversity. And unlike slavery, diversity has proved an ineluctable result of imperialism right up to the present.
Blaise Pascal said something to the effect that all of man’s problems can be traced to his inability to sit quietly in a room. One can scale that observation up to the polity level, as well.

            I’ve often joked of my Confederate ancestors that originally I respected them and their service, and as things have played out, I’m just now pissed at them for losing. A little insight into what would have happened if they had prevailed happened in the immediate aftermath of the war. The Southern lower and middle classes wanted blacks exiled, and the old aristocracy wanted them to stay put and continue to work. The occupation army made sure the latter happened, and that was even before the 14th Amendment. This was just a glimpse at the class struggle that would have happened.

        Pretending different races, even if they’re intra-continental, are the same and can coexist together doomed this country from the start. It was always going to end with one side subjugating the other or breaking apart. The north was full of proto shitlibs during the colonial days, it wasn’t foisted on them, they were always going to go full retard. The kosher nosetra ruling class we have now wouldn’t have been possible without the wannabe israelites taking control of the country, they had a shared interest even if they had different motivations. It concerns me that people continue to claim we’re all the same race with the implication we’re all blank slates. The 80/20 rule doesn’t just apply to non whites and different european ethnic groups have their own racial averages when it comes to politics. As long as that’s denied this same outcome will happen all over again if we ever break apart.

            The proto-SJW existed in America long before the revolutionary war.  I was reading an early 20th century book called “The Philadelphia Negro” and the stories printed in that book from the 17th century were near identical to what goes on today.  The Quakers were the Jews of that time. Always trying to improve the “Negro” with their stupid programs.I agree though that having all the different ethnic groups in America doomed it from the start. Swedes may be White, but they aren’t English.  Same with Italians etc. People understood this well into the 20th century.All of us, born after the war have never known anything different than “all White people are all Americans”  This is why all of Europe doesn’t look the same or function the same.

                I’m gonna have to check that book out, I’ve read a smattering of different stories about New Englanders doing things that, like you said, are identical to what’s happening today. There’s a few articles on Counter Currents from years ago about these types doing things like inviting natives into their villages thinking the power of Christ has somehow overridden their savagery with a predictably bloody outcome. Wish I could tell you what the articles were named, I swore I had them bookmarked but apparently I never did. They’d likely be tagged under ‘american indians’ given the subject matter but having just looked, there’s a lot more articles tagged with that than I could’ve ever anticipated. Seems the tag is now polluted with articles about White women larping as natives, they really ought to separate those since they’re really not the same subject matter.The quakers have more than a few similarities with jews so it’s not surprising they go together like peanut butter and jelly, there’s apparently apparently a fair amount of common genes between them too. That’s an angle of this I’m really starting to dig into now. One big difference between people like the quakers and jews is the latter subverts for material gain whereas shitlibs seem to do it as an act of religious piety. Knowing what I know now I can’t help but view the civil war and everything that’s followed as an implicit holy race war against ‘evil’ Whites. There’s more to it than that, obviously, but that was and is clearly the underlying thought process driving them to do these things.If any non european group behaved the way white leftists do with calling ‘evil’ Whites racial epithets and relishing shoving progressivism down their throats it would be understood that it was racially motivated animosity. Somehow them being european flips a switch in some people’s brains that they’re just misled, there’s a shocking amount of people who should know better by now. There’s an unhealthy obsession with unity, I don’t know what else to call it, they act the same way conservatives do about based blacks. I’ve been noticing it more and more as of late why I’ve been going out of my way to push back on it, I’m usually just a lurker.

                Tars Tarkas: “The Quakers were the Jews of that time.”
To this day, the quakers and the j00z are largely inseparable, more or less wed at the hip [we have an yuge quaker population around here, and many of the quaker girls miscegenate with the j00z and bear j00-quaker mischling abominations].
Back in the day, it was a quaker traitor who informed the (((Ochs))) family that the NY Times could be purchased for pennies on the dollar in the aftermath of the 1893 depression.

                    Quakers are not Christians, any more than are Unitarians.
Due to persecution in Britain, they had to invent a parallel society. Excluded from the universities, and many occupations, they found their way as leaders in industrialization, accepting the stink of being “in trade”, but winding up often, as a community, being quite well off. The parallels with Jevvs are striking, and likely these societal circumstances threw them together, in Britain at least.The later surge of eastern European-origin Jevvs is, of course, a different story, but earlier times had habituated the Quakers to the acceptance of their presence.

                        JerseyJeffersonian: ‘accepting the stink of being “in trade”’Quakers are arguably every bit as shekel-mongering as are the j00z themselves.The first [and maybe even the only] time in my life that something was  stolen from our house was when we invited some quaker kids over to play.The older quaker brother stole some old coins from our coin collection.The younger brother went on to become a minor actor in hollyweird.And the most recent time a person gave me the Death Stare was a few years ago, when I saw a quaker woman of my acquaintance, who thought that I had cheated her in a real estate deal [I had not].She literally was prepared to kill me.I got a similar Death Stare a few years earlier, when I visited some American Revolutionary War [KIA] graves which were in a quaker church’s graveyard.Almost a quarter of a MILLENNIUM later and they STILL loathe &amp; despise the Continental Army for having fought for our freedom in the 18th Century.Wicked, wicked, evil satanic creatures are the quakers.All hidden beneath a facade of utterly sanctimonious piety.

        “Jews are currently celebrating Passover, commemorating a foundational event for their people”Yep. The central religious holiday of Judaism celebrates the “foundational event” of their god murdering the innocent firstborn sons of the Egyptian goyim.Speaking of which, it is interesting that Trump was indicted during Holy Week. Like Christ riding into Jerusalem to the accolades of the people, Trump rode into Washington as a populist. Just as Christ called out the corrupt Pharisees as a pit of “vipers” and “hypocrites,” Trump called out Hillary as “crooked” and the media as “fake news.” Just as Christ was betrayed by his close associate Judas Iscariot, Christ was betrayed by his lawyer Cohen. Both Christ and Trump kept company with prostitutes. And just as Christ was indicted by Pilate on obviously bogus charges after asking “What hath he done?” Trump was indicted on misdemeanors elevated to felonies by a DA who routinely dismisses violent felonies committed by black thugs.Now, I am not blaspheming and saying that Trump is a latter-day Christ. Far from it (although plenty of people mistakenly thought he would be the “savior” of America and could “make it great again”).What I am saying is that the story of Christ getting railroaded and tortured to death for challenging the hypocrites and liars in power is an enduring story that gives us insight into the true wickedness of human nature. In all times and places and eras, this story gets repeated over and over.

            “The central religious holiday of Judaism celebrates the “foundational event” of their god murdering the innocent firstborn sons of the Egyptian goyim.”
Which, like every other of their claims, is a lie. There’s a reason the “Dead Sea Scrolls” were classified.
Ron Unz looks at the degree of bullshit on his site.

                We call them foundation myths for a reason. There is no evidence in support of the exodus story. There is evidence of various people migrating out of Egypt, so most likely these stories were borrowed and enhanced over time. The flood story is another example. It is likely that Jews borrowed the idea of the creator deity from Zoroastrianism.
In the show tomorrow I will spend some time on the Germanification of Christianity. This is just the nature of religions. They evolve and adapt, while maintaining a core set of tenets. Otherwise, they die out.

                    Joseph Campbell in his book, “The Power of Myth” touches upon this.  The salient point being that the truth (or falsity) of the myth is not important.  It is what the myth “tells” us of what the society *aspires* to.For example, George Washington as a child chopping down his father’s cherry tree and confessing such when questioned.  Pure BS, but an enduring tale told to illustrate/inculcate the virtue of honesty and acceptance even of consequences.  Now there was a country/society in ascendency.Today, our latest “myth” is that a man can be a women simply by affirmation (and all that entails).  Now there is a country/society in decline.

                    When I was a kid, around 1980, there was a big TV documentary series, PBS or BBC or Canadian equivalent, purporting to tell the entire history of the Jews. The first episode began with what was then considered the first archeological proof of historical Jewish existence, an old Egyptian graffiti/inscription (I don’t remember which) noting in stone that at long last the locals had freed themselves of the criminal Jews. I assume that’s been discredited, as archeology typically generationally is, but: that was the story.Looking back, the ’70s seems to be when the diaspora creation myth was shifted from Exodus to Shoah, not least by casting *everyone who ever lived* as present-day antisemites. The archetypal Jewish mobster still existed in Americans’ minds circa 1980, so it had to have existed in the Egyptian mind. Now it doesn’t anymore.

                “Which, like every other of their claims, is a lie.”
But it’s not a lie that they celebrate it. Nor is it a lie that they celebrate massacring Haman, his ten sons, and “75,000 enemies of the Jews” on Purim.
Even if these are myths, the fact that they celebrate them tells us something about who they are.

They were asked nice first, but that punk pharaoh and his gelded advisors wanted to show how Empowered they were, with their vile pagan ‘religion’ and their bogus ‘gods’.  Got all stubborn and nasty about it.
P.S. that was MY GOD that whacked them and I would back Him up 100 percent if He said do it again.  You know neither my Father nor Christ the King.

        It has be joked (morbidly) that if/when the US falls and the Great Depression 4.0 kicks in, the mass exodus of paperwork Americans would occur. I’m not too sure about that seeing how the sense of entitlement has set in at this point. They may not love the soil or have roots at bind, yet even a trickle of government cheese may suffice to keep them here.

                The main problem with Puerto Rico is that it’s full of Puerto Ricans. Chicago, or anywhere in AINO, is still a very long way from that, regardless of who is in the mayor’s office.

                    Correct.  A while back, I read that they still didn’t have full utilities back on line after the last hurricane some several years prior.  Puerto Rico is a nice country wrt climate and beaches and such tourist attractions, but as said, “it’s full Puerto Rican’s.I suspect Chicago and New York have mostly economic migrants in them who have little hope of a good job back home.  Also, PR’s can come and go as they like, so I suspect many make their bones here and “retire” back home.This is an old story wrt PR.  Hell, there’s a great 1960 musical about exactly such, “West Side Story”.  One of the hit songs was concerning economic advancement in this country as verses back home—“America”.  You can Google and listen to it.

            It’s pretty hard to say what will happen because it’s impossible to tell just how much of the problems of Puerto Rico or Latin American countries are caused by the meddling of the federal government. If federal spending subsides, and with it foreign meddling, it’s fairly probable that paper Americans would move back. If the feds can keep meddling, then who knows?

        In his book ‘Anti-Fragile’, Nassim Talib makes that same point: that the lessons learned from failure often make a person, or a system, stronger and less fragile.As far as the Jews flight from Egypt, as described in the Old Testament, there’s no indication that that really happened. It’s almost certainly a made up story.If the entire Egyptian army— armored men carrying swords, horses drawing iron-wheeled chariots— was swallowed up in the Red Sea, as the Scriptures recount, *that would certainly have left a trace*If a Hebrew (Joseph) had become second-in-command of all of Egypt, second only to the Pharaoh, and saved the country from a seven-year famine— in a time in which Egypt honored prominent man by erecting carved stylae and temples and pyramids in their honor— that extraordinary story would surely have been noted by someone. But no monument to Joseph exists, and no historian mentions him.If millions of Hebrews (the Bible records it as “600,000 men, plus women and children”; so at least a few million)— wandered around a relatively-small area of desert, *that surely would’ve left a trace*. But no one has ever found any.Likewise, if the Hebrews, on entering the ‘promised land’, completely destroyed several cities, as the Bible recounts, there would surely be a trace left of that.That’s why the earliest holy land archaeologists were called “biblical archaeologists”: they set out, Bibles in hand, fully expecting to find evidence of those Old Testament stories. But they found nothing.What is the possibility that all these events could have occurred, but left no trace on the historical or archaeological record?

            Are you implying the Jews greatly exaggerated their victimhood in order to cover for their vicious disloyalty?  I don’t know where you would get crazy ideas for thinking something likethat.All kidding aside though, it would be tough to make a tale like that out of whole cloth, but one can guess that after a couple centuries of being retold it jut got more and more fantastical.  For instance, it wouldn’t be surprising that maybe there was Jewish foreman overseeing a couple hundred Jewish workers, but time turns the foreman into Pharaoh Jr. and the couple hundred Jews into a metropolis of slaves that built all the wonders in Egypt.

                I suspect it’s like the Iliad.  For years they searched for Troy to no avail.  But later found what they deemed Troy.  But much around it simply does not match Homer’s tale.  Again, one assumes that the myth must be accurate to be important, not so.

                What little mention of the Israelites exists in Egyptian records (and they had a lot of records) suggests that they were a nomadic clan of mercenaries that started pillaging in Lower Egypt and probably were indeed chased off by the Pharaoh into Sinai.Cultures like to produce narcissistic origin stories where they’re the most moral and smart people in the world, and all the other peoples hated them for it and then attacked or enslaved them out of pure resentment towards their greatness.  Even Woke is doing the same thing with the 1619 Project and the equally intellectual We Wuz Kangs and Sheeit.

                    To be fair, the OT usually attributes their defeats and attacks not because they were resented, but because they forsook God.  Many OT stories paint them far from moral – usually shows them to be a bunch of ingrates (accurate).

                Quite so, Anna, it is a true witnessing of the pre-eruption events (the Seven Plagues) and what is likely the largest eruption of the volcanic Thera caldera: the wall of water that smashed into the Israeli delta (and the Egyptian soldiers) was the returning tidal wave caused by that eruption.
Imagine: you are hot on the trail, crossing ground made dry by the retreat of the waters.
You hear a growing roar, and turn…to see a wall of water, twenty stories high, rushing towards you.  The Fist of the God.

        Thinking about old habits and why we’ve always done the things we do reminds me of this old saw…
Young newlywed couple decides to have Thanksgiving over at their house and invite their families. As the turkey is being prepared, the new wife proceeds to cut the ends of the drumsticks off the bird. Husband asks why and she replies “… it’s our family recipe, my Mom always made it this way.” During the meal, the new husband asks his mother-in-law why she did the drumstick thing. She replies “The oven was too small.”

        I am fond of the well-known quote by a famous Frenchman, Talleyrand, who commented on the restoration of the monarchy after the downfall of Napoleon. The aristocrats tried to pick up right where they had left off 25 years earlier by insisting on the renewal of all of their old privileges and power. Talleyrand said, “Bourbons have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.” Here in the USA we are faced with a ruling class which exhibits exactly the same myopic vision of world dominion. Even if you throw them out, they will never admit their mistakes. Never. Power is the only thing they understand, and they are addicted to it.

        Neither elite nor leadership are apt descriptions of the ruling class. They are saying to the founding/heritage stock and the 19th and early 20th century of Europeans who willingly adopted the creed and the American identity, “We do not want you.”I think they say that because they don’t want the nation. It is all of confession through action that a people are the nation. Persecution and enmity are going to get much worse as they say with greater force, “We do not want you.”The sooner a great mass of us gets the message and gets wind of the thought that this just might be a no-fault divorce worth enthusiastically pursuing, the sooner we get on with the new thing. The terms of it, are something that we must be in a position and mood to impose. Possession is 9/10s of the law.Perhaps the physical and mental abuse we are suffering at the hands of the albatross population are a necessary failure to put the rugged back into the individuals who collectively form a people.

        If there is a silver lining in the modern turmoil, it is the stripping away of bad habits from the Right.  Yes, the Right still makes plenty of mistakes, but that is because the Right needs to be completely broken down in order to be rebuilt.  The Right got away with their bad habits for so long because they had the luxury of things being so good in this country.  Those days are a distant memory.  Sometimes I think the catastrophic failures we are seeing today will benefit the Right in the long-term, while being very painful in the short-term.  I say this because the culture in the Right is in a transition period.  What was on the party of Regaen is now the party of Trump.  But who will be next, and what his version of the Right be?

            Politics takes a long time to adjust to the culture it is downstream of, especially conservative politics. Progressive/Democrat politics is going warp speed now, in fact they are probablyin frontof their voters, but Conservative/Republican politics will be sputtering about Reagan and McCain and maybe even Trump for another generation at least.Keep in mind that Trump is considered the furthest fringe for most of the e-GOP. Despite being 75 and basically being a bombastic Reagan with a 5th grade vocabulary. (The Dems by contrast are stocked with Trump types, except they’re bombastic brown lefties with 5th grade vocabularies.)Maybe the d-right adage that “the Conservatives don’t conserve anything” is incorrect. The Conservatives are trying like mad to conserve Reagan/Thatcher. Dissident rightists are traditionalists, which is more rooted; “conservative” is nebulous and can mean anything really. In ten years, Sandy Ocasio will be a conservative as the pendulum hopefully and blessedly swings to our side.

        I’ve often argued this from the other side: We assume that since the Fascists lost the war, Fascism is forever discredited as a political philosophy. So even when you see a nation like China having great success with Fascism — it’s almost textbook “national socialism,” small n, small s — people who should know better try to shoehorn US / China relations into the age old “battle of Capitalism vs. Communism.”In that weirdCastle Wolfensteinworld where Mustache Guy won the war, Stalin gets the Hitler treatment, “Communist” is the all-purpose term of abuse, anyone who wins an argument with a Liberal is called a “Leninist,” and all Germany’s many and manifest faults and failures are explained by huge shelves’ worth of books in every university library explaining that REAL Nazism has never been tried.

            Z keeps insisting that solutions like fascism are not the path forward because they were failed experiments which attempted to solve the problems of capitalism. Or, maybe his focus in on the people who are doing the LARP with the flags and salutes and so on.In any case, I think something like blood-and-soil nationalism or throne-and-altar nationalism are the solutions to spiraling leftism. Both those ideas are very old and successful, in different contexts. To your point, what is China except a fascist state? What is Russia except a Church-State partnership with a monarch?The next thing will be an old thing.

                A question that I sometimes pose on this blog is, “How do we get out of this mess without fascism?”
We can call it a different name if you’d like, but our opponents won’t let us get away with that.

                    Fascism is a Leftist movement because it assumes, as Marx does, that class conflict is inevitable. Against Marx, it argues that class conflict can be channeled, managed, and largely eliminated inside an all-encompassing national state. Instead of the state withering away after the world proletarian revolution, Fascism makes the state permanent — nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.Which sounds horrible, but… Marx was right, you know? Class conflict IS inevitable. For “class” you may substitute “race,” as you choose, but it’s the same thing in the end: incompatible cultures in close proximity will inevitably clash.And there is no peaceful separation possible, because the Revolutionary Vanguard who is driving all the class conflict controls all the institutions. The Ivy Leagues turn out cadres with a ruthless efficiency the Higher Party Schools in Moscow could only dream of. The average teachers’ lounge in the average elementary school would give Lenin one lasting way more than four hours — that’s a true Revolutionary Party, comrade! They have a class consciousness undreamed of by the starriest-eyed Bolsheviks.

                    Just to clarify, when I say “fascism” I mean a state whose highest purpose is the flourishing of a specific people, who share blood, language, and culture.When a corporation wants to outsource or import cheap workers to increase profits, fascism says no.  When a cat lady wants to teach your kids that their heritage is evil, fascism says no.I hope that within a fascist white state there would be maximum personal freedom as long as one didn’t advocate for outsourcing, immigration, or a disparagement of the traditional culture.(The definition of “fascism” as a partnership between government and corporations is retarded at best or an attempt to conceal the real meaning.)

                        Bingo.  However, China seems dangerously veering off course in this endeavor.  One, their “social credit system” is beginning to repress such behaviors that are arbitrarily deemed “bad” or anti-state.  Two, their leadership tenure limitation has been subverted by Xi Jinping.  His successor sooner or later will undoubtedly be considered leader for life.  This will inevitably lead to some crazy raking the seat of power sooner or later.

What I did see was screen shots of Chinese folks smart phones which tracked vaccination record for Covid.  Red screen meaning out of date or unvaccinated, which reduced travel options.  Such a system was proposed in the UK as well, but never adopted.
In this case, the phones showing red screen was also used to keep folk away from the banks during their recent “run”.

She simply wants to replace that heritage with a fictive negro one.Fascism is a partnership between state and corporation, but that is only part of it. That twinned entity also seeks to advance a certain people at the expense of other people. Fascist states also tend to be geopolitically and martially aggressive.Frankly, when I put it all together, I’m left to conclude that AINO is a postmodern fascist state. And when we realize that the canonical postmodern theorists admired the work of Nietzsche, Bataille and Heidegger…well…you don’t really have to spell it out now, do you?

                    “If everything is X, then nothing is X.’The problem here for our opponents is that they’ve declared everything to be fascism. First, it was just defined as being anywhere to the right of Bill Clinton. But now being white is fascism, being male is fascism, being straight is fascism, going to church is fascism, owning a non-EV car is fascism, keeping the genitals you were born with is fascism, being better at math than Shaneequa is fascism, not taking an under-tested vaccine for an overhyped flu is fascism, with many more everyday fascisms hiding under the bed to bedevil us. So the question is: If real, genuine fascism ever does actually show up, how can anyone let people know it? If the language used to describe fascism now applies to everything, how can the real thing be described?If everything is fascism, then nothing is fascism. If everybody is Hitler, then nobody is Hitler.

                Fans of German fascism (online only, natch) get to hide in a dream world carved out by, well,Germans.  When I point out that Franco’s implementation was far more enduring and, alas, performed upon a nation closer to the skills and attitudes of the population we live around they all drop out of the thread.  They all want missile bases on the moon and Jews in the camps, not the never-ending slog of sane, civil governance that a rigid, conservative hierarchy should be there to do.

The main problem with going back to fascism and calling it “fascism” is that you’re basically declaring the National Socialist Retard’s Party as far as normie is concerned.
Chinese fascism works without getting derided as fascism because they don’t play SS dress up or march around with torches.

                    They have military parades, just like the fascists or commies had. They just don’t look exactly like the SS. Why should they?

        Given the regional differences in N. America, the two existing state-level organizations may not survive the coming crises. Nor is that survival desirable if it perpetuates the nations of strangers that we have become, or worse.Creating new nations out of the people we have, and especially their children, may occur as an emergent property that grows out of a response to the current and coming crises. However, it is not a guarantee that the new societies that emerge from the wreckage of N. American polities will be desirable places to live.This is where the role of the elites, or leadership class is critical. Our current leadership class is anything but elite and is increasingly forced to use authoritarian methods to maintain their position.  Their only vision is more of the same, with them in charge.  Any re-ordering of the political arrangements that does not involve elite replacement will likely produce the kind of societies that are not good places to live.The old order is as dead, time to think seriously of what comes next.

            I prefer to distinguish between authoritarian and totalitarian. Augusto Pinochet was authoritarian. He sees the rabble being, well, the rabble and brings the hammer down. American elites, like their Bolshevist and Maoist soulmates, are totalitarian: men can be women, citrus fruit will grow in Siberia, you can print money and buy your own debt with it. As reality encroaches, the totalitarian elite go insane and the regime collapses.The new elite will be authoritarian realists, not ideologues. To borrow a phrase, “Whenever I hear the word ‘ideology’ I release the safety on my Browning.” Two ballyhooed concepts, in particular, must be de-legitimized so we can crawl back out of the abyss: 1)  “In Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek;” and 2) “All men are created equal.”

                Yes.  To the extent that labels matter, the right must embrace the ‘authoritarian’ label, and the authoritarian / totalitarian distinction is the perfect place to start.  Authoritarianism is nothing more than the insistence that rules be obeyed, which is itself the foundation of civilization.   To a first approximation, authoritarianism is the demand that everyone follow the rules, totalitarianism is the demand that everyone think the same thoughts.  The difference is made clear by the current western elite, who don’t gave a damn about literal daylight robbery, but will wreck your life forever for saying bad thoughts out loud.Authority is a good thing.

Exactly. The irony of people who promote PoMo and struggle seeking tstasis is rich. It cannot be done.
