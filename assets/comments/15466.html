        Off topic:  My Mom goaded me into a political conversation and I said that we are at the point where men have to pretend that women can beat men up and she said, “Yes!  You have to believe that!”
I said that the current USA is more repressive than the old Soviet Union and she said, “Yes!” like it’s a good thing.
Many women have a formed an anti-white-male bond as strong as J#ws or non-whites.

Yeah.  It’s getting pretty hairy out there.  It’s moving quick.  Seems like about every 7 months things ratchet up another level.  Women have always felt themselves on the same team.  But now they’re a school.  As in a synched-up school of fish.  And they see us as the big bad sharks.  Imagine if they could beat us up like in the movies.  That would suck.

                The core of this is a result of the fact that women speak about three times as many words a day as men- 20,000 versus 6-7,000.
Men speak primarily about transaction matters: what needs to be done and how to do it.
Women speak primarily about relational matters: Who did, and did not, do what to whom.
That would be us.
For the past thirty years my basic operating principle has been that if you tell one women something, you’ve told them all.

            She doesn’t get that that oppressive system she supports can and will be turned against her in a heart beat.
When you conjure demons in your service. don’t be surprised when it turns on you one day.
Her failure is that of most feminists. They fail to see two steps ahead to understand the longer term consequences of their actions. They think “down with the patriarchy” but don’t think what’s waiting in the wings if they take down Western Civ.

        This is it, Ferryman. My boomer-conservative dad asked me what the hell this alt right business is, so I sent him to your blog. I told him to give it a couple weeks, as opposed to reading one post, getting angry, and storming off. I’ll report back. I know his psychology; if he goes for HBD, he’ll at least understand the rest. But he’s from the civil rights era, so it’s going to be a tall order.

        On Kenyan racism and a purported requirement during the Colonial period that blacks wear visible identification – I would not be surprised if that were true, at least in highly populated areas and in the late Colonial period.  But not because of racism.  From 1952 on the British were facing the bloody Mau Mau uprising which had a large inter-tribal component.   Some tribes looked to the British for protection. Visible ID’s for certified friendlies would be a reasonable anti terrorist measure helpful to both the whites and the friendly blacks.

        Excellent points about Germany. I’ve often thought that Germans have a glorious culture to protect, and they should be encouraged to do so. The AfD have a steep path to climb, but their adversaries are making it much easier for them. There’s nothing like Muhammed raping your daughter to get your attention. As usual, the problem will be grappling with the German educational establishment.

        The primary difference politically, between the US and Europe, and the reason why Europe is “ahead” in the development of the dissident right is that the Winner take all model is pretty much a uniquely American beast. Smaller parties- the Greens of late spring to mind, flourish on the margins in Europe because the system provides them with visibility and  influence. I can’t see that happening in the US short of a complete collapse of the  current Bi-Partisan dictatorship.

            Control of the elections is a power reserved to the states, and certain states allow for popular referendums after filing a number of signatures. So a state like mine (Ohio) could ditch winner-take-all (FPTP) in favor of a German-style proportional system. But it has limits in that we elect two US Senators, and the Governor and other state executives. So minor parties would only exist in the House. British Columbia is going to vote on this soon, because the Greens hold the balance of power.

        When traveling outside of white western countries, people are refreshingly honest and sometimes hilariously open about race.  I’ve seen it in the Middle East, South Asia, and the Caribbean.

            This matches my experience, particularly when I visited Egypt in 2000.Middle class Egyptians told me very plainly that they didn’t understand why Americans, meaning whites, catered to black people. One guy, very matter of factly, stated that blacks were “ABID”- Arabic for servant- created by Allah to serve. He said pandering to them would only bring trouble.Living in NYC I have encountered many recent immigrants from India and China who haven’t yet learned to censor themselves and let loose with refreshingly honest observations about blacks and even Jews.The world outside the bubble of the West is candidly race realist. The power of our media tends to color our perceptions about what the rest of the earth really thinks and feels, but spending any amount of time in Africa or Asia will quickly break the spell.

        I was working with a Singaporean Chinese, who says that each faction in  the ruling party has associated PLA units.  And this makes it difficult to respond militarily to external events, because sending your PLA units out of the country leaves your faction vulnerable to take over.
Xi will be forced out because he misplayed his hand with Trump, badly.  Xi’s ego is threatening everyone’s rice bowl.   Bad news Chinoise, we aren’t coming back.   How many Americans would be very happy to block all Chinese products from being allowed in?

            I’m skeptical about how willing China is to play outside its own backyard. They appear to be doing all the traditional things in order to be a local hegemon, competing with India and Japan and to a lesser degree, Russia. That means competing for resources in Africa, but with a small footprint, and enough naval power to compete in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. They have to be careful, because a serious withdraw by the US means Japan becomes a naval power again. Japan could also become a nuclear power in months, if they choose.I’m also skeptical about the real strength of the Chinese economy. People forget that in the 90’s they reorganized their banks to magically make all the bad debt go away. They learned from Wall Street the old game of taking a sick bank and moving its good assets to a new “good” bank and leaving the bad assets in the “bad” bank. That’s fine when isolating contagion, but China did that system wide. As a result, no one really knows how much bad paper is in the Chinese system. Given her history, it could be massive.

                The Chinese demographic moment peaks in the 2020s, after which population aging will weigh down their economy with increased pension costs. China might also be the last in the epoch of heavy industry driven growth. That’s a major problem, as the Third World is counting on production moving out of China as wages go up. Entire countries like Bangladesh are a sewing machine and little else. So much clothing is produced in the Third World that exports of old clothes from the First World is a significant business.

                I’m no expert in these affairs, but somehow I have a sneaky feeling we’re going to see a big shift among the major powers from financialized value back to real, hard-assets value.  The whole pretend-game of the financialized system could be cancelled by sheer pronunciamento overnight, and China would still be sitting on the expanse of real estate that is the Chinese Empire; Russia would still be Russia; it is unclear at this point how much of the so-called United States is still actually America.The Sung Dynasty were my kind of realists.  They understood that they had lost a swathe of turf under what had been the T’ang, so they accepted it, bided their time, produced some pretty great culture, then got the rest of the Empire back centuries later (then lost it again, then got it back again, then lost it again, etc.). Patient men.The United  States may have to write off something like 30 per cent of its nominal present-day territory in order to remain “America.”  Who cares about the petrodollar if you can somehow manage to hang on to Nebraska and the Adirondacks?  I’d rather have a tangible ranch in Idaho that I knew my great-grandchildren would be actually living on, than a pile of funny-looking green pieces of paper whose value is determined by Goldman Sachs and a gaggle of Saudi princes.

            The big Chinese question is how angry will the new middle class get when things don’t go as promised, and how brutal and effective will the crackdown be?  A gigantic version of a North Korea is not off the table.  The authorities have already been moving in that direction in the western provinces.

        Re: the AfD and the German right: some years back I was listening to Opie and Anthony and the comedian Patton Oswalt (of all people) said that the Occupy kids should take a page from the book of the Tea Partiers and at least show up to demonstrations looking like people who had to take off work to protest (and hence paid taxes) rather than costumed revelers at Mardi Gras (this is of course excepting the guys in the tricorner hats larping as Ben Franklin during Tea Party events). Google “Alice Weidel” if you haven’t seen her before. That’s what normie conservatives are trying to project onto someone like Palin or even worse, a Nikki Haley. And it’s something we don’t have yet in America, that I know of. I cringed when I saw that fat Heimbach kid walking around in his Sergeant Schultz helmet, and knew the people following him were doomed.

        China is a dead man walking. 15 of the world’s 20 dirtiest cities are in China. 80% of the water that comes out of the tap is unpottable. Because traditional Chinese families value males over females and practice female infanticide, two generations of men will grow up with no mates possible. And of course, their debt bomb is going to go off with gigatons more impact than ours. They have entirely uninhabited ghost cities. What the world looks like when they implode is anyone’s guess.

        There has always been a powerful strain of populism in Canada. What are referred to as the “Laurentian Elites”, also known as “Central Canada” or “The East” have traditionally treated the west as a resource colony to be exploited for the benefit of Toronto and Montreal, and this had bred resentment and resistance.I have always thought that social credit ideas which were once popular in the western provinces could provide an interesting alternative for those of us who oppose the current liberal capitalist order but don’t like socialism.People need to study how the Canadian Reform Party rose from nothing, and then systematically destroyed the established Progressive Conservative party. It did it without any institutional support or large donors and in the face of unrelenting hostility from the establishment.

            Alberta is the most US-like province, regarded as fundamentalist rednecks until the days of the oil boom brought in a surge from the decaying Maritimes and Asia. The conditions that created the Reform Party are fairly local, as their leader was a scion of a prominent AB Premier. The problem with Reform was its pro-American, rather than Pro-Commonwealth orientation. The old PC party later completed a reverse takeover of Reform.

                    All dissident parties suffer from the same maladies. Mainstream parties attract conformists, but dissident parties attract those with a few screws loose. And non-conforming types tend to loathe the discipline needed to gain power. And there is always either a journalist or a police/intelligence informant ready to open the fissures within the organization. Herding cats…indeed.

            If you haven’t seen it, watch the film ‘Empire of Dust’ from 2011. It’s about Chinese engineers rebuilding neglected colonial-era infrastructure in Congo, and their exasperation with the locals. It’s pretty funny, given that we whites are out of all that.

                I’ll have to watch that maybe.  I skipped around. Check out the part from 33:00 to 34:45.  Not the stuff of your typical African love fest commercial.  At the end of the scene the Chinese guy sighs and says, “it’s all so tiresome”.   That line, and his expression throughout says so much about…everything.

        Fully agree with you on gay marriage. It’s a frivolous indulgence of a people overly insulated from the consequences of their actions. We’re thumbing our noses at reality, daring it to reassert itself.The China trade stuff is interesting because it’s created another opportunity for the Left to show how fully they’ve abandoned any pro-labor trade policies. A co-worker was ranting about how stupid Trump is to provoke China because they “own our debt, and we’ll be fucked if they call the loans due.” My mention of the dollar’s status as reserve currency, and that we’re not talking about credit card debt got a blank stare. The misunderstanding of how sovereign debt works is par for course, but what I found more interesting was he thought it suicidal and wrong for the U.S. to doanythingto leverage her strength as the world’s largest market to her workers’ advantage. “It just goes against the way the world is moving!”On the subject of trade – in a recent post you mentioned being old enough to remember conservative skepticism toward deregulated capitalism. Can you point me to any specific reading material in that area?

            Way back when gay marriage was still on the front burner, I came across a young fellow one day who was an activist in favor.  He was a polite, intelligent, well-spoken young guy.  He wanted me to sign some petition and I declined; he asked me flat-out if I was against gay marriage, and if so, why?I asked him in reply, If he had to choose between gay marriage and electricity, which would he rather have?He didn’t seem to understand the question.  I explained that by agitating for gay marriage, he was a) working to undermine a centuries-old entente which had kept the social peace and public order, and b) by re-defining the basic understanding of the very meanings of words, he was engaged in a process of civilizational deconstruction, and ultimately ruin, which puts us all back in mud huts in a typhus colony.He was a nice, smart guy, and he clearly understood my reasoning, yet he refused to concede the point, because he just plain wanted what he wanted, and would not negotiate for the greater good.Like Jean Renoir famously said, The trouble with the world is, everybody’s got his reasons.

                    How about this – since the openly gay “practicing Roman Catholic” Sullivan likely doesn’t read this blog, you make the case for gay marriage.
I’m not religious and I used to think gay marriage should be legal, so I’m hardly closed-minded. Change my mind.

        OT:  I want to strongly encourage everyone to watch the first two parts of this documentary investigation.  It is a PBS ‘Frontline’ tier investigation and production, and based entirely on secret video and audio recordings (irrefutable) from a deep, highly, highly successful undercover informer, showing the direct links between the Israeli government, AIPAC, and a plethora of immensely wealthy and coordinated Jewish groups in this country.  Their reach is from Congress, to media outlets like the Associated Press and the Washington Post, down to US universities, and synagogues, applying any and all means, legal and illegal, using highly coordinated, researched, and expensive (and quite knowingly dishonest) media attacks, massively expensive and sophisticated cyber-spying, massive (and it would seem often illegal) campaign contributions to members of Congress, paying for lavish vacations for members of Congress (via the ‘AIPAC loophole’ they engineered into law), et al.  Congressional opponents of all this will quickly find, for example, opponent candidates in their congressional races lavishly funded and supported by these Jewish groups, coordinated media attacks, etc.  Opposing the BDS movement is the initial focus, but other issues, like congressional opposition to the Iraq War, are also addressed.  I promise you, this all applies to our corner of the aisle as well.  Please, watch both parts, and watch the next two parts when they’re released, it’s quite enlightening and damning, to say the least:https://electronicintifada.net/content/watch-film-israel-lobby-didnt-want-you-see/25876

            The documentary was made under the Al Jazeera network, to be aired LAST YEAR, but has been held off the network (until it was leaked in the last few days) because, according to the documentary’s director Clayton Swisher:
“Swisher says that several “leaders of Jewish American organisations” met with Qatar’s registered agent and lobbyist, Nick Muzin – a former aide to US Senator Ted Cruz, who supported American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital – “to see if he could use his ties with the Qataris to stop the airing”.”

            I picture Z in a sport coat and turtleneck.  Turtlenecks aren’t easy to pull off these days.  Takes a certain dude.  I picture him as a Dean Wormer / Jim Rockford type.   I call this scene, “Zman takes Goldberg to the Woodshed.”

                I can attest that Z is not very impressive to behold.  He does get some  credit for the beard and biceps, however.

        I would like to attend the Mencken conference one year.  Can anyone come or do you need to be invited?  I want to meet derb and sailer before it’s too late.  Could one get in trouble in the sense of doxxing do u think?  I’m not sure I can be hurt.

        In regard to same-sex marriage, the solution is simple and quick. You do not have to ban it or make it illegal. You simply have to withdraw recognition.

                I am no longer a libertarian. The campaign for “gay marriage” was a campaign for legal recognition. I suggest that the simplest way to win is to deny that recognition. That is defeat for them.
