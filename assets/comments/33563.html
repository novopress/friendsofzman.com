        Trump didn’t waste the last 4 years, and it’s rather remarkable that a man of his age could switch directions so quickly and thoroughly. As others have said, the Left really screwed itself by forcing him out in 2020.  After 4 years as President, the Left had Trump pretty much hogtied in a corner.  If he could even see where he’d gone wrong, all the lawsuits and stonewalling from every direction were like an endless swarm of stinging insects, keeping him forever on the defensive and making it impossible to find a way out. If they’d allowed his electoral victory to stand in 2020, the following 4 years would have just been a continuation of what had gone before. Things wouldn’t have been as crazy as they were under Biden, but very little of what Trump’s supporters wanted would have been accomplished. But they just couldn’t stand the insult to their egos to allow this interloper to continue to occupy THEIR turf, so they yielded to their spiteful impulses and forced him out.His return in 2024 was unwelcome, but they clearly thought they could control him the same way they had up until 2020. But while Trump has done his homework, they haven’t, and the same weapons that worked so well before are useless now. Trump seems to be operating according to a very systematic plan this time, so it’s not possible that he hasn’t figured out what to do when the crazy judge with an injunction problem arises, as it was certain to do.The whiz kids at DOGE are like Elliot Ness’s Untouchables. Ironically, they’re even attacking the enemy through the side door of finance instead of head-on.  Trump should have a stack of pre-printed Presidential pardons for them sitting permanently on his desk, so that every time a judge issues a stop order he signs them and says “Back to work, boys.”

            Biden’s rampant and self serving abuse of the pardon system paved the way.  Miley? Biden Jr (for 10 years!?). Fauci?  Liz. Cheney?
Everyone on the inner circle of future President’s teams will demand this as a condition of hiring.  Banana republic.

                It seems to me that preemptive pardons are very challengeable in court, and would likely be overturned. But why would a president bring such a challenge that limited his own power? Allowed to stand, we eventually get to a place where every president preemptively pardons his entire administration.

                    “But why would a president bring such a challenge that limited his own power? Allowed to stand, we eventually get to a place where every president preemptively pardons his entire administration.”You’ve answered your own question.  Ever considered that there might be a President elected who thought past his own selfish interests, but rather for the “good of the country”?However, if you can’t conceive of such, then chalk such an action off too a President’s *selfish* interest in building a legacy for himself in future history books which posterity’s children will read.  Washington is—and will be—forever known as the “Father of the Country”.  Could Trump be known as the “Savior of the Country” in our future’s text books?Sounds like the perfect final accomplishment of a narcissistic personality that so far has accomplished just about every goal imaginable in his life.

                    Yes they are, and the scope of the pardons could be another problem, since State level cases could still be brought, based on testimony at the Federal level…It’s a huge potential mess…

                    “It seems to me that preemptive pardons are very challengeable in court, and would likely be overturned.”If so, there’s a long list of them dated prior to January 21, 2025 that would be first in line for attention.  The Democrats would have to deal with THAT mess as soon as they struck the blow at Trump, and their targets are a lot more important than some computer nerds prying into the account books.In any case, the point of such a stratagem is not necessarily to use it. It’s to stymie the lawfare gambit of the Left, and get them to abandon it. If they’re told in no uncertain terms that their usual tactic of finding some judge who’ll spontaneously issue a stop order will be immediately negated by presidential decree, they’ll realize that they’re wasting everyone’s time with futile gestures. Of course the Left will try to go the route of screaming about dictatorship, but it’s not producing the results it used to, and the immensity of the scandal is drowning out the protests.

As I remembered, these type of pardons were rare so I used ChatGPT to confirm and identify:“Preemptive pardons”—grants of clemency issued before any formal charges or convictions—are rare in U.S. history. Before President Biden’s recent actions, only a few notable instances had occurred:President Gerald Ford (1974): Ford granted a “full, free, and absolute pardon” to former President Richard Nixon for any crimes he might have committed during his presidency, following the Watergate scandal.President George H.W. Bush (1992): Bush pardoned six individuals involved in the Iran-Contra affair, including former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and former CIA official Duane Clarridge, before their trials commenced.These instances highlight the exceptional nature of preemptive pardons in U.S. history.”End of ChatGPT quote.

                            Related topic: I asked Google how many impeachments. In our entire history there have been 21 impeachments, only 8 of which were successful. All were Judges. That’s roughly one successful removal from office every 40 years. When one considers the hundreds? Thousands ? of officers, one can see that, for all practical purposes, it’s impossible to be removed via impeachment.

                Z-Man: “The Great Reckoning”Totally Off-Topic, vis-a-vis the above, but this evening, John Campbell posted a new video about excess deaths in the United States, concerning the 25-44 age range, starting at a 2011 baseline, and increasing through to 2023.
The numbers are horrifying.
Campbell immediately had thousands upon thousands of comments to his YouTube video.

                    Definitely.  The difference is that Obama and Biden had the MSM to back them up and repress the “call to arms” such illegal actions ordinarily would require.
As I said before, the enemy sets the “rules of engagement”.  I do not blame Trump for using them in turn.  I believe it is a recurring theme with Z-man that one leaves one’s (antiquated) virtues at the door to the arena when entering for battle.  Winners may retrieve them and revisit/revise them as necessary.

            Indeed, many of us have realized that the Democrats shot themselves in the foot by stealing 2020, and even more so by attempting to assassinate Trump…There are now accusations that Pennsylvania’s Governor Shapiro was involved in the first attempt…The Democrats would also have been well advised to eschew the lawfare attacks, and the ridiculous raid on Mar del Lago, with the fBI going through Melania’s underware..But apparently they can’t help themselves…feminism causes politicians to act solely on emotion, no matter the consequences,,,,

                They’ve already shot the patsy, so it would be nice if we could at least get at some of the lower-level conspirators. It would be noteworthy if a governor or some such official were to be offed in another “robbery gone bad.” Didn’t watch, but heard the network donated time for a slickly-produced Super Bowl ad extolling the virtues of the Secret Service. Considering that agency’s proximity to the Butler event, I’m not too surprised they’d run with that.

                The FBI raid was an assassination attempt, too.“Trump &amp; Brexit” made every Western government become conscious of itself as the enemy of its people. The long train of abuses and usurpations that followed was onlykind ofcrazy, some acceleration of The Plan (all the plans).But rolling on Mar-a-Lago was psychotic, a full-on chimpout of the whole world regime—who all, from king to intern, knew it was coming and what it signified:We kill you all, starting with him.And they fucked it up. All the weirdness since then, the directionless mess of contradictory moves back and forth that at a glance can look like a contest within the regime/elite (it isn’t), is a panicked attempt to recover from whipping out a soft dick and a jammed gun after announcing our rape-murder.

                        Both can be true. They are not a monolithic hive mind. In fact, we are living through what is essentially a civil war between (to first order) two factions of the international jews. I abstract them into the categories of “they love money more than they hate us” and “they hate us more than they love money.”Pres. Trump has the backing of at least an influential part of the “they love money more than they hate us” faction, as long as he focuses on restoring the empire (the source of their rentseeking grift). The “they hate us more than they love money” faction is the part that finally shat out of the bowels of the Democrat Party and tried to put kill America before the other faction had finished harvesting it.It’s not like there isn’t precedent for this notion, even in American history. 20% of Southern slaves were owned by sephardi jews and ashkenazi jews, with Rothschild gold itching for investment in an expanding American empire, backed the North. Different rice bowls lead to different policies …

        “For the last fifty years, these agencies, along with the media, the academy and the vast network of not-for-profits” have controlled “both political parties.”
The USAID revelations have been a victory for conspiracy theorists everywhere. I didn’t believe that a conspiracy involving thousands of people could be kept secret for very long.
Yet for 50 years USAID controlled both political parties and we only started speculating about a uniparty less than 10 years ago.
The existence of a vast conspiracy spanning decades and involving tens of thousands of people has been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.

            The malefic behavior of USAID and ancillary organizations isn’t a conspiracy itself. Rather, it simply became the new governmental norm as America transitioned to AINO. However, Tradissident supposition that something like USAID et al existed and controlled the course of AINO was certainly a species of conspiracy theory. IMO, a conspiracy theory need not be predicated upon the existence of an actual conspiracy. It merely need posit a hypothesis that is radically opposed to the accepted norms of reality. In this latter respect, our theorizing falls under the conspiratorial rubric.

        if Trump is going to take these matters to the USSC, it needs to be done quickly. Going through multiple layers of judicial authority can take months and the whole project will lose steam. If it cannot be done quickly, Trump needs to ignore these rulings and proceed with his agenda. These judges have no authority to make such rulings and, more importantly, no power to enforce them. Give ’em the finger and press on!

I’ve come to the same conclusion.
That said, I think the entire concept of an impartial judiciary is broken.
Judge are human. There never has been or will be such a thing as a completely impartial human.
The closest human to that ideal is a benevolent despot who has so much wealth, power, and family that it would be nearly impossible to influence them.

            I still have no idea how a judge who only has authority over his district somehow has authority over the nation’s President.
Well, these are the same dicks that gave themselves the authority to issue gag orders. Since a person is presumed innocent until the trial resolves, how can judges directly violate the First Amendment, saying a free citizen cannot talk about the fact that someone is accusing him of something?

            Since we live in an inauthentic era, one has to wonder how much of her support is real. I would say the same about the Pulitzer Prize-winning halftime performer.
Watching clips of the booing, I find it curious she wasn’t really done up and looked a bit pudgy. It makes one wonder if she already knew the outcome of the game and thus would not be featured in the coverage.

                “Authenticity” enjoys an odd career in AINO. As you say, everything about this country is inauthentic, e.g., fake and ghey. But the faker and gheyer it gets, the more businessmen crow and preen over the ostensible authenticity of their product. You see this especially in the food/restaurant industry where everything from tacos to biscuits is billed as authentic “Mexican” or “country.”
A rhetorical offshoot of authenticity is “artisanal.” That partical board desk may have been assembled by robots in Chungking or slave labor in Shanghai, but by gawd it’s artisanal!

                What a farce the Superbowl has become. Half time shows– It’s been bantus twerking, negroids rapping for many years in a row now with nary a White act in sight. Does the demographics in the stands reflect this? No, but the fans &amp; grillers, paypigs that they are, will keep loyally watching hoping their Wakandan wins. Embarrassing…

                    Jay, I tossed my Talmudvision into the landfill about seven years ago.Haven’t watched any n!66erball ever since.I can’t fathom the psychological makeup of my former Normie Acquaintances who are busily wasting away the remainder of their lives in an attempt to absorb all the histrionic diarrhea being served up by the Talmudvision.The Talmudvision is a damned powerful tool for destroying entire civilizations.Just about exactly 80% of all Amurrikkkunz are v@xxinated; only about 20% remain purebl00ded.My guess is that the20% purebl00ded are likely to be precisely the same folks who had long since banished the Talmudvisions from their homes when COVID rolled into town in early 2020.

                To be fair, she was a pretty, attractive White girl with a decent voice singing about high school romances (in her early years).  She was also heavily promoted and her competition was a bunch of sheboons and assorted gutteral trash.  Not surprising she did well financially.  Of course, had to sell her soul, but such is the price of stardom.

        It seems to me that another thing going on with Trump lately is his complete sidelining of the feckless GOP cucks in Congress.  He’s been giving lip service to working with them, but it seems as if he’s completely excluding them from his assault on the Blob.  I see the cucks showing up occasionally on the news, but they’re always talking about “who-gives-a-s**t” stuff like continuing resolutions and debt ceilings.  I don’t know if this is a conscious part of Trump’s plan, but it seems like he’s just going to let them play their little failure theater games unattended.  When they pass a budget that continues funding the Blob at current levels as they always do, Trump will just continue to attack the spending on his end.  It’s looking like the perfect way to deal with them as they’d simply screw everything up if they got involved with Trump’s plans directly, and they’re too worthless and lacking in initiative to actively legislate opposition to him.

            Great point. As mentioned in the OP, the offices they hold are largely symbolic at this point so there only concern is re-election. While undoubtedly some of their princesses are getting their beaks wet in the NGO sugar well, for the most part the Republican members represent places with little interest and even some hostility to the NGO ecosystem. Their cowardice/impotence works to Trump’s advantage here.

                    That’s what much of the charade around Nixon was about. After his ouster, the 1974 Omnibus Budget Act stripped the Executive of his ability to veto specific items line by line; it was a major step in the exponential growth of the Blob.
p.s.- it also wasn’t Nixon who ‘took us off the gold standard’ in 1971; that would be Treasury Secretary John Connelly under him, the same guy sitting in the car (and wounded by the Magic Bullet) when JFK got shot.

                I believe he does have a plan—the SCOTUS.  He’s hedging his bets on getting a decision out of them by simply issuing EO after EO and generating RO’s (and eventually ignoring them) in the lower courts.  SCOTUS will be forced to decide on some of them—albeit, Z-man’s analysis is not without merit and evidence.  The judicial system is loath to involve itself in politically sensitive matters.  However the degeneration of the lawful function of government may be more than SCOTUS can bear.  If the system fails, SCOTUS cannot avoid falling with it—one must choose sides.

        As always, it comes down to who-whom. These judges clearly see themselves as part of the liberal rules-based democratic order and are seeking to protect it. It’s exactly the same thing as when, say, a President enacts a program in clear defiance of Congress and then the next President, trying to shut it down, is not allowed to by the court. This is because this program (and I’m talking about DACA) clearly benefits the regime and the courts work to protect the regime. So, I expect a lot of tortured court opinions followed by cheering from the regime’s media apparatuses and legal experts, all of whom we are learning are paid by the regime.Either the President is in charge of the Executive Branch or he’s not. If he is not, then we need to know who is, and this is something they don’t want to tell us and haven’t told us for a very long time. Luckily for us, though, we just got off a four year term of the Presidentclearlynot being in charge of the Executive Branch and it seems that people didn’t like what they saw. So, there is clearly an appetite for fixing this issue.

From the POV of the average American, this scenario is win/win. To be clear, I want to Trump to win. However, even if he loses, we know where Presidents now really stand compared to the Blob.

            It would be clarifying to ask the deans of Harvard’s and Yale’s law schools if they sincerely believe that the Presidency can be checked by ex parte rulings out of New York districts.
They could straighten out their insane professoriats and end this mal-education with a single “Dean’s Declaration.”
It’s time to reign in the radicals, and their Alma Maters’d be a great place to start.  This lawfare battle is really an intra-mural fight, and it properly belongs on campus.  Take the battle to them, and leave no ground for them to go to.

        The recent Chevron (6-3) decision suggests a majority may be in favor of clarifying these issues. The Progs wailed loudly after this decision, which limits the right of the Executive bureaucracy to interpret laws. Of course, now that the “shoe is on the other foot”, and Trump (at least nominally) controls the Executive branch, they are making convoluted arguments about limiting Executive power – the exact opposite of what they argued last year. So it’s all “who/whom” bullsh*t as usual. The Constitution is now toilet paper.

            There is an interesting vice forming up. One jaw is the court curtailing of administrative power. Unless Congress explicitly gives an agency the authority to do something, they lack the authority to do it. Therefore, unless Congress bans incandescent bulbs, the DoE cannot do it, even though it is tasked with saving energy.The other jaw is the unitary executive. When Congress does give an agency authority to act, how it acts is up to the President. This means Congress gets into the business of very narrowly tailoring their authorizations to these agencies.The result is the administrative state being reduced to bureaucracy. In such a world, there is no need for a highly credentialed expert class.

                Right. But the “countermeasure” to this is that all the Experts just become lobbyists who draft the laws to their masters’ satisfaction. Their laws then get passed verbatim by the supine Congress whom they pay. This of course is already happening, but it will become standard for all laws now.This is the exact opposite of the English Common Law tradition. We’re going to  to have the Napoleonic Code at this rate. The size of shower heads and dishwasher pipes will be enshrined in laws passed by Congress……

                    There is a limited market for lobbyists and political advisers, and it is far smaller than this NGO support system is/was. As Z pointed out in the OP, the blitzkrieg strategy has caught most of the participants flat-footed and scurrying around to try to find how to make mortgages and car payments. Real estate prices around Arlington are about to stabilize for the first time in decades. Many of those hit will migrate to places like Seattle to try to find a similar way to make ends meet.

Is it? One of the lawsuits filed to stop Trump is based on the idea that it would be unconstitutional to expose the data of the people authorizing the payments.

            That is not their decision to make. If you learn nothing else from recent events – this should be the one you retain. You get what you tolerate.Trump is taking the dreaded step of actually starting to break the Left’s toys. Putting a stop to the BS and putting out the fires is all well and good… but as our Esteemed Blog Host notes – they absolutely MUST get rid of the fire starters. AND punish them. People have to see them being punished too.There are millions of recently red pilled normies and grillers headed your way, Dissidents. Hope you can handle the load.

        After watching this all unfold the last 3 weeks, it’s become pretty clear that Trump is the front man who is performing his role perfectly. He gets to be on camera, mock the silly reporters and signs the EOs. Perfect for him. He’s intelligent enough to keep his finger on the pulse of the people around him and make adjustments on the fly.The billionaires who made their deals with him leading up to the election have their guys behind the scenes doing much of the heavy lifting. The arrangement is also perfect for them because they don’t have to look like the cause of these dramatic changes, that falls on Trump. Mark Cuban playing the left with his annoying moaning about transparency is a joke. He knows exactly what is going on. Late night TV guys mocking pentagon spending is another signal things are changing.Even if you are a MAGA nut like Bannon and think Trump is some kind of divine creature, you have to admit the team Trump has behind him this time is lightyears better than the bumbling group of has-been GOP rejects he was surrounded with before. This new administrative team (and the power brokers behind them) is the best reason why the toppling of the blob has a chance to succeed.The opportunity for dissidents is the toxic culture caught in the power vacuum. The anti-White agenda being swept aside by these changes should be taken advantage of.

            Going after the Pentagon will, if not win over, at least mollify much of the “center left” that is perplexed by all this, and convince them that Trump actually is a reformer. They have always thought of it as a right wing institution, and still do, in spite of the fact that it no longer is.

            It’s infuriating. We see so many elderly that worked their whole lives, to the detriment of their bodies many times, suffering and just getting by in an unrepaired house because they like to eat and have heat instead of home repairs. No live-in nurses and on-call 24/7 concierge doctors for them like these politicians and these NGO heads have that are paid for by the tax-payer in one way or the other. No fancy European vacation/’hip replacement’ for them, either.Then we have the veterans, of course. The homeless. So many Americans just suffering more and more every year and these bastards want to cry, like Samantha Powers, about losing their grift and then try to guilt and shame Americans with some figment of a foreign child who needs YOUR help and your tax MONEY, never mind the American kids who need help. And there are plenty of them. Of course, for the foreign kids to get the bowl of rice their government has to allow the transing of them. And here too, it seems. It’s all so sick.But they want to give our money, firstly to themselves, you all saw those on-paper huge salaries, and then next to foreigners. These crooks are getting rich, but there’s more to it than that, they truly hate America and Americans.Anyway, bottom line, there was a reason the CIA wasn’t supposed to operate at home the way they do abroad. And we see why playing out right now. It was because do this shit at home and the people are going to figure it out, and then the rest of the world will be like FINALLY!, and then it’s over for them. They were stupid.

        Even if they do manage to kill off the Blob the individual elements will manage to find new homes in foreign funding. Angiogenesis inhibitors at one time were supposed to be the Silver Bullet in cancer research. But the results were modest at best. The cancer cells were able to metastasize to find new locations in the body to continue their assault. There are plenty of countries in the world that will continue the assault against America through funding the woke plague. One of the main reasons the “civil rights” movement gained such traction during the Cold war was the propaganda by communist regimes to “live up to our ideals.” It worked. This is a long fight.

                    Our greatest ally already pumps a ton of money into the system and, no, that won’t stop. As to the others, I doubt that they’d do much, but it’s an issue that should be addressed. Trump should ban foreign money. Even our greatest ally could deal with that buy simply using American Jews to funnel the money to wherever they want.

                It’s not out of the question. Putin, for instance, endorsed Kamaltoe. Now whether did that because he actually supported her or because he knew endorsing Trump would harm Trump’s electoral chances is a matter for debate. However, anti-white Leftism is deadlier to any Western nation than ICBMs, so if you desire to undermine the BFE, you could do worse than fund the Left. Think of it as color revolution coming home to roost.

            It is an interesting problem. Let’s say a million people were living off this economic model. Not all of them will be fired now that USAID is shuttered, but many have already been let go. This will accelerate. Where do these people go? There are only so many spots at the trough and the competition for them is about to get quite nasty.Look at what is happening with the “extremist” people in the media. They are all getting canned now, so where do they go? They will still exist on social media, but eventually, they need to get regular jobs to pay their bills. It is hard to be an anti-extremism activist when you are stocking shelves at Lowes.Now, think of the same thing with regards to not-for-profit activism. As these people leave the system, their network will collapse, making it difficult for these unemployed activists to remain activists. It is the reason there is panic in that space. Without the money, they go back to be normies working in retail.

                That’s the thing. These people have no private sector skills. There’s no market for writing reports on white nationalists or trans activism. Even the other jobs don’t have a private sector niche. Writing grant proposals requires skill but has limited appeal.
I also wonder how much impact the cutting off of funds will have on academia.
Regardless, will be interesting to see what happens to various neighborhoods in NoVa.

                        Decades ago, one of the then-popular conservative investment writers (Ruff or North, not sure) said, if I recall correctly: Washington DC area real estate had never fallen in value, even during the Great Depression. Also, he opined that if DC area ever truly did experience a recession worthy of the name, that it’d probably be a positive sign for the rest of the nation.It’s my fervent hope that latter prediction is finally coming true.

                        Much remains to be seen here.  Some observations from an old academic involved in “grantsmanship”. NIH is one of many Fed organs that fund research.  For example, NSF was the agency we wrote most grants to.  Then there is the military, as in DARPA.Second, it is implied that the overhead is some arbitrary number that is chosen by the university institution.  Our university overhead was negotiated, and then approved yearly (by the Fed’s) and was between the Fed’s and the university, but not dependent upon any specific grant application, nor solely under the university’s arbitrary control.Third, the overhead figure was for more than just some clerical efforts, like payroll, or custodial services.  Overhead went into supplying materials to the specifics of the grant such as lab space, personnel, and the like.None of the above is to justify any specific dollar percentage, just to point out how the game was played back in the day.  My suspicion is that grants will simply be rewritten to account for lack of overhead cost recovery backfill.  This of course will make the process more transparent, but will it save taxpayer dollars?

It very well might be enormous. I had assumed many elite institutions had such plush endowments they were largely independent, but Harvard’s rapid dismissal* of Claudine Gay after Bill Ackman cut off donations over the Pali protests disabused me of that notion. Universities may suffer the biggest knock-on effects since they were intimately involved in the NGO patronage system and received a lot of sugar to employ certain folks and produce desired studies.

                        FedGov grease funds pork. Remove the grease and the pork shrivels down to a lump of gristle. In other words, unis would have to retreat from their pasttime of being hard Left Club Med resorts, and focus instead on the original mission, which is educating kids who just graduated from high school. All the better if FedGov began auditing courses to uncover Leftist propaganda and tied restoration of funds to ceasing indoctrination.

                        There are two ways to look at our society’s ills. One is from the moral POV and the other is from the standpoint of efficiency. It’s no surprise that Musk’s minions are theDept of GovernmentEfficiency.It turns out that evaluating our problems from the moral or efficiency POV leads to the same prescriptions.Musk and the other Tech Bros are a bunch of Asperger cases who mostly don’t grok the moral side of the rot in this country. That said, turning them loose on the massive inefficiency of all of our society’s institutions will, in many cases, have the side effect of addressing the moral rot, if only by taking resources away from the people who benefit from and perpetuate it. Modern America’s massive inversion of the natural order of things requires equally massive amounts of money and effort to sustain.In the case of higher education no more than about 10% of the population is really cognitively capable of making any use of a college education. The rest can go to trade schools or get on the job training. If you need to get the government involved, set up tax breaks for businesses that offer apprenticeships. As for the pseudo-intellectuals being paid to teach liberal arts gibberish to daddy’s little princesses and soyboys? Well, we’re going to need someone to pick the cauliflower once the illegals are gone.DEI? Forcing skilled White men to sit idle while xirls and rainbow hued morons are paid to pretend to do their jobs is not only inefficient but pours gasoline on the fires destroying the social fabric and aggravating the resentments that will eventually lead to civil war. Sending all those xirlbosses home might also help get the birthrate back up from it’s current catastrophically low levels.“Defense”? Imagine making the Dept of Defense live up (well really down, way down) to its supposed mission, which is defending the country, this country, not Ukraine, Georgia, or Israel.Everywhere you look, you find that righting the moral applecart and restoring the natural hierarchy of people and things is also a lot cheaper and more efficient.

                        Well yes and no. Some of the wealthiest universities have enormous tax-free investments. I recall the claim that e.g. Harvard, even if all future donations dried up, could do quite nicely solely on earned income from its existing investments. That certainly seems reasonable when you consider the assets owned and the (relatively) small annual costs of running a university.Now, to be sure, such institutions would rather have ongoing streams of outside income, whether from wealthy individuals, private corporations, or public money whether direct or laundered through NGOs.And yes, probably the less affluent institutions would suffer more if the outside funding dries up. But the point that the wealthiest have a huge war chest of “fuck you money” would seem to remain valid.

                    What little market outside of the D.C. Metro area exists can be found in the Blue hives from whence many came: Austin, Portland, Seattle, Madison, and so forth. I expect many will try to land similar gigs there, which goes to the importance of drying up the local and state equivalents.

                        We chose our current location for numerous reasons; in addition to being 100 miles away from an interstate highway, we ensured we are also more than 100 miles away from any synagogue or hindu temple.  Various ethnicities will always ensure ‘their people’ have a ‘safe space’ in a homogeneous community.  That needs to be destroyed. No more Lakewood, New Jerseys or Chinatowns. They are the soil that shelters and breeds the seeds of White destruction.

The others are trying to do a facelift to their cv, by their own words. So “1 year promoting diversity and inclusion in Uganda” becomes “1 year leading a project to improve the economic sector in Uganda and its economic relationship with USA”. After all, USA paid for everything. What other proof of international trade do you want? And what happens in Uganda, stays in Uganda so nobody needs to know

                    The top tier elements in this corrupt enterprise need to be executed (I am serious this is not hyperbole). The second tier needs 20 to 30 years in Gitmo or an El Salvadoran prison. The 10’s of thousands of third tier minions need 5 to 10 years in the Federal pen. This is the only way to fix this problem.

                    I concur.  I celebrate each head that rolls along with everyone else, but I don’t pretend it represents the end of the opposition.  For each individual axed, there are tens of thousands of underlings and followers.  There’s an army of new ‘girl bosses’ waiting in the wings (must send your princesses to college), along with non-White agitators.  And for all the talk of Vance, AINO will be barely 50% White by 2030.  I don’t care how many EOs Trump signs; demographics is destiny.

It is why even though I’m over the moon that Trump is starting to become the thing they always painted him to be, it won’t be NEARLY enough. It is why I’m posting this thought from one of the Whitest parts of the world remaining.
Until the ‘real’ roundups start. The kind that require boxcars and men of iron will, I’m not holding my breath on a true turnaround.

                The blitzkrieg element of this attack was significant. In addition to being a slush fund for UMC Karens, most members of the Blob nomenklatura who were needed for it to function were dependent on their weekly reward. As you mentioned in the main piece, mortgages and car payments suddenly ended and the ability to wait for a court decision is limited.

                        The access order included “payment systems” from the article I read. Computer access to angry and scared about to be ex-employees in and of itself is huge security risk, with people wanting to cover their tracks, steal data, and potentially scramble entire systems. God willing, saner heads have already laughed their behinds off, done nothing, and put in an emergency stay of the order. We’ll see if that garners the same headlines.The Karens themselves are still mostly on leave with pay, so they aren’t concerned about this month’s car payments yet. They are worried about covering their tracks and paying off their friends with government money.

                            Your fears of the risk of misdeeds by employee or contractor are entirely valid. My working years included working some hush-hush military and slightly less sensitive Federal contracting positions. Suffice to say that I saw first-hand many lapses, when passwords and other security measures were not quite as rigorous as they might have been or were supposed to be.It seems that DOGE and perhaps other incoming teams came with very well laid plans. It seems unlikely they could have locked out all existing government employees from all their systems. To do so would have frozen nearly all operations at a targeted agency. I hope they were able to obtain image backups of databases (e.g. the records of Treasury payments) that would then be kept under lock and key, out of the hands of not-to-be-trusted government staff. The latter can’t realistically be stopped from modifying, deleting or otherwise falsifying data, but that’s damned hard to do when there is a (hopefully clean) achieved copy that’s out of their reach.

                Were I Benevolent Dictator, all those bureaucrats would be plucking chickens for Tyson after I kicked out all the illegals.  Tyson would be under new management, of course, because the CEO would be in the pen for hiring illegals.

                            Lots of locals thatraise chicken and cows – but they all sell to the big corporations.  I have been unable to source retail sold local meat.  I do have one guy who offered to raise a cow for me, but I don’t use all the cuts and definitely need more freezer space.  I tend to do my shopping (fresh produce and bread, etc.) once a week.  I suppose I could drive a 4 hour round trip for more options, but I don’t want to spend the time or the gas.

                These people are going to learn just how disastrous the de-industrialization of the USA is. Those-good paying jobs in industry and all the professions that depended on industry are gone. The government jobs that replaced them are going away too. It’s a lesson the working class learned already but now the keyboard jockeys will get the lesson.

                What did they do before we found out what they were doing? That’s what they’ll do now.Some won’t, of course. A reorganization is a great chance to get rid of some jerk who annoys you. The crazy-eyed show tune singer Biden tried to put in charge of censorship, her job may actually be in danger (unless she’s somebody’s mistress).Taylor Lorenz—local repeater of propaganda and “doxx” fed to her by foreign intelligence—got fired from the Post for some Gaza thing, last we heard. Where is she now? On Patreon, being funded anonymously by the same spooks she was before. To do what? The same sort of thing. We don’t know what it is.It’s a family, not a business.

                Do you know people who work (or worked) for USAID?  Are they “studies” majors from Georgetown or something like that?
I took and passed the foreign service test in 2011.  Didn’t get past the essay portion of the interview process.  At the time I thought I might like working in a foreign country.  Now I’m glad that I didn’t end up working for the DC blob.

            What foreign funding? A lot of the “foreign funding” is actually from USAID and passes hands 2 or 3 times before it arrives at some foreign rainmaker. I highly doubt Paris or the City of London is going to step in and fill the void, nor do I think they are even capable of doing it. Tokyo is more likely to start looking after itself and returning to the natural state of the Japanese people. And Moscow and Beijing certainly aren’t.It is possible that this incredible elite uniformity of thought and buy-in that we have seen since the end of the Cold War in America was largely paid off with printed money. If that spigot is turned off, we might start to see the sort of actual elite conflict that you normally see in large empires towards the end stage.

                Certain “dissidents”  will not believe that the US is the villain of the piece. It’s always those nefarious foreigners corrupting the good  folk at USAID and State.
The convoluted theories they must have to explain the current situation where the King of England or the CCP is blackmailing Larry Ellison or Fink. If only the Brazilians would stop threatening the State Department then the those good christian folk working foreign policy could start promoting world peace.

                    Actually, I do believe that the US is the chief villain. “We hold these truths to be self-evident…” But stating the obvious that the source lies in our own origins proves my point that this is not going to be easy.

                        People forget that the USA began as a liberal, revolutionary state. The logic of the liberal revolution is the destruction of the natural  hierarchies of society and their replacement with an artificial fake equality (fake because the enforcers of that equality are ruling and not equal to the ruled). It is Orwell’s jibe against revolutionaries: “All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.” The American revolutionaries ended up the same as the others: they did not end oppression, they became the oppressors.

            It takes massive amounts of public money to support these cancer cells, which will collapse very quickly once it is withdrawn. During the Cold War the communists were at a great disadvantage also on the propaganda and subversion fronts due to the wealth disparity, which persists to this day even with China. The individual people within the Blob are about as hostile to Russia and China as they are to their own citizens. Those individuals situated within the NGO’s might gravitate to conventional politics but they are distrusted and that sphere is demand driven. The NGO-created nomenklatura probably is done and has been shown to be less resilient than would be expected after eighty years, arguably more than 100, of entrenchment and expansion. In addition to being obviously familiar with the system at a granular level, the Tech Bro wreckers also have shown a strategic acumen that is a little unsettling if they decide to use it against us.

Would you care to expand your thinking? It seems honest and productive output should be somewhat safe from de-funding as there is a real output/product to purchase.

Females are a privileged caste in American law and society.  The entire education system, and the culture, cultivate empowered girls and women.The U.S. is a feminist nation.  All its institutions are feminized or overtly feminist.  America is ruled, at ground level, by females.  The Trump attack on the fed-trough feeders weakens the sisterhood indirectly, as they constitute a high percentage of leftie fed employees and beneficiaries.  The State is the husband of the American female.Donald is an Eighties liberal and thus a feminist, and it’s hard to see him dismantling the massive grift of feminist foundations, NGOs, agencies, programs, on and on.  For example, Donald’s Senior Advisor of the new White House Faith Office is a New Age witch named Paula White-Cain.  She is an affront to God and a walking heresy.Whatever else Orange Man is, he is one lost spiritual puppy, reliant for spiritual counsel on some silly, glib, Oprah Show Religion huckster.

The turn-of-phrase Z used once was “gynocracy”.  Thing is there is a strong anti-tranny streak in feminism, but due to it’s inherit contradictions (of only reaching conclusions via consensus) it is unable to address the issue.  This has put them back on their heels as they like that the trannydom is being reined in, but they can’t bring themselves to thank Trump as that goes against the regime consensus, for now.

                The fact that:trannies &gt; womendemonstrates that liberal women are not the ultimate power.
Those who forced us to accept trannies are more powerful than feminists.  In my opinion, the goal of those with the most power is to dispossess traditional whites worldwide.
Those with the most power push feminism until feminism conflicts with their greater goals and then feminism loses.

                    Correct. And as I’ve noted before, the only reason rape isn’t classed as a hate crime is because doing so would result in even more Hutus in the slammer for long stretches, and Hutus are considerably higher on the Left’s victim totem pole than are dames. Also, Sassy Mammies enjoy far more cachet on the Left than blue-eyed Katelyns and Brittanees.

                It is surely a gynocracy.Feminism foundered on the trans issue.  Trans is a direct outgrowth of antinomian feminism, the old Victim Totempole.Trans is feminism’s bastard child.  Girls and their parents wailed when men started dressing up and taking advantage of the totempole, as they’d done themselves for many decades.  But they were fine the past half-century while females took over basically everything and kicked men out.  Not even the Boy Scouts escaped.But suddenly, there’s a crisis!  Trans men are stealing the medals of our princesses!  lolLike yourself, I run on the Sammich Platform.  Lots more sammiches and lots less feminism.

            Feminism Inc is the result of over a century of male abandonment of civilization, including a disinclination to support mothers, daughters, and even eventually their own wives in the late 20th century. That entrenchment in the West will not be undone in 2 weeks or 3 months or a year. There are ways to speed the transition up considerably (see: the Taliban), but that would be quite the shock.Orange Man is a transition figure, one I am deeply grateful for. He is the start of the unwinding of one heck of century for everyone, including all the men lost to the pointless Great War that the Jews won.This post appears to be mostly about unrealistic expectations. Short of a Taliban like group coming to power, we’re turning the ship around. It’s a big ship and even stopping takes time. I for one am grateful for any progress along those lines.

                    “Spoken like a closet-feminist ‘conservative’.”Being serious about undoing feminism is about being ready to support your mother, wife and daughters, possibly until they (or you) die. The Taliban are willing to drive their women everywhere, because they are serious about undoing feminism. Yes the women are under control and out of public structures, but also yes, they have to drive them everywhere, too.On a personal level, for a responsible male, undoing feminism looks like a lot of work, which is boring and unfulfilling It’s no womanizing, less toys, boring jobs, and yes supporting less than perfect people.If you’re not prepared to take on that level of personal responsibility, the posts amount to whining “Da wymen, they did me wrong”. It’s sentiment that I note Adam was punished for. God didn’t think much of that excuse, so I don’t know why I would.

                He is the start of the unwinding of one heck of century for everyoneFeminism began centuries ago, like the USA, a cancer which you don’t understand. We don’t need to unwind just the 20th century. That century didn’t happen to the USA. Rather, the USA happened to the world, then came the 20th century mostly because of her and what she made possible.So the authority clause of the Con must be discredited and abandoned. The egalitarian claptrap in the DoI must be discredited and abandoned. The Congress, the presidency, and the SCOTUS must go away. There must be no more DC, only the city once called Washington, with its territory part of a state surely not named after an Israelite or a queen named to honor that Israelite. Appearances of the rotten wrong turn made centuries ago will remain for centuries, but the institutional and philosophical substance of “Novus Ordo Seclorum” belongs in the landfill of history.

                    Feminism as we know it appears roughly at the end of the 19th century. We don’t need to go much beyond there to find a society while not perfect, it was well ordered. It’s more than a century at this point, but century will do for the purposes of thinking about it.

                    Bollocks. ‘Centuries ago’ didn’t market tobacco and flappers as independence, Prohibition as freedom from drunken husbands, or Freidan and Steinem as freedom from housekeeping and bras.
‘Centuries ago’ didn’t print posters saying, “There is no Feminism without Liberation, there is no Liberation without Feminism.”
‘Centuries ago’ didn’t invent the Pill, make abortion a public industry, make porn an industry, provide lawyers for gay rights and the Weathermen, or use judicial fiat to overturn a referendum on gay marriage in California.

        Marco Rubio made our host’s point in his Fox News interview while in El Salvador.  He described USAID’s haughty refusal to participate in the Trump appointees’ attempt to audit paused programs and payments, as contrasted with the co-operation at State (Sadly I lack the skills to link.)
Rubio is a wholly owned subsidiary of Norman Braman so, yes, it looks like the owners have decided to unleash their politicians to remove their managers.

        I just read this morning that Bill Clinton fired almost 400,000 federal workers during his 2 terms.  This did almost nothing to stop the blob and was a temporary reduction of the swamp.  The second they had an excuse to hiring hundreds of thousands of new workers, probably because of 911, the swamp came right back.

            9/11 provided the excuse for the biggest growth of the Blob since the New Deal, with the added bonus that they got to use all the “anti-terrorist” bullshit against their domestic political enemies.
Remember how pissed off they were that 9/11 happened on W’s watch instead of Clinton’s or Gore’s, they were salivating at the opportunity but couldn’t take advantage of it until the Kenyan was installed.

                To elaborate, we don’t know 100% for sure if SCOTUS is on Trump’s side, Chevron suggests that it may be, but who trusts Roberts, Barrett, and Kavanaugh?But even if SCOTUS sides with Trump, that won’t be the end of anything. The “blob” has many multiple lines of defense (on top of their routine day to day bureaucratic resistance). Going back to 2016, first was the FBI and their made up stories. Followed by the ridiculous peach mints over more made up nonsense. Then the plandemic and the stolen election, followed by the manufactured riot at the Capitol. Then lawfare. Then assassination attempts. Now judicial obstruction, which if it fails, will just move on to the next line of defenses. At some point, if necessary, it finally gets to their rigged stock market and the deliberate crashing of it to be blamed on Trump and “populism.” And so on. One thing we know is they will never give up. The day that they say “ok, you won, we give up, you can run the government,” will never, ever come.It would be hopeless if not for the fact that Trump has new powerful allies whom he previously lacked, who may be able to overcome/circumvent some of the blob’s defenses. Probably often in ways that we will never see or hear about. Of course at some point, the question arises of who is really driving the bus, Trump, or them

                Agree. And I have wondered about the other non-govt donors. The Blob was, among other things, a protection racket. Sure, many corporations have become pretty woke, so some money will still flow, but others were just paying as a form of insurance. If Trump/Musk can weaken the Blob enough, that protection racket starts to lose a lot of its punch.Let’s say that half the money to the Blog came from the govt and half from private donors. If you cut off the govt money and, say, half of the private money, the Blob is severely weakened. Combine that with a general cultural shift, and it could become fairly irrelevant.I also think that the rehiring of the DOGE kid was a major deal. It would almost have been better if he was very publicly hired by some tech firm. Regardless, the minute that people fired for expressing their personal opinions are quickly hired by other firms is the minute that Blob loses perhaps its greatest weapon.

                        Lobbying for favorable treatment will always be with us. Paying off NGOs that then stir up trouble around the world, push gay agendas and promote crazy DAs in America is a different matter. I suspect Pfizer would be happy to leave out that second part.

                            Fair enough. But I’m not so sure. Foreign intrigue has been part of multinational corporate DNA for a long time. Any company relying on mineral rights or patent protection needs a friendly local government.

                        I personally know a Pfizer scientist that gave me the lowdown on the jab, in terms of risk of harmful effects per MRNA injected. When I tried to warn Normie friends and family, armed with first-person information … waste of breath.
Now some of them have regrets. Some stopped after 2 injections. Some three. Some are still true believers and one can go to any big drug store chain and see signs encouraging them to get their “flu and Covid vaccines…” Mostly complete silence, denial, blink eyes if subject is brought up.

In line with your anecdote, Vox Day made a recent post about a similar anecdote on the same topic.
His correct advice was to avoid going hard with normies, because it always backfires and generates resentment. That’s just how normies are wired.

                                This certainly seems the case.  However, I tend to skirt around direct confrontation.  Leave the individual out and talk some generalizations of latest findings in passing.  Family is another matter however.  There was no beating around the bush with son and grandchildren.  He was plainly told to be a man and reject any proposal to jab the grandchildren.  Point being made he’d be a pariah if the kids came by and spoke of the jab.

                        Your point is taken, but one should also take into consideration that huge amounts of funding from various channels (including from government) also are basically “lobbying” at no cost to Pfizer. This is a central feature of The Blob, the back scratching that goes on (hopefully, “went on”) at some combination of taxpayer’s and naive donor’s expense.Furthermore, viewed from certain perspectives, the billions spent on “research” support an entrenched ecosystem of institutions, researchers and other staff entirely dependent upon such funding. This has the effect of making all the people who cash a check written by Pfizer a “lobbyist” to some degree.

                    Agree the rehire is a big deal, particularly for the Millennial/GenZ crowd. I remember back in my CA college days and first started seeing people being fired for stuff they were saying on socials. This was around 2009 or so, right around the time of the Bush/Obama transition. Everyone at school who had right leaning opinions got quiet real quick.It’s been great to see this kid get a second chance. Certainly a good step, but the overall framing is still way off. You’ve got hateful, anti-White bigots on X saying stuff much worse on a daily basis without repercussion. This doxing/firing agenda is targeted at us specifically. At minimum, our people need to have that much leeway in their freedom of speech too.

That is the whole basis – along with immigration – for wholesale population replacement and White erasure.  Yes, controlling the money spigot is vital, but the cultural rot is deep.  Forcing the worst of the sexual degenerates out of the spotlight is fine, but Trump attended the big sportsbowl filled with nothing but black singing and gyrating and animalistic entertainment.  This is what the world accepts as “American” culture.  If those trillions in government debt were spent on White family formation instead of black/brown/yellow people, would most dissidents care?  At this point, I certainly wouldn’t.

                            OK, so Trump made a publicity stop at the Super Bowl.One possible perspective (yours) appears to be that’s unacceptable, as there was (and I don’t dispute) a bunch of decadent performance that sadly reflects contemporary American trends but not “traditional” (dare I say it, “White”) values.Should Trump have boycotted the event? Perhaps. But another perspective could be that by appearing, Trump showed in stark relief those traditional values against the degenerate entertainment otherwise on exhibit. And from what I’ve read, Trump was enormously popular with the crowds. A crowd that would boo Taylor Swift is almost unprecedented, so I would think.

                    I wish Musk and DOGE great success in attacking The Blob. Nonetheless, I have misgivings. Rare is the politician newly ascended into a position of power that didnottend to favor his own interests and allies. It’s very difficult to be neutral. What guarantee do we have that something as bad won’t simply replace what (we hope!) DOGE demolishes? For argument, let’s say that USAID was funneling money that advocated for sex changes for impressionable children in Country X or maybe even at home. Yes, that’s disgusting to decent people. Now assume that USAID begins spending the same amount of money to promote traditional sex roles. Most “normal” people would say that’s an improvement. Perhaps it is, but it’s missing the point. Those are improper use’s of taxpayer monies. Despite the noblest intentions, it’s also unavoidable that the public trough will tend to create an ecosystem dependent upon it. If you’re sucking at the public teat it doesn’t really make any difference if you’re left- or right wing. Frankly, I will be less cynical of Musk when all subsidies for electric vehicles, solar energy and so on are cancelled. I’m not holding my breath.

                I hear from my sources inside the USAID money-sucking borg that they are scared and angry. That an understatement.
It is somewhat reassuring to know that since these tiny borglets cannot check their own oil, their replies are mainly those of the keyboard warrior, absent the easy money. They best be ‘learning to code’ the snotty fucks.

                    That’s why the injunction order on Friday about allowing back full access to USAID is the actual cybersecurity risk. Angry and scared about to be ex-employees are routinely cut off from access in big corporations because of the obvious security threat, sometime within an hour of notification, just depending.If I were in charge of It security for the US government, I’d be insisting that lawyers get a Monday stay and that no further action would be taken until it was resolved in court. This IT security 101 here.

                He won’t stop all immigration, especially from India, but on other matters, he seems ready to go. I’d suspect that he has a much deeper understanding of the Blob than Trump.I’ve said for a long time that Vance climbed the greasy ladder only to discover that he’d never have a place at the table. Same with that grifter Vivek. They decided to overturn the table rather than being high-paid house slaves.Does that mean that they’re necessarily on our side? No. But they’re definitely moving the ball down the field for many of the things that our side wants. Ride the bus when it’s going your direct. Get off when it’s not.

                It’s not about “getting over” his wife and kids. It’s recognizing that his wife and kids put him on team globalist by default, which the globalists themselves recognized. That’s why Vance was okay’d at all. If he had native wife and kids and spoke like he did, he would have been no where politically.That said I agree with Citizen of a Silly Country that it might be a help in this situation. If he’s ready to burn it all down too, recognizing what it is as an insider and outsider, then let’s not look the gift horse in the mouth.

                    “as it exists now and what it will become in the future.”That Jewish dream of turning humanity into a light shade of brown for the sake of peace is a nightmare dished up straight from Hell. Race mixing produces children, thus it has the active will of God. However, I tend to think that God likes His actual diversity. That He in fact is not dreaming of a future where all of humanity has become the equivalent of a  sad and boring gray play-dough blob from being overmixed. Thus I’m not losing sleep about that future either.Meanwhile on a personal level race mixing can be very hard on all parties: wives/husbands/children and extended families. There happy families of course, but race mixing increases dramatically the chances of unhappiness and divorce. It certainly decreases immediately the chance for tissue donations. Sometimes stupid backward racists might have point about some issues.

                    For the most part, all you need to do is to stop glorifying race mixing with every shampoo ad and entertainment product (thanks jews).  Let the racial chips fall where they may, and I bet you will see a reversion to the mean of the early 20th century – some interracial couples, but rare.  They may not be vilified as before, but will not be celebrated as much as ignored, tolerated or pitied.

        i think the DOGE whiz kids are just a cover for the real source of discovery; Peter Thiel and Palantir software.   This technology was used in Iraq for similar purposes, to find networks of support for the Iraq regime’s resistance.  Maybe it is the DOGE boys driving this software, but i think it is pretty much automatic at this point. Oh, and guess who was in the Paypal “mafia” when Thiel was the CEO/founder of Paypal?  here’s a hint, his initials are E.M.

            eh, you’re giving this far more credit than it’s due.  It’s a data integrator — you connect to a lot of different data sources, pull data from those sources, use pyspark to transform the data into coherent datasets.  Not revolutionary, but usually better than whatever the gov was using before (a low bar). but it’s not magic.
are they using Palantir software?  yeah, maybe, it’d certainly make their jobs easier.  But, it can’t be that difficult to go thru the database of payments in Treasury, locate fat payments, and identify what they’re for.  It’s not rocket science.

        I expect the primary aims of the Trump administration’s “DOGE” effort to be successful because of who is backing it and the weight they carry. Remember who was sitting in the row behind the Trump family at the inauguration. The meme that this is all being done by Musk and his merry band of 20 year olds seems to be effective, but this effort is much larger than that and has the planning and organization of some very heavy hitters behind it. Some known, some not. Trump is just the front man, he couldn’t have organized this. The 20 year olds may be the tip of the spear, but they didn’t come up with all this by themselves.The question then is, what are their primary aims? I’m pretty sure they are not acting purely out of a sense of selfless civic duty or concern over constitutional issues. I strongly suspect there is also something else going on here. But I am sure they have planned how to deal with the sort of opposition they are now getting.The question of whether and how much DOGE should ignore the judges’ farcical “rulings” comes down, ultimately, to how much of the senate would vote to convict on impeachment charges for violating those rulings. And I would bet all kinds of money they can’t get to 2/3. But I expect the DOGE plan has all kinds of end arounds, and doesn’t require as much computer access, or for as long, as one might think. It is a technologically driven effort that no doubt possesses technological capabilities that regular folks would struggle to understand.

            The blitzkrieg attack and the granular strategy is amazing. Some of the D.C. circuit judges are such hacks and morons they may order checks to be cut, and that would likely be the most expedited appeal ever since it would mean the order would be ignored and as such receive popular acclaim. Those who formulated this plan may be malign actors in some ways to be revealed in the future, but we still will benefit from what they are doing. These NGO’s were major players in bringing aliens to our shores to rape and murder, and bankrolled BLM.As an aside but related in an odd way, can you imagine being one of the FBI agents who rifled through Melania’s undie drawer? The Regime always viewed the DOJ/FBI foot soldiers as expendable and hated them, but that appears to have been not appreciated and is about to brought home. The best sacrifice pawns are the ones that think they are key players.

            The most credible answer to “who’s behind the scenes?” I’ve read, at least that resonates with me, is that some members of the Plutocracy (i.e. Musk and his allies) during the Biden Regency had grown concerned, with good reason, that the Left had gotten loose of its chain and posed an existential threat to many Western intuitions. Up till then the Plutocracy had been on board, as long as they were getting their cut. But if entire systems collapse, so does their income stream. Thus the backing of the current Trump “reformation,” an attempt to reign in the worst of the lunacy of the past four, fifteen, choose your own number, of years.

        I don’t think Trump of his people have the intentions or the cajones, but an outright coup is needed to dissolve the fake govt and imprison the lot.  Because “our democracy” has been a malicious hostile tyranny for decades and there is no good faith; they are enemies.
A king is needed to sweep it all aside so there are no more blocks to getting rid of govt waste/criminality/rackets; eliminating taxes, bringing in bitcoin, no more birthright citizenship, deporting, clearing away rotten city infrastructure, you name it.  Bukele has the right idea.

        Lawfare is playing dirty, and it will not be beaten by pussyfooting cucks kowtowing to the charade of fairplay. Declare a national emergency (epidemic of corruption that threatens the existential viability of the Federal Government) and then move ahead with what must be done despite any court order to the contrary. If the Left pisses and moans, ask “how many divisions does the Pope have?” Exposure is the ultimate vindication.

        Supposedly the judge heard the DOGE-blocking complaintex parte.
That means no one from the Trump administration was present to even hear the complaint much less offer a rebuttal.
To my simple mind, that sounds like a total lack of representation. Such lack of representation makes it seem like this politically-motivated judgment can be ignored.

        Another question the USAID brouhaha brings up is, what happens to the migration and resettlement NGOs?
Noem as head of HomeSec can put the kibosh on Mayorkas’ border scheme and Mayorkas’ direct involvement in the Darien Gap migrant crossing facilities (as well as the proposed highway to cross the dangerous Gap.)
I’m also guessing that’s a large part of the Panama Canal play; Trump is telling Panama to play ball on the Gap (which included a seperate Chinese military camp), or we’ll firebomb the capitol like we did when Bush shut up his drug mule Noriega.

        “This is fundamentally a political dispute, and the court prefers to stay out of those.”But the best part about these lawsuits is that they’re not trying to resolve a political dispute.  One is about whether an inferior court can impose rules on the President.  Only SCOTUS is a coequal branch.  Another is about a specific interpretation of 14A and the INA (neither of which allow the modern interpretation of “birthright” citizenship as extended to illegals).  They’re almost all an attack by the bureaucracy against Trump.I think the Court is going to be eager to bring about the end of “Lawfare”.For his part, Trump needs to get DOJ and IRS involved to tie up the lawyers by putting them in legal jeopardy.
