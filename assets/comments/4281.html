        I am looking forward to the boys at VOX explaining how America is not a functioning democracy because we don’t allow illegal aliens to vote.The United States functioned as a functioning democracy for almost 100 years as a slave-holding nation.The United States functioned as a functioning democracy for somewhat longer while denying women the right to vote.The boys at VOX seem to think that Netanyahu’s warning to his voters that the opposition was coming out to the polls in droves, and that they had better do the same, was somehow anti-democratic.After Netanyahu’s anti-democratic and racist coup, the Arab-opposition parties increased their seats in the Knesset.The Arab-opposition parties in Israel are, uh, Arab.  One of the member parties of the Joint List is called United Arab List.  If Likud changed its name to United Jew List, would that be considered anti-democratic and racist?Likud won the election because right-wing voters abandoned the smaller right-wing parties and voted for Likud.  Arab voters responded to GOTV efforts by the (Anti) Zionist Union and the Obama administration by voting for Arab parties, which hurt the (Anti) Zionist Union.  Why aren’t Tzipi Livni and Isaac Herzog of (Anti) Zionist Union decrying this racist, anti-democratic betrayal by Arab voters?A simple solution to the Palestinian problem.  Institute mandatory genetic testing for all Palestinians within greater Israel.  Those whose genes show that they are descendants of Arabs who emigrated to Palestine after the time of the conquest should be deported.  Those whose genes show that they are descendants of Jews who converted after the conquest may either convert back to Judaism and stay, or leave.That should account for around 90% of the “problem”, and allow Israel to remain blissfully democratic.  As for the “mandatory” part of the genetic testing, I don’t think that even the boys at VOX can complain after the hometown imposition of the individual mandate.

        You had a really brilliant insight in your Homintern piece. We are going through a mass religious conversion like the ones the Scandinavian countries experienced in the Middle Ages. It’s not the end of an era, it’s the end of a world. Reading Erik the Red’s Saga or the Greenland Saga gives you some feeling of what we are going through now.  I now wonder whether Erik was running from legal troubles or Christendom.  Jovian and Hypatia come to mind as well. All tragic figures struggling to come to grips with the end of a system of thought and belief.

        “The Catholic Church is going through similar process and may be facing a schism.”This was true before the heretic Francis and so now there are two likely schisms. Onene will be when the American Catholic Church is established, which to me, seems almost certain (democrat catholics can’t go to hell). The  second will be between the sedevacantists and the heretical band now in charge…

            NYC is having internal Catholic drama that’s a big enough deal that I heard it mentioned at a sermon in Seattle at a fairly orthodox parish when I was there on a business trip.Dolan, naturally, wants to spend most of his time kissing up to Obama and being a popular media figure. He moved Fr. George Rutler, one of the most orthodox priests across town to Hell’s Kitchen from Church of Our Savior. The new Father at CoOS discontinued Latin mass, and promptly removed a lot of the Church’s icons with no real explanations.Meanwhile, the archdiocese decided to “consolidate” parishes on the West Side, pushing St. Michael’s (Fr. Rutler’s new home) and Holy Innocents (the only daily Latin Mass in NYC) to be consolidated into St. Francis’ parish as part of the Making All Things New campaign. (That’s not totalitarian at all!) Holy Innocents and Fr. Rutler are both outspokenly traditional and thriving parishes. (You can’t swing a rosary at a weekday mass at Holy Innocents without hitting a couple pregnant ladies; the liberals must be terrified.) St. Francis is literally a gay church, as in rainbow altar runner. This effort failed, for now, but this is going to end messily.http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/traditional-catholics-perplexed-over-n.y.-parishs-rumored-closinghttp://wdtprs.com/blog/2014/11/manhattan-nyc-holy-innocents-to-remain-open/Pittsburgh is having similar drama. The one Latin Mass community (which does not have its own church and has been on sufferance at St. Boniface’s for a decade) produces more vocations that the rest of the city COMBINED, and Pittsburgh has a huge Catholic population.It’s going to end in a messy schism at this rate, and, given the value of Church property, especially in Manhattan, there will probably be lawsuits.
