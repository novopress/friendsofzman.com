        Democracy, communism and globalist oligarchy are diabolical ideologies that have no place in civilized society.  Like Judaism, Islam and LGBTQism they are heresy and the work of the devil..

        The Swedish election was interesting for a reason the media isn’t covering. The turnout of Muslims was smaller than normal. They vote for the ruling party but are mad about some immigration restrictions and the reluctance to make Sweden more sharia friendly.This is a delimma much of the European left is going to have to cope with. The Swedish left has been flooding the country with Muslims while turning the country into a feminist and homosexual paradise. As we know, that is not a compatible mix.Muslim leaders have said that many Muslims sat out the election to make a point. Reportedly, that made the difference in the close election. Essentially they did what Z and other pundits in the DR have been encouraging in the US. Unfortunately this probably won’t work as well in the US because the right isn’t highly organized like the Muslims and are not a protected group that can’t be canceled.

            I have been to Italy 28 times. My wife and live in Florence for as much as 20% of the year. I love the country, the people, the culture, and teaching my American students while they are there with me about the incredibly rich Western cultural heritage, born there more than anywhere else, is an astonishing privilege. I long had thought they were a great people who had determined to commit suicide.But Meloni is electrifying and appears to be quite fearless.Maybe I have been mistaken!

        For Christ sake.
When Trump was elected, the election was supposedly “stolen”, therefore the dirt was on The magic Kenyan.
When President Pedo was elected, the election was clean as a whistle.
Therefore elections under Dens dirty, under Trump clean.
Does everyone now get it??
Sarcasm.

        “The 2016 election was rigged while the 2020 election was the most bizarrely pure result ever.”There actually was fraud in 2016, the Dems cheated against Trump, but they just didn’t cheat enough. Hence, the full court press vote fraud of 2020 to make sure underestimates of how much fraud was necessary could be remedied with little trouble electronically after the polls closed.I saw a video of Detroit Africans doing a recount after the 2016 election. The precinct had its ballots in 5 sealed boxes. They opened the first up and counted them all and there were slightly more ballots cast than there were registered voters in the precinct, most but not all for Clinton. One of the Dems, probably a state or country level operative and not a local dimwit, realized that it would be unwise to open more boxes while cameras were running, providing hard evidence of what I am certain is pedestrian business-as-usual fraud in Detroit. They shut it all down.Electronic and mail-in vote fraud is SO much easier to hide. Those poor local Democrat operatives have been made obsolete once again by the march of technology.

        For those lovers of democracy in the EU it looks like Orban is about to give it to them as Mencken said “good and hard”.Orban has announced a referendum on Russian sanctions in Hungary.nordot.app/947159765949988864If a couple of others follow suit its going to undercut the EU puppets directly and entrap them in their oqn rhetoric (not that the lugenpress will mind and just write lies anyway) but still its a step forwards in ramming the democratic ideal down their throats.I would hope he is doing this with a couple of other nations onboard, but I am struggling to see who else is not a complete puppet.

            The true test of Hungarians and the European right in general is how they respond to the cutbacks in EU funding. Do they reluctantly bend over and take it from the EU, accept a far lower level of government spending and fewer jobs in other EU countries or do they breakaway and join the other block (which would be the best longterm play).

            You’re missing one thing though: They don’t care about the results of actual votes. If the Hungarians vote against Russian sanctions, they’ll either A) call it a fraud vote, and accuse Hungary of rigging the election. Or B) say that the vote underscores some kind of “backsliding” into authoritarianism. The people in the hive then just believe it.

        There sure is a lot of comment space taken up in D-Right forums about Voting Doesn’t Matter. It gets a bit monotonous.  But I guess since the topic of elections is the foundation for how to speak about other issues, there’s no avoiding it. Still, after about 10 years of Voting Doesn’t Matter becoming a buzz-take, it’s all kinda become a fog of opinion:DaveInDenver: “(News event) just proves what I’ve been telling all of you for a long time now.  You think you’re gonna vote your way out of this?  I’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.  Hahaha. Vote harder idiots!”BobInBuffalo: “So the Powers that Be trick is working perfectly on people like you.  They got far right-wingers to NOT vote in MASSIVE numbers.  Well played PTB.  Well played.”KennyInKansasCity: “Our host is either a fool or a hypocrite.  He tells us voting doesn’t matter.  But here he is with yet another post about elections.”LemmyInLodi:  “The future is shaped in increments that lead to critical mass…watershed moments.  Does every raindrop count?   Who knows.MasterBloggerInMassachusettes:  “I know I vowed to never again blog about election politics.  But recent events yet again call for an exception today.   But remember, Voting Doesn’t Matter.  But remember, Maybe it Does.TedInTuscaloosa: “Our founding fathers and generations that followed fought and died so we can have a say in our own lives.   It’s called Democracy.   You don’t wanna vote?  Fine.  But you never get to complain about anything ever again.  Just sit on your asses like little brats while real Americans do the work for you.”I guess the Your Vote Doesn’t Matter debate has been going on for a long time.  Since I recall that last example nearly verbatim from a neighborhood dad arguing with other neighborhood dads when I was a kid in ’76.I know we all have opinions.  And a mens’ opinions tend to be strong.  Big counterintuitive statements give us that swift upper-cut to the jaw sensation we like.  Rhetoric is fun.  Just saying.  Live not by mottos.

            The “don’t vote, you can’t complain” crowd are enthralled to the (hypothetical) “social contract” theory.  But there really isn’t one is there?  If so, show me where I signed off on such before being born in the US.
Of course I can complain, I’m subject to the same (corrupt) laws as everyone else—at least schmo’s like me— and besides most complaints from the rank and file fall under the heading of violation of heretofore understood rights already established and agreed upon.

        Does anyone knowledgeable about Italian politics know what any of this Meloni business actually means. What I get is that she’s a rabid Atlanticist, gives vague flowery statements that sound nice but are purposely general and non committal, and Italian politics are notoriously slow and unresponsive.Hexing buzzwords hurled at her aside from the moral crowd, what about it? Some boat stoppages and a deal in Africa I’m guessing is as exciting as it will get.I’ve heard some rumblings about a missed opportunity for a 2/3rd constitutional change majority, but what would they do with it. My stance is Italy is a country with no military, a dependent economy, and is functionally governed as a satrap of the globalist west.

            “Does anyone knowledgeable about Italian politics know what any of this Meloni business actually means.”  What does anything actually mean?  Few on our side are saying the Meloni win is a major game-changer.  So you’re rebutting against a straw man.  The Meloni win is just a nice thing.  Cute little white pill.  In prison you get dessert on Fridays.  Don’t be the guy who says, “I’m not eating it and I’m not impressed. We should get dessert EVERY day.”

                I’m not rebutting a strawman. I’m questioning the very real mass media framing of her as a fascist and far right extremist. I don’t like operating in the establishment’s framework.  It’s also the art of the impossible when the possible isn’t even allowed to be imagined.
I ‘m not part of some global right wing team or even really politically active. I’m just an observer and occasional commentator in the far corners of the net, tucked safely away from normiedom and the masses ( for now).

            Yes anything less than the resurrection of Charles Lindbergh and his retroactive election as president is an abject failure.  We must be careful to view all news as bad news because our enemies never overreach or make even the slightest mistake – whereas we are just big stupid dummies who do everything wrong and no one likes.  Literally everything that can or does or ever has or ever could happen is just exactly what our enemies want so its pointless to hope or work for improvement of any kind.It’s strategically important that we recognize and promise only an unending stream of humiliating losses… this is the way a movement attracts supporters!  People love a hopeless losing cause peopled with an army of passive despair eyores.

            I know a little from some relatives there. They’re about as happy about it as our guys would be if Liz Cheney won the presidency. Whatever the Italian equivalent of “fake and gay” is, that’s their summary.
My assessment from over here would be that the new girl is an excuse for wildly disproportionate repression of “the right” by supranational organizations (and the US gov’t).

                I’m just really questioning her because as far as I understand it, she’s not even willing to touch civil unions  let alone major issues of substance.I really don’t care to cheer for these men and women in suits making money, wining and dining on some broad spectrum. I’ll watch sportsball if I want to see rich people try to get me into the team spirit instead.I like Orban and would vote for him. I’d vote for Gosar and like 7  other republicans.  But I’m also realistic about all their limitations. I’ve been extremely unimpressed with Meloni, ever since I read her Breitbart(?) interview. But I’m not being rhetorical when I say I don’t follow Italian politics much.

        While the elites continue to demand our voters in affirmation of their rule, they work hard to make it more humiliating to do so with every passing year. I saw a picture of that Fetterman guy, who looks like he was carved and placed in front of a medieval church to scare parishioners, giving a speech to a large crowd. He was wearing an oversized hoodie and long athletic shorts of the sort I grew too embarrassed to wear in my late teens. How much contempt must this guy and his handlers have for the people, and how little self-respect does one have to have to vote for a guy who puts on such a display?Politics has become an endless parade of weird freaks with many more on the horizon. It is probably why someone like Gavin Newsom has no chance in electoral politics going forward, there will become a time when being White and handsome makes you unelectable.

        “The reality of Western democracy is that it is a weird form of colonialism where the rulers demand regular affirmation from the ruled. The point of elections is for the people to thank their rulers for their service. The rulers are naturally offended when the voters fail to hold up their end of the bargain. The social compact in Western democracy is that the ruling class commands and the voters obey. Anything else is a threat to our democracy and requires any means necessary to thwart it.”Forget “social compact” this is much more primitive. Last night I happened to be watching a YT video on Bronze Age suzerainty treaties (the model for the whole “Yahweh’s covenant” thing) and they had that same structure.  The conquering king pledges to do this or that to show his magnanimity, but with no actual enforcement mechanism. The conquered pledge to pay taxes, serve in the army, etc. but with swift and brutal punishment specified for any slackness.Elections are like the Knights of Malta sending a jewel-encrusted falcon statue each year to the King of Spain.

        The Roman elites ruled with bread and circuses.
Here in Germany, the EU Parliament provides all the circuses and clown acts we could possibly want.
However it’s quite likely we will actually run out of bread this winter. We will probably have to burn it just to keep warm.

            tashtego: “The covid panic concretely and irrefutably demonstrated that the great majority of people are best suited to subordination”That’s true, but the trends are now heading in opposing directions.The good news, two days ago, was that White births in the USA, from 2020 to 2021, had a year-over-year INCREASE, for the first time in forever [since about thirty years ago].https://robertstark.substack.com/p/new-us-birth-data-vindicates-breederThe bad news yesterday was that in Europe, after the approval of COVID v@xxines for children in May of 2021, excess Child Mortality increased 755%.https://expose-news.com/2022/09/25/755percent-increase-deaths-children-europe/These large scale demographic phenomena are rapidly reshaping the mix &amp; balance of surviving personality types in the White race.White sh!tlib personalities [both in the USA and in Europe] are rapidly either un-breeding or poisoning themselves straight into extinction.As has been said many times here chez Z, the White race which entered Klownworld/He11mouth will not bear much resemblance to the White race which eventually arises from the ruins of Klownworld/He11mouth.

                I believe it is a mistake to resent the majority for their relative deficiency in independence, it makes civilization possible. I’m used to civilization and its virtues are many. I made the assertions above in support of an implicit argument that new leadership is demanded, that those new leaders would be perfectly morally justified to employ the usual methods of installing themselves in power and consolidating their positions, assuming only that they were less rapaciously exploitive and of course innocent of the deliberately genocidal intentions that characterize the GAE regime.

        “Thirty years ago, at the dawn of what we think of as the internet, no one imagined that this amazing new frontier in human interaction would become a tool of oppression wielded by massive corporations. In fact, it was assumed that the internet would break the grip of corporations, special interests, and even governments. People would be free of the gatekeepers who controlled public discourse.”I remember things a lot differently.  I first got off the BBSes and onto the internet around 1995.  Initially there was a lot of optimism, but as more people got on, everything became very cynical.  It got far worse as the AOL people suddenly got an IP address.  But for me, the thing that really drove my cynicism was when the ISPs all disappeared at the turn of the century (around 1999-2001).  I believed firmly the cable companies and phone companies were an excellent strangle point.But some time after that, I really bought the hype and bought into the idea that they either couldn’t or wouldn’t take over.  Brexit and Trump put an end to all that optimism that was widely shared.  That was when they decided that allowing people a say was undemocratic and that having gatekeepers mouth or write the narrative was the only true democratic process.Now my cynicism is firmly back in control.

                The standards committees, which approved anti-populist structures such as cross-site scripting &amp; cross-site cookies on the server side of things, but FORBADE the use of cross-site scripting &amp; cross-site cookies on the browser [client] side of things, bear a great deal of guilt here.Also, javascript and cascading style sheets altered the old static-HTML text-driven Internet [which had been largely the province of literate folk], and transformed it into glorified ta1mudvision for mouth-breathing idiots.Javascript can do some phenomenal things, and it would be sad to have to outlaw it.But javascript &amp; cross-site scripting &amp; cross-site cookies are a recipe for near omnipotent power on the part of the folks who own the servers.Finally, the bulk of the cabling industry settled on a “download-cheap/upload-expensive” hardware structure [something like 80/20 or 90/10 traffic-wise], and that made servers hosted in the privacy of one’s own home much more expensive than they should have been.I.e. the cabling folks decided that the structure of the flow of the bits should much more resemble cable television traffic [99.9999%/0.0001% download/upload] rather than classical POTS telephone traffic [50%/50% download/upload].So, right now, the entirety of both software &amp; hardware regulations &amp; infrastructures are badly stacked against the populace.If you wanna see some oligarch heads explode, then propose a legal ban [with 20 year felony sentencing] on all cross-site scripting &amp; cookies, and on any hardware flow which is designed to produce anything other than 50/50 upload/download ratios of bits.

            Yeah, if there is one thing I remember wrt the early Internet was the thought that such a “weapon” of communication in the hands of the people could not be long allowed.  I was off by a decade or so, but that’s just timing.  What I was really off on—as in completely missed—was that the main enemy of “free” Internet communication would be the large social media corporations rather than the government.  I had assumed these titans of the dot com revolution were hard core Libertarian types and would resist any restrictions as to the technology’s use. Damn naive in retrospect.

                I think, to be fair, they were mostly hard core libertarian types. Reddit, for example used to have some very, VERY “un-PC” subreddits that they kept under the guise of free speech. When confronted with this, they would say they had no right to get rid of it despite their opposition to the content. Then those subreddits started to disappear, people cheered, and that was the beginning of the end. As for what caused the change in heart, well I remember reading an article about Google starting to invest more in lobbying and the like, around the 2010 time period or maybe a bit later. Up to that point, the government was extremely hands-off while the companies were exploding in size and power. Yet, they were scared of crackdowns and investigations – it would not surprise me if there was a quid pro quo arrangement struck around that time. It is obvious today that the success of any given corporation is in large part dependent on their willingness to play ball with the Feds.

                    Unfortunately, there is really no such thing as a “hard core libertarian.”  After all, it’s hard to be a hard-core coward.Just look at how easily ALL OF THEM bend to whatever their leftist masters demand of them.  Look at the LP!  If there were any hard-core “libertarians” of the stripe we may hold in higher regards, the leftists would not be in charge of the LP, despite the mises caucus outnumbering them.  Leftists and cucks.It is no accident that the ONE THING they will defend is their non-aggression “principle”  Because anything that looks like fighting makes the yellow streak running down their backs really noticeable.The “Geeks” had the same exact problem.  They mistook their own cowardice for principled libertarianism.  It is FAR TOO EASY to say “live and let live” when the enemy is gathering.

            I remember when Molyneux was still on youtube he was insistent that in the libertarian utopia order could be maintained by simply ostracizing anyone who violated the law.  So in the libertarian paradise everyone collectively refuses acts in concert to maintain order….makes sense and totally in keeping with real world libertarians whose primary concern is smoking as much marijuana as possible.

                Ostracizing only works on lonely deviants.
When the numbers of misfits reaches a critical level, they form their own self-supporting network totally defanging any power that ostracism has.
It is ironic that libertarians are in fact the lonely deviants who got shunned from society.

        “The reality of Western democracy is that it is a weird form of colonialism where the rulers demand regular affirmation from the ruled.”
Question:  What title do you give yourself for a part-time job where you make a huge salary while all expenses are covered by taxpayers, make millions on inside stock information, phony book sales and speeches, set up family members with corporate no-show jobs/bribes, and set up “charitable” foundations that are slush funds for personal expenses and your entourage of family and consultants?
Answer:  Public Servant.

            To me it looks like an Italian Amy Cohen Barret (or whatever her name is).The manifesto for the alliance is “Italy, fully part of Europe, the Atlantic Alliance and the West. More Italy in Europe, more Europe in the World”.She is a recent member of the Aspen institute, fully supports Ukraine, NATO and the EU,  and has been to CPAC 3 times in the recent past.She even says she intends to be close to the British Conservatives in policy.For the Italians rushing from the fake 5 star to its right mirror image shows like the rest of us they just want change, but can’t work out the table is already rigged.The only hope is that an actual autocratic player comes out from within the ranks of these sort of astroturf orgs once they get traction as a real challenger.

The same scenario has played out throughout the West. To my knowledge, though, the EU didn’t say squat about the Five Star Movement so there’s that. Incidentally, Five Star was founded by a comedian. I don’t know his ethnicity, but we all know the default answer.

        AFAIK, the leaders in the individual EU member states have even less power than the US states have.  Whatever they try to do, the EU courts will undo.Italy is loaded with Euro denominated debt.  The Pound Sterling was Britain’s secret weapon to getting out of the EU. Sweden is another story, but is still heavily tied to the EU and to the Euro.  The EU is not going to allow these countries to leave and remain in the free trade zone.  Their economies are set up for these free-trade deals.  As long as they are member states of the EU, voting is just a waste of time.For all their kvetching about the new 1930s mustache man reincarnated, I don’t think these elections will have any impact on the EU.

            At some point in time, some leader will have to “stay until the end of the movie”.  The reason they’re so worried about Mustache Man is that they’re bound and determined to create him.

        I have a bone to pick with the Taki mag article, which is excellent ZMan. That is that everyone rushed to the center where the moral consensus lies. I think the controllers of the consensus rushed to the far left. I think the reality of the left’s moralizing narrative that presents itself as a moral framework, shows that to be true.There is a reason why this happens. The first slip of morality is that a majority wins and starts to vote away money from the losers. The winners create coalitions of niche vote buying constituencies. For a long time the uni-party called a truce – one getting military largesse to placate working class whites, the other getting welfare state largesse to create a black middle class and placate their underclass. All the while the white majority was stealthily being replaced.A significant chunk of that majority woke up to the Patriotism scam once their son’s service in the War on Terror was clearly the highest form of usury – military service for a lie that they paid for with life and treasure with no reward. Then they watched the state that rallied them to war against radical Islam began busing in radical Islamists into Europe and America.Now the system is in pretty much daily danger of going tits up. The scams and flim-flams to create the illusion of wealth are straining under their own weith. The UniParty runs the golden goose – called the bureaucracy. That is the complex series of siphons that puts the coin in the various constituency’s troughs. Now The Left is done playing nice guy. They have reached out to the other constituencies that were happy with The War On Poverty for seven decades. That isn’t enough to hold center. Now we have anti-white racism, rainbow coalitions, … A coalition of the fringes. That moral framework works the same way the War On Poverty did in terms of cowing its opposition. If you say you think it is wrong – you are immoral because you hate: insertThe moral fall occurred when, as always happens in democracy, the majority decides that stealing from the losers of the plebiscite is a good thing. Now, in a multi-racial and multi-cultural democracy, where racial animosity is exacerbated by the oligarchy to hold on to the power, we are in for a very wild ride down the drain.

Now we have anti-white racism, rainbow coalitions, … A coalition of the fringes.There’s a Karl Popper meme that still makes the rounds online on “The Paradox of Tolerance”, which basically says that in order to have a tolerant society, one has to be subdue the intolerant.  Anyone with half a brain cell will ask the question of who decides who is tolerant, and what is tolerated, which makes the statement more of a ridiculous contradiction than any sort of paradox.The truth is, in order to be tolerant of some things, you must be intolerant of others.  There is no such thing as a society that is objectively tolerant of everything.

        Ultimately, that is why I am a staunch autocrat. I prefer to dispense with the lies and the deceptions and the make believe, and have a single strongman rule the country. Historically, the autocrat stood for the common people against exploitation by the aristocrat class. Here in the democracy, the leader is chosen by the aristocrats, so the commoners have no such champion.

            I tend to agree.  Except the trick is having an autocrat that defends what I value and smash the enemies I hate.  Because now it’s the other way.But it is obvious that people in groups and governments are HOPELESSLY fraught with conflict and corruption.  There is no avoiding that.But if there ever could be just rule again, the real trick would be keeping it by MAKING BETTER PEOPLE.   Nothing is possible without naturally strong people, physically and mentally.James Watson gets it:  ““People say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty.  I think it would be great.”

        There is a fine post today by Ugo Bardi concerning the Italian elections:“The triumph of the right may make people outside Italy worried, but there is no reason. Elections in the West are now mainly for show. The Italian government has almost zero power, it is all in the hands of the European Commission, in turn controlled by the global powers. To say nothing about the pervasive corruption that affects the West as a whole. No decision can be taken without satisfying the various lobbies and mafias engaged in the feeding frenzy on what is left of the Italian economy.”https://www.senecaeffect.com/2022/09/the-italian-election-right-wins-but.html

            The linked piece is quite good, and it is hard to argue that Western elections have become anything more than empty pageants. Still, other than a faux affirmation of the system, they do serve as a gauge as to how much more repression is needed. When results indicate a threat to “our democracy,” the Regime acts correspondingly to oppress the actors and voters who are not with the program. Polling once served to do the same, but given most people are justifiably fearful now of telling an anonymous person what they actually think, elections serve the same purpose to inform the Regime what needs to be done to maintain itself. To some extent, algorithms serve the same purpose.The only actual good that could come from Meloni’s election would be if it forced the EU to act in such a way as to further discredit itself. This seems at least possible. Italy is closer to the UK than to Hungary and Poland in its GDP, and somewhat less vulnerable to pressure from the EU. We’ll see. Bardi’s claim about European backlash against sanctions during the upcoming winter remains in question.

An excellent observation.  Voting not only validates/sanctions this corrupt system but gives lets the system know how much to oppress.
The regime has very quickly went to war against not just Trump, BUT HIS VOTERS as well!

                Agree as to Western elections.  Even pols like Rand Paul, who sometimes make interesting noises, let slip that they are harmless to the system.  Heard him on a talk radio interview where the topic was Fauci, and when asked if such ilk would ever be brought to justice, he diverted and said some nonsense about putting it behind us and focusing on making sure something like that doesn’t happen in the future.
Hey dumbass, you know how you prevent something like a Fauci from happening in the future? By publicly executing the present one – in Minecraft.

                    That’s correct.  What you reward, you get more of.  Look at all these flunkies that TPTB work through—they fail *up*!  Louis Learner uses the IRS against conservative organizations and when her crimes come to light, she retires with full pension, no physical punishment, and I suspect is in demand at  DC cocktail parties.

        Just like everything with the subversive left, they latch onto words that have an emotional effect, then manipulate their meaning to their own needs.– Democracy means subservience to NGOs and political connected elites– Multiculturalism means flattening the wide cultures of Europe by flooding immigrants to turn the continent into a sterile corporate blob– Freedom means degenerates being able to wear a dress in public while curbstomping anyone who wants to live life away from freaks.Honestly the best retaliation is to just accuse the left of immorality using the same tired buzzwords in the most ridiculous contexts.Pride parade?  You hate multiculturalism,Insane police reform laws?  You hate freedom.etc.Make their magic words so without meaning they lose all moral resonance with the average people.

        “The demon of democracy is it leads people to forget this basic reality of life.”
One effective way to manipulate people’s thinking, is to confuse them as to what’s true.
Convince someone that up is actually down, and no matter how smart they are, their reasoning will never come out correctly.
The ongoing effort by progressives to brainwash up-and-coming generations, is an effort to confuse their thinking by programming them with false concepts.
Once a majority of the people becomes convinced that the dogmas of postmodernist progressivism are true, convincing them of other foolish things becomes a lot easier.

                Once they’ve trampled the notion of faith out out of the public consciousness it’s easier to sell each successive panic.  When you have no belief in the afterlife, you’ll do anything they tell you to do so long as it’s pitched as the only method by which you can cling to your life on this planet.

        “Getting back to Ursula von der Leyen, you can be sure she will start pressing the new governments to pray at the feet of the moral consensus. Her primary weapon is financial, which she is now using against Hungary. The voters there support Viktor Orbán, who is no fan of men in dresses chasing girls in public toilets. The EU has thus declared that Hungary is not really democratic, despite their democracy. This means the EU will not begin withholding tens of billions in money.”“Not?” Ursula von Laden in a bout of menses has declared billions will be withheld from both Hungary and Poland. They have told her to shove it where the blood flows.As for Meloni, she has a big card to play–Russian sanctions. She has supported them but her coalition partners want them ended (some energy prices in parts of Italy are almost ten times higher than last year). So Ursula may be told there is no choice other than for Italy to end the sanctions if push comes to shove. Being a woman though, in a fight with another woman, von Laden may not back off even if it begins the overdue dissolution of the EU, which seems a possibility now.

            They have to be at least a little bit careful, or they should be but probably won’t.  Ending financial transfers would remove 90% of the reason those countries even belong to the block.  “No more Euros for you” would be met with “fine then we’ll leave the Euro” which would doom the currency (and which was a big reason they screwed with “democracy” to install a globalist in charge of Italy for these past many years).

                I wish them luck. During the 20th century, the Italian Lira was not exactly known as a reserve currency 🤣 To a large degree, it was the PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain) — nations never known in modern times for their fiscal rectitude — that stood to benefit the most from sucking at the teat, pardon me, participating in the European Union. Perhaps the milk has finally run out, and it’s time to part ways?

                    Parting ways would make sense from both EU and the PIGS—fiscally.  However, the EU desires power and control.  The EU was never intended to be simply a trading block, TPTB saw it as the beginning of the United States of Europe.  Heck, I saw that immediately decades ago.  These guys were the first globalists.So the PIGS see getting out and control of their currency as a way to inflated their way out of debt, whereas the EU sees them as a head count in their march to US of E.  We (DR) see the dissolution of the EU as a set back for totalitarianism, or in our case Federalism.

Virtually no one in the general population gives two craps about the Uke situation, and yet here is the US government declaring it is one of the most critical events ever – if not the most critical, and by God if the world has to burn to save their territorial integrity (and take down the Ruskies), well, that’s too bad now, isn’t it?  Unbelievable.

                Its been green for the past 14 years for no reason at all.  If it actually was a weighing machine like warren buffett famously said it would be much much lower.  Think like 6k or 7k as fair value.  I’ll let you guys in on a little secret.  Do you know how Inflation was brought under control in the 80’s other then high interest rates?  It was the end of pension plans for the masses and the adoption of the 401k.  And it inflated the market to boot!  A win win.  Think about it. 😉

I assume you are referring to the regular 401k contributions and associated conpany matches that regularly enter the market that need to find a home somewhere.

                        I also assume that is what Mr. House meant, and if so, he’s correct. The percentage of Americans who receive traditional pensions is down to 22 percent, and in Europe it only is slightly higher at 26 percent. Eventually, and possibly soon, the State will seize IRA’s and 401K’s (it will be for your protection, of course) and in effect become the largest shareholder in most corporations. It will be another win/win.In addition to these investment instruments replacing traditional pensions, artificially low interest rates have grossly inflated the value of stocks. The allegedly “big” Fed hikes in recent months have started to tank the market, and those rate increases still have left the prime rate at a near-historic low. An unsustainable deficit is among the reasons the rates remain artificially low, but the social unrest that would follow a market that reflected reality also is taken into account.

Nancy Pelosi floated that idea back in 08 but i’m sure no one remembers………..

We’ve had 40 or 50 years of declining rates acting as a tailwind to the stockmarket along with people being forced to gamble in the market for their retirement.  As rates rise asset values must go down and viceaversa.Plus uh, babyboomers retiring will be withdrawing that money out of the market, if they don’t get wiped out by a crash.

Now what is the FED going to be doing with its QT program?  Selling treasuries!  Wouldn’t that serendipitous if they decided to use 401k proceeds just then to buy treasuries?

Stocks might be the cleanest shirt in the laundry basket.  (14 years of low rates and QE isn’t manipulation?)
Perhaps commodities make sense but only those that were valued in the Middle Ages: Wheat/Coal etc.  (I disagree and i think that is why Russia is currently fighting.  They are not going to let the West set the price of what they produce anymore.  Also don’t forget Gold and Silver were money during the Middle Ages)

        I am much amused by the accounts of Meloni’s win. Apparently it’s got all the liberals waving their hankies and screaming “Fascist!!”.
My typical rejoinder to anguished liberals has been, “I’ll start worrying about fascists when I see them putting little boys in dresses and cutting off their dicks. Until then, I’m going to consider this an upgrade.”.
Needless to say, that usually generates some fireworks.

                Yeah I’ve been wondering about all of these women rising up in politics. It’s welcome in the sense that somebody has the balls to put nationalist positions out there, but I suspect it’s fool’s gold. Kind of like women going to work while men were getting killed at the front. You have to admire them for standing in the breach, but long-term is it good? Men gotta suck it up and stand up.

                        At the risk of being crude, men think with their dicks too much. Can’t imagine it’s always been this way, but I wasn’t around to know for sure lol. Controlling the passions is better than living in Africa, right?

        It has become trite to point out that the lovers of democracy have a one way relationship with it. When the results of an election are favorable to the ruling class, they praise democracy. When the results are something other than what the rulers wanted, then you can no longer trust the process.
Or worse. They make placards and giant paper mache dolls and bother normal people in the street.
Either you vote or you protest. You can’t have both because when you cast your vote, you agreed to the rules of the game.

            Felix:  Beautifully and succinctly put:  ” . . . when you cast your vote, you agreed to the rules of the game.”This is what today’s excellent post by Zman, and so many earlier ones, have been trying to convey.  But still we get “but the local school board” or “but the local police”  or “but I’ll vote for ‘x’ and that’ll make the elites go reeee” ad nauseam.  Or we see impassioned calls for public protests or morality parades because a sea change will occur when “We the people” suddenly somehow   all notice the men behind the curtain.Obviously I agree with you and with Zman, and full credit to Zman for his ability to continue to try to write the truth in the face of so much residual attachment to various elements of system.  I get it; it’s what we all grew up with and all we know.  The thought of either tipping over the game board or just walking away is not merely terrifying – it is literally unthinkable to many.  Thus refusing to participate in the game is termed ‘despair’ or ‘fear porn.’Whatever.

Those are best case scenarios when individuals or voting blocs threaten “our democracy.” Outright violence and financial ruin are Our Democracy’s Little Helper now. Same old same old.

            I wonder a lot about protests that we see in the modern world.It seems to me they sort of arose from post WW1 as a stage managed behavior patterning for things in the recent past that the borg wanted done in advance.So you create your protest movement and then give in the policy decision you already had decided upon. Anti-nuke, Feminism, etc, etc.Its a just a more theatrical form of a something the UK and other govts do all the time, which is set up an org to sue itself to get a policy change that cannot be done in voting.Now, genuine opposition follows this pattern they have seen on the media believing it actually worked as a thing.This obviously does not work for those who try and use these against the pre-defined policies as those just get crushed by riot police.Earlier times, protests were a lot more kinetic and dangerous to authority vectors. Maybe we will see a return.

                The January 6 “insurrection” was very mildly kinetic and the State murdered some of the people involved and many charged with basically misdemeanors remain in the gulag. It would not hesitate to kill thousands if a protest actually could effect even minimal change.

                    Yeah I get that.
I was more wondering when people realize that they are trying to use a behavior that was fake, scripted and pre-defined to appear effective for things the govt wanted to change will not work for things people want to change, but the govt does not.
At that point you are back to the sort of massive riots in the 17th/18th century and earlier that often involved the need for troops.

            I don’t recall anyone loudly proclaiming that BO’s elections were rigged.  In 2008, McStain was so bad that many GOPers were ambivalent.  I didnt vote in 2008.  In 12 it was all about the black woman vote that nobody saw coming.  They rallied for their race and Mittens was history.  Voter fraud was not a thing.

                He didn’t quite word his statement correctly, so I think a lot of people missed his point.
Obama was the sitting president overseeing the 2016 election, which is what the dems claim as rigged.
Meanwhile, Trump was the sitting president for the 2020 election, which they claim was the most secure and believable ever.

Romney won hands down. The debate was embarrassingly one sided.

            I see your point. Ever since the 2000 election, every election has been “rigged” depending on which team you’re on. I don’t think anyone doubted the 2008 results, but there were doubts for every other one, and the doubts were amplified in the various red team or blue team media outlets. Though things have clearly become hot and heavy since 2016. I don’t think election results will ever be trusted again fully, by the team not in power. Though I do think if a right-winger wins the presidency, the left will be allowed to do all the J6 stuff they want.

                First off there are no “right wingers” any more.  Anyone to the slightest right of the radical left is considered “extreme” and a “clear and present enemy of the state”.   That’s why now they just run them down with their car and kill them or shoot them on the street when they are canvassing.
