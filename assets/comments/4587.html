        Now Ferguson protesters are protesting over not getting paid:“Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment (MORE), previously known as the Missouri Branch of Acorn is now dealing with members of “Black Lives Matter” who were being paid $5,000 a month to protest in Ferguson (Plus all the TVs and Doritos they could carry) who haven’t received their pay for the last couple of months.  Now they have parked themselves in front of MORE’s offices and are using the hashtag #cutthecheck. MORE, Open Society and other organizations received millions from George Soros according to Front Page magazine.”What a farce, every burned-shop owner should sue him personally.And Z, you got to check outBaltimore’s Violence Guy, the ground zero blog.

        Blacks have rejected the “talented ten percent” ;  Thomas Sowell,  Ben Carson, Charles Paine etc., for the  raucous rabble rousers Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton,  and a slew of black commentators in the media.  Victim-hood is preached as the new gospel with whites being the devil.  Many talented blacks do achieve success and many  average black folks work in business and government and make reasonable livings, but the ghettos of America are boiling cauldrons of ignorance, ineptitude, crime, hate and sloth and exploited by other blacks (and some whites)  for gain.  I can’t say what will cure the problem but I know the progressive model does not work.  We need new thinking.
