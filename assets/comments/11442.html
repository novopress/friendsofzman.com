        The provocateur often shows prescience in describing elements of the future.  Kesey’s Nurse Ratched keeps running for president.
The Left’s favorite provocateur of the hour is Margaret Atwood and her Handmaid’s Tale.  It perfectly predicted the rise of the fundamentalist Muslim culture that the Left is so in love with today.  The cognitive dissonance, it burns!

        The Stormers, Richard Spencer, and the former Occupy/Obama guy that organized the flytrap in Charlotte have done an amazing job of exposing the madness of the left.  The effort to make racism seem the epitome of sin failed miserably – first because so few people stood with the LARPers, second because so many leftists and Democrats and GOPeanuts stood with the psychotic Black Block.Racists – in all flavors – are usually dumb, and it doesn’t take long to figure that out.  But they aren’t violent except in extreme circumstances.  Leftists, on the other hand, are always about revolution – constant and unrelenting.  They sow chaos so they can create a world that is always needing an iron fist to impose order.It’s been an illuminating few months as that dynamic – the impotence of the racists, and the danger posed by the revolutionaries – has been clarified, even as the media and most of our elected Representatives have worked hard to make the opposite case.

                That remark needs a little clarification. Do you mean racism in general or can you be more specific. God knows there’s a lot going around, but it isn’t unidirectional by any means!

                    It could be the kind of racism whereby 50 percent of rapes of white women are perpetrated by blacks and, according to the FBI, the number of white on black rapes rounds down to zero.

                People that think the race defines the individual.  Won’t hire a qualified black guy with good references because he’s black.  Think all white people are rich and privileged.  Think all Hispanics are lazy.Basically, anyone that tars the individual with the stereotype.  Not saying the stereotypes aren’t largely accurate (they are a useful shorthand), but if you refuse to at least give a listen to someone like Thomas Sowell, Hernando De Soto (the living economist, not the dead Conquistador), Nicholas Nassim Taleb, or Spinoza because they are (in order) black, hispanic, Lebanese, and Jewish, then your opinion is too simple and reductionist to be worth consideration.Of course, if you are in law enforcement and you aren’t racist, you’re an idiot and likely to be killed.  Not all instances of racism are dumb.

                    “Not all instances of racism are dumb,” and “racists-in all flavors-are usually dumb,”  seem to be a bit contradictory, but, I can live with it.I appreciate you taking the time to give me a detailed answer.

        Meanwhile,  Congressional GOP establishment lifers quietly sit by and rub their hands under the table with glee.  This silent censorship is just what their doctor ordered to start removing their critics from the spotlight.   Ah if we could only turn the internet into television from the 60’s, before cable,  where there were 3 major networks,  some local indies ant the occasional UHF station if you had enough tin foil on the internal antenna and the moon was at crescent.   The news was so easy to control then.
Oh wait,  we are already moving in that direction!  My bad!

        There was a bizarre brilliance to The Daily Stormer, that so many missed, which was unfortunate. Anglin spent a long time studying how to defang the cherished taboos of the holocaust, feminism, racism, etc., for the Gen Z crowd, and they were who he wrote his blog for, not an older audience, who just didn’t always get it. I remember the first time I stumbled across it, being taken aback, but after spending a few days acclimating myself to the writing, I caught on to the tone of it, and understood the purpose of its harshness was not to just be crass, but to drive a mack truck thru these sacred cows. It became one of my favorite places to visit for a good laugh. because once you understood The Stormer, you understood just how hilarious it really was.

            Anglin’s humor was a bit too much on the sociopathic side even for me, but he is an effective canary in the coal mine. If the corporations/government/whoever is effective in shutting him down, that sets a precedent. If they can get away with it this time, they’ll be a lot less bashful employing that tactic again. If they can get away with taking an inch, the next time they’ll go for the whole mile.

        There is however a huge difference between the Establishment and the Dissidents. The Establishment can rely on the Press to smother any mention of anti-fa lunacy and extreme anti-White hatred. While it can also rely on Anglin and the rest posting Nazi stuff and various depictions of Jews out of Goebbels to be amplified to anyone to the right of Pol Pot.This is reality, and we on the Dissident side have to deal with this reality, pretending won’t make it go away.My solution is for the Dissident Right to embrace Bibi-ism; and talk about how awesome Israel is for having a Wall, deporting Africans, having Israel for Israelis, being explicitly Jewish, and how America should be JUST LIKE ISRAEL.We have to stand for something, might as well be that. Normies like Israel and since Normies are the strategic high ground the Establishment and Dissidents are fighting for; best to choose things that Normies like (Israel, a border wall, strong nationalism, strong religious orientation in public life, defense of its people, etc) instead of stuff Normies don’t like: Hitler, Hitler, Nazis, killing inoffensive White people for being Jews, etc.You can’t go wrong with the American Flag, and you can never go right with the Nazi one.

            So, to avoid being defamed by the Jewish media you have to say how great the Jews are?
Now, who would the main beneficiaries of that strategy be?

                It’s brilliant – somebody set Whiskey up with another round! Bile is buying!Bibi is hated with the heat of 1000 suns by the Marxist Jewish media slobs. Doing as Whisky suggests wouldA. Ally us with some very powerful and intelligent friendsB. Drive a wedge into our enemies and isolate Jewish media slobsC. Undermine the common charges against the dissident right such as anti-semitism and fascism.The Alt Right tried to use fascists as useful fools the same way the left uses turd-brained proggies and the strategy clearly failed.Now consider: how about we poach some of the allies of ‘the dissident left’? We’re talking about the skilled, high IQ moderates that are getting run out of their own party by low IQ vibrants and ethnics who are too stupid to see their value?Hell! I am going to buy a round for Whisky too!

            The Normies becoming Shabbos Goyim and “liking” Israel and the Jews, and allowing Jews to dictate our foreign policy, is how we ended up in the situation we are in, in the first place. I fail to see how making ourselves into a tribe of pseudo Shabbos Goyim to appeal to Normies while touting the policies of Israel gets us out of our present day problems, but it may come to that. We can get Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity to lead us, I guess.

        Z man, I’m shocked that you overlooked what is by far the greatest influence Kesey had over society: he single handedly emptied the state mental institutions putting them permanently out of business with the popularity of his book and subsequent film. Lo and behold, by the next decade the “homeless problem” was suddenly caused by Reagan’s heartless conservative policies, not liberals swinging open the gates of mental institutions for the inmates to roam the streets.

        Nancy Pelosi proved an important point when she said something like “you can’t just cry ‘wolf’ in a crowded theater.”  There really is no “debate” going on in the U.S. concerning free speech.You are correct in saying that policing speech has been outsourced to the big corporations, but it is really nothing new, and it actually includes outsourcing most of the social change the left desires. For example, I remember more than 30 years ago AT&amp;T began celebrating the gay agenda, and any complaint from employees earned them a quick trip to the re-education camp.  Corporate “leadership” on social issues is one of the main reasons the Left loves big corporations. Most of the re-education of America has come from citizens just trying to keep their jobs and not make waves at the workplace.  Civic changes usually follow the corporate lead, rather than the other way around.

            “Reeks of boomer” good insight. VD is still fighting his father’s old fights to a certain extent. I can see that because I did the same thing for a while. Part of being an adult is being able to bury hatchets from a generation or two back. A lot of what happened then has become irrelevant and not pertinent to being able to function in the present. Honoring your father and mother does not extend into participating in their personal tempers and petty irrationalities.

        I think the self-styled “alt-lite,” is expending too much energy on the fringe of the “alt-right,” because they have otherwise run out of things that feel close to being under their control. That’s understandable with Trump waffling on so many issues and controversial speakers being blamed for riotous behavior on the left; however, there was never anything to gain by trying to strike at the internet nazis or tell them they aren’t right-wing. They don’t care about decorum and have even less respect for political dipoles.Yes, Anglin’s tabloid is a gadfly. Every political and social movement has theirs. Israel has plenty of right-wing loons who like to quote the Talmud saying gentiles are all cattle fit for servitude, but if we wasted time trying to shut those people up, we’d never have a moment to spare for the regular listener and reader who wants to know what the rest of us are about. Don’t punch the tar-baby if you don’t have to, the briar patch is easily avoidable.

        When someone loses their marbles over being mocked by an Andrew Anglin, they inevitably say and do things that reduce their status in the eyes of the public. Don’t be that guy…I assume this rather opaque statement refers to the bizarre behavior of Ted Beale (the LARPing Dark Lord of his very own Slytherin House of Dreadsome Dorks, or whatever they’re called), who’s been acting strangely since Charlottesville (with his weird tirades about Taiwanese National Socialists and “Nazis are the real leftists” and whatnot) and who recently seems to have gone completely off the rails (“By Grabthar’s hammer, sirrah, if you don’t immediately give me the names, addresses and shoe sizes of those two malefactors who besmirched the reputations and/or good names of both myself and the missusbunny, you’ll be hearing from Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger… and McCormick. Or did I leave out a Hungerduner?”).If have something to say on the matter, you should be more direct about it.

            No, I think he’s right to not address it directly. Attacking VD’s crowd is just more infighting; he’s been effective at relaying things to me in the past and I’d just prefer he’d drop this insane crusade to purity spiral “the alt right.” Hopefully, he realizes that this is stupid and moves on as if this never happened. I doubt he’ll admit he was out of his mind, especially on that crazy legal battle with gab, but maybe he can at least pretend this was all part of some master plan and drop the thing entirely.

                If this is so, misunderstanding is what will come of not speaking directly. Certainly, on the day of the great Anglin vs. Beale “debate” on whatever it was they were talking about, what you say here doesn’t bring Google or even Cloudflare to mind.

                        Something weird is going on with VD/TB. There’s lots of speculation about what’s motivating him, but I have no idea what’s behind it and I expect nobody apart from him really gets it (and probably not even him). It’s sort of amusing to spectate from afar but it’s pointless to get directly involved. It really is a cult-like atmosphere over at his site, and it’s pretty strange to see the Anglin-types who comment there coming off looking like the rational ones.

This fool’s extremes are tolerated because, after all, he is just a fool, as he gets away with gutting the virtue signalers to their hypocritical core.

        This is where the “Facebook is a public utilty” argument fails, I think.  I can get fired for writing “Donald Trump is a Nazi!” all over my employer’s intranet.  I can win a Pulitzer for writing “Donald Trump is a Nazi!” all over the New York Times’ editoral page (also known as the “news” section).  Can the NY Times refuse to sell me a paper if I write letter after letter to the editor claiming “Donald Trump is a Nazi!”?  If Faceberg can’t police speech under “terms of service” because they’re a public utility, is the NYT forced to print my letters?Folks are tempted to say this is an apples to oranges comparison, because print vs. digital, but the 1st Amendment doesn’t specify any particular technology (I’m free to write “Donald Trump is a Nazi!” all over the pages of my self-xeroxed fanzine that I hand out at the hardware store, too).  And, as the judges constantly remind us, the Constitution is a “living document.”  I hate the “term of service” loophole, too, but I don’t see how to get around it by regulating Faceborg as a public utility.  If it is, so is the NYT, Fox News, and (probably) this blog (and mine).

            That’s not really the issue though. If Anglin goes on FaceBorg and starts his act and is booted, that’s a different thing than having his site seized by the registrar. That’s like having your car repossessed because you put a Trump sticker on it and the loan company was backing Hillary.
Now, as far as how to handle the oligopoly, I would be all for breaking up companies like Google and preventing FaceBorg from meddling in competing media. We learned this lesson a century ago. No need to relearn it the hard way again.

                Z Man;Absolutely_!  We need to use anti-trust to the max against the tech oligarchs.  Two reasons: First, to re-establish deterrence against making everything political; Second, it puts sand in their gears.In my biz experience, the best way to slow down a bad acquisition was to bring up ant-trust law in the meeting.  Anti-trust law is a mess of contradictory cases and vague statuary law.  The slick power points go in the trash bucket while the corporate law-dawgs proceed to fillet all the cool concepts.  It’s a joy to watch if you think the underlying idea sucks.  If it’s your idea, not so much.

            My med school psychiatric rotation was at a VA psychiatric hospital that also served as a TB sanitarium and alcohol and drug rehab facility. Learned a lot about syphilis there. It looked just like the place in that movie, and there were characters in it that were similar, too.The head shrink was a guy who was a truck driver before going to med school. One of my classmates was interviewing a new admission and the guy punched him in the face. A bunch of us trapped the bastard behind a mattress and got him in a strait jacket. While all this was going on a background check came in and it turned out that the guy had checked himself in to hide from the law. Outstanding warrants. Had been arrested and escaped by setting his bed on fire.When we took him down to the head dude he started begging not to be released. Said he was acting out b/c he hadn’t been taking his ” medication”.The head dude said, “Bullshit. You’re nothing but a common criminal.” Then he looked at the armed guards and said, “Take him out on the beltway and drop him off someplace.”He didn’t want to bother with the paperwork and take the time to testify in court, and he knew that someone would render better justice to the guy outside the system rather than in it.

        I would argue that provocateurs like Anglin are a sideshow that obscures (rather than highlights) the deeper and more serious problem of the methodology that has been employed to bring about the demise of free speech. It’s not just the tyranny of the mass media oligarchs that has brought this upon us, but also the complicity of the other institutions that remain silent or stay on the sidelines. The culture of freedom that birthed this country is diseased and growing weaker by the day.

            One reason I always respected Kesey was that he was a genuinely tough guy in real life. He was All American wrestling in college, as was his son. His son was a division 1 wrestler and he died on the way to or from a wrestling tournament with his team, if I remember correctly.Losing a child is devastating for parents, and Kesey wrote lovingly about his lost child. Some fellow travelers say Kesey was never the same after the loss.

        Z Man;Hate to partially disagree, but It is pragmatically important to distinguish between a  basically harmless-but-annoying ‘jester’ (like Ken Kesey) from a deeply dangerous ‘provocateur’. Kesey (hadn’t thought about that guy for 45 years) was essentially a jester, as you presciently point out.  Maybe Anglin is one too, don’t know.But Kessler, the guy who organized the Charlottesville fly trap operation, was a true provocateur.  And we need to be very wary of such.  I guess anybody who has not been made acquainted with the old history of commie techniques and counter-techniques, via the required study once required of US officers in the ’60s &amp; early ’70s, for example, might miss the differentiation.In historical parlance, still relevant today, a provocateur in state (or state-sponsored  NGO) employ is somebody who seeks to deflect a dissident group from their own aims into aims convenient to the state in order to either crush, neutralize or even convert them to state use.  And also to entice the more unstable members of such groups into legally chargeable offenses: Just as a matter of deterrence if legal decapitation is not possible.The FBI employs numerous provocateurs against the jihadi’s in situ in the US (thanks Cloud People) and I’m glad that they do.  That’s where the largely buried MSM stories about ‘jihadi plots foiled’ come from.  To expect that they are  not doing this against Alt-whatever groups at the behest of their Cloud Folk masters is beyond naive.So, watch out.  The guy agitating for the most extreme, clearly illegal, measures today is likely to be a jammed up junkie looking to put your pelt on the cabin wall to keep his own ass out of the joint.

        Z, I’d appreciate it if you could analyze and opine at some point on the position Ward Connerly took in his initiatives for color-blindness in state hiring, contracting, and university acceptance.  Seems to me your thoughts on that point of view would be relevant to the opinion formation that’s happening here.I remember ringing doorbells with petitions for that initiative back in the day.  About half the homes I visited were willing to sign; those who declined were mostly polite.  The initiative got to the ballot and was actually voted into law here.Of course that law’s intent has been diluted and subverted over the years, as you might expect — largely, I think, because there is no respectable, credible, sustained organization fighting to maintain and advance it.I mention this because your ‘provacateur’ article analyzes an extreme end of things.  That’s a good thing to do.  It might also be good to analyze the moderate end.  There’s a spectrum in all of this where people are trying to get oriented and find their place.  Thanks.

            Connelly was a hero to me at one time. He was a visionary and could see where things were going to to go with the early anti-white bias and the backlash that would ultimately result. I haven’t thought about him in some time. Apparently he’s still alive, but at 78, not as active.
One thing is evident from watching that whole thing play out: moderation doesn’t produce results. You set your goal far beyond what you want, then maybe you get what you want.
That’s the Art of the Deal.
Robert Mugabe and Trump are actually the same man.

                “…: moderation doesn’t produce results. ”Perhaps.It’s not necessarily either-or.  It may be either-or for one  individual or for a single organization.  But not for a whole movement.The Left has advanced on many different fronts using different degrees of stridency and comfort.  But they make most of their advances in the name of “fairness,” appealing to the legendary soccer moms.They won an important anti-gun ballot measure in my state a while back by campaigning for “common-sense safety regulations.”  They did not advocate taking everyone’s guns (as they want to do) and then saying, “oh.that’s what we asked for, but now we can compromise.”  If anything, they masked their immoderate intent.  (It helped that they had a boatload of out-of-state progbucks.)On the other side, but with a similar moral, the pro-2A people have gained more than ten states that allow concealed carry without a permit.  This used to be called “Vermont carry,” after the only state that allowed it.This important change did not happen by pro-gun groups loudly advocating a belt-fed weapon in every home and then falling back to a compromise position.  They accomplished this with money, hard work, and — especially —  a reasonable position that appealed to a lot of people.As for Connerly’s efforts … having a law is not enough.  It takes people and money to mount court cases against violations to it … and to refine it as opponents find and exploit loopholes.

        the alt right, alt lite, NAZI LARPers, cuckservative issue is, and I mean this sincerely, legitimately interesting to me…
my only problem is that I’m not sure how much it helps the movement, and the problem seems ultimately intractable and not open to intentional intervention anyway.  I wonder if we’re not just better leaving the whole thing to the so called “animal spirits” as it were and move on to other things.

        Thanks for bringing up these points. I had assumed that “provocateur” meant someone working for the other side (which would make Anglin a leftist), but that is actually an “agent provocateur”. An ordinary provocateur is simply one who provokes.My take on folks like Anglin are similar to yours. I figure the way you find a website that supports free speech, is to find one with Nazis on it – even if I think most Nazis are either fools or actual “agents provocateurs”. If such are not there, the site is one for which free speech is not a priority. In other words, just another propaganda outlet.

        Desensitization works both ways.Rhetorically, this whole nazi fad has outlived it’s usefulness. I learned something by disagreeing with the Storm fags on Gab. They tried some of their usual taunts on me and they fell flat. It is all boring and overused.Cuck has lost it’s effectiveness. Calling those who disagree with them the “Sekrit Joo” is so outdone it is laughable. Their “gonna put you in the EZ bake oven” meme is boring.Just like the liberals, who called people racist till it no longer meant anything, their rhetoric is dull and retarded and no longer effective.The Storm fags are like the migrant invasion of Europe on Gab.They squat in the streets amongst their own feces and hurl unintelligible gibberish at you as you pass by.They will take over and spread their dirt culture and run everyone else off.I get the ironic nazi thing, but a lot of these Anglinists are true believers. How retarded is that?

            There’s a reason why I get no grief from the Stormies, despite my opinions on the JQ. There’s a reason that the big foot guys in the alt-right read me, despite my positions on many things. The reason is I focus on the enemy and I’m willing to accept that people on my side may disagree with me on things.
I’ll also note that when I offer criticism, I’m usually right and when I’m wrong I admit it.

            When I was a young guy I thought they were a lot of fun! Apparently LSD showed signs of being useful for treating alcoholism, such that Bill Wilson, founder of AA, endorsed it.My observation is that they aren’t particularly dangerous – I’ve never known of anyone experiencing any permanent harm from psychedelics, unless they had some other pre-existing condition. But I’m not sure they offer any advantage when being used recreationally, either. Mostly they seem to be something people try a few times and then get bored with.I don’t regret my experiences with them. On the other hand, I don’t have much interest in repeating them, either.

            AWM;LSD etc. was a thing among my contemporaries in the mid ’60s.  Most reacted as Bruno did, some had bad trips and never tried it again, but a (relatively small) number were completely ruined by the experience, ended up in psych hospitals, spent the rest of their lives on psych meds, eventual suicide, etc. *Two died* as a direct result from LSD induced accidents.Now, you may say that the bad stuff was going to happen anyway because it’s well known that young adulthood is when schizophrenic breaks and other forms of mental illness show up, etc.  But I seem to recall that there was (yet another) criminally stupid CIA scandal where they gave LSD to unknowing subjects and were forced to stop because a few of them jumped out of windows or were institutionalized.*Bottom Line: it can be dangerous.  My advice: Best not to screw with it.Why_? It is well known that there is a genetic link to addictive behavior.  So my theory, FWIW, is that some people’s brains are genetically pre-wired for bad trips but won’t know it until they try it, and there is no going back for a subset of those.  So the proposition for first use is: Upside = temporary euphoria; Not-so-small downside = bad trip, your weekend is ruined; Really bad downside = bad trip, your life is ruined.And you have no idea ahead of time which bucket you fall into.  Sorta like seeing if you can beat the train at the grade crossing: If you win your reward is bragging rights that (ought to) look dumb in retrospect and if you lose, you lose everything.* CIA had some cockamamie justification about needing to see how it would work so they could give it to commie leaders or something.  Poisoning a foreign leader *used* to be considered an act of war.

            The counter to that is the people in charge are going to say all the same things about us with or without Anglin. Therefore, his antics, if done right, become a way to mock moral framework underlying those claims. If you are worried about “looking bad” in the eyes of the Progs, you may as well join them, as that’s what’s going to happen eventually.
They are not wrong in that.

                    For sure.  Normal people lose respect for their rulers when their rulers are seen going nuts over a clown making sport of them. That’s the point of these provocateurs. They want to get the people in charge to come at them. It’s Mayweather fighting the MMA guy. The best he could do was not lose. Winning meant nothing. McGregor managed to raise his profile simply by getting in the ring.

        There’s so much that is wrong in this post.Where to begin.One of the main reasons why the Right has been on a losing streak for the last century is precisely because of its inability to define itself. This is a far deeper problem than many realise. Having the Right “Feelz” should not be conflated with being Right wing.Anglin’s free speech rights are irrelevant here. The fact that Anglin is given a sympathetic forum by anyone on the Right shows you just how pozzed the Right is. National Socialism was precisely that, a National Leftism. How someone encapsulating the ideas of Left can somehow be a spokesman for the Right is simply beyond me. The genius of National socialism, or Fascism for that matter, was in being able to dress up a Left Wing ideology in Right Wing drab. The cognitive misers fall for it all the time.The fact is, that many on the Right are are Right wing by virtue of disposition, attracted to it on the basis of the “Feelz” rather than the underlying rational basis of the ideology. Hence the allure of brown and red. Just as there is a lot of sympathy for Lenin on the Left, the reality of the situation is that there is far too much sympathy for the Fuhrer on the Right, particularly on the American Right.Anglin’s role is to play on those sympathies in order to draw off the intellectually weaker members and split the Right. He’s no useful idiot. Furthermore, he doesn’t destroy the other side’s moral authority but reinforces it.  This is about mass-man politics not logical rational discourse. The average man’s moral calculus see’s no problems with the silencing of men like Anglin because they can rightly recognise the toxicity of his ideology. It just ain’t gonna happen.I, personally, don’t give a shit about the Left, it’s the normies that matter. Purging stormfags like Anglin reinforces the legitimacy of the Dissident Right among the Normies and undercuts the Left’s narrative. It’s as simple as that.

            Buckley and National Review purged the badthinkers from the right and they kept losing despite their purity.
The right that has had their butts kicked for decade after decade have spent enormous effort disavowing and condemning those evil racists and Nazis.
It hasn’t worked…ever.
You want to replicate the same failed strategy and expect that it will somehow magically work this time.
No election has made any difference because the right accepts the lefts definitions and roll over anytime they point and shriek Nazi.

                The Right has been losing well before Buckley did his purges. Buckely’s problem is that he didn’t purge more ruthlessly. He  was right to purge the Stormfags but he was wrong in not purging the Neocons.

                Wrong. The winning strategies are to either ignore the prog chirping or to put a thumb in their eyes. Never apologize. Scott Adams details this understanding, which is the Trump strategy. And if you can’t deal with the worm don’t drink the Mezcal. Wine for you.

                    He missed that “nazis are left-wing,” is a point that has no political cache. Liberals reject it out of hand, libertarians accept it apriori, and nationalists don’t fall cleanly on one side or the other. It’s also tangential to the issue of criticizing larpnazi optics since, even if one could demonstrate that nazis are “right-wing,” they would still be fools to fly the swastika at a public event.

            The quality of his work has definitely fallen off. Lately he is exhibiting all the traits of the ‘gamma males’ that he hates so much. Awhile back he admonished everyone not to ‘punch tight’ on fascists on the grounds that they could be used as useful fools against the left. Now he’s beating up on cellar dwelling fascists and pasty faced poseurs and strutting around as if he’s some kind of crusading tough guy… like the flits at Antifa. He’s accused dozens of people of pedophilia on the internet and now he’s waging lawfare against Gab because someone called him a pedo.That boy better get a grip or he and his fan boys are going to lose any credibility they have left…
