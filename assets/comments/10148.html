        One recommendation is to pair Shakespeare’s history plays with readings in English history of the same era.  Had the privilege of taking my British history sequences under the late Lacey Baldwin Smith and this was a technique that he used very effectively.

            This is an excellent point. I alluded to it with the mention of Piers Plowman. It’s not only a good way to appreciate literature, but it helps you appreciate history.

        If you pick up schoolbook from the 1870’s like a Appleton’sr or a McGuffey Reader you’ll see a goodly portion is devoted to the works of welll known English and American poets and writers. The prose is just beautiful.It was clear that poetry was considered essential for a student’s education and making him fit for society.The thing that amazed me going through Appleton’s and McGuffey’s was that the stories, poetry would be today considered appropriate for a college level English course. The material is certainly not simplified.Both can be picked up for a reasonable price at Amazon. And any parent ought to at least pick up a McGuffey and compare it to what their children are learning. And  either makes  for a nice introduction to English literature.

        The Germans gave us some dumb ideas in the 20th century but they gave us most of the good ones before  that (Kant, Goethe, and Nietzsche were more essential to Western man’s intellectual formation, I think, than anything going back to Greek antiquity). Also, even though the victors control the big publishing houses, it’s important to point out that, if you know where to look, you’ll see a conservative movement that was a robust and worthy reaction to Critical Theory’s stupidity around the same time (especially Ernst Junger and Carl Schmitt).I like older English literature, but it goes flaccid in the 20th century (Graham Greene, Kingsley Amis, Anthony Burgess, etc); there’s something so defeatist and degenerate about the postwar English (can’t say I entirely blame them). France had Hugo, who was good; Zola is a turgid but useful historical fiction writer. A lot of amoral talented sleazebag homos came from France, like Gide and Genet. The best writers seemed to come from Russia; Dostoevsky has no equal anywhere; Ivan Bunin won the Nobel Prize a long time ago, and is mostly forgotten, but he’s the best short story writer ever, I believe.Taste obviously plays a larger part. I had to stop reading Bruce Charlton a while back because he wouldn’t shut up about Lord of the Rings and C.S. Lewis. I like my fantasy tougher (Robert E. Howard’s skull-crackers like Conan and Solomon Kane).

        I’m going to admit to hating poetry and that most of what I know about all of the above is from reading about it rather than reading it.I agree with watching the Shakespeare videos. Watching a performance provides insight to the meaning of some of the dialog that might have to be explained in a footnote that, depending on the edition you get, might not be there.Bunyan up until when I was young, was the second most published book in the world after the Bible itself.An abridged version of Plowman is fine for getting the gist of how many regular folk saw the state of things in that age. If you come across a Medieval reader of some sort one will be in there.

            I have some hostility to poetry as well. Hatred of poetry is an American thing. Every Brit I’ve known has had a fondness for it. Same with the Irish. I think the North American fondness for practicality is the issue. Poetry is frivolous.
I agree with Shakespeare’s plays. It is best to see them. I’m not a fan of the theater, but see a decent performance of Shakespeare is fun and it is easier to follow along. These plays were written to be performed in front of real people.

                My 10 cents is to recommend something published by the NYT of all things, but back in 1936, “The Best Loved Poems of the American People” which you can pick up for a couple bucks.   It’s an anthology of the most requested poems as compiled by the NYT back when people would write to the editor of a paper to ask for literary information.  Thus, it is not anthology of what the critics say is the best, but what the people actually liked.Casabianca, I am a stranger in the land/where my forefathers trod, Finnegans wake and the cremation of Sam McGee, Yukon Jake, hell in Texas, Carmen possum, overworked elocutionist, the ride of Paul revere, the touch of the masters hand, the years at the spring, Flanders fields, O Captain, would I shrivel, derelict (15 men on a dead man’s chest, yohoho and a bottle of rum), Invictus.

                i don’t like poetry for the same reason i don’t like opera — they aren’t one thing or the other.  poetry is an attempt to make a kind of musical text.  really more of a kind of word game, than serious writing.  just the kind of thing homos would promote.

                    That’s very perceptive. I’ve read some poetry and seen some opera because I felt like I was supposed to get something it of it but I hate both. A complete waste of time. How anyone can be amused at all by this stuff defeats me. Maybe I’m just a peasant but I don’t care for it.

                Yeah, better to see the plays than read them, but seeing them is better after you have read them. His puns and repartee come at you so fast, it’s better to be prepared somewhat.
Oh – and the modernization of his plays. Don’t.
Sorry. Won’t inflict my ignorance upon you any further.

        The Canterbury Tales are hardly accessible if read in the original language but this retelling is a wonderful read:The Canterbury Tales: A Retelling by Peter Ackroyd ISBN-10: 0670021229

            Correct. For most readers, it is effectively in a foreign language.  Still, this can be an advantage if someone is reasonably intelligent and has never gone far in their studies of any other language.  Many editions in the original language that I’ve seen (cf. Norton Anthology)  have glossaries/footnotes etc. which help a dedicated reader and allow one to have the joy of the experience of the original.

            Try reading it aloud phonetically sometime. Some of it will still be impenetrable, but you’ll be surprised how much of it suddenly clicks.

                I agree with this, but I it still require a higher level of effort. If your goals is to just become familiar with the subject, then maybe the modern translations are best.

                    i find writing from Fielding’s era tough sledding, so I can’t imagine how tough reading Chaucer would be!   when you really want to wear the hair shirt, do you guys (who do read the source Chauce) read it in a period script?  😛

                        oh, and I would strongly strongly recommend visiting Canterbury.   it is like going back in time, and that is without the aid of hallucinogenics.  the original medieval town and walls are all intact.

                In college I took an Old English course.  It turned out to be excellent.  We went right into the written material, with a spelling guide and a modest dictionary written by the instructor.  Compared to my experience with other languages, it is amazing how quickly one can learn to read Old English, and even pick up subtleties and nuances in the language.

                Exactly, and it’s why I would rather watch an accurately done movie of a Shakespeare play, preferably with subtitles, than read it. My ear is better than my eye. Plus I am a German speaker which seems to help a lot especially with the older ones, such as the Canterbury Tales.

        To me, poetry is an anachronism. Like opera. It was great at one time, but it requires a love of language that few people possess today. Plus, the deconstructionism of language a la Orwell, makes poetry a luxury that few people indulge in. And since there are no true great poets today, it seems like a  bygone relic.

        “The important themes from the important plays are so baked into the culture that there’s no point in reading them in the original.”Couldn’t disagree more. Too much lost to “comfortable”, or incompetent transposition/ translation.Frankly, I can’t see today’s  “liberal arts” as anything but an exercise in“Gentleman’s C ” credentials without a firm foundation in Aesop’s Fables.Of COURSE i can’t read them in the  original. It’s all Greek to me!

        Seems like the revisionists from Marx to the Frankfurt school and the agenda of revised history in whole has turned the classical critical theory on its head. They managed to infect even that classical basis of examining the truth.So that pretty much leaves the agrarian related sciences and philosophies as the only bulwark against all revisionism, because the agrarian is so closely related to nature and the personal experience and enlightenment derived from that relationship, unless you never raised a garden, or involved in provincial animal husbandry, a trade in contact with nature, or just live in the rural enclaves, that Frankfurt revised critical theory catches you out and your as ignorant of the classical theory as a new born babe.I always felt somehow Tolken’s works made that agrarian/nature connection with the natural world as the basis of good verses evil an integral component of his stories.I think too, works like Gary North’s Political Polytheism, how the marxists/Fabians removed God and the Scriptures from government as a way to rid America at least of it’s scruples and moral compass, and by doing so seeding everything with revisionism most and certainly the weaker willed, eliminated the most symbolic references to traditions and principles of Christian Western culture long held and dearly won.In a way, it is not enough to understand revisionism, who and what created it, but to understand the roots of why so many worked at it, how could so many partake in such an evil deliberate crime? What thing in common drove these men to commit such a sin on western humanity. What possessed and drove them?Obviously these men where pretty smart to begin with to create the revisionism to create the revisionism so to speak. Where they possessed with some sadistic mania, was it like a drug to them, how did so many become drawn together at such a juncture in time?certainly nothing good has come of any of it but the power elites and the long train of marxist dictators. It certainly led to the liquidation of hundreds of millions of people.What are the roots of such an evil?What are the clues? I’d like to understand.It seems ut is the key to so much today.

        Zman.  You continue to rock &amp; roll man!  Great stuff.  And many thanks.One thought that occurred to me as I was thinking about your “Essential Knowledge” Series.  It seems to me that “essential” to reversing the damage from the Academia Leftist to the minds of our young folks, is to capture both the essence of freedom and it’s development, and the evil that is in direct opposition to it, what we fight every day.A compendium of those American jewels like the Founding documents, to De Tocqueville, and many others on both politics, economics and history.  Maybe there is already some overlap with what you have already provided, I just haven’t gone back to check.  On the left, there is the Marx, Gramsci, Alinsky tripe, along with Cloward-Piven, the Communist Manifesto, the USCPA Goals on Record from the 1960’s,  and more.And of course, those writings and resources that are fictitious but notable in and of themselves.  Things like Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged”, C.S. Lewis, and others that depict the unchanging essence of human nature and the blessings of God our Creator.I know your audience and regular commenters are familiar with much of this already but as I continue to think about the growth of your site and the new readership, exposing others to these things which is sorely lacking in the mainstream, would, in my estimation, be a great service to the public.

        I guess, by your (and I’m sure most people’s) estimation that I am doomed to remain ignorant. I can’t read more than half the material you deem “essential”. Mainly because I do not find it to be essential, or worth the time. I read other material as my interest wanders. For instance, all of Bill’s plays, none of his sonnets. I have read a lot of scientific literature on things related to my career, and a lot that related to my career in only the vaguest way.If that makes me ignorant by someone else’s standards, so be it. Neither upsets me or intimidates me.
