        I have a case study to add to this discussion. In our town there is a local, family-owned supermarked. 3rd generation owner-operators, nice couple that is, wait for it… white.With a large hispanic population within walking distance, every Sunday was literally ‘hispanic day’ with the store crowded with the day laborers that are found crowding the roadsides during the week, buying their groceries and their Corona®.The nice white owners bend over backwards for this part of their clientele. Bring in all these foods and brands that cater to the hispanic customers. Hire Spanish speakers to help with the non English speakers or those that can barely communicate beyond pointing a finger at their choice of cigarette brand.An hispanic operated (we do not know the ownership information) grocery store just opened up within walking distance of said clientele. Spanish language signage, name. The result: NOT ONE HISPANIC FACE to be found at the white-owned store.From a crowd to an obvious soft boycott. No matter what efforts were made by the owners. What could be behind this shopping preference?

            I also have experience with Indians in Atlanta. For many years I went to an Indian restaurant and got to know the owners. They were Indian from Africa. I asked the younger member how he identified himself and he responded Hindu.I asked the older ones the same question and their response was place of birth, South Africa. You don’t think of yourselves as American? I asked. Answer from all: No. But they did Indian.Another example was my neighborhood. Indians and others moved in and refused to pay their share of upkeep of common areas. Whites paid but none of the other groups did. I moved out.

            I have a Paki greengrocer practically on my doorstep – weird and low-quality greens, but excellent spices and cheap pulses, and I shop there at least twice a week.So I notice the owner doesn’t speak to me. Not too uncommon in Denmark, where “customer service” is something you get in massage parlors, but I think, “Hey, I’ve been coming here for years, you fucker, and you’re not even looking at me”, so I very deliberately and pointedly start to say “good morning” and “thank you” and “see you later”, and after a few months he starts answering back, even smile at times.Except when there are other Pakis in the shop. Then I’m back to being another filthy infidel, he looks to a point over my right shoulder when he hands me my groceries.

                Are you saying (as I read) that you had to “train” your grocer to be a human being?  Sigh.

                    Yes, (although on reflection, it didn’t take “months” as I wrote, more like a week.)
The incidence has stuck with me for some time now because of what I wrote below, namely that whites don’t fight because they can’t see how any adversary could threaten them.
His petty, impotent hate amuses me.

        I live Northern Virginia, which has a huge Indian population. They act exactly like Jews. Actually, they act exactly like Jews used to act a couple of generations ago. (The current Jewish population has been either 1) diluted from out marriage or 2) doesn’t quite have the fire in their belly – though they retain their natural middle-men abilities.)Pound for pound, Indians don’t seem to be as talented as Jews, but there’s a lot more Indians and they’re just as tribal so they’re able to compete very well against Jews. (Again, they seem to bit hungrier than the current generation of Jews.)I honestly don’t think Jews know what’s about to hit them. Much like Whites evolved to be trusting, Jews have evolved to take advantage of Whites. Jews aren’t used to competing against other reasonably bright, tribal groups (Indians) or groups that are extremely racially aware (Han Chinese who live in China).East Asians in America may not be particularly ethnocentric, but they are very racially aware, and they definitely recognize Jews as a special group. What’s more, they don’t a give a crap about the Jewish “Holocaust” or that they got ran out of some town in Eastern Europe 300 years ago.Jews will compete directly with Indians. Regarding East Asians in U.S., they aren’t as tribal but no way will Jews be able to pull off “my fellow East Asians” with this crowd, and that’s half of Jews’ playbook.

            “Ihonestly don’t think Jews know what’s about to hit them.”For all the Jews’ intelligence, they sure are self-destructive. They’ve had it really good in America and then they have to mess with the immigration policy, and launch anti-white propaganda. Now that everything’s becoming all about race, they’re going to miss the days when it was simply about idealogy.

                What they’re going to miss is being the only capable group who thought and acted tribally. They had the field to themselves. Now they don’t.
It was only Whites who thought ideology mattered. Jews always knew that tribe comes first. Being able to focus on ideology is a luxury afforded by tribes that have secured their lands against other tribes.

                But for the New Left, ideology has always been about race. Or, more specifically, anti-white racism.

            Agreed 100 percent. One of the drivers behind the Jewish panic over Trump, who, let’s face it, more or less is one of them in outlook, was it represented Jews no longer were in absolute control. Hollywood and the entertainment industry are being snatched from them, their propaganda outlets are circling the drain, and elected agents such as Engels are being tossed out of office. Outside of dwindling legacy Jews, even wealth is reverting back to the Puritan overlords. Outmarriage is responsible to a degree, but the loss of confidence and solidarity has been remarkable to watch. It mirrors what happened to usAs a related aside, Harris was a terrible selection and her marriage to a Jew probably will be blamed, in part, if Biden loses.

            The Indians tend to cluster in certain areas.  Tons of them here in the DFW area, many of whom fled from NJ because it was already overflowing with their countrymen.  They all plan to attend Ivy League schools and rule the world.The East Asians, at least here in DFW, are equally tribal.  Their kids only play with other East Asians.  They all go to cram school together.  There are half a dozen prominently labeled “Chinese” churches here, where older White congregations have vanished.Both groups have a constant influx of new members, keeping that tribalism at a high pitch.  The Indians start running for the school board and local offices as soon as they have their magic papers, while the East Asians wait a bit, but the end result is still the same – total White dispossession physically and legally.

                Spot on with the politics. Indians get involved in politics quickly and deeply. They run for everything. They set up Indian political groups, cultural groups, etc. They know how the game is played.
The Jews still do that as well, but they’re not as aggressive. (Scary, right.)

                I have much experience with the Indian population in DFW, particularly in Collin county. They’re thieving, cheap, swindling rat bastards. I did a lot of house calls in my line of work then, and they absolutely insist that you take off your shoes at the door lest you scratch the laminate flooring in their shitty Frisco mcmansion with all that rubber crown molding.That said, a family once insisted that I eat dinner with them after completing some work on their home. The chicken curry they had cooked up was delicious, but as I was eating I began to notice that the entire brood—about ten of them—were USING THEIR HANDS TO EAT. I completed the meal, thanked the husband and left praying that I wouldn’t have to return.

                    Yeah, that eating with their hands bit will turn your stomach alright. Fortunately, almost none of them do that in Indian restaurants, and those who do are typically elderly.

        I stopped watching The Simpsons after they axed Apu. Oh, and another thing that makes Indians incredibly dangerous: they’re driven by resentment like Jews, only probably much, much worse. My brother works in tech and talks about how they gripe (like black women in corporations) that they make tons of money and still can’t find a woman. They want to be debonair and suave, not just rich, but that mirror is not going to show them Daniel Craig. Power alone is one thing. Mixed with resentments it becomes highly combustible.

                I hung in there like a sportsball fan waving the pennant during a run of bad luck, but the unpersoning of Apu gave me an excuse to cut bait once and for all. You can track the death of historical America by watching episodes of the The Simpsons, like watching a flower grow in time-elapsed photography. Watch “Homer the Heretic” again and then compare it to anything past season 18 or so.

Excellent point. So true and so brilliant.
Along these same lines, syndicators are starting to erase some images and mute words now found offensive on old television shows. And “old” in this case can be as recent as the late Nineties.

                Well, I guess the silver lining is that their traditions will do what all traditions do when they come to America, which is die. I hate to sound unpatriotic (I still have some normie residue in my blood), but I think Thrasymachus the blogger had it right when he said America is the Seinfeld of countries, a country about nothing. The Russians and Chinese have millennia of meaning in their lands; we have a chain of successions by people who fled their homes to make more money (not a bad idea, but you can’t build a metaphysics on something material). And we have “freedom” (which today is translated as the removal of obligations and duties). The other day I ran into a Pakistani woman who ran a laundromat in my suburb, whose son has gone in a matter of a couple years in-country from being a scowling little Muslim to a fat and effeminate mama’s boy. If that boy had any dignity, he’d be plotting to blow up infidels like myself, but now he just wants to eat Cheetos and get good at Halo.

            Any comment by an Indian at any conservative/moderately race realist site (where they love to lurk and comment, God only knows why) will be rife with resentment towards the British.  They attribute all their native country’s ills to colonialism, particularly including caste and social rank by skin color.  The men fancy themselves eligible based on income, and the half dozen benighted White women I’ve met who’ve mated with them have children darker than many mulattoes.

                “They attribute all their native country’s ills to colonialism”… That reminds me. I had a professor in college from whom I took a couple of classes. He was old school in his thinking and this was the early 90s. He did a whole lecture on colonialism and its aftermath and made a point of comparing the relative success of former colonial holdings of the British as compared to other colonial powers. Whether it was African, Caribbean, Asian or Pacific… all had a remarkably brighter existence than neighboring former colonies of other European powers.I imagine (he was relatively young) that if he is still teaching today they are building gallows for him as we speak.Additionally and OT, he was a trained archeologist and expert in American Indian history and his sideline gig was arbitration between tribes and construction companies when Indian remains were found. Smooth things over so to speak (unruffled feathers and help set a reasonable figure to bribe the Indians into allowing “respectful reinterments”).He loved American Indig cultures but was always very realistic about them. Made sure to portray them as humans, warts and all. Dedicated a lecture to their pre-1492 slave practices and penchant for torture. I remember him giving a moment by moment breakdown of the Battle of Little Big Horn. A particularly uppity little blond gal (I guarantee she is a box wine auntie nowadays) who was perpetually offended by his lectures on Am. Indians sniffed and blurted out, “Well if they killed all of Custer’s men how do you know if that’s what happened!? (smug look around for approval). He paused the lecture and said, “Well, a lot of Indians survived it and they were more than happy to talk about it.”He was great. Hope they didn’t burn him at the stake if he kept teaching.

                The Irish are almost equally obsessive about bashing the British for all their past and present woes. But at least the Irish have some historical reasons for their blame game. Indians, though, got a helping hand from the Brits and are much better off because of colonialism.
In a way you have to admire dot Indians: they support theirownco-ethnics, even if the old caste system lingers. The Irish can’t seem to get enough of importing Africans and other undesirables to replace themselves.

                I think they have mistresses even when they have wives. Also a lot of cultures that frown on infidelity or promiscuity have all these weird work-arounds/hedges that allow them to be hypocrites. There are gypsies, for instance, who maintain their virginity until marriage…by only having anal intercourse before marriage. And I know a girl who works at a strip club who says the Indian guys are the grimiest, and always breaking rules about touching/photography; I’d hazard those guys are married.

                Fom what little I know about India, and I can guarantee you it is very little 😁 due to the cultural preference for males, and the widespread availability of legal abortion, there is a huge deficit of females. Therefore ironically the very few females that are available can pick and choose.

                I suspect the highest caste of Indians were long ago the forerunners of both our peoples. The Indo Europeans got knocked off the rails by centuries of invasion and I’d dare say finished off by the Moguls.Like the old  line  Nordic Greek  stock are still out there but not in dense numbers.I suspect what happened is they did very well,exp[ended all over the place  got weak, got invaded and were pushed back a victim of their own success.There is also  the fact that White people quite often mate with other groups unless society drops the hammer on it.The number of White Americans  with Asian, Amerind , Hispanic  or other forebears is considerable. This does not mean mixed race in the traditional sense. These people are White they just aren’t a specific stock like you might find in Europe.

            I stopped watching the Simpsons regularly in 90 or so — that’s when we stopped watching broadcast or cable TV. I picked up the occasional episode in a hotel room before hotel broadband became ubiquitous in the mid 2000s or so. I probably haven’t seen an episode since then.

        The corollary of this rule is that politics will no longer be about meaningful, substantive political issues, but rather about issues of identity. Conservatives immediately push back on this corollary in a reactive manner, because in Conservative World all humans are fundamentally concerned about the same things. I have been using the example of the Laffer curve to illustrate my point to legacy conservatives and it works tremendously.For those too young to recall, the Laffer curve was developed by economist Arthur Laffer as an attempt to apply behavioral economics to rationalize the Reagan tax cuts and ultimately Supply Side Economics. Ostensibly sketched on a napkin at a dinner discussion, Laffer observed as an axiom that the government would collect $0 in taxes at an income tax rate of zero, because it is collecting no taxes. Similarly, the government would collect $0 in taxes at an income tax rate of 100%, because nobody would bother to work if the government is taking all their earnings.Therefore, there must be a curve between these two zero end points that would characterize government tax collections as a function of income tax rates. Laffer posited that the curve was a parabolic function that had a maximum, then posited that income tax rates were too high and that government income could be increased by reducing tax rates, because people would work more. From this came the conservative position that reducing tax rates always increases tax receipts, a position that every conservative will recognize.It turned out that Laffer was largely correct in the late ’70s and early ’80s, when he was writing, because the pre-Reagan tax rates were truly punitive, but that’s not terribly critical for my purposes. What is important is that conservatives and liberals fought valiant intellectual battles over the Laffer curve. It was the subject of thousand of research studies in economics departments across the world. Tens of thousands of articles containing millions of words of debate were written about the finer points of an economic theory which is largely axiomatic in nature. The Laffer curve was a significant part of the economic debate of every Presidential election in the ’80s and ’90s, and even worked its way into global politics.That ended in 2008. Candidate Obama had no position on the Laffer curve because he did not need one. Obama’s candidacy was about identity, not ideology or policy. Obama advocated tax increases on the wealthy not because he believed such increases would increase government tax receipts per a Laffer curve analysis, but because those increased taxes would be redistributed from a population of mostly white people to a population of mostly black and brown people. Full stop. No further analysis required.Flash forward to 2020 and there are no substantive issues in the Democratic party platform. It is simply a laundry list of identity-based diversity, inclusion, and equity demands. It reads like it was developed in an undergraduate class in political science at Brown University, because it probably was.If they take place, the debates in 2020 are going to be an embarrassment to the Western political tradition, precisely because the Democrats are no longer a party that is of the Western political tradition. There will be no discussion of tax rates, economic policy, military policy, or the appropriate role of institutions in our society. Neither Biden nor Harris have anything meaningful to say about these topics. The only issues that matter are diversity, inclusion, and equity.This conversation registers strongly with conservatives. Initially, conservatives inherently mourn the loss of intellectual debate in politics. More importantly, it provides a construct to link the complete annihilation of the Laffer curve’s role in politics in the context of changing demographics. Once they grasp that the mighty Laffer Curve is no longer relevant to political debate in a diverse polity, it’s a short and straight line to understanding that absolutely none of the values or ideas they hold fast as a conservative are relevant in 2020. At that point it’s a lot easier for them to get in the boat and start rowing across the river. Welcome to the Demographic Age.

            Thanks for this well-written comment. Back in the day, the Laffer Curve was a key that unlocked so much Conservative public policy. It was wielded to cut through Leftists’ cant, forcing them to agree *on their own terms* to the propriety of low tax burdens. It gave “scientific” vindication to Conservative impulses, and encouraged Rightist thinkers to explore other ways Conservatism supported a broader “public good.” There was a price to be paid–namely, the admission that maximizing tax receipts was a positive good–but that wasn’t consequential at the time. That time is long over now, of course.

        Call me a yesterday man, but Kamala can call herself whatever she wants.  It doesn’t change the fact that we’re not talking about horses or hounds.  The One Drop rule applies to her, just as it did to Obama.  They’re both niggers; and no amount of tech oligarch money is going to elevate them to anything other than jumped up fools.  Nothing in history even faintly suggests that giving such no-account people power is anything but deeply stupid.

                    That’s good. We need more Trad Catholics having lots of kids and raising them in our (yt) ways.

        Identity politics leads to identity discrimination. Example: a friend said she’d sit down in an Indian or Thai restaurant in Seattle; the Indians got served but whites waited….and waited, got the message and then left.

Make Seattle Calcutta, make America Indian again. At least Trump fired Preet Bwahaha in NY. The worst kind of person invited to a former great country.

And precisely what does that have to do with identity politics?
Auster’s Laws of Majority-Minority Relations in Liberal Society.
“The worse any designated minority or alien group behaves in a liberal society, the bigger become the lies of Political Correctness in covering up for that group.”
If the east indians what to rampage around  screaming about victimhood, do you really think it’s going to matter who the hell colonized their freaking country?

                One of the biggest, growing communities on youtube are scambaitters that screw with phjeet tech support scammers. Kitboga by himself has over one million subs. While the content creators themselves don’t overtly say “racist” things, the comments on their videos are deeply based and red-pilled. Just hundreds of normie comments making fun of the frankly ridiculous indian behavior and some pretty insightful comments about the nature of indians- how materialistic, grasping, clueless on real tech skills, sociopathic they tend to be. The recorded videos make it clear, probably unintentionally, what a group of trash they really are. Normies also notice a 13/50 thing with scammers- indians are like 10 percent of the world population but do 90 percent of the english speaking scams. Worse for them yet, they can make no even plausible claim of some eternal victim-hood.

                    In my experience Indians are also 100% of tech recruiters now.  I used to pay some attention to them before I gave up on the whole tech racket.  The scam they work seems to be contacting anyone with a “white” sounding name and offering to represent you for some tech position at a ridiculously high salary.  This allows the company to claim they just couldn’t find an American for the role and they can now hire the recruiter’s cousin Pravin at $8.00/hr.Overall they do seem to epitomize soulless greed and materialism better than even Jews, who often at least maintain a veneer of intellectualism.  It’s interesting also that they seem to have positioned themselves part-way between Jews and Gypsies in the kinds of things they get into.  Some of them seem to like playing around with seedy but sort-of legal financial and corporate shell games (the Silicon Valley crew) while others are focused on more directly criminal but still “white collar” scamming like the phony tech support thing.  Then again, the Rom (gypsies) do seem to originate from the subcontinent.  Part of me feels a bit of Schadenfreude though towards the Jews who conspired to bring these people here and are now getting muscled out of their traditional rackets by the Indians.

                        Sir, that is a strawman. Your sample includes the worst kind of Indian immigrants (those working for cheap IT consulting companies). My father came to the US as a college professor, and we’ve assimilated well. Most Indians I know coming in through the PhD route are great. Additionally, Indians aren’t a monolith as you perceive them to be; Indians from one region often dislike Indians from other regions.

            Hm. I’ve been to a slew of Indian restaurants all over the western hemisphere and never received anything less than excellent service. Now Messkin restaurants have sometimes been a different story.

                No need for Indians to have Indian food.  Do what the Japanese do – send individuals to learn to cook other cuisines.  Don’t import aliens for muh ethnic restaurants.

                        Here in Portland we take our Leftism so seriously that the the only thing more racist than a white person eating Indian food is a white person refusing to eat Indian food.
It shouldn’t be long before you can troll a Portland lefty into believing that, because racism is so deeply ingrained in white culture, that for a white man to adopt “anti-racist” politics is, in fact, racist as hell.  Logically the only way for me to be truly anti-racist… is to join the Klan.

            This kind of politics often  ends up in genocide either the passive kind, a group is driven out peacefully or by more ugly means.Regardless Left or Right anyone amusing that there is any political solution for any problem is whistling past the graveyard.Our leaders can’t even maintain our cities and they can go in a few months from pretty good i.e. NYC under Rudy Giuliani to  utter collapse fueled by bad decisions and technology.Its the Zoom revolution speeding up the impsion from decades or centuries to years or hell months.This tells me a collapse slow or even rapid or  civil war will take us out.Its understandable, a nation founded by grifters and  economic refugees and held together by Yankee guns and more recently fear of the USSR is not one that has any shared history or purpose. Its a fake country and as such does not need to exist.Ultimately its the job of the DR to build anew and as such if we are strong enough to do it, we decide who stays and who goes. Vae Victus

            This is exactly why I think the post-Trump GOP is done, either this time or, if he is re-elected, in 2024. A significant slice of Republicans have soured on Conservatism, Inc., and will not show up to vote for a Haley or Rubio in large enough numbers to prevent a left-wing sweep in 2024. The GOP will be a zombie unless it becomes a nationalist populist party, which it most assuredly will not.

                    Trump killed Conservative Inc. in 2016, the way he kills everything: by forcing it to reveal its true self. In retrospect the GOP was already moribund at that time, which is why Trump got any traction at all. His victory in the primaries shows that people were already sick of the party, and looking for an alternative.The other party is dead too, of course. Look at its stable of leaders, the “platform” it supposedly promotes. It represents the opposite of politics.Both parties are just brand names now, and few even remember the product each touted; most just buy the brand because it’s familiar, or because it’s associated with a certain class or celebrity. The parties are relics of America’s dead past; the coalitions and interests that made them are no longer our realities. New coalitions and interests are emerging now, but are still in flux. When they become more coherent, we’ll see political parties emerge to reflect that. But I’m afraid that’s a generational undertaking.

                Meh,  the republicans were and to large degree remain Whigs.  The party was hi-jacked in the nineties by neo-cons.  It’s worth remembering that they became part of Reagan’s coalition in the 80s but were definitely junior partners and often criticized Reagan for being to soft.  Also worth remembering that Reagan’s SoS is reputed to have Sade &lt;I&gt;fuck the Jews, they never vote for us anyway&lt;/i&gt; while in office.  The new-cons that became dominant in the 00s under Bush were fading with the failure of Iraq anyway and their petulant nevertrumpism is rendering them completely irrelevant.So, the Republicans could become an explicitly nationalist party again (of the civic variety not in the white nationalism sense) relatively quickly.  Especially as the Covid hysteria is making a lot of people rethink globalism.

                    While I don’t think there is a political solution at this point, politics still can be used as one of many tools to achieve what we want as long as it is used in combination with other more viable arrows in the quiver. So a major nationalist populist party would be great even if I don’t see the GOP ever becoming one.

                        Jack Dobson said: “So a major nationalist populist party would be great even if I don’t see the GOP ever becoming one.”The key word here ismajor.There’s a reason the Green Party will never elect a president. Same thing with the Libertarians. Numbers. And if you take a good look at third party politics in general, you see a hundred years of wasted effort. But your not actually talking about starting an American Nationalist Populist Party. Because that would mean opening the doors to every race, creed, color and natural perversion. You want to form the new grand old white peoples party. My advice is, before you do that, put some barbed wire and machine gun nests around your house.

                            “American” and “White” are synonymous to me. When abroad not so long ago, when an Asian or Islander would refer to an “American,”  I and they both knew it meant a White. It still does.

                    Sorry but you don’t get to select the nominees any more than the rest of us.If you’re white and not voting Trump you’re de facto voting Kamala, so congratulations on supporting the same candidate as Google and Soros and the WHO and the ADL and the FBI and SPLC etc. I’m sure they appreciate your support.It doesn’t matter though right, since it makes no difference anyway, it’s just a super coincidence that they’re all on the same side that you’re taking. You’re still mad and disappointed and you expressing your feelings is what counts.So take your ball and go home, pretty good chance you live in a red city so you won’t get pulled out of your car and beaten on the way there.

            That woman is absolutely awful and the neocons love her. A Republican can be as progressive as they come, so long as they support Israel and tax breaks.I had a long in-person conversation with a normiecon the other day and now that I generally avoid political conversations outside of the internet (because Orange Man BAD), I had forgotten just how bad they are. They were going on about taxes and our bestist buddy in the Middle East and how we have to fight the Muslims there so as to not fight them here.  And this is a guy who is woke on the race issue, it’s how the conversation started!

        It really is a shame, what’s happened and happening to traditional White America.  Decades ago, we all just took it for granted that things would continue on as they always had and never change.  We’d generally be fair to most everyone, but run the show.  Well, that’s been taken advantage of and here we are, being quickly shown the door and no gumption to fight back.

            The “fight back” is — in words that I’m sure @Lineman would echo– is to form communities of our own, and support our own.
This means creating networks of like-minded people IN REAL LIFE first, and then moving + building + supporting from there.

                    One thing we may have in our favor is that, at least “so I have heard” is that the American Negro has a deep fear of the country, and a preference for the city. Supposedly and at least sounds valid, bad cultural memories of slavery or sharecropping and better family stories after (Great-)Grandpa moved the family to the big city where he could work a factory job fo’ mo’ money.

        To be fair who would want to align themselves with what remains of the white majority. We’re hopelessly fractured, degenerate and mostly to completely insane. The only reason any of us are in it is because we know it’s a Skins game and are interested in hopefully not being beaten to death and seeing the continuation of our race.

Seriously, did you see videos of the protest at the Postmaster Generals house?? First, so crazy that they are protesting the Postmaster General but also that was the whitest crowd I’ve seen since going to the met opera in HD on Saturday afternoon

                            The protests- ever since the pussyhat era- are our women, dancing naked with flowers in their hair, on a hilltop in Greece.

Down below, the men are in battle.
What do they fight to the death for for? That hilltop.

When the battle is done, the women know the men still alive will come up that hill to claim their prize…

And the women shall then claimtheirprize: the winners.

                People who think with their cnuts.In the black hand, per the wiring diagram we call “palmistry”, 85% of black men have a line so common to them I call it the “Negro line”.A better name? “Entitlement”.That insufferable, basaltic sense of self-importance is catnip to certain owners of another line, until they get beat up and dumped.That other line I call the “women’s line”, from their pinkie to the base of the palm, the base of the spinal cord “life” line.From ‘perception’ to crotch, that line is. They listen to their bodies, and think with their cnuts.Men’s attitude, to them, is what a nice behind is to us. They can’t help but look, and negro skills are entirely social.(Whites are cold and weird, because we have mechanical brains.  We can’t read people like maps, as blacks can, while they will never invent a blueprint.)

            There are still some white owned gas stations particularly in rural areas.
I know where they all are. Do I make a difference on my frequent road trips? Dunno but it feels good to enter a store and smile and chat with the wrinkly old white lady with the smokers voice.
There are many areas where dissidents can do things like this with just a little effort/planning.

                I usually go to the local hardware but the other day went to a small plumbing supply for a sink part. Three men over fifty and the masks were off. Just the level of interaction with my own kind and the attention they gave me to help was satisfying.It felt like the old days going with my dad to tv repair and testing tubes and such. Soon all of this will be gone like tears in the rain.

                    When I go to the local hardware store, I feel like I’m back in my granddad’s basement with all of the parts organized and labeled. All the employees are white guys the age I remember granddad at who can answer your questions about where things are. Try that with a vibrant employee, or a young one.

                    I stopped at the equipment rental today to pick up a skid steer, and while they had the required plexiglass panel, nobody was wearing masks (including me), despite the statewide mask mandate. It was good to see.

            Indians barely make up 1.2% of the population. How many Indians spy for the government back home, compared to Chinese researchers copying technology for the CCP?
I’m sorry sir, but your hatred is putrid. Indian Americans are proud Americans first, and many of them do support the GOP. I’m certain that there are more Indian Republicans than Chinese Republicans. I doubt many South Asians even consider Harris to be one of their own; you can cite a few far-left Indian activists to make your claim, but plurality of anecdote is not data.

        Should have talked to Canadians… we could have warned you about Indians even 20 or 30 years ago. We’ve had them for a long time. We have more Sikhs though, not sure about the Brahmin class.Either way, everything Z says is correct. While the women can be sweet, the men are shameless, inept, nepotistic, and corrupt. Their only benefit is that they ruined the club scenes by being creepy, thus reducing white degeneracy.I maintain that Indians are the worst possible group… whites will look back fondly on the days the only coloured group they had to worry about were blacks rioting and Mexicans coming in illegally.

            Indians are not a “group”—at least not racially.  David Reich in his book “Who We Are and How We Got Here” has a couple chapters (IIRC) on the subcontinent of India.  The typical precepts on race found elsewhere do not hold up when applied to India.  In short, the continent is composed of *many* races.  But the 5 major ones overlay the ancient Indian “cast” system quite nicely.  Brahmins being on the top of the heap.  It is that cast that we see most often over here, and around the world.  That is why we can have so many successful ones from a country with an average IQ in the mid 80’s—they ain’t the Brahmins.

            Nimrata has 2 kids.
Indian women are generally ambivalent to having kids. They usually have 1 or 2 if they do have any.
It’s a 1-2 punch strategy. Indian women fit in with the Karen’s and nice white ladies. They sleep with white men. This disarms us.
They still marry tribal and nepotistic husbands. All their bases are covered when screwing over whites.

Indian men are almost uniformly beta. They either don’t know their wives have been riding the c*ck carousel or are so pleased to have landed a co-ethnic hottie that they don’t care.I grew up in Nova, and 1 out of 20 South Asian guys were cool. The rest were unusual in different ways but largely oblivious to the fact. We’d make fun of them and the cute South Asian chicks lapped it up.

            You are missing the point: “true colors” doesn’t count for much.  Obama pretended to be black, and it went great for him. The fact that he was about as A-A as Hirohito didnt end up mattering.  Ditto with Caramela Harris – she aint white, she says she hates whitey, and thats good enough for them.  Remember: its a skins game, and her team is easy to spot.

        You forgot to mention that South Asians buy the McMansion down the street to house three generations and then burn their garbage in the back yard because why pay the garbage company?  Another thing about South Asians, is that they came into an American culture where success in the corporate suites is dominated by who is more entitled, more arrogant, and malleable to a pecking order. and basically more full of shit.  They’re able to sell their degrees from Hydrooxycontinbad University (worse than a JC in the states) as some Indian version of Harvard.  These factors bring a stunning closed mindedness that shows why India is a living hell on earth.   East Asians have two strikes against them.  They’re not pushy.  They’re closed minded but not arrogant.  In the corporate dynamic that makes them highly skilled workhorses that are the last to get the raise, the promotion or the respect.  If your company has a lot of south Asians it’s likely 1) old and established.  2). On a slow decline, with its best years a decade or two earlier.  3). more bureaucratic than competitors.  4). survives on buying the competition over internal patents and new ideas.  That pajeet that runs Microsoft can dress like Steve Jobs in a ripped off dark t shirt and jeans look, but he’s not Steve Jobs and never will be.   When Silicon Valley has its next bubble pop, some of the most South Asian laden companies will have the biggest layoffs.  A high interest rate environment would clean a lot of this mess up.

        The Curries, as we call them here in Australia, are taking over every business they can get their hands on or opening a spice shop/ restaurant. Generally, what once were reputable establishments crumble in quality.


Another unfortunate consequence is if you end up living next door to an Indian family (which is becoming more inevitable) and being exposed to the putrid smells of the cuisine being concocted. I knew a guy who couldn’t open up the house because of the aroma wafting in from next door.

            One of the many reasons we changed apartments in Singapore was because the Indian maids would go out on the balconies or in the stairwell (all concrete and marble tiles, minimal insulation) at 6 AM to start pounding their spices.

        Agreed about E. Asians, Z. Even in Toronto where they have huge numbers, they’re increasingly invisible from everything. They self segregate to their own neighborhoods and are pretty much invisible unless you go there. Universities are increasingly full of Indians/arabs not Chinese.The E. Asian population is aging rapidly – go visit any Chinese area in Toronto and you’ll notice many greyhairs, many groups of apparently childless 40 and year olds, and very few children. The low birth rate is catching up to them.It’s quite possible that they’re genetically incapable of understanding diversity or our modern mosaic. They seem bewildered by all our “diversity”, to be honest. They can’t even fathom why someone would want it.A few westernized ones become radical blm/sjw – probably also don’t understand what they’re doing but they’re just fitting in.I honestly feel quite bad for them. I’ve never hated Chinks or Japs – I respect them. I wish for them to go back to China, for their benefit and mine. It’s a clown world.

        “In Asia, South Asians are as tribal as Jews are in the West, while East Asians are about as tribal as white people.”  The people interacting with (or living under) the Han Chinese merchant class in Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia would disagree with that assessment.  As would anyone who’s lived in China, Japan or Korea.  East Asians may be less tribal than the South Asians, but they’re significantly more tribal than whites.

        Damn, this post has gotten under my skin.  By referencing the One Drop Rule in my (if finally approved) other post, I didn’t mean to deny Zman’s general thesis about identity politics.  It is simply that history is replete with the folly of race mixing.  Just as the pure Castilian blood of the conquistadors did not enoble their mestizo children, the key distinction of South African apartheid was not between coloureds and blacks, but whites and all others.  As the signs in Afrikaans frequently read: “Net Blankes!” (Whites Only).Just as the Spaniards had the concept of “limpieza de sangre” (purity of the blood), we Americans used to have segregation and Jim Crow laws and, if there had to be some sop to the Declaration’s “all men are created equal” rhetoric, Plessy v. Ferguson.  A hundred years ago no one had any difficulty accepting that this was a White nation, built by Whites to be enjoyed by Whites and to perpetuate our existence and well being.  Again, South Africa demonstrated that even a minority can rule with this attitude but that we surrender it to our peril.  Is it too late to wake our people from their slumber?

            At least in those days, the Spanish colonists had a complex chart to base rights upon how much admixture (mestizo) you had.  I believe it was at least into the 4th generation before all rights were granted a mixed race person.  They seemed to intuitively know just how many “drops” made the soup toxic.  😉

        Can confirm. Note how Chinese – even those who barely speak English – tend to adopt fake American names. For every Jia, there’s a Danny; for every Chun, a Shawn. They also, if they are women, tend to marry Whites. Completely different from Indians.A friend works at a Regional Bank in the South. While the very top is still White men, the Chief Data Officer is Indian, and is filling the analytics group with Indians. Same with the CTO. Meanwhile, the standards they hold Whites to are entirely different. They had an IT screw up, I’m told, and immediately fired the White guy responsible, though this screw up was of the type that literally nobody else is held responsible for. The Whites in IT were very matter-of-fact about it: he got fired because he was White.

        I dunno, I would consider East Asians, especially Koreans, as pretty ethno-centric, but they do have a strong pragmatic and conformist streak which prevents their people from being ghettoized in foreign countries. (Chinatowns notwithstanding, those I would hardly call those places ghettoes.) Z is right that they are adopting evangelical Christianity in large numbers, which does draw them closer to white Americans in culture and politics. But they’re not civic nationalists quite yet.

            We have a lot of Koreans here in Lagos. The older ones are quite sensible on race and not shamed to say it. The younger ones get indoctrinated quite easily into multiculturalism. The trouble for the young ones is they are never accepted and not very good at the skins game. They also are preyed on by blacks like no other group.

Either racist or cuck. There is little middle ground because we just didn’t evolve for it.
Derb’s artic alliance is pretty dumb (and a cope) but NW whites and east asians have some similar traits. E. Asians are even more conformist than whites.
We’re all dying – E. Asians low (extinction level) birth rate and gradual globohomo acceptance. White death, slightly less low birth rate and mass immigration for us.

                    Artic alliance! The Ice People versus the Sun People, who never invented so much as a wheel or an alphabet.From the perspective of ancient history, today’s Z-article is absolutely fascinating in its implications.The Fall of the Ehdeen drove our Aryan half from their steppe homelands: stocky, warlike Aryan redhairs merged with slender Hyperborean blondes in the west, were absorbed by Dravidian abos in the east, and met stubborn semitics in the south who could not defeat them, yet declared a perpetual war without weapons, a women’s war.Those became priests and poisoners, herdsmen using the power of the womb, cultivating cushy jobs in administration- the original HR catladies, who tear apart every civilization they enter.

Also, the Taurim Basin pyramids, with white Scythian mummies, built in western China a thousand years before the East Asians ever showed up.
(See also the Bosnian pyramids, mistaken for a mountain range until the aerial photographs.)

Now you know why their last thread, the Uyghers, are being erased by that conquered tool, (((Communist)))-molded China.

                I attended a university with many South Koreans and one thing that astonished me was how much they defended  and identified with their Northern brethren. I think it was completely due to racial solidarity. Many were from Seoul, which is in spitting distance of the DMZ.I didn’t detect anything other than lip service to multi-culturalism from them although they would glob onto it as a way the get the upper hand over Whites. This obviously was the tactic used by Jews. There was a lot of visible hostility toward blacks and restrained dislike of Whites.That was a long time ago, though, so maybe the indoctrination has worked its wonders on them now.

                        I was there in LA’s South Central every week, in Maxine Water’s district.
Those decrepit, black-owned slum stores were replaced by enterprise-zone Korean warehouses,  with 10 foot iron fences and gleaming gold Korean letters, and the bank Maxine owns did very well, indeed.
Rooftop Koreans were left alone- because Maxine was pulling a Nero, a Neropolis.

Before Nero, Cicero and Tacitus warned us about Nero’s backers, the (((property developers))).

They are pulling a BLM gentrification today, devaluing the best real estate for a their bank, the Federal Reserve, to grab.

Mnuchin committed hundreds of financial crimes in the Southland, typical for the Hollywood Empire.

Guess the ethnicity of the couple who declared a drought to grab the Kern basin supplying water to all of LA, with Jerry Brown as their Nero, for example.

                                Interesting allegations. I recall similar from the 1993 ? Rodney King riots. It depressed real estate and yet within a few years it had recovered nicely. The “conspriacy theory” version of this, as I recall was that the CIA (of course) supplied drugs to the ghetto, causing the crime waves, culminating with the riots. In the aftermath, brave buyers (Mexicans? Asians?) bought in, presumably getting loans from the rich Jewish bankers of course. Manipulating social dysfunctions or not, makes you wonder if they’re doing an upscale version of this.

                    That sounds right. A friend of mine married into Army and lived in the Seoul area for 2-3 years. (In approx 2010-2013.)One of her observations was similar to what you are saying: they aren’t interested in making friends with the Americans who are inhabiting their land.They are very aware of their Korean-ness, and kept to themselves.And of course, being white and taller than many of them, my friends stood out anyway.

                        The South Koreans for the most part dislike the Americans stationed there. US troops usually are just outright ignored but sometimes it gets uglier. If a war were to break out at the DMZ, based on what I experience, many in the South would root for their co-ethnics in the North if ROK troops were not fighting alongside the US trooper (which in part is why there tends to be showy displays on Korean television of Americans and South Koreans training together).

                    When I was teaching in Seoul in 1996, I had one student (university age) tell me that he couldn’t wait for the peninsula to be reunified.  When I asked why he said, “Because then we will have the largest military in East Asia and we willmake Japan apologize!”

                        This.  Hatred of Japan drives much of their mindset.  It’s not entirely groundless, after all if the Japanese spent a generation looting, raping, and murdering in California before their defeat, Americans would probably have a different view of them too.

                            Two words: “comfort women”.

The Japanese were brutal, as only Asians can be brutal.
I learned that reading a book by an Indian POW captured by them.

They used POWs as live fire targets in India, too. The Indians haven’t forgotten.

                            So were Germans in Europe when I was there in the 60’s.  We arrived in Frankfort and rented a German car to tour in.  Strange things began to happen after we left Germany proper.At time people would scream something we could not make out as they crossed in front of us and such stuff.  Autobans had cars pass us and blow horns and such.Finally in Holland, a younger Dutchman was raising hell as we waited on a light and I rolled the window down and said hello.  The response in Dutch from the somewhat surprised youth was, “What’s an American doing in Holland in a big fucking Mercedes?”At that point it dawned on me what the hell was going on and I never inquired again, although later on the Dutch relatives had a good laugh when we drove up to their homes.  They never would have thought about renting a big ass German car outside of Germany—and they told us so with a laugh.

            The Koreans may be adopting Christianity, but I would disagree that draws them closer to White Americans.  They instead combine an aggressive racial and cultural pride with churchian moral superiority (for a prime example, see commenter ‘Twinkie’ at Unz).  Even those who intermarry remain assured their children combine the best of both cultures (although like all who miscegenate, they consider their offspring to appear primarily White whereas European Whites can immediately tell they’re mixed).

Mexicans are Amerindians with European admixture. AA’s are Africans with European admixture. The greater (of the relevant portion of the genome) the percentage of European they have in them, the smarter they are. The same pattern would manifest if Africans and Amerindians were mixing with high IQ East Asians. This is a direct consequence of the high polygenicity of the intelligence trait.

            Abrams was too off-putting for middle America Whites. Whites want a black who speaks like a White with a just a hint of negro sassiness in their voice. (You can bet the Obama worked on his accent and diction.) Normie Whites also are okay with a bit of racial talk but they want their pet black to not push it too hard and to always say that we can work together to get things right, i.e. this won’t last forever.You’d think that the Dems could find a few blacks to play that role, but they’re just aren’t that many of them. Obama will a Godsend for them. They’re having a hard time finding another.

                    She only looks Black because of the admixture of typical American Blacks.  She’s really not Black, not in race, nor in color.  She is not much—if any darker—than the typical South Asian “Indian” we had in my old department.  And of course, her facial features are defiantly non-Black.  As Z-man adroitly points out, her failure to identify as Black will not gain votes on that side of the equation.  It may however gain from that segment of the poz’d Whites who still hope to redeem themselves.

                        Kamalas are found in large numbers in Jamaica and anywhere the British imported Han and pajeets for work/bureaucracy. What’s considered their ‘white’ upper class is almost never really White – they all have a bit of black, Chinese, and Indian mixed in. That said, while the racial mix varies, the character does not. I’ve dealt with them in the US, the UK, Asia, and the Caribbean – all equally unpleasant.

                Abrams was too off-putting for the White Libs.  They like their “blacks” to not be too “black”, and to pay homage to the people who put them there.  Black lack of agency, indeed.  Obama pushes the envelope on black rhetoric, but always remembers who got him his gig. Harris will play the “black” game as well.  But Stacey was actually black, and uncompromising about it.  Uncompromising is OK for others, such as Omar, AOC, and Rashid.  But not for blacks, according to the Liberal rulebook.

        Seems that the east Asians and the south Asians are not the best of buddies. I’ve worked with both in engineering organizations over the past 35 years and never saw them socialize with each other very much. I’ve never heard of each tribe’s diaspora in the other’s home nation. Then there is that border dispute between India and China.

                If the hereditarians are correct, the animus is not only racial. The “East asians”, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Koreans, are tops in IQ. The southeast Asians are a bit worse. I’m not sure about India, it is such a cultural mish-mash. In any case, as Apu would have said, “Thank the many gods that we are not Negroids.”

                    I was listening to a Barnhardt podcast recently (#118, I think) and she discussed what you are touching upon:There is an entire ‘conflict’ in the Black community about skin tone, skin lightening (or not), hair (naps or relaxer), and more.Like: if you happened to be born with lighter skin, then you might get made fun of by the darker folks. But on the other hand, it was out of envy, because a caramel or honey is better than …. crap… in the wider culture when dealing in yt’s world.It’s apparently awhole big thingthat we just don’t have in the European culture.

                        As I’ve commented elsewhere, blacks want to be blackish.  They celebrate their exaggerated curves and mouths, but want White hair, varying eye color, and a ‘medium’ complexion.  With today’s photoshopping, particularly in fashion ads, the skin tone of White and black models is almost identical. Yet another way of promoting White extinction.

                Nothing new. In the Buddhist “Pali Canon,” (ca. 500 BC) one of the attributes of the Brahmin is their paler skin. Buddha was very egalitarian in speaking about the different castes, yet physical traits (including skin) are found among the several traits of the Blessed One.

            This seems to be a “thing” everywhere, among many different cultures. Was its origin a distinction between outdoor workers v. indoor workers?  It’s probably a lot of different factors (including hair straightening and bleaching.) The “what” is less interesting than the “why.” And why it persists especially among the most group-identity groups.

                I’m not sure how light-skinned preference evolved in India, but it definitely signified social class among our ancestors. Women in particular took care to remain very white in Britain and the U.S., especially in the South, where the intense sunshine made it easy to turn darker if one wasn’t careful.
A pale epidermis showed that a woman was from an aristocratic or prosperous bloodline, which almost by definition meant a strongly “indoor” lifestyle. The working class mostly had to spend time outside, especially before factories were widely established.

        Z, you are giving way too much importance to my fellow south asians.  The kind of south asians in America (mostly upper class variety) have one thing in common, they listen and obey to authority, that’s what they have done to all invaders to India over past 2500 years, they were the first to convert to Islam leaving their lower class brethren to fight and suffer.  30 years go in any college it was common to see rich Indian kids of doctors splashing their 911s doing to their best to look white, because that was the power structure of the day, aka upper crust whites.  Now they are at the forefront of anti white mobs.  Tomorrow if whites had an ounce of strength and started fighting back, these people will be the the first to buckle.

            It would be interesting to see a comparison of successful/unsuccessful arranged marriages as vs marriages of “love”.  I’m not convinced arranged marriages are all that “backward”.  Certainly, the ones I’ve seen were not disparaged by the participants.

                There is a middle ground between “arranged” marriages and running off with the one you love.  It could be described as “approved” marriage, where the mom and dad of each marriage partner were asked for permission, and they held a power of approval or disapproval.  Not arranged, but the wisdom of age and experience of the parents, along with a knowledge of what a good match for their child would be, meant that stupid marriages were avoided.  Our culture used to widely practice it.

                    Dutch – Very well said.  Nothing wrong with physical attraction, but young starry-eyed lust does not tend to make for a lasting relationship.  With properly chaperoned means of meeting and socializing, Whites can make their own spousal choices with community guidance and parental approval. It was the Western pattern for centuries, until the deliberate social upheaval post WWII.

                    Dutch, very perceptive. Oddly enough, my daughter’s fiancé took me to lunch and asked permission to propose. Who the hell does that anymore?Anyway, it was a great way to break the ice and discuss what I thought (at my advanced age and experience) as to what the pro’s and con’s were with marriage and the partnership it entails. Not sure he did more than listen, but hell that’s a win these days. 😉  I later found out, he also asked permission of my wife as well, but they agreed to say nothing before speaking with me.  Guess he was sort of working up the ladder so to speak.

                    Agreed – “approved marriage” where the parents’ counsel has weight or veto power is the prime position.If I did have to choose between marriage for love or arranged marriage I would go with love. I consider it much more eugenic. Arranged marriage is part of what makes South Asians the way they are – narrow, slavish, with everything geared toward the acquisition of wealth and status through subservience. Marriage for love traditionally promotes genes that have some daring, gallantry, and genuine charisma.

                See  “The Art of Choosing”, written by a Westernized Indian female, calledSheena Iyengar. It explains a study that proves that arranged marriages work better than marriages because of love.The first ones start with mediocrity and improve more and more. The second ones start very good and degenerate very quickly. I guess the causes may be lower expectations and lack of previous sex experience

            Probably not. Hate to blackpill here but from what I’ve seen NW whites are just not equipped for that.
Italians are. There are still Italian families living happily in non white areas that all other whites fled long long ago (in Toronto).
It’s the racist vs. Cuck gene. Why are we here while the majority of whites are cucks? I don’t know why, I’m NW euro but different than most others. I can also do okay navigating a multi ethnic environment. Goodwhites cannot.
In an all white environment the racist vs. Cuck genes aren’t apparent.

                Spanish and Greeks are tribal and nepotistic too.  So are various East European peoples.   The correlation is with prolonged contact with Muslims.  They had to become tribal and insular to survive.   Northwest Europeans (Germanic and Celtic peoples) lacked that kind of millennia long friction.  They fought and to some extent interbred with each other.  Along the way they developed a high tolerance for outsiders and a deference to authority that Southern and Eastern Europeans did not.

                As reently as a couple generations ago Whites had just such a thing, the results of which current Whites are constantly shamed for.
blackpillers tend to be so because they make the mistake of thinking biological differences make people into character classes like video games with no change possible over time which is dumb.

                As Dino points out, white sub-ethnicities that had long periods of unpleasant contact with orher races have developed those attitudes.  Southern Italians and the moors, Russians and the turks, Southerners and blacks.  It can be Reconstructed out of your people, though, with enough time, money, and government education.

            Are Whites and East Asians capable of developing a healthy, aggressive ethnocentrism in the face of other surging tribes?Have you even read any history at all? Look what we did to the Prussians when they decided that it was the Germans’ turn for a spot in the sun.The reason whites are cucked, is that for 200 years we’ve been utterly invincible, soaring so stratospherically far above all other competitors, that we stopped seeing them as competition, rather as something closer to pets.Genetically, NW Europeans are among the fiercest warriors in the world. The British didn’t conquer a fifth of the planet just because they had muskets and the brown people had spears, but because an English musketman could be trained to stand 50 yards in front of the French line and reload twice a minute while the enemy volleys are striking down his comrades left and right.There’s an anecdote about British general Hugh Gough, when the British were at the point of losing a battle to the ferocious Sikhs. Upon learning that they had run out of cannonballs, Gough remarked: “Thank God! Finally we may go at them with bayonets!”As for the East Asians and aggressive ethnocentrism… Dude, how can you even?

It’s not just the ruling class, it’s the general attitude whites have towards race: they don’t really care, because deep down they know they’re on top of the stack, and half of us in here, only care because everybody else is so obsessed about it.

My original statement stands. It’s the ruling class that makes the decisions about who’s in and who’s out. They never have to suffer for the policies. They live in an entirely different world than we do. You are nothing but a “human resource” Mr. Krull. To be used as they see fit. Nothing more. And until the white folks understand that, they will continue to be used and then discarded. It’s that simple.

That statement is true by the definition of “ruling class”, everything in your post is true.
But ruling classes change all the time, especially in times with rapid changes.

There’s only so many ways to run a government. Chickens and wolves understand this. And so do peple who haven’t been marinated in all manner of maudlin sentimentalitys. People either want survive or they don’t. For a number of reasons, your average white guys are the least likely to band togather for self-protection unless there in the throes of some kind of religiopolitica ecstasy. In prison, black people stick together and so do most latinos. But the only white people that stick up for each other are the bikers and white supremacists. So even when it’s a matter of life and death, most white guys just want to keep their heads down and muddle through.

The main reason being that Normie America doesn’t feel existentially threatened by BIPOC, so they see no need to band together and defend themselves on a racial level.
Annoyed yes, inconvenienced yes, harassed yes, shot in the head when riding your bicycle yes, but being actually afraid that blacks or Hispanics are going to take over America?
Not so much.

Granted, my experience with American correctional facilities are limited but that’s not what I’ve heard. I’ve heard that going to a hardcore American prison is the ultimate HBD-pill, that you figure it out in 24 hours.
Also, when it comes to picking a school for their offspring, white people suddenly seem extremely race savvy. (#NotAll)

                                                        Felix Krull said: “A bunch of whores got thot patrolled – in Cologne, there were something like two cases that sort of merited the label “rape”. Nothing compared to your quiet Wednesday night in an average American city.”Tisk tisk Herr Krull. You shouldn’t make statements that can be so easily fact checked and refuted. Ever sence the maximum mother opened the flood gates to the brown hordes, Germany has been on the long and inevitable slide into shitsville. One day soon the EU will let Erdogan the Caliph dump two million more sand flies right in your lap. Time for Europeans to figure out where they want to Immigrate. But not to Britain, their worse off the you are.

Reported, rapes mind you – it doesn’t say how many convictions were handed down.Oh wait, I found out!Two people were convicted for “sexual assault”, whatever that means.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl04r1OjRQsIn fact, the Cologne incident puzzled me quite a bit back when. I tried to find footage or hard sources, but came up empty: the girls got pussygrabbed by a bunch of Mohammadans and had their phones stolen, that’s 99% of the stories.With the media routinely covering up immigrant crimes, how come this almost routine NY celebration got so much airplay? It had the feel of a staged media outrage.Ever sence the maximum mother opened the flood gates to the brown hordes…Merkel didn’t open the gates,the gates had been open since the early sixties and Merkelmerely announced that they were open. Every European head of state since the mid-eighties is complicit, Merkel just takes the blame because the public wants to put a face on it.Time for Europeans to figure out where they want to Immigrate.Oh dear, is this about our conversation from Sunday?

            A common trait among Haley, Ponnuru, D’Souza, name it, is the treachery combined with obsequiousness. To use an old Appalachian line, I wouldn’t trust a one of them in a a shithouse with a muzzle on.

        Interesting, but I think you’re wrong re: the black reaction to the Biden-Harris ticket. I’ll bet they get at a minimum the same percentage of the vote as Clinton (Bill) and won’t be far off Obama’s. Turnout will also be high because of BLM (which was the whole point).I think Harris’ problem will be with white people, especially white males — just like Clinton (Hillary). I actually think Senile Joe’s choice made his victory less likely than more so.

            There is starting to be some empirical evidence in the form of polls that blacks dislike Harris. We kind of knew it from the primaries already. Black women see her as a whore, black men as every other uppity semi-black woman they have to suffer.
Still, I don’t look for some magic black vote to go to Trump. Instead, many will stay at home. I don’t think Biden will do as well as Clinton with blacks. And, yes, the choice hurt him but let’s face it–someone made that pick other than Biden.

                “Black women see her as a whore, black men as every other uppity semi-black woman they have to suffer.”  That’s an over-thought cliche that might’ve held some truth 4 years ago.  Today POCssee her as a POC and that’s all that matters.  They’re all going to vote Kamala-Biden.

                Well, we’ll see. I haven’t seen any polls myself showing blacks don’t like Harris (they may exist, but I haven’t seen them) But Harris attended a HBCU and is a protege of Willie Brown — so she has a very black background, even if she’s a high yellow at best.Glad we agree that Trump isn’t going to get a magic black vote though — why people persist in believing that fantasy is beyond me….

            In evolution, what persists is what “works”; in the sense that it enhances the survive and thrive imperative of any longstanding subspecies. The “tribalism” trait (really proclivity bias) evolves in environments that necessitate that social feature. IOW, South Asian tribalism exists because it worked well for them on the Indian peninsula over the long run, and not because some arbitrary group behavior was consciously agreed to by the members.

        Observe and analyze. The Democrats are pretending to run Dementia Joe and Kamala token-POC. Even the brain-dead know that that is not a winning combo. So why do it? Answer, crash and burn in 2020 sets up rise of real tyranny in 2024. That will be the year the masks come off and things get real. What can we expect? Most whites will piss and moan, some will join militias, and a relative few will actually figure out how to fight and win.

            They are running them because it is a no lose situation.  If Trump happens to pull it out, then the Dems burned two back-benchers, no great loss.  They know, as well as we do, there is no post-Trump GOP.  On the other hand, if the Slow/Blow ticket happens to win, well then, Christmas came early.

        Zman I love your essays but I must take exception with your comments about Michelle Obama. She is anything but a “very typical black woman”. Your typical black woman even born in the 1960s does not grow up in a nuclear family with a full-time mother and a middle-class employed father. Nor does she attend Princeton and later Harvard Law and become a lawyer. Never mind the rest of her career.  To steal a line from the cartoon Boombox both Michelle and Barak represent the typical American black about as much as a polar bear represents the typical American white. 😛

        The Indians are an unusual case. While they are most definitely tribal, they, in contradistinction to blacks, actually tend to like and even admire whites.Back when I was an undergrad student there was a semi-pretty Indian girl in my Russian language class. We were very friendly with one another, but I wasn’t really interested in her. Anyway, one night I walk into a convenient store to buy a pack of smokes, and the Indian girl was behind the counter. Well, she got very friendly with me, talking very flirtatiously and batting her big brown eyes. Then, suddenly, the smile ran away from her face, she became very withdrawn and said she had to get back to work. It was then that I looked in a back corner of the store and saw three young Indian men, who I took to be her relatives. They were looking me three shades of hell. Heh. Point of the story is I could have had that girl with ease, her brothers new it, and absolutely did not approve. If I had been an Indian, the story would have been quite the opposite, I think.

        In some good news, even the guys at PowerLine, who are the ultimate BoomerCons, are starting to open their eyes to the new reality of American Diversity.
https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2020/08/todays-democratic-party.php
The PowerLine guys need to remain respectable so they can only go so far, but they definitely have a toe in the water with this post.
The comment section is even more based. Numerous commenters openly discussing the possibility of (and necessity of) political violence to counter the Left, including calls to open fire on the protestors. This would have been unthinkable in Conservative World in 2008. This is progress.

                As much as we like to bitch and moan about the other ethnic groups in the West, none to my knowledge even come close to the crime and violence of Blacks. Latinos, maybe a distant second in the USA. In fact, unless I’ve missed something, I have not heard a single reference to Indian or Asian crime in the US or Canada, in today’s posts.

            I live around a few Indians, and you’re right, they’re not all that bad to live around. It’s just that they keep coming and their numbers keep growing and in big numbers I don’t want to live around them.

                I live around the South Indians too. I don’t feel the danger I would living around blacks but if they keep increasing in numbers I am leaving.I don’t want to live in New Delhi even if it’s populated by McMansions.

                    I know a lot of many dot Indians and I like the overwhelming majority of them. I find them friendly, easy to get along with, and hard working. My closet friend in high school was Indian. Now having said all that, I hate the way they vote and being non-Western, non-Christian I don’t want to see them here in huge numbers.

        “This is why South Asians get one of their own installed on the Democratic ticket, while East Asians are discriminated against by the Ivy League.”This is incorrect. Ivy Leagues don’t treat South and East Asians differently. East Asians just make a bigger fuss, whereas South Asians don’t really care about the affirmative action issue. I doubt many South Asians even consider Harris to be one of their own; you can cite a few far-left Indian activists to make your claim, but plurality of anecdote is not data. In fact, I’ve found first-generation more East Asians refusing to assimilate, whereas South Asians I know get along well with their white colleagues in the workforce. Finally, Indians aren’t really a monolith as you perceive them to be; Indians from one part of the country usually dislike Indians from other parts. I don’t know where your soft spot for East Asians comes from (probably have an Asian wife?), but your understanding is rather incomplete. In fact, many Chinese researchers were found to spy for the CCP; how many Indians spy for the government back home?

        Trivia Dept.: I’m one, not necessarily the sole, facetious user of™ or ®. Tonight, I asked myself, “Gee Layabout, what be the difference?” Well, according to one web site, ™ means the intent to use a term as a trademark although not necesarily legally registered as such, while ® means it has actually been registered. For any corporate attorneys here, I hope you will understand that my use of either is purely for satire purposes. Nonetheless, in the future I will try to use “Melanic Hominid™” vice “Melanic Hominid®”. If someone wishes to actually trademark the term, I have no objection and you may serve a cease-and-desist as soon as you have registered it  🙂

        and even then, the East Asians screw the traditional whites over anyway, other than whatever remains of the South Vietnamese. besides, even if lefty, Yang is Taiwanese, a very Americanized country source of golf-club Asians really affable to Americans, the kind of Asians which are an increasing minority otherwise. the CCP-lovers of his kind are in the ascendance, and they will be more belligerent not only to whites but to the bindis eventually, or otherwise ally but impose on them. of course, all Asiatics at least attempt to deal with and out-Jew the Jews, sons of Cam after all.that said, nice to see finally a race article that is not just about inherited genetics and iq, and more about the historical ethnic evolutions of these peoples and characters. of course the bindis make better dem footsoldiers, just look at their style of haphazard corporate socialdemocracy back home. over there they particularly are adept to portray the usual corrupt elite politicians as being for the people; here in the US they hope to achieve the same trick, with Kamala as this phony corrupt wealthy brown immigrant that yet still has the look and social-media appeal to at least get some black millennials to vote. of course, a legit angry black woman like Stacy Abrams, or at least a still lefty and pouty enough mulatto like Obama, would have brought all the darkies out; but the nice and/or Jewy white liberals might have thought about it. at least they can attempt to negotiate with Kamala so that the hordes don’t storm liberal suburbs… for a while, or not too quickly.but like i said, the more belligerent East Asians are in the ascendance, and they are the major beneficiaries of the suits against the Ivy League, which they will use to take more livelihoods and eventually culture from whites. you forgot to mention the southeast Asians, the sort of Mexicans of that region, more humble but more basic and even primitive at times, still trouble in large amounts near.

        Are americans gonna bow down to guru-ji and ask him the nature of life? They already do. Are indians gonna destroy america’s sewege system &amp; make it smell like shit? Why not, it should smell like crap if the citizens have its colors.South asian takeover sounds ridiculous, US military complex &amp; bankers rule america, not ethnic groups who vote based on skin tone. Since when do voters make the rules?If the point was about US goverment collapsing under the weight of those many ethnic groups fighting for their petty agendas inside its borders then sure, that sounds like a probable scenario.But we all know what rises after that are not the krishna warriors.

        I have lived and worked for decades with South and East Asians and I find Z-Man’s comments to be most interesting, insightful and much food for thought. One small quibble is the reference to “India is a beef stew”!Another thing was pointed out to me by an old left-wing Jewish friend is the radicalism of younger 2nd generation South Asians. For example, look at Sawant in Seattle leading the communist revolution. Also, I understand that the leading force ofJacobin(of guillotine fame) magazine is a South Asian.

        “Despite having numbers, they lack the ethnocentrism to make those numbers translate into political power.”

I would say we forgot the ethnocentrism of our 19th century forebears, as applied to electoral politics.

So how do we recreate the Irish model of The Machine, a la Tammany Hall, or the Red Shirts?
