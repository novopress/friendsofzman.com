        “Some towns are better off dead”.
I agree completely. San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, DC, etc.

        Libertarianism is the essence of it being easier to dream than do, better to demand than achieve, better to hide than take responsibility, better to destroy than build.
None of this should surprise us, but it still does if only to the degree of the libertarian’s ignorance, faux-intensity and the endless, whining repetition of cant and dogma spewed forth in the face of reality.

        “The liberal and the libertarian look at the messy arrangements of mankind and wish to clean the slate and start anew, because to work through the current arrangements is dirty and time consuming.”
And it requires choice and compromise. Choosing means some of your supporters will be miffed. Comprise means the maturity to take a long hard look at your ideology and make decisions about what is important. To be willing to trade off your D priorities for achievement of some A and B priorities. Alas, more supporters miffed. Purity is so much easier.

        God (faith) and your fellow man (good works), I suppose.  Every human endeavor that forgets those two, seems to go astray, somehow.One of the commenters at Belmont Club quoted one of those “why didn’t I ever think of that” ideas from a book on Marxism, but the insights apply to any of the utopian cults.  Paraphrasing broadly, the author wrote that Marx had looked at religion, the family, capitalism, society, patriarchy (the rather exhaustive list can be found in his well-known Manifesto) and found them all to be riddled with human folly and imperfection.  So his solution was to eliminate them all and replace them with something not particularly well thought out.  I always kick myself in the arse for not writing the title and author down.

        The problem with Libertarianism is that the US economy is run by the rich, for the rich and they don’t subscribe to Libertarianism.

        Everyone has their trigger points.  For Bill Quick at the Daily Pundit it’s Teh Gay(for reasons which have recently become obvious), for the Z-Man is Libertairians.
Push the button and watch the froth flow.
“Charity begins at home.”  Ever heard of that?
It’s incomplete.  It should be: “Charity begins *and ends* at home”.
