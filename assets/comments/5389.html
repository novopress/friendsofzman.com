        Trump is kind of inconsequential to something larger stirring. Not to besmirch the guy.I think I would like to have a beer and a greasy cheeseburger with him. He is probably an interesting guy who is decent hearted kind of regular Joe under it all.Regardless, it really doesn’t matter. Either he is the real deal, and the sonofabitches give him a dirt nap before he becomes too large to stop, or somebody is absolutely brilliant a social engineer, and Trump is a false flag designed to mollify the restlessness of the productive slaves. After all, you would have to live under a rock on Pluto not to know its not a few who have had just about enough of the fuckers running things.Trump represents something visceral, almost palpable, something truly grass roots, what is coalescing around trump represents a great Fuckyou.

        Trump is a guy who will openly consider you a great person if you publicly agree with him, and try to call you out as an idiot if you don’t.
The Washington people of both parties will condescendingly agree to hear you out and tell you that you are a nice person, and thank you for letting them know what you think, but then call you an idiot behind your back, because you did not follow the conversation up with a big political cash contribution.
So which side would you rather deal with?

        Trump’s greatest heresy is that his is a member of the master class who has pulled aside the curtain.  One of the guys who writes the checks is spilling the beans.Pundits like Jonah Goldberg, Williamson, Will, and Krauthammer, and politicians like Jeb!, Walker, Perry, Clinton, and the rest of that sorry lot like to think of themselves as Platonic Guardians, when in fact they are highly paid servants.  The only difference between Jonah Goldberg and a Starbuck barista is the paycheck, and I’ll bet the difference is not as great as one would think, which adds to the insecurity.Instead of sitting in the back room, filling the coffers, and issuing orders, Trump is prowling the hallways and insulting the help.  It’s a mass public castration, and the castrati are wailing.This sort of thing is not supposed to happen on the Right.  As they used to say in the old WASP enclaves, it’s simply “not done”.  The glue that held the coalition together was always the idea of “aping one’s betters”.  That only works if the a modicum of social and economic mobility is the norm, as it was for much of American history.  Now that the ruling class has decided to openly defecate from the trees onto those below, the deal’s off.Kevin Williamson goes to the opera and thinks he’s Bunny Mellon.  My guess is his apartment is smaller than my garage.  Jonah Goldberg writes a column on the perfidy of banking reform and thinks he’s a Rothschild, but probably gets most of his lunches from Chipotle.  George Will pens a column advocating the invasion of Syria and thinks he’s a lost scion of the Hapsburgs, but needs a $8.00 hour Honduran to clip his hedges.  Jeb! is a bag man  for Carlos Sim; Walker’s wife is a coupon clipper; Rubio lives in big house with no furniture, like the rest of the people in his McNeighborhood.  These people don’t really do or say anything consequential, except to further screw things up, and need the illusion of worth and control to stay sane.  Trump is robbing them of their fundamental identity, and they having a breakdown.

It’s worse than you think!  At least a Stabucks barista can afford to buy pants!

        As Cernovich pointed out, people don’t like Trump that much, they love the fact he has pointed out what a bunch of cowardly cucks the GOP and its media flunkies have become.
The NR insults its readers and fires those who should have been supported. That’s why they are being deserted.

        Yeah, I think it’s pretty much the condescension of Those Who Think They Know Better. Excuse us great unwashed as we support Trump, who is willing to put his personal opinions/thoughts out there without first making sure they’ve been through the Acceptable Thought washing machine. I understand that he probably is not a warrior for Liberty, based on the many documented things he has opined upon over the years. But I get the sense that he genuinely loves this country, and does not look down on the people who get up every day and go to work, or look for work, hoping for a better life for themselves and their children. He is unafraid to say the things that need to be said, and willing to ruffle feathers without apology. Maybe his brash style will embolden others.

        I read the Sundance article rebutting Jonah Goldberg and thought it was insightful.  Goldberg’s response was pedantic and  knee-jerk without addressing the valid points made in the Sundance article.  The establishment rhinos are stewing in their own juices as it looks like that “silent majority”  may be rearing it’s “ugly”  head and not getting in line behind Yeb as  they were told to.  Uh oh,  the folks may be starting to wake up and the establishment types are scared to death.

        Exactly correct in all meaningful aspects. For the long form essay see:
http://spectator.org/articles/39326/americas-ruling-class-and-perils-revolution
In this essay Angelo Codevilla examines in detail the bifurcation of our society into the “ruling class” and “country class”, tracing its history and implications.
Me, I’m just enjoying all the splodey heads of the sanctimonious.

        Your description of Trump support is exactly what I have witnessed many times, and from thoughtful, aware people. Some have already made the leap that we cannot vote our way out of this, some have not. Either way it’s sand in your eye.
Trump is not my friend, and he is no friend of liberty. But if I am to judge him not by his friends but by his enemies, he’s the man to awaken the silent minority and break windows in Georgetown.

        I came across this interview a while back with the guy Trump hired to run his Iowa ground game. (https://www.yahoo.com/politics/trumps-iowa-field-general-is-on-a-crazy-ride-127567575916.html)It has a quote that really sums up why Trump is getting all the various depth of support that he is:“I think the reason they are supportive of the Trump effort — and I say supportive because I think they are — is because the enemy of my enemy is also my friend,” Laudner said. “I tell people, even if you don’t line up with him on everything ideologically, Trump is going to kick the door open so that the rest of us can come running through. He’s the only candidate who can really do that. I think they have to root for that because if that doesn’t happen, their agenda goes nowhere.”I think this is a lot of the reason why attacks against Trump directly don’t seem to really be fazing his supporters. They’re not supporting Trump the man, they’re supporting Trump the Movement.

            I agree. It’s a movement of people who don’t do movements because they want to be left alone to live their lives according to their own values, but who see the media, Hollywood and academia relentlessly trashing those values. It may be our last hope.
