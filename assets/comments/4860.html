        We are seeing the beginning of the end of an experiment that started with how devastated Europe was on VE Day, 1945.
The intention was to do things differently, to have an alternative to what was the result of what was done.
Well, to paraphrase the Dowager Countess, don’t mistake a wish for a certainty.
The 10 year forecast from Stratfor regarding Europe doesn’t look so far fetched now, does it?

        If Greece defaults on its Euro debts, other bankrupt nations like Italy and Ireland may do the same. That would spell the end of the EUro.
Greek governments should be forbidden from borrowing and its civil service and very generous welfare state must be curbed. That would make sense – so it wont happen.
Instead, expect civil unrest and more government distrust as they send in the teargas.

        “That means the people in charge of Europe have been lying to their public all this time. ”Ah, the penny drops. Many of us in the UK (and elsewhere in Europe for all I know) realised a long time ago there was a large amount of lying. Of course, the lies don’t seem so important when everybody is sharing some sort of prosperity, but when the truth arrives either the Euro ‘leaders’ have to confess and try to find a solution or, as we are more familiar with, the lying merely intensifies.The EU is wobbling. Even such devices as the Schengen Agreement are starting to be ignored. When nations close their borders despite all their seeming enthusiasm for open borders once, then the free-wheeling concept of ‘member states’ and shared responsibilities begins to look decidedly ragged.But here’s Europe’s problem: the Germans now have to win at the third attempt. They can’t invade Belgium as before, so the Schlieffen plan can’t be wheeled out again as Germany no longer has that many divisions. This time it’s an economic battle and failure either to ‘save’ Greece’ financially or having to kick them out of the EU represents a huge defeat. It is a lose-lose situation, and the sort of problem that lots of other politicians are glad lies on Merkel’s shoulders and not theirs.I would hesitate to say this marks the end of Europe, but unless Germany is willing to honour all debts of everyone I suspect the gradual collapse of the Schengen Agreement will be the least of anyone’s worries.
