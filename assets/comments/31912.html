        I don’t take anything “influencers” say at face value.  I am always getting links sent to me or otherwise see stories from them that are nothing short of retarded.  Just yesterday some twitter “influencer” claimed an Israeli F35 was shot down (by Russia) over the desert on the way to delivering a nuclear bomb to EMP Iran.  This is despite the fact that EMPs cannot be delivered by a plane (planes cannot fly high enough).Aside from the BS they just make up, all they really are is talking heads.  Very, very few of them do any original reporting. They aren’t out there finding scoops. They’re giving their retarded take on something being reported in the MSM.  I have absolutely zero doubt that many of them are completely compromised. At their core, they are attention and money whores.  If some government spook offers them 10k Dollars and a promise to boost them, most will take it.

        Tracey is using out-of-context snippets to make his accusations about Trump echoing the mainstream channels.  Just spinning popular tunes like a good grifter I can understand, but no grifting, no renumeration, a plentiful travel budget?  Hoo boy.  Never did trust the guy.Rufo, on the other hand, gave a good defense of himself and has credible results.You fight the battles you can win, not the whole danged war.  Any gain is a gain. Rufo’s also not a threat to the system itself, in fact helps it shed its more damaging elements.FUD-packers in a maze of mirrors?  Holy Jetsons, where’s my damm flying car, tech overlords?

                He most likely is.  That’s just the rules of the game we have at this time.
That would also make him a known quantity.  We can guesstimate how much we can get out of him.  As long as it benefits white people, or doesn’t actively harm them, I expect others to jump in and try to get their piece too, to try to use him for their own ends.

        There seems to be a pattern in the online influencer/media world. Cater to white conservatives who are desperate for attention and to not be called racist. Then, once you get GrillerCons on your side, steer them in various directions.Obviously, the Daily Wire, which I’ve never actually watched, is the prime example, but there are many others. The pedophile-looking Hanania seems like one. Tracy – whom I’ve also never read – sounds like another.The big tell for these guys is that they almost always steer people away from Trump, but, more specifically, they steer whites away from populism and white identity politics or just whites thinking of themselves as a group at all.Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure that some of these guys are genuine. Sailer seems to be colorblind CivNat true believer, but, then again, he’s not an internet phenomenon either. But it’s not a coincidence that Sailer is still allowed on Twitter/X while Jared Taylor isn’t.Again, the pattern is the same. Act like a conservative who stands up to identity politics including noting that whites are getting unfairly targeted to get a following. Once that’s established, use that influence and trust to keep whites on the reservation.

                That guy seems like he’s compromised in any number of ways. He definitely seems like the kind of guy who wants money and fame, but goodness knows what kind of compromising pictures they have of him. He screams deviant.

        I agree that a huge amount of seeming authentic individual user activity on social media is probably actually a cutout for US/Isreal/NATO deep state entities.  And, as I’ve read much maybe most of what Tracey has posted for years (and obviously think he has insightful and useful things to say), I have often also often wondered if someone is bankrolling him.  But if so that someone would be someone like the FSB or Guónbu, with instructions to tear down trust in the US deep state, and definitely not the CIA, which seeks to maintain it.Tracey’s writings are reflexively anti-authoritarian and he criticizes all aspects of the American system, especially hating on the things the CIA holds dear and exists to champion: Davos/Bilderberg, 90 year old interventionist senators, billionaires, the legacy media, the residual legitimacy of main American institutions, the CIA itself.He seems to not only not mind angry opposition but relish it.  He also seems enjoy cheesing off both rightists and leftists, and to make sure to not do too much of one at the expense of the other lest people think that he is on their side.  His latest annoying multi-day manic obsession with claiming that Trump is one of the architects of the recent massive uniparty swamp lurch ($100b for jewish wars, giving Tik Tok to jews, FISA spying) seems to be him doing his regular strafing of what he sees as MAGA sacred cows.  But I also think that he sincerely believes it.I believe that Tracey is correct that not only did Trump not publicly stand in opposition against these dismaying developments, but Trumps seems to have approved of and perhaps facilitated some of it.Where I think Tracey is off though is his seeming view that Trump currently has full free agency to choose what policies he puts his weight behind and that his current actions reflect his deepest convictions, and forgetting how much pressure he is under. My guess is, that yes Trump’s instincts are to oppose all that stuff (a belief Tracey keeps trying to claim as naive).  But if Trump openly defies the tightly-gripped deep state agenda right now, he will be bankrupted and jailed, and if he goes along, they may let him be president again.  Makes sense that the latter would be more attractive than the former.

            If what you say is correct, and I have no basis to contradict it, so what? I don’t fault Trump for playing along to save his skin, but how does that further the cause? Even if he escapes the current persecution and becomes president, why would he stop “playing along”? Even his second term would eventually end, and damocles sword will still be hanging over his head. He would sooner fink on his magatard followers than his executioners.

                You simply cannot understand world affairs until you finally realize that the CIA has always been a mere subsidiary of the Mossad &amp; the Council of the Sanhedrin.Wild Bill Donovan was never in charge of anything whatsoever; he was simply the token goyische figurehead who gave carte blanche to Morgenthau’s fifth columnists [and Morgenthau had thousands upon thousands of fifth columnists].The big question these days regards the NSA.Are there still any patriots remaining in Fort Meade?Or has the (((mind virus))) rotted them all out into a state of encephalitic demoralization &amp; despair &amp; dejection?How many tranny bathrooms are there in Fort Meade?

            While I find the whole thing amusing, my bet is American intelligence services are fueling the anti-Israel protests as part of a Color Revolution against Netanyahu. The days of unconditional love for Israel are gone.

                Jack Dodson: “…American intelligence services… fueling the anti-Israel protests as part of a Color Revolution against Netanyahu…”
Dude!!!!!
Let’s get Rabbi Solomon Friedman to fill up P0rnHμb with fully kosher versions of:
1) Somalian Jew =&gt; Khazarian Yenta pr0n
2) Eritrean Jew =&gt; Khazarian Yenta pr0n
3) Ethiopian Jew =&gt; Khazarian Yenta pr0n
I don’t think they even allow Mizrahic Jew =&gt; Khazarian Yenta pr0n.
The yentas were so d@mned h0rny that they had to officially ban the Third Reich pr0n.
I think it’s something like a felony to have a sw@stika in Khazarian pr0n.

                I would not doubt it. I recall an author pointing out that the US had financed BOTH SIDES in Vietnam…and that book was written in 1973, while the war was still winding down. That book did not dwell on military history; it was highlighting the schizophrenic nature of many government actions. Another example, that may even still be current, is (was?) the fact that the US Government on the one hand funds anti-smoking education in the name of public health, while other agencies provide agricultural assistance to crop growers including tobacco.

        “Right now, he is flaming the Trump world right now with claims that Trump is responsible for the war funding bills. It is a weird claim,”
I have no idea why you think this is unusual.  It is typical of the entire Trump era.
Trump supporters project upon Trump the idea that he is an outsider.  Then Trump supports the establishment every chance he gets, then his supporters get angry when anyone points this out.

            The evidence for that specific claim is that liars have claimed it and people who hate Trump believe it.As I type, I’m listening to a podcast where the guest is an I guess somewhat popular rightist—the “hierarchy!” kind—who calls himself “White Papers.” He just now claimed that the reason Trump ordered a bunch of McDonalds that one famous time was “explicitly to own the libs.” This is MADE UP. Trump ordered a heap of fast food to give it to a bunch of visiting boy athletes, because he knows what they like.Trump sucks in almost every way, but *every single person who opposes him* is a liar.

        All high profile information, that is to say all public information, should be distrusted to some extent. That seems to be prudent. I think this produces mass psychoses even greater than what we see today and I think the already very real psychoses we see today (trans and all that stuff and many other things) are the result of this technologically facilitated divergence between the information space and reality (when I put it like that it seems almost glaringly obvious to me). IOW the madness we see today is but the foothills. People go psychotic when they are isolated from reality. This is why Victorian boarding schools for the coming elite were so harsh. The people of the past were not idiots. But our elites and normies sure are

                MyS, that’s an excellent synopsis of the psycho-sociological tsunami which is wiping out yuge portions of the populace; the at-risk personalititties simply don’t stand a chance in its wake.About 15 years ago, I abandoned all work upon numerical analysis [basically “STEM”], and switched instead to psychological analysis, and, in muh personal life, I raised familial psychological health [to include SLEEP] above all other concerns in life.I can feel the psychosis everywhere now.People are falling apart at the seams.Mass schizophrenia rules the day.Sleep.Cardio.Diet [preferably organic].Fast.Then Sleep some moar.Keep your loved ones close; never more than an arm’s length away.

        I don’t know if many realize, but, since its inception, the CIA has always been involved with mind control. Not conspiracy theories (some of which I believe), but a cold, simple fact.

            It’s just undeniable. We know the CIA started experimenting with mind control using psychedelic drugs in the 1950s with a man named Sidney Gottlieb (sigh…) running the operation. Ten years later, youth culture was awash in those exact same drugs. Really tough to say that is a coincidence.

        I hope this isn’t too off-topic or distracting but I’ve long held the belief that the CIA is funding OnlyFans, as well as paying the media to pick out OnlyFans “content producers” and write articles about how much money they make. They do this in order to entice young women to start selling their bodies for pennies and ruin their ability to pair bond for life. The numbers they talk about in these articles simply do not make sense.We’re also pretty sure that the CIA funded a massive social media operation in service of pushing their Ukraine narrative. They called it the North American Fellas Organization – NAFO. It was clearly modeled on the Pepe/Kek social media phenomenon of 2015/2016. Despite the fact that Langley undoubtedly spent countless man-hours and reams of paper studying that phenomenon, it turned out to be really bad. The name is cringe (fellas, really? Is this 1931?), re-using the old doge meme (obviously aping the way that Pepe was taken from an unrelated comic) was lame, and it was obvious they had bot swarmers to try to influence the narrative, push war propaganda, and attack critics. I think it’s still around, but not quite what it was in 2022.

                It’s not about the blackmail or embarrassment but about the  negative effects of degrading yourself online for money. It’s about the negative of paying for pictures of women online. Two people degrading themselves in front of a screen instead of talking to each other and maybe pairing up, or just learning how to converse with other people of the opposite sex. There are podcasts out there that interview top OF “creators” and you can hear how screwed up they are – and how, best of all from the POV of the elites, they think they are empowered and independent. “Sexual liberation” has always been a key tool for the elites.

Sorry, but I couldn’t let this slide twice in a row, I gave you a pass on you first post, not again. You are either truly delusional or a purposeful misinformation agent, in either case, you are simply wrong.
“Sexual liberation” AKA Feminism is and was a wholly jewish operated movement. Please stop with making this overly complex. Here to help…

                        While it’s undeniable that Jews were heavily involved in these movements, it is also undeniable that the WASPs, Rockefellers, Ford Foundation, etc. were fully on board with the agenda and arguably took the lead on it. The Rockefellers in particular were adamant that Catholics and blacks were having too many kids and they needed to find a way to stop that. Sexual liberation might have been the high point of the WASP-Jewish alliance.

                        First-wave feminism was HEAVILY packed with Jewish sisters. Gloria Steinem was only one of the most obvious examples.The Jews seem wired to make changes in the larger society that they don’t like. They band together through nepotism to accomplish this feat. The female branch of them concentrates on feminism, as, being women, that is as high as they can reach (the male branch concentrates on the world).Feminists lower the beauty of the world, it goes without saying. They make things ugly, and are ugly themselves. They have the reverse Midas touch, turning everything they encounter to shit. Women have more power today than they have ever had, and yet are more neurotic and unhappier than they have ever been. An amazing percentage of women is on mood-altering pills like Prozac or Zoloft, and the remainder is slutting around, looking for a man, hoping to trade pussy for a solid, lasting relationship (it never works).The ideal relationship is a woman on her knees, in more ways than one, before her man. If he wants a sandwich, she should just make him a damn sandwich. The only satisfying relationships I’ve ever had in my life have been ones where I was the dominant partner and the female did what I said. It’s clear that if you’re interested in happiness and not having fights with your significant other, there has to be an imbalance in power between the two of you. If a woman is dominant, she’ll nag the hell out of you and there’ll be no happiness. If the man is dominant, there is peace, tranquility, even a measure of joy in the household. There is no way around this, nor should there be.— Xloveli (www.dark.sport.blog)

                Thank you for this. I was about to tell Mycale that he misspelled J E W as C I A. I’m baffled by these complex conspiracies when Occam’s Razor fully applies here.
Greedy tribals absolutely –love– watching shiksas degrade themselves for money. This is merely the digital version of the 70s and onward massively Jew controlled porn industry.
They despise intact European families and modest daughters. Feminism is the other side of that coin also almost completely comprised of tribal agitators.

        FUD packing has its limits. Its the “clever hack” that does not solve the underlying problem: innate hostility towards Whites traveling down the road to “complete solutions” while being utterly dependent on Whites.I see in the various entertainment oriented Youtube channels: Mr. H., Valiant Renegade, WDW Pro, Culture Casino, Midnight’s Edge, and Critical Drinker (the big one) people saying that companies like Disney are anti-White and filled with hatred towards straight White men. They never would have said this even two years ago. I also see stuff in the comments that viewers will NOT see anything with a black dude or a chick in it, make her lame and gay.FUD packing is like Jim Fixx’s running program or the Karen Carpenter diet regime. It works until catastrophically, it doesn’t. FUD packing won’t substitute for a charismatic leader able to deliver results for the productive (read: White) portion of the country necessary for a re-industrialization, and military commitment around the globe. The worst thing to happen to the US were the easy victories over Saddam that inspired arrogance and complacency in the Feds, including the military.The fundamentals of human society in large industrial scale organization remain the same. All attempts at slave labor for large scale production have failed, over and over again: Austrian-origin flavor, Georgian-origin flavor, Han Chinese origin flavor. All flavors failed. Much like Flav himself. Only direct power-patronage of the Ike model actually works. A leader sets policy, delivers a high standard of living to his followers, who thus have direct incentives to fight for what is theirs.FUD packing/hacking does not address the fundamental failure of the system, which is why it is collapsing. Indeed, destroying Trump (he may well have made some “deal” with Ukraine funding) only opens the door to someone ostensibly like a certain other Man of Steel who was on the payroll and then decided to freelance for his own interests.

            Replying to my own comment, but want to add that the dynastic impulse among big shots trumps (pun intended) FUD packing.Right now you have an intifada on the Ivy Leagues, particularly Columbia. Aimed at the kids of powerful people who now fear for their own position and that of their family. Who have power, money, and the means to make things happen. Who have connections within the FUDs.At the same time, California is well on its way to establishing a Reparations tax on (straight White men only). There has been a committee and chair appointed to determine who is eligible for payments, size/scope and the tax to source payments yet to be determined. That’s a national issue. And given the prominence in the slave trade of certain people, they must be feeling the double heat. That verdict against Trump seizing his money sent shivers up the spines of those with a history of having that stuff aimed against them — and no amount of FUD packing that is able to disorient atomized, low family formation / extended family ordinary Whites will work against those with a more “clannish’ orientation.The good/bad side of the clannish people is that for them, it is always 1933. It will be for various reasons, always 1933. That means emerging threats cause the dynastic impulse to kick in very powerfully. FUD attempts don’t work there.

                We’re beyond propaganda, I think.
To persuade people you have to speak their language—literally. You have to make human mouth sounds and (seem to) think human thoughts. Our ruling and assistant ruling classes do neither of those things. The pronouncements of our politicians, corporate executives, generals, “experts,” “educators,” etc., all the way down to the war ads and girls’ diaries on the editorial page, are *incomprehensible*. They have no persuasive power—or purpose.
That *quality of their speech* is their final message to us: You are ruled.

        This is all well and good, and it wouldn’t surprise me if CIA FUD-packing and other shenanigans are a real thing. However, if we conclude that the CIA is a part of AINO’s power structure–which it undeniably is–and reason that Big Media is the Power Structure’s propaganda wing–which it certainly is–then FUD-packing and similar activities are almost otiose. When the CIA and Big Media are a binary system, FUD-packing may be minor league activity for greenhorn spooks and drudges trying to make it to the majors.

        “…our information space is a FUD-packers ball where nothing should be taken at face value.”Seems like a feature created to cause distrust in the general population.  I used to think—at the beginning—that the Internet would/must be suppressed/censored because of the ability of it to spread alternative information and viewpoints, but then I rejoiced because I also knew such suppression would be impossible given the nature of the technology.As usual in these matters, I see that I was wrong. Z-man’s missive today points out another way to undermine/suppress the internet, malinformation.  In short, create enough noise to signal and the signal (truth) disappears.  Even better, create mistrust of all truth tellers and the masses have no one to group around and therefore organize against our tormentors.  We can see this writ large in some of the commentary below.Some suggest that we need to improve our “spidey sense” and become better consumers of Internet information, but I’m not certain how.  Others suggest not believing anything you read and hear, but only what you can verify.Once societal trust breaks down, it seems organized large scale movement for change becomes impossible.  What remains is unorganized, sporatic, chaotic violence-and that is easily “taken care of” by our elites.

            “Some suggest that we need to improve our “spidey sense” and become better consumers of Internet information, but I’m not certain how…”—————————-Most of us don’t understand how propaganda works. Fortunately our current noble class doesn’t either – they just spam us with lies and shite and hope some of it sticks. You guys here are proof that you just can’t take a dump, tell someone it’s ice cream and expect him to eat it. Lies on their own, by themselves… are more often liabilities than anything else and are easily debunked for the most part.The REAL trick to propaganda is to make people WANT to believe it. Once they want to believe something, truth and falsehoods have nothing to do with anything. Some propaganda is so deftly subtle that it borders on works of art. The tapestry of lies and perfidy in the jewish narrative, from the holocaust in Nazi Germany to the one going on right now in the Gaza leaves one breathless. I am not sure I understand it myself? The obvious truth and lies are everywhere: you see the awful vids where the Russians are stacking dead Ukes like cord wood, or blowing up tanks, or capturing pregnant Uke ‘soldiers’ …. it’s all there… and yet the idiot politicos are gleefully waving Ukranian flags after flushing another 61 billion dollars down that hell hole and proclaiming a victory any day now.I submit that the stuff we are seeing is an intentional rejection of reality by weak and hateful people who want to replace it with warm fuzzy narratives starring themselves as the heroes in their own little life’s manuscript.I don’t think we have to become oracles with magic crystal balls or bitter skeptics with lie detectors. I think the way forward is to just become critical thinkers.My pro – tip of the day is this: if you hear somebody emoting over an issue… and trying to get you to emote as well… that is when your guard must be up.

                    100% top reply, thiscannotbe overstated. The amount of –really– fucking dumb people is growing exponentially. This number is growing like a snowball rolling downhill with Tiktok, Social Media, Ghettoization of culture, and total lack of education acting as a crushing downward force on intellect.IQs are dropping precipitously and you are accurate in your assessment that in relation to the size of the armed forces we are basically spec-ops.Normies are dim, and the left which comprises a scarily large percentage of the population has bought this propaganda wholly. I have friends highly intelligent / educated, midwits, and the rather dull and across all 3 categories the number of ‘True Believers’ is starting to get a bit scary.These are people who will gladly take a sucker punch to the head or offer up their daughter because… reasons. They are also really starting to come around on the ‘men are women if they say they are’ issue too. There is no reasoning with these people hence why I have minimized my interaction massively at this point.

Not only does a dismally large percentage fail to realize the turd that they are licking, they force you to lick it too.

                I can’t find the exact quote, but from Nietzsche (of course!) writing about how a priest/mystic gains power over his followers: It is not necessary that a claim be true, only that the follower believe it to be true.

        The CIA has long acted like a shadow government. They seem to believe in Langley that they have a mandate to make policy as well as execute it. Both the US and the USSR had leaders who came from the Intel ranks. And Putin is of course ex-KGB.What does serving in the intelligence agencies teach one? It’s like being a cop — you see the worst of humanity, and it has to taint your worldview.It begs the question what would the Intel boys stop at doing? Likely, nothing is off the table. Only their fear of getting caught and punished would slow them down. If they were FUD-packing, would it worry them to be exposed? I doubt it.If the CIA acts as a de facto shadow government, it could well use Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt to be a kingmaker, but it would be more likely to use its ties in the regular media.The NSA works hand-in-glove with the tech megacorps and the CIA might let it handle that while the CIA liases with media. Homeland Security, as the umbrella structure for all the Intel groups, could fund the social influencers and let the CIA experts manage them. But I think in the end it’s a question of where they’re going to get the most bang for their influencing buck: with tiny-sized influencers or with massive scale audio-visual media. Chances are, if the CIA is meddling, they’re doing so thru the straight legacy media.— Xloveli (www.dark.sport.blog)

        As far as the congressional intelligence committees, they select for stupidity. Case in point: Senator Richard Burr, Republican from North Carolina and key player in the Russia collusion hoax. Burr’s primary past employment was selling lawn mowers, not that there’s anything wrong with it per se, but it is plain he was in over his head peddling them. Case in point: Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, who likely is mentally retarded. Case in point: Democrat Adam Schiff of California, who likely is mentally ill. On and on.They put morons on these committees, take them into Super Sekret spy dens, and convince them the Jamaicans are on the verge of world dominance and using weed to control the young and, worse of all, not giving the Help and Ho’s a cut of the profits. As far as the wide open border with aliens and terrorists streaming across? No problem.Somewhat related, a story recently emerged and was quickly memoryholed that indicated CIA staff and officers took outright bribes. I don’t know whether it was false or true, but given the rampant corruption coursing through this dying empire’s veins, it is probable. Any doubt senators and congressmen would not share in the grift?As for Tracey himself–maybe. The intelligence services also use cut-outs to approach media people to feed them information that helps them keep their current con going. Tracey could be paid–the lack of known income makes that not unlikely–or he simply may be a parrot. When you look at Operation Mockingbird closely enough, it also relied on gullibility and pliability.The National Security Apparatus has been in full control for some time, and people did not care when it was effective. Now it has become just as corrupt and stupid as everything else, and even if people care they can do nothing about it.

        I keep getting unsolicited emails from Michael Tracey to join his substack. I had only vaguely been aware of him before that and before this accusation against Trump. It wouldn’t surprise me if he is being or has been coopted as a Fed asset. But I don’t know about Trump either. The era of good governance is dead. I sure didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020 because I thought he would be a good steward of the public trust. People who trust the “trusted sources” are living in a carnival funhouse. That’s most people. For instance, my wife continues to confuse the Russians with the Soviet Union and there is nothing I can tell her to disabuse her of this notion. Not that the Russians are the “good guys” either. They are playing Big Power politics, duh. Just apply a little common sense, disengage, and try to maintain your sanity.

        While it’s a common theme here (or should be), today’s essay only hints at the problem: The intelligence agencies and/or other shadowy groups — call it the Deep State or whatever you like — is the real power behind the throne. Our entire system of government is mostly theater. The real powers that be are, in all likelihood and for all practical purposes unaccountable to anyone and above the law. Of course it’s hard to get “proof” of such salacious allegations, but neither can they completely hide their activities. On an ongoing basis, one of the most telling hints is simply how our elected officials so often and seemingly inexplicably change their voting or administrative behavior shortly after they arrive at the center of power. Perhaps they’ve simply adapted to Washington’s realities and nobody takes campaign promises seriously anyway. Yet a less charitable interpretation of events is that most of the people who supposedly are in power are beholden to hidden powers. One can only assume that various techniques of bribery, blackmail, extortion etc. are held over their heads like the Sword of Damocles. Even that rare man who doesn’t have some skeletons in his closet cannot be immune to various threats against his property or people he cares about.Perhaps all this reads like something out of a bad spy novel or espionage thriller, but I think this is a realistic view of our government and perhaps most governments in general.The only positive thing I can say, and it’s only a slight blessing: the Deep State, the Inner Party, probably is far from monolithic. There is no honor among thieves, and the men at the top have no principles worthy of the name. It’s simply animal nature to be predatory, to strike when an opponent is perceived to be weak, to expand one’s power and territory whenever possible. The only thing that maintains some semblance elf a balance of power is what might be termed an uneasy truce among two or more factions of roughly equal power and influence.The best we small guys can do is try and stay out of their way.

            It’s actually worse because we know who these people are, at least in principle. We know their names and at least a nominal position they hold.  For example, Flynn designed a kidnapping and murder plot for Julian Assange.  We are simply powerless to do anything about them.Though I don’t usually use the term, this is what I understand the term “deep state” means.  These are the people who classify a billion documents. They are the unelected and unaccountable people in the various bureaucracies and intelligence agencies. They are not so much above the law as they are outside of the law. When everything you do can be labeled “top secret eyes only” there is little that can be done.

                It may be something like a law of political science that democracy will *always* be a facade with the real power being elsewhere. The reason is that some man or group of men must ultimately be in charge and their position cannot really be subject to elections every few years. Part of being in charge is being in charge permanently so that you can see projects from concept to completion.Some faction within the government or civil society will become the de facto ruling hunta. Will it be the postal workers? environmental enforcement agents? corporate executives? air traffic controllers? All of them might be semi-permanent but do any of them have the killer instinct and willingness (and “license to kill”) to use it? No, so that leaves basically the military and the intelligence agencies. Since the US isn’t (yet) Latin America we didn’t get a committee of generals running things but a bunch creepy geeks who live in basements around Langley, VA.

Although, in a way, deep fakes are a double-edged sword.  Too frequent and outlandish use of them destroys their credibility neutralizing their effectiveness (not that it would matter in court of lawfare anyway).

            The Intelligence agencies comprise the new Praetorian Guard, and obviously think they can overthrow any elected official with real or planted blackmail activity…If not, there is always a hand plane crash that can be engineered….

                The failed coup attempt against Trump was spectacular. Angleton and the Boys would not have come up short. Like everything else now, the National Security State has a crisis of competency, and its directors and employees are far more stupid than in the past and marinated in the self-destructive Woke ideology.
There also is the question of Praetorian Guard for whom. It seems to shift, possibly on the basis of high bidder.

                    I’m gonna say they would have pursued an entirely different strategy. Most successful “deep state” hoaxes start by taking some true thing and then twisting it into something else, turning that true thing into something that it is not. So it’s harder to disprove, since it started with a true thing. The flaw in the Russia hoax was that it was based on vapor from the beginning.

            “… one of the most telling hints is simply how our elected officials so often and seemingly inexplicably change their voting or administrative behavior shortly after they arrive at the center of power.”Assuming what I heard decades ago was true, this suspicion is not off the mark.  Case in point, the FBI when J Edgar was in charge.  Hoover died in office—well past mandatory retirement age for Government service—having been exempted repeatedly by Congress and with no President daring to fire him.  Why?It is said that Hoover met with each politician upon election—ostensibly a “meet and greet” get acquainted “chat”.  During this chat, Hoover would reveal the politician’s “unverified” FBI dossier.  This included every slur and accusation ever recorded for that politician.  Hoover would of course play down such unverified accusations and assure that as long as he was in charge, such would never reach the light of day.Now this subtle blackmail has been denied—even by Wikipedia, however how does this “rumor” gel with what happened to Trump upon assuming office?  Trump met with Comey, then current Director, and at that meeting was shown the infamous “Russian Dossier”.  The one made up by the Clinton campaign and allegedly discovered by McCain and turned over to the FBI (McCain being the “patriot” we all know him to be).  Quite a co-incidence.Anyway, the story is that Trump was advised to fire Comey immediately, but hesitated until finally forced to by Comey’s anti-administration actions in office.  By then of course, the dossier was all over the place and the full court press to remove/discredit Trump was in full swing.My take has always been that Trump was the first—and most important—political figure that could *not* be blackmailed by the Deep State and from there all Trump’s misfortunes stem—and still do today.  In that belief, I support him whole heartedly—as a disrupter, if nothing else.

                        Not a problem.  The point of my comment was that the Deep State has blackmailed pol’s for years in one manner or another—or worse, gotten rid of them.  Those not formally “in the bag” are converted rather quickly upon arrival in DC.
We (the masses) often hear of this, but are told it’s the “big money” and “corporate” donors who hold the sway and power.  I’m not so sure any more.

                        A black budget is also a dark pool.If the circular money laundry of foreign aid works, so do black budgets supplemented by criminal networks (drugs, trafficking, weapons,).
Hillary, oddly, had immunity to operate globally like Hunter Biden did.  The same pair famous for Mena shipments and dead witnesses created the Global Initiative and, oddly, took the limit caps off of black budgets.

            Even if there were ever such a thing as a squeaky clean politician wet behind the ears and new to the Imperial Capital, it’s a not even trivial matter for the security state to insert some demonstration “skeletons” into his laptop and give him a gentle heads up on how he ought to conceive of his place in the pecking order.

        I’m very aware, and have posted before, that “dissident” media is no doubt infiltrated and controlled to some degree by globohomo. After completely capturing and controlling the “mainstream” media it’s not as if they would just ignore the “dissident” part, especially since it has grown post 2016. And so I take note of things that seem to “suddenly” trend on dissident media in that context.I am no more perfect at sussing out controlled op and fakery than anyone else is. So one of the tools I employ is noting who uses racial slurs, and/or tolerates them in the comment section. Even without the “slurs,” who jew bashes? Negro bashes? Homo bashes? etc. And who comes down hard on “racists” and “racism” and “homophobia?” These are great indicators of who is not globohomo controlled vs who is suspect. If the CIA shills ever cross that line then my ability (such as it is) to identify what is real and what is astroturfed will be severely handicapped. But I don’t think they can bring themselves to. And for now at least, they don’t need to.With recent new legislative passages which further enable “him” to do so, I wont be surprised if the “president” more or less shuts down dissident internet media a month or so prior to the “election.” Citing “disinformation” of course. It will cause a hue and cry, but the election will be over by the time things can get sorted out.

                    Sharp observation. I cannot recall where I read or heard it the other day, but someone commented that one of the worst problems with current FBI corruption is that the older agents who at least knew it was wrong are retiring and going away, and the young crop coming up believe that is the correct way to behave.
The stupid zeitgeist flows both ways.

                        I agree but that’s a little more specific. What I was talking about here was general regime astroturfing that’s done on a daily or weekly basis. Moreover, anyone who did cross that line in that way, regularly and publicly, would pretty much ruin all their future prospects with the regime. Even if they were doing it on the regime’s behalf.

                        Possibly, I guess. My sneaking suspicion is that like lawfare as it exists, that would only apply to apostates, agents who someday regret what they have done. So long as you stay loyal, your career path is secure. Snowden would probably be the golden haired boy if he were a contractor for RNC rather than NSA.
It’s why gang initiation rites often require commission of a serious crime. To ensure you never have second thoughts.

            This is a good start, but anybody who has spent any time on sites like Gab or 4chan can assure you the approach is not enough. Agents (particularly those employed by our Greatest Ally) are quite capable about displaying supposed racism up to and including racial slurs.However, what all of them are utterly incapable of doing is holding CONSISTENT racial/ethnic views. For instance, somebody who drops the N-word constantly, promotes tons of stories about black disfunction, but proudly Stands With Israel? Or conversely somebody who blames every problem in the world on “da Joooos!” in a comically simplistic way is obviously just acting and should likewise not be trusted in any way.

                I agree that can help, though it’s one you need to be a little careful with. Pop over to Taylor’s site. You see all kinds of people who have personally experienced the darker side of urban dysfunction. If that’s your only first-hand experience with diversity, why would any intelligent person generalize to white/not white instead of black/not black?

                    The Finkels are serious troublemakers, no doubt about it. However, there’s plenty of blame to go around. The Puritans and the nuggras, albeit in very different ways, are also deeply complicit in the destruction of the West.

                        And, yet, as I look around at the problems in my own community, almost everything can be traced back to the actions of soy boys and karens.

                    The prevalence of Martinsburg strip clubs has two reasons. First, Virginia doesn’t allow full nudity in their strip clubs so people who enjoy that form of entertainment pop across the border for the full monty.Second, rich white, Jewish, Indian and Asian girls in NoVa aren’t the best pool for recruiting dancers whereas WV is the perfect hunting ground.The housing scene around Martinsburg and, really, any of those towns/cities along the mountains is always strange. You can have some very nice houses across the street from a shack. Here in Loudoun County, we drive out the poor before building a country estate.

                As to Marko’s comment regarding Z-man, I think there is merit here.
Have we not seen over the years a productive ability with regard to writing and podcasts equivalent to *more* than one man?
Does not Z-man’s the level of understanding and insight and opinion on a variety events surpass that of a *single* individual?
Did not Z-man recently move into a remote country “Dacha” from a slum ridden apartment in Swaziland?  Does this not indicate some unexplained wealth?
No, I think Marlo has outed Z-man as a tool of the Deep State.
You have been warned….

            Some of us have witnessed oddities that are inexplicable according to Newtonian physics. I and ten other engineers watched a tetrahedron the size of a small town cruising at 1k agl without any discernible means of propulsion or other features. NFW it was or ever will be constructed by human beings within our lifetimes.

                    There is a butt-ton of evidence of “something”, but I can’t use it, so I refuse to have an opinion.
Since all data is accumulated anecdotes, DaBears’ anecdote means a heck of a lot, for sure.  There is still wonder and mystery in the world.

                Did any of you contact local ATC or NOAA for radar data gathered at the time of the event?I’m guessing that the tetrahedron was a projected hologram. It would need no propulsion, and the horrid aerodynamics would be irrelevant. Changing the size of the hologram would give the illusion of a constant volume object moving toward or away from intended viewers. I can only assume that you and the other engineers were gathered in one spot, not separated into subsets located thousands of feet apart on opposite sides of the position, or apparent postion, on the ground beneath the tetrahedron. So the 11 of you would not have noticed any inconsistencies between different vantage points.

                        Never heard of “Project Bluebeam” before. The NASA angle suggests that there’s some flattardism or Apollo-denial involved as a motive for the hypothesis. It’s nice, tho, to see that you can reply to one of my comments without throwing another temper tantrum. There may be reason to hope for you after all.Fyi, a deposit of anecdotes is like having almost no data at all when you have no good reason for believing in the class of alleged phenonemon to which the anecdotes belong. Anecdotes about alleged alien spacecraft are not like anecdotes about shifty lawyers, cheating housewives, and Jews trading enslaved Europeans to Turks and Moors.So here we have a case in which the science nerds are correct. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, or at least a much better UFO story. For reasons which I won’t get into here, a tetrahedron is a horrid shape for high speed interstellar travel.

            Tucker’s “UFO” interest is his way of telling intelligent people that he’s not on the level. It’s a wink. There is absolutely no chance he believes it. None.
It’s a shame; his 2020 monologues during the worst of the Floyd riots (one night he went for 28 straight minutes without interruption) were the most articulate expression of our rage since Buchanan. But I fear it’s just an act, which is what I sized him up as back in his bow-tied smarmy prep school days.

                Like old Alex Jones rants, “lunatic” camoflague makes him harmless, not a threat to the system.  Lawfare and half billion-dollar judgements tend to pack a serious wollop.
I do disagree with the “compromised” label, and I trust what Tuck’s telling us.  Yes he’s a moderate Episcopalian, but I don’t hear anyone else openly and frequently advocating for white interests.  He actually says the dreaded W-word quite a lot.

        I’ve noticed that Tracy seems mostly to appeal to Gen Xers and millennials who consider themselves Republican/conservative now, but never went along with the pro-life/no homosexual unions/marriage cultural war of the 1990s. He’s just a moderate 1990s lefty who finds some of the “woke” things around him ridiculous, but has no real answer to any of them except to complain. He’s useless.He documented the 2020 riots quite well, traveled around taking photographs and interviewing, but I don’t recall him suggesting anything concrete as an answer except “look at this, it’s terrible, these rioters are terrible and ordinary people pay the price, life sucks.” Definitely FUD.

        This is yet another reason why trying to have an opinion as a midwit feels pointless. The common wisdom is that history is a nonfactual fairytale, our perceptions are biased beyond use, and memory is so faulty it ought not to be allowed as evidence in court. Then you add in all these other reasons to disbelieve what you see and hear with your own eyes and ears on a daily basis. I know Zman has said the mark of a stupid person is not being able to tell who to trust, but it seems like everything comes with an asterisk behind it.

            We live in a time when both the supply of and the demand for truth are at a low ebb. This will inevitably change as society continues to fall apart, but the demand for truth will rise much more sharply than the supply. In those periods, ontology, epistemology, and error-avoidance will be sought after skills.

                “In those periods, ontology, epistemology, and error-avoidance will be sought after skills.”
Or perhaps the most sought after skills in such times will be merciless brutality.
Sure, I hope that when things fall apart the chicks will finally appreciate my philosophical studliness 🙂  “You have such a huge ontology,” she purred.

            I have no idea whom to trust anymore, because the psychological and social development of people under 30 is so unlike anything I experienced growing up that I can’t read their expressions or behavior. I suppose that marks me as stupid.These are people raised on mimicry, of watching tens of thousands of visual images to imitate the behaviors of others. How much of their own behavior is genuine, or automatic? I can’t possibly know what they’re thinking, and it’s impossible most of the time to determine the intentions behind, say, cooperative behavior at work. We assume good intentions. But we can’t know.My grandfather told me never to underestimate anyone. You simply cannot know what anyone is capable of, and the moment you think you do, you’re made a very risky bet.

            Your comment reminds me of some questions that present themselves to me in my more humble moments:If you know that there are people significantly smarter than you, who can benefit by tricking you, how do you decide whom to trust?If you know that the complexity of the world exceeds your cognitive capacity, how do you decide what to believe?  How can you have any confidence in your conclusions about how the world works?I’m asking for a friend, of course 🙂A good analogy for this quandary is the Hobbits in the Lord of the Rings.  They were physically weak and had no ability in sorcery.  What advice would you give to a Hobbit who was trying to understand his world and “do the right thing?”I guess the reason that the Lord of the Rings is inspiring is that the fundamental reality of that world is religious and an impotent Hobbit can still perceive this religious truth, in spite of his vast limitations.And Tolkien’s inspiring conclusion is that a few lowly Hobbits with stout hearts saved the world.  As much as I love that message, it doesn’t seem to apply to our world.  But again, I could be wrong, due to my limitations.

Maybe They had a crapton of help. What I always found the most inspiring was that in what was little more than a Tolkien afterthought, a few Hobbits singlehandedly saved the Shire.

                    Steve, can we be guided by what guided the Hobbits?
The Hobbits were like rabbits in the woods, almost the very definition of “prey.”  They were unremarkable with respect to their intellectual ability or capacity for violence.
Yet they had access to a religious truth that guided them to victory for their people.
Do those of us, in this world, who are not geniuses of mind or violence, have access to an equivalent truth to guide us?

                        Sam: It’s all wrong By rights we shouldn’t even be here. But we are. It’s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn’t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t. Because they were holding on to something.Frodo: What are we holding on to, Sam?Sam :That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.Axiomatic Truth Ultra White Pill Dropper Sam Gamgee telling it like it is.

He also somehow got a book not only published, but *reviewed* by NY Times contributor types, though I must admit I don’t understand that whole biz too well.

            My guess is that Tracey is like most of 40+ years old white Democrats that I know.The Democrat party that they signed up for in the last century was about economically protecting the little guy from rapacious corporations.Today, I see so many bewildered older Democrats who wonder when that old mission was replaced by “overthrow Whitey.”  Like Tracey.But I have no sympathy for them.  They are absolute willing zombies under the command of the elite media.  They would rather support the “overthrow Whitey” Democrats than the evil racist fascist populists.  They have almost no ability to think for themselves.FVck them.  They absolutely deserve it for their stupidity.  No mercy for them.  And this includes some of my friends.

        Please allow me to add two more names to the pool of usual suspects.Pepe Escobar has a new canard circulating that the Israelis flew an F-35 with an EMP nuke toward Iran and the Russians shot it down. WTF!My good friend Dan Bongino is now selling the whopper that the Israelis are the real victims in the ongoing slaughter of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.Yes, cyber warfare is a real thing, and it works quite well on the stupid fraction of the population. It’s also known as Reddit warfare these days, and its not working so well in Ukraine. A lotta stupid dupes are dying at the front and eliminating their genes from the gene pool. Another win for Putin.
