        @ 47:00 minute mark, I know Don McCrae. He’s not just a goodwhite. He’s the worst kind: he’s a South African goodwhite. He’s a good writer (“Dark Trade” is probably the best book about boxing you’ll ever read), but he’s like a New England liberal times an Ontarian progressive multiplied by a German feminist working at the Holocaust Museum when it comes to race. Negroes railing about being “forty-million dollar slaves” and taking knees for the Anthem, etc. should be encouraged in their lament, since even lame-stream republicans and moderate whites get turned off by this crap. Pop culture is one of the few routes blacks have to achieve power and money (aside from political corruption). Let them self-immolate through whining.

        Do you think peaceful separation is possible in this day and age, Z?Consider that it takes a force of will – even for an intelligent member of the Dissident Right – to ignore the storm of provacative shite that swirls through the internet and social media. On any given day, I will read at least three things that make me want to go down to the NYT, bar the doors so that none of the media slobs can get out – and set the building on fire. Guys like me have the maturity and intellect to restrain ourselves and curb our impulses.Does Abu-Al-Fuknuk-Al? Or Tyrone Dindu? I agree there has to be some seperation, but it will have to be enforced with violence. I can’t see any other means working.

            The possible roads from here are:
1) The endless invasion makes America into something like Brazil.2) The White population revolts and we get a very right-wing revolution.3) We get a combination of the two, with political terrorism by disaffected whites.
Our ruling class has been preparing for Option #3 for decades now.

                My hope is that the current situation, and the potential for a “bandwagon” effect of jumping to the winning team, would allow for a vast proportion of the lost middle to get red-pilled and get on with supporting what is good and right.  Unfortunately, bandwagons do not necessarily create strong bonds or lasting associations.  But I will take what I can get.  The alternative scenarios are not good.
We do have the advantage, in that much of the opposition to our perspective acts out in batshit-crazy fashion.  If batshit-crazy stops getting normalized, we are halfway home.

                When I was Bankstering I spent a fair amount of time in Rio, Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte .The degree of separation that the elites maintained between themselves and the occupants of the favellas was astonishing, All achieved by a brutal police force.It’s coming to a city near you.

            What exactly happens in the future isn’t clear, but I do know one thing:  Once you learn the truth about race and genetics, there’s no going back to believing nonsense like “diversity is our strength or all people are the same.” That makes some type of separation inevitable.  Hopefully it’s a peaceful split.

        Peaceful separation is already with us.  It’s called money and lots of it.
That’s why the elite get to virtue signal about how wonderful diversity is.  Their never subjected to it.
Once they finally strip away our culture and religion transforming us into one giant mud race ruling over us will become that much easier.
Another great podcast . thank you Z

Their prices discriminate so they don’t have to.

        Last week, I appealed to the Zblog “commentariat” re: my “husband’s” painful “hegemonic masculinity.”  An astute commenter suggested that I pivot to reifying my “husband’s” conceptualization of the intricacies of the “female” body through radically transformative practices of aggressive “seduction”, implying that this might involve some “dirty deeds.”  I took said advice, yet my attempts at the exploration of my “husband’s” cisnormative structure were met with a demarcating of boundaries (I was unable to unmask a rigor for/us: and catch his ineffability).  This turn of events is very concerning, perhaps even problematic.  I have not yet tried breathing through my “vagina”, which at least would introduce a novel quality of “unexpectedness”, possibly “terror.” I am afraid xis male gaze may not be ready for that and that I have been steered in the wrong direction.  I had best stop listening to the podcast and reading the comments.They are clearly a bad influence.

            I am sorry my suggestions did not help.  I am a simple person with simple desires and preferences.  You are no doubt in need of input from people with a more sophisticated understanding of such things.From what I hear about the male gaze (entirely from close friends, of course, having no firsthand experience in such things), the partially clothed but provocative is much more powerful than the naked.  In this spirit, simultaneously offer him a Penthouse magazine, a Playboy, a Victoria’s Secret catalog, a Sears catalog, and a National Geographic.  See which one he picks up first.  If it is the NG, I have absolutely no idea what you are going to do.  Any of the others should give you some perspective.  Good luck!

        First post! And there’s still no link to the pod in the blogroll.I mean to this:http://thezman.com/wordpress/?cat=38
And btw, you may like:Opusfeed, a cross-platform software for automatically generating a low-quality opus rss feed from another (audio or video) rss feed.
Here’s how that looks in practice:No Agenda Lite
No Agenda is of course the best podcast in the universe!

        Really good. The judicious use of bluntness is very effective.

        Excellent, podcast flows easily, I have it running in the office, and I retain most of the meaning,  even when doing something else as well.
