        Back in the mid-Pliocene, when I was in the writing biz, it was Chicago Manual of Style plus occasionally Strunk and White.
‘Creative writers can use AI to enhance their creativity’
I doubt that.  AI will have a dumbing-down and levelling effect.

            When I was in college, the style manual was Turabian.
As for AI and the writing process, it strikes me as a crutch. Not that I can really blame a bloke who cranks out 350 articles per year for using it if it saves labor appreciably. OTOH, a truly confident writer shouldn’t need a bot to tell him what’s what.

            I took Rhetoric for two semesters at UChicago. Five drafts of every essay for the first semester. Two pages at age 18, returned in red, every line re-written and mocked by the instructor to reduce me to tears.I read the essays from Grok and other AI models. I wish my rhetoric professor were still alive to grade them. The essays churned out by Grok are written in casual 2010-2015 undergraduate level. To people who spend their lives in books written prior to 2000, they already have an odor of idiocy to them, as befits the epoch in which they were created.

“Professor” is singular yet “were” in this context is plural.

                        I wouldn’t claim it’s good. But it was intended to be humorous in a sense that Mr. Metcalf could appreciate and laugh at. (Indicative versus subjunctive.)
Or at least the Maroon reference, which Mr. Metcalf would clearly understand since he is one of them. (U. Chicago community members call themselves “Maroons” after the official school color.)
U. Chicago, undergrad, is “where fun goes to die,” as they say. True here, but I believe SSRI withdrawal deserves most of the credit.

            To predict the effects of a technology in current_year, you have to think like a shitty boss, not a consumer or producer. The latter get no consideration. What would the worstmanagerdo? Use “AI” as “metrics”—as judgment.
That means punishing writer-employees for being un-average, for wasting processor time changing everything they write, generating hierarchical friction by thinking they’re decision-makers, etc.
Words don’t work that way, said the illiterate robot, in the voice of perfect authority.

            The internet has had a dumbing down effect on me. Because I spend so much time talking into a device, I get a little confused about where commas go these days and when you overdo it. There’s something about actually typing it yourself that focuses the mind. I’m also not fond of the changes autocorrect imposes on you. I will see something that looks good while I am speaking it out, next thing you know I posted and it’s garbled.
I don’t know if this has anything to do with what the article is about, but call me skeptical.

When you read a book published 100 or even 200 hundred years ago the sentences will be long and  will havebigger vocabulary . Gibbons for example is much more sophisticated then any modern  writer.  The old  letter writers could give  an AI a good run for its bitcoin

                Sure.  Read some 19th century American fiction.  Try some Henry James on for style.  Even the short stories.
His prose would drive a modern kid to suicide.

        The world will never be free of cranks.I like this post mainly because you’re getting closer to the reality that AI is not a “singular”.  AI is many robots created and fed data by many people speaking many different languages each with their own cultural distinctiveness.Like the pagan gods, people will worship Apollo AI or Athena AI or Buddha AI in their search for truth and meaning.  But like the pagan gods of old, only misery and disappointment will they find.Writing is the visualization of language with all its subtleties.  The various AI can mimic, based on what information we feed it, but it can never solve it.We might all seem to get a little smarter.Just like everyone else.

            What we call AI is nothing but a cheat, a massive data grab. Anchored in reality butapart fromreality at the same time, the AI looks at the world as if it were a puzzle to be cracked. But the world is not a puzzle, it is the world, and only a fool believes in AI’s creativity.

            The big question here is whether ackshual flesh-n-blood human beings will be satisfied with consuming A.I. output, or whether a significant portion of theflesh-n-blood human population will revolt, and demand ackshual flesh-n-blood authenticity?My guess is that Vilfredo Pareto’s name will once again pop up in the near future; likely 80% of all humans will be satisfied with A.I. literature &amp;A.I.music &amp;A.I.theater, versus 20% of humans being repulsed by it.Along those lines, I have long thought that any &amp; all electric &amp; electronic music will soon becomedéclasséefor the 20%; that soon there will be a renaissance of acoustic guitar,acousticbanjo,acousticharmonica,acousticwoodwinds,acousticstringed instruments,acousticbrasswinds etc etc etc.&lt;spanOnline j00t00b vidya of A.I. generated music will be considered obscene, andfor the Haute Couture set,underground samizdat Speak-Easy analogue/acoustic music venues will be where the action is at.Authenticity will become the rallying cry of the 20%.Goodness only knows what the A.I. will decide to do with the 80%.Probably something along the lines of Soylent Green.Or Logan’s Run.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M2vx_RCwSs

                YouTube has an increasing amount on AI generated content. At this point, it is just the audio. The video is a slide show of images that were probably created by AI. There is something unappealing about it. The audio does sound nature, but there remains the uncanny valley quality to it. Even highly trained voice actors have slight flaws and ticks. AI lacks it.

                    Rick Beato has been all over the A.I. music nightmare for several years now:https://www.bing.com/search?q=Rick+Beato+A.I.+musicBeato is deeply pessimistic about this topic, and lately he’s been especially worried about the extent to which the A.I. models are simply “sampling” the chords &amp; harmonies &amp; counterpoint of classic Rock &amp; classic Disco &amp; classic Country [et cetera], then effectively regurgitating it with a slicker &amp; shinier album cover, whilst never giving the original human creators any rights to the “sampled” content which the  A.I. effectively stole from the original human creators.BTW, there are “grammatical” cues in traditional music symbolism which are entirely analogous to the grammar of human language.Musical notation such as:.for staccato_for legato/tenuto‘to take a breath&gt;to decrease volume&lt;to increase volume^for give it all you’ve got.And if you start messing around with the grammar of the musical score, then very quickly the score will degenerate into a-musical gibberish.

                        The difference that will be easy to spot is in those cues you list.  But also, the more intelligent the listener, the harder it is for AI to simply rehash manipulative chords and phrases.At some point, you have to have something to say.  80% of people are fine with “feelies”, but 20% will struggle with AI because AI can only mimic like a cover band.  Or those B and C movies that steal a concept from a great movie to try and capitalize on the success of others.Buckcherry vs The Black Crowes for example.  Bush and Creed vs Nirvana or Pearl Jam.  Mimicry only gets you so far.

                    The worst thing is, the YouTube algo knows my interests and feeds me AI slop, which has apparently been generated by Indians whose sole job is to create AI slop for any possible interest. I can kinda tell by the thumbnail if it’s AI or not, but not always. But the minute I see the images and hear the robot voice, I know. And I hate that I gave that stupid creator a view metric.

                    I’ve noticed something similar with advertising. You take an ad that was handset with type back in the 1970s or 1980s and compare it with something computer-generated today. The stuff today has a lack of personality. It’s just too perfect. Too corporate looking.

                        My mom did page layout for the local weekly newspaper for decades. Little pieces of plastic and tape. Then she’d shoot a negative, the negative would be burned on a plate, the plate went to the press room in the basement of the building. They didn’t go digital until the 00’s iirc. A mind boggling amount of labor went into something that cost, basically, pocket change.
The paper now occupies a small office in the next town, employs a handful of people, is printed who-knows-where, and nobody reads it. Incredible.

                            In the Eighties I did hand layouts for the agency’s newsletter and annual reports.  It’s like putting a puzzle together, without the ‘edges’.
As the Nineties neared, the layouts went computer generated.  Had that been the totality of my job, I’d have been dumped.

                    It’s like the rubber skin terminators described in the movie.  “Easy to spot”.  It’ll improve and evolve.  Fakier products will get fewer views than language programs that seem more real.  Over time, the language programs will evolve.  The funny thing is that there will be a bias in American AI for foreign, particularly UK, accents which carry a strange sense of authority.
And at some point AI will be told to be more “culturally sensitive” (less white) and we’ll be told to “axe” Alexa a question instead of ask.

                It’s going to be “Brave New World”.  All the pieces are in place.Feelies (Hallmark movies)Soma (marijuana)Birthing pods (human genetic engineering, surrogate mothers)low IQ labor castes (immigration, field now)I’m one of those people who they probably decide to exile to an island.  Which is described as a very great place for people who aren’t in the 80%.The thing that’s coming with AI and automation, a process that’s already well underway, is a massive die-off of the human population.  Mostly fertility drive, maybe a big war or bioengineered pandemic.To your point about art, though, I agree.  There’s a weird falseness to AI “creative” products which are really just fancy mimicry.  The 80% will be fine with this as the fake AI stuff gives the appearance of wealth and good taste.  The 20% – where the wealth and intelligence and industriousness resides – will seek out human created art.

        Personally, I welcome AI-generated text, because you people will now get to experience the professor’s joy. Back in the days, students slapped their “essays” together with whatever random phrases they had in their notes, from the one or two days they bothered to attend class. Those were easy to spot, because of all the typos and terrible grammar. Now, with AI, it’s still randomly slapped-together crap, but with zero typos and acceptable grammar, so you actually have to read the damn thing to realize it’s all gibberish. It’s like being low-grade stoned all the time, and now y’all can feel it too.

Asking a modern student to read a book and then write an essay on it is just asking Grok to summarize the book and then asking it to write an essay on one aspect of it. There will be little chance for the teachers/grad students doing the grading to catch it.

                I have to disagree a bit — there are AI tools to catch AI, like Turnitin. Most of the places I’ve taught required online essay submissions, which go through Turnitin automatically. It’s pretty good, but even if you don’t have Turnitin, you can spot an AI essay because of its superficial lucidity (wasn’t that a Queensryche tune?). But I agree that in the end it won’t matter — thanks largely to Zoom school, most students literally couldn’t write an essay these days without AI, so there will soon be no essays, and the world gets one step closer toIdiocracy.

                    Is superficial lucidity proof of reliance upon AI? Probably wouldn’t hold up in an academic star chamber where young Sha’Quees’ha claims her prof be rayciss for doubting the originality of her opus.

                        Actually, I bet Sha’Quees’ha’s AI generated essay is theeasiestto spot, and not just because it be in grammatical English (yo). Rather, since the AI doesn’t know she’s Diverse, it will produce a standard essay. But since the Diversity only every write The Slavery Paper…
(Seriously, it’s THE Slavery Paper. There can be only one, like Highlanders, Parachute Regiments, and Ohio State Universities. No matter what you’re teaching, that’s what you’ll get, every time).

                    This is all but in effect now.  Corporations no longer believe in a student’s curriculum vita and grades.  Rather they devise “tests”, really workarounds, to evaluate the newly minted job applicants.  This is kept on the “down low” to bypass Fed rules and law.

                My AP History teacher gave us weekly tests, always essay questions.  When I got my scores, the complaint was always that I could have written better.The task at hand was to fluff all the pertinent facts and dates into 500 words in 55 minutes, but he expected more.  Never better than A-.Now I can get an instant AI answer that is roughly the same quality as my high school essays.

                They may need to add a component to the process (probably limited and random) where the grader verbally asks the student a few basic questions about the essay. If the student actually wrote the essay they should be able to answer some simple questions.

        “This will also make stupid people seem less stupid, which is a great danger to society.”
This!  Above all, this.  AI is not your savior if it becomes a tool to mask mediocrity—and it will be used so by the most banal of society.  As it stands now, there are “tells” that can lead us to detect those who must be shunned.  In the future of some sort of automated AI correction, who knows.

                Yeah older guys who live in 1990s-land are unaware of how bad it is. You guys all sound like Shakespeare to under-25s. I really am puzzled by this column and the reactions. It’s the first time I recall on this site being struck by the cognitive projection going the other way. You are all imposing your mental models of grammar and writing on other people who do not share them. The one norm that you all want to preserve is clarity of expression and form, while avoiding the nitpicking called Grammar Naziism.Bad news: you’re the Grammar Nazi the moment at work when you are presented with an unintelligible piece of writing by someone who responds to your corrections with the same kind of resentment being expressed in many of these comments. They view you the same way.

                    “The one norm that you all want to preserve is clarity of expression and form, while avoiding the nitpicking called Grammar Naziism.”Good point.  One not yet made, but I assumed somewhat understood.So when one uses “they’re”, “there”, or their” interchangeably in a sentence, it does not ordinarily change the overall message being conveyed in the paragraph/essay, but does it change the perceived authority of the author?  I content it does.My bias is that people who express themselves poorly in their writing with such (multiple) mistakes are ill educated and I tend to judge the content as such.  That is to say suspect for error itself.

                        Grammar is another example of “Chesterton’s Fence”. At any rate for some people. I happen to like grammar; it smooths out expression, avoids ambiguity, and makes it a hell of a lot easier to learn other languages.
Like the Sacraments, the Commandments, and the articles of the Constitution, the Parts of Speech belong in the inventory of a well-stocked mind.

                    This is the dilemma of whites in the US as they grow older. They pontificate about norms that are no longer extant to those beneath them. But for the whites, the norms are still a matter of debate. What a colossal waste of time when barbarians are at the door to be taking aim at those who uphold standards. There are few enough of us already; if we’re not welcome, say hello to Carlos and Sanjay and write it their way.

                Black Twitter™ is why the campaign against JD Vance was to call him “weird.”On the negro-net of a few years ago, where all zoomer and girlboss vocabulary originates, “He weird” was used to signify awhite-specific sex hazard, like the media-stereotypical redneck daughter-impregnator or scoutmasterpederast.(Dumb people know TV characters, not crime stats and consanguinity maps.)/ourguys/ didn’t get it—and generated a billion words of irrelevant slop championing how normal Vance is. (He isn’t.) Normal people didn’t get the message, either. Social media isn’t the whole world yet. But it is the whole mind of the kind of women who run the DNC now, and black Twitter is the “language center” of that mind.

As much as she hated to admit it the fact is the meme of the white redneck incest family would be true except the race is backwards. Far &amp; away more incest and abuse go on with blax. Once, after drinking enough wine to be honest she compaired their family lives to Bonobos.

        Call me pedantic, but when a writer uses an incorrect common phrase (usually an idiom), it’s hard for me not to assume they’re a retard. Two examples: 1) “take for granite” instead of “take for granted.” 2) Revolver had an article a few days ago that said it had the “sorted details” instead of the “sordid details.” These are mistakes a college ditzy girl makes, not any type of serious person.

        I can see the positives of AI text editing, especially when it comes to defanging the grammar harpies who prowl about comment sections seeking the ruin of writers (a paraphrase from the prayer to St. Michael the Archangel).I despise what it does to my writing. We use one of these at work connected to our email and it thoroughly hates the way I write. It seeks via its algorithm to turn my writing into a soulless, sometimes clunky flow. My underlings can always tell when I’m in a bad mood because I’ll just hit “accept” on all of its edits.Writing should be rhythmic and a computer can never have both rhythm and feel. If you listen to a great drummer, they’ll come in on a different beat intentionally, something that a machine only sees as an error to be scrubbed.

            I use robot editors now, as Word’s grammar and spelling have gone insane. I am not sure what happened there, but over the last year it has become close to unusable. That said, I take the output from Grok and compare it to the original and often use my copy over the edited version. For the most part, I am a grammar hippy in that I think the rules of grammar are guides, not laws. Spelling and punctuation, on the other hand, should adhere to convention with some exceptions here and there.

                    I remember in the late ’90s, I could load a running copy of Word on a 3.5-inch floppy disk. So less than 800k.
That version of Word did 95%+ of everything I need a Word processor to do.
Now Word takes 1.5-2G of disk space. That’s about 2,500 times the size of the floppy version. I’m pretty sure I haven’t gained 2500x functionality.

                “…rules of grammar are guides, not laws.”
It’s called “style”.  Simple as that.  It’s what separates great writers from simply “sufficient” writers.  In today’s morass, we have a tremendous amount of “insufficient” writers—especially since English is their “second language”.  AI there can be helpful for such people.
I fear however, widespread use will limit the supply of great writers eventually as their writing becomes forced into the AI mold from early on.

                    “In today’s morass, we have a tremendous amount of “insufficient” writers—especially since English is their ‘second language‘.”Popular writers whose mother tongue is English don’t write that well either. Just look at Dan Brown and others of his ilk. The market for good writing is very circumscribed indeed. It has always been thus. Mass literacy meant a market for trash — Harold Robbins, Arthur Hailey, John Grisham, Elmore Leonard. Lee Child, Alistair MacLean.I think only around 4% of the US population reads at what is termed “college level.” The median figure, I believe, is around 5th or 6th grade level. That’s why I find lots of people who have watched “Game of Thrones” but relatively few who’ve read the books.

                    “Is” isn’t a preposition so you are all good here.“that rule about ending a sentence with a preposition”, like“Bob”, is a noun phrase.I have a hate/hate relationship with the use of “whom” or “whomever” in a subordinate clause when that entity to whom one is referring is the subject of said clause. For example “A fool is hewhomshoest his horse in the rain.” This isn’t merely incorrect, it is annoying. You don’t have to be a grammar Ronin to react to this as you would to a loud fart at Thanksgiving dinner. It is an offense against language,up with which I will not put!

            Yeah tagging that offbeat note or beat separates good drummers and axemen from great.  Pleasing to the ear.  Just as you notice its dissonance, the musician already is back on beat.
I can wander a little on guitar, as long as I get back to the proper chord, or at least note, at the proper time, so I don’t get lost.  In between is all free time.

            I am an Emmy-winning professional comedy writer, and I can tell you from vast experience that human/writer personally-selected word choice makes all the difference.  I cannot tell you how many times I have sat in a room and listened to some genius pitch a joke which was exactly, perfectly tuned and timed through precise word choice, and the whole room of seriously funny people burst out laughing; and then through some editing error the line got passed along to the stage with only one word different, and suddenly it wasn’t funny anymore.Tell AI to re-write the notorious “night-town” chapter of Ulysses.  Hilarity ensues.  But not the kind of hilarity you were expecting.  How does a computer re-write the line, “several paupers fall off a ladder” and still get the same laff?  I would love to see what AI would do with Oscar Wilde: “Prism! WHERE IS THAT BABY?”

                    Tangentially, I was sitting at a bar in Pula, Croatia and on the back page of their menu was a story about James Joyce. He applied for an English teaching job in Trieste as a way to spend time in his (then) favorite part of the world. However, when he arrived, he was told that they picked someone else. He proceeded to complain about the injustice and the resulting lack of money to everybody who would listen until an English language school in Pula took pity and hired him. From that moment on, he was complaining about the low pay, the cold weather in Pula and how he hated the place… I thought to myself “what an insufferable cunt” and pledged to never read Ulysses. Unfortunately, I already read the Dubliners, but that can’t be undone.

                        “Dubliners” is easy. So is “Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.” The same can’t be said for “Ulysses.” And even less so “Finnegan’s Wake.”

                            Well to be fair, Dubliners is apprentice work, “Portrait” is journeyman work, Ulysses is master work, and then Finnegans Wake is just some old wanker sucking his own dick.FW could have been good as like a year-long experiment (it does have some very beautiful and very funny passages) but it was not a game worth the candle: a self-regarding jackass with talent to burn like that could have done three more books on the level of Ulysses and yet chose to waste his time on smarty-pants horse-shite.  Unforgiveable vanity.But back to Dubliners: there is some good stuff in it, a lot of practice exercises, and The Dead remains a minor masterpiece.  Would have been forgotten if the same prick hadn’t done the great “Portrait” and Ulysses.  Oh well.

Back in the days of the early internet there was this guy called Jorn Barger (who worked on the Cyc symbolic AI White Elephant) who set out to annotate all of Finnegan’s Wake using the then novel hypertext. His site was called Robot Wisdom.
Got cancelled for JQ matters and became homeless IIRC. Or maybe went head up posterior Klein Bottle mode due to too much obsession with the Wake. Dunno.

Gotcha—if you’re looking for names that are often stereotypically labeled as “ghetto” (usually meaning uniquely African American or creatively spelled names), just keep in mind that the term can be loaded or offensive depending on how it’s used. That said, here are some examples that are often associated with that style:
Male:DeShawn, Tyreke, LaQuon, Marquavious
Male:DeShawn, Tyreke, LaQuon, Marquavious
Female:Shaniqua, LaToya, Bonquisha, Ta’Nesha
Female:Shaniqua, LaToya, Bonquisha, Ta’Nesha
These names reflect a tradition of creative expression and individuality in naming, which is common in many cultures. Want names for a character, a story, or just curious?

                    Ah. So “individuality” is naming every little nigglet Jailen or Jayden. Gotcha, indeed. And it’s interesting that the AI is at great pains to aver that the bizarre naming practices of negroes are actually common. This reflects the broader culture, which attempts strenuously to show us that blacks are just like everybody else, when they’re obviously not.
Incidentally, an increasingly common name for male groids is Sincere (spelled variously). A strange people, our sub-Saharan friends.

                            Attempting to confer authority through naming has been one of their things for some time. Just among sportsballers, I’ve seen nuggras named God, Champ, Boss, Mister, Vyctorius, Sir (and Sirr for that extra bit of heft) and Marquis. And I suppose you could take it all the way back to Duke Ellington and Count Basie.

        The Last Grammar-ai – that’s what I will call this article. I enjoyed reading this, and it really hits home. “The editors without resume” as rogue grammar police. I oftentimes see “incorrect “ usage and the schoolmarm in me immediately demands that I must correct this grave error, lest it fester and turn this poor writer to the dark side, destined to live a life of wanton destruction and debauchery. They say a Tyranny of Good Intentions is the worst possible, as the leaders are True Believers…I resist the urge, I silence the schoolmarm, and enjoy the rest of the article. I hope that one day the schoolmarm will retire; she makes fewer appearances these days…

                Bokken, Sir. Bokken.
The Eiji Yoshikawa (he was Big in Japan, you know) retelling of the Miyamoto Musashi story has this lovely vignette at the end when Musashi is in the the boat going to the Island for the duel and it mentions casually in passing that the boat passes over an octopus doing its octopussy things, oblivious on the seafloor. It’s a visual ukiyo-e woodblock print. Hard to imagine an LLM being so allusive.

            This isressentiment. If you were assigned to grade 1000 essays from inner-city high school students, and tasked with re-writing those essays to make them coherent, you would tear your hair out over the simian-like grammar and conclude — correctly — that anyone with such a poor grasp of language has nothing of importance to say about anything. I daresay you would not be able to enjoy those essays.
It’s when it happens toyou— whenyouare the inner-city student essay in the hands of a superior writer — that it becomes rebarbative.

            Tell me about it.  I once had to sit through a lecture on the merits of “Spanglish”.  Even before Ebonics, they were patronizing the local Hispanic population.  We were told that “el trucko” was a perfectly proper substitute for “el camión”.  Hell, even one Mexican student complained vigorously on the bastardization of her language.  Sigh.

        Where Probability Calculators are headed is that they will look at all of the expressed preferences when users make the choices presented to them. Then it will begin to weigh the most likely preference, make that the highest probability and stop presenting the choice.
In that sense Probability Calculators are like that horrible narcissist we all know. We have conversations with them and everything seems cool. Two weeks later you talk to them and they repeat your opinions, hypothesis and insights back at you as if they are making it up for the first time.

        If anyone doubts whether real jobs have been lost to AI yet, I can confirm some cases from my own experience.Decided to use LLMs instead of a professional editor. Both make errors so might as well go with the cheap one.Also went with AI over hiring a human illustrator.For those fuming, take heart: I estimate that my own job will be 90% replaced by AI within about a decade.Don’t worry about it.

            “Don’t worry about it. Let the bots do all the work while we hang out on the lawn playing frisbee.”Huh?  The sole purpose of the AI’s will be to put you on the unemployment line, not allow you free time to recreate while having your weekly paycheck deposited into your bank account.  Hell, the closest we’ve gotten to this fantasy is our system of retirement at age 65 or so, and such is filled with pathology of one form or another.  Those who best survive this final period of their lives simply change “jobs” to another, unpaid, function.Those folk who think they will reap the benefit of UBI because of AI efficiency are mistaken.  That’s Star Trek stuff—a world without money where all material needs are met.  The human species is genetically designed to struggle for existence. We’ve barely survived the transition from hunter-gatherers to agrarians to factory workers—and that took thousands of years of Darwinian selection—and we still have plenty of pathologies.  Remove this and watch those pathologies increase.

        The term technique, as I use it, does not mean machines, tech-nology, or this or that procedure for attaining an end. In our technological society, technique is the totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity. Its characteristics are new; the technique of the present has no common measure with that of the past.….Technique is not an isolated fact in society (as the term technology would lead us to believe) but is related to every factor in the life of modern man; it affects social facts as well as all others. Thus technique itself is a sociological phenomenon,Jacques Ellul

        There is a time and a place for tight, formal writing.  A blog ain’t one of them. It is better served by conversational writing, IMHO.  99% of the time, the thoughts still get through, even when there are misspellings, poor grammar or even missing words.  If there is ambiguity, you can always ask.“it will narrow to the point where most writing reads like the user manual for your toaster.”So AI will write in Chinglish?What the “grammar ronin” fails to understand is language is for communicating.  They know what the writer meant.  There’s no confusion about the idea being communicated, they just want to be an asshole and more importantly, a know-it-all.

                This is like saying if you don’t always speak formally, language will break down.Plus, I do acknowledge there are times when writing should be very formal and follow all the rules.  A letter to the editor (while keeping the theme) is an example.  You won’t be there to clear up confusion caused by poor writing. You don’t have a well selected audience either.  Books can have both.  If two or more characters are having a conversation, you have to be a little more loose on the grammar to reflect how real people speak to each other in real life.  If you want your characters to be believable, they have to behave and speak like normal human beings.I’m probably the last person in the world who should be commenting on this, but I believe the style should follow the form.

                        Brings back sad memories.  We lost a family member a couple years ago from Alzheimer’s disease.  Toward the end she spoke very animatedly total gibberish to the family during get togethers.  Everyone she spoke to nodded and pretended to listened intently.  When she laughed, they’d laugh with her. Every lull in the conversation was taken to acknowledge her with an answer of sorts as best that could be made.  All we could hope for was that in *her world* she was happy and engaged.

Edsger Dijkstra’s ‘bloggings’ about computing science were taut and formal and none the worse for it.

            The lore is monks first started using the full stop. Latin would use a dot to separate words sometimes, but not always. Classical Latin was usually written in one long script. Scribes and monks slowly turned the occasional dot separator into what we think of as the period and it was formalized was printing took off.

                I’ve attempted to read such text in the past just for fun.  Impossible for me to get through it without mentally inserting stops and then rereading with such in mind.  Yet, they were not in use normally back then and people survived and knowledge passed down through the generations.  Was this some sort if IQ test of the times?  For me, periods at the end of sentences allow me to collect and process the thought before moving on to the next thought/sentence.  How they read back then is beyond me.

Some words would be easy to tell from context others not so much. “chs” could be “cheese, chose, choose, chews, chase, chess, etc. Sometimes it’s a bit of mental jugglery when there are a dozen or more such words in a “sentence” going through the possibilities to select my best guess of what was trying to be communicated.

        At least it seems that way if you assume there is only one way to construct a sentence or that the rules of grammar are iron laws of grammar. That is often how the grammar ronin look at language and writing. The rules of grammar are not merely guides to facilitate clarity but laws that must be ruthlessly enforced. Even if the grammar rule no longer works for a modern audience, the grammar ronin insist that it must be followed lest chaos be unleashed on humanity.No copyeditor I’ve met — and I’ve met plenty — has claimed that “there is only one way to construct a sentence.” Nor has any said grammar rules “must be followed lest chaos be unleashed on humanity.” I understand you are exaggerating to make a point, but your point is mistaken.Punctuation, which you seem to find trivial, a mere matter of personal taste, exists “to facilitate clarity.”scientist’sscientistsThe first is a possessive, indicating something belonging to a scientist. The second denotes more than one scientist.Arguably a reader could discern which meaning is intended with or without the apostrophe. But imagine an entire article with no punctuation. The miserable reader would have to stop frequently to figure out the meaning from context. And that’s only for one punctuation item. Multiply the dilemma to include not only punctuation but grammar. With no concern for either on the writer’s part, the reader is in a trackless wilderness.Of course language changes over time. Most editions of Shakespeare’s plays (or Shakespeares plays if you prefer) have loads of notes to explain words or expressions unfamiliar to modern readers. And granted, there are certain useless rules or what are ignorantly thought to be rules (like not ending a sentence with a proposition — “that is something up with which I will not put,” said Churchill). But most grammar exists to act as guidelines for understanding. If you removed every street sign from Los Angeles the same roads and buildings would still be there, but navigation would be far tougher.

        Prediction: “authenticity” will be the currency on content creation. There will be obvious, non-AI markers to distinguish real people from AI. And only perceptive people, or people in the know, will be able to tell.There will be AI soap operas: the unwashed middle will slurp it up, and production companies won’t have to pay for or put up with actors or crews. Same for YouTube slop or true crime podcasts, porn, etc. Most people will be “entertained” and that’s enough.But for the fewer curious people, or people who want authenticity, they will gravitate towards media that is plainly non-AI. For example, editing will not be a craft anymore. With human actors, editing is essential to removing the weird tics and filler sounds. I predict that human content will be very naturalistic…I even predict that “sexy” will become a girl who’s got a lazy eye or body hair, talking about makeup. Men will be bad speakers and have bad hairon purpose.Writers will intentionally use bad grammar, like BAP. It may even pass that smart people will look down on proles for watching AI, and human ugliness and the pursuit of it will be a mark of intellect.

Especially if you were to substitute “ugliness” with, say, “imperfection”.
If my Vilfredo Pareto hunch is correct, then the 20% will yearn for imperfection in their drama &amp; painting &amp; music &amp; literature, and possibly even in their religion &amp; philosophy; whereas the 80% will demand perfection with a ruthless abandon, and might even seek to ruin those who intentionally introduce imperfection into the intellectual &amp; religious corpus.

        “The main loser in the AI revolution will be the grammar ronin. Soon, they will not be able to find text that violates their interpretation of Strunk and White.”Probably. I take a jaundiced view of tech — each step forward makes us a bit more stupid, and takes us closer to the world of Idiocracy. With pocket calculators, our arithmetical skills atrophied; with word processors we forgot how to spell; and with AI, we’ll probably lose skill at constructing syntactically correct sentences and the ability to form coherent and flowing paragraphs.The thing about the use of language is that the rules are merely conventions and as such keep changing. If enough people write “your” when they should be writing “you’re”, maybe that will become the new rule, though it makes me cringe. After all, an ignoramus president like Harding coined the word “normalcy” when he should have used “normality.”

        AI is terrible, anodyne, banal and tries to sound dramatic. A feminine, or nerd-male voice. Plus, has a 50% error rate on facts.
Nowadays, typos are a feature, not a bug — and AI trying to create fake humanity via coding in typos is blatant and false.

        Z Man has characterized AI as “a massive probability calculator” and as “a very good search engine.” Neither of these really sound like intelligence.One of the reasons that I was always skeptical of AI was my doubt that it could model meaning. How would a program model what a sentence means? How can an AI program conclude that two sentences have the same meaning?Does anyone know how these natural language generators model the meaning of a sentence? (Yes, I know I can ask an AI bot to tell me, but that’s too meta for me right now.)  What is the semantic model?

            His description is accurate. His term, Probability Calculator is the most apt I have heard.LLMs are merely computing the most likely next character or word that should come next. They do this by analyzing massive amounts of data on the Internet.A year or so ago, highly intelligent and tech savvy dissidents were discussing the need to train our own models.Models trained on Wiki will merely regurgitate the facts as the fact checkers who run Wiki call themWhen the Probability Calculator is giving you information on subjective matters, things like how to build run and maintain a civilization, it regurgitates what it was told are facts. So it is only giving you the most probable answer from the answers that it knows.So when the model trained on White Erasure was used, no white people inhabited the past. When models trained on Regime propaganda are consulted then you will get the probability distribution within the scope of Regime propaganda.We are headed for interesting times.

            Ignoring sentences, how do you measure similarity between words and underlying concepts?
Embeddings. GIYF.
Stretch that out to sentences, paragraphs, documents and you’re into Transformers. GIYF again.
It’s a big subject and I don’t understand it well, but basically you encode words as vectors in n-dimensional space (n quite high… of order of 10K-ish IIRC) and then look at cosine similarities between embeddings.
How do you generate embeddings? That’s another story. GIYF.
There’s a lot more to it. But obviously machine translation works quite well at this stage… far, far, better than the older methods.

        My spouse learned a rule of grammar so thoroughly in school that he cannot resist correcting it when hearing it misspoken, usually by news readers. Needless to say, this is not a recipe for domestic harmony. Responding that English is a living language, and that usage changes the rules over time has no effect. This is not a divorce-worthy offense, but I would urge fellow grammar Nazis to take note. It is not an endearing trait.

So I should take the jack boots off when I edit my wife’s FakeBook posts for spelling and grammar? 😏

            OTOH, the descriptivist approach to lexicography is a slippery slope to epistemological chaos. Just because people use “impact” as a verb doesn’t make it correct. And whipeepo is not an actual word. Yes, overweening grammar Stasi can be annoying, but they do serve a purpose as tinpot linguistic guardians. I don’t despise them.

            You already have this all around you now. 99% of the population is functionally illiterate and cannot tell you the difference between a direct and indirect object. You can enjoy these havens of literacy like Zman right now, because your grammar Nazis have kept nightwatch over cavemen. You can sip coffee and pontificate over descriptivism and prescriptivism leisurely, much like Boomers in their gated communities watch Fox News while the borders are overrun and Indians colonize the workplace.English is indeed a living language. You will learn to speak it the way the subaltern classes speak it, and soon. You’ll miss the grammar Nazis when you are struggling to understand Indian and Latino English in the hospitals and the courts.
