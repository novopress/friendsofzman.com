        If a “respectable”  candidate like Kasich or Christie would start using some of Trump’s arguments, he’d see his numbers shoot up.

        Kristol is irrelevant, he just doesn’t know it yet. Trump, without even trying, has tapped into the zeitgeist of the disaffected majority of the Republican party. There is nothing the Establishment can do about this.
Buckaroo Banzai, I enjoyed your comments on Reagan. I’ve always thought that in many ways his intellect and conservative ideals, his sheer love for America were under-appreciated. The Left thought they could destroy him, but the average person wasn’t buying their spin. We could really use a Reagan right about now.

        Billly is doing dads work, Irving Kristol-“One can say that the historical task and political purpose of neo-conservatism would seem to be this: to convert the Republican party, and American conservatism in general, against their respective wills, into a new kind of conservative politics suitable to governing a modern democracy.”
It’s not the rats, it’s the fleas.

        These guys like Kristol are pretty smug fellows. Of course being a creature of omnipotant status quo has its benefits in a banana republic. You get to be right because you control the message, until you aren’t.But being the right wing of cultural marxism it is still gross hubris no matter how they brand their faction of the oligarchy.I think they are not intelligent enough to understand the dynamics here.Trump is the last chance they have to redeem themselves.Last chance for them, last chance for republican form of government.It don’t matter if Trump wins or not, it doesn’t matter if Trump is a nice guy, genuine article, or not.Trump IS the message.The message is not that Trump is a winner or can win, or loose, the message is he is winning because this plurality will not be denied any longer. This message is probably the single greatest political signal in memory. If the Kristol’s are missing the gravity of this message, they and their political powers are really toast, fucking dumber than a box of rocks.If they are not out of desperation spinning this reality of a plurality they have no power over, which has withdrawn it consent, and are ignorant of its implications, their time is truly up. Their time is up anyway really.That message has superseded everything. It is a plurality talking. It is attaining critical mass.It is a plurality that doesn’t quite yet know it is one, but it is beginning to understand its legitimacy.The dynamics are so volatile and complex, there aint no one who can predict what will go down here. But the energy of something really big is building. It is unstoppable. It is also grass roots in nature. Totally outside the sphere of the current political embrace of cause and effect. Its flying’ below the radar. It is an insurgent force.Trump is hanging ten like a Pro surfing a tital wave of smoldering tolerance.Anybody who says the guy is a buffoon doesn’t have their head screwed on right.Trump isn’t a Presidential candidate, wether he groks this or not, Trump is a naturally born symbol of bitter clinging right wing extremist rebellion and revolt, of withdrawal of consent. Trump is the stalking horse of a plurality who have had enough.

        I am registered as a Republican only so I can disrupt the party line by voting for the most provocative choices, and so I can vote in the primaries. Of course, being in California, my vote has exactly zero relevance to anything. I would leave the Republican Party in a NY minute if there was a legitimate, big time alternative that actually represented my preferences.  I don’t think I am the only one that feels this way.  If the Republican leadership had any idea of how many of their own party members felt like I do…Wait, of course they do.  They are using the party membership count to justify that they are mainstream and relevant.  Maybe I need to rethink this party membership thing.The problem is the party I hate is less unattractive than the one I despise with every fiber of my being.  The lesser of evils, so to say.

        That is a magnificent address by Reagan. I grew up listening to the liberal media continuously mocking Reagan as a folksy moron and a “C” student, so it was challenging for me to uncover the evidence and come to grips with the fact that he was in fact a self-taught intellectual giant of conservatism who towered over his peers. He was the right man at the right time– his first career as an actor served him mightily during the peak of the network television era, and those skills combined with his deep and thorough understanding of conservative principles put him in such stark relief to the political landscape that he could reach a most critical bloc of voters. Those being, of course, what I might call the hypnotized conservatives: people who were actually conservative but couldn’t express it politically because they had been well brainwashed by the left.Donald Trump actually reminds me of Ronald Reagan. Not that he is in any way similar to Reagan– that would be absurd– but because he is someone who has the right skills and experience required to reach this critical bloc of voters at this particular point in time. And arguably, Trump is actually in an even better position to succeed today than Reagan was in late 70s/early 80s.Of course, Trump utterly lacks the intellectual firepower of Reagan. In a properly functioning world, this would be a substantial demerit– but in today’s climate of thoroughgoing moral and intellectual degeneracy, it is a huge plus. Today, Reagan’s fancy talk would make him come across like a fag and a retard (http://youtu.be/A6CZ2J8gJtk) but Trump isn’t burdened that way. Where carefully reasoned and enunciated conservative principles, skillfully and manfully delivered by a master craftsman via network TV were once sufficient to awaken a sleeping conservative, our times require fairly simple utterances of common sense, metered  in superficially outrageous, politically-incorrect sound bites, and delivered in a combative and aggressive style honed through years of reality-TV on-screen experience.So, Trump’s apparent weakness is actually a strength. And even better, Trump’s strengths are even bigger strengths. Real estate developers have to grapple with politicians at a state, local, and even national level on a daily basis–and he’s been doing that for over thirty years. He knows what buttons to push and which levers to pull to get his way. It’s no accident that he’s been able to make the rest of the Republican field look like buffoons; he’s been having his way with politicians at all levels for decades. Not only that, but he’s had to use those skills to create value in the real world. That’s a challenge that no career politician has ever even faced– much less succeeded at.The final piece of the puzzle is money. Trump has it. This means nobody owns him, or can even hope to own him. Not only that, it allows him to own other people’s valuable services. Career politicians have to rely on volunteers and shape-shifting career-oriented political campaign professionals who always have their eye on the main chance. Trump can hire people loyal only to him, and win or lose, those people–assuming they demonstrated value– know they will have a job with Trump doing SOMETHING even if he is not elected, because he works in the value-creating private sector.This last point is huge. Reagan had an inner circle of loyalists which got him elected, but was dependent on Republican Party professional hacks to fill out the rest of his administration– hacks that his Vice President, George Bush, pretty quickly got control of, which wound up derailing the “Reagan Revolution” before it ever really got off the ground.As a Republican, Trump will have to completely hijack the Republican Party and reform it in his own image to succeed. But I think he has sized up the party’s state of accelerating collapse, and realizes that he can jump in and seize the infrastructure mostly intact, thus saving the trouble of building a third party from the ground up. Bill Kristol’s comments suggests he sees this as well; but does he really think that building a third party on the fly would be that much easier for him than it would be for anyone else? I know nothing about Bill Kristol other than the way he comes across on TV, which is as a smug, supercilious douchebag. But if he’s been dictating the party nominees for the last decade, maybe he does have the power to pull it off.

            Excellent analysis.  I was originally a strong Cruz supporter and he is the most excellent conservative politician in America but I doubt that he can win as the electorate is currently constituted (i e much more heterogeneous than Reagan years).  On the other-hand, Trump strikes me as the right man with the right attributes at the right time.  In my gut I feel that he can win in a landslide no matter what the RINO establishment thinks or does.
