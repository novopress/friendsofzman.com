        well let me scare the bejesus out of you right now…  sometime in April or May Hillary will fold her pantsuits and go home,  and Michelle Obama will come parading to the rescue of a decrepit Democratic party and will utilize the resources of the taxpayers to engineer another Obama term.   You heard it here first,  from my cave in the mountains

        Efrem Zimbalist jr. left the FIB  building long ago. It would however be interesting to know the inside politics of exactly why and who it was that permitted 150 agents so choice a bone to chew. This can’t have happened without Obama’s stooges at Justice giving the nod.

        As the FBI closes in, by circumventing the DOJ, I suspect Ms. Clinton will “unexpectedly” want to spend more time with her family, and continue with the demands of “her”  philanthropic administration pursuits, perhaps citing the overwhelming stress of fighting the neverending Vast Right Wing Conspiracy,and limited resources against “domestic operatives” that the IRS failed to ensnare.I could be wrong of course.

        I dunno.  Yeah, she’ll skate on the charges, but…. since that alone is rock solid proof (as if any more were needed) that we live under a government of men, not laws, why not simply roll with Hillary?  It’s not as if Obama can’t convene a “blue ribbon commission” that finds, with great sadness, that while “mistakes were made,” nothing is technically actionable here, and so pardons all around.  Maybe Huma Abedin gets a few years at the honor farm as a sop to the rubes.The Dems are certainly contemptuous enough of their base to do  it.  And they’re right to be — remember Marion Berry?  It’s not like the Lena Dunhams, the ghetto dwellers, and the long-deceased of this world are gonna suddenly start voting Republican.  Plus, giving yet another tut-tutting speech about the dreaded curse of partisanship is like catnip to Obama.  Throw in the certainty of being the Savior of the Party by absolving Hillary — who he hates, let’s remember; he’d love publicly salting her wounds — and you’ve got a legal-enough scenario to keep the whole caesarist farce going.[N.b. I still think this is Fauxcahontas’s best shot, and she’d be a fool not to do it — Diversity Bingo is the only strategy they’ve got left, and “woman” is the only empty square.  But a big Obama forgiveness speech, plus some huge media-created distraction, would be enough to get Hillary over the hump.  If the media starts suddenly touting some bizarre lifestyle thing as the new civil rights crusade of the 21st century, you can bet they’re going to try to brazen it out with Hillary].

        Agree with the Biden comments.  If he wants to be President, Hillary will be doing a perp-walk.
Her released emails have already been found to contain Chris Stevens’ travel and security plans.  The nail in her political coffin will be when the FBI ties her carelessness and Blumenthal’s hacked email account directly to the coordinated attack that killed Stevens.

        I see a Supreme Court departure of a liberal, with Biden as the only nominee who can get through the Senate.Then Hillary goes in as VP, possibly even ascending to President when Obama departs early, and everybody pardons everybody.Hillary then finishes last after Governor Gary Johnson the Libertarian, who is promoted aggressively by the MSM in order to split the Trump vote.President Trump, with his AG Cruz and the Tea Party Congress, then carry out a historic restructuring, with elimination of entire departments and massive downsizings of regulatory agenciesFuture historians will call the coming period The Trump Restoration.  It is God’s way of making Progressives and Academia understand and appreciate Constitutional Restraint and the Rule of Law.

        Joe Biden to the rescue.  He has masterfully played the game of staying out of sight while setting up the move.  Wait and see, candidate paperwork just happened to have been filed all along.  He is also probably the only Dem who has a chance of going toe to toe with Trump or Cruz and coming out of it in one piece. He also will not need to sully himself with attendance at those awful Democrat party debates.

        I think you’re right. There’s no way she’ll be held to account for this stuff. The people who allow such things to happen may not like her much, but she’s one of their own.
If she turned on them, sure. But fat chance of that; she’s a Democrat, after all.
She’s safe. She’ll be our next president.
They’ve done a black guy, now a woman. What’s next? Bruce Jenner?

        As I’ve said all along, she will not be her party’s nominee. Her baggage has become an onerous burden on the Democratic Party. They are nervous, sweating, wringing hands. They know the winds have changed and are no longer in their favor. Maybe she will be indicted, maybe not. The stench of corruption grows stronger. She is not popular among any group except the die-hard Kool-aid drinkers. Everyone (Dems) else is either voting for The Bern, or hoping that Hilary will develop a brain tumor, rendering her incapable of carrying the Progressive banner. Enter Joe Biden.

        Mark Dayton is a mental patient. Nobody is going to nominate him for President. What’s wrong with Jim Webb? Couldn’t he be resurrected ?
