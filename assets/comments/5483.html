        We shouldn’t worry too much about the details and mechanisms of the left’s craziness. It’s like trying to figure out why your crazy girlfriend had a particular meltdown. It’s counterproductive. Better to devote the time and energy to getting rid of her. She’s fucking nuts, it’s not gonna change, case closed, now do something about it!
The left mostly just assumes that normal people are incomprehensibly malignant inhuman beasts, like Grendel, and gets on with the business of hating us and trying to screw us.
Who’s been more successful?

        No offence to conservative Christians, but welfare liberalism is in may ways like a religion…they believe that people can be ‘saved’ if enough tax payer money is wasted to bring everyone to the same level.

        Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims  etc. are very adept at pointing out all of the ills of white run systems from small businesses to National Governments.  The list of grievances is so long that it should make the aggrieved want to get as far away from whites as possible.  But, no, they come by boat, plane, raft, wet ankles, and hot box trucks just to be where “the white wimmens” are.  I don’t get it.  If whites are as bad as the rabble contend, shouldn’t they all be trying to stay in  or return to their “homeland” ?The only “white guilt” I feel is the guilt for not having done more to advance white society further even if it be at the expense of non-whites.  There, I said it.

        Superb. Thank you Zman.I just finished a weekend art festival in Evanston, Illinois. It was full immersion in Lib-Concentrate.The shared idea is, “the world as it should be, not as it is.”This is a good idea regarding water filtration, growing food and developing new surgical techniques.But at the fair it also included eternal youth, saving Syrian refugees with no understanding of why it’s happening, and that if only the good white people can be allowed to finish transgressing traditional culture can it be made on earth as it is in Heaven.Methinks the author is correct; the belief system will result in the eventual biological extinction of the believers through lack of family formation.That would be the end of the Protestant Reformation. Thank God.
