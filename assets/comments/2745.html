        In the black community this thing is seen quite differently than the white libs think it was seen, or should be. Many see it as more opression from the white man. Too bad they don’t place the blame where it belongs – they look at team owners and see republicans.

        A small part of my consciousness believes that there is something else going on with this Ray Rice thing, that it is consciously pushing gender relations to the forefront.  It is holding up an example of a women standing up for herself and getting persecuted for it.  Since every last bleepin’ thing is political now, could this be a set-up for a certain politician’s wife or a fake Indian to take center stage for the next couple of years?  Part of the media/political game is to dictate the landscape surrounding the discussion.  I sense a picked-on-but-tough-woman landscaping session going on.  Taking down football makes it a twofer.

        What makes the Ray Rice saga difficult for The Cult is that it is as much about race as about gender.  Not every man hits women, even if justified in self-defense.  Some do, but that’s no reason to indict all men as so many of the PC Cult members are doing. The statistics are unequivocal that violence against women is more common among African-American men than those of other racial groups, in line with the general statistics on crime of almost every kind.  The Cult has to make the Ray Rice story one about the violence of MEN so it does not become a story about the criminality of BLACKS.  Of course, this puts the NFL between a rock and a hard place because of the racial divide that exists between the League’s white owners and its predominately black players.My personal view is that what went on in the elevator between Rice and his then girlfriend is a private affair between them and/or a criminal affair for the police and the courts to deal with.  In the absence of any proven criminality NO employer—the NFL included—should be able to fire an employee because of what he does “off the field.”   I have no sympathy for the NFL, however. What’s going on is a mess of their own making, the result of a collective bargaining agreement to which both the League and the Players Association signed on.  Both sides agreed to a PC provision in the labor contract that allows the League to punish players for their off the field infractions.  Now they have to live with it.  Tough.And BTW, it’s not obvious to me from watching the video clip shown on TMZ, even in slow motion, who started the fight in the elevator and who hit first.  Rice’s girlfriend (now wife) is certainly no tiny wallflower.  She’s looks like in flats she’s every bit as tall as he is and maybe even taller than him in heels.  The fact is, violence by women against men is widely ignored and greatly underreported.  Lots of women start fights with men, beginning with verbal abuse and then progressing to actual hitting, expecting NOT to be struck back.  I will always walk away from verbal abuse, but if someone strikes me first, I will damn well strike back, regardless of my attacker’s gender.  It’s a policy of deterrence I believe in.

        Anything that shows Obama’s incompetence is swept under the rug. The liberal media is trying to fan a race war. Reporting the news comes secondary, and don’t dare implicate Muslims or blacks ever.
