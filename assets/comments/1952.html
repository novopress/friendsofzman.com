        I’d like to see everyone that is on the public dole or collecting a paycheck from the state (bureaucrats,  public school teachers, police, military, etc.) excluded from voting.
There’s a conflict of interest and there are enough of these people that elections can be bought.

        There are people who were in the military who think that you have to earn the right to vote: if you are willing to die for your country only then can you vote for it. Those who are freeloading have no say.From the left-side of the spectrum this idea has huge problems, because the only people who will vote aren’t going to be interested, by and large, in things like ethnic minority education programs, or something like putting people with no experience in charge of important things ‘just for show.’‘Power to the people’ may be a catchy phrase but often it hasn’t worked out well. The people can be dissolute and easily manipulated and under it all what they want is simply more free stuff, irrespective of consequence. Not their problem. But the idea that people will collectively do the smart thing has frequently proved somewhat  wide of the mark.There is also the very real truth that democracy is an act once every few years that takes a short amount of time. Those elected by democracy then need have no further recourse to anything but what they personally want. Casting a vote based on vague promises and wish-lists issued by the rich and powerful (left or right) doesn’t make those at the top ‘accountable’ and merely diverting people’s attention once every few years is an easy way of making sure that control stays with the controllers. However, in case the voters don’t approve of what is happening then a lot of effort goes into spin and information suppression in order to feed the voters soothing stories and offer ‘gifts’ that will placate them for the next election.The problem with democracy is it dominates life in the west. The concern for it by the elite means it must be our concern too; thus it stays as the sole topic of conversation and the main plank of thinking in many aspects of life. Everything from health and education to foreign relations and immigration become distorted to a level of approved dishonesty in order to win the next votes. In the meantime the need for garnering ‘approval’ from those who voted once a long time ago means there is a whole culture of untruth and deception and a lack of honesty.The demand for more democracy usually translates as ‘more of what certain group wants’ and you can see why ancient kings and lords would be amused by the concept. Why nurture a system where feckless ingrates can change their mind and ‘vote’ a comfortable life out of power?So we are instructed to be obsessed with the theory, even if it proves to encourage insipid, ineffectual government. True the people have spoken, but it was only once, and they can then be safely dismissed for a while.
