        There’s nothing inevitable about tetrapods, much less anthropoid apes. There’s no reason to imagine an alien would be as familiar-seeming to us as a tarantula.
It’ll probably have some number of legs and eyes and mouths, somewhere.

        “… they will have long ago figured out how to upload their consciousness into the machine …” But why should they? A “me” consciousness loaded (up or down) is no longer Me. The ruling class in such an “evolved” society might be civilized Greek-like and enslave the more intelligent for assigned use, but up- or downloading is not for the rulers.

            I don’t know. What if your mind could be loaded into a repairable body of your choosing? Like buying clothes, you buy different bodies for different occasions. Your body becomes a fashion item. For the trip to Mars you have a body able to withstand the Martian atmosphere. For deep space you have a body able to withstand the radiation of space.My point is that in 10,000 years we went from living under trees wearing skins to living as we do today. We look different than we did 10,000 years ago. We think differently and we have different inter-species relationships. In 10,000 years, who knows what we will be like.

        I’m decades removed from the popular/technical literature on evolution; however, I was never a fan of the fine-tuned Universe argument and conclusions that carbon-based DNA/RNA coding systems are the only show in town.  We don’t have any alternative reference points.  Gould’s Wonderful Life rationally discussed the apparently random outcomes that produced the dominant morphology and intelligent life.
