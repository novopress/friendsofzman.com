        In C.S. Lewis’ Till We Have Faces, the High Priest of Ungit started all the trouble, because he was about to lose his life style. The King went along, happily, sacrificing one of his children to the god. The pundits and writers you mention are the high priests of the so-called conservative culture, the billionaires who support them are the King. Trump is a plague upon their land. They have to destroy him.

        “The reality is our opinion makers are all kept men. They are the monks and clergy of our age, shaping intellectual life and setting the limits of what is and what is not permitted in the public sphere. This is done mostly to promote their own position, but financed by the donor class, on whose behalf the monks and priests of the commentariat work.”
So much this!

        If Progs are a Christian heresy, then:1. MLK, JFK, and Lincoln are the Holy Trinity2. Equalism is the promised land.3. Hitler is the devil.4. Universities are the churches, think tanks are the monasteries (thanks ZMan!)5. Whiteness is the original sin.6. Giving away your priviledge (land, jobs, daughters) is the path to salvation.If we are to believe purely evolutionary (by natural selection) explanations for the human race, then cults like Progs, which are self abnegating, go against everything that evolution claims organisms are put on earth to do. I think evolution by natural selection explains a lot, but not Progs. Only the devil can explain Progs. Not particularly religous, but I honestly can’t think of any other explanation for how many people would be so suicidal.If your religion will lead to your extinction, like Progs, then you are possessed. If your religion leads to flourishing of you and your people, like the Mormons, then the divine spark is there somewhere among the magic underwear.Just my 2 pennies

        I once assumed that the internet would end the information monopoly and facilitate a great increase in acquiring knowledge and understanding. How could it not? Tocqueville was not fooled. “When people are free to do what they want, they will seek to be alike.” There are many comforts in being alike in an opinion, and only one in being alone.

        One of my pet projects is compiling a lexicon of our modern monasteries’ output.  Just like the average college student can’t read Aquinas anymore without special training, in a generation or two nobody will have any idea what baffling words like “cisgender” mean.  And hey, I’m Irish, so I’m just carrying on the noble traditions of my people (see also: my drinking habits).  Nice Jan Hus reference, by the way, but you’re wrong about all the think tanks being in the pocket of billionaires — as we all know, the RAND Corporation works for the Reverse Vampires.

        “Ooooh, that’s a bingo!  That’s how you say it?”“Nah, we just say “Bingo!””You need to count in the “research for hire” these guys also do.  Years ago doing some work in the ME, had to hire Ken Pollock at Brookings (a former senator was one of my firm’s board members and also on the Brookings board).  Nice guy, but basically six figures for something sub’d out to some 15 buck an hour RAs.–but the risk evaluation had his stamp on it.  It’s quite the racket.  Plus a couple autographed copies of the “Path Out of the Desert”.  Anybody want one?

            Years ago I was given the task of crunching numbers for a quality project run by some big shot Six Sigma people. It quickly became apparent that they were innumerate. They had been trained to look for certain graph shapes. At least that’s what I suspected. Once I got the handle on what they were looking for I gaffed the data and made up a bunch of charts that looked the way they wanted. Since it was near impossible to get to the data set it was clear no one really cared. I got some free travel out of it with very little work required. Faking the data is pretty easy.There’s a reason that raw data is closely guarded.

                I doubt anyone on the Exec Committee even read the Brookings output…it was all about having the imprint.  Ended up recommending holding on making the investment as it was clear just from walking around in the UAE that this was a bubble (2007) and the same assets could be acquired later for a lot less capital.  Which they were in 2011.    But the think tanks have a great racket and easy to see why they are so ripshit about Trump. He’s the little kid who keeps getting air time to point out yet again that they seem to have left their clothes at home and have small wee-wees.

        […] I’ve pointed out previously that the non-profit rackets have become an enormous problem in American politics. One remedy is to pull the plug on the tax provisions that allow donors to deduct their donations. That draws down money flowing into these things. Another way, one that would have to apply to super-PAC operations, is to have full disclosure of all donors and the amount of their contribution. […]

        This is a nitpick, but I’m not as erudite and have no idea what to make of the Frederic III reference.I went to Wikipedia and they provided a list of Frederick III’s they have articles on:Frederick III, Duke of Upper Lorraine (c. 1020–1033)Frederick III of Sicily (1272–1337), also known as Frederick II of SicilyFrederick III of Germany (1289–1330), nicknamed the Fair, King of the RomansFrederick III the Simple (1341–1377), King of SicilyFrederick III, Holy Roman Emperor (1415–1493)Frederick III, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1424–1495)Frederick III, Elector of Saxony (1463–1525)Frederick III, Elector Palatine (1515–1576)Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (1597–1659)Frederick III of Denmark (1609–1670)Frederick III of Brandenburg (1657–1713), also Frederick I of Prussia, Elector of BrandenburgFrederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1699-1772)Frederick III, German Emperor (1831–1888)Which one is the reference to?

        That’s for spelling out this particular piece of corruption for us.
I don’t think monks are a very good analogy for paid propagandists.  These people are doing the same thing that writers for Pravda used to do.  While the Catholic Church came up with the term “propaganda” their abilities have for a long time been surpassed by secular organizations.

        Those interested in the history of Europe and the monks would do well to read Christopher Dawson. Those interested in a fictionalized post-nuclear-holocaust history involving monks and the dissemination of preserved knowledge should read Walter Miller, Jr.’s “A Canticle for Leibowitz”. Those interested in living a life on the fringes might have a look at the works of Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu and Han Shan, among others. True hermits and monks are anything but “kept” men and live anonymous lives.

            Canticle for Leibowitz was one of those books I read in high school…Then a couple years ago a local small bookstore was closing, it’s owner had died and the kids were liquidating the place.Got a couple Heinlen novels, plus…A Canticle for Leibowitz and a few other novels, and a mayonnaise jar of pre-1982 pennies, and a ceramic dog my son (at the time he was 3) had his eye on, all for $10.If we hadn’t been on the way to the park, and “somebody” wanted to go, I would have stayed longer and looked for more books, but it wasn’t to be.

                I was 15 when I read it (1961),stayed up all night, read it right through. Still had quite a bit to learn before I could truly appreciate it, but I’ve read it twice a year since and no longer lend out copies, as I never get them back. The 1997 posthumous sequel is not as good, but worth reading if for no other reason that the obvious zen elements introduced. That novel, along with the works of the others mentioned, made me promise myself 50 years ago that if I made it to old age, I’d be a kind of Taoist-Sen recluse in a rural area and ended up keeping the promise. Had a widely-traveled, exciting and in may ways rewarding life, but I’ve never been happier or more at peace.Paring away the material makes one realize how little importance it has. Life without a metaphysical/philosophical aim is sadly little more than mere existence, no matter how much comfort,luxury and diversion one can acquire, and I has my share before renouncing it quite some time back, having secured basic needs.
