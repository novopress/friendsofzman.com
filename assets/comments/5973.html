        A ruling elite whose core beliefs rest upon absurd and demonstrable falsehoods is both deluded and short-lived.  As our rulers will soon discover.  Either their views must come to tack more closely with hard-edged reality, or their will be a new ruling elite.  A dogmatic faith in unicorns and leprechauns is proving to be something of a liability and a hindrance when coping with a dangerous and unpredictable world.

        I remember having a discussion with a Swedish cab driver in Gothenburg  about 5 years ago. (and no, his name was not Sven or Ole) I asked him how he liked living in Sweden – he was from Iraq- he replied in the negative- unemployment too high, lines at the hopspital too long and on and on. I couldn’t help but notice too, that my Swedish (and I have never lived there, only visited) was WAY better than his, and he’d been there 5 years. I’m guessing my Swedish is still better than his. The Swedes have taken their penchant  for individual suicide and expanded it out to a societal program. Well, done, Sven and Lena!

            My experience is slightly different, though nothing to do with the Arab mindset. I was served at a supermarket by a young lady from Romania. Attractive, smart and perfect English after 2 years in the UK. She told me she had also lived in Italy for 5 years so I presume she had a good grasp of Italian too.I asked her what she disliked about the UK and she was quick to say the benefits system. For a moment I thought she was going to say “not enough, not free enough” and the sort of thing the brain-dead lefties trot out. Instead, to my amazement, she said: “You are too generous with giving money to people who don’t deserve it or shouldn’t be here.” Her argument was that you go to a country to be part of it and make contribution, not take what you can get without giving back.Where I used to live there were dozens and dozens of muslim taxi drivers, whose English was passable but rarely knew their way round town. But then if they wanted a day off they often had their brothers and cousins drive the cab whether they were qualified or not, so I doubt if Ahmed has passed on any information to Mo, Curly and Larry (or whatever their Arab names are).But I was greatly heartened by the no-nonsense understanding of the Romanian lady. If all immigrants were as sharp as her, and as willing to be part of society, there would be no problem.

        Sure we can…all screening interviews are conducted in rooms with dogs present, the only food offered interviewees contains pork, all facial coverings must come off women who are interviewed by Jewish men,…
Trump doesn’t go far enough. Ann Coulter does in her book “Adios America” – stop ALL immigration for at least five years or longer.

        All the evidence anyone can need is the obvious fact that muslims leave muslim countries because they don’t like them, but they don’t stop being muslims. If they find the results of the imposition of islam so unappealing you would think they would ditch it — after all, if they want to emigrate to other countries they ought to consider what life is like there and fit in with it because that is the quickest way to be accepted. The last thing you want, if you go to another country and are sane, is to make them want to throw you out or send you back where you came from. You certainly don’t go round being resolutely different, refusing to integrate and shooting up the locals.But they don’t want to fit in. Muslims want to remain who and what they are and they want you and yours to be what they are, with no compromise. In normal terms this is called an invasion but for reasons no one can understand this invasion isn’t named as such. I know we play with words and give them new meanings, but replacing ‘invasion’ with ‘refuge’ goes too far.I suspect however that if a halt had to be called it had to be done long before things went too far and got out of hand. Too late now, so we must accept that our careful, intelligent response to problems of insane religionists making war on unprotected people is to let more in and every so often wait for some more lunatic(s) to decide it is time to cull the resident population. Happily, our dear leaders are protected from this so it doesn’t matter much what happens to us peasants, does it?

        I don’t think Trump’s stated idea is impractical at all.  A temporary halt.  The US has done this over and over again.  An a halt to Islamic folks is not against their religion as much as their politics.  Islam is a meld.  It is not merely going to prayer and a mosque… the problem is thicker.  Lack of clarity and goals for assimilation are also just nuts.  For some reason the idea of bringing folks in and having them assimilate to America and our culture and fellow citizens was thrown out the window in favor of come here… live in a clustered enclave… get federal and state assistance and do your best to set yourself up as a protected class with victim status.  Too harsh?How about this…  Select all those M.E. countries and put a cap on them.  50 allowed per year for a period of 15 years.  Done.  Candidates will be selected based on their ability to work in US and prosper…  not get on the dole and fester.

        The statement from General Casey convinced me that the elite really believe this diversity crap and we follow them to our doom.  It was at that point I realized none of my sons belonged in the military despite over 100 years of military service by men in our family.
The idea of Muslim ‘refugees’ from Muslim countries is just absurd.  They’re not being persecuted for their religion, they’re just poor and unhappy and don’t like the results of their retrograde beliefs.

        The ruling elite don’t merely intend to remain in charge, they intend to reorder the world into a new feudalism with them as an aristocracy and the 99.5% of the rest as plebes.  The democratic nation state is on its way into the dustbin.  Great article.

        Is keeping sewage out of the municipal water supply going “Full Monty”, or just basic hygiene? These are the same types that demand a recall of some gizmo or food product when one in ten thousand is thought to be bad.
