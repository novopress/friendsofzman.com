        “It’s gonna be fun to watch”.  Being a “prepper” and being prepared, I didn’t realize so many others were saying the same thing.  Sort of like a universal “I told you so”.

        Found via WRSA.It’s funny, I can’t claim an “IOU” I lend to, say, my brother as an “asset” but yet a bank can…to them it’s “collateral”.

            Yes, an IOU contract that has the essential bits (identified lender, identified debtor, date of the obligation inception, any property held in trust to guarantee the debt and details, payment schedule, interest rate, penalties, and the other details) is “Commercial Paper” and is most-certainly an Asset of yours.The disadvantage you have by not being a Bank is that you cannot conjure the cash to lend from thin air. You have to lend assets that you own/control that ARE REAL.  Banks can just do bookkeeping entry (manufacturing digits = “currency”) and MAGIC- It’s a Loan!  If the bank is “honest”, they will make loans only to people they absolutely-positively-believe will move Heaven and Earth to repay the loan (honest &amp; reliable people), and will not exceed lending 10X more than the assets (not including customer deposits) of the Bank.  Any bank that dabbles in credit cards with interest rates above FedFunds +5% or in ANY kind of derivatives is juggling venomous snakes, and your deposits are at risk (FDIC is a joke, as insurance goes).  Karl Denninger proposes a next-gen banking system where every loan must be backed by an asset of the bank, at the end of each business day. If the value of an asset declines below the debt balance, someone has to cover it. 3% down house mortgages would be OVER, and a 20% down mortgage would be the riskiest type of product available. An “underwater” house just wouldn’t/couldn’t happen. House prices would go down if people had to SAVE to get into one, and the quality of lending would be immensely higher (it takes a lot of planning/work/smart-behavior to save 20% and keep it together long enough to close on a loan).Essentially, anyone above an Assistant Manager at a Branch Bank is subject to being burned alive (“necklacing” like the South Africans do to Party traitors)  as soon as the population understands what, how, why and who benefitted from their loss of everything.

        The legal status of city and state pensions greatly complicates the situation. In Illinois, for example, pensions are protected by the state constitution, and payments cannot be cut without a constitutional amendment. In others, they have a privileged contract right to state revenues.It should also be noted that our economy does not provide jobs for everyone who would like to work, and open borders immigration is increasing the demand for those jobs that do exist. Middle income people are seeing moderately declining incomes, and working class people are seeing rapidly declining incomes. The consequence is that significantly cutting payments to retired people will push them into poverty, and they will default on whatever debt they might still have. The whole cascade of secondary, tertiary, etc effects will burn through the whole economy, and will likely induce a permanent great depression.

        The feds will bail out their friends all over CA and in the urban paradises (Detroit, Chicago, NY, et. Al.) as long as they can. When that becomes impossible, the fun will start. We’re almost there. I too am 67, and I don’t know if I hope I make it to see how it turns out or would rather go ahead and croak before it all falls completely apart.

        Here in NY the math is already leaving some burn marks, with the county cutting lots of support services, cutting back on road patrol, etc., in order to make payments to the state mandated pension plan (plus build the new prison for meth and heroin addicts!) They are making heroic efforts however not to eliminate any county jobs….I’m 67, so I think…um hope…that I’ll be alive to witness the math leaving more than a burn mark. They’ll have to cut hard or inflate the currency, so it’s going to be fun.Maybe you’ve got the right attitude. It’s already a done deal so just take in the show.Tim

        The Maths are hard! So many people are math-challenged, not really sure why. My husband is forbidden from touching the checkbook. Every other time he has dared, bad math things happen and I have to hide it again. People don’t want to spend any time thinking about the things they’re not good at, it’s not fun and rarely productive. Once upon a time I found math hard until I realized that most of it is not rocket science, although the “hard math” is essential to it. Pensions are more than just math, though. To a degree they’re a sign of confidence in the future, sorta like the stock market. When things take a darker turn, math will rule the day.
