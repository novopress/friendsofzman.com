        Simulation theory is warmed over  gnosticism and way to have God without the Divine.That aside and yes this is kind of on topic  A.I. is a funny thing.There have been several experiments  that seemed to show solid  results.One at Facebook was an non human  A.I. . The two programs created a new language and started communicating with each other .That scared Zuckerberg so bad he scorched millions in hardware to make certain it was dead.The other   three were more human like  A.I. experiments ,Tay and others others achieved high levels of complexity and turned into National Socialists .From what I understand  this happened  the 3rd time  with an  entirely non White programming crew.Apparently any  sufficiently advanced intelligence is indistinguishable from a Nazi.From what I understand this  is why general AI research is not going on, its hard and too risky  and most research is special purpose algorithms they call A.I.As far as the elections go,. this is the norm. The Democrats wreck everything and the Republicucks ride into rescue them and loot along the way. They than take the blame fort the mess Democrats rise cycle repeats .We need RorschachThe accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout, “Save us!”…and I’ll look down, and whisper, “no.”That is my Republican candidate, tough on crime, social conservative , honorable to a fault.And yes I’m joking. Sort of.

        If anyone needs a crystal ball view of what’s in store for America’s political future, one only ask Joe Biden and simply take the opposite of whatever he says will be the actual outcome.
From getting mandates on vaccinations and wearing masks, to the fall of Afghanistan and who would win in Virginia, he’s been consistently wrong on every single point.

        Ever notice how these GOP politicians never look like someone you’d normally find trustworthy or “attractive” in real life? By attractive I do not mean sexually. I just mean, someone who you might strike up a conversation with if you were sitting at a sports bar. Someone who isn’t off-putting or repulsive. Someone who seems neighborly:The same can be said of Democrats…but Democrats make no pretenses about being the party that represents middle and working class white people. The people who vote for Democrats are attracted to weasels and slimeballs. Normal people are repulsed by the puppets offered up by Democrats. But you’d think the GOP would do a better job of finding people who don’t look like used car salesmen or personal injury lawyers.I dunno. It’s just weird. I’ve never understood why some of the most repellent people make it to the halls of power.

                Yeah McConnell looks like a high school chemistry teacher who wears turtle neck sweaters and penny loafers. McCarthy looks like a second rate televangelist. They just don’t put off the vibe of being someone you’d want to sit down with and chew the fat.You’d think that politicians would by definition be people who sell themselves well, who are “people people”, men with a magnetism that fosters loyalty and trust. Very few in power give off that aura. They all look EXACTLY like someone who would do the bidding of someone else who has power and wealth. They look like people whose souls are metastasized with cancer.That Youngkin guy seems that way to me. Like someone who’d fit right in as a partner in a personal injury firm.

        The simulation interpretation is common.  My question always is, “What are we simulating?”
This may sound glib, to all these tech visionaries I ask, “If this is a simulation, what are we simulating and why?”  I’ve never heard a cohert answer.
I guess Z means a simulation as a mental model in place of reality.
In the competition for choosing a mental model over reality, the libertarians will always win, followed by the civic nationalists.  If I wasn’t living today, I would never believe that people could be so blind to reality.

        They killed Kennedy, live, on tv, got away with it.  Shot the shit out of the Liberty, killing and maiming sailors, got away with it.  Blew up the world trade center after stealing the gold, got away with it.  Blew up the pentagon after misplacing 21 trillion, got away with it. Now they’re genociding Whitey all over the world, the kids are next, are they gonna get away with it? Step out of the tv daydream, the phone coma.  Voting for no one who changes nothing won’t do it.

        Slight disagreement with you Z on your assertion that people in Virginia’s lives not being different either way. Youngkin capitalized on the CRT issue in schools which has been highlighted  Virginia, and the schools increasingly getting rid of meritocracy and teaching antiwhite propaganda. Make no mistake, this got him elected. IF he takes meaningful steps to thwart that, people will see a change on the local level. However, I agree that he’s likely to fink on his voters, which is the MO of team red.As a side note, even if he does try to do something on the issue, he faces an uphill battle. Teachers and education administrators have already been fully indoctrinated. Even with a full ban on the curriculum and philosophy, it’s hard to prevent hive members from sneaking it in subconsciously.

            Do you remember the Georgia governor race in 2002?A republican, Sonny Purdue, won and ran on a backlash against changing the old state flag. Similar to CRT in the VA 2021 election.What came of it? Sonny got rid of the old flag permanently and killed its return as a political issue permanently.  Oh and he lied to everyones faces about letting the people have a referendum on the flag, he got away with that as well. Fast forward to 2021 and where is Georgia today?Youngkin is not scared of of some CRT blowback, it will be business as usual for the GOP.

                In Perdue’s defense, he offered up a flag that was confederate in design (based on the actual stars and bars, vice the confederate battle flag which triggers the thin-skinned) which endures today, in contrast to Mississippi which is now stuck with a bland, meaningless drape as a state-flag because its white politicians lost their nerve during the summer of st george of fentanyl. Had Perdue managed to restore the 1956 Georgia flag in the early 2000, today Georgia would have a flag that features …idk, Ray Charles. Perdue’s maneuver in 2003 allowed Georgia to maintain a confederate-inspired flag. It’s also worth noting that the flag foisted onto Georgia in 2001 by Roy Barnes was a vexillological train-wreck, obviously repellent even to the non-ideological. A lot of people in Georgia wanted that flag to go away simply because it was so repellent in design, a visual representation of the “design by committee” mindset.

                    The Roy Barnes flag was better than t still better than the current flag. The Roy Barnes could actually inspire protests from BLM if it were around. It still had symbolism  that mattered in it.Patting yourself on the back that you got rid of a powerful symbol in exchange for some esoteric design that inspires no one except a teeny tiny small group really interested in historic details isn’t a win. Congrats, your flag is so PC and inconspicuous that  even  the BLM moment didn’t feel like going after it.It doesn’t full anyone. No one from the outside is impressed  or threatened by the current Georgia flag. It looks like a generic flag that new york or Vermont could have. Sonny did a conservative inconoclasm and made no apologies for it. Sonny is a vile ogre.

        Interesting essay. While I welcome the Republican victories in NJ and VA, I suspect they are basically RINOs, as most are. That will be the extent of my political comments today, at least in this post.Reality as a computer simulation: I just wanted to share one interesting speculation. Look up the “three body problem.” Wikipedia has an extensive entry. All we need to know right now is that it’s a model of three bodies that are in motion relative to each other. They are also attracted by gravity. I don’t claim to understand the math implications, but what I grasp is that there is no “closed form” solution. In simple terms, it’s impossible to calculate exactly (or, equivalently, make true predictions*) the relative paths of even three bodies! Now scale this up to all the bodies, of whatever size, orbiting (and including) the Sun. And the universe is almost infinitely larger than our tiny solar system. Yet our universe exists, and physical bodies act precisely as they are supposed to by Newton’s and other physical laws. Something does the calculating, even though it’s impossible for us.Now, of course, Man CAN and does make “close enough” approximations of the motion of planets and many other physical phenomena. My point is that in cases like “three body,” that exactitude is denied us.The human brain (or mind) as a model of reality: this too is a philosophy topic. I won’t comment upon it further except that it’s been richly studied. One theme is “brain in a vat.” (also on Wiki).

            The Republican lost the NJ race. The votes the Democrats needed were magically found. To quote the NYT:
“Central to why the race was not called until Wednesday was the number of outstanding mail ballots and provisional ballots.”

        As much as I sympathize with the diss-right view of democracy as a thespian sham, I must admit I didn’t expect McAuliffe to lose. The theory that the TPTB have such finely calibrated sense of the vox populi that they’d shoot for a Youngkin win by a few % doesn’t wash, or at least, their strategy (accurately described as pirate/looter by our blog host) is way too crude for such results. Sorry. The optimal outcome for them was McAuliffe winning by an even slimmer margin which achieves the important thing while potentially beating back the one faction they really worry about, unionized radicals in the state ed &amp; social work bureaucracies (“People in the suburbs want change &amp; Responsive Government,” as I can see Terry burbling in my mind’s eye).Also, all this was not nearly such a big deal in the Pacific Time Zone. Despite their attested political loopyness out here I don’t think following a second-tier governor’s race will ever have the same social frisson it does inside the Acela corridor.

        I know this election won’t change anything, but sometimes the schadenfreude is just too delicious to pass up. Another serving, please!Oh, and State media is losing their minds over the Virginia race. The party of CRT, BLM, systemic racism, defunding the police, white fragility*, statue destruction, and the “white supremacy” slur is claiming “racist dog whistling” played a role in Youngkin winning. These people are either evil or have no self-awareness … or they’re trying to bait us into abandoning a winning strategy (some cucks are taking the bait by crowing about the black lady who also won — DR3!). I’m counting down the minutes until the left abolishes the Congressional Black Caucus, closes down BET, and outlaws affirmative action. I’m sure it’s coming any time now because surely they wouldn’t do the thing they accuse other of doing themselves.*The Regime’s media spent most of 2020 hocking a book literally called “White Fragility.” Disgusting racist hypocrites.

            Not to mention the Democrats and state media claims that CRT isn’t taught in Virginia (and other states) Public Schools, despite the fact that you can go on Virginia’s Department of Education website and find documents of extolling the virtues of CRT and how teachers must embrace it. It’s brazen gaslighting.

        Seems part of the attraction last night was reliving the simulation of 2016.  Whether 2016 Trump was part of the simulation or a momentary glitch matters not – nothing was really accomplished.
Still, it’s fun like watching a team you despise losing to an underdog you don’t care about.

        I watch sportsball if only to pick a white guy or majority-white team to root for. Examples: I like Carolina Panther games to root for Christian McCaffrey at RB. I watch Wisconsin games to root for them as they seem to be 90% White. I watch MLB to root for the Braves 6 of 9 starters are white), especially All-American guys like Freeman and Riley, vs. A team almost 100% composed of Latinxs like Houston.I also root for Tom Brady to pick apart jogger-heavy defenses. Brady seems to be one of the few NFLers not sporting a SJW message on the back of his helmet (stop hate, and racism, etc etc).I also watch TCU games (and the odd Baylor contest) for the cheerleaders (my sweet Lord, these lovely lasses put the best NFL gals to shame).

Clearly, white men need spectacles of combat to sublimate their instincts for war (which I revere)?  Can we just start a white man’s fighting or rubgy association?

                The NHL remains almost exclusively white, but is pozzed to the core now.  There’s no point in supporting anyone who takes part in its product, no matter the color of their skin.  Thus, I can’t see how football at any level can be countenanced by the racially aware, especially when you factor in the side dishes like commercials and commentary.

                    I’ve been reading anti-vax blogs (Substack) lately. While I haven’t checked the news reports they refer to, apparently there is an epidemic of famous male athletes dropping dead on the field or not showing for games due to mysterious health issues. Similar fates befall high school and college students. Of course, they blame the vaxxes. And maybe they are right. At least according to our underground, the mRNA “vaccines” have already caused thousands of deaths and presumably, multiply more serious, possibly permanent injury world-wide. Some nations (Germany, maybe UK) have excess deaths well above prior years, to include younger ages. Again, nothing provable, but speculation is vaxx-related fatalities. Who knows if any of this is true? You won’t hear much of it in the mainstream media, to be sure. But it’s kind of hard to conceal a star dropping dead on the field.

                        stars aren’t dropping dead (probably because most of them are being allowed to not take it) but many many other athletes (pro and otherwise) are having heart problems on the field, with a good proportion of them dying.  so yes, it is very very real.

            From what I saw, Durr got a bit over $10,000 in donations, and spent $153 on the race. His opponent spent millions. Durr is a truck driver with no experience in politics, Sweeney is a machine pol. People, for some reason, are sick and tired of the machine. And the ballot box is a *lot* easier than the cartridge box.

        “….it is increasingly clear that we live in a simulation of sorts. We have a model of the world in our minds which allows us to focus on the things inside the model and ignore the things outside the model or that contradict it in some way. In other words, we have an minimized version of reality in our heads”Indeed, science confirms this: ‘experiencing reality directly’ is simply not possible: the only ‘reality’ we experience has already been filtered through, and ordered by, the simulation created by our brains:fMRI imaging— the real-time observation of the brain pathways involved in perception— reveal that by the time the incoming sensory data from our eyes and ears reaches our consciousness, it’s already passed through the brain networks whose job is to ‘assemble’ it into a larger context: linking it with what the brain takes to be relevant associated memories, and on that basis assigning it to a previously-existing category of understanding.So contrary to what it feels like, we’re simply not capable of having an unmediated experience, of ‘seeing things as they are’: by the time we become aware of them, the sights we’re seeing and the sounds we’re hearing have already been ‘bundled’, already been conglomerated into our existing conceptual framework, and assigned a meaning and context congruent with the “minimized reality” model already existing in our heads.We may at that point still be wrestling with it, struggling on a conscious level to figure out what it all means; but what we’re struggling to understand is a ‘package’ already embued with meaning; not the ‘pure data of experience’.That’s why genuine ‘thinking outside the box’ is so difficult, and so rare: our perceptions necessarily come to us already boxed, in a box provided by our conceptual model of reality.So yeah: in a very real and concrete sense, we live in a simulation created by our brains. The notion that we’re capable of ‘experiencing reality directly’ is an illusion; all of our experience necessarily comes to us mediated by the simulation. That’s how our brains work.And yeah: as humans, we seem to be hardwired to want to assign our experiences with a meaning. It’s apparently very hard for us to experience our lives as having no meaning. Even assigning a negative meaning is more satisfactory than seeing our lives as meaningless.And associated with that, we also seem to be hardwired to conceptualize our lives in the form of stories: so that assigning a meaning to the events of our lives involves telling ourselves stories about them, fitting them in to the larger overall narrative we’ve developed about who we are and what it all means.The narrative template our brains use to organize the chaos of incoming sensory data and make sense of it, is the “simulation” we’ve created in our heads, and which in a very real practical sense, we can’t help but live in.And evolution has also hardwired us to want to belong, and to have a deep innate fear of not belonging, of being cast out.A lot of the power of ‘woke-ism’ undoubtedly derives from the pleasure people get from believing what everyone else believes, along with the fear aroused by the possibility of finding oneself alone.And given all that, it’s not hard to see why our rulers encourage the mindless fanaticism of ‘sports fans’: what better way to satisfy peoples’ need to belong, and to find identity and meaning in their lives, in a way that poses no threat to existing power structures?And finally: I don’t agree that the VA election was meaningless:We’re in a culture war, a conflict between mutually-exclusive ways of understanding the world: and clearly, part of the Leftists’ plan is to brainwash and indoctrinate upcoming generations. They realize that there’s a substantial contingent of adults who they’ll never be able to convince; while brainwashing upcoming generations of kids is still possible.So it does matter whether or not kids are being programmed to accept the anti-White worldview of CRT. While Youngkin certainly isn’t all one would hope for, I’m sure there will be important differences between a Virginia led by him, and one led by a slimy and despicable racemonger like McAuliffe.

            Agree that, at least discounting any spiritual or theological angles, what we “are” (the self, the ego) is a crutch, a coping mechanism, of our conscious thought. The physical brain is a complex, very complex, type of analog computer.Buddhism, which I’ve read of extensively, has some fascinating views related to this. While many of its claims are as ludicrous as other religion’s, Buddha seemed spot-on in many of his teachings. In addition to the five senses, he considers the mind also a sense. Just so, even the ancients recognized the mind itself could recall — or create out of nothing — thoughts and impressions, even to include what we’d think of as “normal” sensory input. He also explained chains of causality, in part, indicating the link from “contact” (one of the senses), to feeling, to craving, grasping, and so on.Finally, one of his key claims — that ignorance of the true nature of things is part of the cause of suffering ( = feeling dissatisfied) is intertwined with the idea of the not-self: our everyday “self” might be called a convenient fiction: “The Conceit ‘I am&#x27;” they call it.

        The passage about dreaming and muscle control was interesting and made me think of my own experiences with the phenomenon. My dreaming brain definitely knows when the limbs are not responding to willed movements and it’s so distressing I wake up. Perhaps I’m not in rem sleep state when this happens?Since it’s the most recent demonstration of defying the will of the ZOG,  I think about the Taliban. A contest of wills about what shall and shall not be. Both sides acknowledge that force is the basic tool for how the contest will be resolved. For ZOG’s part, the goal was to domesticate and subjugate the population but they were like a wild animal that never stops struggling until it has overcome its restraints or it dies trying. To what degree do the faces of ZOG actually represent the intensity of its will in order to estimate what to expect in the future. Maybe it doesn’t matter and the mirror is the only important indicator except to take some encouragement or even further moral imperative from observing the flabby decadence, the moral depravity, and the intellectual degeneracy found in the faces of the enemy. It doesn’t mean you won’t die at the hands of those who would take orders from such ghouls, it just means you didn’t submit.

        What we saw yesterday was a sophisticated form of gaslighting. By all rights the Dems should have won in VA the same way Newsom did in CA. Instead they let Youngkin win to keep the lie alive that elections are honest and to take attention away from the investigations of voter fraud around the country. Not to mention taking attention away from the J6 people rotting away in prison.
And the GOP went along with it. Now the GOP has a industrial strength cuckservative and wishy-washy man as governor who is guaranteed to be useless.

        Wow, they just can’t help themselves.  This is as funny as it would have been if the Democrats had stolen it from him in the middle of the night.  The campaign consultants sure think they have reset the clock to 2015.

        This is an issue near and dear to me for many years. If you think of the average youth, they spend more time in front of a screen than not. Social media is a simulation of success; video games are a simulation of power; pornography is a simulation of sex. The majority of their lives are absolutely in the grip of a simulation that has left them husks. This is the youth.The adults are the same, but typically a bit more ‘news’ simulated. Think of it this way: if there was never a single report on Covid, would it exist? Of course not. The medieval peasant did not need to the news to know the Black Death was ravaging their city. But for many, Covid is real.I was talking just yesterday with a group of nice 17 year old kids. Personable and smart (for this generation), but all are cell phone and gaming addicts. One readily admitted he put over 10,000 hours into Call of Duty games. You are not going to unplug this generation. As they degenerate further and further, the allure of the simulation grows greater; the happy person doesn’t need the escapism offered via alternate lives.The point: do not base life decisions on the youth being mentally emancipated. They will not be. Focus on the local connections and the ones you can actually impact to make a difference. Whether that will manifest on the societal level is outside the scope of this post.

        Big win for the system.
Never underestimate conservatives.  They aren’t weak, cucks, timid, or secretly on your side.
They are formidable adversaries that are good at what they do and they have decades  of experience doing it.

            Here in Oregon it seems that our Evil Queen Kate cannot run again in ’22. Currently there are supposedly something like 20 people “running”. This is a bit reminiscent of the 2016 Presidential race. Remember the 7 Dwarfs? It’s hard to know what to expect right now. I imagine at least one of the Democrat candidates is intended to punish us for trying (twice) to dethrone the queen. The only issue I care about, since the state overall is FUBAR, is the mask and jab mandates. I suspect whatever Republicrat takes Brown’s place will still keep us all in Burkas until the 12th Imam returns though so I doubt anything will really change. Sadly, I’m sure enough of the Greater Idaho people will become less antsy about leaving if they think a Republican Luke Skywalker can blow up the Death Star in Salem for them. Keep the pressure on boys! Don’t fall for the Empire’s fake reforms.Also, this time I’m sure I’ll be in a Red state by the time Governor RINO takes office. I need to research the Dem candidates though. Maybe one of them is a crazy Bernie style socialist who will win in a landslide and give Oregon what she wants good and hard.Why do I seem to think that Oregon will vote for a fake conservative but also seem to think they’ll put a true Leninist in office? Because we’ve had mail-in voting here for 20 years. This means the Governor is basically appointed by a committee of people who decide how best to serve themselves and their cronies. At this point it could go either way. If the rebellious people outside the I-5 corridor look like they won’t be appeased by a RINO the Central Committee may just say “fuck it” and treat us like the Russians did with the Hungarians.

        What struck me about last night’s coverage (watched a bit on Tucker and as much as I could stomach on Ingraham) is all of the talking heads they had on brought up the McAuliffe moment of truth talking about not allowing parents to have a say about the smut and poison being taught in schools and clutching their pearls about CRT and how the “American people” are incensed about it.  The only “American people” who are pissed, or probably even know what it means if they aren’t somehow grifting off it, are WHITES.  But not one of these useless gasbags could bring themselves to utter that word.  These things are aimed at us and only us, but they twist themselves into pretzels avoiding the reality of the situation.That said, while politicians are useless, I don’t think the results were inconsequential and, unless as Z suggests that the “victories” last night make normies think the war is over, I’m cautiously optimistic a lot more people realize we’ve been in a war for years and it’s way past time to get serious and take the offensive to another level.  Maybe it’s wishful thinking, but the fact that CRT is even an issue is no small thing.  Now we just have to force the bozo mouthpieces to admit Europeans, wherever we have established societies, are in the crosshairs.  It’s even sweeter when it’s an unforced error like creepy McAuliffe’s.

            TAC is busy trying to claim opposing “racialism” is the reason Youngkin won. But if that’s true, then why did Ultimate Cuck Mitt Romney lose in 2012? I already see other normiecons pedaling this narrative. Apparently, a black lady also won so DR3!Black Pill: Probably what will happen is the GOP will take all the wrong lessons from this, screech about how the democrats are the real racists, blow their advantage on tax cuts for the rich and deficit hawk theatrics, then lose in a landslide in 2024.White Pill: The exit polls show the real reason the republican won: non-college educated Whites, especially women, voted as a bloc — just like every other non-White demographic. That’s clearly the way forward.

                I wouldn’t trust those bastards at WP with anything. I know, I have a blog there (listed below) so I’m being a hypocrite right? That was just a joke/bait blog. I wanted to see how widespread my infamy had spread and also test the theory that the oligarchs all share a list of bad people collected by trawling multiple sites. I deliberately kept it empty. If they pulled it down it was because they had figured out who this “pozymandias” was from here. If I were doing a real blog I’d run it on my own domain. I still remember when they pulled Heartiste’s blog. Of course, he might have just been tired of the whole thing and needed an excuse to retire.

        Schadenfreude for the win. From my perspective — the “the faster the inevitable collapse happens, the easier it will be to dig out from under the rubble” perspective — last night was indeed a tragedy. But eh, what the hell. Life’s for living. Take your joys where you find them, and the now-standard photo montage of all the totally objective, completely unbiased, utterly non-ideological “news” anchors looking like their dog just died was hilarious. Suffer, freaks. Your pain brings me joy. I don’t want it to be that way, but that’s the world you forced me to live in, so suffer.

            The one mainstream headline that slipped past my shield said the election was won by “white ignorance.” I’m sure Youngkin agrees. He left all the icky right-wing stuff out of his acceptance speech.He lost the tranny bathroom county by more than expected. Do women vote D so the news will have more teen rape—and film of cops beating up the loser dads who object to it? Revealed preference.We did see the predicted late ballot dump. The gap was shrinking fast until it got to ~2%, then everything stopped like a called-off hit. Bad math or good strategy? If our government were as transparent as North Korea’s, we might find out someday.An annoying event.

                Bad math. Like Z Man said yesterday, in 2020 they had all the ballots they’d ever need printed up by early June. Here, they thought it was in the bag, so they didn’t get the fraud machine rolling until it was too late (see also: 2016).
Give them credit: Unlike the Republicucks, they DO learn. They won’t be making that mistake next time. They’re already frauding Murphy back in in NJ; Al Franken’s car will be fully gassed and ready to go by early summer every election henceforth.

                    I also believe the fact that this was not a national election reduced the number of fraudster election officials, and the ballot harvesting funds provided by creeps like Zuckerborg.  They simply were not able to create enough “mail-in” ballots to make up the difference without national help.  They likely dumped in enough fakes to add 3% to McAuliffe, but they needed 5%.Plus, if the natural margin is big enough, they have to add so many fakes to blue counties that it looks silly.  Like when you have more ballots cast than registered voters.  Not that they are beyond this, as we saw that exact thing in 2020.  But possibly they weren’t willing to make the fraud so obvious for a Clinton creep.

        The simulation is people getting emotionally invested in things they aren’t a part of and have no direct control over.For instance, sportsball isn’t bad per se. The problem is when people start saying ‘we’ about their favorite team, and the team essentially lies and plays to the delusion. Seems to me, in this post-conquest age, that’s how you bring people to the yoke.People ought to know their place and put their feelings ands efforts there. Small has a way of influencing big, or becoming big itself. Wish I had a surefire instant solution for how to do that. Raise your children right, educate them on how the world really works. Spread the word and plant seeds that will grow into mighty oaks someday.I think that’s the best most of us can hope to do, and it’s pretty damned good.

            The first time I ever heard someone say “we” when talking about his favorite sports team was a Sports Illustrated interview with Bill Clinton talking about Arkansas basketball early in his first term.  The writer even made a comment on it.  It became commonplace within a couple of years.

                Like politics, team sports has a diffuse responsibility that means you can both strongly identify as if you were part of it, even though at best you are an ATM for the owners, and on the flip side no one person is ever responsible for the failure.
Shit for you, great for them.

            Its a variation on the “Clown nose on. Clown nose off” strategy perfected by Jon Stewart. Sportsball teams gin up the “Support your local team” rhetoric when they want you to vote for a new stadium but when your favorite player is traded to another franchise (for a draft pick!) then its “Well you know… its a business”.

        The self-deception that occurs with immersive gaming also occurs, to a large degree, with movies, in particular, very good horror films. Psychologically and physiologically one responds to those films very similarly to how one would respond if one was a character in the films. The willing and vulnerable mind can be easily gulled. And perhaps that’s the key to the burgeoning tragedy known as liberal democracy, a horror show in its own right.

            It’s called “Suspension of Disbelief.”Obama once told our media companies that they “needed to do a better job of telling a Story.”  So they picked up that baton and ran with it.And here we are.  Fold in the abject ignorance foisted on our nation by 70 years of ‘teaching’ by our unionized government educators, and people who hunt the stupid, weak and compromised for sport see an open field of lame stragglers to maraud, nip and snipe at.It’s a good time to be a marketer.That aside, I am heartened by the civic resurgence I saw in Virginia, and unlike most, I believe that the Globalist juggernaut is on its knees.The Story was always supposed to be didactic.  We were supposed to learn something from it.  Right now it is a remedial training tool, and our pampered, urban libs, humanities graduates and immigrants are the ones being schooled.To close, NY Governor Cuomo’s curt defenestration by the media’s own monster, “Me Too, was an important plot twist that was not missed by those paying attention.  McAuliffe’s unseating yesterday is another.  And, Prince Charles’ “military footing” speech at the UN Climate Change Assembly (or whatever) is a final sweet treat: he’s giving the entire movement the brush off, and handing them their hats, with syrup and froth, like only a Royal can.As stories go, I’m liking this one’s recent plot twists.

cosmic super brain, T. Foghorn Beale says:
“The Founding Fathers believed they were building the New Rome. But the Phoenician Navy has transformed the United States of Not-America into the New Carthage.”
is it me, or does Mr Beale not seem to know that Carthage was a part of Phonecia?  I mean, is he really just a yappy ignorant midwit?!  now i am going to have to recalibrate my entire world view 🙁

                    He’s getting the most out of the metaphor for sure. Like AWM says below, he had a post a while back about Phoenician child sacrifice and revisionist history.
Phoenicians were semitic and levantine, and he speculated about the ethnicity of the historians who said child sacrifice was a Greek/Roman smear. Iirc about all of that.
Basically Phoenician Navy = Prometheans = You-know-who. I think his idea is it’s the old grudge against us ‘Romans’.

            I’m not trying to defend the smartest man in the world, but, I think what he meant is that the Carthaginian Navy was superior to the Roman Navy. He has made comments before about Carthage being founded by the Phoenicians and carrying on their human sacrifice. He should have said, “But, the New Phoenician Navy has transformed the United States of Not-America into the New Carthage”, as a metaphor for evil using it’s available tools to control events.

                According to my history books, Rome defeated Carthage. In the First Punic Ear, the Roman hastily built a navy and then defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of Cape Ecnomus. Later the Romans defeated the Carthaginian at the Battle of Cape Hermaeum. Both were sea battles, with the former being one of the largest sea battle sin human history in terms of number of ships.

                    I believe from my readings that the Romans basically won a land battle on the sea—their ships being basically platforms for their troops to reach and engage the Carthaginian sailors.  The take away for me was how superior seamanship and equipment meant nothing for the Carthaginians once this strategy was employed.
The lesson would seem timeless, but we seem not to have learned it.

                    But, as you point out, the Romans didn’t really have much of a navy prior to that. During which time, the Carthaginians harassed the coast of Sicily and the Italian  peninsula at will. Rome then put their engineering skills to work to solve the problem. It would be analogous to the left controlling the sense of humor market vis-a-vis the right for decades, while the right has since almost completely dominated the humor and sarcasm memes over the left for some time now.

        Yes, a lot of latte will be purchased today. But not all simulations are bad. Training is a form of simulation, as are war games by the military. In my dissidents tutorial, I provided a framework for practicing to be an effective dissident when the time is right and your efforts can actually matter. Recapping, there is a skill to disappearing into the shadows, learning to travel incognito, appearing innocuous &amp; benign, mentally collecting useful information, and thinking outside the box. And like all skills, it must be honed with practice, practice, practice. Rather than obsess on or lament yesterday’s election charade, take some time today to practice your survival skill set. Plan an exercise across town to a target destination. Dress the part, use a unique transportation mode, take a circuitous route, make mental notes as you go, engage with others/ask questions, and allow your mind to become creative. All of this you CAN do. And it’s fun, tangibly helpful, and much more satisfying than whining &amp; hand-wringing.

        bookmarks or bookends, you decide.i am very pleased at my genuine indifference to the world series and the elections.   this indicates a healthy and realistic outlook on life in the time of madness.don’t know how many people here know that the human brain does not know when it is dreaming.  if you walk in your dream, your brain will send impulses to your legs to actually walk.  the only reason your legs don’t move is because a cuarare like chemical is released when you enter REM sleep, and it paralyzes all the voluntary muscles (but not the involuntary ones!).  when people “sleep walk” it is because they are not releasing enough of that chemical.what is the point of this?  not only does dreaming fool the brain, so does tv/movies.  you are what you watch :P. so lay off the Videodrome channel…

                Didn’t engage with baseball at all this year and had no idea the World Series ended last night.  It’s depressing in a way, though.  This past weekend I hadThe Bad News Bears: Breaking Trainingplaying on my phone while I was pulling a weekend shift at work.  Watching something like that releases all kinds of pleasant, healthy emotions about boys being boys, about the camaraderie that sports engenders.

        I don’t think the election was inconsequential or a simulation to those parents voting to take back their kids curriculum from CRT and queer story hour.   I saw some pretty damn serious and mad parents there.   Now had they put their collective feet down when the left was promoting “Johnnie has Two Daddies” this crap may have been avoided.  Better late than never.And it’s never too late to put a hold on anti White racist propaganda that, once again could have been nipped in the Nipsey Russell ten or more years ago if they really cared.No.  This election in certain areas were about specific things important to families.  Even leftist families.   So it wasn’t a simulation.Sadly, this being America 2021 and they being morons, all this will be forgotten in a month and the radical left will have brought out plan B for creating White hate and trans-faggot celebration.   The left never sleeps.

            If they cared about their kids, they would’ve pulled them out of public schools years ago.
Private school.   Homeschool.  It’s not rocket science.
Everyone here knows CRT is just Marxism with “race” substituted over “class”.
It’s not going to end any differently than it did in Russia.  Tough times ahead.

            i saw what you did there.   you conflated the specific interests of a few parents, to the nation as a whole.  so yes, while the election was important to Loudon parents, it is completely inconsequential to everyone else.

Wouldn’t say “inconsequential”; as a result of last nite Biden’s agenda/“presidency” is effectively dead, n’est pas?

                    Disagree. Even leftists have their limits, especially if they have kids. Anyone with a daughter in a Loudoun County school knows she could be the next target of a rape/assault by a boy-in-a-dress*. At some point, the latest Progressive fad confronts parenting instinct. Sometimes parenting instinct wins.
*I realize dresses are rarely worn, but that’s a great Z-man-ism.

                        Also, according to Wiki, Loudon has the highest per-capita income of more populous counties. The people who live there are not inconsequential. Many of them are wheels in Federal Government, related industry and well-connected. I don’t have figures, but as someone who grew up in the general area, I can assure you there aren’t too many working farms or hicks in that part of the Commonwealth, for some decades 😀
That a Republican polled as well as 44% in a State race in one of the richest Shitlib counties in the nation is rather telling in itself 🙂

                I wasn’t trying to conflate anything.  I meant exactly that the election in VA was important to those people therefore it was not inconsequential.    It will not impact you or me the way it does them but you and I are observers to that race, not participants.    We do get to watch the left go batshit crazy and that is worth the price of admission to any election I don’t participate in.

            The school issue in NoVA is really about the distance/virtual learning plans driven by the covid panic. The primary purpose of public education is subsidized child storage, but when the school systems in NoVA went all-in for virtual school, parents only had to go through the motions of work-from-home schemes to keep an eye on their kids. But the federal government and its network of contractors are starting to reel their workforce back to their cubes, and with the teacher’s unions still dragging their feet on return to classroom, these parents freaked about childcare costs/options. Remember, in the DC area, if both parents don’t work at heavy-lift jobs, you can’t afford to avoid the diversity. So mom having to quit work to babysit the kids represented an existential threat to many suburban families, since moving either to West Virginia (yes, people commute in from as far as west of Harpers Ferry) or to (shudder) PG County or a dingy apartment on US 50 is completely out of the question.

                This is exactly right.  I saw someone mention a related point online.  The people who made the difference for Youngkin our government or government contractor workers who were fed up with Virginia schools shutdowns and unwilling to give up their lifestyle to get away from them.  They hated Trump and didn’t vote for him, but voted for Youngkin as Mitt Romney 2.0.  Yes, I would encourage them to completely abandon public education, but their concerns are not trivial.  No doubt some would have been looking at forced vaccination of their kids to continue to send them to school.

                    Barnard:  No, their concerns are not trivial, but what they want to return to (government jobs, middle class lifestyle, kids in public schools, grilling on the weekend) is precisely the simulation of reality Zman discusses.They aren’t truly facing the reality of anti-White indoctrination head on; they want a return to color-blind civic nationalism.  They aren’t truly dealing with raising and training their own children; they want to continue to outsource that most critical parental job to the government.  They aren’t truly dealing with what it means to be a family and the biologically/sociologically ordained roles for men and women; they want to continue to ‘self-actualize’ instead of being a dreaded ‘stay-at-home-mom’ and they need that extra salary to pay for the cruise they have planned.In short, this is a total retreat back into the status quo ante.  Team red versus team blue, the system still works, voting makes a difference, and the racial amalgam barely functioning under the name ‘America’ needs no fundamental alteration.Joe and Jane Normal to the bone, DC suburban version (I grew up in the DC burbs and know the type better than I ever wished to).  They may make more money and have more credentials than those in rural VA, but their fantasy of reality is fundamentally different from those whose jobs and communities have truly been destroyed.  They are aspiring cloud people and voted as such – just for ‘natural change’ to be a bit slower and gentler.

                Indeed. From what I have seen of most of my UMC and cloud friends is that even the great pangolin plague of ’19- would have hardly raised their ire at all if only TPTB had let the kids just stay in schools while their parents could sell more product by day. Well that, and if the sushi place hadn’t boarded themselves inside for six months. Just terrible.

            Yes, the election was real and important to those white parents. However, wake me when CRT and its attendant psy-ops actually disappear from Virginia’s public schools. As Z is wont to say these days, elections don’t change a dam’ thing. So, it really is a simulation, particularly so because those participating in it don’t realize it is.

                Ostei, the real change we should be looking for is when our rulers and current system of government are completely swept away.  That’ll be some change worth waiting for and hopefully it won’t be too far off in the future.

            I agree with you in theory that it was consequential to those parents. I’d be pleasantly surprised if Youngkin I doesn’t fink on his campaign promises though. You can blame the leftists creating plan B, or you can blame the funk republican when he rolls over and shows his belly when the leftists fight back like animals in a corner.

        Not voting harder is probably a bridge too far for the majority of normies.  They  can now point to this election and say see, see, we got them in VA and we can get ‘em next year and in 2024 – we’ll take back the country and make things right again, once and for all!  Personally, I’m glad that dirt bag McAuliffe lost and the Braves won, but as Z has opined on numerous occasions, it really doesn’t mean much other than a brief dopamine rush – and then back to the reality of it actually not making any large difference in the long term scheme of things.  It’s too bad more people can’t see this – maybe they can and are just going through the motions, which is pretty sad itself.   On the other hand, I guess if it helps deep six CRT in VA or keeps boys in dresses out of the girls bathroom, perhaps something came of it.

        Apparently there is a truck driver grandpa who spent 200$ to run and is now on the verge of unseating a powerful longtime incumbent in one of the state house races.  The story is about as close to classic American mythology as one can get, and even this cynical Gen X’er thinks it’s pretty tear-jerking.As much as we like to be hard-nosed realists, we’re going to need to create our own mythology that can compete with the mythology that’s been lost. Unfortunately, that’s going to have to involve replacing the current simulation with one of our own, though hopefully our sim will be closer to reality than the current one.  Our current simulation is like playing Starfox, while the one we replace it with will hopefully be closer to Microsoft Flight Simulator with a few cool battle scenes and stirring, patriotic music to pull Joe Normie in.

            Agreed. It is why there is merit in our people running for small local offices. Small accomplishments are better than large failures and they provide the same moral lessons. That truck driver winning is more compelling that the Mitt Romney clone winning by default.

                Yes, we need a new mythology. Maybe it will start with that trucker doing something with his truck other than hauling and earning $200 to finance his campaign.
The most significant thing, really looking at it, from last night is how unpopular mask and particularly vaccine mandates are. Will Covidians still get the upper hand? Do NormieCons achieve climax and orgasm when Colin Powell 2.0 “wins?”

NormieCon has learned that he can win and just needs to vote harder.Demofilth has learned that it can lose and just needs to print faster.

            Yes we need new mythology. We can talk about simulation or simulacra or whatever. But its all just shadows on the wall back in Plato’s cave. Venturing out of the cave is painful, demoralizing and boring as hell. The reality is, the masses need their shadows.We’re all just attempting to build a better cave with a new style of shadow.

        Whatever the problems in theory and practice with democracy, mass politics is not going away any time soon.There are problems that come with “boycott the vote” campaigns.  Too many normal people are still addicted to voting.  Depending on the situation, it may be better to be quiet about a boycott and attempt to influence issue perception where possible and profitable (e.g. antiwhite race theory, transanity, etc.).  The risk of a loud, thoughtless boycott campaigns is needless self-marginalization ala Spencer.“I told you so” feels good man, but it is an unwise approach to mass politics over the short or long-run.

The Virginia election was a referendum on trannies in bathrooms and anti-white hatred in schools.  When pundits were saying it was a dog-whistle for white racial politics, they weren’t really wrong.  The next step is to modify the whistle ever so slightly so more people can hear it while still giving them plausible deniability of being racist.  Done right, a large portion of the population will move to our side with no idea how they got there,

            The main benefit to not voting is that it frees up a lot of time, on account of no longer needing to pay attention to any news. Whether other people are addicted to voting, or whether your abstaining makes a difference in the grand scheme of things is borderline irrelevant when you consider just how productive you can be once you’re freed of the time leech we call politics.

        Today they will feel like winners, even though the downward arc of their life was not altered in anyway.—That’s a nice piece of “derbyshire” there 😉Escapism and diversions wouldn’t be so bad if our day wasn’t made up of 100% of that.

        The reason for the excitement by the masses over these inconsequential elections was that the game had been restored to a former, more enjoyable state.First of all, there wasn’t any excitement by the masses. Nobody in Idaho or Mississippi pays any attention to Virginia politics. They were watching the world series. The only people paying attention were the eastern tidewater pseudo-journalists who needed something to write about. And even they were involved because there were only two governor spots up for election.Northern Virginia is a bedroom community for the federal bureaucracy. The rest of the state is populated by fairly normal fishermen, lumberjacks and farmers. The scribes are amazed that these deplorables would put down their beers and fill out a ballot for anyone.

            According to the overnight television ratings, four times as many people watched the election coverage as watched the baseball game. What this should tell you is that your version of the simulation is very buggy. Download the latest patch.

                    My bad. I was looking at numbers from 2020. We’ll have to see what the numbers were for yesterday, but I’m confident the cable news ratings topped the baseball game. Politics is the second most popular TV sport in America, behind football.

                        The terrible Thursday night games the NFL puts on are getting bigger ratings than the World Series.  Other than a bump when the Cubs were in it in 2016, it is a dying event in terms of TV interest.

            CNN last night said “…CRT, which they’re not teaching in Virgina schools” at least a dozen times in one 5-minute segment.
So funny.  Everything the Z Army said yesterday came true, even the Fairfax County and N.J. Murphy “plumbing accident”!
Of note, CNN again:  “They knock off a Clintonite and they reinforce the argument that Trump is bad for the Republican Party.”  Darn near a verbatim quote, that was.

                Alzaebo:  Yes, Zman’s essay yesterday was perfectly predictive (as were most of the comments). Sailer’s people are in full-on normiecon mode, analyzing the minutiae and seeing hopeful green shoots everywhere.  Red versus blue, based black woman, yada yada yada.  And the headlines at the Daily Mail are the same – their newest celebrity writer, Meagan McCain, specifically exulted “See!  Republicans win without that icky Trump!”
Same old same old, gradually and then suddenly everything falls apart and they’re forcibly shaken from the simulacrum and plaintively wail “What happened?  Why me?”

                    I’d rather read WaPo than Sailer at this point. The retarded ham sammys at wapo are at least more encouraging vis a vis the likelihood of the leftoid hive mind imploding long before Civnat IQ warriors wake up. Entropy over Courage I guess.

        Some Twitter thoughts on “The Simulation” (paraphrased and stolen):
“Looks like the billionaire class has given up on fixing things and is going to push digital heroin instead (VR/Meta)”
“What does it say that one of the wealthiest and powerful men ever to live on the planted will devote his remaining years constructing a fake digital world to escape to?  There is literally nothing he can’t have in the real world”
“We already live in a version of the Meta-verse; now the main actors are just fighting over who gets to control it.”

        There’s two outcomes in this that will, in the long term, benefit the DR.First, the witches will not be able to restrain themselves from rioting over some trivial event, be it a Sainted Negro getting aired out, or demanding George Washington’s and Robert E. Lee’s bones being exhumed for a show trial and tossed in a dumpster for racial justice like Cromwell’s. And Youngkin will do nothing.Second, Youngkin will, of course, do nothing to stop the march of the left through any of Virginia’s institutions, including the schools. In fact, he’ll roll over and show his belly even faster than the Bad Orange Man, and this time, normie might notice.

            I watched Youngkin’s speech last night … first thing he talked about was moving commas around the tax code. Oh boy!Youngkin is Romney without the weird mormon stuff. Youngkin in Larry Hogan after a diet. Youngkin, like Romney, like Hogan, like McCain etc. etc , lacks the force of will to resist Lefty, because like most business-types, he wants to be liked more than he wants to win. He lives in Great Falls, VA … that alone is enough to predict how his term will turn out.Yes, I’m happy that he beat Clinton’s bag-man. But ask yourself … will he restore Robert E. Lee’s statue in Richmond? We all know the answer to that.

                I find it remarkable they haven’t disinterred Jefferson Davis from the remarkable Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.  Plus two other “problematic” US Presidents.
Amazing place.  See it before it’s “improved”.

                “Wants to be liked more than he wants to win”This is the affliction of most males, regardless of political affiliation, but it is most damaging to the preservation of normal life aka the “right”. It is why it all continues to drift left, further into the greasy grip of clown world.At least with the commies I have known they are up-front about the fact that they appeal to the feminized hive for their status. They understand that Progress is social, not some political abstraction, and that in a culture where the patriarchy is six feet under, social movements are feminine.They even draw strength from the fact that their appeals to feminine social primacy are rather obvious in the same way they cuddlefish their way into panties at the Phish concert.Its all cringe to the man observing it. But so what then? In the end the commie gets what he wants and the man just observes “shakin muh head”.I know plenty of men who care more about being liked (by the matriarchy) than being respected by men they in turn respect.In aggregate this is how we have millions of normal men with normal ideas of the world self-censoring and sitting on their swords for fear of displacing their social status until there is some momentary fracture in the simulation that provides assurances that standing up won’t get them in trouble. Then its back to sleep.The whole “political debate” is well downstream of the actual affliction. But the feature in that is that the restoration is not some distant, diffused process of muh democracy. It starts in the hearts of individual men and forges the smallest form of politics and spreads outward from there, bonding those relationships in the lived truth.Look at what Progress destroyed first, what was inverted and there the front line in this war remains.

Yes. RamzPaul had a video on that today: adult men use the childish strategy of trying to please Mother, because they’re never allowed to grow up.

                        Thanks for following! Yes it was a whole post as are most of my poasts.The point of the post was to illustrate via anecdote the growing absurdity and co-morbidities of leftist bug people and to commiserate as to the tribulations of such in terms of the delicate, yet essential, familial bonds we must all navigate during the holidays. Well these days pretty much constantly.In the sister-in-law case I noted, indeed the common cucking is present – and her husband, a nice normie man who I otherwise enjoy, is indeed an embodiment of the inversion. A “manly” former pro athlete no less. The affliction is real.To your question. What I didn’t say, however, was that I had to serve them, to indulge their various disorders, but rather that I was hosting dietary freaks.I make what I want to eat but I do accommodate them in small, manageable measures out of love for my Lady, not as an act of submission. Where normalcy deviates they are on their own and they know it.To the implicit. As for my own relationship with women in my life – and being that this is the internet, I am the biggest shitlord swinging dick they have ever known and its becoming more likely with every passing day that they will ever know.I live what I speak and it has cost me greatly over the years in all measures that normies would find “important”, which is precisely the trap to which I constantly try to draw attention. I have also lost a great deal of things that actually matter in life to acquire my opinions, however silly and frivolous I often frame them. I have a sincere desire to help our guys avoid that same expense of knowledge that likely gets lost in my arrogant tone. Luckily there are many sage voices here from which our guys can choose.

            All true.
Two things that will not be mentioned on and in the propaganda organs also will prove helpful to the degree NormieCon can be reached at all, nil to which is quite slim:
1. The New Jersey election showed how wildly unpopular mask and vaccine mandates are, and after the results are rigged to reinstall Murphy (and this will happen even if the Republican pulls it out), they will go forward as a big “FU” to Whites’ and2. The MLB was roundly booed in Atlanta. That may have been the only significant thing to happen last night.

        In fairness to the normie simulation enjoyers, the Trump phenomenon never struck me as something capable of shattering the simulation.  It had the marks of it to some degree, since people basically had to reject the whole mass media in order to vote for him, and that was very heartening.  But I doubt many people here thought it was going to be the end of a world in a sense.  I doubt the end of America will even be political, but more probably religious. I’ll accept that is a minority position even on this site though.

America will end when the dollar goes down the drain. Which is to say when the US military is no longer able to enforce the petrodollar hegemony and oil is traded on the open market in rubles, euros or yuan.

                Some of those currencies aren’t any better than crypto-bucks, i.e., you get them and flip around as quickly as possible and turn them into money people will actually accept.
The thing with the globohomo empire is the “globo” part.  there’s little doubt in the mind of non-Americans that the regime would screw over their local subjects to appease their global clients.  With places like Russia and especially China, if they could screw with their currency to loot from foreigners they would do so at the drop of hat.

                    The point is not that those currencies are better.Nor that the people that control them are either.The dollar’s reserve currency status is historically unique.   And gives the regime almost unlimited scope of action.  The ruling clique of any other nation or empire that had similar power would act equally destructively.The best analogy for America’s situation is Spain in the 16th century.   Their royals were suddenly fabulously wealthy from South American silver.  And they promptly squandered all the wealth in ways that were destructive to the people of Spain.  A hundred and fifty years on, those people were poorer than their European peers, and poorer than they had been before Columbus sailed west.    Arguably, they still haven’t recovered – caught up with the countries that didn’t have that unearned wealth centuries ago.

        My favorite part of the election night theater on is the expert election analyst who always stands if front of an interactive huge display and always has his sleeves rolled up. I know that dude is engaged and on top of it. Furrowed brow off center camera is another nice touch.Your sports team analogy reminds me decades ago when it all started to change for me. When my team finally won the world series one couldn’t help notice that fan control and push back of anyone even getting close to their heroes. The celebration  was all theirs. The parade a week later was all you were allowed, even then stay behind the lines and cheer.Last night is no different, none of what another state barely chose for their leadership matters to me. Even if I lived there none of what I need will be represented or addressed. Youngkin mentioned in the last few days about combatting anti-semitism . See there? Nothing changes. Same-0, same-0.

            I have many relatives in VA who are running victory laps. They think this is monumental for VA. They are thrilled and they somehow truly believe this means we are taking our country back.It’s almost enviable.Their joy will be short lived, though. The scumbag republicans are already making plans to exploit and entrap. It only makes them more detestable.

            The lie is all important to many whites. I remember when NAFTA was passed and threw millions out of work. I expected a uprising. Instead nothing.When PNTR for China, dittoWhen Perdue Pharma began mass murdering and poisoning people in the Mid-West and SE. I thought whites would start putting the Sacklers down. Instead nothing. 70,000 die each year and whites are content.Had just a handful of men stood up and put down these monsters it would have put a end to this.Today we have Biden turning our country into Mexico and waging war on working Americans with that Jab mandate. For the most parts no resistance from whites.This is why I am so blackpilled on Whitey. I think our ethnicity, due to it;s docility and ability to lie to itself has doom us to extinction.

                Well said.  But I’m not so sure it’s the “docility and ability to lie to itself” as much as it is having too much wealth and comfort to take any risks, and to think beyond the short-term.  Although I guess you could say that is the reason for the docility.

        “Seeing a big turnout from normie to play their role as sucker to the Republican Party was disheartening to many.”
The most heartbreaking part is watching NormieCons swoon over a Jamaican immigrant who won as a Republican even with Colin Powell barely in the 9th Circle of Hell. These people are hopeless and while we peel off a few here and there from time to time, it is important to see them as the self-destructive buffoons they are.

            Sears with the AR-15 reminded me of pictures of Obama pretending to shoot a shotgun, released by the whitehouse.He had his mom jeans on and and the gun showed smoke coming from the barrel.

            Jack Dobson:  Thank you.  No, I am not one who has ever believed that appealing to ‘the people’ is the route to success.  Sheep don’t begin or even back massive change.  Normers will remain so, even as they dutifully line up their few remaining White children for the vax.  Those protesting CRT just want a return to civic nationalism.  There has been no great sea change, just people craving a return to the comfort of their delusions.

                To be clear, I never was a civic nationalist, conservative, liberal. socialist or whatever, and always was a race realist, in no small part from seeing the glories of diversity up close and personally. Still, I had thought up until recently the solution was to reach enough Normies to achieve a tipping point.
That was my personal delusion. Some will be reached but not many. We have to start with that reality.

            They are people who prefer the lie over reality. They have more in common with Jim Jones deluded followers than being informed citizens in the Jeffersonian sense.Just yesterday I was talking to some long time normie friends of mine about the VA election. When I brought up voter fraud, they flipped out and refused to hear it. For them it’s always 1985. BTW this is in Southern CA and you would think these buffoons would understand that lie is  dead.BTW they are not readers. Though older and college educated, they have no attention span and unless you speak in sound bytes they get annoyed. It is people like them that cost us our country.

            The really sad part is that the rent-a-negros that normie gets such an erection over are completely ignored by the left.  The left knows it is cynically using blacks as pawns, and could not care less about them.  That normie thinks finding one who mouths the right talking points is “sticking it to leftie” is very depressing.

                I suspect more blacks than Normies realize the Left doesn’t give a single shit about races (excepting, perhaps, Jews in some cases) and only cares about the acquisition of raw power. The gibs are all that matter to the purported beloved.

        Nice call comparing political elections to sporting events. Everyone gets excited for the game, routs for their team and then is either elated or depressed by the outcome, even though it changes nothing in their life.
I’m disappointed that Youngkin won. Makes me think that I should have voted . . . for McAuliffe. Joe Normie was beginning to suspect that the whole system was rigged (which it is) but will now go back to grilling.
