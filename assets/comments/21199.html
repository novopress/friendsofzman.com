        The fundamental problem is that the ruling class does not view itself as a steward of America.  To them America is just another territory to be harvested, like the Ukraine or (they hoped) China.  So using the Color Revolution playbook internally is perfectly natural.https://www.revolver.news/2020/09/meet-norm-eisen-legal-hatchet-man-and-central-operative-in-the-color-revolution-against-president-trump/

            To them America is just another territory to be harvestedIt is harvesters all the way down. This is a mindset that I believe indeed applies not to just those at the top, but many in the middle and many at the bottom.Furthermore, it is always worth looking at a handful of your largest companies and figuring out where the loyalties of these entities lie. There did use to be many companies who were pro-America, or UK, or Australia. Of course, once the cheap labour comes in, once the lucrative trade deals with foreign territories arrive, this rhetoric is hollow.To me, it is the same problem of scale that any community eventually has to deal with ‚Äì be it a village, a business, a political group, gun club, or whatever you fancy. It is also exactly why any attempt to reform the system will always be a failure. The uppers of society are not linked in any way to the middle and the lowers. Before the massive diversification of the West, perhaps an appeal could have been made to ‚Äòshared history‚Äô or ‚Äòcommon values‚Äô or something else with a mystical appeal‚Ä¶ but now?On a scale of 1 to 10, how much does it wind you up when, say, Satya Nadella mentions ‚Äòour values as a nation‚Äô or Kamala Harris says something like ‚ÄòThat is not who we are‚Äô. This is why it can be an infuriating process speaking to normal people, who still think all of this can work.

            That‚Äôs because elite religion is satanic garbageKabbalists see God as an energy waiting to be tapped into, utilizing magical words. That‚Äôs why new age people invoke energy &amp; universe power instead of saying God.The elites have the same philosophy in regards to America, they use propaganda(magic words) to mold the country as they wish.

                Magic Words and magic images (TV). And (encouraged) if the public must think, please use Magical Thinking!  I saw the image of a video (but declined to watch) Kenosha ‚Äúvictim‚Äù Jacob Blake in his hospital bed. I‚Äôm glad the young man is alive, but we all know what the story will be (the details aren‚Äôt even important!): poor young black man gunned down by the police, now (I assume) paralyzed. Scant to no mention of WHY he was shot at: his criminal past, serious pending criminal charges, Blake‚Äôs conduct that brough him to his current state. No, the implied, sometimes they have the audacity to openly say, here is another victim of police who have nothing better to do than use poor innocent Black men as target practice. üôÅ

                It‚Äôs not hard. Conservatives are just imbeciles who lack any ability to strategize. Step 1: exploit the AOCs of the world to dramatically raise their taxes Step 2: destroy inner cities with section 8 housing and property tax increases, which will drive richies out of places like Manhattan Step 3: larp as a leftist and demand White cities like Portland and Seattle experience mass immigration and diversity because muh White privilege Step 4: support making white flight out of left-wing areas a hate crime Step 5: increase the capital gains tax Step 6: abolish the police in left-wing cities ‚Ä¶. there are lots of ways to make them pay. This isn‚Äôt hard.

            So you‚Äôre saying that a political entity whose origin was as a colony of a foreign power and was viewed by it‚Äôs settlers as a satellite of another nation may not have developed strong national roots? /sarcasmIn all seriousness, America is not and never has been a nation. There never was at any point in the geographical area now known as the United States a single cohesive ethnicity. The area has always been populated by diverse societies and cultures, so it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that a strong national has never formed here. Even among the whites that settled here, there are three basic types: people trying to escape genocide or oppression, utopians, and exploitative capitalists. There‚Äôs no reconciling these groups, and therefore no uniting them in a cohesive group identity. Nationalist politics simply don‚Äôt apply to America.

                Read Albion‚Äôs Seed. You can make the case that America‚Äôs founding mythologies are false in some if not many ways but the folkways of its people are pretty evident regardless.American identity since at least the Revolution has been distinct from British and European identity in general. As Anatoly Karlin recently pointed out to me at Unz, Russians are more like Americans than Western Europeans.  He knows what Americans are, for better or worse.  We may not like everything about the identity, but it exists.The fact that our identity is being attacked and diluted doesn‚Äôt render it voidab initio. You‚Äôre going too far with this take.

                    American culturs may be easily distinguished from British and European cultures, but that doesn‚Äôt prove there is one unifying American culture. For example, bluegrass music is distinctly American (or at least non-European), but it is definitely looked down upon by a huge number of Americans. The closest thing to a universal American cultural  touchstone is a disdain for European things, but my point that there is not a unified culture remains. You can‚Äôt get Americans to agree on a single positive thing. See how divided people are over foreign policy, environmental policy, gay marriage, etc. You can‚Äôt build a nationalist polity with people who irreconcilably disagree about the most things. And it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that this is this case because there was no unity of purpose among the initial and subsequent migrants.

                        Drew you‚Äôre completely disregarding how unified the country was in the past.  The inflection points were the Civil War and the post-WWII era (particularly in the 60‚Äôs) but even as of 1963 this was a very unified country that agreed on most things.  The Democrats and Republicans prior to that point mostly argued over tax &amp; labor policy as well as foreign policy.  Most of what we call ‚Äúsocial issues‚Äù today weren‚Äôt on the table until after WWII.

                            The country we know today didn‚Äôt exist until 1959, when Alaska and Hawaii became states. The Democrats didn‚Äôt exist until well into the 19th century, and violent infighting and insurrections incurred in Washington‚Äôs administration. The United States have rarely been completely unified and peaceful. I suggest you read a lot more history, because it takes a tremendous amount of ignorance to suggest the US has had a tranquil union for most of it‚Äôs history.

Puhleze. Political entity =/= country itself. The overwhelming majority of the population lived outside of those states. The overwhelming majority of the history and culture of this country came long before those states were a thing. Did the English people cease to exist after the British Empire fell?

                                ‚ÄúTranquil‚Äù and ‚Äúwithout identity‚Äù are not the same thing.
Alaska and Hawaii have never had any meaningful impact on American identity or nationalism.

                                As I said, perhaps not the most flattering example but one I just happened to watch at the moment, and one that‚Äôs instantly, unmistakably American. And not just by the peculiar sense of aesthetics, but by the uncompromising respect for individual freedoms and differences.The witnesses ‚Äì like the sheriff and the guy that made the King‚Äôs videos ‚Äì might think all these people are crazy, perhaps dangerously so, but hey, what can you do, right?

                To an extent, I agree.  The entire ‚Äúnational territory‚Äù of the continental US was likely never really one single cohesive nation, as even the unfortunate war of northern aggression showed.  The best we could have hoped for was the original articles of confederation and perpetual union, although the latter part of that title itself would lead to problems.  Interestingly, as one history site explainsDuring the early years of the [revolutionary] war this desire [a government powerful enough to defeat Great Britain] became a belief that the new nation must have a constitutional order appropriate to its republican character. A fear of central authority inhibited the creation of such a government, and widely shared political theory held that a republic could not adequately serve a large nation such as the United States. The legislators of a large republic would be unable to remain in touch with the people they represented, and the republic would inevitably degenerate into a tyranny.And now, here we are.  Balkanization is probably best, and restoring freedom of association is a potentially bloodless way to get there.  I applaud that group of black families staking out their own town, and may a thousand such towns for each ethnicity bloom.

            They‚Äôre a foreign derived elite which builds consensus through promoting hate among minorities against Whites. Increasingly, this is true in a literal sense. Thus, foreigners like Trevor Noah, Jim Jefferies, and Jonathan Oliver spew racial hatred against Americans from their ‚ÄúComedy‚Äù Central perches on a near daily basis, heavily promoted by social media.Think of it this way. If you moved to Japan and got really wealthy and then a war occurred with China, what‚Äôs it to you? Those aren‚Äôt your people. Would you really want to sign up and get killed or sacrifice your kids? Certainly not. Our foreign ruling class sees America in the same way. It‚Äôs a resource for self-advancement, not a common community one would have any true loyalty to.

        The people in charge do not care.  They do not live among us.  They live in faraway places, connected by private plane flights.  There is an entire network of airports, terminals, planes, pilots, and charters that is invisible to the rest of us.  Along with far off islands and obscure inlets.  They dwell there.  It‚Äôs like a network of limos to gated mansions, when the rest of us get to ride Greyhound buses to the tenements.As long as the rest of us don‚Äôt get hold of the nukes, they are happy to let us tear ourselves apart.  One can not comprehend what it is like to have more wealth than Croesus.  It changes one‚Äôs life, and one has only two things left to do, which is to decide how to spend one‚Äôs days, and how to avoid death.The vast art collections are playthings, like a baseball card collection is to a kid.  Some, like Bill Gates, go all in on vaccines.  Or it might be birth control, or third world water well projects.  Maybe buy a pro sports franchise.  Others get their jollies the Soros way, by stirring social pots and watching cultures squirm.  Soros really was the kid who would fry ants with a magnifying glass.At the end of the day, they are as happy or unhappy as any of the rest of us might be, but with a twist.  They have no excuse for their unhappiness, having been born or having found themselves rounding third base for home, with no ball in sight.  So any despondency they feel (which is a normal part of human existence) is expressed in particularly strange ways.  It is their world, and we just happen to live in it, as they see it.  And we are darn ungrateful to them for their indulgence in letting us exist, as far as they are concerned.The rest of us, from their perspective, are simply the rats in the maze (the maze they are not a part of) getting up in each other‚Äôs faces.  They couldn‚Äôt care less.  If the rats can‚Äôt get along, withhold the rat food.

            Well written. While being filthy rich is a prolem may of us would gladly try üôÇ you hint at, but don‚Äôt deny that wealth itself can be a problem. When all your material wants are taken care of, what more do you need? Actually deciding what to do with your time (and wealth) can become all-consuming. While we won‚Äôt agree on many of their intended or achieved ends, at least some ot the rich try to put their money to work. But, I give more credit to an older time, when Carnegies built libraries. Today, we get sketchy vaccinne programs or birth control intiatives for populations who are immune to such an idea, or worse, Soros pot-stirring. It‚Äôs not an original idea, but if you have good health, enough food, shelter, and some people who love you (and vice versa), anything more than that is mostly baggage.

                Having retired at fifty with enough money to never have to worry about money, I can tell you that it isn‚Äôt as great as I imagined.  I experienced a bit of an existential crisis when the kids were all off to college and on their own.  None of my friends are retired and therefore most of my many hobbies and interests are indulged alone.  If I had it to do over, I would have continued working simply for the social connection and semblance of purpose.

        What the Left offers them is reassurance.And, critically, a Cause, something higher to fight for than mere creature comforts; existential meaning. A better world. If they just wanted reassurance, they could pay a Freudian snake charmer to blow smoke up their thermal exhaust ports.Not to put too fine a point on it, but what if the protesters got their wish and the cops were not only pulled off the streets, but they were disbanded?They don‚Äôt want the cops pulled off the streets per se, they want them replaced with SJW commissars ‚Äì and they‚Äôre succeeding: because who is going to take up the guns of all those cops now leaving the corps in disgust? Trumpentroopers? I don‚Äôt think so.

            Well done, Felix. It has the ring of truth. The main flaw in neoliberalism is that it deprives the adherents of meaning and purpose. It has tries to undermine the family, the community and the nation‚Ä¶ not understanding that if they succeed, they are wide open to any hostiles capable of any kind of tribalism. Right now, the White people in the Donk party have abdicated‚Ä¶ and now the tribes fight amongst themselves for control. It‚Äôs hilarious: the food fight is basically the nigs vast he joos vs the queers vs the trannies vs the wahmen‚Ä¶.

                deprives the adherents of meaning and purposeYes. At least any true sense of meaning and purpose. Instead of a man working for the sake of his family or his community, the new line is that he must work becausehe likes it. Think, ‚ÄòI love my job‚Äô or ‚ÄòI want to do something I am passionate about‚Äô. Although perhaps there are many who do indeed ‚Äòlive to work‚Äô and that is the be-all-and-end-all.the food fight is basically the nigs vast he joos vs the queers vs the trannies vs the wahmen‚Ä¶.Probably been said here a trillion times, but may as well say it again: If diversity is truly allowed to dominate all institutions both public and private, quite how they can stop themselves from infighting long enough to crush YT is beyond me.

            Good take, Feliz ‚Äì the quasi-spiritual element of Wokeness is its primary appeal and Boomerwaffen‚Äôs commitment to the prosperity gospel of shallow capitalist materialism and ‚Äújust let me grill‚Äù selfish mentality makes them a perfect ‚Äúdevil‚Äù for Woke religion.
To fight them you need both your own devil and your own moral high ground.  We have that but we‚Äôre late getting in the game.  Give us time and give us platforms and we can make that clear.

            I‚Äôve toyed around with the idea of writing about how an insurgency would work in modern America. The trouble is the topic attracts too many nuts and I don‚Äôt want to spend all day deleting comments from them. I‚Äôll just say this. The anarchist bombings a century ago were poorly executed using crude materials. They were enough, however, to knock sense into the ruling class. Imagine what a small group of smart people with access to modern materials could do today?

                        Perhaps I‚Äôm projecting, but surely some allowance can be made for those who are just blowing off steam to cope with repressed anger.  If you can‚Äôt let your hair down amongst friends in a hostile world with few other outlets for a good venting, the angst and despair will overwhelm you.  At any rate, if I‚Äôve been guilty of an occasional blood-scented rant it‚Äôs certainly not because I‚Äôm trying to activate sleeper cells of what the media is now fronting as white supremacist terrorists.  Sadly, I know myself too well as a paper tiger.  As age enfeebles the eyes and the arm muscles, I could barely qualify with my pistol last week.  I have decided that CCW is no longer a wise option.  I guess I‚Äôll be relegated to sittin‚Äô on the porch with a shotgun as a rear guard.

                        The federal government exists to perpetuate it‚Äôs power. Very few people want to be ruled by antifa, but lots of people would like or tolerate being ruled by normal, conservative white guys. Thus, the fed cracks down on the normal group because it could fairly easily supplant them with popular support. This worry absolutely does not apply to antifa.

                    I don‚Äôt think the cities are anywhere near as vulnerable as people think they are.Cities are not randomly placed. They are almost always on navigable rivers and they have major interstates running into them not to mention scores and scores of smaller roads. There are large suburbs around the cities today.  There is a lot of redundancy built in.  There are many, many small power generation stations throughout the city and many micro-grids. There is a LOT of fuel storage inside the cities even with just in time delivery especially if passenger vehicles are banned. Most would comply.The big thing everyone thinks is a problem, the liberal pets, are fairly well cordoned, at least in my city. To the extent that they are armed, they are not well organized and what organization they do have is moving product and fighting competitors, not fighting cops. Whatever success they have overrunning the cops is during riots where the police are used to confine them to an area of a sacrifice zone. The cops have orders and they do what they are told. In a general insurrection, this would not be the case.  The years and years of riots means the cops know generally what to expect, what works and what doesn‚Äôt. They would have orders to crush the riots by any means necessary. This of course, assumes there are actual riots. If there were a general insurgency, the press would not be stoking riots they would be preaching unity to defeat the white supremacist terrorists.

                        Do you realize how easy ‚Äúmajor interstates‚Äù are to shut down? A fender bender in the fast lane during rush hour causes a huge backup that may take hours to clear. Image a couple of burning semi trucks in the right spots at the right time. The thing with rivers is you don‚Äôt have to shut them down, only the docks.

                            Do you realize how easy it is to close the interstates to traffic with limited access ramps?How about improvised docks?This is the problem people have. They superimpose normalcy onto the future event with one (and only one) thing changed. A good example is wait time. They imagine that an item that takes 18 months to get under normal circumstances persists into an emergency or that perfection is needed.    This is why people are almost always surprised at how quickly things go back to normal after the near-impossible scenario happens.  A few years ago (03) there was a major East coast grid failure from Canada down to New York. Subway service was restored in 4 hours. Some places probably were without electricity for weeks, but the main important stuff was back up in a matter of hours.In my city there are sub 10 megawatt level gas generators all over the city. Under normal circumstances they kick on during peak local demand.There is a lot of redundancy.

                                In my city not that long ago, a semi caught fire and burned on one of the freeways. After waiting for the fire to burn itself out and for the wreckage to cool down, it took 2 1/2 days to get it back open.You may have gas generators but where does the gas come from? A kid with some m-80s can take out a gas pipeline.

                                    Something similar has happened in my city a few times.  Tires cost money to get rid of and so a lot of unscrupulous people dump enormous numbers of tires in various places in the city including under overpasses. Back in the late 90s, there was a major tire fire under an overpass which shut down the interstate, though not all at once.  The repair was done in record time both times, on budget and on schedule. But the fire never fully shut it down and they did the repairs a lane at a time. I remember that one well because I drove through it every day. Another one happened more recently and it was also pretty well handled. Of course, all the usual racketeering was exempted because the repair was necessary. A white male owned firm got both of these jobs.

                            You make an inference to perhaps the real issue.

                            Yet, when the grid collapsed from Canada down to NY, the major portions were back up within hours.Our cities are not what they once were. I see the effects of clownworld daily. In my city, there are a lot of abandoned railroads and city street bridges that go over them. A bridge will get shut down and they literally throw a concrete barrier in front of it and redirect traffic onto an adjacent bridge indefinitely. There are potholes everywhere. Infrastructure is crumbling.I am going by my own experiences. Perhaps I am being fooled. But the system is largely able to limp along with duct tape and bailing wire. When failure happens, they are able to work around it fairly well.Frankly, I think it is utter fantasy that you can take out a major metropolitan area with a well placed attack on sub-station. People imagine that if a particular transformer takes 18 months to get under normal circumstances that if you take out that transformer, you take out that area for 18 months and that there are only 2 option:1) Restore grid back to pre-attack working state immediately.2) Cry that you have no electricity for 18 months.

                                Engineering is racist! We don‚Äôt need to repair or build any new bridges! üôÇI‚Äôm no expert, but large portions of New England had major outages in (I think) 1966 and 1978, they heyday of white competence wouldn‚Äôt you say. Things were restored in a day or so (these were summer outages, think) bu tthe point is the grid was vulnerable. I‚Äôm not in the industry, but articles over the years say that if anything, the grid is more interconnected. I suspect that a systemic failure could be triggered, but identifying the critical spot probably isn‚Äôt easy.

                        I live in California and the roads are so bad here that a single car accident can cut traffic speed in half for hours or block roads for near a day.And note do to every ass hat being high on weed , this is a nearly everyday problem.The running joke is ‚Äúif someone tried to shut down the roads on purpose how could you tell.‚ÄùAs for electricity, a couple of guys with rifles were  able to inflict several million in damage and screw with the power supply back in 2013 . They didn‚Äôt shut it down but they were never caught and it was a once off for unknown reasonsFrom Wikipediaunder slightly different conditions, there could have been serious power outages or worse.This is a public open forum and no place for discussing this sort of thing other than academically but the US is very vulnerable to concentrated attacks and the USG has been umable to do anything to prevent it.Easy? No. Risk Free? No. Certain Success? No. Doable? Unfortunately Yes.

                    Very much so. The anarchists and Bolsheviks scared the crap out of the ruling class and they moved quickly to round them up and deport them. There was already strong anti-immigrant sentiment in the country, so shutting down immigration was a popular remedy.

                    Invest some time in studying the immediate post WWI political situation in Europe.  It was a very near thing.  Most people have never heard of the Battle of Warsaw in 1920 (just had the 100th anniversary) Effectively the Poles cobbled enough men, women and luck with code breaking to defeat the Red Army in the suburbs of Warsaw.  There was nothing after that to stop them.  Wrote my thesis on the breakdown of the Washington Treaty system in Asia‚Äìbut lot of time spent reading Congressional Record debates on the 24 Act. We were highly cognizant of the risks of importing failed revolutionaries form Europe.  I was focused on the Japanese/American side, but was struck by how clearly many saw the threat and shut the door.

                I think the Oklahoma bombing set them back on their heels.Certainly reacted, got McVeigh executed in record time. The SC church and pitt synagogue shootings scared the hell outa a lot of people.  I sometimes wonder how many people in the US get a incurable cancer diagnosis a year?  What would happen if it became fashionable to compile a diagnosed-with-pancreatic-cancer-list? Like a bucket list, but malign. Another thought that has occurred to me is that this mask business largely defeats the facial recognition surveillance.

                    The OKC bombing ended the previous high water mark of State-sponsored domestic terrorism, which works. No one knows this better than the Inner Party, which has instigated this round, too. It learned from the previous experience and substituted psychopaths and sociopaths for federal law enforcement and bureaucrats.I think this will prove a mistake long term. They could control functionaries. These types cannot be stopped after a point.McVeigh likely was anticipated as a possible response to TPTB and that was baked into the cake. It is likely they anticipate the same again. Remember, the functionaries are expendable to these types and irrelevant outside their work. The lack of response so far has them bewildered. It may give them a false sense of security, or it may make them fearful of the golems they have unleashed.What Z wrote the other day is the best advice as long as it is possible: turn off, tune out and drop out. My bet is the Overclass has cast a bad die.

                    I don‚Äôt think any serious players were scared by these acts.  They merely used them to their advantage.  For all the romance and ooga-booga around ‚ÄúDay of the Rope‚Äù or ‚ÄúTurner Diaries‚Äù style dissident fiction, the real-life version doesn‚Äôt scare the elites that much.
They just use it as fear-and-smear fodder for the proles.
What scares them is White men acting openly in large numbers, not so much the Tyler Durden stuff.

                I don‚Äôt think violence would be that effective in our case, other than providing a little harassment around the periphery. Violence was somewhat effective in the ‚Äô60s, mostly because the current ruling class was ready to throw in their cards anyway, they didn‚Äôt need a lot of encouragement.The current ruling class has no such doubts about themselves, and violence will simply give them an excuse to land on us with both feet. The fact of the matter is that this isn‚Äôt the 18th century where it‚Äôs our muskets against the government‚Äôs muskets. The government is in a position to bring down overwhelming force, should they decide to do it.You notice that revolutions haven‚Äôt been very popular in Western nations for at least a century. Not even in Eastern bloc nations during the cold war. At the slightest hint of an uprising, the tanks roll in. And apparently the powers that be don‚Äôt believe the 2nd amendment covers tanks for the citizenry.Unfortunately, the only way to defeat this enemy is by gradually wearing them down until they lose interest in fighting. Or that the tide of public opinion has so turned against them such that leaving town suddenly sounds like a good idea.

                    This is correct. To accomplish amodus vivendi, we have to consider how to make the lives of the Ruling Class miserable in non-violent ways. There has to be creativity. Eventually there will be a brutal schism between the Judeo/Puritans and the Woke Sociopaths. Maybe recognize the latter as legitimate authority in places such as Portland? Dunno if that is the ticket, but it is an example of now to get where we need to be.

                    Yes, the government has enormous technology and armaments compared to private citizens. But don‚Äôt underestimae the crippling long-term effects of ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù in their ranks. Yes, there are competent people, otherwise our military would be completely useless. But also, as is sometimes discussed here, in a truly ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù situation, it is likely, perhaps even probable, that there would be mass resistance in the ranks to wholesale actions against private citizens. The beast wil thrash around and do a lot of damage, but we are ants and most of us are thus hard to target. Especially if we‚Äôve done nothing that would draw the Beast‚Äôs attention.

                        From what I can observe and get from people on active and reserve duty‚Äìthe tooth/tail ratio has grown dramatically on the latter side.  Seems to be one reason the same people are deployed over and over again.  There really are not that many ‚Äúwar fighters‚Äù in the modern military.  The ones we have are probably only rivaled in skills by the professional British army of late 1800s/early 1900s.

                    The current ruling class, the one that still has some legitimacy is getting old. There are a still some 50ish types like Ted Cruz but that is far from spring chicken territory.The rest including President Trump are rather old and in time age will claim all of them.The next group AOC and the like face a legitimacy  crisis.

                The biggest problem they would have, I think, is command and communications. There is nobody in America with the possible exception of Trump who has broad purchase with the right wing spectrum. The theoretical person really can‚Äôt be local. They have to have perceived authority across the country.This is one area where the left is light years ahead of the right. They have both people and the institutional presence to act at least somewhat in a cohesive manor. Just about every university in the country has left wing groups connected to other left wing groups and non-campus NGOs. They already have a command and control system set up.Just getting the whole (or significant) spectrum of the right wing to agree that ‚Äúit‚Äôs on‚Äù would be a near impossible task under present conditions. If these people (authority figures) do exist, they are underground and most people don‚Äôt know who they are.

                    Depends on your objectives. What law says that a resistance has to be centrally commanded and controlled? Centralized authority of any kind presents its own problems (and benefits, I concede). Do fifty (relatively, even today) sovereign States need to coordinate with each other on every detail of handling affairs within each State? How about the independent cities in each State? Towns? When you‚Äôre figuring out the family budget, or the wife is planning tonight‚Äôs meal, must you consult with the other families in the area?  Of course not. The point is that smaller entitites are possible, down ot the individual. They exist in normal times and they‚Äôll exist in abnormal times as well.

                        While I concede your point, the right MUST be unified in a general uprising. A unified army has a lot of advantages against the partisan. This doesn‚Äôt mean the partisan is powerless, but they are largely defensive and are unified in purpose only and not structurally.  A partisan military force is not trying to take control of secede, they are simply running interference against the occupier. Presumably the powers that were are to take control when the occupying enemy is driven out.With partisans, the purpose is self-evident, get the occupiers out and throw whatever sand you have into the gears of the enemy.A theoretical uprising in the US would be for the purposes of either breaking away from the US or taking it over. We have the major disadvantage that the ‚Äúoccupiers‚Äù are not, in the real sense a foreign army.  If an uprising (for lack of a better term) is to have any kind of success, it needs to fought everywhere.  If it is localized, they are absolutely doomed.On the plus side, we have many states now that are in open rebellion of the feds on a variety of issues. We have local authorities facilitating criminal activity. We have more states that want to flaunt different federal laws. The whole system is being held together with money. If they have money problems, we could see changes that are unthinkable today.

                The only certainty is that it never works out the way the advocates think it will.  And there are always ‚Äúpeople of the middle‚Äù-think Girondists and Mensheviks that go in thinking they can ride the tiger. Until it eats them.  Right after the collapse of the Soviet Union there was a Russian produced film titled ‚ÄúThe Chekist‚Äù.  Probably the most disturbing look I‚Äôve ever seen of what happens when the tiger decides he no longer wants to be ridden.

        It‚Äôs sort of like that person we know who is not a nice person and a bad parent yet they think of themselves as wise and good.When they get into their 70‚Äôs and start looking at whom they will leave their inheritance to it starts to scare the crap out of them. The next generation is even worse than themselves but they got no idea why?The Judeo Puritans have created a monster and that monster now wants it‚Äôs power and it‚Äôs inheritance.

        America‚Äôs founding myth glorifies the revolution.  But revolutions were and are far more likely to produce a Robespierre or a Mao Zedong than a Thomas Jefferson or a George Washington.  There are a thousand little Maos running around the college campus. if there are any Thomas Jeffersons, they are being called fascists and run off the campus.  They are the bad guys and they don‚Äôt know it.Evil people rarely laugh maniacally and do evil deeds for evil‚Äôs sake. Everyone thinks they are the good guy. They have been presented with fake evil that doesn‚Äôt really exist all their lives and they fail to see the evil in the mirror.

                Well, they were risking death.  Had the British been able to quell the rebellion, these men would have been hung as traitors and none of us would have ever heard of them or if we did, hold them in the same esteem as Benedict Arnold (a hero of the alternative revolution story).

        ‚ÄúThey are rolling the dice on this intersectional intifada in the hope that the other side weakens themselves.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs an interesting debate on whether the BLM/Antifa golem has fallen out of control of the puppetmasters (‚ÄúFree Palestine!‚Äù) or whether it‚Äôs still fully in control.I used to think the golem was spiraling out of control, but after seeing the police immediately crush those two ‚Äúfar right‚Äù (milquetoast civnat centrist) Proud Boy idiots who roughed up that violent Antifa puppet, I‚Äôm convinced the BLM/Antifa golem is still fully in control. The cops‚Äô reaction proves that the golem is on a leash and that it‚Äôs being led around to exhaust itself. The Burning-Looting-Murder is fully sanctioned by the state, media, corporations and ‚Äúintelligence community.‚Äù Proud Boys are unwitting idiots for interfering and thinking they should ‚Äúdo something.‚Äù ‚ÄúBack the Blue‚Äù people are also too stupid to realize that the cops exist solely to protect violent coloreds from appropriate and overdue retaliation from victimized whites; coloreds increasingly recognize this and are backtracking on their ‚Äúdefund‚Äù oopsie.Halfway through the Obama administration the ‚Äúintelligence community‚Äù realized that, after Iraq, Americans no longer had appetites for conventional ground warfare, airstrikes or even drone warfare, so they shifted to ‚ÄúColor Revolutions.‚Äù Someone on twitter succinctly said that the Judeo-Puritan elite now spreads globohomo through rent-a-tranny rioters, dildos and gay pride flags rather than through outdated conventional warfare. This elite has now become quite brazen in advocating for a Color Revolution at home to crush the white populism that Trump represents ‚Äî it‚Äôs stated quite explicitly in all the media.

            The ‚Äúdefund‚Äù meme is truly puzzling. Ever since the 1960s cops have existed solely to protect nonwhite criminals from white victims, yet the ‚Äúdefund‚Äù people want to remove the thin blue line that protects nonwhites from retaliation?My guess is that local police are still too messy, decentralized, erratic and inadequate in the protection they provide nonwhites, so the establishment thinks state and federal forces would be able to do a much better job protecting nonwhites and ‚Äúred flagging‚Äù (killing) on sight any and all white victims ‚Äî see the Duncan Lemp story.But yes, police deserve zero support and deserve to be defunded and unemployed en masse. They somehow have all the resources they need to push around the Proud Boys (idiots that they are), yet they can‚Äôt seem to stop BLM and Antifa attacking random people at restaurants.

        ‚ÄúStarting this week, there are no more cops. The most likely result is heavily armed Patriot Prayer people enter the city and it is open season on the Left with no bag limit.‚ÄùYou‚Äôre not paying sufficient attention. A few nights ago, four armed ex-SOCOM with combat experience were run off by the insurgents. They were disabled immediately they showed up by strobe lights and pepper spray. Never had a chance. Actually had to run away.The Portland mob, and others, contains several paramilitary squads who are well-trained, well-armed, well-led and coordinated. They conduct surveillance and recon patrols. They contain some violent psychopaths for wet work, like Reinhoehl and Rosebaum.The seeming rabble, most young white women, are incorporated into the paramilitary‚Äôs tactics as human shields.The paramilitary squads are more than a match for the Portland Police and the Oregon State Police. You need, at a minimum, a regular Army or National Guard MP company, perhaps a full infantry company.The riots in various cities actually constitute a true insurrection, and they have the full support of and participation in by the local elected officials, mayors, city councilmen, governors‚Ä¶And they are winning.

                And that was enough, wasn‚Äôt it? Some doughnut munchers with pee shooters were able to beat up on the redneck resistance. Don‚Äôt think destroying these leftists will be as easily done as said.

                    Because the former soldiers are massively outnumbered and could not fire into the crowd. If you read the article you know that there were police right there who refused to help them yet would definitely have arrested them if they had fired blindly into the crowd.
Things would be completely different if there were no police.

                It won‚Äôt happen because MAGA is too useful as a kosher corral for dissident sentiment.  The grassroots antifa shooters don‚Äôt see it that way but the (((elites))) still control the courts, cops and prosecutors.

            I read most of this book (https://www.amazon.com/Fry-Brain-Sniping-Guerrilla-Warfare/dp/0971413398) before inevitably losing interest.  One of the points it made was that a sniper, shooting once, maybe with a blanket wrapped around the barrel, is nearly impossible to track down in such an urban environment, especially by irregulars like BLMfa.  One unsolved sniper kill might be enough, but two would certainly clear the streets, however it would have to be done by locals who could melt back into their environment.This brings me to the next point that I harp on: residents in Portland and Seattle cannot be bothered to protect their own neighborhoods, so there is no way that anyone else should volunteer to do so.  Externally organized forces are about as likely to resolve the issues in those cities (and elsewhere) as they are to solve inner city black crime and for the same reason: the residents are perfectly fine with it.

            They were not socom and there were only two of them.  They were not there to lock horns with antifa.  They were killing time prior to an interview with the Portland PD.  They were both carrying concealed but knew better than to do anything but retreat after being pepper sprayed by antifa.  Try to keep the hyperbole to a minimum.

        A million people wandering the streets shouting incoherent drivel is not a threat to the system. A million people suddenly opting out of the system is. The first is a nuisance, the latter has the potential to break the chain of interlocking parts that are needed to run the thing.
The interesting thing about the Covid 19 response was that our ruling class tried it without even realizing they were playing with forces they have no concept of.

                That‚Äôs all most whites want. We just want to be left alone and grill.
Unfortunately tptb want to genocide us instead of letting us eat burgers and watch football.
Gamers just wanted to game, until Gamergate came along. And that is really when the current thing started. Leftists are mentally deranged and incapable of ever just leaving us alone (to their detriment in the end).

        In Medieval times the Universities would be a bunch of students under the direction of a licensed instructor from the Church who would show up anywhere there was space and teach lessons.As campuses get more and more bloated and the teachers get more and more ridiculous, it‚Äôs eventually going to collapse back into this form where travelling academics will find a place to set up shop and teach to a core group of students, or just have a zoom session.  Then several competing credentialing bodies will take the place the Church had and ensure the instructor can actually teach.As corporations no longer have the the certitude that people graduating can actually do menial tasks, they are going to care less about students being in a well-known brick-and-mortar institution and rely more on entrance tests, while ensuring that enough diversity gets through to warm seats to bypass possible lawsuits.

            Looking at colleges with my son and comparing it to my college days.  The schools all seemed to have gone on building sprees.  The new buildings are architecturally terrible and ugly on the outside.  On the inside they seem to have as much office space for the bureaucrats as classrooms and labs. (i remember meeting with professors in offices the size of broom closets)Dorms are now luxury apartments in cheaply buildings.

                Like the joke I recently heard about marriage: ‚ÄúWhy bother? Just find a woman who hates you and give her your house.‚Äù Applied to sending your son off to university.

                Visiting my alma mater with one of my sons, went into the old student union where the food choice in my day was a grill where work/study student slung hamburgers for a $1.20 each with fries.  Was replaced with a branded food court where students could swipe their meal cards.  The centerpiece was a formal ‚ÄúFarm to Table‚Äù restaurant featuring seasonal menus put together by the university‚Äôs Executive Chef‚Ä¶.yes they now have one of those.  Long gone were the end of quarter ‚Äúmystery meals‚Äù conjured up from whatever was left in cold storage. And you wonder why it costs what it does.

                    It really is an amazing transformation. In my prep school, our cafeteria was vending machines and a microwave. The vending machines were the old automat style things that still worked and some guy stocked them with fresh sandwiches every morning. In college, it was mostly the same, except there was a place that sold burgers and hot dogs. The burgers were those super-flat patties that had an odd gray color to them when cooked. No one thought anything of it.Today, the college has a food court like you would see at the mall, but the food is booshie stuff like organic salads and fresh fruit smoothies.A friend tells me his school now has a fitness spa with a rock climbing facility and full time trainers for the kids.

                As Ben points out aptitude tests got zapped in the way back, so employers relied vicariously on the SAT via the ranking of the school that accepted you.  Some of best business people I‚Äôve worked with over the years worked for a certain London institution that also begins with ‚ÄúL‚Äù and began out of high school as clerks, learned the business from the ground up and can still be found running prominent syndicates.  Less OxBridge accent, but a lot more common sense.

        I keep thinking that the insanity can‚Äôt get any worse (because eventually these retards will start dancing on the interstate and get mowed down by a drunk driver, which has happened). But it is getting worse, and there is no end in sight. Yes, someone needs to put these dysfunctional deviants out of their misery, but everything is upside down now and the root of the problem is at the top, and not the bottom, of the pyramid.

        A few days ago a colleague of mine sent me an interesting link to a YouTube video called ‚Äú5 Types of Bullsh*t Jobs with David Graeber‚Äù.While listening to his presentation, I quickly identified and labeled a large number of people I have to work with which he identified as (1) Flunkies, (2) Goons, (3) Duct Tapers, (4) Box Tickers and (5) Task Masters.Then, while reading this post, I immediately thought about how that same list applies to the American education system.From what you‚Äôve said, it would seem there are a large number of bullsh*t Colleges and Universities in the US which are full of these same sorts of people all justifying their bullsh*t jobs too.

        The Washington &amp; Lee course is likely useful but in thevia negativasense ‚Äì almost everything you will learn will not be an effective challenge to actual power. So at least you‚Äôll learn what not to do.Everyone from antifa to MAGA thinks they are challenging power.Anfifa wearing the latest Woke fashions consume Globoshlomo products as they plan to murder and pillage Globoshlomo‚Äôs enemies.MAGAs likewise ‚Äì their clothes, their food &amp; drink, their entertainment and their politics have been supplied by the ‚Äúother‚Äù side of the same multinational kosher sandwich of megacorps, NGO‚Äôs, think tanks, media etc‚Ä¶If antifa was a threat to the system, it would not enjoy 95% support from that system. If MAGA had any dissident energy, it would not be queer as a three-dollar bill, 50 shades of Brown and more Jewish than that odious Zionist terrorist Tucker goy-groveled to last week.When you want to subvert a much larger host population, divide &amp; conquer is the way to go. Provide them plausible but misleading half-truth alternatives that set them at odds with each other inside an Overton-arena where true issues of power and sovereignty are not up for discussion.To know who your rulers are, ask who you cannot question. To know who‚Äôs challenging power, ask who must be silenced.We all know what those sides are. The rest is distraction, deflection, circus, spectacle and Talmudry.

            What strikes me about both sides, the MAGA and Antifas, is how unhealthy both of them look, but in different ways.  They absolutely are lifestyle consumers, and may as well have their own demos on VALS.  The MAGAs looking diabetic, chubby, a complete lack of any muscle tone, while the Antifas are a mix of chubby vegan women (who eat way too many carbs and lack protein) and mostly men with gaunt, drawn faces.  Both get their wardrobe from central casting.  Antifa from H&amp;M and MAGA from Bass Pro.

            You are right about who you can criticize and who you cannot mention.But‚Ä¶Five percent of Antifa is infinitely larger than, say, The Order was in the Eighties, and much bigger than the Weathermen and the Black Panthers were in the Sixties. All of those had state-sponsorship to some degree, too, and still a few went rogue in directions that were neither expected nor welcomed.The Cloud People‚Äôs mercenaries and step-‚Äòn-fetchits have loosed hundreds if not thousands of sociopaths with tactical experience and probably a few with familiarity with WMD‚Äôs. The next McVeigh will be a dissident Antifa. Mark it. This will not end well for the Clouds‚Äô paid men, and even though most of these domestic terrorists will fall into line, as will be the case with 95 percent (to use your number) of Antifa, they have screwed the pooch here. One percent going rogue would be tough enough for them. These are the ones who are not LARP‚Äôing, too.This may play out well for us. We need to protect ourselves and our own and laugh and meme as Alt-Antifa forces the toadies to plea to the True Cons‚Äô patriotism and grilling skills.

        ‚ÄúThe truth is, the people in charge think this intersectionality stuff is insane too.‚ÄúWe thought that about the Soviet leadership. But it turned out that they all believed the bullshit they‚Äôd been taught, because they lived in a culture where all the best people believed that bullshit. They may have been exposed to the truth at some point, but they had no reason to take it seriously.The new bullshit isn‚Äôt really new. It‚Äôs the old liberal bullshit taken to its logical conclusion by people who spent their whole lives exposed to nothing else. Biden grew up in a world where people talked openly about what black people and gays are like. I don‚Äôt know what (or if) he thinks today, but in his prime he knew the score. He knew why blacks do poorly in school and get in trouble with the police. He wasn‚Äôt going to make policy decisions that depended on black people actually being equal.His heirs don‚Äôt know the score. They really believe the bullshit. They think black people are acting like that because of witchcraft, and that the witchcraft is reversible.

        Take a look at Lexington VA City Council members. They have been slowly erasing Southern history from that town. They recently renamed the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery despite a petition of thousands objecting to it so it will be more inclusive. The Robert E. Lee Hotel is changing its name and the council also called for Washington and Lee to drop Lee, even though he was a distinguished President at that university and both he and Jackson are buried in Lexington. It is an attack on Southern culture, history and heritage. I sent them a scathing email.

                The council actually asked for emails and got quite a number which took them days to read.They did not like some of the comments.

                All good ideas the GOP should have gotten started on in earnest in February 2020. But they never had any plans anyway. Instead of putting big tech‚Äôs balls in a vise, they gave them tax cuts in exchange for having their base silenced. They don‚Äôt want to fight. They want to collect donations. Their base is a hassle. They love it when big tech steps on anybody who wants them to actually fight back against the left.

        There is a great deal of hubris within the Inner Party. Can it control the Intersectional Intifada? Maybe short-term. Can the Inner Party eliminate the Intersectional Intifada long-term? They have bet the farm on it. I wouldn‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt.Judeo/Puritan control of the Inner Party appears solid but really is tenuous. If Heritage America and the Intersectional Intifada could come to some sort of separation agreement, the Judeo/Puritan Overclass would die immediately. My bet is the Inner Party‚Äôs first goal is to make sure that is impossible and the wedge remains intact. It is a solid bet if the chips were down, those professors and other system grifters would side with the Judeo/Puritan wing. Forget their rhetoric. They know who butters their bread. The worse psychopaths of that coalition have figured it out, too. We are seeing that play out now on the streets of Portland, and soon an Antifa mayor will preside over the violence. That is the future of Far Left.

        Yassir Arafat and the PLO were in a power struggle with Hamas and other Islamic groups. The Intifada was about who would enjoy the spoils of being Israel‚Äôs puppet in the occupied territories.You can find articles online for the Wall Street Journal and other respectable news sources pretty much saying that Hamas was a israeli creation to weaken the PLO.My impression of the Israelis is that they always preferred to deal with Sunni terror groups, even favoring and helping them like in Syria than ‚Äúsecular‚Äù rulers like Assad, Nasser and Saddam or Shia militants like Iran and Hezbollah. This could explain why the Sunni Arab Gulf Sheiks are all eating at Netanyahu hands.

There really are no impediments to them seizing power, other than Bill Barr (who is losing his FedCop troops the more they see of him).

They can handle Trump because Trump is a girl when it comes to Blood.

            Your figures are accurate (+/- few percentage points, probably varies over time.) What I find scarier and it‚Äôs one of the more obscure statistics is that in inter-racial crime, black-on-white is many times 30 or more, compared to white-on-black; rape and other sexual assault are virtually all black perps. [Bleeding heart alert!] Often overlooked is that the vast majority of crimes are within the same race. Given the black violent crime rate is 5-10 times the white rate, blacks victiimization by other blacks is one of their worst dirty secrets. Add to this that the majority of serious crimes probably aren‚Äôt even reported (even the murder clearance rate is pretty low.), I figure maybe 8-10 felonies committed for each one arrested, who knows really? Top it all with the anti-police and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt snitch‚Äù mentality, and all their other woes, and you really have a wretched subculture. üôÅ But white racism must be to blame, somehow‚Ä¶

        I would love to know the median student loan debt of the average ANTIFA.  This debt can‚Äôt be discharged in bankruptcy.  It‚Äôs always with you, and it amortizes over time as your coffee shop gig doesn‚Äôt pay the bills.  It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to leave podunk liberal arts colleges with six figures in debt.  This is like buying a house, burning it down, and still paying the mortgage which can‚Äôt be discharged.  A broad, sweeping action of allowing people to discharge bad student loans while ending the entire subsidized student loan program would be ideal.  But we‚Äôll probably get the loan forgiveness as the program is allowed to continue.

        ‚ÄúHow to Overthrow the State.‚ÄùThe Left isn‚Äôt really interested in overthrowing the State. It‚Äôs a dog whistle, a clarion call for the mob to assault the Left‚Äôs racial enemies, normal whites in places like Kansas, whom the Left stereotypes as being synonymous with the State. This tactic has been common throughout history. The allies portrayed the Germans as child-murdering barbarians during the First World War, for instance. The point was to rile up the masses to hate some approved enemy and take pressure off the Ruling Class whose decisions might otherwise be questioned by the angry masses. It‚Äôs not meant to be taken literally.The Ruling Class tolerates this stuff because they get the true meaning of what‚Äôs being said. If this weren‚Äôt the case, MSNBC would be busy altering the faces of the democrat party‚Äôs enemies like they did with Tulsi Gabbard during her primary debate. Google would be terminating access to their websites with a fake excuse as they also did with Gabbard. They‚Äôd be planting stories in the press alleging their enemies were Russian agents the way they did with true threats to the Ruling Class‚Äôs pocket book, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.

        Which would be worse? The slack jawed wokels are crazy but incompetent. That has pros and cons. The judeo puritans are also crazy and often psychotic, and they are also somewhat competent meaning they may be able to establish relative stabiliy.
At first blush, seems we would be better off in the long run with the incompetent wokes.

        except that the judeo-puritans are running low in numbers, and the peoples they bring in to replace at least partly help the rainbow (with some relatively based exceptions that are now helping the right, if the polls about hispanics surging for trump are to be believed).but yes, sowing dissension in ranks is helpful. the right does this by calling back the ethnic pride of the antifa shocktroops, or that of other whites affected by them at least. also, showing the internal contradiction and degeneracy achieved by prog and marxist values in the long run. also, by shoving pics of white deaths of despair and crime in the face of people, on subways, off bulletins next to leftoid causes; if hopefully not becoming a Kyle nor a martyr. although there are always some, paul kersey shows them.meanwhile the right should do more family-friendly things, trump funny videos, churches, camping, concerts, videogame tournaments, anything nonscary for the optics people looking for Dylanns to hate ‚Äì create a united front, not only of people who gather to vote every once in a while, but of a parallel ethnoculture that reflects the true nation ‚Äì and can then take on the parasites and degenerates.

            ‚ÄúRun‚Äù is possibly too strong a term, plus the world is just too big and varied to be ‚Äúrun‚Äù by a particular group completely. However, controlled or strongly influenced is not an unreasonable observation. Major world events do not simply happen without some effort. A certain degree of freedom will always be present within well policed parameters.

        Zman do you follow the Youtube Styxhexenhammer666? He is a basic Libertarian but he does Co-host with Ramzpaul so maybe he is a good on-ramp from his large libertarian audience to views more aligned with Ramzpaul which match yours Zman üôÇ

        Some guy above: ‚ÄúSince the 1960s cops have existed solely to protect nonwhite criminals from white victims.‚ÄùSome other guy above: ‚ÄúCops exist solely to protect violent coloreds.‚ÄùCommon talking point on the D-Right.  Yet the reality of half a million blacks in American prisons doesn‚Äôt support the notion.But keep on with the binary cliches about cops.  Friend or foe; come the fog of war, we could use them.  I keep a magnetic blue line flag on my car.  They see it.  They see my color.  A reminder that we‚Äôre on the same team, despite what their bosses tell them to do.

Because of the cops, they are in prison, not dead.

            Prisons are like day care for them. Also, they are dramatically undercarcerated: half a million is very low relative to the amount of crime they wreak on every community. Why wasn‚Äôt Jacob Blake still in prison, for example?
In a rural area the small town cop might still be ‚Äúon your team‚Äù but everywhere else they‚Äôre not. Blue line flags didn‚Äôt help Michelle Malkin.

                At Cville, some of the guys were chanting pro-police slogans and a half an hour later the police were pushing them into antifa and laughing while they did it.

                    I respect your opinion on the matter. Having experienced it for real must be a   mental game changer.  I‚Äôve been dicked by cops like most everyone.  But yeah, nothing like what you went through.

            The ‚ÄúI support the cops‚Äù bumper-sticker routine hasn‚Äôt worked since the 90‚Äôs.  You can do the NACALT bit and it‚Äôs true to some extent, especially in smaller departments, among deputies and ruralites, but in general coprace is not on our side.
