        Ancient Greek speaks about guardians, and the way to remove inferiority is removing inferior peopleConfucius said the same thing with different tones, which some people deserve treated as nobleman and some people deserve treated as serfs
Only bible asserts all people must be treated as equal, strangely this concluded that out-group accepted as in-groupSo it doesn’t matter what belief that western establishment had, its desert people bullshit anyway
the point is white men still had opportunity to kill them all and yet they choose to submit

            St. Augustine on Galatians 3:28:
Difference of race or condition or sex is indeed taken away by the unity of faith, but it remains imbedded in our mortal interactions, and in the journey of this life the apostles themselves teach that it is to be respected, and they even proposed living in accord with the racial differences between Jews and Greeks as a wholesome rule.

        From the Merriam interview:“We know from the expert report submitted in the Harvard case that if Harvard were to accept only the top decile of applicants based solely on objective academic factors, Harvard’s student body would be only 0.76% black. Today, with the use of affirmative action, Harvard is roughly 15% black (as compared to 13% of the population). Just about no one—and certainly not anyone with the power to make decisions on these issues—would support forcing Harvard to adopt an admissions policy that would make it less than 1% black. As a result, even the critics of affirmative action must find some way to say we can eliminate affirmative action without substantially affecting black enrollment.“This is why Students for Fair Admissions, the group that brought the lawsuit against Harvard’s affirmative action program, claimed in the oral argument that even if the Court ruled against affirmative action, Harvard could—and should—gerrymander its admissions formula to ensure that blacks would be at least 10% of the student body. In other words, even the affirmative action opponents were so committed to a critical mass of black students that they argued in favor of a black quota at more than ten times what merit would warrant. ”Given that the people “on our side” accept all the premises of the enemy, it is no wonder we lose.

            What a lot of people don’t know is that in a strictly meritocratic system at the Ivy League, the big winners wouldn’t be Asians, it would be White gentiles, as White gentiles are the ones giving up all the slots to affirmative action, and to legacy/nepotism Jews.
We are a suicidal people, apparently.

                Is it possible that the prestige of Harvard is draining so quickly that these token negros are gaining nothing especially worthwhile by attending? Think of how much prestige the Ivys have lost just in the last 4 years. By the time these negros “graduate,” there may be very little of it left. Only respected by their fellow Ivys perhaps, and not the older ones.

                    If I remember the stats I read a while back correctly, I believe it was less than 11% of them ever finish school.  They can’t do the work.  Thats probably changing now because despite their inability to do it, they will be pushed through with preferences just like they are with everything else in life.

            For about twenty years, Republicans had entirely stopped talking about “affirmative action”—until it was recently reframed as discrimination against Asians, a thing they thought they could safely oppose, because they’re suckers. It was such a “beta” move, it snapped Westernized Asians out of their normal ethnic rivalry with white people into a genocidal hatred for us. Well played, conservatives.

        I forget Jack Dobson’s surprising observation that often, the Puritan or dynastic types were equally and amorally using the Jews.That’s a big blind spot to us antisemites, the von Leydens, Merkels, Pences, and Johnsons.   After we are free of one pack of wolves, we mustn’t forget the dark triads in our own.  They bring us nothing but trouble…and they outnumber the 2%.I don’t think they can hide as well, nor last as long with such unremitting enmity.  But heartless is heartless, and our current system selects for its own kind of heartlessness.  It’s the old class problem in new clothes.Credit to Jack, Layabout, and Whiskey for reminding us, and screw anybody who attacks a good friend like Gottfried, or even a bold lass like Anna.

            Judas priest.  Proof of concept.  Americans, at this level white Americans, way outnumber the 2%.  What a malignant synergy.It’s become its own ecosphere.
It started, here, with cibil rights; it started in Russia with war against the aristocracy. Both ended up as a Sovietized system…hey, isn’t that what Trotsky wanted all along?  To carve out a niche so his own could thrive?  One resistant to the ameliorating effects of Christian “God, King, and Country?”

                    Thus, the Troskyites who fled Russia and Germany, and came here to form the neocons.
First, they had to take the schools, from whence all credentials flow.  They did that with martial force, bayonets pointed at white teenagers in the South.

THEY THREATENED OUR KIDS WITH DRAWN BAYONETS, like a conquering religion, like the Yankee abolitionist radicals, and we did…nothing.
We fell in line, even celebrated what we had only tolerated, and why?  Because of a passive-aggressive mindset, the sheep’s clothing made of our native religion.  And here we are, 70 years later.

                Pompeo is Koch brothers connected from way back. After getting out of the Army and going to law school, he founded an “aerospace company,” of all things, in Wichita, Kansas, of all places, with the Kochs providing the VC seed money. He had no connection to aerospace or Wichita prior, so it seemed kind of odd. Oh, another investor in his company was Bain and Co, led by CEO Mitt Romney.He sold his stake in the aerospace company and became an oil executive, at another Koch connected company. Then he became a congressman.It’s all there on his wikipedia page, they don’t even try to hide it. The only unanswered question is why the Kochs took an interest in him

            Thanks for the shout-out, Al, and great take. Look at those Columbia and NYU “kids.” Not many Mustafas in the bunch, but a lot of feral children of the original enemy. They murdered hundreds of thousands of our people here at home and then took their gorefest on a never-ending blood crusade.
Those Puritan hell spawn would run a sword through just as quickly as their great-great-grandfathers did their blood kin at Antietam, and they are perfectly capable of torching the world with nukes.

                I didn’t tie up my point: the feral spawn are mau-mauing the Tribe’s as a flex for getting too uppity and embarrassing them with Gaza. Not my circuis, not my monkeys, but fascinating.
They just descended, and I mean a lot of them, on Schumer’s Brooklyn home. This will get violent soon enough because these are two groups of crazies.

        My criticism is that belief does not just arise out of the ether. Beliefs are adopted or not by the elites to the extent that they support the most powerful force among humans: the dynastic impulse. We ordinary White people are so atomized and bereft of that impulse that we forget that elites are NOT like that. Their dynastic impulse is so strong as to be like a black hole’s gravitational field. Ours is so weak with fractured or non-existent families we cannot understand the force.The beliefs in “equality” are very much NOT applied to their own lives. Look at how the elites live, act, work, recreate, marry, etc. Very much it is exclusionary, dynastic, and designed to both fend off competition from ordinary White people who are talented and cement opportunities for their offspring. Feudal lords is a better mental model for the elites than that of Puritan true believers. And even those beliefs were mostly aimed at eliminating charitable burdens that were a drag on the elites inheritances. The Witch Trials were aimed at old ladies who wer public burden.Elites just really HATE HATE HATE ordinary people as they are a direct threat to their idiot offspring inheriting the Big Boss Man title. “Equality” is just their self-serving cant to justify kicking out the ladder of upward mobility for real threats: White men from flyover country. Who never went to a Swiss boarding school.Note: Smith and Wesson is rumored to have massive quality control as they moved to Tennessee from Massachusetts and lost their older White male machinists and hired vibrant diverse ones. People are pointing to Hollywood’s inability to do any decent stories, effects, cinematography, acting, directing as it has become “diverse and inclusive.” The fight at the Ivies particularly Columbia is over the victorious “Coalition of the Ascendant” — gays, blacks, muslims, etc. deciding (((certain people))) are no longer wanted/needed and to include them out. This is the always-downfall of elite politics. Certain groups always get pushed out and while they myth of the Colors of Benetton serves to destroy ambitious proles,  larger and more aggressive groups can use street fighting to usurp the former Big Boss Men.

        Ironic choice of words: “level” as a verb can mean:In today’s use, of course it means, “to equalize, to smooth such that no person, place or thing is lower or higher than another.”But more ominously, it might mean “to point a weapon” or “to demolish, as a building or city.”Yes indeed, sometimes ideologues succeed, for a time, in making everything “level.” Problem is that the result often resembles a salt or tidal flat: a planar landscape stretching from horizon to horizon, where nothing grows, no distinguishing feature allowed.“Ashes and diamonds, foe and friend, we were all equal in the end.”— Pink Floyd/Roger Waters

                    The difference is naggers will win the cases, whitey will be thrown out of court. Like Obama said “the words on paper” don’t matter, what matters is what is in the hearts of men &amp; women. Whites with any self-preservation instinct at all are a vanishing minority.

                Didn’t do much for Allan Bakke (1978) in CA and his denial for admission to med school, nor anyone other White applying to med school.
Why?  Because, they simply worked around the specifics of the case and left it up to the Courts to again find anti-White discrimination in (new and improved) admissions considerations.  We were all fooled then, but not any more.

                    The Bakke story is quite interesting. Alan Bakke eventually got admitted to med school and became a successful physician.
Patrick Chavis, a Negro who was (originally) admitted with inferior qualifications in Bakke’s place, became an abortionist and a liposuctionist, and had his license revoked for negligence, incompetence, malpractice, and causing the deaths of patients — but not before winning $1 million in a “racial discrimination” lawsuit.
He died at age 50 when he was shot to death in the ‘hood.

        The liberals are demonstrating they hold the whip-hand once again.What a thrill of power it must give them! It reminds me of when Glenn Beck wrote a “guest piece” for the New York Times weekday edition. That radio talk show host, ostensibly conservative, sang the praises of the black visitors he had welcomed to his bastion of real talk. He said they were very nice, and would be welcome back any time. Right.Let’s get this straight. The Left mindf*cks the Right into kow-towing its line, and even offers a platform for his self-immolation and -humiliation. Then, smirking, it turns around and pats Glenn Beck on the head like a good little boy.It’s mindf*ckery and mockery all down the line. The Left *knows* Glenn Beck has only a superficial belief in its equalitarian philosophy, like the thin soil of the Amazon. Beck is a de-fanged piranha in an ecosystem that has grown to hate him. More’s the pity. If he spoke up about what was *really* in his heart, we might have some entertainment cooking! As it is the “R” word (racism) silences all opposition as efficiently as a knife to the throat.— Xloveli (www.dark.sport.blog)

        Good essay. This side of things has a real blind spot when it comes to the amount of clown world that has deep roots in Christian universalism. It’s not uncommon to read on DR type sites that “if we could just put white, Christian, patriarchal men back in charge, that would be the end of the honking!”, which conveniently ignores who was holding the levers of power during early stages of the circus(women didn’t give themselves the power to vote).
Is there even a single non-pozzed mainstream Western church left to produce to produce these new white Christian men anyways?

            Precisely. While it may not be flattering to “our thing,” I defy anybody here to name one, just one social movement, political or ideological change since the Renaissance, that affected Western government, religion or culture, that was NOT mostly if not entirely impelled by a faction comprised of 100% genuine European, usually Christian and Protestant or “Proto-Protestant” Caucasians. And please don’t lay all the blame on Jews, as we are wont to do. Yes, the Jews have much to answer for, but the glaring fact is that they’ve rarely been more than a chemical trace as a percentage of total population of Western nations. Folks, nearly all these troubles we brought on ourselves, like it or not.

                Jewish Influence in Christian Reform Movements:
In his work, Rabbi Newman documents the struggle between Christianity and Judaism. The Rabbi also includes information on Jewish Influence in fomenting the Protestant revolt against the Catholic Church, which led to the freeing of Jews from Church strictures and mainstreaming them into the political and social life of Christendom, particularly in Protestant countries. Newman even takes up the topic of Jewish influence in Puritan New England. All in all, this is an important book for those wishing to understand the mutual antipathies which have beset Christians and Jews.

                We really did bring it on ourselves in my thinking.As European ingenuity increased living standards in the West, fewer and fewer people were reliant on Christian charity for their basic needs. Christians still needed an outlet for the charity that they are commanded to do, though.Voila, it starts making sense to start considering whether it is charitable to give away things that would be closer to the top of Maslow’s hierarchy(civil rights, disparate impact, etc.), and/or start sending the nation’s wealth abroad to places like Africa that just can’t get it’s shit together despite being fellow Christians.Slippery slope from there.

                        I’d still not vote against Whites.  Blacks may have had the good sense and fortune not to take the “tea”, but that doesn’t make them any smarter to survive and thrive—even in Africa.

                        The problem isn’t intelligence.
The problem is the absence of COMMON SENSE [the voice of Reason emanating from the Amygdala].
Kneegr0wz in the Congo still cling dearly to their Common Sense.
Whereas Whites in Massachusetts have been driven bat-sh!t-phμcking insane [and mass addiction to psychotropics such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors sure as he11 ain’t helping matters].

Regarding Massachusetts, I wasn’t thinking in terms of major human genotypes; I was thinking more in terms of, “How many descendants of unitardians will still live &amp; breed in the state of Massachusetts in the 22nd or 23rd Century?”
If it’s true that the primary purpose of the MRNA v@xxines was the sterilization of the recipients of the MRNA v@xxines, then unitardianism is not long for this world.

                I’m always willing to take a shot at the Jews, but at the same time, I realize everything you say is true.
My biggest problem with Jews is not the Jews themselves. It’s mostly with all the cuck love they get from cuck Republicans when they do absolutely nothing for us in return.
It’s as brilliant as one-sided free trade. But what else would you expect from the stupid party?

                    The cuck Republicans, represented most strongly by those comfortable with the current cultural dynamic, have a problem: their consciences. Like the Alien face-hugger in the scifi/horror movie, their conscience has been implanted in them by a foreign force, the liberal hive-mind. As long as the hive mind is wrapped around the cuck’s head, he cannot breathe for himself and must take air intake from his parasitic “guest.” When the liberal drops off and dies, the implanted “conscience” begins to grow and eat away at the insides, until one day (soon) it bursts out of the heart cavity in an explosion of bleeding-heart liberalism.

                        X, I think you’re giving them way too much credit.My thinking is that almost all of the Republicucks hold their positions because David Barnea [and his predecessors, going back at least half a century or more] has in his possession [in the Mossad library] thousands upon thousands of hours of high quality audio &amp; video of those very Republicucks s0d0mizing underaged Cabana Boys at The Alibi Club, 1806 I-Street, DC.The only two Republicucks who seem to be clean [regarding the pederasty] are Massie &amp; Paul, both hailing from Kentucky [go figure].All the rest of them live in mortal fear of (((Barnea))) releasing the audio &amp; video to the (((Mainstream Media))).That’s why Israhell &amp; Khazaria always get their billions in the spending bills.The Alibi Club.The Cabana Boys.

        Anti-racism and anti-discrimination, my ass. The racism formerly directed at negroes has simply been redirected at whites, and consequently, we are routinely discriminated against in employment, promotion and university admissions. All the Left’s anti-this and anti-that is merely perfumed persiflage designed to mask the suppurating malice and madness that lies at its heart.

        Back in 2020, I left my current company to join another black worship center.  I lasted 4 weeks and luckily I was able to go back to my current employer for a substantial raise as I left on very good terms.  While I was at the new place I attended a large orientation for all of the new hires.  This was during Covid so it was done remotely.   There were about 400 people on this call as the company is pretty large.  The “Chief People Officer” – yes, not making that up – was a fat, angry white lady (usually it’s a FABL (fat, angry black lady).  She had been with the company for 34 years.  It seemed that the St. Floyd incident had given her the opening she’d been waiting for her entire career.  After lecturing the entire room on the wonders of diversity (a room with nearly zero blacks by the way as this was a tech company) she started talking about her view of background checks.  She immediately stated that she was fighting to remove background checks – with a caveat.  These checks would be removed for black candidates ONLY.  She actually said this (with no repercussions of course).  You could see that more than half the room felt good about nodding along.  She then proceeded to tell the audience that this unfairly discriminates against black males because since the police are racist, it unfairly disqualifies blacks from employment opportunities.This is how these people think.  She truly believes that the police are just looking for black males to throw in jail and get into violent confrontations with.  It is amazing.  Also, let me note this – the woman looks exactly how you can imagine she would look like.My wife, who couldn’t help but over hear this nonsense, came into the room and asked me (as we were all muted) – “what happens if they hire a black criminal and he comes into work with a gun and kills 20 people?”.  Good question… what would happen?  For starters, FAWL would not be held responsible.  Instead, she would probably double down.  “We can’t judge the many from the few”.  The families of the victims would probably rush to the TV news to express how it’s not about race.  If the victims were White, the media would be searching under every rock for a reason as to why “they had it coming”.  “Someone called him a ni$$er, what did you expect him to do?”.When i was a kid, my dad would watch the evening news and scream at the TV in frustration over all of the black privilege and the mayhem that they caused.  He watched them ruin his neighborhood when he grew up, and he was a race realist all his life.  I couldn’t understand it at that young age, but he would always say to me – “you’ll understand it when you get to be my age someday”.  Was he ever right…  He was only wrong about when i would realize it, which happened to be a lot sooner.There is absolutely zero reason for blacks and Whites to co-exist.  We are nothing close to the same, we have nothing in common and we don’t want to be around each other.  This is the natural course.  Blacks don’t want to be around Whites either, they only want access to what Whites create because they cannot create it themselves.  My deepest hope is that one day sane people realize this, and build a giant ship capable of transplanting them to another galaxy.  I’m not even sure that would be far enough away for them to less of a pain in the fucking ass.

            It’s unlikely a black guy would come to work and start shooting people.  It’s far more likely the black guy would be unqualified to do the work and the non black employees would be expected to carry the extra workload.  The black guy would end up in HR.

        The ideologically-driven insanity is no joke. Sheetz is just gas station chain. But they’re actually doing it with fucking air traffic controllers. Just last week some “diverse” controllers almost caused a major crash by greenlighting a runway incursion into the path of a departure.
And it’s not the first time.
“DEI” is going to get a LOT of people killed someday, but apparently that is the price our overlords are willing to pay:

            Supposedly, these incidents are recorded and investigated.  A strike goes to the offending controller.  From there there are assigned remedial efforts, which could include suspension. I believe 3 strikes in a period of time and you’re out.  Is this still the case?
It’s one thing to pass alone mediocrities into the tower, another to keep them there.

                If you almost kill hudreds of people, why would you even get a second chance, let alone a third? There should be absolutely no tolerance for grievous error in that industry.

                    The problem—aside from mediocrity—is that I’m hard put to think of an error that does *not* involved real potential for hundreds of lives lost.  Those are the risks—which is why I’d not prefer to see DIE in those professions, but then again I’m preaching the the choir here.

                    Your point is well made, but for ultra-valuable professions, sometimes finesse is required. Although I’m not “in the industry,” I recall the following example: On the surface, if you were a personnel manager or someone else in authority, if you discovered one of your employees had developed a bad drug habit your first instinct might be to at the least fire him, or worse, have him charged with felonies. But what if the employee in question is a pharmacist, an anesthesiologist or some other extremely talented individual? Absent other major faults instead great effort goes into drug rehab or other attempts to rehabilitate a very valuable worker. I would rank an air traffic controller largely at the same professional level.Note that the proposed forbearance does not extend to a fuckup who was under-qualified for a position and had no business being there in the first place. There is a world of difference between trying to rescue Dr. X who previously had a spotless record, and with hiring Shitavious with multiple drug convictions, as a pharmacy assistant. Alas, our society is leaning heavily towards the latter these days.

                        Second chances are fine with appropriate rehabilitation, but you’ve not noted (IMO) a comparable profession/occupation.  Your examples can wind up with a dead patient or so.  ATC incompetence winds up with a full morgue.  The only other immediate occupation I could come up with is a high ranking military officer in charge of troops in battle.  Perhaps another example was the Florida condo collapse a few years ago.  Seems a lot of inspectors “missed the boat” wrt condemning the building.

        The insanity can only continue as long as the plates keep spinning. In other words, because most Americans still enjoy a standard of living that is the envy of the planet, they remain docile in the face of men competing in women’s sports. Prolonged affluence has made them too comfortable and too lazy. And grousing too often substitutes for genuine action because no one wants to sacrifice the easy life for a problem outside the suburbs.But how much longer can the plates keep spinning when the Federal government is printing a trillion dollars of fake money every 100 days? Best not face that “REALITY” or “OH SHIT” might happen and ruin your day at the golf course.We have earned our downfall, and the collapse is the only way that most people can be motivated to act in their self-interest. Luckily for us, the events in Ukraine and Israel are likely to make that happen sooner rather than later.

            “… grousing too often substitutes for genuine action because no one wants to sacrifice the easy life for a problem outside the suburbs.”
Guilty, but what else is left for us?  Voting is meaningless.  I’m no longer employed, so I can’t go out and strike.  Younger cohort is working paycheck to paycheck and probably forced to “look the other way” to survive—especially if with family responsibilities.
Again, we need action items following such well meant critique.

                Action items? I have listed many over the years (here and elsewhere). Get out of the big city, move to a safe haven; preferably a small town or rural area. Disappear into banality and become a nobody that nobody notices. Get fit enough to survive the collapse. Develop skills that may come in handy in the future. Plan for how to make a difference when the time is right; as in, seriously plan in a specific sense. Think outside the box. Use what you know. Emphasize the unexpected. And everything solely within the confines of your cranium.You don’t have to shoot the moon. It doesn’t take much to start a stampede.

                    That is *not* the action item I am referring to. That is a “save your own ass” item.  A meaningful action item would be to the effect of what you can do to change the situation befalling us all.  Your “plan to effect change” when the time comes is “begging the question”, which is what do you propose we do at that time—or even this time.

                        Compsci:First, staying alive is not a vice. We are descended from ancestors that prioritized survival during times of great hardship or difficulty. Second, you kinda need to be alive in order to be proactive in regard to any actions you may wish to take in solving “big” problems. Third, if you do become proactive, its best not to paint a target on your back. Fourth, if your actions are easily predictable, your probability of success may be quite low. Fifth, there is no “singular” kind of action that works everywhere all the time. It’s best to be innovative and unpredictable so as to increase your odds of success. Sixth, whatever action you decide to take should maximize your individual strengths, so everyone will be likely be different, which is a huge advantage. Beyond this is forbidden territory.

                What action would be efficacious? When the king was the body, sure. The world has changed, and the ability to act and affect has changed with it. What can a person do except make an example of himself to be used by the overlords as an example of what not to do? This is not grousing. This is diagnosing a terminal disease and encouraging palliative care.

            Yes. The redefinitions illustrate your point: “equity,” “diversity,” and so forth. The illustrate the punitive nature of the programs. There is no faux idealism involved, only anger and sadism now. It is not sustainable, either. The goal posts will be shifted off the cliff, and that assumes it has not happened yet.

                Exactamundo Jack Dobson. I think Bull Connor and many others explicitly said that this project was about one thing and one thing alone: Revenge.
It is hard to see what is happening and hear everything that is being said and not conclude that those voices were right.

                    It boggles my mind that this is about revenge. (I don’t disagree that it is.) What a bunch of ignorant whining trash clowns. Only about 4% of all Africans taken west from Africa made it to America. The rest went to the Indies or Brazil. We have so many relative to the original influx because the rest (especially Brazil iirc) were simply worked to death before reproducing. Yes, slavery was not just wrong but a stupid importation of the world’s most potent civilization-destroying bioweapon. However, it is an historical fact that slaves in America were treated better than anywhere else and that it was white men who freed them here AND elsewhere, directly and indirectly.Moreover, the numbers take east out of Africa into the Muslim world (and pre-Islam Asia) dwarf those taken west into European ruled areas. (far more for far longer) The reason Muslim Asian areas don’t have infestations of Africans is because they gelded EVERY SINGLE ONE before transportation. The death rate was about 50% b/c this was before antibiotics. I once saw a museum exhibit of all the various tools used for snipping and chopping.Africans should go beg reparations from Medina. Until that day I will pray that a war with Russia ends with nuclear bombs raining down upon our diversity-infested cities like cleansing raindrops in a hurricane.

                        I’d rather not be there at ground zero when the “cleansing” storm starts, thanks. I live in Vancouver, a very nice, clean city perched on the Pacific Ocean in Canada. The Russians might take a look at Canada’s third-largest city and decide it makes a viable target; I’m hoping they wouldn’t but *shrugs hands* who knows with the Russian mind? “A riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.”

                        “ …it is an historical fact that slaves in America were treated better than anywhere else…”Not to apologize for slavery, nor diminish it, but the above is true, but well hidden/overlooked.  The slave Staes were panic stricken and fearful of revolts since the slave population out numbered the slave owners by a high margin in many case.The Savannah Society has any number of documents regarding treatment of slaves and owner responsibilities toward his slaves.  Care and feeding and disciplinary treatment.  Why?  Cause they (Whites with sense) were not about to have their throats slit in the middle of the night because some White slave owning asshole got his slaves riled up through neglect or mistreatment. Makes perfect sense, but poor movie fodder.

            That’s the key to the grift.  It can’t be achieved obviously.  Once Whites are fully removed from any positions of influence, blacks will be far worse off and they will only move on to another group to blame and suck dry.  It is meant to be perpetual.

            Kurt Vonnegut took a stab at that…“THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren’t only equalbefore God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarterthan anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody wasstronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasingvigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.”It will come as no surprise to anyone here that “equality” results in a bloody horror at the hands of the female DEI enforcer.He wrote Harrison Bergeron in 1961…https://ia803002.us.archive.org/25/items/HarrisonBergeron/Harrison%20Bergeron.pdf

                    In theory it’s perfect.
It’s a satire of *critiques* of socialism, a seething MUH FREEDUMBZ post, made in mockery of losers who think they’re “temporarily embarrassed” because of the official ideology of equality.
Harrison Bergeron, not the Starship Troopers movie, is the exemplary “failed satire,” so failed that no one can see it.

It’s my ‘favorite,’ or at least what I believe is closest to present day reality, among the the dystopian future fiction (1984, Brave New World, etc.).

                There was a pretty good Showtime mad for cable adaptation of  “Harrison Bergeron” released in 1995.
It starred Sean Astin as Harrison Bergeron and Christopher Plummer as John Klaxon, the head of the secret elite who runs the United States government behind the scenes and enforces equality on everyone outside the cabal.

            Goal post movement is acutely illustrated with the EPA.  Every time an environmental “contamination” is detected and regulated, there comes a time where that “goal” is met and shortly thereafter the amount of that contaminant allowed is reduced.  This usually follows improved detection and monitoring.There is a city here in AZ that has had its 90 yo water system finally condemned due to arsenic levels.  No mention is made that 4 generations of residents used the water, nor any indication made as to excess disease rates.  Just a simply reduction in allowable arsenic amounts that were tolerated even after the EPA can into existence in the 60’s.The city must now truck in water for residential use.  This of course is a death knell.  No city of any size can long survive without a local water source.

                I’ve noticed something similar in the medical profession. Conditions such as hypertension and high cholesterol are constantly being redefined downward. What was considered perfectly healthy 10 years ago now requires pharmaceutical remedy. Forgive me if I detect the smell of a grift here.

                    Yep, within a year with my doctor, they changed the standard and I was diagnosed with early stage hypertension.  Now the doctor knows I don’t give a crap, so neither does he.As I stated several times before, I recommend (and so do many professions) that when one it told that your “numbers” are out of line with some med board recommendations, you ask “what is the pathology stemming from such numbers” and demand you be tested for that, specifically.  “Treating the numbers” is what blindly attempting to reduce such things as “high blood” pressure is called.Treat the disease (pathology), not the numbers.

        Why make arrest and conviction data available to the public if you’re not allowed to use it?  Why should anyone be forced to hire a convicted thief to handle money?  They are going to get them coming and going.  If they get their way and companies are forced to hire thieves to handle money, the thieves will be able to sue them after they get caught stealing for setting them up for failure.  “They knew or should have known I was going to steal if allowed to handle cash.

            It is already that way wrt employee recommendations.  My old university would not allow us to talk about previous employees to potential employers—except to confirm the employee was employed during the dates listed on his application.  No questions like, “Would you hire this person again?” allowed.  Currently, the university job application has removed the box for criminal history and replaced it with something to the effect of, “Are you under any restrictions that would prevent you from undertaking assigned duties?”Two immediate results:  First, we rarely have a truly open hiring process for high level staff.  In short, someone knows someone who would be a good candidate for the position and they refer them behind the scene.  Second, if a candidate’s references *are* contacted and they hesitate to give meaningful and glowing reviews, but rather our own university’s noncommittal answer, he’s passed over.Mediocrity institutionalized in the name of “fairness”.

            Colbert, your comment made me realize something that is contrary to your request, please don’t take this as an attack.  Warning, it is in complete opposition.A meme showed pagan European types, (Celts, Vikings, etc) saying, “We are what we do in life, and the gods hate the weak,” accompanied by swastikas (which are older than written language, btw), sonnenrads, and symbols of pre-Christian culture.Its apposite panel shows soy man saying, “We are depraved and evil human beings who need the grace of God,” accompanied by a cross, a Jesus icon, and the “ugly jew” motif.Christianity spread wildly in the Europa and Hellenic (white dominant) Middle East.  Why did it become our reigning ideology?Because of the brain structure unique to whites.Guilt or “guilt culture” seems to apply only to white cultures; “shame culture” prevails in nonwhite cultures.  Whenever the subject of ‘guilt vs shame’ comes up, it slyly sidesteps this fact.Guilt, then, is an aspect of frontal neocortex thinking, which is also the prevalent difference in whites, our unique mutation.  Guilt and mercy are readily exploited by the “breeder-brained” nonwhite cultures, who orient around shame.  (They think as women do.)This would also account for why whites are less tribal and exploitably individualistic.  What appears to be ideology is actually differing circuitry.The ability to use language and concepts, then, can remold or rewire that circuitry to a degree.  Viewpoints, orientation, then, are rather plastic.  Unthought assumptions go unquestioned as a base, “how could anyone think otherwise?” because other orientations seem illogical or impossible.  Impossible, that is, until epiphany- one finds God, one loses God, one finds enlightenment, one discovers the dark truth, etc.I don’t see humans as fallen angels, but as risen apes.  That is we were animalistic, but are stages of development, and striving to get better.  Advancing against the bestial world of pain and death, that sentient intelligence itself arose to go beyond those limits, those flaws in the building material.  This is apposite to a static creation from a state of grace, the utopia the Woke want to “return” to.I see the “from the Garden” concept originating as tribal, or Tribal, state propaganda.  “You must submit to us and our God!  We deserve to rule you!” they demanded.  “Why?”, we asked.  It was ultimately a question of authority.Internal authority, as a guilt-based people would have it, that is, “For God, King, and Country” leads to a more effectively organized society.The Chinese model would read “for Emperor (still a male father figure) and Nation”, suited to a nonwhite people more oriented to shame, cruelty, and pain as external enforcement.The Old Testament God, then, was a tyrant culture imposed upon a freethinker culture.  Mulatto Afro-Aryan hybrids (Semitics) imposing what seemed natural to them, shame and punishment, upon the wide-ranging Aryans, who are more tolerant of outgroups, and demonstrably more merciful.Our neocortex tendency to internal guilt, then, rather than external shame, is the exploitable difference.Circuitry-wise, is the dominant language processor the emosocial breeder hindbrain, or the emoneutral frontal cortex?  Status or fairness?  Female pointing or male tinkering?I utterly reject the premise that we Aryans are sinful sinners sinning, deserving unending punishment, for one fundamental reason:  WHITES ARE NOT THE PROBLEM.  WE WERE NEVER THE PROBLEM._______________(This differerence was baked into the cake by a remarkable event: the meteoric destruction of the Fertile Crescent.  The hybrids blamed us for bringing the wrath of the gods, and mankind’s doom.  Genesis is a story about the end of the world, not the beginning of it; Genesis and Job are the survivors of that epic catastrophe trying to figure out why it occurred.Our sciences of invention, the Tree of Knowledge, are anathema to those whose immortality is in their genetic tribe, the Tree of Eternal Life.  The man dies, but his tribe lives forever, following the ancient ways; we upset that balance with our cursed meddling.  Our Aryan ways brought the Wrath, and the loss of the Garden, the unthinking innocent rapine and timelessness of the animal world.)

                I took a political philosophy class for Gen Ed credits in college. The first assigned essay was to compare/contrast The Apology and The Prince. My idea was that the prince is the embodiment of the law— he rules from without— while Socrates was arguing for an internalization of the law. Hence the accusation that he was preaching new gods iirc.That was a long time ago, but I seem to still think along those lines. I’ve said here I think, roughly, the gods are the id and God is the superego. I think this has to do with the shame/guilt thing you’re talking about, and the raising of humanity from its animal nature.The gods ARE— they’re the forces of nature, so to speak. The princes of this world, even if they have an Olympus or a Valhalla. Demons, Satan, Hell, etc.God is off in Heaven, judging, calling you to the the next life, to peace and perfection, to Him— if you make the grade.Does man exalt himself above the animal by virtue, or is he a shameful beast? Is he a holy or guilty spirit?Most pagans never quite made the ascetic leap, because they didn’t deny the world or life. It’s quite a radical step to take. And it’s hard on a person.

                    I would argue that man is an exalted being unique among the stars for his capabilities, his conscience (yes, even that), and his canniness.His conscience is an important feature because it puts the brakes on anti-social actions that would jeopardize the group. This is why it is typical that only leader-figures and sociopaths lack a conscience; because to be a leader takes a natural grit that goes against internal restrictions.Man’s capabilities are ever-expanding, particularly in the technological (teleological) age. As new satellites are lofted in the air bearing internet connectivity, and new genes sequenced for new forms of merged life by companies like Monsanto, it becomes more and more evident that it is WE who are God, and have the power of lightning at our fingertips. By the year 3000 this planet will be irrevocably altered, and the new society that arises will be nothing like the nation-states of the past.

He is not surprised at the results when He does something. He already knows the outcome before He does it.  We, OTOH, will be flabbergasted at the result of our actions.  Besides, our technology is like toys in comparison to either God or nature.  If climate change is totally real and we “cook the planet” and then, just for good measure, we also launch all of the nukes, the Earth will recover to the point like we were never even here.  Those satellites will be under 3 miles of mud and dirt.

I think you get sociopaths in charge when men lack grit.As for the march of technology, somebody has to design it, and somebody has to maintain it. Maybe we get that autonomous tech before people get too degraded, but I’m doubtful we win that race. The higher the tech, the worse the humanity, it seems. Besides, why would it bother keeping us around? Plus, it’s highly capital intensive and speculative— long odds to begin with.

        Off topic but relevant now–WillsI know so many people who deny absolutely the fact that they are going to die, and they make no provision whatsoever to exercise their right of final speech. I try to bring the subject up in a non threatening way but they stick their fingers in their ears and cry La La La. I again try, stating it’s just “prudent planning”, and that this will be their last chance to express remorse, forgiveness, love, protection, support, revenge etc, but they simply refuse to acknowledge it. I then try to ask them what the disposition of their remains should be, or who should get what (not even a post-it note on some of their belongings to say “this goes to so-and-so), once again, fingers in ears and La La La. I can only assume this lack of planning is in some way a twisted revenge on the next of kin, as a last final FU, you figure it out. Thoughts?

                    No it ain’t.  Believe me.  I still remember 40 and how I abused it, or rather took it for granted.  I’m now 70+ and I know the difference.  Yeah, I’m grateful for what I have and can still do at this age, but it’s nothing compared to 40.  😉
As a Boomer, I’ve had it good—and as said many times, certainly better than the overwhelming majority of fellow Boomers, which is why I argue about railing against Boomers all the time.

                You’re right, Lineman. Can’t talk about the reality that cannot be outrun, even the slightest peep of death and the annoyance and anger starts. There’s an old phrase, “Don’t paint the devil on the wall,” and subconsciously that’s what most folks think.Shortly after the Spanish Influenza, sanitation improved, water treatment improved, chlorine was invented, and less people were dying. A few years before, 5 out of 10 kids died by age 5.  Now it’s less than 1 of 10.  So people quit laying out croaked Uncle Henry in the parlor. Saturday Evening Post or Life changed the name of the parlor to the “Living Room.” So we didn’t get to see a croaked Uncle Henry anymore and the kids were protected at all costs from death. And…..here we are!PS: This stuff runs deep. A few years back, I opined to Husband that it’s time to set up a trust and know to whom and how our shit is going. Oh man!! The foot dragging, the anger, the smoke screening. Wowers! So I bought the pedestrian level legal books and how-what-why to do a trust. Learned, got familiar, then let him know that I had set up an appointment with a basic crooked attorney on this date at this time, and be there or be square (said kindly and holding his hand, not the Battling Baxters). It worked! We got the trust.

            Interesting post, as I recently formed a land trust, did a will, medical power of attorney; you get the idea.I have a few children that are good people, who I want to benefit from my efforts. I give as much to them as I can now, as having an inheritance when you’re old and have no use for it, seems silly.At the end of the day, I would trade what my folks (who are as old as dirt, and not in great health), are going to give me, for their final years to be extended and healthy. Watching people who were vigorous and alive in their youth, slowly fade away, is a hell on earth.

                People who are able should in their lifetimes transfer to their children and grandchildren as much as the tax code allows and do so as soon as possible. The species of madness discussed in this post carry a high price tag and the trillions Boomers and X’ers are scheduled to transfer to their families have been noticed. The squatting you see now may become de jure in the near future, too.

            No, refusing to estate plan is not just a Boomer thing. I think the broader charge is accurate; that most people simply don’t want to acknowledge inevitable death or other adversity. Sticking strictly to planning one’s personal wishes, failure to leave any legal means (will, testament, trust, etc.) only makes the job harder for kin or others at some future date. For most people all it would cost is a few hours’ thought and a few hundred bucks at a local estate attorney.I’ve seen first-hand the problems settling an estate can cause and it was probably a fairly minor case. Never mind fights over financial assets; which of the children gets Mom’s antique jewelry collection? The family silver? Dad’s old model railroad collection? It can get downright ugly.

                And there you touch upon the essence of planning for death.  In this State it’s easy to leave things through beneficiaries—equally—including your home.  But as soon as that breaks down, like mom wanting to give special things to daughters and granddaughters, you best get it in writing, or do so before death.
In the end, “failure to plan” is not just “planning to fail”, but possibly planning to *destroy* family cohesiveness and relationship.  Your entire life’s work is in that genotype you’ve shared among family.  They need all the *help* they can get in this crazy world.

        The amazing thing about this Sheetz case is that the Sheetz Family isn’t even particularly political. You would think this would be a standard example of “punishing enemies”. But these folks have made only very modest contributions (by billionaire standards) to various (mostly, but including Fetterman) GOP candidates in recent years and keep a low profile in general.So we have now entered Phase 2 of the regulatory racket wherein businesses have to pay proactively for protection. They’re past punishing enemies and are moving into standard mob tactics.If the government can tell businesses whom to hire based on ridiculous standards like those of the Sheetz case, any business can be harassed into submission. Perhaps Sheetz can fend off this suit, but other smaller businesses would be crushed by such an expensive suit.

            The people who run these government agencies are always in need of targets to justify their existence.  There also seems to be a high number of true believers in the “ban the box” movement.  They believe that the main reason these criminals return to a life of crime is lack of opportunity for “good jobs.”  If Quantrell was given a job that paid well with important responsibilities he would never commit another crime.They also believe drug dealing is most non violent, and the only difference between a dealer and the guy running a hardware store or hamburger stand is the products being sold.  You can’t reason with this insanity.

                The key is here to understand the nature of crime and punishment.  I do not profess to be an expert, but much of the problem seems to me to be a general misunderstanding of the process (finality) of punishment.
We seem to think that a prison term  (if that, most get probation) is the entirety of the punishment and that folks who get out of jail *deserve* to be treated like everyone else.  Really?
That line of reasoning would allow pedophiles back into grade school classrooms.

                    Just so. It’s not as if incarceration somehow magically expunges the character flaw that precipitated said incarceration.
If you don’t want a crime to hang over you for the rest of your life, don’t do the crime.
PS–Obviously, a single crime committed decades ago in one’s youth shouldn’t impose the same sort of disability as recent recidivism.

For those, there is expungement of the youthful crime.  I’d like to see this promoted and clarified more so.

            Clearly they pissed off somebody. Because the “disparate impact” that is cited is a 14.5% rejection rate for negros due to criminal records, vs an 8.5% rejection rate for whites due to criminal records. Obviously the regime could have found a business where that gap is much larger. Very easily, I would think. But they went after this one.

        This recent dust up in the equalitarian crusade is yet another sign that we’re finally moving past the 20th century.The original Civil Right movement with its push for equality uber alles could work in an 85% white country. We could pretend that blacks were equally capable because whites didn’t have to give up too much to accommodate a relatively small number of blacks. (Actually, whites gave up a lot, but it was doable.) Now, with young whites down to 60% of the population, the numbers don’t add up.Also, back then, blacks were no threat to the elite. Blacks were an incredible physical threat to working class and poor whites but who cares about them. The upper levels of society were just Jews and WASPs trashing on non-elite whites for being terrible people.Now, with the arrival of Asians, Indians, a few smart Muslims, there are other voices applying the anti-racism dogma and they’re pointing it at Jews and elite whites.The silliness of the everyone is equal and anti-racism cult could only exist in the bubble of the late 20th century. Now that they were moving into the 21st century, it will collapse in practice, though people will still mouth its canon.

It’s a great shame. Through the early to mid 1900s, whites were well known for reprisal attacks on black communities when “bruthas got out-a-line”.
A shame, indeed.

            “Now, with young whites down to 60% of the population, the numbers don’t add up.”
Under 50%.  IIRC, it was some time around 2010 that White births dropped below 50%.  But that’s just births. That doesn’t include all the young people invading the US.  I’m pretty sure Gen-Z is majority non-white.
“Now that they were moving into the 21st century, it will collapse in practice, though people will still mouth its canon.”
I think it will keep going in such a way that justifies discriminating against Whites.  Our new diverse overlords are being conditioned to absolutely hate White people.

                Yes, the Civil Rights facade is coming down. It was always a hate whitey crusade. And they won. Now, it’s more of an apartheid system of discrimination against whites, though the opposite in terms of segregation, i.e., whites are forced to live around non-whites as opposed to whites not allowing non-whites to live around whites.The question is whether whites will ever wake up. So far, no great sign of it, though there are green shoots. Whites have noticed that they’re being discriminated against but instead of fighting back as a group either through forming white political organization or creating their own communities, they’re starting to demand that non-whites adhere to colorblindness, aka Rufo.It’s when that has failed that we’ll see if whites do anything. Personally, I have my doubts for 80% of whites, but I’m hoping the rest will move on from their colorblind dream.

                    Agreed.I failed to tie up my point in an earlier reply, but something happened last week that gives a clue as to where this is heading. A typical low IQ, emotional Sub-Saharan imbecile in Congress, Jasmine Crockett, was ridiculed last week when she suggested blacks not pay taxes as a form of reparations. Attention should be paid since she is far too stupid not to say the quiet part aloud. Also note this concept has been floated in California and may have become law already in San Francisco.No, blacks don’t pay very much in taxes, but whites do and there is an incredibly strong possibility that taxes in the near-future will be race-based and fully and transparently will transform from revenue collection to punitive action. Once that starts, to quote a certain German cartoon villain, you will own nothing.I think that will be the moment that the twenty percent or so you mentioned who can be will be redpilled. Unlike a draft, which if resisted would require violent measures to implement, taxes can be enforced via liens, bank seizures, and other initially passive methods. Even those who slept through all the previous outrages will realize what that represents.“PAY” probably will be the new “DEI.”This possibility at least is non-violent for the most part, and may be the least outrageous policy implemented against whites in the near future. It will get ugly but again is not sustainable.

                    Citizen:  Only when a hardened rump remains will Whites fight back as a group, by which time it will probably be too little and too late.  Let’s imagine the dubious proposition that AINO survives in its current form (although not substance) another 25 years.  Between Silent and Boomer deaths, the tiny White/White birth rate, increasing miscegenation and immigration, plus the larger non-White birth rate, Whites of European Christian ancestry will be down to perhaps 30% of the population, compared to today’s approximately 55% (officially 57.9, minus Jews, Persians, Lebanese, various ‘whiter’ Latinos and subcontinentals).  More anti-White legislation, more overt and punitive anti-White discrimination in hiring, education, etc.Almost all of the older true believers in anti-racism and egalitarianism will be dead.  Increasing numbers of the younger true believers will be dead  or no longer White from their own naivete, crime, and miscegenation.  Those younger Whites who internalized and accepted the White self-hatred will be dead of drugs and despair.Those Whites still around will be increasingly forced into a corner – obviously targeted for legal and de facto extermination.  That’s when the minority who are determined and tough enough will genuinely tribe up and attempt to fight back.  I don’t know what good it will do at that point, but that’s the best prognosis I see based on today’s reality.

                        I’m not quite as blackpilled as you because the enemy is impulsive and erratic and as a direct result many whites have started to self-segregate and fragment physically and mentally from the larger society. Backs have been forced against the wall earlier than was planned. That aside, your analysis is generally the outline of what will happen even if not as fatally as you suggest. The pockets of resistance will be under constant siege but over time that cannot be sustained.The main problem at the moment largely is a white and female one. If that could be remedied in short order, and I don’t think it will be, even my slightly less blackpilled scenario might not have to play out.

                        “ Only when a hardened rump remains will Whites fight back as a group,…”
No rebuttal here, but I would point out that Blacks in this country have never exceed 13% of the population.  Other aspects of Black rise to ascendency aside, I’d say a hard core group of Whites—especially at 30%—can recover a reasonable status among warring groups of minorities within this clown world.

                        I believe the “true believer” Whites is a far smaller number than it appears.  All those Kumbaya, “can’t we all just get along” Boomers and silents created the concept of White flight.  Granted, this was cowardice and not in any way noble, but it did reveal their true preferences.  Even some of the most died in the wool egalitarians who would just LOVE to have a nice African American couple sit next to them in church (or wait on them in McDonald’s) don’t want them as next door neighbors.   One is an abstraction and easy to accept and one is more concrete with real life consequences.  How many White parents moved to the suburbs when their kids came home crying every day after being tortured in integrated public schools?  The rich SJWs in Connecticut and New Hampshire have their BLM flags very far away from the nearest black.  They constantly complain about the lack of diversity, but they would never consider moving to a “diverse” neighborhood.There’s a Colin Flaherty video on my youtube account of an actual “true believer.”  He moved his nice young White family into the middle of a black neighborhood in Detroit.  They stole his central air unit!  IIRC, he said I guess they needed it more than me.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5cSyD3FOfUColin also talked about some reporter that moved his family into the middle of the ghetto.  He then used his family as an ongoing story for his paper.  I think he eventually moved as his kids got a bit older (like in their early teens). Colin is truly missed.

                    That is the great question, whether Whites will wake up.  Pleading for colorblindness isn’t the answer, since the Third World pouring in has no interest or really, no concept of it.  The only answer for Whites is to become, well, “racist.” (GASP)  That’s the way it works in multiracial societies.

            The silliness of the everyone is equal and anti-racism cult could only exist in the bubble of the late 20th century.What? The first Civil Rights Act was passed in 1874. The Supremes upheld the destruction of property rights in the Civil Rights Cases (1883), imagining that discrimination in taverns, inns, boarding houses, etc., violated the 14th Amendment. And, of course,Plessy v. Ferguson(1894) gave us “separate but equal.”I’m somewhat sympathetic to the argument that legislative history of the 14th Amendment (1868) strongly suggests it was intended to apply only to government discrimination, yet most of the chowderheads who voted for it were still alive, many still in office when the Civil Rights Act did exactly what they promised it would never do.This equality obsession was hardly a late 20th century affectation. By the time ofBrown, civil rights as we know them were already set in stone.

They believe what they believe because everyone they know believes it.This is so true. There was a good clip of frodi and mark Weber  commenting on the death of Norman Lear. They demonstrate how tv shows decidedly sealed the new ideology in the 70s and the 80s by making free association low class. Making it a status thing not a “facts and logic thing” is an important lesson for our side

            That’s true. All the social engineering was built around making the new thing way cooler than the old thing. They overplayed their hand though. The “woke” movement that emerged out of the later Obama years was and is incredibly cringe and lame. It is also pushed by the least likable and most dysgenic mutants imaginable. It wouldn’t surprise me if a large contingent of dissident zoomers are that way just because they were tired of seeing annoying school administrators putting up pride flags in their school. Then they go online and see people calling each other gamer words and it’s funny *because* the obnoxious schoolmarms are so overbearing about it.

            “They believe what they believe because everyone they know believes it.”
I think there is some truth to this. People do tend to take on their peer’s beliefs.  But I think it’s bigger than that.  They believe what they believe because they’ve been conditioned to believe that for all of their lives.  Their beliefs were taught to them as children and then reinforced in many different ways throughout their lives.  The simple act of reading the daily paper is a daily injection of SJW beliefs.

            Gespenst:  Not just Bank for non Americans.  John Eastman, who was disbarred over claims he denied the integrity of the immaculate 2020 election, was also debanked by BOA.  And then the grand patriot poobahs at USAA also notified Eastman they were closing his accounts.Of course libertardians and cuckservatards will claim that is a company’s right – to cease to do business with anyone – under the fantasy mists of freedom of association and private property.  But the reality of modern life is that – even before the ballyhooed CBDC has been put in place – having access to banking is a necessity of life.  Even if you want and attempt to live dealing mostly in cash, it just isn’t possible to pay all bills that way, particularly for people with businesses and people living in an urban or suburban environment.And as a customer of USAA since the mid 1980s, it is in no way the same company it was way back then.  It now accepts almost anyone with the most tenuous connection to the military, and said military is officially woke and demographically massively non-White.  So too (woke and non-White) is USAA.  Of course, all the other insurance companies suck too, but just make note of companies to avoid if possible.

                Banking is a utility, no different from water, power, etc.  I guess the “shocking” thing isn’t that banking has been pulled from regime enemies, but that they haven’t got around to the other utilities as well.

                        Yep.  Here in Tucson, the water/sewer bill has become so high—via rate increases by County and City—that there is a program to give you your first two units of water per month, free.  This of course for low income families.  The rest of us pay exponentially expanding rates as we use *too much* water.  Of course, our exponential rates pay for their water.  Additionally, the water company is City owned and they have added a penalty for supplying water outside the City.  Thus increasing the charges even more. Why? because they can.  As the mayor said, don’t like it, vote for City annexation.  🙁

                    In defense of my forebears, it actually wasn’t easily won. The South’s Ruling Class collaborated and used economic sanction and financial ruin against their inferiors, yet it still took fifteen-plus years for them to be able to declare victory (1978 or thereabouts). It was called “mass resistance” for a reason.
The methods used then are the template used today: firings, deplatforming, economic sanctions, and so forth. People are softer now, of course, but it isn’t a given they can be quickly brought to heel.

            The simple story that most of us read at a young age of The Emperor Has No Clothes applies to so much of what we are seeing today… History sometimes doesn’t repeat but it always rhymes…

                People will continue to pretend to believe in the Civil Rights dogma, but it’s coming down. Non-whites and Jews and use it as a cudgel against whites, but whites aren’t in charge anymore as lots of people are learning after Oct. 7.Once the ridiculous anti-racism stuff was aimed the people really in power – Jews – it was shot down immediately. The same is true when the anti-racism goes after any group that’s not white. Asians don’t accept or care about being called racism. Neither do Indians. Blacks certainly don’t care.The whole Civil Right’s anti-racism crusade was just an attack against whites. Well, the war is over. Whites lost. Now, the Hate Whitey coalition is trying to figure what to do next. Same with whites.Welcome to the 21st century.

                    “Once the ridiculous anti-racism stuff was aimed the people really in power – Jews – it was shot down immediately.”Not so fast; Since Oct. 7 “Anti-Semites” have been protesting. A lot. Columbia U. is only the most recent example. Of course, this is mostly directed against Israel. But surely the “civil rights” of a minority (the Palestinians) figure prominently in the ire the “Anti-Semites” feel.I suspect that American Jews are feeling the heat too. “Shot down” maybe, but we aren’t talking a one-off like that idiot Kanye West’s comments in late 2022. The old “We’re being persecuted again” shtick doesn’t work as well when your countrymen have racked up a body count in the (reported!) tens of thousands in their reprisal to the initial attack. No matter how justified Israel’s response may be, it’s bad optics all around.

        They look like cult membersWhat never sat right with me for the longest time was that every politician always has an official portrait of them smiling with teeth whiter than white.  Why is that the look?  Are they saying, hey I am a person you can like, I have a nice smile, a friend you can trust.  I go to the dentist regularly !!No.  I think people who smile all the time are either trying to sell me something or have empty skulls.  I’d rather see a stern unsmiling and serious person in the political ranks.Now the smiles are like you see with those cult members.  They went from generic high school yearbook smiles to those crazy smiles with the oogly boogly eyes.  Joni Ernst is a case study in this.  She went full on cult member crazy.I have to surmise that government is now their religion.  They worship it.  The congress members waving around Ukraine flags the other day, those are not normal people.  They’re all sharing in something weird.

        I’m sorry to spoil everybody’s doom and gloom, but this is not much of a case and I don’t think Sheetz will be losing any sleep over this. EEOC filings are usually merely procedural, and if youread the actual filing(as I have), you’ll see that this one is pretty anodyne.The filing alleges not that Sheetz discriminated based on race. That claim is only found within the “additional averments” section of the suit. The issue here is that Sheetz’s candidate rejection process lacks objectivity and transparency, or a means of redress for job candidates who are rejected.In the end, it will be fairly easy for Sheetz to prove that the candidates were rejected with cause. They will need to streamline their process and perhaps pay a small fine, but other than that, this is a nothing-burger.

It will not be easy, it will take time and money that the business could better spend on doing business. If the Regime wants to make it really difficult, it will be really difficult.

                That is the problem. I deal with men in their 50s and 60s everyday. They still believe that the higher levels of the judiciary are staffed by people like them who will put a stop to lower court and administrative madness. They believe that corporate boards are still filled with white guys forced to “go along” with woke propaganda for the time being. All will return to normal eventually; the “crazies” always get put in their place and the pendulum swings back to sanity.Nothing’s changing until that way of thinking is gone, either by way of age (generational Normalcy Bias disappearance) or events.

                    The imposition of the Con itself is an example of a few people doing whatever they wanted, and the deceit is right out in the open. Ask your husband, since he may still be a believer, to read the preamble and Art. VII with a careful eye.The preamble pretends to be the act of willing beings called “the People”, but fewer than 1/2 of the people had anything to do with it.The same lie carries also a nasty assumption: Absolutely everyone is authorized to participate when an alleged supreme law is declared and adopted. If, one day, fourteen year olds are allowed to vote, the preamble will have something to do with it.A7 is arguably as bad. It presumes its own legitimacy before “Ratification”. Well, some people in Rhode Island were having none if it back in 1788. They ignored the opinion about a convention and in March or so put the new Con to referendum among the electorate. Fewer than 10% voted for it, but of course the populist imperialists didn’t give up.

I was just noting that letting go of his belief in the rule of law was far more difficult for him than anything else – he was already fully based about race, the JQ, and even moving (however slowly) away from his fervent belief in the magic of the ‘free market’ (although we still argue about that).

                The original claims are more than 8 years old and the EEOC made repeated efforts to resolve the claims outside of the litigation process. It was Sheetz that did not provide the requested documentation.
But as I said, it’s all procedure. Very, very little will come of this.

That’s why this whole shitstorm keeps going so long as the people who think this way are above the grass.
The nerve of those twits and their “guilty until you provide evidence to the contrary.” And considering that most of the time, whatever you submit can be used to make a case against you for some other obscure regulation…

                        The Sheetz case does seem to be symbolic persecution, not unlike the young man who did the “Text your vote for Hillary” in 2016 that was obviously a joke but come January 2021 the Justice Department took it up itself to prosecute him under some obscure civil rights charge. He is now serving a term in prison.
At the risk of belaboring the obvious, this is not justice in any sense of the meaning; it’s punitive payback to political enemies. Welcome to the third world, now in your Federal government.

                One hundred percent. The funniest part of the dust-up over the warrantless FISA spying was the belief that the law was an impediment to federal police agencies. People, geez.

                The other night, I was talking to my 70-something father about the current state of affairs. He agreed that Trump was likely going to be convicted in several or all of these state-run show trials.He also agreed that there wasn’t a dime’s worth of difference between the two political parties and even agreed with me that they were two heads of the same beast.But when I dared suggest that continued participation in the system such as voting was an endorsement of it, he got mad. He told me it was my civic duty to vote and if I didn’t, I’d have no ability to complain.I realized that my father and many of his generation are unable to cross what Z calls the “great divide.” They can’t accept that the system they believed in for decades, much as I did, can not be reformed and must be replaced. He also said a revolution would be “bad for the country.”My question was simple: The people in charge hate us. They’re not us. They seek our immiseration and eventual elimination. So why not get rid of those people and replace them with people who act in our best interests? He had no answer for that, except a civil war would be awful (true).I use the analogy of a recent filing I got. My dentist told me that I could probably go without a filling, but that I’d likely have to come back and get a bigger one because it’d like deteriorate. It was either get a little filling now or get a bigger, more painful one later.

            The curious thing is Chick-fil-a knew this was coming.Before 2020, it was the huwhitest, most efficient fast-food place. I was struck by how much better an experience going to CFA was than, say Burker King. In fact CFA’s popularity was probably due to its white Christian vibe…definitely not the chicken, which was overrated.Then George Floyd (Happy St. George’s Day, by the way, to the Brits who care about such old fashioned things) died and CFA got religion, so to speak, over who the REAL trinity is…DEI. So now CFA is only a little better than Burker King, maybe, and its chicken is still overrated.But Kudos for Boomer Christians for seeing the writing on the wall before Sheetz did. I would expect more lawsuits against companies that seem like they’re hiring competent people.

                Once King Cuck Cathey (CFA’s CEO or whatever) said whites should be washing the feet of nuggras in the aftermath of the Passion of the Floyd, I consigned CFA to Hell and I haven’t darkened the door of one since. Few other whites seem to have been similarly bothered, unfortunately.

            Yes, it may be a nothing burger wrt Sheetz, but not to others.  The aspect of an avenue for redress as one of the processes needed in restructuring of hiring procedure is fraught with danger.
For example, down the line we may see more and more decisions made —either administratively or by the courts—that conviction of one type of crime or another does not quality for dismissal of the applicant for any particular employment opportunity at Sheetz.  Does Sheetz now have to examine the details of each applicants conviction record to justify their rejection decision?

        The key to all of this is that the Ruling Class believes something. Behind that belief is a year-zero belief that the world was a dark and evil void until the great light of Progressivism was shown. Before that beacon that we must move toward shown evil and badness and ignorance stood in its path. So, we must level it all so that the light can shine through. Of course, the Calvinists and those people chosen by God to shine his light through them will lead the way with machetes, wrecking balls and explosives – all packaged as benevolent tools neatly removing evil to unblock the light and the path toward it.That belief is sustained in a void. Ironically a void and darkness of total ignorance. The bad old world of the dark was never dark. The source of their darkness is the caricatured and cartoon deconstructed view of the past that cast the light of the good, true and beautiful into darkness – the void and darkness of their hearts and minds.Perhaps the cowardice and inability to stand up to these lunatics is explained by the absence of Christianity with conviction. There once were institutions and men who ran them who would renounce this ignorance and evil as pure evil and demand that it be cast out and the sinners repent. That moral authority is gone, leveled by the void of the do-gooders and the money machine that pays them to continue leveling.

            Btw, this is playing out pretty close to home. Had to listen to a story yesterday about a daughter away at college, (with the middle-America deplorables she hated when in the ritzy &gt; 1% burb, but now loves them when living with them), whose Yale attending high school friend was punched in the face just for being Jewish. There was some on-campus rally that they were going to when the reality of decades of leveling, celebrating diversity and Noel Saul Ignatiev’s anti-whiteness and Chomsky’s anti-colonialism served up some own goals.Of course the explanation and lesson learned for them is that you must do more to stamp out hate and eliminate meanies. It will never dawn on them that they have created this gollum and reality dictates the project made with rainbow, sunshine and unicorn farts will only lead to more of this and in turn more repression and overt tyranny.Those who propose the only viable solution, peaceful separation, are horrible meany-meany-mean mean faces led on by the ghost of the Austrian painter looming behind every shadow and permeate in all acts of random unexplained hate.That said, it is grimly entertaining to see the bewilderment and total inability to do sense-making in the face of this. Bad things happen because bad is everywhere and so you must deconstruct all human beings and scour the bad out of them.This will only get more prevalent as the succeeding generations of hyper-ignoramuses fill the void of those who taught them. Do not despair. It is in this total inability to recognize and do proper sense making that those grounded in reality can make headway. It will take generations but those who prepare their progeny properly the opportunity for reclamation and renewal will arrive.

I think commenterSeverianused to say something like “if you want imagine what Christianity is today, think of that hippie Jesus statue from the filmDogma“. Seems bang-on to me.To great a focus on unrelenting acceptance and ‘altruism’. Not any focus on resisting Evil or bettering yourself and battling your sins; or, for that matter, on what Christ does indeedofferhis disciples.For goodness sake, just wear a Ukraine lapel pin and put a BLM sign in your garden – that’ll have you golden for years!Lord have mercy.

        It wasn’t until later in my life when i realized that o was looking at things through ideology and not reality. Ideology has been drilled into us. I have come around and now I just want to see things function correctly i dont care what ideology is behind it. Pete Quinnones brought up the guy who is president of El Salvador as an example, apparently he came out of the left in that nation but once he got in office he decided to start arresting anyone with a gang symbol, basically he just wanted to make El Salvador work properly. We need a party called the Make things function correctly party and forget about ideology. I dont care if the person making things work has left leaning or right leaning views.Just save us from the  collapse.

                Yep. By AINO standards, El Salvador collapsed over 40 years ago. Of course, whether or not it ever attained a sufficient level of development, from which something you could call collapse could have been said to happen, is a valid question.

                Lineman:  Most people still cannot face what is truly happening now and what will inevitably follow in the near future.  They still want someone else to come save the day for them.  Knowing you are on your own and can depend on no one else to come save you is too stark a truth for most modern Americans to accept.I was reading some of yesterday’s comments to my husband, and we agreed that counting on systemic collapse within a year – while possible – is highly unlikely.  But then we read people imaging what AINO will be like in 30-40 years and we just laugh.  Anything is possible, of course, and the future is unknown to us, but we give it 10-15 years at the outside.  We expect big and small bad changes far sooner, and have reordered our lives accordingly.

                    “and we agreed that counting on systemic collapse within a year – while possible – is highly unlikely.”I argued yesterday that it was not only possible, but likely. Regardless, when it happens, it will happen suddenly, like a phase change. Why I believe it will happen within a year is primarily the presidential election, which will require redoubled efforts on the part of the PTB to swindle the public about “Our Democracy”. I think the Red states will have to organize against the Federal government on this matter. If they don’t then the demoralization will have been proved complete and so yes, at that point it will take 10-15 years to bring it to the tipping point.

            You are making the assumption that things are not working properly.I suspect everything is going as planned for the WEF globo-anarchy types. They have to break a few eggs for the imagined new utopian future. The reality that their ideology is flawed and will fail is outside of their imaginaions.What we have is their plan. Divide, destroy, rebuild as it should be. The true believers are fanatics and possibly insane. But they have a plan. They lack the ability to evaluatethe risks associated with the unintended consequences. They have been implementing this plan for 60 years. They will not stop.

            In “The Art of the Good Life” author Rolf Dobelli writes about what he calls the dogma trap: most people readily offer up opinions on topics that they hardly know anything about (“the knowledge illusion”).“When this inclination to toe the party line spreads beyond individual topics and starts constituting a whole worldview, it can spell disaster. That’s when we start talking about ideologies. Ideologies are party lines raised to the power of ten, and they come with a pre-packaged set of opinions.Ideologies are highly dangerous. Their effect on the brain is like a high-voltage current, causing an array of rash decisions and blowing all kinds of fuses. It’s like, for example, when young European men with a university education swear loyalty to ISIS and fight to reintroduce the medieval teachings of Islam.Avoid ideologies and dogmas at all cost—especially if you’re sympathetic to them. Ideologies are guaranteed to be wrong. They narrow your worldview and prompt you to make appalling decisions. I don’t know of a single dogmatist with anything approaching a good life.”

        “This is why we have a ruling class that seems to be at war with not just the culture and traditions of America but at war with reality itself.”This gets to it. America comes out of the Anglo tradition, which seems a hybrid thing, hierarchical yet egalitarian. The UK has a king, but his power isn’t absolute, a man’s home is his castle, etc.Protestantism, yes, but how does a Gentile worship the Hebrew national god? Must be the universal God, or we must be Hebrews!All men are created equal? Even those of a different nation and culture? Well, there must be a universal culture from the universal God, we must all be the same human race! We must deny the world and ourselves in the pursuit of the ideal— progress! Protestants take this stuff literally.Much is made about the hypocrisy of the Founders, but maybe they still had that hybrid Anglo point of view. Things like equality and progress would look a lot different today if America was still American. Some say African slavery is America’s original sin, but it was the problem of what to do with outsiders in a society that wasn’t rigidly hierarchical. Either you become more hierarchical, or you have to figure out how to be even more egalitarian. Well, we see where that’s gotten us!Trying to do the impossible is always a losing proposition. As some point you have to realize and admit it’s impossible before you kill yourself in the effort.

To me, it was a problem of what to do with Africans period. Africans cannot be assimilated into White society at any successful rate. To me, there have been  5 (maybe 6) periods in American history.First there was the indentured servitude period. When after a generation or two whites figured out it couldn’t work, they instituted slavery, or period two. This worked until Emancipation and Reconstruction, period three, only lasting 12 years. In 1877, with the election of Hayes, Reconstruction ended and a period of experimentation began that lasted until about 1947 with theShelley vs. Kraemerdecision (period four.) That began period five, or the Civil Rights era. Some might argue that a period six began with Obama and the doctrine of “disparate impact.”How long period six lasts is anyone’s guess, but what is going to follow, that’s the real question.

                Maybe I am being nice lol. You bring up something interesting. As I understand it, African slavery took off because indentured whites couldn’t handle the heat and sun of the lower latitudes. This also made blacks more valuable than whites, which I’d imagine led to the institution of slavery as much as anything else. If all that is true, it was an utterly practical, dollars-and-cents decision. Pirate operation 1.0, still screwing up nation and its ideals, whatever version it is today.

        “This is why we have a ruling class that seems to be at war with not just the culture and traditions of America but at war with reality itself. The American ruling elite has evolved to serve the needs of the civil rights revolution and what Professor Merriam calls the antiracist constitution. Happening as it has over generations, the people in it are unable to see that they are operating within an ideological framework. They believe what they believe because everyone they know believes it.”The US upper class and upper middle class is at a remove of many levels of separation from gritty reality. This is not just to do with the domestic reality of race differences but also with foreign and military policy. Late empire has put blinkers on their eyes. The collapse of empire will wipe out most of these people and the few who do make it will have to rapidly and painfully change their worldview so that it’s more in consonance with the realities the rest of us face every day.As to where this nonsense is emanating from, the motive force so to speak, it’s coming from the Tribe comfortably ensconced in academia, media, and law, aided and abetted by deluded white liberals.

        Because everyone’s equal, coming soon will be the federal leviathan preventing companies from moving their grocery and pharmacy stores out of black and latino areas.  The American taxpayer will just have to make up the difference in the losses due to rampant theft in those areas.

        Outside of entertainment and a couple of sports, blacks have brought nothing to the table that America couldn’t have done without – and we could have done without those as well.  Civil rights were supposedly going to free the black population to be the best they could be, on par with Whites – instead, it unleashed the jungle on American society and culture.  This ant-racism cult is driving us over the cliff – separation of some sort will be the only answer. – not only from pocs, but the zombie Whites who lap that crap up.

            I think the claims about unleashing black potential were always a side hustle, never really the point of the civil rights crusade. The real point was what all crusades are about and that is redemption. The fully open society is not a practical goal but a spiritual one. The practical benefits to Jews, for example, are secondary, which is why the elites are struggling with the anti-Zionist protests on campus. Ideologically, the anti-Zionists are on firmer ground. That is why the schools are not quickly cracking down on these protests, despite the demands from their wealthy Jewish donors.

                Exactly.  It’s most sad.  Good looks fade with time, especially poignant when you consider there’s always a younger follow on generation you are competing with.

One of the more interesting things about the US is that it provides the most thorough, well-documented history of black-white race relations that there has ever been. And this has (or had, at least) given people a certain understanding of black limits.I suspect that there were many good-intentioned people pushing that Civil Rights stuff; but I’d be 100% sure there were huge numbers of “pushers” who saw it as the ultimate reparation – a punishment for whites.

                OrangeFrog:  That’s exactly what is was intended as – a punishment for Whites who didn’t immediately and wholeheartedly welcome Moishe into the bank and the country club.  The Jews founded all the supposedly black civil rights organizations.  They were the lawyers and accountants for all the activists, back then just as today.  Some of them got high on their own supply and married and bred with them.And now, when I look at what’s happening on campuses, I laugh.  I have no sympathy for the Palestinians – not my people, not my problem.  No way do I want them here.  Of course the Jewish insistence on open borders and endless immigration (initially to get all their cousins here and later to ensure they were just one variety among many and supposedly wouldn’t stick out or be noticed) is why the Palestinians and Somalians are here.And all the turmoil at colleges in the late 1960s and 1970s was initiated and caused by the same Jews – utilizing black violence once again – to challenge White order and social mores and hierarchy as immoral and evil.  And now that those ‘student demonstrators’ are all older, wealthier, and have their own kids and grandkids at the colleges, they are incensed by the hatred and chaos they themselves sowed the seeds of.  They are still being ‘noticed ‘ – by their adopted and imported pets – and their claim to be simultaneously special and equal, wealthy and disadvantaged – is no longer working.Well, as far as I’m concerned, it’s past time for Sampson to pull down the columns and crash the whole place.  I hate both sides.  I want them all gone – from what used to be my country, from the continent, and from the earth overall.  Both sides have derided and destroyed all that is good and beautiful and true, and both sides need to get what they’ve earned – in spades and with extreme prejudice.

                    Speaking of Samson – people say get rid of the blaques, and the problem is solved.  But the blaques are merely one (of many) instruments utilized by another group to push its interests.

        From the interview listed:&gt;  And in those isolated instances in which the federal government would not have the authority to go after localized discrimination, private forces and local authorities would be recruited to pick up the slack. That is how our system was designed to work.These guys talk a tough game, but always buckle. What he’s basically saying is for the federal government to strong-arm local authorities to do what they want. This is arguably worse than what we have now. He might think this is a tactical thing to make what he is saying easier to sell, but we’re far beyond that now. He has to accept that getting freedom of association back means tearing apart everything done in the last 60 years.It’s nice this is a very intelligent interview, which is refreshing to read for once.

        “Racism” (only from whites ti nonwhites) is the greatest sin in the current orthodoxy. Therefore it is hard to be anymore dissident than to reject the power of the accusation “racist” because it means to dissent against their brain plagues. The term racist must entirely lose its power

            It has gone on to morph into other forms.  For example, there is now racist math, birds, sunlight – you name it.  Every single shortcoming of feral blacks can be explained away by racism – if not from evil Whites then God himself.

            All manner of men believe in this concept that is less than a hundred years old: racism From high power lawyers and businessmen to rednecks. It’s incredible. I have an American moral theology manual for Catholic priests from the 1950s that not only makes no mention of the r word, but  lists the prohibitions of marrying different races in different states, so that the priest doesn’t accidentally go against miscegenation laws, laws that now even the most conservative of normies would  say is racist to the core. How is that possible?There is no way to spin this as a new sin. There’s no way to find it in any cohesive and consistent way through the centuries.We have been hooked as my gramma use to say

        I agree completely with Zman’s well-thought-out position, and would like to pose the rhetorical question: what makes it all possible? What is the root of the evil?The answer is television.TV got going around 1950 in New York City and from the beginning it was clear that it was something special. When actors on the very local TV programs would walk down Manhattan streets, apartment windows would rattle up and dwellers would have conversations with the actors as if they were friends.That is what television has evolved into: the friendship box turned on in your home 30 hours a week … whispering to you insidiously all the while.Take the 1970s show “All In The Family.” The main character is Archie Bunker and he is meant to be laughed at. He is framed as a neanderthal in a slick new age. Anyone like Archie — and Nixon supported the character — TV painted as a loser or a fool.Or take late 1980s “Murphy Brown.” When the hard-hitting grrl Murphy decides to have a baby without a father, Vice-president Quayle blows up in criticism. But he is just sucked down into a whirlpool of mockery, re-affirming the dominating strength of TV.The examples are countless. Liberal writers, leading you by the nose with the carrot of easy entertainment, prep you for the Great Demographic Replacement currently underway. Turn off the tube and call a friend over for a game of Risk. It’s more fun/social, and will spare you the constant brainwashing.— Xloveli (www.dark.sport.blog)

            With the narrow, three-network choices on TV then, it’s not surprising that Boomers, who grew up on a steady, unrelenting stream of J-programming, generally have a mindset that’s ossified and hard to budge.The internet busted things wide open.  Not as wide open as we’d like, but compared to 1972, it’s vastly different.  The mainstream channels like Netflix, Showtime, CNN, etc are still churning out the egalitarian views, but outside of that, opposing voices are growing.I recently found out there are apps you can add to Roku, both Odysee and Rumble, making it easy to view dissident content on your TV, including the Zman Power Hour.  Now you can confuse boomer friends and family who believe “if it comes from your TV, it’s the truth.”

                But the rot has spread beyond the Boomers to all the generations and is only cascading, metastasizing. TV now sets the standard for the entire culture. The liberal writers have grown like a swarm and migrated to cable and streaming. It’s an absolutely devastating, absolutely effective loop.

            Let’s be mindful of recency bias. The Protestors’ egalitarianism metastisized into a new, aggressive tumor about 150 years before invention of the first crude version of television during the 1920’s. The critical publication is a separatist document called the Declaration of Independence—a diatribe packed with unwarranted assumptions, a double standard, and sanctimonious claptrap. Just eleven years later some imperialists published a populist constitution which begins with a BIG lie.During the following decades, long before TV,  there was agitating literary trash like Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Lincoln’s war was followed quickly by amendments XIV and XV in 1868 and 1870, respectively. Their egalitarian content was propagated into lawyers’ thinking and courtrooms decades before radio and TV.Egalitarian momentum was well established before the 20th century. TV has been merely an accelerant.

            Sorry, not TV. The war was lost before Marconi developed the first radio. We already had the Civil Rights Act (1874) and two major Supreme Court decisions enshrining discrimination law and destroying free association. The only change was people realized blacks weren’t the only ones being discriminated against.I think its precious how people seem to think history started about the time they became self-aware. The Boomer experience with television wasn’t remotely close to yours. We didn’t camp out in front of the TV eating Twinkies and Ho-Hos. We were out riding bikes and playing right up until the streetlights started turning on. True also of early X, but about the time they started being called “latchstring kids”, television ruled their lives because “stranger danger.”

        If diversity was so great, and if diversity was so great for business, then why would the government have to use tyrannical powers to enforce it? The natural course of events would be to say that if a business doesn’t want to serve blacks (or anyone else), then they are denying themselves the wonders of diversity, they are punishing themselves by keeping Black Girl Magic out of their business, so they will get punished for it. Steve Sailer has been rightly criticized lately for living off inconsequential fluff, but he did post one interesting thing recently, which is that the eminent consulting firm McKinsey has been putting out reports extolling the power of diversity in improving your business for years. He pointed out that if diversity was so good for business, then there would be a bundle of money to be made by going long or short on companies depending on their diversity. Of course, nobody is doing that, and there is no bundle of money to be made. This is because McKinsey’s analyses are totally fake.I don’t know how much longer we can go living in this world that is totally fake. I wonder if the DOJ is gearing up for a lawsuit against trucking companies for discriminating against the “Substance Positive Community.”
