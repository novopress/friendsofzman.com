        I’m going to turn that entire post into a syllogism
Bad writers write about themselvesWomen always write about themselvesWomen are bad writers.
How’s that for brevity! Though I guess technically I am writing about myself

            Ha. I alluded to this in the post, but female writers probably need their own standard for bad writing. That said, whenever this comes up, I get female readers agreeing with me that they prefer male writers, so maybe there’s more to it. It seems that children’s literature is dominated by female writers, while poli-sci is dominated by males.
There’s probably some biology at work in the bad writing area, but I have not thought enough about it to say with confidence.

                The novel “Adam Bede” written in 1869 was written by a woman, “George Elliot”.  It was pretty good.  It became truly awful when she tried to do a sex scene halfway through the book.  From the male protagonist’s point of view.  It dragged on for several pages.  Only a woman could have been so clueless about the male perspective on this topic.

                    I read that book not too long ago and thought it quite good exactly up to the point you mentioned. I finished it, but it’s energy seemed to roll right off the table after that.

            There are some creditable female writers.  However, usually only women enjoy reading them and they occur less frequently, with only a handful rising to the status of “great.”  Good male writers have more universal appeal.  Men are also well represented in children’s literature.  Women make excellent poets, imo, but again few have achieved the same stature as male poets.

            Heartiste is something of a master stylist. Even on the rare occasions when I disagree with him, I still enjoy his flair and bravado. In an age of NPCs, the sheer force of his personality is refreshing.

        I note that he didn’t mention typos, LOL.But seriously, one thing I do like about Our Guys is the relentless push for new coinages. The War on Noticing. Magic Dirt. Browngeld. Pozz. Redpill. DR3. Et cetera. There are a lot of new realities bubbling up in our Brave New World, and our guys are trying to capture them.“My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel–it is, before all, to make you see.”–Joseph Conrad(From his novel with the gloriously politically incorrect title. Seriously, it’s actually a great book, and relevant to Our Thing: it’s about a sort of SJW of the time who’s out to wreck the camaraderie of a group of sailors.)

            I don’t understand why “cry bully” didn’t catch on more. It really catches the essence of the left. Perhaps writers are reluctant to use it, fearing a bunch of “internet tough guy” responses -ugh.
I think the word “cloaca” is even more appropriate, although the vulgarity distracts from the point somewhat.

            Whoa, hold on there! I have yet to be banned on Amazon, but it will come as soon as the creeps hear about my novels: I Like the White World, and Aryndell, a Sci-Fi novel with an amusing twist.
I LIke the White World is about Orange County CA and how glorious it can be, and also about truth. Dennis Prager is a character in it.

        “The most common trait of bad writers, it seems, is they write about themselves.”An interesting comment from Mr. Z.In perusing the biography section of Barnes &amp; Noble  you will see that it is chock full of autobiographies of folks that nobody knows or gives a rat’s ass about.TV/movie actors and “news” types  are well represented , which illustrates their conceit and ignorance; they are totally unaware that nobody cares to read about their lives and “struggles,” and are not important to anybody other than to themselves and perhaps to their tiny, cloistered club of equally unaware and arrogant associates in Manhattan, LA and DC.Of course, I have seen Michelle “It’s-Been-A-Struggle” Obama’s bio there as well; which I have not bothered to  flip thru,In thinking about all she has accomplished – oh, that’s right, not a F’n thing – I  guess I can see why she believes her life “struggles” (easily her favorite word when talking about herself) would be of interest to the world’s paramecium and other assorted single-cell life forms.Clearly, she and her hubby just can’t get over themselves and truly deserve each other.

        i’m in the midwest where Jews are few and far between, at least relatively speaking.  So in my experience, I have never met a Jew that didn’t tell me they were a Jew within the first few minutes of discussion.  I don’t care if you are a Jew, but apparently, if you are one, you care if I do.  My point is what you said about women writers applies to Jews also – like Jonah Goldberg.

        This is the reason that I had to quit reading James Lileks. He’s a fine wordsmith, and has some amusing insights on occasion (despite his TrueCon opinions), but his level of self-obsession is genuinely astonishing. Does he really think that anybody, anybody at all, really cares about how he arranges the glassware in his cupboards? He honestly wrote about this once. I mean, for Lord’s sake…

            I used to be astonished at the originality and how evocative so many of his similes, metaphors, and brief descriptions were. Almost Shakespearean in their freshness and aptness, and yet all wasted, it seemed to me, on complete ephemera and very light humor.As I writer, I agonize for an apt and bright metaphor. They don’t come easy for me, any more than writing jokes or ad libing witty banter. Mark Steyn succeeds where Lileks fails. Steyn’s wit (in the humorous and genius sense) is astounding. I only wished he didn’t stutter so much when talking. It makes it hard to watch him on video as much as I enjoy his company.Nor would Lileks ever countenance let alone endorse someone like Kathy Shaidle, another Canadian treasure.

        Self absorption and laziness are certainly the main path to bad writing.
But dirtbags who have to obfuscate also makes for bad writing.

        It’s also helpful to note that good writers are frequently motivated by a desire to inform or educate, often with the aim of conveying wisdom, which is beneficial to all. The worst writers are propagandists who merely wish to infect the weak-minded with agenda-driven messaging and ultimately achieve a hive mentality in the victims. The former should be encouraged, the latter should become extinct.

        Another bad trait is trying to be overly funny.  Or capping each thought with something cute.  Call it the Goldberg crutch.  There’s a few talented guys who can write in a constantly humorous style and pull it off.  But unless you’re of the caliber of a young P.J. O’rourke it shouldn’t be your go-to style.  Problem is these naturally funny guys make it look easy, so everyone thinks they can do it. Time magazine shouldn’t be trying.Women, old men and Jews should tread carefully with the funny. Women’s ‘wit’ either lags 7 years behind or is so current it’s painful.  Either way, it’s always borrowed.  Old men…whatever, something happens to the brain.  Jews have an odd silly streak.  A recent post by Kunstler on the Oscar’s is a good example of both old-man and Jew humor wrapped into one.  A representative line: “Glenn Close revealed that her gown contained four million beads and weighed forty pounds. I hope she donates it to the Clinton Foundation for HRC’s 2020 nomination acceptance speech.”  BTW about the old-man humor, I’m not talking about any of you here.  You guys are hilarious in ways you don’t even know.

                    O’Rourke sold out on immigration. The Irish are almost as bad as the Jews when it comes to Ellis Island romanticism, I mean, look at the Kennedys. As a recovering Irish American myself, I understand the impulse, but it’s utterly wrongheaded. The argument “Because the United States was good enough to let my ancestors in 150 years ago, we have to let Somalis destroy the country because feelz” is not exactly a coherent position.  Also, to be fair, O’Rourke had cancer a few years ago, and that would tend to knock the humor out of anyone.

            Goldberg was fine when he was content to be the clownish goofball, mocking liberal piety. Then he started thinking of himself as an intellectual. He’s become increasingly shrill and his limitations have become more plain.

                I flipped through Goldberg’s Suicide of the West at a BN a few months ago…he’s a poseur….my guess is he’s never read Hobbes, et. al, in fact, he’s not read much of anything substantial (anyone who relies as heavily as he does on pop culture probably hasn’t read much, not even in a desultory way…he’s a bubblegum pundit, so much intellectual lint.

                    From the interviews I’ve heard of Goldberg, he is well-versed in the intellectual history of conservatism.  The problem is not a lack of knowledge but of subversion.

He’s well-read. So what? He’s a pretentious twat and a hypocritical ideologue; any subversive element you see in Goldberg he just stumbled into along the way. No way it’s intentional. National Review is full of these types.

            Around 2001 when The Corner got going, I used to enjoy Jonah in small doses along with Lileks. Had an exchange with him when I was blogging and my beloved white GSD died. He had a white dog, too, back then. I thought some (a lot) of his Star Trek references and such were jejune but I had twenty years on him; chalked it up to Gen X attitude and manner.

            I must confess, I came to hate Buckley’s writing. When I was a young man, there was not a lot of choice, so plodding through Buckley’s act was tolerable. His habit of using obscure words really bugged me. Once in a while is fine, but like salt in the stew, too much is always bad. As he got older his columns became incomprehensible.

                    Tyrell is a classic example of how imitating the style of another writer, even a great one, can prevent a writer from finding his own voice. Tyrell idolized H.L. Mencken, and tried to write like him. This was a mistake, because of course he couldn’t do it, and also because, had Mencken lived in our era, he would have written in a different style. It’s very much like how all liberal presidential candidates tried for forty years to sound like JFK, and only succeeded in making fools of themselves. Tyrell always just sounded like a second-rate talent  trying to imitate Mencken – which is pretty much what he was.

            Having a hard science job,  I come at it from a perspective of precision of meaning.  Sometimes the high falutin word better conveys the idea and adds. Most usually simple and clear is better. I like Hemingway and  Steinbeck’s writing. That stated, one of my proudest achievements  is getting the phrase “hunkered down” published in hard science cell biology publication.  I do have occasion to write with graduates students.  Some of their writing is so atrocious that it shocks (for native english speakers, you expect from the chinese) .  With practice, and lashing, it does improve.   I learned to write from reading and i’m not exaggerating  when i state that i don’t know grammar ( ie a participle from my elbow).  I’m always surprised when i get the praise “well written” on my stuff.  It happens fairly frequently so i guess i’m not too bad.

        “Orwell’s second rule is “Never use a long word where a short one will do.” It’s the commonly abused by bad writers.”This is how you can easily deduce that the left, SJW/NPC left in particular, are intellectually bankrupt to go with their moral bankruptcy. You won’t FIND an article written by them that doesn’t use multi-syllabic nonsense words to seem more erudite when in reality they could have said the same sentence with probably 1/4 the amount of syllables.It is the hallmark of the intellectual charlatan in fact. For an absurdly egregious (there are my big words) of this the latest STEM class lunacy from Ontario is a textbook example.https://tomwoods.com/jordan-peterson-thinks-this-may-be-the-worst-sentence-ever-written/

        Let me say more about “big words”. WFB defended his use of obscure words by saying he didn’t use a “big word” – he used “The right word”. And I think that’s about right. There’s a big difference between using cant phrases like “racism” fascism” “the free market”, impenetrable jargon, or meaningless labels like “trumpism” or “authoritarianism” – and obscure words.  BTW, ever notice how the Left and Conservative Inc. are ALWAYS labeling their opponents some sort of “ist” or “ism”?  Its an old commie trick, designed to short-cut thought, a sort of sophisticated smear job. Again, this is completely different from using words like “Oxymoron” which WFB made popular. It does a job no other word can do – so concisely.

        Z: “A brilliantly worded comparison between two unrelated things is still a false comparison. It suggests dishonesty on the part of the writer.”  For the person with even a moderate knack for words the temptation to manipulate is everpresent.  It really takes a solid character not to dupe people when it’s so easy.  And if a writer is too obvious about it, there’s always an editor to fancy it up proper.

        Interesting inversion of the common trope about families. All good writers are different, but all bad writers are the same.
Jonah Goldberg and Ta-Nehisi Coates may write about wildly different things, but they do both have the same soporific style whose defining characteristic is navel-gazing.

            Is picayune really a highbrow word? I always thought it was a provincial throwback to something like Huck Finn. I’ve only seen it used to hint at a low class background but it’s so archaic that it actually comes off as refined.

        It’s rare that I will automatically buy a book based on the author. Exempting authors that have been dead for sixty years. One exception is Victor David Hanson. I have enjoyed all of his books, and I’ve yet to read one of his articles I could disagree with.

        WFB was an excellent writer, which is why he sold so many books. Too bad people didn’t like his use of “Big words” – but that’s a minor flaw. Its impossible to figure out what standard is being used by Conservatism Inc. to hire writers. Its not wit, an  interesting viewpoint, or prose style.  Pretty much every writer at the Bulwark, or NRO is nothing more than adequate.And nobody thought  – 20 years ago – that Lowrey or Jonah were “great thinkers” who were going to lead NR into a new Golden age. They were just placeholders, until we found the new Buckley.  But that never happened and everyone who WAS interesting was run off.  Looking back, we can see that Obama’s election allowed Conservative Inc. to fool us much longer than it should have. Had McCain been elected, their globalist libertarian beliefs would’ve been made obvious. As it was, they were able to spend 8 years pretending to one of us and ranting about Obama.

                Well said.  The use of big words is often showing off.  Buckley probably knew he was doing just that.  (“Let’s wow them with this baby!”)
