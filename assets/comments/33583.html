        The Sacklers are evil greedy demons… not to be compared to a great man like Hitler.

            I’d love to know if Z is correct about the (((Sacklers))) or if the reality is not that extreme. Nothing surprises me about these people with real money, though. They’ll walk all ever everybody to acquire it.

                I think like the Sassoons, they didn’t start the situation, but played a major role nonetheless.

        The oxycontin epidemic was a planned and organized genocide, deliberately targeted at White Heritage Americans, by jews, waged as a front in the Great Replacement, killing off the Whites as their replacements were imported. And they pretty much got away with it. By my estimation, there would be roughly 2 million more Whites living in AINO today were it not for this monstrous crime (counting not just the direct victims, but also the children they would have otherwise had, and the children their children would have had). This has electoral consequences (which were intentional), although it seems to have failed in the goal of turning Ohio blue. No doubt it helped with Pennsylvania and other places. Virginia, Michigan. Somehow Obama won Indiana in 2008 by about 30,000 votes.Everything about it, down to the small tactical details, was planned and orchestrated from on high. It was not some “natural” or “emergent” outgrowth of something you might expect from “managerialism” or “the blob.”

            What came first, OxyContin or the hollowing out of American industry and the great rust belt of middle America?  We need to consider “diseases of despair” as well in our condemnation.  If the solution were only so simple as to blame one law, or one greedy Pharma…

            I disagree. I don’t think it is a coincidence that the opiate epidemic started around the very same time China got into the WTO and thousands of US factories closed.Drug addiction is a disease of hopelessness and dysfunction. People generally don’t stick needles in their arms because everything is going great. Granted, you will always have a small number of people who will use drugs or abuse alcohol no matter the conditions they exist in. But they are the small minority.Dope has been around a long, long time. Specifically Heroin has been around since the 19th century when Bayer invented it and marketed it as a non-addicting analgesic and cough suppressant. The Sears Roebuck company famously offered pre-filled Morphine needles in their catalog. Though these things did increase drug use, the number of people using was never anywhere near what we have today, even per capita. If you include all drugs like alcohol and Marijuana, probably 20% of Americans are abusing drugs.

                You can watch the Netflix documentary about Oxycontin and the Sacklers. The facts of the case are not in dispute. My conclusions would no doubt be considered fringe. But what other conclusion can one draw from the fact that the Sacklers deliberately chose not just the regions but neighborhoods to be targeted, and the individual doctors? Why those regions and not others? No one asks these questions.

                    The facts about the Sackler family are true and I don’t dispute them.  What I dispute is the idea that you are going to have much success destroying an in-tact community with such drugs.  Yes, some people will and I don’t dispute that either.  But the vast majority of it comes down to not just availability (drugs have always been available), but also the hopelessness of broken communities.  The hollowing out of our manufacturing happened at the same time as Oxy started further wrecking communities and are no doubt co-conspirators.

                    And the result of the Sacklers and the resulting hysteria wrt someone, somewhere getting high, is that the last time I was in the hospital, there were forms to sign stipulating that I would receive such and such medically prescribe pain killers, for such and such time (10 days, tops), and if out out the hospital, I would have to come directly to the hospital pharmacy where I would take my “medicine” under supervision.  We were talking *major* surgery here!  The Fed’s—or any other government agency—has no business in such minutiae.This is complete bullshit.(BTW, stop basing your entire understanding on YouTube like documentaries—they also have an axe to grind.)

                        Yep.  Many legitimately in pain now can’t get relief, which pushes newbies into black markets that are quite profitable for gov, fed or state (cops, guards, prisons, programs etc.)
Like the devil himself, the State now is into torture. . . but for your own good, to be sure!  Trust them.  They will let you know just how much pain you can stand.

                            “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”

                                You have to be one of two things:  A heartless bastard, or a person who has never known someone—or they themselves—who has experienced true unceasing pain.
I been fortunate to have both had pain, and to know people in true pain.  I won’t be the one to tell them to suffer for the sake of themselves becoming “addicted”.
I understand there are those who game the system, but things have gotten out of hand from my personal experience.

                                        Torn meniscus a couple of times.  Pain so severe it does not allow walking, or initially even crawling. Incapacitation, albeit temporary in my case.More recently cardiac infarction.  Complete blockage and chest pain so severe as to cause loss of appendage control through violent contractions/convulsions, but my head was clear and I was able to get a priest to attend to my “true” needs in the OR.  The surgeon stood by looking piss’d. Screw him.This did not go away even after surgery, but control did returned to arms and legs.  After 12 hours, I conceded and allowed morphine injection.  It had almost no effect—either because dose was restricted or I have resistance. I did not followup as I am loathe to take pain medication anyway.It did not matter.  The pain was such that if it did not subside—heart was badly “insulted” or bruised—I would have gone home and killed myself, not even with a second thought. However within 24 hours, the pain became bearable and within a week was gone without pain medication.I would not wish on my enemy…as they say.

                                            Thanks for the reply. It makes you (or me at least) grateful for  what I take for granted each day. It’s easy to fall into that.
I used to work in an industrial setting and worried a couple times about if I’d got myself stuck in a “pinch point”. But I also imagined my arm wouldn’t hurt too much if the whole thing came off!

            More than that, it was specifically targeted towards veterans. Did a few too many jumps and your knees hurt? Here’s your lifetime dependence, I mean prescription, for percs. Most of the homeless vets you see started their journey as disaffected people coming back from warzones with serious injuries who were put on pain pills and the rest is history. Don’t take them into your home. Don’t give them money. If you want to help them, give them a sandwich (if they have the appetite to eat it, I’m told addiction to opiates makes you constantly nauseous), and curse the government that sent them into 2+ hosed warzones with no plans of exit and the only thing waiting for them on the other side was Dr. Feel Good. I was blessed by having a gene that makes opiates make me sick. A lot of my fallen comrades weren’t that lucky. Pray for them, hate the people who facilitated this for them, but don’t get personally involved. There are people who get paid to do that.

                Misuse of pain killers is one thing, having restricted use when applicable is another.  I have experienced pain so severe as to drop you on the spot.  You simply can’t move.  Fortunately this pain subsided within a short period and I could help myself get to some sort of respite.
Now imagine that pain never subsides?  I too have a resistance to pain and as near as I can tell, opiates—but I won’t sit in judgement of others.

            Even though I’m extremely cynical and always have been, once upon a time I would have seen all that is somewhat loony, Jeffrey. Yet this happened:
Biden Canceling Trump Plan On Opioid Treatment Prescriptions
Western politicians are largely powerless actors and impotent frauds and have to be viewed as third party beneficiaries, but they still have to get elected to grift. This no doubt was seen as a way to cull people.

        Being a Cincinnatian, I actually had the chance to meet probably the most pivotal character in the cocaine traffic. “Freeway” Ricky Ross was the main conduit between the CIA and the streets when Ollie North was trying to raise money for the Contras. Ross was very shrewd and made more than two billion dollars in today’s dollars while living in California. What was he doing in Cincy? He was obsessed with tennis from a very young age and had moved here for the ATP Masters tournament. He was a skinny guy and spoke in a gentle voice and you would have never guessed who he was or what he did. He looked a bit like Bobby McFadden, the guy who got famous singing “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.”No one believed him when he got busted and said he was trafficking for the CIA. North was considered a golden boy back then—this was before he got caught extorting Wayne LaPierre of the NRA. One journalist—at a second string paper—actually investigated all this. He wrote a book called “Dark Alliance,” before supposedly committing suicide by shooting himself multiple times in the head (he must have had a very hard head.) His name was Gary Webb and they made a fictionalized movie about his story, “Kill the Messenger,” that I’ve been meaning to see.I’m tempted to say Reagan’s legacy needs to be reevaluated (amnesty to three million illegals was the crack they needed to drive the wedge) but it would only lead to more gushing about how great he was from the usual suspects. I liked him when I was a child in the 80s, mostly because his name, through loose association, reminded me of Ronald McDonald.

I remember hearing about him, but I thought he was suicided because he uncovered evidence that White Flight to the suburbs had been a deliberate part of a long-term real-estate scam using blacks to drive whites out of the (potentially extremely valuable/desirable) inner-city neighborhoods they used to occupy, then use “gentrification” to drive the blacks out in turn once property values had cratered sufficiently…

                    Nah. There’s nothing special about a house. Unless it’s in a fancy neighborhood, It generally keeps getting sold and resold just like a used car. The owners get progressively poorer with each transaction. It’s just old and most people want something new if they can afford it. Not saying there wasn’t some of what you describe going on, just said most of it has to do with aging.

        The last point Z is talking about also speaks to the homeless issue. There is a massive industry built around “helping” homeless people, especially in cities like NYC and LA, except the homeless problem gets worse every year. And if you look at what the homeless “advocates” talk about, it’s basically about letting them do whatever they want and indulging their every vice. Hence we go from “hey let’s build a shelter so homeless people don’t have to sleep in the cold” to “that bum has the right to set up a tent in your front yard and pleasure himself when your daughter is waiting for the school bus”.Not coincidentally the homeless industrial complex is also intertwined with drug abuse, and the managerialism has taken over there too, where we now have “safe injection sites” where rather than “connecting addicts with services” like they claim, they are teaching them how to maximize their high and stuff like that, keeping them locked in. As mentioned, it is by design.

        Irecall reading a fiction book that had a guy deliberately poison a large drug supply, and the users – including celebs, politicians’ kids, etc. – began dropping like flies.  I’m fine with that.  History offers minimal encouragement on means to get weak and/or despairing people to desist from using substances deleterious to their health.  I don’t know that I regard illegal drugs as much different than all the ‘legal’ prescription ‘antidepressants’ people take.  Life can suck – and you just have to deal with it.  Those who can’t cope opt for drugs, alcohol, grift, violence, cheating, etc.  No, I don’t like people very much.

            This.  In sooo many aspects of life, we’ve abandoned “strict Darwinian selection”.  We simply can’t rectify these two aspects of recreational drug use.  In short, you want to abuse drugs, then accept the consequences and die in the street come winter—or sooner when you starve to death or overdose.We want it both ways.  We pick these people up, stabilize them in the nearest hospital, then release them to repeat the process of human degradation all over—until finally it is “all over”.  It’s a wealthy society’s “solution” to the problem of drug addition, but we are fooling ourselves and helping no one.

                Drug and alcohol rehabilitation is a multi billion dollar industry, a lot of which is paid for by Obamacare. I don’t know how many people it really helps, whether or not it’s worth it. There are success stories, I just don’t know what they are as a percentage, or whether or not it balances out economically. For the ones who do get better, it is common that after a couple decades of substance abuse, they are basically unemployable anywhere other than the substance abuse treatment industry. So you could say it’s sort of a jobs program for recovered addicts and alcoholics.

Albeit, the true/best answer is more varied and nuanced and dependent on the drug.  For example, alcohol needs to have its own consideration apart from opioids and stimulants. And of course, one relapse problem puts you in a much higher category of relapse probability.

                A couple years ago, the “health experts”, giddy on all the cred they thought they earned during the pandemic, started talking up how EVERYONE needed to start carrying around narcan as we went about our day. This is so we can save people we see overdosing on the street or whatever.Obviously this didn’t catch on but they still say this. It speaks to the insanity of the situation we live in, where normal people are supposed to care more about the lives of junkies than the junkies do, and where we are supposed to put the safety and wellbeing of junkies ahead of our own (as we saw in the Penny incident, these people get so far gone that even EMTs are afraid of touching them, but we’re supposed to run up and save their lives if they are ODing).

                    I agree, but I also maintain that long time drug users are “broken”.  They no longer are competent to live in society on their own.  The point being that you “can’t fix crazy” as they say.  (And by the way, in my burg, all city police carry Narcan…). 🙁

                    One of the most jarringly incongruous bits of propaganda the government puts out is their treatment of dangerous drugs like heroin and fentanyl vs. cigarette smoking.Here in the rust belt, it’s common to see billboards or commercials from state or county boards of health reminding you that doing hard drugs doesn’t need to be an impediment to a normal life, just make sure you’ve got narcan and you shoot up with a friend. But watch a TV commercial pertaining to smoking and it’s a guaranteed death sentence that results in only misery, pain, disfigurement, and the grave.  What on earth is the agenda behind that?

I live close enough to Port-o-Potty that recently I actually saw some silly college-age girl (of course) wearing a little button pin on her backpack advertising that she carried Narcan. I have to admit it crossed my mind that some clever local entrepreneur probably made some good money selling those pins and other similar ones to silly little bitches like her. Bet she also bought a Ukie flag pin too.

                We bring back “institutions”.  In the bad old days of my youth, we called them “insane asylums”, but we had an (IMHO) a valid concept—some people can not live independently among society, they are not equipped for it.  Similarly, if we can’t stand stepping over the drugged out bums on the street, then we maintain them in some sort of confined area where they can be watched.  But as said, this is expensive, but the kindest way to handle those who are “broken”.  But hell this is America—the home of the free—let the bums rule the streets until they go away by themselves.

                    Bringing back asylums is a great idea. Get people the help they need. I’m all for that, but they have to want help, or it’s a waste. No good but the good person’s pride.
Hence the ditch, as ugly as it is. Some people will see what they want, and decide they don’t want it. I met a couple of them. Others will be out of their misery and won’t be inflicting it on everyone else. Which tends to happen anyway.

                    Realistically, there’s only two ways to deal with the insane. I’ve lived long enough to see them both tried, and they both suck.While putting the legitimately insane in institutions would probably be the most reasonable and humane thing to do, let’s remember why we aren’t doing it anymore.Recollect that the hospitals and insurance companies made a cottage industry out of locking people up. Apparently, kids smoking weed were sufficiently “insane” to warrant being locked up in institutions (without criminal charges or due process). That is why it is almost impossible to involuntarily commit anyone these days, the practice was so wildly abused.Certainly, turning babbling schizophrenics out on the street to shift for themselves isn’t working out much better, but there were reasons we got rid of the institutions.This is one of those problems there just aren’t any good solutions to. Neither locking them out or turning them loose is satisfactory.

                        The main (not only) reason we were able—and induced—to close “insane asylums” was drug treatment with a new category of psychoactive drugs.See:Madness and the Brain by Dr. Solomon H. Snyder, first published in 1974, that delves into the neurobiological underpinnings of severe mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia.This was required reading in my undergraduate years.  Basically, we were sold on the concept of “treating” mental illness with these drugs and mainstreaming back into society these heretofore committed mentally ill people.  The US population was turning Leftist in those days and the politicians, as always, were whores for the money to be saved.Of course, there was one unmentioned flaw in this effort.  There was no way to assure that the mentally ill maintained their drug treatment regimen once returned to the street.  🙁But by then the damage was done.

            The CIA proposed to purchase the entire world supply of LSD in the early 1950s, supposedly to keep it out of the hands of the Soviets. Production was shifted to the US.
The Soviets had no problems with LSD afaik, but within about ten years the USA was awash in the stuff. The “Elite” held that only they should partake, others wanted to dose everyone. “Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out”. The “counter culture” sure had a massive corporate presence. It’s almost comical in retrospect.

            But Jeffrey Tucker is a retard and a fag.  He was virulently anti-Trump for all the typical leftist reasons.  He is a typical left wing libertarian despite his connections with the Rothbardian side of libertarianism.
Also, one should be willing to reexamine their beliefs when they are proven wrong.  The loosening of drug war law enforcement in places around the country and in some other countries have made the drug problem worse, not better.  In 2010, we had only 1 example in Amsterdam. Now we have quite a few and all of them have been total failures by any metric.

                    When drug consumption was illegal, at least I could walk down a street in Manhattan without it smelling like a Cheech and Chong movie set. When it was illegal, you didn’t have unlicensed pop-up stores selling blunts and edibles to 13 year olds who then go on to fry their brains.
This isn’t even getting into Portland’s disastrous experiment with legalization.

                        Portland – the one word rebuke to everyone advocating “legalize everything!” because they did, during the Coof when everyone was distracted by all the nonsense about the vaxx and the masks. It’s still uninhabitable today and the rents have gone way up in my suburb because anyone who isn’t a junkie or criminal has moved out and come here. Granted Portland was always a steaming pile of hipster shit but I knew it would get worse when they legalized everything. And even here everything smells like a Cheech and Chong movie set but at least we don’t have to worry about stepping on used needles like they do 15 miles East. F*ck Portland, f*ck legalization and f*ck the whole West Coast with a handful of dirty needles.America needs a new motto, goodbye “land o’ the free”, hello “it can always get worse!”.

                The problem is always whether we can reasonably proscribe various “drugs” vs whether these drugs are dangerous to societal well being. Just about every known drug is problematic in one use or another, unfortunately most elective use cannot be prevented. Latest example is Marijuana. Oldest, alcohol.
The problem of course is the “because we can do little, we should do nothing” nihilism that arises.  I fear we are forever to be in that quandary.

                    We can start by making the importation or manufacturing of hard drugs a capital offense.  They are killing 100,000 people a year, not to mention torturing millions of addicts and wrecking their lives and family’s lives.A lot of people who import drugs get little to no punishment when they are caught.  Most of them are mules and don’t know much of anything.  AFAIK, they are not using the vast surveillance apparatus for enforcing drug trafficking laws.  A lot of the kvetching about the drug war is just lies and or exaggeration.There is a lot to criticize about the drug war.  The drug war is used as an excuse to mess with people (I smell marijuana, I have to search your car) and to rob people on the side of the road.  Or the border being redefined as the border plus 100 miles (which houses like 80% of the US)“The problem of course is the “because we can do little, we should do nothing” nihilism that arises.”Sadly, I think you’re right.  We get clownworld or nothing.  But it doesn’t have to be this way.

China had an opium problem. Capital punishment fixed it.
Singapore never has…because it’s a rapidly enacted death sentence for mere possession.
In the US, we allow 100,000 death and ten times as many destroyed lives per year while allowing the Sacklers to grow rich beyond  belief and the cloud people chuckle when the son on the VP leaves his cocaine stash in the guest room of the White House.

                        Not going to work I fear.  Here is but one reason—which I’ve actually observed myself.  Drugs sold on the street right next to my university involved 10-12 yo “runners”. When my car was stopped at a long light, they solicited me.  If I gave them money, they ran around the building complex next to the street and got my product. And no, this was not a scam.  I witnessed successful transaction after transaction occur.You gonna execute a 10 yo?  Not gonna work.  I suppose you could execute the addict, but as I said the addict’s mind is broken.  You might as well make the same argument for traffic violations in order to make the roads safer to drive upon.Increasing penalties is usually not the answer—especially for non-enforcement in the first place.  And adequate enforcement and punishment is *expensive*, which is why we don’t have such.

Lot’s of thought talk here, no experience.  Before you make the fallacious argument of more and more extreme punishment, perhaps you investigate just how many of these folk have 1) been caught, and 2) got off with light or no sentence, then 3) recidivised.
When those criteria are met, we can justify harsher punishment.

                            I anticipated this response by saying “the importation or manufacturing of hard drugs”Do I think we should make mere possession a capital offense? No. My best friend of decades is in the ground and he died with a needle in his arm (on Kensington ave noless) under the age of 45. 40 something year olds should not be in the ground.If there wasn’t all these hard drugs smuggled into the US (or precursors), these 10-16 year olds would have nothing to push. Also, I support capital punishment for dealers using 10 year olds in their dealing.You cannot clandestinely create fentanyl or meth from scratch. It requires too much up front capital (which will be lost at first discovery) and PHD chemists who have plenty of high paying options open to them and precursor chemicals which are tightly controlled. There is a reason nobody has Quaaludes anymore.

                            I think you underestimate building will. I have ZERO problem executing the lot. This is utterly existential. There are no boundaries and there is only one rule.The numbers like me are growing and will continue to grow by leaps and bounds when Pres. Trump’s civic nationalism fails. All I want is a thin veneer of authority backed by adequate local support, the better fifth of the local population should do.However, by the time we get to that point, and we WILL get to that point, serious (war, rather than law) deportations will be on the table. No one will need to execute 10 yo’s when you are expelling them and their entire families to their new country carved out the corpse of the Global American Empire.I expect this sounds crazy to many. Remember Yugoslavia? Their left corporate ruling class thought the same thing. They were wrong. The left corporate vermin who rule over us are also wrong. EVERY grifting imperial ruling class in human history never believed in their heart of hearts that their grift was going to end, too, but every single one of them did.

                    New designer drugs are constantly being synthesized. It’s an almost insoluble problem, not that we shouldn’t try to suppress them by going after the criminal cartels that produce them. But I’m afraid the bigger problem is that the government really does want a sedated, helpless, demoralized populace. We’ll see what the Trump admin can do about it. The global elites behind it are after a global population collapse worldwide to “save the planet”. The drug onslaught is just one prong in their attack to reduce the most independent populations. The ongoing drug attack on Appalachian culture is just the most obvious example of this. If they can import the Haitian cat-eaters and their ilk into every small town in the US and so on it becomes very demoralizing. There are so many other anti-human things they do that it becomes overwhelming to trad culture such as a negress winning best country album of the year award. It begins to seem “normal” to youth who don’t even know what normal is.

        One of the most insidious policies of the drug war is forcing drug arrest quotas on law enforcement agencies which is how you end up with police acting as drug traffickers &amp; also going around planting drugs.It also shows that the government never really had any plans on actually eradicating drugs from society, it was just another money making scheme with the populace getting shafted from every angle.It was a happy coincidence that they also turned every single aspect of the country into a hellscape of hopeless despair which primed the population for escapism. That was the lynchpin that made it all possible in my opinion.In my lifetime I’ve watched people who occasionally engaged in vice as a social lubricant steadily become totally lost &amp; dependent on it to make it through the daily grind. When there’s no light at the end of the tunnel &amp; nothing to live for tomorrow its not only easy but almost logical to get wrapped up in a addiction cycle.A lot of people think there’d be a revolution if drugs were removed from society but I’m absolutely positive the only thing that would change is the suicide rate would spike even higher as a result.Its to the point where you can’t listen to the radio, go to a store, show up to a job or engage in any aspect of daily life without beingconstantlyassaulted by clown world. Its extremely oppressive &amp; the end result reminds me of animals in captivity that die prematurely &amp; won’t breed.The average person isn’t self aware of the psychological forces at play so when something that numbs the sensation is dangled in front of them there’s no hesitation &amp; no obvious reason to not indulge. Given that it’s not surprising so many people are doing illicit drugs, antidepressants or engaging in hedonism.I read a while back that the mexican birthrate has flatlined &amp; that the black suicide rate among the young is rising. Those two races are not environmentally sensitive, not anywhere near as much as Whites are anyway. They’re used to living in squalor but they’re now being affected which is a testament to how unnatural our society has become. Seems like if you can’t insulate your culture &amp; your kids from society they’ll get ground down just like Whites were &amp; that’s getting harder &amp; harder to do.A century or so ago you could get many of the same drugs floating around today right off the shelves of stores yet there was no drug epidemic. Same thing applies to guns &amp; mass shootings. There’s definitely a dysgenic element to this but that’s also downstream from a culture that deliberately breeds such people.

        One thing I’ve learned in the past few years: American blacks are wiser than the racist right gives them credit for. They’ve been yapping about government drugs in the ghetto for decades; they don’t pay taxes or deal with banks, they act like they’re never home and unreachable, they instinctively distrust media, they didn’t fall for the Covid vax, and they pretend to like Dems because of the gibsmedats. They are irreverent and recognize Game, take advantage if they can, and most importantly: they scare people.
White people need to learn a thing or two about our AA countrymen.

                Did you mean partially or particularly? I have asked myself that question on occasion, doubting my sanity under the constant negrophilia of our dominant culture. Apparently at the base level though, they were hybridized from a Homo Erectus-like progenitor. At least we get a “blast from the past” when we encounter one resorting to his/her natural inclinations, i.e., the classic “chimp-out.”I also respect Marko’s opinion however, as I think he is entirely correct about them. I’ve spent a lot of time around them. They will try to undermine your priors if you let them wheedle their way in, that is, “get next to you” as they put it. They are basically hostile to whites because as Mr. Bridge said, “They resent us.” That’s reason enough for me to avoid them.

            Good post, but I don’t agree that they didn’t fall for the covid vax.  Everywhere I went I saw blacks wearing masks.  It also could be that they were hiding from the law… one never knows with the criminal race.

                True, they masked up more thoroughly than whites did. In fact, I still see them walking down the street with masks strapped to their chins. But blacks believe in ghosts more than science.

                        Definitely the worst Covid hysterics. There was this Chink restaurant I used to patronize. A very good takeout joint. Well, when the Covidiocy struck, the owners and staff naturally donned the moron masks–nothing unusual in that. However, in addition to wearing masks, they forbade customers entering their restaurant to pick up their orders. Instead, they nuggra-rigged this little kiosk in the front of the building where you slipped them the money/debit card, they processed it, and then handed you your order through this little window. And if that wasn’t ridiculous enough, they continued this asininetheatre derangeeuntil they went out of business merely months ago. In other words, they preferred to go out of business rather than take hold of reality and admit to themselves that they were in no danger and never had been. **smh**

I imagine he had some explaining to do to the local Coof-commisars about that if anyone remembered what he wrote.

                They have a lot of weird beliefs. For instance the idea of being “cock-strong”. They believe that if a man doesn’t get enough pussy, then his hand strength increases to a vise-like amplitude. They attribute being “cock-strong” mostly to white men whom they think don’t get enough pussy. I shook hands with a black guy once and I kept increasing the pressure. Finally, I was near my limit and I saw a trace of fear cross his face. I gave it my last effort when he suddenly gave out this yowl and jerked his hand away. I could tell he was convinced I was “cock-strong.” He was right, I hadn’t had any pussy in several months lol.

            Is there any valid true actual evidence that peeps likeMengela ever harmed anyone at all?
At this point, my working assumption is that 110% of the evidence at Nuremberg was fabricated directly into existence by Hollywood screenwriters.
I wouldn’t trust the Nuremberg verdicts if the only conclusion they came to was that the Sky was Blue and the Grass was Green.
In my book, anything tainted with the sign of the Harvest God is nothing but lies upon lies upon lies.

        It is absolutely not true that you can sue the cops if they violate your rights.  “Qualified Immunity” should really be called Unlimited Immunity.The SCOTUS invented QI, but they made a rule that you can only sue the cops if they violate your civil rights and are on notice of it through court cases.  But you need a precedent in order for the QI to be overcome.  So there are very few precedents and no new ones can be created.  It’s a catch 22. You need a case to set the precedent, but cases can only get through if a precedent has already been set.There are some outrageous cases where QI was upheld despite EXTREME abuses of rights.  The cops can literally beat you to the beat of the Macarena and there ain’t a goddamned thing you can do about it.  The only people you can sue is the city.  You cannot sue to the individual cops because they are not on notice that they cannot beat you to the beat of the Macarena.

        Good discussion, but I don’t see American softies ever waging the kind of drug war that would work.  So, what is best for long term mitigation of this unfixable problem?I’m not sure we have the right data to figure it all out.  But we do know that political views are largely a product of biology, and so is one’s predilection for addiction.  Do those correlate?   If yes, in the long term what happens if we allow the Portland experiment to continue, on a mass scale?   The place no doubt attracted a disproportionate number of addicts by legalizing so I can’t say how many normal natives suddenly became drug fiends.   But I suspect not really very many.  It pulled in outside addicts.It would be an ugly process but letting that part of the population destroy itself may be eugenic.   Better to ban Narcan instead?I believe the best measure is well crafted anti-drug propaganda.  Show what that poison really does, and rub people’s noses in it.   A frying egg in a pan (your brain on drugs!) Is not scary.   A mouth of horribly rotted teeth from meth would work a lot better.  If they spent as much time demonizing drugs as they do  demonizing Whites maybe we’d get somewhere.

            Portland’s social problems started years ago when the idiotic liberal electorate kept voting for massive handouts to the homeless. Most of the local churches, for instance, are addicted (ironic isn’t it?) to grants from the State or city to provide freebies for the hobos. That and the mild winters attracted people from all over the nation who were allergic to work and sobriety. Then they got the bright idea to legalize all drugs.It may have been unintentionally like a well done marketing strategy. First, develop a market (bring in hobos from everywhere west of the Mississippi), offer something they like (free food and shelter), then the bait ‘n switch to hard drugs. As the Underpants Gnomes would say – profit!

        There are people who can use alcohol and drugs without problems. What percentage are these versus those who cannot?
Presumably, this is why Prohibition was repealed. Most people judged that they could enjoy alcohol without bad consequences.
Cities like Portland demonstrate that when drugs are legalized an intolerable proportion of people cannot use them responsibly.
Are the only choices banning or legalizing all drugs? If we ban them, there is some proportion who can use them without problems, yet the damage done by those who cannot is terrible.

            It depends somewhat on the drug and how it is used. If you take 100 people and shoot them up with heroin every day, after two weeks you’ll have 100 heroin addicts. Take 100 people and get them drunk every day, after two weeks, maybe you’ll have 5 alcoholics.

                You know, Opioids – including heroin – are an “easy kick”, physiologically speaking: withdrawal, is 48-72 hours of “flu-like.” (Alcohol withdrawal, on the other hand, can be lethal if not adequately managed.)But the will to stayoffof the dope- ah, a different story! Once one has “Been To The Ball with THAT demon”, the desire to keep on dancing is…?

                The stat’s are (IIR), of those who touch alcohol, 14% or so will have some type of abuse problem during their lives.  As far as opiates, I do not know.  But one thing I’ve experienced over a lifetime is that people taken pain killers—who have *real* pain—do not normally become addicted.  Don’t buy into the Fed FUD.  The panic over people getting addicted has caused much grief and suffering.

            The people who can use them without problems are not better people because they can. It still drags them down and constantly exposes them to the problems of addiction. There’s no upside to legal drugs. It’s only a marker of a society that has abandoned all hope.

                    No, because alcohol has other uses, it’s ridiculously easy to make at home out of anything, and it’s obviously been interwoven into universal human society for thousands of years. I would call alcohol the exception that proves the rule.My argument is not negated by a historical exception. There is no upside to letting any other drug eventually take the status of alcohol.

                        There is a point however to be made with alcohol, that of genetic adaptation through millennia of use.  Every advanced society that has progressed to farming and grain harvesting discovered fermentation.  From there, alcohol consumption.  Conversely, many primitive societies—basically hunter-gatherers—never got that far.  Hence great problems with alcohol addiction and such.  Example, American Indians.

                That’s the vibe I’m getting. I still have enough libertarian in me that if I thought drugs were being legalized out of respect for our individual choices, I’d be able to go along with it.
But when I see drugs getting legalized along with shoplifting and other abhorrent  behavior, one is strongly left with impression that they aren’t doing it out of respect for our freedom, but simply because the authorities can’t be arsed with keeping order any longer.

            This is why I think social credit systems are underrated. We don’t ban things like guns and drugs because we’re afraid Jeff Bezos will get coked out and shoot up his backyard. What we’re afraid of is Jonquerious getting coked out and shooting up our neighborhood.So I have no problem with a system that allows responsible people like Bezos to use his own judgment with regard to firearms and drugs, while denying them to Jonquerious.When your operating principal is Equality Under the Law, your laws are going to end up getting made to accommodate the lowest common denominator. Which is pretty much what has happened.

        Protection rackets work best when people are afraid. The biggest gains for the administrative state have been when people were fearful: the Great Depression, WWII, the Cold War, 9-11, and Covid all generated fear and a great leap in the reach of the administrative state. If Trump can return us to a relatively peaceful state by ending the new Cold War, the administrative state will take a big hit.

        Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers were rightly condemned for their criminal behavior but they are far from alone. All the principal drug manufacturers have been found guilty of criminal behavior that killed thousands. They pay the fines and go on with business as usual. It’s a cost of doing business and nobody goes to jail. The Sacklers and Purdue paid a large fine but the Sacklers were alleged to have salted away $1 billion in Swiss banks ahead of the fines. A particularly egregious case was the Vioxx scandal. Marketed by Merck as a miracle anti-inflammatory drug, it was on the market for five years. Merck hid data that showed that the drug significantly increased the risk of heart attack and stroke. Eventually the feds investigated and concluded that the drug may have killed as many as 50,000 people. Merck eventually copped a plea, paid a settlement that was a small fraction of the profit they made on the drug and went on with business. Nobody went to jail. Ron Unz pointed out that during the five years Vioxx was on the market, there was demographic statistical anomaly in that there was an increase in deaths of 100,000 per year, mostly among the older population (the population targeted for Vioxx use). The anomaly disappeared when Vioxx was removed from the market. That is 500,000 dead people. Coincidence?

        42:50This section of this week’s Z-Man podcast reminds me of the opening scene of the filmLayer Cake.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8MGBn3KawMXXXX: When I was born, the world was a far simpler place. It was all just cops and robbers. But it wasn’t for me.Then came the Summer of Love. Hashish and LSD arrived on the scene. There were villains locked away for twelve years for robbing a bank of ten grand, doing time with drippy hippies down six months for smuggling two million quid’s worth of puff. I mean work it out, mate. We’re in the wrong fucking game. Drugs. Changed. Everything.Always remember that one day all this drug monkey business will be legal. They won’t leave it to people like me. Not when they finally figure out how much money there is to be made. Not millions. Fucking BILLIONS. Recreational Drugs PLC: “Giving People What They Want.” Good times today, stupor tomorrow.﻿But this is now. So while prohibition lasts, make hay while the sun shines. I’m not a gangster. I’m a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine. I mean ten years ago, a bit of charlie was for pop stars or a celebrity’s birthday bash. It was demonized byDaily Mailreaders getting drunk in naff wine bars. Now they’re my biggest clients.This is Clarkie. Double first at Cambridge in industrial chemistry. Only he’s got to pay off his student loans somehow. Today I only deal in kilos. And, depending on which tariff you use, will cost you 28 grand, or fifteen years in prison. Which is more time than a rapist’s [sentence].C’est la vie.It is vital that we work to a few golden rules: Always works in small teams. Keep a very low profile. Never deal with anyone who doesn’t come recommended. I mean it’s like selling anything: washing machines, hand-made rugs, blow jobs. As long as you don’t take the piss, people will always come back for more. And that’s not to say that we don’t weave that special kind of magic that turns two kilos into three, but never be too greedy.Know and respect your enemy! It is only very, very stupid people who think the law is stupid. And avoid like the plague, loud attention-seeking wannabe gangsters in it for the glory, to be a face, to be a name. They don’t mean to fuck up. They just do.Oh, and forgive me for stating the obvious, but stay away from the end user. They’re guaranteed to bring you trouble. As do guns. I hate guns. And violence. But, as some Roman general once said: “If you seek peace, prepare for war.” Morty, and his assistant Terry watch my back. Morty learned to be cautious the hard way. He did ten years inside. He’s my bridge to the criminal world. And he insures that the traffic is one way….

        It was real in his mind:“WHEN RICK DOBLINwas in his early twenties, he had a dream in which he was escorted back in time to witness a Holocaust survivor’s narrow escape from the Nazis.In his mind, Doblin travelled to Eastern Europe to witness thousands of Jews lined up alongside a mass grave as the gunners open fire, toppling the bodies into the earth. The man spends three days alive underground before emerging and fleeing to the woods, where he survives the war in hiding.The man then tells Doblin that he survived this horror only to deliver a message that Doblin should devote his life to promoting psychedelics as a cure for human ills and an insurance policy against another Holocaust. Then he expires.Doblin took the advice to heart. For much of the next four decades, he waged an often frustrating battle to get public health authorities to recognize the value of psychedelics, the perception-shifting compounds popularised in the 1960s that have been a source of both fear and fascination ever since…”Jewish health advocate trying to turn psychedelic drugs into legal medicine – The Jewish Independent

        I am all for police actions against drugs. People do respond to incentives, including expense and fear of jail time. Recreation drugs are all bad at all times for everyone.* Allowing them is a nod to modern despair and tendencies towards hedonism. However, the “war on drugs” modernly is grift. How it’s attacked properly is to throttle the supply, which involves securing the borders and throwing the book at drug dealers.I would argue that open borders and concerns about jailing blacks over “just” drug use has created a non-war on drugs. Thus the unsurprising explosion of use, particularly in poor whites.*But what about alcohol and cigarettes?? Neither are ideal. However, cigarettes get people through work and alcohol is special in human history. Further it’s possible to use alcohol in ways that are helpful, ie sterilization/improvement of water etc.

            Ah, yes – The old alcohol is more dangerous than drugs bit.  People who drink a triple after work are far more productive in the long run than people who light a joint.
And for every old person who dies at 62 of cirrhosis of the liver, there are a couple young people dead before their thirties from ODs or despair from the ruined life of a junkie.

            The quandary is that there are people with low intellect out there and eventually broken minds.  They can no longer make rational choices—as you and I would define.  As such, incentives no longer work to entice these people into a productive way of life.

                We don’t abandon laws about murder because people still commit the act. I don’t know why it’s allowable when it’s about drugs. Check that, I do know why. People want to indulge, rather than concern themselves with the potential addicts.

There is an implicit assumption there of a “sound mind”.  I maintain these folk do not have such minds.  However, that logic is not to be extrapolated to doing nothing, only to changing methods of deterrence for such people.

        On the decline of cocaine:
It’s still out there, but you’re not wrong that it’s declined a lot in the young party crowd. I have some people on the periphery of my social circle still in the hard partying young crowd, and the drugs of choice are Ritalin and zyn (nicotine) patches. These are guys that have done both coke and Ritalin, and according to them, the Ritalin gives them 90% of what coke gives them, and you can get it with a prescription.

            Elon doesn’t know what he looks like. He’s an actual nerd in that sense. And he’s high as Paul Bunyan’s balls almost all the time. Any blasphemous display, intentional or otherwise, ischildishness.Our elite appears—desires to appear—demonic, Satanic, transgressive, etc., because it’s puerile, like a teenage goregrind band (without the obscene poetry). There is a core of child rapists and child rapist groupies in there, but they don’t advertise and nerds aren’t invited.(Epstein™ is a different thing. Actual sickos aren’t into teenage prostitutes. That’s a fetish of men who had a bad time—or a really good time—in high school, not of mental wrecks consumed by perversity. “What luck!” not “I can only get it up forhalfa baby.”)
