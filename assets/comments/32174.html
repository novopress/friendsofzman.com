        Sorry Z Man, but the epic evil behind Covid completely dominates that being perpetrated in the Ukraine.Here in The Isles, nobody much seems to care about the “GAE-initiated-proxy-war-with-Russia”. It is rarely mentioned by those whose company I frequent. The only time people seemed to care was when petrol prices went from around £1.40 per litre to £1.99. Thatwasbad.As you, and all readers here well know, Covid wasorders of magnitudewas than the Ukraine thing. The lies and distortion were epic and had direct effects and everybody, everywhere, for the best part of two years.If the people memory-holed the Covid lies, they’ll not even notice the Ukraine lies. It simply isn’t as directly andobservablyimportant or as ubiquitous as The Shamdemic.Conclusion: It’ll take more than Ukraine to get people to feel even mildly annoyed with “Their” Government.

            No doubt Covid dwarfs the Ukraine folly (at least prior to Canned Sunshine bringing about a New Morning in America), but as I read it Z was talking about the cumulative effect of the two.

                Jack,I’m not really even sure that for anyone except Dissidents, there’ll be much of a cumulative effect. Most have accepted the memory-holing, and so the Uke lies will simply be taken as one isolated incident. That is to say that most people only care about the Government’s present lies, if they care at all.I also read it the way the way you mentioned, but I just feel that the two events are so beyond compare with regards to magnitude, that Covid itselfoughtto have been enough. But it wasn’t.That said, not sure if I’ve articulated myself here well or not.

                    You have a point.  Low information voters will buy into the inevitable excuse that the Ukraine conflict could have been won if we had only given more aid faster to Ukraine.

                        Losers usually salve themselves with rationalizations and excuses. And the losing publics of the West will do just that with the official rationalizations and excuses put on offer by the ruling class. Easier to do that than face unpleasant truths.

No doubt, but that is piling up dry cordwood ready for the spark from an economic implosion. I’ve never thought the catastrophes alone were sufficient to cause much reaction sans deprivation. The it is game on.
As always, you’ve articulated yourself quite well. I just see the memoryholing as making what the future holds all the worse. I look at Covid the same way as child abuse is described: shoved into the recesses of memory until the time something causes it to come to the fore again.

                        Jack,
You analogy to child abuse, whilst unpleasant, is apt. It’s a good way to describe the phenomenon. And I agree.

                    “Most have accepted the memory-holing”It was more than that.During covid I was following a number of anti-vax blogs.  As soon as the vax mandates went away, there was an effort to brow-beat everyone into “forgiveness” by a number of the regular posters.This is something very wrong with the psychology of the right in general.  In addition to gullibility and pathological altruism, there is this phenomenon of what I call “promiscuous forgiveness” whereby people who have not repented, and are still free to repeat their evils are given a free pass by virtue signalers who love to point out how forgiving they are.Trumps first term was another example of this.  His campaign promised to lock Hillary up and go after all the other Obama era crimes.  But then he just let everyone get away with everything, and there was a sizable part of right-wing commentary that was telling everyone else that we should all just forgive and move forward.

                        whereby people who have not repented, and are still free to repeat their evils are given a free pass by virtue signalers who love to point out how forgiving they are.Exactly. And many of these promiscuous forgivers are, apparently, Christians.As Christ told us, if you rebuke your brother, and he repents, then forgiveness is the way. But as you mention, there isnorepentance on the part of Leftists.Furthermore, Rightists mostly don’t recognise Evil – so they keep appeasing it. It is a truly Satanic situation. Naturally, when these people forgive, to show others how forgiving they are, the commit the incredible sin of pride.

                        And that’s why we lost our homeland.  The unfortunate truth is that a certain amount of sociopathy is required to effectively rule, even for benevolent rulers.  If by some miracle a few generations from now the “right” takes power again, the proper move is to round up all of the leftists, the white leftist women, all the problematic browns, and all of the tranny mutants and their pedophilia peddlers and tie them together.  Then promptly ship them to the deepest part of the ocean, attach heavy weights and throw them over the side.  Any pleas for mercy or cries for help should be stoically ignored.  After that, issue decrees that anyone who engages in this behavior again will face the wood chipper at full throttle feet first.  It sounds extreme, but it is necessary.  You’d be amazed at how fast it unravels the conditioning that has been allowed to take place.of course we all know this is a pipe dream, but it illustrates the gap between what must be done versus what will be done.

            The main lesson that I take from C0v1d and Ukraine is that there are many smart people who cannot think for themselves.  They just believe what they are told.
Whatever fine thoughts I might have had about representative government, where all people debate the important issues, I must conclude that most people, even many smart ones, just accept what they are told.  Representative government, at least the part that involves debates that determine policy, seems to ask too much of many people.

                I think you’re correct. This has been my experience of friends and family. The impact of covid was minimal for people who worked for companies who provided a furlough scheme – in fact it was a nice holiday. The nonsense with masks and social distancing was an annoyance – but I gave up trying to resist and just complied with when and where necessary. my observations of the vax was that lots of people just took it for granted that the government and health authorities had the public’s best interest at heart and so were happy to get jabbed thinking this was a just as innocent as taking ibuprofin or asprin for a headache. just another neat and tidy modern solution to pain, suffering and or the threat of death. The general public have become too cosseted by modern medicine and public health care provision. Lots of people thought I was stupid for not taking the shots. In my youngest child’s class a couple of his class mates have parents who are doctors. They had their children jabbed !

        Between this and the loss of the petro-dollar, the Satanic cabal that runs this empire is quickly losing credibility. Even normies are starting to see through the bluster.This is how revolutions start. The end of the Czarist regime started with the slaughter at the Battle of Tsushima, when the Russians lost 11 battleships when Admiral Togo and the Japanese Navy “crossed their T” in the narrow straits.Maybe a defeat in Ukraine does the same for Western regimes such as ours that seek the destruction of the people they rule with mass immigration, cultural debauchery such as sodomy, legal drugs and lax policies on crimes against citizens and vicious enforcement of crimes against the state.

                Another brick in the wall.  Apparently a petro-dollar settlement agreement with the Saudis, dating back to 1974, just expired (have to confirm) and the first $50b of frozen Russian asset transfer to the “war effort” has been approved.  This will not end well.

                I’m of the camp that the Saudis know they have the US by the short and curlies and are going to extract some real gains before they sign up again.
Say what you will about Arabs, but they are shrewd hagglers.

                    I don’t think they’ll ever sign that deal again.  Not when they can now escape the constant American woke preaching and accept payment in any currency.
They’re already joining BRICS. If the are worried about security, they can work with the Russians, Indians, and Chinese.  None of them have the unpleasant strings attached like American security agreements.

                        The Saudis are hedging their bets. The demise of the petrodollar doesn’t preclude acceptance of dollars at all, which will be necessary for the foreseeable future, but allows flexibility for a future date when that no longer is the case. It seems a quite smart move.

                            Agreed. And they can sign anything they want an renege on it later; it’s done all the time. With those guys, money talks and if Uncle Sam has the cash, they will take all kinds of shit of him the same way you and I would with big customersBut Uncle Sam has other cards to play too. The Saudis are reliant on US weapon systems and a massive US market They will not throw that away.  Nor would they earn ANY street cred among their simian peers by ditching Uncle Sam. Those guys have blood feuds that span centuries and no one will forget how they partnered up with the US against Iraq. Finally, the American market for oil is massive. The Saudis will never allow that market to get away.My guess is that they will use BRICS as a lever to keep Uncle Sam and Uncle Shmuelley honest. It’s what I would do.

                        I would imagine as a condition of joining BRICS, the Saudis would have to agree to whatever financial transaction rules the BRICS institute.  Given that oil is the only thing of value the Saudis have, I can’t imagine countries as smart as Russia and China would allow the Saudis to join without locking down oil in alternative currencies to the dollar.  Non-BRICS countries may still have to use dollars, but I imagine China and India as well as other BRICS members represent a large chunk of Saudi oil buyers, and hence a large market of petrodollars going poof.

                Well, let’s be honest, the Russians are still (sort of) accepting dollars for their oil and nat gas. Sure, you have to pay for them in rubles but how do you get those rubles? You exchange dollars and Euros for rubles, which means that Russia is still getting their dollars and Euros.Regardless, the Russians, Chinese, Indians, Saudis, etc., are slowly, every so slowly, trying to build an alternative trade/finance system to diminish the power of the dollar. That said, it will take time.Also, their biggest problem is that there’s not an alternative to build around. They’re setting up the hardware but don’t have any software to put on it. There’s a reason that the world chose on language – English – to be the global language. It’s just a lot easier than many languages. The same is true for currencies. It’s vastly more efficient and cheaper to have one global reserve currency than to have many.Also, the BRICs have no currency that is in the same universe as the dollar. My guess is that they don’t want to move away from the dollar. They just want alternate ways to access and move dollars. We’ll see.

                    A distinction has to be made between elimination of the petrodollar and the current strength and prevalence of the dollar, no? The Saudis, it seems wisely, are still acknowledging the current supremacy of the dollar and transitioning to a time when it no longer is a necessity, however far off into the future that is.

                        Absolutely. The entire world is looking at how to create alternative systems of trade and finance. It’s just going to take time. Also, the big problem remains that there’s no alternative to the dollar as the GRC.
However, there’s no doubt that countries are trying to move away from treasuries as the way to store dollars. The big buyers of treasuries now are US households, pension funds, insurance and banks – all of which are interest rate sensitive, btw.

                    Only a relatively small amount of rubles are sold directly by Russia. The majority is through trade. Someone must sell goods to Russia and accept payment in rubles. They then use the rubles to buy Russian goods.
Countries who are participating in the sanctions can either sell goods to that country and accept rubles in payment, or can seek to trade for them in a currency market.
In any event, Russia is rewarding countries who don’t recognize the sanctions, or MNCs willing and able to work around them. They get the vig. Well played.

                        True, but that process is very inefficient. You can see why the world prefers one GRC. I don’t think that the BRICs want to get rid of the dollar as the GRC. I think that they just want enough alternative routes to make sanction ineffective. (Some back roads if the US bans them from the interstate.)
Now, if the US refuses to lift the sanctions after the war ends, the RoW will really need to look at building true, fully functional alternative systems. Can’t use back roads forever.

                Washington put some new sanctions in place thinking they could create a run on the ruble. If you cannot easily exchange rubles for dollars or euros after August, then people might start dumping rubles. The Russians cut this off my suspending the exchange, thus forcing out euros and dollars entirely. I believe you can still use the exchange for yuan to dollars and euros and yuan to rubles, so the net will be more yuan to rubles business, which is good for China, but not so good for Western banks.

                    Much like Ukraine has taught Russia how to fight a modern war and test its tactics and equipment, the sanctions are teaching the world how to fight a financial/trade war. The Chinese, Russians, etc., are learning a lot of valuable lessons.
Project Ukraine has turned out to be a complete disaster to GAE, though the neocons, as always, are completely unaware of this fact.

                            To my surprise, this war really is turning into our Syracuse. It’s shown that the West can no longer project military power like it use to. Missiles, ineffective Western equipment, etc., mean that the US can’t push around countries. They can strike back – and hard.
But, yes, the ability to evade sanctions and not keep the economy alive but growing is a massive blow to the US. And that ability will only grow over time.
The two big weapons of the US – the military and trade/dollar sanctions – have proven to be beatable. It’s a new world.

        “Unlike Covid, the collapse of Project Ukraine is not going to be easy to sweep under the rug by ignoring it.”I don’t see how this could be true, especially in America.  Ukraine is just some abstraction and has no impact on anyone here.  Even all the money and weapons we are giving them remain abstractions. Nobody’s taxes went up because of it.  We know we will pay the price eventually, but that remains in the future.  Few are capable of understanding inflation being partially driven by the war in Ukraine (not to mention Covid).But Covid was far from an abstraction and deeply affected all of us.  We were locked in our homes for months.  We were forced to wear diapers on our face and forced to take a shot we didn’t want. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses were deeply harmed by the lockdowns and restrictions.  People were denied the ability to share the last moments of dying loved ones.  The schools shut down. The vaccine passports…  All the inflation and shortages… These and many other impacts to our daily lives and based mostly on BS.When they decided they were done playing this stupid game, crickets.  Nobody has gone to jail.  Nobody even had to apologize.  The only people who lost their jobs were people who refused to take the vax.People just didn’t care.  If they don’t care about covid, they certainly are not going to care about Ukraine.

            Agreed. But, to strengthen your case with a correction, hundreds of thousands of small businesses were not just “deeply harmed,” but absolutely destroyed. I saw it happen. And the elimination of these small businesses redounded to the benefit of the Power Structure’s corporations, it goes without saying. I’m sure that was merely a coincidence…

            Tars,
Excellent. I would upvote 10,000 times if I could. The evil perpetrated during Covid was so great in it’s scope, it may be the worst the world has ever seen; and I’m not being daft.
Consider: theentireplanet went crazy for near on two years. Then, as you say, crickets. They all marched in lockstep, silencing dissent and discrediting people who were correctly skeptical.

            Cool, I hope to see the ME-262’s at an airshow soon. Oh this topic for the essay this morning is bringing back a very nasty argument last night between myself and a friend from Kiev. Summation: He’s livid that Trump won the primaries and that we didn’t do the smart thing and choose Nimrata over OMB. Because the pajeeta had a clear and concise plan for defeating Putler and Trump just wants to be seen shaking hands with another dictator and get his name in the paper.The more I attempted to explain to him that my countrymen have had enough of war and frankly this isn’t our problem, the angrier he became. He attempted to frame his argument in terms of “If something isn’t done, the Chinese will take note and eventually make your country their little bitch!” I didn’t have the patience to tell him that our country – to a certain extent is already China’s bitch. I also didn’t have the patience to carry on the conversation a moment longer because I was a hair’s breadth away from telling him how much I really didn’t give a shit about his country, or what happens to his people.Whenever I see one of those “No more brother wars” memes, I always think back to how this guy and those like him really feel about us as Americans: “We look down on you and always will look down on you, but when we get into trouble, it’s time for you and your people to do the only thing you’re good for, expending your blood and treasure cleaning up our messes.”He became even more enraged when I told him that contrary to what he believes, Putin is NOT going to invade the rest of Europe.

                    Can’t blame ’em since we seem to have the wherewithal to bomb everybody.  It used to be when the Americans showed up they were bringing the Red Cross.
Speaking of Red Cross, a guy went into one of their shipping centers and started opening the supply trunks.  Hundreds of these things, rooms full of them.  Supposedly with bandages, or medicinals, blankets, what have you.
So he starts opening them at random.  One after the other.Money.  Stacks and stacks and stacks of cash in each steamer trunk he opened.  No bandages, no lifesaving supplies.  My god.

                    This is another sore spot. He is here on a work visa and his kids were born here, so they automatically get status. If he goes back, his visa gets cancelled and he can’t return, so he’s here. Oh yeah, any mention of his kids heading over there (his son is 22) gets deflected.He has a younger brother who is over there and I’m getting the bullshit stories about how “Victory is right around the corner”, “The Russians are on their last leg”, “We’ll be in Moscow by the end of the summer/Halloween/Christmas” and any questioning of the narrative is immediately met with, “When did you become a water carrier for Putin?” When one cannot have a normal conversation with another person about a problem, the problem will never get solved. That’s baked into the recipe.Again, the thing that infuriates me the most is when a foreigner living in our country, under our protection is being told that our people and our country are tired and don’t want to bail another country out at this time, the verymentionof such an idea is what enrages them. “What do you mean you’re tired?!? This is what you exist for! Get that rig back on, get on the transports and get back into battle! You have a homeland to secure for (Insert whatever country of your choice here)! I would love to insert a middle finger emoji, or one of an Italian salute here, but I have no idea how to.Forgive the venting, but it’s becoming waaaaaay to friggen tiresome!

Ungrateful foreigners are one of the most tiresome peoples you can imagine.I recall being in a London bar many years ago with a group of people including an obnoxious Brazilian shouting the odds: England is that, England is that, blah, blah. The nerve.When there was a brief silence, to Brazen Brazilian, in earshot of all, I just said: “Remember whose country you’re in.”. Then buggered off to another group.I have to say that the way these people carry on in our lands, and that our government and many people just take it, is so terrible as to make one have warm thoughts of Austrian Painter.

                The Texas Aircraft Factory has built a fewairworthy Me262sfor aerial and static display. They use the same turbojets that power the F-5 Tiger and are even given construction numbers in sequence where the original jets left off by the owners of the Messerschmitt trademark. Saw one at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh (best airshow of the year) and it was definitely a gorgeous bird.

                His country is lost, lost. He’s looking for anything to bring it back.He’s in a stage of mourning. And after all the outright shit those people have had to put up with for generations…
Frankly I’m surprised that the hawks are still out after seeing videos of Ukrainians beating up the conscription crews.  Society-wide trauma conditioning is what it is.

        It really is hard to pinpoint one single event that brought about the dissolution of the Soviet Union, so the cumulative effect of lying along with a series of catastrophes probably is at least a partial explanation. Some have suggested the early message boards and other forerunners of the digital information age played a major role after they became hard to suppress. That does seem plausible. Access to information is not the friend of totalitarianism.Acquaintances who came of age in the old East Bloc have told me that sudden mass awareness of Western prosperity in fact was a key factor in that earlier system’s implosion. That has led me to believe people here, in an eerily similar totalitarian system with burgeoning but futile censorship, will put up with lying and failures until their economic circumstances deteriorate sufficiently. We are seeing a glimpse of that now with the widespread cynicism over deception about the severity of inflation. The discontent is nowhere near a revolt level, of course, but if a deep recession coincides with the forthcoming collapse of Ukraine, things very well may get spicy fast.The Soviet Union at times transferred populations but it never sought explicitly to replace Russians with foreigners. The Great Replacement is very real in the GAE and quite obvious and as a result a similar degree of economic deprivation may not even be as necessary. This could mean a GAE collapse could be just as a sudden as it Soviet counterpart. I’m starting to see that as quite possible. Gorbachev at least tried to head off the USSR’s implosion with perestroika and glasnost. Does anyone think the Regime here is even capable of such attempts?

                You subtilely bring up a difference between the old USSR and today’s USSA—race and religion.
The collapse of the USSR left the repressed Orthodox Church as a rallying institution and the Russian people were intact as a race.  The Church was never poz’d as our religious institutions are.  Yes, there were a number of other peoples in the empire, but they lived in their own territories.  White Russians remained one people, and the major one at that.

                    This is exactly why the current crop of internationalists is so strongly pushing mixing and replacement. They want to destroy the basis of organized opposition against their evil.  It’s also why the deportations and remigrations must be so pitiless.
This is our ‘never again’ moment. Never again should the preconditions for success of internationalist evil be allowed to take root. Never again should the presence of transnational tribalism be allowed to infest European civilization.

        Zero consequences for any pols or generals over 20 years of GWOT; even the Afghanistan pullout debacle barely ruffled any feathers.   This won’t be any different. No Congressional inquiries, no War Powers Act…our Congress loves this stuff.
European leaders are already incredibly unpopular with their bases, but on they go.  “Democracy” wins again.
I am surprised it’s taken Russia so long though.  Hard to tell if this is good or bad?  An unstoppable Russia would frighten the West to it’s senses; a Russia taking this long to finish off Ukraine looks anemic and the West just keeps poking the bear.

That’s it right there; the longer this drags on the weaker Russia looks – whether that’s accurate or not – &amp; increasingly the chance/risk for someone to really fumble the ball/miscalculate that leads to an August 1914 moment.

            Precisely what I said from day one of the conflict.  Russia looked weak, at least initially, and NATO continues to escalate the war and grow bolder in their efforts.  I think there were initial Russian missteps, but not into the second year.  Now I think it’s a hesitancy to accept casualties on the part of Russia that shapes the conflict.NATO, read USA, continues to escalate the war.  This I now believe is the new Neocon plan.  Rather than having been vanquished, the Neocons are in control from the back ground.  The new strategy is to push/escalate until the first nuke pop’s off, then destroy Russia with a complete nuke strike.  I believe they think a nuke war is “winnable”—at least they won’t be touched in their bunkers.

                I’m going to go off the rails here, as is my wont.So I’ve dreamed a vision of the future before, as well as dreaming of living in the vast stretches of city ruins for decades. The kind of lucid dreaming with that certain deja vu ‘feeling’ one gets when you know it’s not a dream or daydream, but a memory. Of someone’s past, or a memory in the future.What I dreamed of, was tunnels. Modern, crowded, very different mores and sense of space, but an intact and functional society. Like a dream of home.There is an entire tunnel city beneath Foggy Bottom and Washington DC.I’ve been in the primitive Kansas City Caves and what is described for DC is far beyond that, a complete city or town. The cave complexes in the eastern US are enormous and far-reaching. Even mining operations, say, salt mines, are pretty mindblowing in their extent and size.They do believe they can survive it. In fact, it may be that I’ve seen their heirs.Both theirs, and ours, in what remains above.

        No government can survive a people that sees their institutions as a deposit of wealth they can loot if they can get away with it. We’re seeing this here in the United States, where hard working people are being made suckers by wealthy hucksters and low-IQ looters. When things get bad enough, those suckers become less and less satisfied with the scraps they get.
It doesn’t matter how brilliant their policies are, nor how draconian their surveillance. It will still be run top-down by people with no loyalty other than looking for the next quick buck.

        The cumulative effect of all this will be something similar to “stagflation,” but whatever the cultural equivalent of that would be.  Things will suck, but nothing will happen other than further grinding disintegration (much like the Ukie military, ironically) because everyone will be beyond caring.

        AmRen covered the anti-white, anti-American Pierre Omidyar – the eBay who came to America and, thanks to America being an open society, became a multi-billionaire. How or why is this relevant to today’s post?Omidyar has been cleverly using his non-profits to perform regulatory capture of the FCC and other important government bodies. He is clamoring for breaking up the tech monopolies and is deeply dissatisfied with how non-inclusive America is. He is building up his DIE sinecure army of comissars. This is a war in the clouds.Will it portend further splits in the oligarchy and moves toward open warfare amongst them? Will he seriously try and break up Google, Facebook, Apple … … ? Is this just a good cop bad cop dog and pony show?A system that permits aliens to come in and be highly successful but then exercise deep and bitter resentment and antipathy toward the people and their society that welcomed them by waging a pogrom and revolution against them is not just illegitimate, it is evil and irreparably broken.Things are going to get crazy here.Well, this is our home, and it is our country. Dig in and do what is needed for the cross generational struggle where we will reclaim it again.As for the inevitable Ukraine defeat, that will be a moment of reckoning between the GAE and its European vassals. Will a beleaguered, decadent, demoralized European people, who have been under biowarfare assault from their rulers rally to be the next set of canon fodder as proxies in a war escalation? Will Americans step up and fight in Ukraine in the numbers that will be required to drive Russia back? Are the oligarchs able to make the sacrifices that war entails to win it or is perpetual growth the highest value.We’ll be getting answers to a lot of questions that won’t reflect well on the state of the self immolating West, to the extent it still is The West, when the reality on the ground in Ukraine hits home.

                On the contrary, they have defeated the faghags and trannies of NATOstan suffering only about 80k casualties, a good quarter of them expendable criminals from their prison system. When you have a real people and a real country, even the criminal trash can find absolution and redemption in martyrdom to their motherland, because even they are sons of that motherland.Their dead are far outnumbered by the 7.5 million new white citizens they have already added to their Federation, with the promise of doubling that when they finish annexing the other genuine Rus areas up to Odessa. Massive new resources come with these people. This is called PROFOUND strategic victory.Rommel and von Mannstein failed and their people fell under International Jew occupation, escaping destruction only because of their obvious utility in the early Cold War. I’m not sure who the real geostrategic brains are in the RF, but Rommel and von Mannstein don’t have anything on them.

                The ability of the Russians to “keep it zipped up” and not overextend themselves to the breaking point is something a lot of people in the past wished they’d thought of first.

            “Asystem that permits aliens to come in and be highly successful but then exercise deep and bitter resentment and antipathy toward the people and their society that welcomed them by waging a pogrom and revolution against them is not just illegitimate, it is evil and irreparably broken.”Absolutely correct, and anyone who believes that there is a solution that does not involve extreme violence is a fool.  Like I’ve said before, all of this banter is just that.  Nothing will change or improve until the tree is watered.  There are only 2 outcomes:The tree is watered and a new country is born.Nothing happens and the rest of American whites are finally eliminated and western civilization plunges into hell far worse than anyone could imagine.Unfortunately, option 2 is far more likely as there has been zero evidence that the march further left is showing any signs of slowing down.

            Majority of people I talk to still believe the official story that covid was a deadly pathogen that somehow became more benign. Most also believe that the vaxx is somewhat effective, but not worth it. A minority keeps taking the boosters.

                Right. Around here, my position is still fairly lonely. Then again, most people are unprincipled bullshitters who blow in the wind. On the bright side, if the vaxx is a selection pressure, it has selected against unprincipled bullshitters!

                Considering myself fairly well read on most things Covid-19, I feel compelled to respond.To the best of my knowledge few explanations, and certainly not the official ones, ever claimed that SARS-CoV-2 was a dangerous pathogen (other than, perhaps initial sensationalist reportage.) The one exception I know of is Ron Unz claiming that it was deployed in Iran early in the pandemic as a bio-weapon, a claim that I don’t find highly credible. I’m aware that some believe it was a bio-weapon (in the mass destruction sense) but, in my opinion at least, that’s well into tinfoil-hat land.The best evidence, granted most of it circumstantial, points to an accidental escape of a more or less routine laboratory experiment. Deliberate release is certainly possible; in fact, my favorite conspiracy theory has pivoted to it HAVING been a deliberate release, but of a virus that was precisely NOT a killer to most people but was highly transmissible and a minor nuisance. More importantly, specialist could easily determine from its genome its artificial origin. What more perfect virus to use? You had a virus lineage that had a paper trail, more or less openly funded by NIH via EcoHealth Alliance, reports in trade journals etc. Getting samples of the virus would have been child’s play for spooks. Seed the virus in a city known to work on such viruses. The Deep State plot, if I’m right, was simply to provide pretext for lockdowns and the other authoritarian crap we’ve endured since 2020. Oh yes, and to make trillions of dollars in the bargain.And did the virus become more benign? It surely did. From the virus’s “point of view” the optimal strategy is to be as infectious as possible while minimizing the cost to the host during the infection. This is basic epidemiology/natural selection/evolution. Killing off your host before he’s had a chance to pass on your progeny is bad for business. [This doesn’t forbid occasional pandemics like the Spanish flu of a century ago that had high fatality rates, but such are probably the exception that proves the rule.]The vaxx: I give you points for more accuracy here. Quite the contrary, early on the public was enthusiastic about the jabs but by now yes it’s sunk into most heads that they don’t work very well and they’re quite unpopular. Oh yes, about that profit motive? Well, Pharma got the mRNA jabs fully approved by the FDA in 2021, so the platform is probably clear sailing for future uses. There still remain those niggling problems about very little proof of safety or even efficacy, certainly not by older standards. And excess deaths still continue well above historical norms, and no one seems in a hurry to inquire why. Only time will tell if the public is gullible enough to take mRNA jabs for other purposes.

                On Christmas Eve 2020 in my hospital we had 20 ICU beds and 48 floor beds converted to ICU beds with COVID patients in them. We ran out of oxygen twice in December.
That was very real, my friend, and nothing remotely like that has happened since.
WHY it changed is controversial. THAT it changed is beyond dispute.
And that has nothing to do with any of the public health/mitigation issues, which by the time the Diamond Princess and USS Theodore Roosevelt data were in in late March 2020 we know were mostly useless or unimportant.

            Tell me this wasn’t covid and notice when it happened……..what else was very recent at that time…….https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic“In January 2010,Wolfgang Wodarg, a German deputy who trained as a physician and chaired the health committee at theCouncil of Europe, claimed that major firms had organized a “campaign of panic” to put pressure on theWorld Health Organization(WHO) to declare a “false pandemic” to sell vaccines. Wodarg said the WHO’s “false pandemic” flu campaign is “one of the greatest medicine scandals of the century”. He said that the “false pandemic” campaign began in May 2009 inMexico City, when a hundred or so “normal” reported influenza cases were declared to be the beginning of a threatening new pandemic, although he said there was little scientific evidence for it. Nevertheless, he argued that the WHO, “in cooperation with some big pharmaceutical companies and their scientists, re-defined pandemics,” removing the statement that “an enormous amount of people have contracted the illness or died” from its existing definition and replacing it by stating simply that there has to be a virus, spreading beyond borders and to which people have no immunity.[117]“

                    organic markets can not exist in an empire.  Take automobiles.  Recently all US automakers gave up on the automobile market except for trucks and SUVs.

Even back in the 90’s and early 2000’s they were very expensive and status symbols for the upper middle class.  Why not anymore?  Desperation for market share, desperation to keep cashflow coming in to service the unservicable debt.  Why else QE and 0% rates?  Though not for you i might add 😉

                                Many of these luxury cars take huge depreciation hits. I know a woman who drives a late model Range Rover. She (and/or husband) are shrewd: I can tell by the license tag the car was bought second hand and (I assume) at a good discount. Of course, you’ll repay some of that in higher repair costs probably.

                            A large part of that callousness is the atomization due to mobility, of the loss of community by means both incidental and intended.
But in reading about Dresden, whose appalling murder was planned by British commanders, I realized there is a way to widely subvert the managerial class.
Make them complicit.Make them complicit in carrying out a wide-scale crime, such as a war, or a vaccination industry, or media chicanery; once a part of such a crime, they can never again be innocent.

            Exactly.
it ties into that final blurb from our esteemed blog host: The Soviet Union collapsed when the rules collapsed. The people have to see that the laws work, and they need to see justice being done when the shysters and incompetent get taken down.
In China, they publicly try corrupt officials and punish them. It’s not uncommon to see carpetbaggers getting shot. The Americans made sure everyone saw “the tree of liberty being watered with the blood of tyrants”. Nothing less can save the US now.

                Absolutely!  Certainly for me, hence the inner longing for a strongman—the concept of “Dictator” from the history of Ancient Rome.Translated into more modern sensibilities, the folks involved in the scamdemic must be tried and imprisoned and have their wealth and credentials confiscated.  They can then be released and allowed to wander through society as a living warning to the wise of the dangers of greed and hubris.  Bring back show trials for these clowns.On the other hand, I’m not hopeful.  After WWII, the Allies rounded up or identified thousands of NAZI’s for trial, yet abandoned the process after a couple of years.  People can have too much justice for their limited attention span I guess.

                    The WW II trials were a different situation – they were largely shams to begin with, and the big difference: The losers were on trial, not the people in control (who were far worse).  People in control don’t get tried.

        Thomas Massie has a fascinating interview with Tucker Carlson in which he says Congress is being completely manipulated by the Executive Branch on Ukraine.He claims that in “classified briefings” where Members cannot even bring staff they are being fed total lies by the DOD, the CIA and State. Massie says that the spooks bring in impressive Russian casualty figures to entice Congress into paying to kill Russians, then claim that they don’t know what the Ukrainian casualty numbers are, which Massie laughs off as an obvious lie.It’s really worth watching the entire interview… it’s an absolute travesty that a guy like Massie is only one out of 535.https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1799124990643626065

            Watched parts of that interview with my husband.  I was very surprised and impressed by Massie – knew nothing about him previously.  He lays out how AIPAC gradually ensnares all the congresscretins and how he refused to bend the knee.  He was a prepper when the term was almost unknown, and happily goes home to Kentucky every weekend.  Definitely concur the interview is well worth the time.

        Instead of the public going after the lying liars with pitchforks and torches, they’re mainly just ignoring what the tards in the media complex are blabbing about.  The vast majority don’t give two s**** about Ukraine and maybe one s*** about Jews massacring Palestinians.  But by and large, one cares.
On another note, I read today that the vaunted US kick ass aircraft carrier Eisenhower is heading out of the Red Sea theater, supposedly damaged by Houthi missiles – good.  The sooner everyone around the world recognizes what a paper tiger the government here has become, the better.

            I take some interest in theEisenhowercase. I did some searching (including on Yandex) and found similar information. The apparent lack of anything substantive from Navy/DoD (e.g. “proof of life”) would seem to fan the conspiracy theory flames just a bit, to say the least. On the other hand, Russia Today apparently hasn’t said anything about the incident since May 31. Of course, that could be easily explained: the Navy would never publicly disclose a ship taking major damage and the Russkis would not disclose they had such intelligence if they do.

        Very good post by Z-man.  My only quibble is that I know of no prominent European politicians who have taken a position in opposition to the war, except perhaps Victor Orban (Hungary) and Robert Fico (Slovakia).  I think that the Alternatif fur Deutschland party and Sarah Wagaknecht’s party have also been critical of the war, but I think the present attitude of the German government may be to try and outlaw both parties.Here in France the political class, including even Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour have been supporters of the war.  The exception has been a little known politician named Florian Phillipot.  My point is that it may be difficult for public disillusion with Project Ukraine to coalesce without a leader to articulate the catastrophe that this has been.

        Where the lies are being exposed is in entertainment/culture. In a deeply atomized society, one far more individualized with people as “all alone” beings menaced by Bigness: GovCorp, GovNGO, GovCulture etc, this matters more than you’d think as people’s emotions get tied up things they saw and loved as kids.The latest Star Wars series “the Acolyte” posits black lesbian communist space witches (not kidding you) as the well spring of the force and able to create kids sans turkey baster. Not kidding either. Fan reaction has been unified “f-off series.” And the critics and shills have gone into their usual playbook of “racist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc.” accusations that work wonders inside Disney but have no effect on Joe Normie. Joe Normie looks at a literally fake and gay Star Wars and says the entire regime can get “f-ed” .. false in things closest to his emotions, false in all.In that sense the destruction of stuff he loved as a kid might matter more than the fall of KEEEEEEEVVVVVVV! [Yes I know its stupid. But people feel what they feel.]Also, hilarious FT copium from Ed Luce. In between coded appeals to end elections because “people are stupid and voting for Trump as Caesar” he admits that young men, even young men of color, are drifting rightwards. Because college and its rewards are now exclusively female, as is the leadership of the GAE. He posits this as a good thing, its happening you bigots, and you deserve it. He offers no solutions or any path for young male ambition, especially those on the whiter shade of pale.

            Of course the answer for lies being exposed as lies, and the loss of faith is implicitly the mercenary army imported by “newcomers” aka illegal aliens.
The general idea being that these will be the men under arms, from whose gun barrels power flows. Per the Regime’s great inspiration, Mao.

            The thing that regime shills and hangers-on don’t understand.. is that if it is necessary for an American Caesar to come to put this cursed country back in line with the natural and moral law… then an American Caesar will come. No matter what sinecures they will lose by it, or how many feminists/juice screech over it, it will happen. Because a people cannot function outside of objective reality forever.

        Ukrainian population went from 52 million in 1992 to ~28 million in what’s left of Ukraine today. Success?Even if a miracle happens and they somehow reconquer all the lost territories, the country will be destroyed and will never recover, especially with today’s birthrates.
Btw, if another, much smaller, miracle happens, then the “far-right” will win a majority in France in less than a month. Could get interesting.

            It is hard to see how Le Pen could attain power without an outright 50-plus majority win. Doable, maybe, but the political structure certainly is geared to forestall it. The same applies to AfD in Germany.

        “In Europe, the political class has made Ukraine a test of their legitimacy.”
Since the EU, the Euros are on their fourth crisis. First was the GFC and the Greek/Cyprus/Portugal insolvency. Second was the migration crisis, which of course is ongoing. The third was Covid. Fourth is Ukraine. And in each instance the Euro Elites have screwed up royally. So it’s now 17 years of continuous calamity. The surprise is that they’ve been able to keep this sh*t-show on the road for this long.

        Let’s say the European public, en masse, concludes–rightly–that its rulers mendacious lackeys for the BFE. Then what? At least AINO’s public is armed to the teeth, albeit with small arms. Europeans have nothing more than slingshots and shillelaghs. Maybe unarmed mass protests and strikes would drive the treasonous ruling class from its lairs. One can hope, I suppose.

                    Europeans were completely emasculated in 1945 – even the “winners” of the conflict were forced to bend the knee to the American Empire, although DC gave the UK and France the opportunity to larp as world powers. So they’ve been completely demilitarized and have lived for multiple generations under the thumb of globohomo. There is no nascent warrior class like the one that continued in the USA in the south after-WW2 (although now the rulers hate that). They’ve not had to pay for their security or safeguards for decades and instead got a bloated welfare state to take care of their troubles.The modern European is entirely a creation of the American empire, which is why, say, the Germans didn’t say a peep when the Americans blew up their pipeline last year.

        I can’t tell you how many times I’ve read about the new American superweapon that is going to bring Putler to his knees. At this point I cannot imagine there are many true believers anymore. The ones still talking like this have either their ego on the line or are just trying to get a piece of the looting operation that it has become (this includes the think tanks). The fact that it trudges on shows what a disconnect there is between the government institutions and the people in our “sacred democracy.”The dynamic in Europe must be taken in the context that these are all just vassals to the American empire. There are so many layers of bureaucracy and institution that is designed to separate the people from the true decision-makers, who are in Washington DC. Yea, they’ll get thrown to the wolves if need be, but the $60 billion was designed to keep t his going long enough that people get bored and lose interest, as happened in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq.

        The general public was simply happy to get back to normal. That is probably not going to work with Ukraine as there is no benefit to putting the topic in the past. There will simply be what the media claimed to be true and the truth, which is the opposite.
There is the real possibility that the general public just doesn’t care about Ukraine and will not bother asking questions if the government just stops very publicly* sending our money to Ukraine.
*We all know they’ll continue to send boatloads of cash secretly, because that’s just what AINO does.

I believe that this possibility you mention is a near certainty. From my perspective, hardly anyone cares. Nobody mentions it, nor even alludes to it. Of course, the papers talk about it, but it seems to have been eclipsed by the Jew-Moslem Desert War.

        “One of the lessons of the Soviet era was that the accumulation of lies eventually saps even the most repressive regime of legitimacy.”
That’s only one part of the lesson the other part has to do with Levi’s Jeans. Because it wasn’t a free society, it did not have the freedom to innovate like a free society can. Therefore, they had a lower standard of living and lower quality goods they could buy on the shelves. If they were living fat and happy, they wouldn’t care what their government did, so long as it didn’t affect them.

Added bonus, he has a personality and is able to talk to women.If we lived in the country I grew up in (“America”), I would encourage him to go into nuclear design/ maintenance.  These piles of controlled fission are NOT going to take care of themselves.Unfortunately, we live in The GAE/ AINO.  I am pushing him into being an actuary/ investment banker.  He and my legions of unborn grandchildren will have plenty of resources to be far, far away from a nuclear meltdown.  Also, I’m sure the diversity and strong independent women will be able to take care of things.

            It’s a race so to speak.  Symbol manipulators will accrue wealth, but come up short when tasked with survival when “polite” society ceases to need such effort.

                Much agree.  Please encourage him in the hard STEM of energy sciences- his people will need that far more than a McMansion and McDollars.
There are endless technical specialties beyond the core units. The son of my Vietnam veteran friend didn’t go gallivanting about with his Navy buddies, he stayed with the nuclear submarine and spend a year learning everything he could about the related systems.  He was aiming for a $400K/yr job in the nuclear industry, but was turned down because DIE.  A real blow it was.
Still, DIE and power don’t mix.  Competence will only grow in value.

        I now believe I have heard nothing but propaganda from both sides. I can’t believe anything any more.

            Propaganda from both sides.  ‘struth!  We’ve been hearing of Ukraine’s imminent collapse as long as we’ve been hearing of Ukraine’s new wunder-waffen.Who knows the situation on the ground?  But: There is no way Ukraine can win. No way***Given that blinding truth, and that there are no meaningful negotiations going on, tells one that this is just a racket for the West.  Probably, the Russians have a clear objective at this point and are working methodically towards it.  Western shenanigans are just a distraction, but a potentially catastrophic one if there is a miscalculation.***[If anyone can present a plausible scenario for Ukrainian victory, I would love to hear it.  Seriously].

            Don’t fall for that, it causes you to lose hope. There is always hope and anyway Russian side is being pretty honest about the war.

            The propaganda from the Russian side seems far less.  It appears comes more from the Russia supporters/Ukraine collapse hopers more than from the Russians themselves.  Mostly folks who think Russia isn’t moving fast enough and destroying everything.  But the Russians have their own objectives and methods.

            Geemaneez.  And what kind of a name is Hamish de Bretton-Gordon?  Moroccan, French, and English?  Is it a name like Barak Hussein Obama?

                I think Hamish is actually Scottish. De Bretton sounds Norman, and Gordon is a good Limey gin name.
