        Good morning Z,If it turns out there’s any human applications for these findings then the crisis of college tuition is solved.I believe it’s perfectly legal for 18 year old adults to sell their ‘youthful’ blood. A pint of healthy blood at say $5,000.00 doesn’t seem unreasonable if it actually works as a fountain of youth.You can give blood about every six weeks – So, eight pints a year is $40K – Pretty much free tuition for any healthy, non drug addled, college bound kid.This means that colleges will have a new excuse to raise tuition and maybe even require that their students also ‘donate’ their blood as part of their “Community Service” requirement.Of course the government will also have to step in to regulate this ‘exploitation’ of the nation’s youth – ‘For the Children’-etc, etc. So, lots more jobs in the Department of Blood. If you’re young, your blood will become a ‘national resource’.Then there will of course be demands for ‘blood equity’ from the diversity crowd.(More work for the Dept of ‘Justice’.)If true, it should all be very entertaining….

        The selfishness of Boomers? Really?Keep an eye on producers and “entertainers”appealing to sophistry retarded “public positions”. When you see a “sudden interest” in demanding “other people” finance and build new orphanages, with subsequent adoption campaigns after a “few years” in response to their “sudden concern” for abortion alternatives for poor, minority, oppressed, wage-hampered, PIV raped, “free” PhD-denied, (fill in the blank) trapped/addicted-with no way out, greatest promise for “our” future…You’ll know they’ve been sold on the “latest” medical regimen for eternal youth, put fourth by “specialists” to the stars.Or maybe they watched re-runs of “The Immortal”, or been instructed what to say in justification of avoiding the population tipping point, from the scripts of “Coma” or (various renditions of)”The Omega Man”.There’s a reason that “groomers”, of all sorts, THROUOUT HISTORY, have  gravitated to disingenuous “in the interests of the children”. I like to think at least MOST 90+IQ “boomers”(as a generation+), despite non, or reinvented history lessons, have experienced enough “NEW STUDIES SHOW….” to practice discrimination in assigning abhorrence to such new Big Idea “solutions”.Steady stream (ie)twitter, and Late Night “comedian”, educated folks, with only “Wiki” as a reference source? Well…IMHO, it’s just “Give us your young…” by moving the decimal point.
