        […] did a series of posts on Africa a long time ago and one of them listed the intentional homicide rates. Sub-Saharan Africa has some outlandish murder rates, but they are consistent with what we see in […]

        But why did Gaddafi keep his would-be immigrants home? Money. He blackmailed the EU for huge sums of “aid” or else he’d turn a blind eye to those wishing to migrate north. It was a game to him, however.
“We have 50 million Muslims in Europe. There are signs that Allah will grant Islam victory in Europe – without swords, without guns, without conquests. The fifty million Muslims of Europe will turn it into a Muslim continent within a few decades.” — quote by Gaddafi from a speech given in 2006.

        A place on one of those rickety boats doesn’t come cheap. It’s not the huddled masses that are coming, it’s the grifters who know the ropes. Tow them back to the 20 mile limit and leave them enough gas to make shore, or ask for advice from the Australians.

            I was in Chicago during the Bush years listening to Tony Snow hold court in a hotel bar. I got bored with that and struck up a conversation with an Aussie who was at the bar. He explained their immigration policy to me. He was flabbergasted at our approach. I mentally made a note that Australia could be a refuge if things fall apart here in the US.

                Could be? I am surprised that more white Americans aren’t flocking to Australia. No snow, no violent blacks or Hispanics, affordable healthcare, cool cars, soccer is in its rightful place as a minor sport, beef, no beggars or homeless annoying you and Australian chocolate ruins the American version. Beer though is on about the same level. For every white American you send, we will swap two Lebanese and throw in a Sudanese.

        The other day I was talking to some members of my family about the sinking of an overstuffed rust bucket of a ship ferrying sub-saharans to a new life in Italy. Of course it is a tragedy because those people might have stayed home and maybe even nada life, whatever the murder rate is back home.They all started with “It’s tragedy” as we are all expected to, and then I voiced a little dissent.Our silly leaders in the west thought they were being smart and got rid of Ghaddafi (or Gadafy or Qadafi or whatever) and cleverly uncorked the genie in the bottle. Sorry, I meant the many genies in the bottle. Tens of thousands if not eventually millions of genies. So they come north, paying criminals to take them either to a watery grave or a refugee camp in Italy. Of course Italy is essentially, like a lot of southern EU countries, already broke and soon the camps will have to be moved to say Belgium or Poland or even Britain.No reason why they shouldn’t build a refugee camp outside, say, Downing Street (Horse Guards Parade would be better, or in full view of Buck House) but I jest. Of course they won’t. Some poor traditional, pleasant British village will shortly be receiving their quota of Somalis. They can’t go to places in the north like Bradford as the resident muslims there won’t tolerate it. But the ordinary pale Brits will have to.The tragedy is that it will go on, because word gets back that the west will pay for people to live. In time the newcomers will get annoyed because British society won’t accept them and Al-Beeb will lead the news on how shocking it is that ordinary Brits haven’t welcomed the refugees into their homes. To help, the lefty media will give one or two of them token jobs to show that being lefties they care but generally the burden will fall on the ordinary people who never voted for this, and anyway wouldn’t be allowed a say.
