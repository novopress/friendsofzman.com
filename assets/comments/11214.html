        This will not end well is a rejoinder I hear often on a lot of topics of our demise.This from T.S. Elliot focuses it better for me:“If we take the widest and wisest view of a Cause, there is no such thing as a Lost Cause, because there is no such thing as a Gained Cause. We fight for lost causes because we know that our defeat and dismay may be the preface to our successors’ victory, though that victory itself will be temporary; we fight rather to keep something alive than in the expectation that it will triumph.”

        Facebook et al will do what they have the power to do within their borders. I say let them. The dissident, realism-centered right has one powerful thing going for it: truth. Efforts to suppress it only emphasize its moral high ground and encourage its followers to continue the fight to keep it alive.  (#David_Wright, #T.S. Elliot).

                I respectfully disagree. I’m with Churchill: The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is. Winston Churchill

                    Third and forth century Romans knew the truth, and that the truth was that they were exhausted morally, culturally, and intellectually. No one expected to turn that beast around, and no one did. Truth and winning are not colors that mix well in every case. Hoffer–“To most of us nothing is so invisible as an unpleasant truth.” Enjoy it like an old book nobody else wants to read.

                The truth might be hidden or obscured, but that is a different thing than the truth not existing at all.
Rev Hoagie, I assume you are being slyly sarcastic.
Keep in mind that major elements in our culture (much of government, many corporations, the media, and pretty much everyone on the left) have a vested interest in obscuring and denying what you can see with your own eyes and know in your own heart.  Don’t give them that power over you.

        What’s missing from the equation now are the independent rating services like those from the legacy media such as Nielsen, etc.  It is astonishing that Facebook etc are allowed to self-report their stats.  The potential for self-dealing ought to be obvious to all.
So how is that business guys are now Ok with being conned on their ad buys_?   Affirmative Action convergence of their marketing departments_?

                Yeah, I agree that at least they think they are and that’s all that matters to them right now, not the stockholders ‘for shurrr’.It’s likely to be another case similar to the print media at the dawn of the internet.  Those folks then were so intent on status-signaling to their peers how ‘khuull’ they were that they excitedly gave away their stockholder’s content for free on the web.  Anyone remember ‘information wants to  be free, mahhnnn’_?Old farts’ warnings at the time that this was wrecking their business model only served to show them just how righteous they were.  And, after all they layoffs, a number of them tried to put the info-genie back into the paywall bottle.  But none of them ever admitted that it was a big mistake, AFAIK.IOW, yet another Principle-Agent Problem in Econ Speak.

        Happy to report I didn’t understand most of that, nor do I want to. The important and productive side of my life has always been three-dimensional (four if you insist on time being a dimension), and I intend to keep it that way.

        Heh.  Baudrillard was right after all, and there’s no unmediated reality.  I do wonder, though, if folks like us are missing something because we’re old.  We grew up in a meatspace world.  I see lots of college kids’ social media pages (professional hazard), and it doesn’t bother them at all to have 2-4K “friends” — in fact, most of them do.  I forget the name of the study that “proved” this (Murphy number? something like that), but nobody can invest emotional energy in that many people.  Whatever function those 4K names (and their neverending assault of likes, shares, etc.) serves, it’s not something we geezers intuitively understand.  If real college kids are as fake as all their fake college kid friends, I guess I’m trying to say, does it matter?  Remember, Big Brother didn’t even bother with the proles. “It was just an ‘opeless fancy…..”

            Dopamine….  friending / digital reinforcement provides a dopamine response just like the rats in the cocaine experiments.  I’d also say its the expansion of meat-space social networks into digital space.  So yes they matter but probably not anywhere near as much as the digital junkies my think.

        Another example of a simulacrum, where fake is substituted for real. Not only does fake exist, but it pushes the real out of the picture.  Pay attention and be aware.  Knowing what is really going on is half the battle.

        Most likely, the reason that Facebook beat MySpace was that it was easier for Facebook users to keep score of the number of friends they had and see how that stacked up to others… People know who they are by reputation.Indeed. I imagine the main reason Facebook beat MySpace is this: Facebook started at Harvard and was only available to Harvard students; then it expanded to a few other ‘prestigious’ universities; then it allowed employees of high-profile tech companies (Apple, Microsoft) who were most likely alumni of those universities to join; only after that did they open membership to anyone. A kind of ‘trickle down’ status. MySpace, however, was open to everyone pretty much after they started.

        Fakery is a minor malady in the world of social networking. It’s real pathology is embodied in it’s use as a tool of memetic indoctrination. Repetitive messaging (particularly coupled with other forms of brain stimulation) can be used to implant thoughts and behaviors without the willful intent of the recipient. This science is now being used to grow the hive.

        Maybe it’s not just that the SM sites are promoting the cat ladies because the want to but because they are being paid to promote that content.
The Obama era included a lot of court deals with big banks where big bank execs got off Scott free while their companies paid big settlements, including to ‘neighborhood’ groups promoting social justice.  No one knows where all this cash went.

            The social media site hosts are not friends of free thinking, independent people.  They want people dependent on them for exposure, clicks, and social validation (friending, up arrows, etc).  Herd ’em up and keep them on the reservation.  We are not a target market, as we are a nuisance, from the host’s perspective.

            Very good point- it’s an Industry, with depth, money, and manpower, working with other State Industries such as legal, admin, compliance, and surveillance.
Until the judges and lawyers get some risk in making their imperious demands, the money will keep flowing.

            There seems to be a civil war of sorts brewing in the marketing world. On one side are the “SEO Strategy” guys and their social media campaigns. On the other is the traditional ad men who like to tie marketing to actual revenue. The big browser makers are now colluding to block a lot of ads, for example. Their reasoning is that the fake ad men are discrediting the ad business. The next good Chrome will have an ad blocker baked into it.

                A war that makes little sense.  People still prefer to buy what they know and trust. SEO provides a list of choices. The Smart Co/Brand has separate campaigns to build the brand and to do the SEO. They work together to get the results needed. Here’s a list of 3 great widgets.  The 2nd widget is a brand I trust so that’s likely where the customers $ gets directed.One thing Amazon does is their version of Fakery.  If your product is successful on their platform (they have all the data and know which products are Uber successful) they will all of the sudden have your product with the Amazon brand attached.If Amazon ever gets taken down in court it will be over this monopolistic behavior.

            Hmmm. A leftist has set up dimwits, dullards, and dolts to discredit them? Who could have seen it coming.Still, a competent, charismatc leftist might have more ambitious plans to advance his political career by manipulating frustrated right wingers of modest knowledge and understanding. So Trent Denton had better get off his Aeron office chair and start showing his face at right wing events if he wants to secure a low level place in the leadership of the emerging American national communism movement. You can do it, Trent!Meanwhile, the rest of you would be wise to educate yourselves about the obvious direction that your movement is taking.The Mystery of Fascism:Mussolini – as he would like to have been rememberedBy David Ramsay Steelehttp://www.la-articles.org.uk/fascism.htmNote well the author’s remarks about most of the rank and file of Fascism having no leftist background. Many of the rank and file, however, did have a military background, and the intensely communistic culture of a military prepared them rather well to be used by heretical, impatient revcommies like Mussolini, who was a veteran, too. We should expect contemporary revolutionary commies to attempt a similar movement by manipulating the USA’s many, many “conservative” veterans and militia nuts, who are probably more leftist than is polite to mention when having cocktails with Democrats. Maybe the go-getter will be also an officer of the military who has resigned his commission.

            Wow, I must be psychic or something.
Actually, no.  The use of provocateurs has been standard issue commie tactics for over 120 years.  Just like the use of jammed-up informers has be standard issue police tactics since forever.  The latter matters if the police are not even close to being neutral much less on your side, as demonstrated in VA.
Doesn’t mean you should attack them (bad idea on many levels), just be aware that they are likely present.  So do not indulge violent rhetoric.

                There are “60+ Jason Kessler profiles” on LinkedIn. So maybe Jason the Obamacrat Kessler is not the Jason Kessler of Unite the White.P.S. If an American cop isknowinglydoing bully work for communists, then it deserves to be stopped without the blustering type of warning for which right wingers are notorious. If a subtle warning makes a naïve cop into a nervous wreck, then good. It’s become less useful to lefty and his corporatocratic counterpart. If the tax eating goon is hurt during leftist mob action, then better, for it, the cop, shouldn’t be exempt from the effects of ruining “domestic Tranquility” while pretending to insure it, too.Wherever secular communism is deprived the service and protection of cops, secular communists are less served and less protected.

        “Fake news and fake social media are just modern incarnations of the old propaganda films from the previous era, just updated to make people think distrusting foreigners and rooting for your own team is weird and unnatural.Regardless of cause and effect, this will not end well.”Well, you either do what they are doing and keep people who inevitably will keep perceiving them as different from their neighbours (maybe because… they are), or separate people.Not a viable option to keep diverse people together while saying the truth about the differences.If it doesn’t work within the single family, why would it have to in a state?Of course mainstream — and mainline — science (in so far as it has social relevance), “information”, and anything else, are instruments of governance, disassociated from truth — and the quest for truth.Nothing new, as I am glad you note.

        When I joined Instagram,my first comment was to a trull, where I said her vanity was a drug.The word “drug” activated a preemptive censorship mechanism, I was asked my phone number “for confirmation”. I denied it them and left the site.However, I clicked the link to their Terms and Conditions.Repeatedly, the word “sincerity” was laid the stress on there.I could not help but think it was in a spirit of irony, and still hold it in no doubt.Irony can be a vent for sadism, power engenders sadism.There are — of course unnoted to the masses and the normal, the faithful and the fearful as some denote them — fragments of power-sadistic irony disseminated through the OKCupids, Twitters, Instagrams, …Humans are that which they are. If today’s winners became losers, and the losers won, they’d swap behavior too.

When will the president take a stand against homegrown terrorism?
Like Leonard Pitts and Van Jones constantly point out, white men are the major terrorist group terroriszing the country. NOT Muslims who are a peaceful people marginilzed by Christian bigotry for centuries

            Um, Trent, Muslims are not peaceful, but they are Christian pests, like some other untrinitarian people e.g. Arians. You see, Muslims affirm that Jesus is the messiah promised by the Jews to theirselves, and anyone who does so counts as a Christian.It’s by the way that I have some exciting news for you.Taco_Town is entirely out of the closet.http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=11203#comment-39817TT awaits, however, a competent leftist to lead Fascism to power. Interested in taking the job? Read my remark about the mystery of Fascism and let Mussolini, as remembered by a former commie, David Steele, show you how it can be done.It will suffice to say that Steele has no interest in competing against you, which is good for you since it’s obvious that you’re basically just a gnat.Hurry up. Don’t wait. One day CNN will be eating out of your hand.
