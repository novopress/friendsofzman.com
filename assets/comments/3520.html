        I have a daughter who does lab. medicine in a large west coast teaching University hospital.  They have a few Africans, from Africa, working there and they are awful.  One I am thinking of does as little as she can, was trained on ancient machinery, and lectures others constantly.  Etc.  And lab results are supposed to be accurate.Now in the local pharmacy, I avoid the ones that hire Chinese girls.  They are not into service.  Rude, imperious and stupid.

        re: Imported African PharmacistsI am also discovering the American Health Care System now that I am on the down side of life.Just about a year ago I had a total hip replacement. Total success I might say and twelve years of increasing pain vanished. Part of the therapy was that I was placed on coumadin for four weeks to prevent a pulmonary embolism. After discharge from the hospital on day three I was instructed to visit the hospital‚Äôs satellite office for a finger stick clotting test twice a week while I was on coumadin to have the clotting monitored. I did that as scheduled and I had an African pharmacist as the person monitoring my clotting. He was as careful as he could be and dutifully twice a week increased my dose as I always tested lower than the therapeutic level until on my last visit after four weeks and still not fully coumadinized I was told to stop taking the drug since I was only supposed to be on the medicine for that four weeks. He never got the point: THAT I WAS NOT GIVEN ENOUGH COUMADIN TO ACTUALLY PREVENT A CLOT. He was actually there to 1) PROTECT the hospital showing some standard of care by going through the motions and, 2) Just be checking that I was not OVER MEDICATED by too much thinning which could result in my expiring.I told my sister the Internist Professor (Retired) about the episode and she laughed saying that the imported Drs., pharmacists and nurses from Africa are known for being dull and ill trained but in this climate of Credentialism all that matters is the DOCUMENT to the Government and licensing boards.Dan Kurt

        That‚Äôs a rich post Mr.Z. I was in West Africa once and my host told me when a car gets in an accident the police don‚Äôt come, ambulances don‚Äôt come; you deal with it yourself. Of course who wants to go to a West African hospital anyways.

        ‚ÄúMassachusetts, if you can tolerate the liberalism‚Äù. Noooooooooooo!!! I fled that uber Land of the Liberal 10 years ago because I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. We do visit relatives there and spend 2 weeks on the Cape, though. It‚Äôs such a shame that a state with so much to offer has to be so liberal.

            I loved living in New Hampshire. I like the winter so that does not bother me. What I really liked is the near total indifference those old Yankees have for their fellow man. No one felt any need to be in a community or share anything with one another. Mind your own business and don‚Äôt be a pest was the prevailing culture. I like that.Mass has a lot going for it, but the liberal loonies are hard to take. I have very dear friends who joined the cult and it is like watching someone get addicted to drugs. There‚Äôs nothing you can do but hope they snap out of it before it is too late.

        A right-winger is something like a black conservative, less than five percent of the population. A person has to be willing to be the only one of his type in the room and be good with that. A wry sense of humor helps, and the ability to be amused instead of outraged. I‚Äôm working on that.

        I‚Äôve always marveled at the fact that people will spend big bucks on their hair and then complain that (fill in the blank with some cheap product everybody uses) costs too much. I‚Äôm one of those black girls with a name easy to pronounce and hair that I didn‚Äôt spend $1,000.oo on.
Zman, this is one of the funniest blogs I‚Äôve ever read. And no, I didn‚Äôt take offense. I‚Äôm not easily offended. üôÇ

        Pharmacy school is where failed doctors and dentists go.  Smart people but not smart enough.  My friend, make a move.  Go to where the white people live.  I moved from the black mecca ‚ÄúAtlanta‚Äù a few years ago and am still marveling at how polite white people are.  It was worth the expense and transition trauma.  It is nice to be among my own. Even the blacks here (panhandle Florida) are respectful and courteous.  I will concur however that black drivers, especially the women, are rude.  Other than that move my friend, move.

        Michael was likely a pharma tech and not a pharmacist. The tech position is low level but the pharmacist position requires rigorous schooling and a high IQ.

        ‚ÄúAnyone who has been to the third world knows that driving in those places is a life altering adventure.‚ÄùRelevant tale: someone I know had cause to go to Uganda and was incensed when the car they were in was pulled over by a local cop and the driver ‚Äòfined‚Äô on the spot. Not a huge amount, and no offence had been committed from what this man could see, but the petty ‚Äòfine‚Äô was duly paid and the driver continued the journey.The reason? You see, said the black driver, it‚Äôs all down to colour. You are white and the police think you have lots of money. So they like to stop a car with a white guy in and issue small fines for some imagined driving misdemeanour. Better to pay up and they wave you on. Sure, it‚Äôs really a bribe but that‚Äôs how Africa works.Small bribes here and there, and whitey pays without question.
