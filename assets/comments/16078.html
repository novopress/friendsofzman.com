        Excellent!
And I have adopted your practice of calling DC ‚Äúthe Imperial City‚Äù.  That is exactly how they see it.  And they view the rest of the country, outside of a few other big cities, as back-water provinces of the empire.  Places that can keep their opinions to themselves and the tax-dollars flowing into the Imperial coffers.

        Speaking of Tucker Carlson, everyone should buy and read his book, Ship of Fools.  Along with being an acute socio-political diagnostician he‚Äôs pushing the radical concept that being part of any elite entails *obligations*, not just privileges.  The horror_!I must be really, really slow, but after reading it, the lightbulb *finally* went off about what was driving most of the campus unrest and radical feminism that I saw all around me in the late ‚Äô60s.  **It was the incoming elite rebelling against assuming their obligations.**Along with most of my Boomer contemporaries I lacked an elite background and upbringing.   So we were completely baffled as to why some of the most privileged people on the face of the planet throughout the course of human history (white female elite college students, in particular) could be so pissed off against the system that spawned them.As an elite female your obligations were to live your mother‚Äôs life: Marry, maintain a nice home, produce heirs and spares for the next generation of the elite, help your husband‚Äôs career through the social networking of the day, run the local charitable organizations, etc., etc.  No way_!  They didn‚Äôt want to help *a* man. they wanted to be *the* man.As an elite male, sure you had the inside track into being *the* man, but first you were obligated to serve your family, city, country. etc.  Nobody in your parent‚Äôs circles got very far in politics if they hadn‚Äôt been in WWII and maintained (at least the appearance of) a stable family, for example.  But the ‚Äòbest and brightest‚Äô had really served up a dog‚Äôs breakfast in SE Asia, all the while pulling strings to exempt their own particular male progeny from danger.  It felt like a suckers deal to serve and yet contemptible to skate.  And license was far more fun than (semi) sober monogamy.  Sex, drugs an rock and roll baby_!What better way to eliminate the cognitive dissonance while maintaining the fun and privileges that were likely to (and did) come your way in the future than adopting the pose of radicalism_?  Solved another one_!  Shows why we should be in charge_!But there were downstream consequences, as Tucker points out.

                Otis;Donno.  Just read it.  But I‚Äôll say already that the book can be useful to even those ‚Äòpilled‚Äô ‚Äôcause it helps to know how and why the pill is the color it is.
IOW, it‚Äôs really not just waste of time to ‚Äòpreach to the choir‚Äô because repetition and variation help cement understanding and firm up conviction.

        ‚ÄúRather, they see us as a threat to their status as active citizens.‚Äù
And that is the mask that has been removed. I was speaking with a couple of blue collar workers yesterday. They are in complete agreement that the nation has fallen under the power of an unelected elite that no longer possess any moral authority. I was somewhat surprised that this realization had already seeped so deeply into the consciousness of the common man. That was encouraging. And somewhat disquieting. Things will not go back to what they were. An adversarial relationship between citizenry and bureaucracy portends tyranny.

            I doubt any society exists without an insular elite whose morality is alien to the masses. What is unqiue in the case of your country, or western countries generally, is that you have a very difficult time identifying your elite. It may well be that the US has no effective elite and the current scenario is just the petty bougousie stealing everything that isn‚Äôt tied down.

                Insular insofar as they relied upon a layer between themselves and the rabble. That layer was not impenetrable. Information could pass through, so the feedback was there. It was not so long ago that the bourgeois lived within eyesight of the lower classes. Their children would serve together in the army and maybe even attend the same public schools. Today, the typical member of the managerial class grew up in a swank suburb, went to private schools and then private colleges.
Oddly, this is why the alt-right exists. Most of them grew up in comfy suburbs and then experienced vibrancy.

                    I certainly would not disagree that your managerial class was at one point much better acquainted with the working class. As I said; however, I presume an elite above your managerial class is responsible for taming said bougie class. The bougousie has been in closer proximity to the proles but they certainly never liked them. It was the role of the elite to ensure class comity sufficient to prevent the sorts of things happening in the modern west: importing an alien helot army to destroy your class enemies.

                Issac, our elite used to give lip service to the middle class, and not steal them blind.  Sort of a mutual survive-and-thrive strategy.  That is all over now, and the shakedown continues.  If the old rules were still in play, Hillary would be a two-bit attorney in Little Rock, and Trump would be playing golf somewhere.

        It‚Äôs not just our overlords who no longer look out for American citizens‚Äô interests, but the citizens themselves who will increasingly withdraw from civic engagement as America becomes more multicultural and is thought of as not a homeland, but more of an international shopping mall.

        There is one venue where a tyrannist government will miraculously become motivated and competent, and that is in defense of it‚Äôs own existence. When the time comes to round up the dissenters and put them into a gulag, they will be very highly organized, capable, and ruthlessly efficient. Even before that, they will implement a divide and conquer strategy using false flag events to instigate blue-on-green decimation (patriot vs. LEO), and thereby whittle down the opposition. This will be preceded by selective arrests of the presumed ringleaders. You can‚Äôt beat them by playing their game. A new paradigm is necessary.

        Including the media as the elites, this morning‚Äôs NPR‚Äôs coverage of Trump‚Äôs immigration speech last night had only two angles ‚Äì From immigrants sitting in Mexico waiting to cross and from Mexican‚Äôs waiting in California to become citizens. Not a single US citizen was interviewed, nor did they seem at all interested in that perspective. Reform  truly is hopeless.

        A slave revolt is a pretty good analogy and brings to mind the scene in History of the World Pt. 1  (It is said that the people are revolting! You said it, they stink on ice.https://youtu.be/h0iAcQVIokg). The simultaneous uttering of empty platitudes about the working class from the aristocracy juxtaposed with the utter revulsion they feel for us is the defining feature of the ruling class. What is more, many of them don‚Äôt even seem to realize it. The Bronx Bimbo Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was holding forth on twitter the other day declaring Republicans the party of big business and Democrats the party of the working man (er, person). She seems oblivious to the fact that big business is in bed with the Democrats and working class people voted for Trump. On the other hand she seems pretty oblivious in general.

            As an aside, your anecdote reminded me of an experience I had the other day. I was online later in the evening to apply for a tax ID number for a business and was told that the website was closed, and that it was only open during certain hours. The process is completely automated, I had the new tax ID in seconds when I applied during the hours it was open. Why would a website that is completely automated be closed for much of the week, unless there is a team of disgruntled Federal bureaucrats watching the website perform automated tasks.

Hours of OperationMonday to Friday, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
An hour or two I could see but this looks more like a schedule designed around having live staff.

                The retard level of American society has reached such an epic fever pitch that people actually think that this shit is justified ‚Äì and acceptable.The purpose of  a website ‚Äì is so that there is CONSTANT access, and your requests don‚Äôt have to be handled manually.Do not know for sure ‚Äì but I suspect that many of these websites simply act as another ‚Äúwindow‚Äù into the manual paperwork that is processed by all the useless government employees behind the scenes.  So when the employees aren‚Äôt present ‚Äì they ‚Äúshut down‚Äù the website so that when they get back to their desks they don‚Äôt have to do more than their union prescribed work load.I worked in tech in internet startups for a number of years back in the late 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs.  Bear in mind that the technology is MUCH better these days.  So when I see these kinds of things I think to myself :  ‚Äúthese people are just downright stupid ‚Äì or they‚Äôre making things hard on purpose ‚Äì but let‚Äôs start with stupid‚ÄùRemember back to when the health care connector websites were being created for Obamacare ‚Äì and it was costing 100‚Äôs of millions of dollars?What a farce.   There‚Äôs startup web companies that create things far more complicated than that crap on venture capital seed money only reaching in the (low) tens of millions.The way the government implements web technology is proof positive that they are completely and utterly incompetent ‚Äì and corrupt.

            Arthur, AOC may or may not be oblivious, but we now live in a culture where the grossest mischaracterizations and lies are put out there, and are repeated and cited despite their obvious and cited falsity.  It is the new way of things, where people are willingly duped into buying into a fantasy world of pain and suffering, all from the comfort of their easy chair.

                I visited the Imperial Capitol last October. My fiance and I went to the WWII memorial at night and were disappointed to see that several spotlights were out.
A few on the state fixtures and about half in one of the fountains‚Äîwhere the ones that did work varied a lot in color temperature (likely due to varying age).
I thought it was shameful. My old lady was pissed. I talked her out of going to tell the rangers in the nearby post. It didn‚Äôt seem likely to me that they‚Äôd head straight for the supply closet to rectify the issues.

        I think the author hits upon an important leg of government strategy here.  After working government and related beaurocratic jobs for many years, I have noticed they attempt to mire the productive employees in pointless paperwork and beauticratic red tape.  When inevitably you are delinquent in some of this, they put you ‚Äúon point,‚Äù and censure you harshly.  The purpose of course is that you cannot challenge their authority or administrative position based on incompetence because they are already complaining about you!  ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt done this paperwork mister!

                Ha! Same thing happened to me. Moved up to Water Distribution Operator in 2001. Was given a list of 150 tanks and 175 pumping plants, rate control valves, etc, a Thomas Bros. map book for the East Bay and Diablo Valley, a paper check-off list and told to start my rounds, with almost no training. So did what I could‚Ä¶.and within a week, two of the operators took me aside and quietly said, ‚ÄúWhat are you trying to do, make us look bad? Calm it down.‚Äù The ax man from Treatment was eventually brought in, and as nasty as he was, he revised the system and put the department aright doing real work.

                Had a consulting job with a municipality to roll out Windows 95 back in the mid 90‚Äôs.  The city IT department had been merged and reconfigured multiple times to the point that each employee was a member of 1 of 3 different unions.  Being naive, I asked that everyone get there 15 minutes early on the day of the roll out so we would be ready to go.  You would have thought I asked for them to turn over their first born for a sacrifice.  Amazingly they did show up and I made things better by bringing donuts.

        What I notice is the lack of forgiveness.  Revenge, eternal revenge, is the liberal starting point.
Revenge for things they make up.For cartoon characters like the Noble Savage.  For imagined sleights.  For potential sins.  For past mistakes, like getting it wrong with Bush‚Äôs Iraq.
No forgiveness.  Not for the past litany- slavery, Jim Crow, the Indians, the Crusades, the Fauxlocaust.Not for current white privilege or phobia.  Not for future fascism.
Even after we‚Äôre dead it will be our fault.  They‚Äôll look out on the dangerous ruins, on their diverse sharia, and cry, ‚Äúit was those damn Trumpist bastards!‚Äù

        Before Trump came down that escalator to announce his run for the presidency hardly anyone in our movement thought we‚Äôd be able to turn things around through our civic institutions.The optimism of his election and the rekindled sense that maybe we could turn things around has pretty much evaporated at this point.  We may get a victory here and there but we aren‚Äôt going to turn things around by being active citizens in the political process.Maybe it‚Äôs just the way I‚Äôm reading things and hearing things, but the dissident right seems to be almost back to where it was before Trump came down that escalator.If so, then replacing America requires a very different strategy than does reforming America.  I‚Äôm not saying we should give up, but at this point it‚Äôs probably not very wise to be putting all of our irons in the fire‚Ä¶

            The Declaration of Independence states that when the government gets to the point where it is working against us, then it is our right, even our duty to alter or abolish said government.  It is that ‚Äòalter or abolish‚Äô phrase that is interesting.  Attempting to vote the right people in or out, or trying to get our elected representatives to actually, you know, REPRESENT us is the ‚Äòalter‚Äô part of the equation.   But when government steadfastly and successfully resists all attempts at being altered by those being governed, then we have probably arrived at the ‚Äòabolish‚Äô part.   The only way that abolishing a government can be effected is violently, as in violent revolution.With Trump‚Äôs election I too hoped that we the people had one more shot at altering our government.  But now a stalemate has settled in, and Trump for whatever reasons is not willing to go scorched earth on the DOJ, FBI, DNC and the GOPe for their attempted coup d‚Äôetat.  So what next?  What, if anything at all, can we dirt people do at this stage that might still have any real prospects of altering our government back into something that represents our interests?  I wish I knew.An actual bloody revolution would be an order of magnitude more difficult and less likely to succeed than what our founders had to contend with.  Every communication we have and every movement we make is electronically vacuumed up in real time.  Our every association is logged, data-mined, and analysed.  License plate readers and our own cell phones record our movements, and the movements of anyone we associate with.  There is a digital army of Winston Smiths identifying not just firebrands and ringleaders, but anyone sympathetic to the ideas espoused by them.I remember the color revolutions that took place in the eastern European iron curtain countries in the 1990‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs.  These were largely peaceful revolutions, with hundreds of thousands of people marching in the streets.  The marches were not daily, but were at least weekly, sometimes twice or thrice weekly, for weeks and weeks, and even months.  They were ultimately successful in countries like Romania and Yugoslavia.  I have asked myself why nothing like that is happening here in America.And even if it could or did happen here, the deck is still very much stacked against us.  I remember the Tea Party march on Washington back during the first part of the Obama regime.  There were literally almost a million people there.  Photographs showed a vast sea of humanity on the Washington mall as large as if not larger than any gathering that had ever been held there.   And what was the outcome?  Nothing.  Why?  Because the government, aided and abetted by their American Pravda mainstream media, simply ignored it.  There was almost no media coverage.  What miniscule coverage there was characterized it as a gathering of just a few thousand.  So they simply disappeared the largest actual, physical protest gathering in US history.  They made it so that It Never Happened.  And they succeeded.How does a revolution counter such almost total control over what the average citizen is able to see?  Again, I wish I knew.  Even if we had weekly marches of a hundred thousand people in major cities ongoing for weeks or months, the permanent government along with its MSM propaganda arm has the ability to greatly minimize the appearance of such marches, or through disinformation characterize them as violent and evil.  Remember in 2016 how they painted the Trump rallies as violent, while never mentioning the gangs of leftist thugs stalking those rallies and doing violence to the peaceful attendees?  Such is the power of our government and its MSM preatorian guard to control the narrative.  They absolutely intend to resist any and all attempts on our part to peacefully and lawfully alter them.I wish I knew where we go from here.  As Claire Wolfe said, we are at that uncomfortable stage where it is too late to change anything and too soon to shoot the bastards.

                I suppose the revolution is not going to look like a revolution.  It will probably turn out to be a matter of terrorist cells popping up and striking wherever they can.  Car bombs, package bombs, poisoned letters ‚Äî just one of those can shut down the Imperial Capital for days; what would happen if they were happening every week?  I think this will not be a matter of hundreds of thousands marching on the Mall; it‚Äôs going to be like the decades-long IRA campaign.

            SNAP funds run out in February. Presumably some of the shortfall would be made up at the state level, and we might find out that a noticeable portion of recipients are overweight. Blacks are going to immediately accuse Trump of a ‚Äúgenocidal plot‚Äù, while accusing white rural Trump supporters of ‚Äúvoting against their own interests‚Äù.
Congress could selectively revive certain programs, and substantial lobbying will ensue to make that happen. The true beneficiary of SNAP is Big Ag and JPMorgan who holds the contract to run EBT.

                Weird thing this evening.  I needed to get something for dinner, arrived at my nearby Publix (grocery store) just before 6 PM, and lo and behold, waiting in line in front of the deli counter where the scrumptious, freshly-made fried chicken that Publix prepares, were nearly 10 very large A-A adults, both male and female.  I had never seen this before as I usually do my shopping in mid-day.  I guess the SNAP card works for fried chicken, too, as well as other government assistance programs.  There will be hell to pay if the cards get cut off IMO.  The store‚Äôs chain-link gates will come crashing down if this happens.  Lovely image I‚Äôm conjuring up.

        One of the anarcho-tyranny items is the hand held speeding cameras where the cops just stand on an overpass clicking away.  It‚Äôs not making anyone safer.  The Toledo cops laughed about how they caught a guy doing 130 mph on the camera.  They didn‚Äôt pull him over.  He merrily went on his way.  So, instead of a cop being visible and pulling over real speeders or catching criminals due to the speeding stop, you get a letter in the mail from the local revenue generator.

        This happened to me last year. I never gave my number to anyone except close confidantes, friends, and family. No one calls anymore anyway. They text or go through an app. The do not call list isn‚Äôt enforced. Never answer a call or text from a number that isn‚Äôt a contact on your phone. After 9 months of not answering and blocking calls, they finally stopped. Posters above are correct. Computers are auto generating the calls seeking to fish for answerers. Don‚Äôt answer!

        I‚Äôm not sure of the effectiveness of the strategy, but I figure that hang-ups and no answers are factored into their cost-benefit analysis and don‚Äôt really cost them much at all, because they require no human intervention. So, anytime I have the time, I at least let the call get to a human operator, because that ties up a resource. If I am particularly bored, I go along with whatever offer they‚Äôre making, giving them fake info, for as long as I can or have interest. The more you tie up actual human resources, the more expensive you make their scam for them.

            It costs them virtually nothing to make the call, and you only need to goon a couple of people to make it worthwhile. There‚Äôs not just direct scamming, if you get enough personal information you can farm that for a good long while as well for numerous purposes.
That being said it‚Äôs really only a device to prey on the legitimately mentally vulnerable.

                    I‚Äôve gotten a person. Once I got all the way to them requesting payment information to extend the warranty on some car I‚Äôve never owned! Kept them on the phone a good ten minutes, two or three different individuals.You have to give realistic sounding answers. One time I claimed that I owned a two-year-old high-end sports car that retails for something like half a million. I think it was a Ferrari or something ‚Äî picked it off DuckDuckGo.

                    Here in my So-Cal area code, all the people with money are Chinese.  The calls are to tell them the Chinese government is after them for sneaking money out of China, and to ask for money to call them off.  Since most of them are likely guilty of actually sneaking money out of China, and the Chinese government scares the bejeezus out of them, the hit rate for the scammers is probably a lot bigger than zero.

        To focus on the nonessential part of the column, see NOMOROBO.com for your phone SPAM problem. It works great on our landline. Since we are not of the generation who live by our cell phones, we give out our cell numbers rarely and have very little SPAM there. It‚Äôs free for landlines but there‚Äôs a fee for cells.

                They just auto-generate the numbers and start calling to see if anybody answers.  My cell phone number distribution is similar to yours ‚Äì and I‚Äôve watched how the calls come in.
There has been no connection between places I know I have given out the number to ‚Äì and spam calls that I have received.
Keeping the number private is no defense against robo-callers if they‚Äôre generating numbers and then calling.  You need a more in depth defense.

                    Yeah, the auto-dialer has been around for decades. Pols started using them in the early 1990‚Äôs. Today, the software is more sophisticated so the bad numbers are flagged. The robo-dialers then sell their lists to others. There‚Äôs a better than even chance the cell carriers are selling your data to these people too. AT&amp;T sells you location data in real time.

                I noticed decades ago that govt stopped trying to make life a little better in small but important ways. remember when ATMs came on the scene and we were told how much money it saved banks not having to pay for tellers? Then they started charging for the use of their modem to withdraw money for you from a different bank, Soon, it was $2.50 a transaction. Consumers screamed but the banks told us that ATMs were expensive to operate and stuff with cash.Govt promised to fix this but never did, of course.Potholes in your town? The homeless need that money. Traffic jams and rush hour? More freeways or lanes hurt the environment. Ride a bike.In Cal one agency spent over $100,000,000 to upgrade their computer software. Never worked. They could have gone to Amazon and said, who does your amazing software, and we‚Äôll hire them, but then there wasn‚Äôt enough graft in that.Need good roads? Let‚Äôs build a fast (slow) train to nowhere for 50 billion (and more).Govt is so dysfunctional in everything (including the military now) it isn‚Äôt funny. That‚Äôs partly why America is over and will have to either break up, or become overtly imperial in every sense.

            I have a Calls Blacklist app on my Android phone ‚Äì which I just add numbers to as they come in.  When I first got the thing a couple of  years ago (after being on a dumb phone for years) ‚Äì I was getting a lot of calls coming thru  ‚Äì despite being on the Do Not Call list.I got sick and tired of answering all those calls like ZMan is describing ‚Äì and for some reason my Android doesn‚Äôt have a built in blacklist ‚Äì so I had to install the app.After a few months of mercilessly adding any number that didn‚Äôt check out ‚Äì or did something that pissed me off‚Ä¶..   I found the number of ‚Äúspam‚Äù calls went down to almost nothing.The thing is this:  all of this robo-spamming crap is automated.  The just generated numbers to call ‚Äì and robo call until they get a response.  If they don‚Äôt get thru ‚Äì then the automation eventually starts reducing the times it tries to call you.  So blacklist their asses and the call volume should drop.

        I am old enough to remember when President Clinton‚Äôs Anti-Spam legislation was signed into law.  The effects of that much ballyhooed ‚Äúachievement,‚Äù and his intervention in the Netscape-Microsoft Affair ‚Äì the now infamous David Boies (also of Bush-v-Gore fame) representing The People, of course ‚Äì are just now coming back to bite us.Spam never went away, it just morphed into fake news and pop-ups.  The Browser Wars of the 90‚Äôs were lost to Google, with, 2019, no appreciable competition insight.

        I had the same thing start in December, I was getting 4 or 5 calls a day to sign up for health insurance.  They were spoofing local phone numbers which is illegal.  They left a voicemail every time they called.  Even legitimate businesses are doing this, Sirius XM called me from a spoof number last week, I chewed the caller out and asked to be placed on their do not call list.  They said they would do that, we will see if the calls stop.Here is an article from last summer about the FCC shutting down one scammer.  Gizmodo estimates there were 3.4 billion robocalls during April 2018.https://gizmodo.com/fcc-hits-robocaller-with-120-million-fine-but-the-call-1825941926

        I was getting lots of span calls on my cell phone long before this government shutdown started. Clearly the ‚Äúdo not call‚Äù registry has not been working for quite some time. Like yourselves, I no longer answer my phone when it rings unless I recognize the source number. If not, and they do not leave a message, I assume it is a spammer.

        My proposal to end spam calls is requiring every caller to pay a nominal fee to every person they are calling ‚Äì $.25 or $.50,  something like that.
It would be easy to keep track of with modern billing,  would matter much at all to regular phone users.  But would bankrupt boiler room operations.

I knew you could speak English‚Äô and promptly hung up.On the plus side most cells have a block feature so you can block spammers.  Which leads to this question:  how long before we reach critical mass on blocked email addys and/or cell numbers before the entire systems seizes and stops working?

        At the end of the don‚Äôt hang up calls, there is an opportunity to opt out and then they do not call you anymore. That worked for me.

            Huh.  I might try that.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hang up‚Äù gets me to hang-up every time.
* I actually received a ‚Äúdo not hang up call‚Äù while typing this.  I pressed ‚Äú9‚Äù to no longer receive information on a medical brace they think I need for some reason.

                You should call the Medicare or your insurance fraud line about this.  There have been a number of people who have had these ‚Äúmedical supply‚Äù companies who are fraudulently billing Medicare for these devices in the name of people who have never received them, nor need them, nor even asked for them!

            The opt-out never works.  Just to test, I opted out of the same call every day for a week.  Now I go through to get a person and then either let it sit quietly or blast music.

                Never answer.  They list by whether the number responds, i.e. if you answer the phone.
Even after a serious company data breach, I still only get the two odd calls per day.  My uncle at the phone company told me to simply ignore them.  Had about 6 per day before that, from giving a solar saleswoman my info at Home Depot.
Some hostile has doxxed Zman on a private journo-list.

        We have the government we elected.  True, you may not have voted for Lincoln, or TR, or FDR, or LBJ, or RMN, or JC, or WJC, or either King George, or BHSO, but your fellow Americans (and some illegals) sure did.  These are the villains who represent what our elected representatives and these villains built (with help from the Philosopher Kings and Queens of SCOTUS).  How did they do it?  The American people elected them to office and allowed them to do it.  WE HAVE THE GOVT WE MADE, and that govt gave us the managerial state from which we suffer.You‚Äôll never restore the US to what it was in, say 1796.  All you can do if you want something like that back is take down the twisted, perverted Leviathan that is and REPLACE it with a limited govt under the control of a much stronger Constitution and much weaker central government (hmmmm. . . .  something like the Articles?).
