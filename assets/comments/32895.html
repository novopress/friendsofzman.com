        David Deutsch, the quantum computer scientist, has his own definition of reality, similar to Phillip Dick’s, but I prefer his. “Reality is anything that kicks back.”I live in a somewhat white lower middle-class suburb, adjacent to a wealthier white suburb. Drive through my neighborhood and you’ll see mostly Trump signs, some colorful, featuring Trump holding up his fist after getting shot, etc. Then a handful of Harris signs, usually staked in organic garden patches or adjacent to Ukraine flag displays.Go to the rich white neighborhood and it’s three to one Harris to Trump, and there are a lot of ridiculous signs. “Grab Him by the Ballot!” etc. Driving around there, I couldn’t help but think of that Deutsch quote, and that, “These are people who haven’t been kicked in a while.” They go to work, come home, watch MSNBC. The last twenty or thirty years haven’t happened to them. If they were just entering the workforce, they would see how antiwhite it is, and experiencing the humiliation of current HR dogma would sicken and probably terrify them. But again, no kicking…A lot of them are probably going to die of old age before they get kicked, but their children and grandchildren are going to get stomped. It won’t just be kicking, but the boot that Orwell talked about, since it’s natural for people who don’t know how to fight invite further violence once they don’t respond to the initial assault. There are a lot of completely deinstinctualized, deracinated whites out there.It’s impossible, futile for me to try to explain anything to them or their parents. I frankly hate them, the old progressive whites, much more than I could ever hate anyone else.Even the “conservatives” voting for Trump don’t understand how bad it’s going to get. They’ve never lived in anything but a white majority neighborhood in a majority white country. That’s something both the whites in my working class neighborhood and the whites in the adjacent booshie boomer neighborhood don’t realize. Ideology is a luxury, an artefact. The tool they’re relying on is completely useless to address the current problem.We’re entering the ”headcount” era of politics. All those Blacks For Trump (and most of those Hispanics) that you see online are going to disappear on November Fifth. Asians (North and Subcontinent) follow authority and power and will split mostly for Harris. South Asians will go mostly for Harris because they are mostly poor and dumb.Trump may win, and he may slow the decay. I frankly hope he does, but our main problem remains, as you put it, the 20 percent of whites who simply cannot deal with reality. Think of that white guy who got on TV after his son was killed by a Haitian who said he wished his son had been killed by a sixty year-old white man. How in God’s name do you fix that? House slaves in the antebellum era who called their masters “boss” didn’t have their brains that scrambled, their loyalties that crossed.

            Well said. It is likely that those out-of-reality whites either are running the HR team doing the kicking or managing teams or divisions and gleefully doing the kicking.
Whites have been getting curbstomped since the 50s. It’s just that it was far away. As you say, our children and grandchildren are going to live a terrible reality because they refused to see that far into the future, and chose status and comfort today over their duty to their ancestors and their posterity.

            You don’t “fix that”. There’s no fixing it.Then again, the Haitian eliminated the genetic line of that asshat by killing his son. So maybe that’s how it’s fixed.Survival of the fittest and such.One commenter today was talking about not being able to predict the future. I’ll take a stab at it, and repeat what has been discussed here many times. For Whites to survive long term, they’re going to have to go Roman on their enemies,(there’s quite a bit to choose from). Then small areas of like minded people will have to coalesce, and forge themselves a life, albeit one without the luxuries currently available.Things will sort themselves out, one way or another. I’ve had a good life. My only despair for the future is my children, and the privation and hardship they will have to deal with, that I didn’t.

I just want to note that I strongly suspect that whole put-on was fake.  Just picture this scenario as a possibility: you’re the dad, and the TV comes on proclaiming that some oddly dressed guy is *you* and the guy is spouting nothing but regime propaganda.

                    I’ve heard the regime operates a “unit” that scouts which white parents of children murdered by wogs are willing to say the approved words, and which ones aren’t. Which puts the former on tv and keeps the latter off.

                “Then again, the Haitian eliminated the genetic line of that asshat by killing his son. So maybe that’s how it’s fixed.”It’s harsh, but it’s also truth. Mother Gaia punishes civilizational stupidity with civilizational death. I could say that the young man’s death is just natural selection in action, but it wouldn’t strictly be true. It was artificial selection.Civilizations are ecosystems, not ‘are like’, but ‘are’. We Europeans are optimized for success in one kind of ecosystem/civilization. Our ancestors allowed enemies into our ecosystem who proceeded to modulate it so that it was better for them and worse for us. We are like little minnows happily swimming up and down a stream nibbling on vegetation. Then beavers come and build a dam and all of a sudden the good times come to an end. The beavers must be expelled from the stream and the dam dismantled.That young man’s father was broken as the result of a century-long cultural re-engineering campaign by internationalists targeting European people. Father Feeney, 1957 “Having a television in your home is like having a Jew in your living room.” -&gt; not a criticism of televisions per se, but acknowledgment of who was controlling the programming that appeared on it

                        A critical point to understand is that our administrative class (formerly but no longer a ruling class) inclusive of “episcopalians with their lgbtqai+ etc,etc flags” has been not only just as socially engineered as the peasantry, but even more so, and first. The old WASP ruling class had many, many failings, but they were never genocidal towards Europeanity nor were they open borders lunatics during the period when they actually ruled (pre-1960’s).The Ivy’s have been the training grounds for those who rule over us since our beginning. They were the first to be taken over. The rot spread from the Ivy’s to the rest of academia (aping their perceived betters) and using their graduates with the cognitive stamps of the new civilizational pattern as managers in both public and private sector (especially media and education) to shape those of us in the great unwashed masses.It’s one of the great failings of our people not to see that other peoples plan and execute multi-generational projects. It’s not just other ‘smart’ peoples like Jews. Mexicans, for example, are not renowned for their cognitive prowess, but they are going to inherit the southwest of former America when the Empire inevitably fractures. (We better hope we can stop them at just the southwest. Gonna require some rollback.) Does anyone think that they don’t know what they are doing? Sure, the peasantry isn’t ‘read in’ but their elites on both sides of the border know what they are doing. Our ruling class past and present has been and is too busy guzzling money to engage in pedestrian activity like proper imperial management.This is in essence what Pres. Trump is attempting to sell himself as to the Jews who he is attempting to gather into his merchant coalition: a repairman of empire who can shore up their wealth and rent-seeking activity in exchange (hopefully) for a cessation in genocidal anti-white replacement

            Isn’t it ironic that your typical shitlib would assume I hate negros, or mestizos? I’m pretty sure I’ve never hated a wog, individually or collectively. What would be the point? No, my hate is reserved for shitlib whites/ashkenazis. Without whom we would have very few problems with wogs, or much of anything else that I can see, really.

                There are other factions out there than liberals and conservatives. I, for example, do not consider myself left wing OR right wing. I favor violence specifically and The Arts, such as literature, in general. I want the freedom to do what I want without ethical constraints. I want to see great examples of Art, living in front of me, in three-dimensional glory. That is the kind of thing that makes my day.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            All true, and certainly depressing, but the road to redemption is not one of mass persuasion or awakening. You are you and you control you. And you can make a tangible difference. In all higher order lifeforms, nature has evolved antibodies to fight systemic disease. At the nuts &amp; bolts level, one antibody removes one pathogen. The Elites want the antibodies to attack each other. Your imperative is to resist this urge and do the natural thing.

                Correct.  I define “scrambled eggs” for brains as a set that includes “true believers” *and* folks who are “clueless”.  Clueless are the “useful idiots” Lenin is said to have spoken about.  My estimate, from typical electoral process review, is that we have at the very least 50-66% in the scrambled eggs for brains category—and we’ve not even delved into the aspect of IQ deterioration within the populace as a confounding effect.

            I am of the age you describe.  It is indeed very disheartening that many of my generation are blind to what is happening.   They are hostile in some cases when you try to explain the facts of life to them.   I am old too but come on boomers.   You have to maintain some sense of reality.  It’s not the eighties anymore.   Can’t you see what is happening to your children?
A lot of them are just intellectual zombies.  I guess it is just easier for them to ignore the situation.

                This is the main gripe I have with the boomers.  Their stubborn refusal to understand/acknowledge that things have changed.  You’re right, there are some that show extreme hostility to any criticism of the system, as though you’re insulting them personally.  It’s remarkable, they think all their ‘success’ was a result of their brilliance, cunning and work ethic and not the fact that they grew up as the main beneficiaries of the post-WWII prosperity bubble.  It seems their enormous egos can’t handle a slight nudge, let alone a kick by reality.

                    This.  I’ve mentioned such with comment on the exemplar, Kamala Harris.  Stupid people often fall in love with big words and catchy phrases—of which they have little depth of understanding, but happily repeat over and over again thinking it makes them sound “smart” when in fact it is a tell of their stupidity.
So it is with usNthem’s example and Harris’ typical word salad interviews.

            The last 60 years or so have seen something unprecedented in the world and that is the creation of a new Western and especially American “Television Man” (Homo vidiensis?). These are people, mostly Whites**, who are essentially raised by the TV (and now the internet and social media). I believe these people have an essentially novel personality type and can only really be compared to people raised in extreme religious cults in the past. The reason is that mass media automates the brainwashing process. Prior to the media age, cults had to spend hours a day indoctrinating young people. Today, the whole thing is automatic and lazy parents aid and abet the process by letting them be raised by media.There is thus probably a hard core 20-30% of Whites, many now middle aged, who simply cannot ever be deprogrammed from race-cuckery. We will need to be able to identify these people and exclude them if we are not to waste resources trying to “save” them. There’s probably also a genetic component. Many of us have noted the oddly predictive power of “the phys”. I’ve noted that, at least for men, I can usually see shitlibbery in their faces. There’s way too much anecdotal evidence for the neckbeard and soyface stereotypes for them to be merely humorous constructs.** Mostly Whites: The various PoCs tend to let their children roam the neighborhood rather than stay indoors all the time. You can verify this anytime you want by visiting a black or Hispanic area.

            Derbyshire notes that White people are p*ssies. He is of course correct. Whites have just laid back since the 1950s at least just taking it. Because we are indeed p*ssies.But its important to understand why. Whites are individualized and atomized. We don’t have the large families that lasted until the 1940s. We are dispersed to the suburbs. We don’t have like Somalis, Haitians, Indians, Sikhs, Salvadorans, and Pakistanis twenty cousins and 35 second cousins on call to threaten the agents of the state on our behalf when mistreated. We are all alone, as individuals, in the face of the Fury of the Wokethems.This is why Kabab Muslim on the street does not get canceled. He’s got all that manpower able and willing to break things on his behalf, and he in his turn will break things. Because they are all related, in an extended family.Who will fight for you? Some stranger White guy? Why would he?This is why fantasies of some sort of White redoubt are just that, fantasies. The only proven weapon against the State is the family, and an extended, non-nuclear family at that. Only that type of family provides enough manpower and then clan power to fight off the State.[Trump is probably toast. If he wins Judge Merchan will immediately put him in Rikers, no appeal and cameras turned off. Then Biden will cancel the election and just rule indefinitely.]

        Progressivism isn’t a mystery.  Examine the statistics from the past century: Progressivism is the socio-political expression of ever-increasing collective female power.  It isn’t just that, but it is mostly that.Who dominates your institutions?  Blacks?  No.  Jews?  Nupe.  Women run your institutions and call all the shots.  Pretending the problem is Something Else is, well, conservatism.‘As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them’.  (Isaiah 3:12)That was written almost 3 thousand years ago.  Ain’t nothing changed.  The problem has only gotten worse, to the point where what Isaiah wrote now is destroying your nations, and Western civilization to boot.

                Not sure why you were downvoted. I think a faction of American “elites” made a deal with them decades ago, who knows what kissinger was telling them when he and Nixon “opened” China. But if i were the chinese and i didn’t want to fight a direct war, i’d say everything that is going on in our society i’d be promoting. I’d make sure the people who believe in nothing rose to positions of power and created as much choas and confusion as possible while i made my move for dominance. Maybe they downvoted you because they haven’t check under their bed for jews yet today 😉https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_campaign_finance_controversy

            I often wonder if those cultures, such as Islam, that seem so horribly misogynist do not really represent an extreme counter reaction to some long destroyed ancient gynocracy. Anthropologists and historians will often object that the historical evidence for this is lacking (except for the ones trying to create revisionist tales of feminist utopias). Perhaps the terrifying truth is that female-headed societies run themselves into the ground so hard they destroy all traces of themselves other than the violent backlash that follows. There are passages of the Old Testament such as the one you cite that hint at this as well, not to mention the whole Genesis account.

                No, it’s that archeologists expect to find techno-artifacts that simply didn’t exist during the ‘mother right’ cultures of extreme antiquity.  They thereupon conclude that gynocratic language-groups and cultures did not exist.  Silly extrapolation.  Read J.J. Bachofen and James Frazer, and you’ll understand the reality of antiquity.What didn’t exist was neolithic technology. . . so there’s little or nothing for the proud archaeologists to find, aside from scattered ‘Venus’ figurines.  Those cultures didn’t care about, or produce, the artifacts that the archeos expect.But the gyno-cultures — as Catal Huyuk demonstrate — certainly did exist.  This background is why modern Western men are so cucked and helpless in the face of their totalitarian feminist societies.  They have been pre-conditioned since the matri-focal old days, and they cannot break free to see the truth.  It’s just too scary for them.  They prefer to wallow in the comfort of lies.

                    It wouldn’t surprise me if these gyno-cultures lacked technology since men drive innovation in that area. In those stone age groups that survived into the 20th century you often see a pattern of the women doing primitive farming while the men are sidelined and sit around drunk on palm wine and go on the occasional hunt. That’s probably an easy pattern for a society to fall into and stagnate there for millennia. You see a modernized version of this in the ghetto with the men doing and selling drugs and the women “farming” the welfare system.I’m sure the elites think they can force formerly productive White men into this kind of idleness and criminality. In upper middle class groups the gamer-bros with their culture of weed and video games are probably the White version of ghetto culture. Perhaps most young White men will be content with this but I think eventually there will be some sort of explosion. Black men have so far tended to direct their violent frustrations at each other but White guys are more likely to correctly identify the gynocracy as the real problem. I’ve seen speculation that this is perhaps how civilization itself got started and overthrew the matriarchy.I’ll check outJ.J. Bachofen and James Frazer.

No one in 1850 could predict the world of 1950.  Marxism pushed science-y sounding theories of late-stage this and early-stage that which is just made up gobbledygook.  None of the Marxist predictions came true.  Anyone who tells you they know what the world will be like in 2070 is blowing smoke.

            And as Spengler and others have pretty convincingly shown, cultures and civilizations are cyclical.  I can excuse the Victorians for having some limited faith in progress, because they had cleaned up a lot of social problems that had gotten out of control.  But the smarter ones knew that hubris was a problem, and that all humans were very fallible.

                Spengler had some ideas I’m not too sure about. I know he’s popular.with some dissidents on the right, but he seemed to pretty much deny biology. I don’t think history makes any sense if you don’t put human biology and genetics at the center of it.  Race isn’t that important to him? It seems to me that he’s yet another person predicting that he knows what the future is going to be and that we’re in a decline phase.  Granted, we’re importing the third world so we’re declining! I am skeptical of any borderline mystical Force that somehow externally enforces cycles on the world. He believes in some kind of racial mysticism but not the actual science of race? Because he was a big critic of a certain regime in Germany in the 1930s.

                    Spengler wasn’t right about everything,  but I think he was pretty close about the grand sweep of history.  As you suggested, he was influenced by the fraudulent anthropology of Boas, which hadn’t yet been as discredited then, as with the information we know now.
And I’m a big critic too of that certain 1930s regime.  It didn’t end up doing a lot of good ultimately for Germans, Slaves, or whites in general.  Hitler might have been right about some things, but he made clear his contempt for Germans towards the end of the war.

        Colorblind civic nationalism is a hothouse flower. People could pretend that it would grow in the wild as long as the West was 80-90% white. As whites fall as a percent of the population, colorblind civic nationalism – Western conservatism – will fall with it.
You already see it happening, and its fall will only accelerate. Rufo thinks and acts like a child. As whites become a minority, it will be time to put away childish things.

                Actually, I was wrong. Colorblind civic nationalism isn’t dying; it’s dead. Look at who really runs the country. It’s not colorblind civic nationalists. It’s an ethnic minority that is hyper-aware of race and religion and works as a team to promote its people and agendas that it believes help that people.American conservatism isn’t dying; it’s already dead. And we know what replaced it: Tribalism and, when possible, ethnic nationalism. Ethnic nationalism isn’t possible in the US for the current minority in charge so it uses tribalism within a multi-everything society, but that same minority promotes ethnic nationalism in a part of the world where it can be achieved.

        This week has given us a great example of one of modern conservatism’s bigest achilles heels.  In the wake of Barry O’s “the brothers ain’t lining up behind Kamala!” gaffe, Con Inc. has tripped over itself to highlight blacks who are outraged by this and will now vote for Trump.Blech!  Approximately 90% of them are still going to vote for Harris.  And more importantly, they’re not our people.  But the conservatives tuck themselves in at night fearful that somewhere, some negro or leftist is accusing them of racism.With all that attention devoted to solving a patently intractable problem, conservatives have nothing useful left to offer.

            If only 90% of them vote D that’s a big problem for the Ds. Usually it’s higher. I think last time out it was 94 or something like that. Probably will be this time too. It’s that elusive dream of getting it down to 90 or dare they hope for 88, that keeps the Rs pushing for the negro vote. It looks so attainable, just a couple more points!

                    Unlike the Left — which includes true believers, fanatics, and ideologues — Conservatism and the GOP are essentially a racket.  The conservative agenda = whatever keeps the shekels flowing, which in practice means maintaining the status-quo, catering to donors, and stringing along the suckers (i.e. Republican voters).The gulf between the evil cynics who run Con, Inc and the hapless Fox News viewer is vast.  The Cheneys and other principled cons endorse Harris because who cares about trans kids and endless Haitians so long as the Deep State and MIC keep humming along? That’s conservatism in a nutshell.How would a Nikki Haley administration differ from a Harris administration?  Apart from having a worse foreign policy…

                        Something of a tangent but I really have to hand it to Cheney and GWB for so consistently being on the wrong side of everything. This is especially true on the blow-up-the-world issue. Wherever they see a fire raging in the world, from the Middle East to Europe or Asia, they fly there on their supersonic magic carpets loaded with barrels of gasoline. Cheney in particular, has earned a throne of honor in Hell.

            Yes, when faced with the possibility that there are black guys “off the plantation” as they like to say, they just can’t help themselves. They fawn over these guys and ignore their own, as we saw at the RNC. The cons run elections to pander to Jews, blacks, and Hispanics, in that order, and take our votes for granted. Well, it’s time to stop giving it to them unconditionally.And as you point out, what are the odds that these guys actually do vote for Trump? I know that black guys have long had an affinity for Trump, but according to the exit poll data, he got something like 13% of the black guy vote… in 2016. Even less in 2020. But, then again, I am starting to come around to a theory I heard, that most black votes are ballot harvested in the big cities.

        “Conservativism in America was just slow progressivism,…”Yep, but this insight is nothing new.  The question is, *why*?I’ve thought about this in and off—between my relapses into traditional conservative thought.  Let me see if I can explain my current thinking through some examples.If “conservatism” can be broadly defined as trying to maintain age old values, which we believe to be timeless as well as beneficial, what (conservative) societies/groupings can we point to as exemplars of the concept.  I immediately look to groups like the Amish or the Hasidic “tribe”.  Obviously there are other examples here and around the world, but these two will do.The Amish *and* the Hasidic boil off their malcontents—that is to say, their progressives.  They reject and shun them.  Meanwhile, they self identify and remain isolated from the outside world through dress, mannerism, and extreme ethnocentrism.  They have mastered “being in the world, but not of it”. Of course, they had great help from the surrounding society over centuries of isolation, if not outright repression/ostracism.I think there is a lesson here for us.  We can’t have it both ways.  We’ve tried winning over (converting) the increasing proportion of malcontents (progressives) for going on a century now.  It seems, for White DR’s anyway, only a well defined *homeland*—from where the inevitable malcontents (spiteful mutants and non-Whites?) can be expelled—is the answer.  Otherwise, we are doomed to extinction as ideas, no matter how correct,  will not prevail over biology.How to obtain such is the question.

ive thought about the Amish a lot too. But they are only allowed to live in such a  privileged way because of the protection of the empire. They die off without the empire. So applying Amish writ large is not possible because they only exist because of the empire.
race mixing is evil plain and simple. At least pretending race doesn’t exist and “organizing” a society around that. While Ramz Paul may think whites can live with Clarence Thomas we are just back to 1964 again

This is not what I was getting at, more toward an example of “driving off” of their malcontents to remain intact.  A homeland is what we need, even if within the present continent.  This country then expels such malcontents, or at the very least keeps them repressed and powerless.  Nothing like that can be done today, hence out “conservative” movement continues to deteriorate through (forced) inclusion of these malcontents.

            The problem with conservatism is built right into it.  It attracts people who want to preserve the status quo.  It doesn’t really matter what the status quo happens to be.  The Soviets had their conservatives after a while.Think of it in terms of “I just want to be left alone to grill in my backyard”  They do not have a positive vision for the future.  They just want the present.  When things change, in a few years they have adjusted to it and want to preserve the new status quo.  This is why conservatism usually fails to bring in young people.  They have not fully adjusted to the status quo.  Of course, it does not help their cause that progressives fill the youth’s soft heads with dreams of what ‘could be un-burdened by what was.’In another 20 years, all the woke stuff of today will be traditional conservative values.This is why conservatives are at all times and places completely useless.

A clue can be found in Rush Limbaugh.  He tried to embrace both traditional values and capitalism-as-the-highest-value.
Traditional values are rooted in the history of a people and often impede the efficiency of commerce.  Capitalism-as-the-highest-value dissolves tradition like an acid.

            Conservatives are just slow-on-the-uptake left-wingers. Left-wingers look down on conservatives as backward, and they’re right, because conservatives have consistently the same direction of travel as the left, just more slowly.  What proportion of the western population are genuinely right wingers, not just slow-on-the-uptake left-wingers? 10% of men? 5% of the overall population?

        The world that you said where we are headed we entered into a long time ago. The leaders in the 20s I think understood that we were a multi-ethnic society but more or less a tri-racial society. They were correct in shutting the border and stopping the immigration that had moved from solely Northern European into including Southern and Eastern European. Now, the third race was by virtue of that group seeing themselves as their own civilization that was more ancient and better than all other civilizations by virtue of their chauvanistic and ethno-centric/supremacist covenant with their God.However, between the WWII imperialists and the POS Ellis Island race’s ascendancy into the heights of financial and political power and influence that project was scuttled with Hart/Cellar. Had the 20s moratorium and the attendant and until then successfully implemented project of assimilation of the European race into a new a singlely identified ethnos gone on for a solid century America would still be. Not only would it still be, we would already be mining comets, sending robotic machines to mine our solar system for resources and have built a civilization that finally far surpassed Rome in glory.That is not to be. As of 1965, we became a multi-ethnic and multi-racial society. We were no longer a Western/Anglo-Saxon rights based heirarchical order. We were pretending to be but we weren’t. “Conservatism”, was all about pretending to be in the interests of the Cold War Imperialism of proving to the Third World that we were better and more open egalitarians than the Soviet version of egalitarianism.What is happening now is that the lid has blown off of the pot of the multi-racial/ethnic society. The former majority is deracinated and cowed. So the emergent racial groups are allying to push them over the cliff. At the top is an oligarchy that has too many eye-raising contradictions to contain.At once they hate the nation state and are demolishing it, yet forcing even the most anti-state of the oligarchs to go and stare at memorials under the watch of priests and foreign agents posing as journalists. They all scramble to be the most ardent supporter of funding and arming the one nation state that must be allowed to fight tooth and nail for ethnic cleansing and territorial expansion. Yet, legally and illegally our border is dissolved.You have a longstanding racial spoils system that is now unmasked as a racial caste system that is putting the former majority at the bottom and setting them up for total dispossession, second class “citizenship”, and rhetorically setting the stage for their mass genocide.I frankly think none of us should care about the other groups. Our concern should be the future for ourselves and our children and grand children. Our job is not to wait for saviors, but to be your and Our own savior in the sane and prudent way that the Fates provide for you to be. Embrace that fate. Embrace and lose your shame. Be unashamed to be determined that Our race and ethnic group will be the one that has sovereignty and self determination in Our homeland and that someday our posterity will reclaim it all. No doubt some of you will be or your posterity will be some of the ones who will speak publicly with courage and conviction and assertively on behalf of Our Nation and lead us to self determination. The path will go through an attempt to keep the lid on through massive tyrannical repression.I don’t think that is going to work as too many genies have been loosed from the lamp. We are going to have to go through that attempt. We are going to have to hold the moral high ground while not yielding and forfeiting our identity and thus our future. On the contrary, through it we must forge our positive identity and act in ways that bolster and affirm it.We are in the crucible now. Our ancestors serve as great examples. We too must now take our place as the ones in our 8000+ year lineage who had their backs to the wall and forged themselves in Fate’s crucible as Iron!Have a great weekend everyone!

                It is good that others are making this point. It is a fairly obvious one and one that we should get on the tips of many tongues to strengthen our moral and physical claims.I think Rousseau writes outstanding speeches and delivers them with fire. He is a great orator. I think that Our people need to try tons of different approaches and I don’t have a criticism or problem with PF. I think their optics are great and that they stay away from European 30s and 40s cinema. That is very wise.As far as I know, he is an outstanding talent and he is playing a very important role and stands as a good example of the type of leadership I describe.

            Your post induced a vision of the future in me:
An army of non-whites, led by white mercenaries, funded by the chosen and puritans, has put down the last rebellion, led by Reagan republicans, in Boise.
The leaders of the army are announcing their victory to the country. A stupid black man is speaking and ignores the pronouns of one of the white funders. The white funder interrupts the black to correct him about proper pronoun usage and the black shoots him dead on the spot.
Suddenly, the puritan whites realize where they really stand in the new order.

        Excellent podcast!Yes, the Progressive Project is dying if not already dead. It seems the opposite due to madness such as compelled transgenderism, which is just a Hail Mary to keep the project alive. It was simultaneously telling and hilarious when Fox hired cross-dressed Bruce Jenner to prove who the real transphobes are. We are on the cusp of pure tribalism due to Progressivism’s even more insane project, demographic change. You even can argue, and sort of did, that National Populism or Trumpism is the actual last gasp of the Progressive Project before it yields to the inevitable racial head count demographic change yields. The racial and ethnic sorting will accelerate even as busses drop off Haitians in Appalachia.Again, well done.

            Progressivism is succeeding beyond its wildest dreams. Soon, the they/thems will have their ultimate dream: the Uighur Solution to the White People Problem.BigCorp has been addicted to high IQ Chinese slave labor since the 1990s. Now that Xi is forcing them out, in favor of his own controlled State Owned Enterprises, which is the Chinese Way, they are in a quandry.There is no shortage of low IQ labor, see the importation of Haitians into small towns with meat packing or food processing factories. That can rinse and repeat forever to keep wages of Americans down, with Americans subsidizing their own replacements and even worse abuses in Mexico, Cambodia, Indonesia etc.. Some military forces can do the math and understand this is the Karen Carpenter Diet Plan for them — social spending on immigrants and descendants crowding out ALL military spending.But BigCorp dreams of camps for White people, where per the Dead Kennedys we will work harder with a gun in our back, for a bowl or rice a day. Pol Pot indeed. That is the other reason for all the military age third worlders.

        As the Z-Man rightly points out, the reason Conservatism always “loses” is that they are in fact liberals who just protest a bit before accepting the liberal changes.The reason this is so is because the foundational basis of Conservatism is exactly the same as that of Liberalism: Individualism.All of the things that supposed Conservatives oppose are based on individual rights.Whether it be civil rights or transexual rights all of the arguments go back to a moral analysis that fundamentally says that individuals own their own bodies and minds and therefore should have maximum freedom in respect to those so long as that freedom does not infringe on the rights of another person. This also is foundational to Libertariansim.How can a Conservative make an honest argument against civil Rights or transexual rights as an individualist.He can’t.This is why the “right wing” for lack of a better term needs a revolution in thought.That revolution is the acceptance of “socialism”. Here I am defining socialism not in economic terms but as a philosophical starting point of moral reasoning.As a socialist in this sense I accept both the existance and the rights of a “group”, or more pertenantly an ethnic group.With this foundation you have the ability not to argue for individual rights but to chart the course of your group.This is a solid foundation for nationalism and traditional values. With this foundation you can argue against the civil rights of minorities and sexual/social deviants.With this foundation you can argue for laws against so called “victimless crimes” such as pornography and drug use.Visualize this type of socialism as a bundle of sticks which are easily snapped one by one but which when held together can not be snapped even by a strong man.

            Collectivist instead of socialist would helpfully disambiguate.
At any rate, however, what is the New Left’s identity politics if not collectivist? These people envisage a war of group on group, principally non-whites warring on whites. Not much sympathy for individualism among that lot. Just look at the opproprium heaped upon cats like Clarence Thomas and Kanye West.

                Most whites tend towards individualism, but so long as we live in a world of tribes, this individualism is a weakness.
My synthesis of these problems is that whites should aim for individualism within homogeneous nations. We must match the tribalism of the outer world, but hopefully within our nations, we can allow our individual freak flags to fly, insofar as they don’t damage our outward tribal stance.
Finally, do we really want to allow the creative destruction of laisse-faire capitalism to raze some of our communities just so that we save a few dollars on consumer goods?

        Regarding you discussion of why did slavery begin to fall out of favor in the early 19th century, I asked myself “what other things did this correlate to at the time?” What I came up with is industrialization and the movement of populations from the agricultural areas to the cities. Industrialization began in Britain and later expanded to other nations like the North of the United States. Cities and slavery are not a neat match. As I recall, even the ancient Romans pointed out how slavery in Rome (mostly made up of people from conquered places of the empire) negatively impacted the ability of free Romans to earn a living. So, it seems to be that economics allowed — even required — the abandonment of slavery. Naturally, we all want to be seen as the good guys in any narrative, so we made a virtue out of necessity … and the abolitionist movement of progressivism flourished. I mean, could you imagine putting up a slave or two in your  urban or suburban home even if you liked the idea of slavery? Sure, the very wealthy might be able to afford it, but it’s far easier (not to mention safer) to hire someone at a living wage from the next neighborhood over than risk rioters burning down your factory and home.

            “Slavery was never abolished, it was only extended to include all the colors.”  -BukowskiSoutherner Hinton Helper understood that slavery was not worth defending in the South because it existed to depress the wages for common white folk.

            Interesting point.
One could also argue that economics birthed feminism. With inflation and the regression of real wages in the early 70s there was a crying need for two incomes. Voila, suddenly encouraging young Heather to go into the workforce and become a girrrlboss doesn’t look so awful. “Liberation” was nothing but a moral fig leaf.
Not saying I necessarily espouse this argument. Just shooting from the hip, really.

                    The poison of Feminism (my take) was not in filling in for a “boring life”, but in telling women that their life—as in God, Children, Church—was second rate. What followed of course is that “new” women were imbued with “you go girl” admonishments and pushed toward the workplace outside of the home as *the* source of meaning and accomplishment. The result was that the (traditional) family structure was undermined.This is not all the fault of Feminism and women in general.  I fault the men as much, if not more.  Men found it irresistible to have a second source of income from their spouse—even at the expense of hearth and home.  We are so many generations into such, that we’ve forgotten there was ever a time of the (predominant) one income family.  We’ve become accustomed to live above our means and our children now pay the price.  I’ve seen personally families where one income is sufficient only to see the wife continue to prioritize work and pay for someone else to raise their children.Been there done that, so no saint either, but upon reflection now see where this societal change inevitably leads.

            In the 1830s prior to the Nat Turner slave revolt, the steel makers and locomotive manufacturers in Virginia wanted to abolish slavery. They had a need for 24/7 operations, including at night obviously, with literate workers who could follow written instructions. They neither wanted nor had the capacity to provide housing and care for slaves, much less manage them — they had their hands full with their primitive but profitable factories.Hence the desire to free the slaves to get a more useful and productive workforce. That came to a halt with the Turner slave revolt, but there it was. Absent that, slavery would have been abolished in Virginia, which would have remained in the Union, Lee would have led the Union Army to crush the Secessionists, and no one would have heard of Grant or Sherman as the war would have been over in a year with an Industrialized Virginia.Which is a shame as America depended on the tension and impasse between Utopian New England and hierarchical / warrior Virginia.

            I wouldn’t be quite so certain.  What good is lots of money if your world, your people, and your civilization are destroyed?  When I imagine getting 3 unlimited wishes, my first one – in all honesty – is not unlimited wealth.  That is tied for second place, with wishing better health and physical and intellectual attributes for family and friends.  My first ‘wish,’ upon which everything else depends, would be having unlimited control over all births and deaths (number, rate, age, etc.) for the next 50-100 years.

            The Rufo/Burnet spat is interesting because I think it presages what will happen whether or not the Democrats are able to sufficiently gin up the fraud machine to prevent a Trump Restoration. Con Inc will try another purge. It will be less overt with Trump, whereas with Harris it will indeed be Orwell’s boot, but Trump is beholden to his donors, and they are the same sort that bought Buckley. Maybe he will fink on them (it will be interesting to see which way the Vance/Thiel/Musk axis breaks), but it’s more likely he will fink on us.Ultimately, however, I believe they will fail, because liberalism itself has failed.

                When “Trumpism without Trump” was undefined it signifiedwhateverpolitical future for the historic American and his seemingly defeated nation—the possibility that it wasn’t over, that reports of our death were not only premature but wrong, that we’re still here in sufficient mass to dosomething, something that the person of Trump both signifies andholds back.Fast-forward through the emergency importation of at least tens of millions of “migrants,” etc.Now “the future of MAGA” is Vance and Vivek, genocidal enemies of the white loser, and Thiel and Elon, human zookeepers of the techno-apocalypse. The hell they’ll rule will have more Indians than Haitians in it, so we’ll be more menaced by censors who can’t speak English than by guys with machetes (but also by guys with machetes). That’s the onlysomethingwe get.The purge is over. Trumpwasassassinated. And he will be again, but it’s gratuitous.

            If spiritual or moral matters were involved – like convert or die! – then I think fewer would choose life and monies over selling out. But plenty would choose to convert or do something immoral so they can see their family again.
For political matters, heck yeah everyone has a price. Sorry fellow Z-readers, but if Harris-Walz gave me $10K to troll you guys in the comments, I’d do it in a heartbeat.

                    I guess it comes down to what you think is pardonable or not. Rufo is fine being paid by Jewish interests and might absolutely balk at Democrat donor bucks; I am the opposite.

                There are far worse things than trolling a bit in a blog. But would you actively campaign on behalf of Kamaltoe if paid to do so? Would you march in a Perv Pride parade on Christmas day carrying a placard showing some heauxmeaux blowing another? Would you telephone solicit on behalf of BLM? Would you write articles comdeming racism and pervophobia and extolling the virtues of diversity and unrestricted immigration?
If so, then well…I don’t even want to say.

        I started thinking about today’s topic from the basis of Ostei’s question about a replacement political dyad, and it is a more useful starting point. The question requires a different perspective.The dyad from the French Revolution was based on the fractured identity of the ruling class between Monarchists and Revolutionaries. The old American dyad is the split between brain hemispheres with one being feminine and the other being masculine, which connects back to the French Revolution due to how the masculine conservative right sided with the Monarchist identity while the feminine liberal left sided with the Revolutionary identity.The American ruling class identity was transformed from one based on the Constitutional Republic to one based on a Progressive Empire by Lincoln and the Republican Party. Calling the party of Progressive Empire “Republican” is a great bit of Machiavellian-style manipulation. Paleocons were the true holdouts for the Constitutional Republic identity and were defeated before they were born.A stable polity has a single identity* within the ruling class which is managed by a priest class and administered by the natural population split between the masculine right and feminine left. The *exception is when that single identity is inherently unstable like Progressive Empire. The archetype of the masculine right is Warrior-Priest while the archetype of feminine left is more like Nurturing Healer. The masculine side of the Progressive Empire became Cold War Hawks in keeping with their archetype while the feminine left took on the task of healing society via Civil Rights, both within the greater context of the Progressive Empire identity.A populist movement occurs when the ruling class identity does not overlap with the identity of the population they rule over, which is why the ruling class always closes ranks against populists movements and suppresses them because they are external threats to the ruling class on the basis of identity. This is the most recent American dyad and Western political realignment, and it signals a destabilized polity when the populist movement is not co-opted or crushed.The American story is more complicated because it involves the corruption of the left and right archetypes. The masculine right corrupts along psychopathic lines e.g. free trade, open borders to depress labor, finking on voters for donor cash, wars of choice and supremacy. The feminine left corrupts along narcissistic lines as the Devouring Mother or the Handmaiden of Lucifer. The Nanny State and managerialism are examples of the former while open borders and minority politics are more the latter. The Bolsheviks et al. supercharged the corruption of the feminine left in the name of a Communist Empire while the Zionists supercharged the corruption of the masculine right in the name of a Zionist Empire after the two groups were invited into the ruling class. The Communist Empire aligns with a Progressive Empire to the point where it did not constitute an entirely new identity. The Zionist Empire does constitute a second identity within the ruling class even though it gave the Cold War Hawks a new organizational purpose. This is where the new American ruling class dyad of Communist-Progressive vs. Zionist comes in while being nested within the ruling class vs. populist dyad.The inherent and inescapable problem of an unassimilated minority within the ruling class is it introduces new identities into the ruling class which destabilizes it until one reigns supreme by expelling all others. This problem can be suppressed during good times if the dominant identity is energetic and confident which is why the minority identity always undermines the majority identity. Nietzsche’s “will to power” of the minority identity demands it. The masculine right of the ruling class lost its organizational purpose to “The End of History” and its confidence to the Devouring Mother which made it easy prey for the new minority identity.After Conservatism has already been answered by Zionist Empire. After the Zionist Empire, the question of a new ethos for the masculine right will be answered when a new identity removes all that came before and the masculine archetype finds its role within the new identity.

With kingship/monarchy, the polity at least has the chance of righteous leadership.  With democracy — which is always feminine leading to feminist, there is no chance of righteous leadership.

If you are unsure about someone’s political opinions, find out how many kids/ grandkids they have.
Some grillers have large families, but they are easy to spot by the adopted negro.  But in general, if you meet someone with 5 or more kids and one wife, it is like a secret handshake (guns, gays, God, government).

        One interesting thing about the book I mentioned yesterday is that the author, if I’m not misunderstanding him, seems to be saying that these ‘modernizing’ Scottish thinkers were, in no small part, reacting against the hardline Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk of the time.This jibes with Quigley’s discussion of an historical dialectic of sorts, succeeding generations rejecting and reacting against the worldviews of previous ones.Particularly, the notion of human nature as good instead of evil— the softness we’ve yet to reject today. Why not? We’re still comfortable. It hasn’t materially failed us yet, although the pace has slowed and the signs of impending failure are there. I mean, when the promise is something as wild-eyed as transhumanism— of transcending the world and nature itself— you know they’re grasping at straws.I don’t think human nature is evil, but I do think it’s fallen, as is the world, and they both should be approached with caution rather than naivety or contempt.

            We’re a predator species. We’re killing or “playing with our food” (practice killing, reinforcing the drive), breeding or being driven not to breed. The rest is whiteness.
The great Scots were the most white, Maxwell probablythemost. We’ve progressed a lot since then. “Scottish Enlightenment” is a phrase the kids never learn, but if they heard it they’d know it waswrong.

                That thing about being predators. Animals. I was thinking about that, thought maybe we have rejected man’s good nature.It’s the 19th century thing, I understand, the animal nature. Darwin and all of that. Then I thought, greed is good, for instance. Iow, even our basest instincts can be harnessed for the good. So maybe we really haven’t rejected the good nature, although focusing on the animal makes it hard not to become cynical. Idk.Anyway, it’s weird, the 20th-21st century view. We’re animals, but we’re becoming gods. Or maybe only some of us (the fittest/chosen/elect/whatever) will be gods, or maybe they’re the animals, because they act like predators. Something’s got to give, you’d think.Is this the whiteness present day hates, or is it what you get when you give it to people it doesn’t suit? What a mess!

        It’s good that you (Z) pointed out that the antebellum South was hierarchical, beyond having slavery.  It was an oligarchy.  I appreciate hierarchy.  It’s necessary, as you said.  But there were a lot of poor whites in the South who were effectively shut out from rising very high.  I have sympathy for the Confederacy, as well as sympathy for the North.  It was much more complex than many people recognize.  For example, Lincoln is bashed, maybe rightly, for suspending habeas corpus, but Jefferson Davis did that also during the war.You don’t hear much about them, but there were men with good will, both North and South, who tried hard to avoid the terrible war that came.  Their voices were drowned out by more strident voices, North and South.  I admire the poor whites of the South who fought for the Confederacy, who objected to being invaded, and I also admire the Rebel aristocrats who wanted to save their civilization, and the Northerners who fought for their way of life.  The Union wasn’t just a hollow phrase to them.It seems that blacks and whites were a lot better off under Segregation.  Crime rates, family structure, and educational success make this pretty clear.  A hierarchy with a Christian moral basis, and certain other foundations, can work very well.  Black slavery really was a very tough issue to deal with, though, before the Civil War.

            Very high sounding, but as far as I’m aware, there were no “Northerners who fought for their way of life.”  No one in Massachusetts or New York was invaded or had his home burned down by rampaging Southrons telling them they were evil and immoral people who had noright to their own lives and livelihoods.  I’ve seen estimates that 43-53% of the Union army were immigrants or the sons of immigrants.  I don’t believe the Irish and Germans of the time were ardent abolitionists fighting for the freedom and equality of sub-Saharan Africans.

                Actually lots of northerners did fight for their way of life, like my great-great grandfather who was a blacksmith in the North. Their economy was affected by what the South did. The Union was filled with yeoman farmers and artisans who joined up fighting for the Union. A slave economy had implications for them. The loss of the Mississippi River to a hostile power would have had major effects also, for regular people in the North.There’s the stereotype today that the Union Army was mostly industrial workers and immigrants off the boat. Not true by a long shot in the early years, until the attrition killed so many.And actually,  many of the recently arrived Germans were abolitionists.

            Somewhat, but there is another dimension. Z refers to the destruction of the Southern aristocracy, but in fact some of it remained quite intact after the war. Many of the upper class became what were termed “scalawags,” collaborators with the Union occupiers. What we now would term lower and middle class Southerners often wanted the blacks expelled after the war but the aristocratic remnant most certainly did not because many former slaves continued as low wage laborers. What is now called “share cropping” sprung from the phenomenon. The upper class won the argument in part due to its collaboration with the Radical Republicans.One of the great myths of American history is that pre-war Southern whites were either extremely poor or aristocrats. The great Fugitive Movement writer Andrew Nelson Lytle pulled all land records he could obtain and found the average Southerner was a small farmer who did not own slaves yet was relatively prosperous for the time, certainly in comparison to white farmers in the Midwest and especially the Irish and German immigrants who comprised nearly half of the Union army. Lytle, who no longer is required or even accepted reading, is as a direct result hated even though he is one of the country’s great fiction writers (THE VELVET HORN is among America’s best-crafted novels). I’m of the opinion that the hierarchal tensions of the South would have resulted in an intra-regional war if the Union had lost in part due to this conflict among whites. All Southern whites were race realists, but those outside the aristocracy wanted blacks gone, full stop.

        the breathlessly prolific podcaster calling zimself Jim Burton interviewed that guy Tucker interviewed about the ww2. At about 10 min the “historian” (I don’t think he is a historian in the way we thinking , but more like a passionate. D very smart amateur) gives the best summary about why we should be skeptical abouttt the ww2 mythology.he then takes veers to some French philosopher some or other who talked about the need for blood sacrifice to unite a fractured people in a common crime; something the author insisted was necessary for until Christ’s sacrifice.the guest implies that this is exactly what ww2 was, a blood sacrifice of krauts and nips to unite a western people that had lost its faith and reverted while perhaps not paganism but to a secularism that nonetheless needed once again a sacrifice.i had heard of this author the first mentioned long ago but my point is that conservatism may be necessary in this type of “country” if it is built on these phony myths. I think Mr man’s allusion to the radical liberal founding of the us is in line with this too. Consetivism is either part of the moving train of liberalism or its operating within a phony myth like ww2

            The whole interview is actually quite good. He suggests now that the us is non white that another sacrifice to create a new myth is coming.
i bet they could just use maga and extend the Nazi/ confederate thing . If the civil war was a blood sacrifice was ww2 just a world scale of that?

            That‘some French philosopher or other’is none other than the late great René Girard, mentor to Peter Thiel amongst others.
Personally I find Girard’s views on mimesis and mimetic desire to be compelling and congruent with observed reality. Less convinced by his all too tidy wrapping it up in a bow conclusion that the advent of Christianity put a stop to the communal strife, pharmakos, catharsis cycle.

                I’d like to register my respectful disapproval of the term “civilizationalism,” because it maintains the same universalism that doomed us.
I’m not in support of a civilization that threatens my own, just because it is advanced.  (Derb and Ramzpaul are unable to learn this lesson with respect to Israel.)
In fairness, I don’t have some clever new name to tide us over until we can stop hiding our beliefs and be explicitly ethnonationalist.  Once we don’t have to dissemble any longer, names like “White Scotland” or “White Montana” will do just fine.

        But America wasn’t founded as a Radical Experiment, Americans were settlers who found themselves betrayed to London Bankers and the East India company, who settled on a form of government that was 2000 years old when they examined and applied this solution, to choose a Republic over King Washington was also the best solution, because as much as they distrusted and came to despise London they didn’t trust each other either.Not that dissenters offer any solutions other than “race realism.”  Ok.
