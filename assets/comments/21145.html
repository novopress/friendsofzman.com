        Tuned into the RNC last night. Trump was slobbering over a Hijabi, a Sari, an African, and a Hispanic who just got sworn in as citizens.Next up Eric Trump, looking like a homeless coke addict, bragged about the lowest black/woman/Hispanic unemployment in 6 million years.Then First Black Man in Position X in Kentucky came and spoke. Then I turned it off. Sure didn’t look or sound like any Trump rally I’ve seen.You’re totally right that it’s marketed to a people who no longer exist. It’s outdone only by the DNC whose message also ignores reality. Z, you put things into words, that people notice but can’t define themselves – ie. Ds and Rs are fighting battles of the past with no relevance today.

                You miss the devil created by the press.  The one thing I never had any delusions about with Trump was his alleged racism.  Don’t get me wrong, I am as disillusioned with him as anyone else, but I always knew he wasn’t racist or even racially aware.But what I didn’t understand at the time, but should have, is why the press was constantly calling him a white supremacist.  The reason they do it is not because they believe it, at least not in a literal way. It’s because they want to have a written record that can be referenced in the future.  When everyone in the present is dead, the one thing that will exist and be easily searchable is the New York Time microfilms or whatever archive technology that exists in the year 2100.  They call themselves the paper of record. It’s one of those phrases with 2 meanings. One of those meanings is they are recording the present for the people in the future.

                    I think Trump is very racially aware, but in an abstract rather than a judgmental way.  He chooses not to act on race, and consciously does not act on it.  He is always sizing up people across the table from him, friend or foe.  He operates by setting his opponents up to personally fall, and going overtly racial would put him at a disadvantage at doing that.  This is part of his singling out individuals for his vicious criticism, but not groups. He is not our guy, but there is a lot to learn from the guy, tactically.

                        Oh, I agree wholeheartedly. Trump’s tactics are fantastic.I don’t expect him to be our guy, but the pandering is weak as shit.  It makes him look weak and let’s not forget all the criminal gibs Kushner pushed for.  No matter what happens, blacks are never going to support him.  At best, they stay home.  But they like Biden and are highly motivated in a way they were not in 2016.

                        so he believes in individuals are above groups. boomer, even if more based than most. then again, the dissidence, specially the seculars, believe all there is are the magic genes, and that’s not true either.relatedly, one bright spot was Rand Paul claiming there’s be no more war if Trump was reelected. and another, the defenses made of medical professionals of Trump’s covid reaction, which could have been more ordered but definitely trying to put things back together. also, the emphasis on mothers rather than just women power, and an implicit appeal to white mothers. for whatever those few bright spots were worth… but yeah the rest was a lot of Con Inc and Kushner-approved-diversity stuff. Gaetz and Kirk look like Richard Spencer in comparison.at least the McCluskey dude sounded like Jared Taylor, lol.

                    “racially aware”


That’s a keeper.

It goes down much more smoothly than, “hell yes, I’m a racist, because everyone is”.

Thanks, gonna use it if I ever open my big yap and actually have an opinion again.

Non-whites, for instance, nod in agreement when I say, “People are different, we have different ways.”
They like the recognition, anybody but cucks seeking approval would.

                        racially-aware may get you in trouble, though it can get by maybe, specially in higher-iq circles. but yeah, when you simply say “people are different” the others simply nod respectfully, if perhaps a bit warily. then again, that’s better than their usual uppity-ness based on taking advantage of cucking.

‘Second Black Man in Position X’ and ‘Third Black Man in Position X’ are also accolades that have been used in biographies of various public figures. Not too sure about where it ends, ‘The Nth Black Man in Position X’… Of course, this assumes that the ordinal is the only variable. It could well be that ‘Black Man’ may be replaced with:

                Was talking to my father the other day about the sorry state of blacks. Now, this is a man who 100% fully understands the genetic differences and that, barring outside intervention, culture follows biology.
But here’s his final thoughts on the matter, and I quote: “I just don’t what we (Whites) did wrong.”
It was like talking to Winston Smith after his time with O’Brien. My dad was staring at four fingers and wondering why he was seeing five.

                You can’t argue with Breitbart people.  Only as a mental exercise, like a Sudoku.  God created grim death to clean out bad politics like that.  They’re sitting at their computers with oxygen tanks before going out to the Indian casino.

                That’s right, he knows us angry white guys will gripe and complain but still grudgingly come back to him for the general, like a battered spouse.Personally i just find it humorous, we do live in clown world. I support Trump because 1) as a symbolic FU to the global elites and 2) he causes the “left” to overreach and expose their insanity. I believe a Biden/Kamala would be a return to the “slow boil” process.Honestly my only solutions right now are 1) link up with like minded people (even if it’s just a few), 2) find a “team” – ie. a white evangelical church, gun club etc. Even if they’re not our guys they still play for our team. 3) follow what citizen outlines a few days ago. 4) don’t forget to enjoy life.

That few, if you’re fortunate enough to live relatively close by and in a rural area, could be the basis for a small, tight-knit community. Even if you’re in some urban hell-hole, having just a single ally is a tremendous boon – not just for the sake of venting thoughts and frustration, but because you begin to network in the real world.
Also, identify some useful skill/s and practice them.

                            Cell structure is a mandatory social tech/op sec for Our Guys to master, especially operating “inside the wire.”Even our larger IRL communities should use this internally for decision-making and between communities to make ourselves more resistant to infiltration and limit its impact.Inevitably some guys are going to get targeted and some will inevitably collaborate.  You have to plan for worst-case scenarios.  Avoid being wholly centralized and always have contingency plans for bugging-out and regrouping.Invest in your communities with a dollar for now and a dollar in the “oh shit” fund strategy.For a larger-scale IRL implementation, see the South African Broederbundhttps://theamericansun.com/2019/12/16/so-you-want-to-build-a-mannerbund/

I don’t think it’ll make a difference with regards to immigration. Crushing white nations is the prime directive of the globalists and such strategic decisions are taken above the POTUS’ level, irregardless of who he is. They’re all sock puppets voiced by the same puppeteer.
Maybe it makes a difference on minor matters like infrastructure spending or health care; after all, the globalists don’t have time or resources to micromanage everything, so the sock puppet gets a few hundred billions to play president with.

                        Yes – Trump makes Whitey go to sleep thinking someone is protecting them. Obama was the best thing for hard-Right recruiting since the Black Panthers.
Trump has not even tried to slow down the anti-White juggernaut. His veto pen is buried in his desk under a stack of Tablet mags and a couple of Playboys. His DoJ has enthusiastically prosecuted his own supporters while antifas get let out of jail.

                        Yes, Gespenst. So many commenters here could be exchanged for the commenters on so many libertarian lists with their huffing and puffing and peacockery about who hates Trump the most and how him getting elected “won’t change anything” and how there won’t be any difference whether Trump or Biden is elected. Reason doesn’t seem to make much of an impact.

                            Things get interesting if Biden is elected. He is obviously deteriorating mentally and would soon be put in some kind of home. Kamala Harris, who really hates whitey, then takes over. The entire federal government, stirred up like a hornets’ nest by Trumps election, will swarm all over any wrong thinkers on command from Queen Kamala. I don’t believe the “won’t change anything” dissident righters have thought through what might be coming to them.

            That somebody would watch these circuses it is beyond my comprehension But apparently many did and according to their accounts they look like any previous minus covidYet the war has been raging on the streets while normies watch “conventions” gripped by fear and cowardice hopping that somehow things will turn out right and they will continue to live their lives as comfortably as they always haveThe lack of courage and IQ is obvious but I wish to underline another much more important parameter so to speak, the total lack of instinct for survivalIt has been killed for 70+ years by cheap entertainment and above by the sedation in massive agitprop factories aka edmuhcational system

        The only thing more pathetic than the modern bugmen who think themselves revolutionaries are the stupid placcid normies who let their neighborhoods get burned down and their livelihoods destroyed.Just sixty years ago ethnic communities would mobilize at just one black person entering the neighborhood. They knew, more would come, and the cascade effect would destroy their community. They also knew there were upper powers who were intentionally trying to destroy them.Reading history now, it was the racist homeowners who were bigots to the non-threatening outsiders and their fears it would destroy the community were unfounded. Then it skips entirely the part of white flight followed by the destruction of their community, completely vindicating their views.Now their older children get teary eyed as they get displaced by a foreign people and culture and have no idea what a community entails.

            My wife told a story years ago about how her neighborhood responded vigorously when a black family moved in- all the sorts of low-level terrorism a Southern town might utilize: dog crap on the porch, scratched cars, that sort of thing.
When she first told me the story decades ago, she felt shame that her neighbors had acted in that way. Now, she thinks they were right to act with a calibrated level of unlawful behavior.

                That is happening a lot across the South now. The place has become a tinderbox, and toppling Confederate statues and monuments, to the extent they still exist, probably isn’t a very healthy pastime now.

                    That’s hard to believe. I’ve lived in South Carolina. Every white man believes every negro male has the potential to bring an SEC championship to his favorite college. They worship football more than Jesus.

                This is something we need to bring back. Scare them. Make them uncomfortable. But do it very surreptitiously and don’t do anything that could be construed as life-threatening. Once the Hutus start getting the big photo, they might decide that behaving like semi-civilized human beings isn’t such a bad option after all.

                    Why not watch the many videos of Black / Police interactions? Now, take into consideration that most of those injured or killed by the police would have survived if they had not been acting stupid, violent, resisting arrest, etc. Do you honestly think there is anything rational civilization can teach the dregs of Melanic Hominids™?

        They don’t need to have a continuous revolution – they just need people to think they’re in one.

Zoomer wahmen think they’re the first generation to have sexual liberation and to ride the carousel. Zoomer men think they’re the first generation to experiment with drug use. Everyone knows that in the before times (before the year *I* happen to be born), racism was rampant. Anti-racism is totally new!

No way the un-cool racist sexist misogynist old people ever did that stuff back in the day! They keep the revolution going in young peoples’ minds through hatred of their elders. Satanic.

            So true. Satanic is right. The “do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law” is wedded to the “year I”.Yet there is a coming home to roost aspect to all of this.Reverence and respect for elders – which is also what carries much of our shared history and culture, is difficult to cultivate when most of the elders refuse to age themselves and step into the various roles of actually being an elder and not just another competitor in the already crowded field.If oldness and all its glorious wisdom and humility is rejected out of hand by those who would embody it, why would the children value it? The messaging has been quite clear.These noodle boys have been gelded and handicapped such that their more than equal women can compete with them, then lord over them, then somehow also become a mate in spite of the natural sexual polarity and status hierarchy being inverted.You want to build a supplicating beta army of nihilists and hedonists, thats how. You want to build a hive of barren wombs and narcissistic vapid consumers with anxiety and swollen amygdalae, thats how.The cult of the child, from helicopter-snowflakes to marathoning boomers with new $40k robotic knees and perpetual “dating” well into our 60’s is hardly demonstrable of a culture that values its ancients – or its future. Manchilren who cry out “Burn it all” is not some random mutation of a petulant child.I agree that its a spiritual battle and our children occupy the front lines. So what can we do in our own lives, through our own choices to demonstrate to our children what we value and what we desire for them to inherit?

From what I read, and that may be wrong, Zoomer women are the most anti-sex generation of human females since the days of Cotton Mather.

        Spot on. It is the Year Zero and the 68’ers and the 85’ers want to party like it is 1999.There is a split screen quality to these political conventions, which really should be run in black and white as it is. On the right side of the screen, people yell the modern equivalent “Tippercanoe and Tyler, Too!” while on the left side of the screen statues of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler are toppled and their descendants assaulted and put to the torch.For laughs I visited NRO yesterday. There was a prominent story about how Hezbollah needs to be put down in Lebanon, and no mention of the much worse events unfolding in the streets of America. The cognitive-dissonance was off the charts, even more so than normal. That molded, irrelevant institution will require a time machine to visit soon enough.Unlike the pseudo-revolutions of the Sixties and Eighties, though, this conflagration of anti-White nihilism likely will be permanent and lead to multiple nations within the boundaries of the former United States. This also started as a pseudo-revolution but it has spiraled out of control and also is coming now for the aged leftists and/or Woke Capital that paid for it, coming from both sides, actually. Tribute may work with low IQ, feral blacks but it doesn’t deter True Believers.The Empire will end with a bang as “conservatives” and upper middle class “radicals” whimper.

                Even if the conservatives don’t fight back, and you have every reason to doubt they will, there will be multiple nations. We have them now and they are quite diverse.

                    Harsh opinion – Those with a pulse should have left years ago. Surely they recognized the signs of Marxist creep, and the fact that leftists were a growing majority? Well and good to be armed and alert, but not so good after things get spicy and the “jury of your peers” is a bunch of progressive whites.This is the big lesson-learned for me and mine – we have to constantly observe cultural reality and act accordingly. Doesn’t matter if my kith &amp; kin have been in such &amp; such county for 200 years – the question we should all be asking is, “Do my values align with my community’s prevailing culture? Are theseMY PEOPLE?” If the answer is no, even after having attempted a series of community wake-up calls, it’s time to move.I hope for eventual partition in the long-term. In the short-term it’s important that we’re eyes-wide-open on our community’s cultural climate, and be willing to collocate with our people.

                            As has been fleshed out many times on this blog, progressive whites are to be avoided as much as feral blacks. How is that hard to understand?
Warning signs?  Plentiful for the observant man.  Things like increasing faggotry and decreasing families.  Rabid feminists gathered in the local Starbucks.  Local voting trends and School Board decisions.  The masked scowling at the unmasked.  Signs aplenty.

                                    We’re on the same side here but think we’re talking past one another.“I have to figure out a way of avoiding people that look like me but with different views.”Your sarcasm is reality; this is ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.  Getting away from The Diversity™ is a subset of the solution but as we all know, coexisting with white progressives is an impossibility.“There is no running from this.”OK, but which hill do you want to defend first?  Chicago?  Portland?  Kenosha?  See my point?  People from our side need to collocate with fellow travelers in defendable strongholds, not in areas the progressives have held for decades.

                                        Yes its difficult to sort the White from the white. But it must be done. The extent to which varies somewhat on the goodness of said whites. Geography and demography alike have insurmountable points and passes.The subtleties only exist within the comforts of “mostly white” decadence. But in advance of some mythological collapse that forces such divides to reveal themselves in constant contrast, the burden is upon us to find our people and build up trust and reliance in advance of – and regardless of – some coming catastrophe, be it civwar 2.0 or meteor.White guys with guns protecting storefronts from mobs of mostly white guys with guns and flamey jogger-shoppers in tow q mere three months after those same storefronts were forced closed by whites without guns because flu…Somewhere in there is an answer. Or at least the right questions.

                            The thing that’s always glossed over in regards to the Rooftop Koreans is that they were defending their own property, and perhaps that of their community.  There’s only one business close to me that I would put in to that group, but oddly enough it’s owned by a Big Corp and I’m sure they would rather it be torched than have locals defend it.

                        Yep the FBI ATF DHS and US Marshalls will punch well into overtime to surveil and eventually SWAT these white agitators when the time is right for their story. CNN will be there too so the goodwhite pron can play on a loop. Feelz good.In my “conservative” mostly white city someone spray painted “white lives matter” around a bus stop. Of course it also included some poorly sketched notsee symbols just to drive home the white=notsee for those white normies starting to feel frisky.Local mews had a package on it within the hour. The eyewitness who apparently first saw it was…wait for it… a ghey blaq male!. It was “horrific” it squealed.The mews hairdo’s opener: “according to the SPLC, white lives matter is a white supremacist hate group”. The trifecta.Undoubtedly a task force of white cops are “investigating” this “hate crime” while the looted buildings and broken windows of ongoing peaceful protests are boarded-up and forgotten.The city, not short on potholes, needles, and graffiti in general, had scrubbed the paint by the 8:05am bus. By the next news cycle, BLM graffiti, 10x as much, covered the entire area. “No Racism Here”. A collective goodwhite sigh. The right side of history is so cozy.The city has no plans to remove it. False flag spider sense aside, it is still not okay to be white. Trump knows this. He also knows he has white votes regardless. The Repubs have their plantation too.The cringe factor of watching proud boyz “notsees” larp in renaissance festival gallantry with the noodle army while filming themselves with one arm is almost as bad as these “I’m on your side bro!” Soylent-15 shock troops getting lip cucked by a sheeboon.“there were decent people on both sides” is an error that won’t be repeated. The second act has already been written. Casting calls now, BYOAR15.

                            I’ve seen multiple reports of “police investigations” into KKK-covid gear being worn in East County San Diego (home of Klantee).  Notoriously wignat Torrance had recent raycisms as well.
Just what crime is being investigated?

                                That’s it. Listen to the Imperial Political Police when they are interviewed. They always do a “both sides” thing yet never seem to arrest the actual perps, the communists who are their allies. The FBI/DOJ had little credibility with anyone left before this happened.

                                Exactly. The “hate” crime modifier is just one of many codified anti-white identity laws that exists solely as a frontlash weapon of anarcho-tyranny and patsy generating agitprop mechanism.
These clever regulations are both an electric fence around goodwhite moral superiority, keeping whiteness corralled as sheep, and as gateways in which greater federal powers can enter the “mostly white” communities should the sheep start getting all wolfie.
The crime is white identity.

        The idiocy of “antiracist” pro-BLM libertarians who have taken the FBI’s “boogaloo” bait is breathtaking.
Not only are these idiots marching around supporting BLM:https://twitter.com/ElijahSchaffer/status/1298459563629457408
But there’s also speculation that the Kenosha shooter might have been one of these “antiracist” boogaloogers:https://twitter.com/ElijahSchaffer/status/1298506102049591296
The guy of course had the right to defend himself since he was attacked by thugs, but if he hadn’t paraded around with BLM in the first place he wouldn’t be in this situation right now. Libertarians have learned nothing from Garrett Foster.
Libertarians may very well have a lower average IQ than blacks.

            The Kenosha County Sheriff has already announced that arrests are coming. The shooter will likely be arrested and charged with murder and a host of other charges. Even if he is acquitted, this will ruin his life.Kenosha is a Blue city in a Blue state and should be left to burn. But if these people feel compelled to go into a combat zone they need to wear fatigues, a full face mask, helmet and gloves so they can’t readily be identified. It would be far more effective to hit a few random targets from a distance and GTFO before anyone can get a fix on you.

        This was the case with the Bolsheviks. The revolution carried on through the war and into the Cold War.
Indeed. Over the last week I have been reading John Reed’sTen Days That Shook The Worldand the thing that struck me the most was the way the Bolshevik key players would talk non-stop about ‘The Revolution’ as though it was a flame that could never be extinguished.

        Society may be in constant flux but the Harvard Crimson still manage to ride highest in the tide that grifts all boats.As Heartiste often said, our present culture is prime territory for Dark Triad predators. We’ve all seen the studies that show how leadership in the managerial state correlates strongly with narcissism, sadism and pathological deceitfulness.These sharks grow fat on White Americans adrift in a sea of poz, blinded by rainbow glitter and deafened by sirens bewailing their thirsty WAP’s. Anyone who’s seen “Jaws” knows the vibe.When you’re cast adrift, you stay together, hold each other up, use whatever floats and figure out who knows where they’re going.Lifeboats are out there but there isn’t room enough for everyone. Climb aboard while you still can.

        I don’t know a whole lot about the 50s and 60s cultural “revolution” and “civil rights” movement, but the one thing I do know is that it is probably all lies.  The current narrative about the revolutions of the 50s and 60s is the good guys who were “non-violent” and staged peaceful resistance against the fascist forces of the South is as much of a lie as the current “peaceful” “civil rights” protests happening right now.The babies of today in 2070 will be reading about the peaceful summer of love of 2020 when the “good-whites” and “people of color” peacefully marched against the fascist forces of the urban cities of “Trump’s America.”  CHAZ will be their Woodstock!  There will be documentaries interviewing the now senior citizens who were there as 20-somethings in 2020 who were there. We’ll hear about their planting of the crops to feed the homeless and how the fascist mayor was secretly poisoning the crops.  Saint Floyd of Minneapolis will be their Emit Till who dindu nuffin and was killed for no reason whatsoever other than being black.That is why this nostalgia seems so phony.  It is!   They are celebrating a period that is actually a narrative that never happened.

                It’s funny because we are not a natural Republican constituency.  The GOP has always been full of cucks and traitors.  It was founded as an abolitionists party.  It was the party of big business and race egalitarianism and now it’s the party of cucks and big business “libertarians”The historic Democrat party is FAR more natural party for the dissident “right,” particularly the race conscious dissident right. The Democrats got taken over by progressive loons even worse on the race issue than the cucks in the GOP.

        Nostalgia is a multibillion dollar industry. There are board rooms all over the world trying to figure out how to separate people from their money By selling them Reproductions of things they held near and dear or experiences with people or places that are long gone. Being on the edge of the baby bloomers spectrum 1964,  I realized in my 30’sThat 1978 Ain’t coming back, and that when nostalgia crossed over to sentimentality my wallet was lighter And I wasn’t paying attention to what was in front of me. Maybe that’s the whole point of it. Distraction.

        Another great column, you’re on a roll.&lt;i&gt;It is common to call the 1960’s a cultural revolution. Some say it was the sexual revolution or maybe the youth revolution. Still others point out that the revolution started in the 1950’s with black civil rights. &lt;/i&gt;Or in the WWII, when the women started working industry jobs in large numbers. Or the twenties, when the Old World was in smoking ruins and people decided to burn down Old World culture as well and start again with dada and bauhaus, and when women started smoking and cut their hair short. In the nineteenth century, it was the death of god and the ascent of rule by man and so forth.It’s revolutions all the way down.

            Ironically, the only reason this revolution continues is b/c of the huge power of the state. If we were to get rid of the police there’d be no one to come arrest you for doing a racism, and the country would balkanize faster.
It is the natural prerogative of the patriarchal man to enforce order in his sphere. The police took this away. Now we have the delicate white man hiding from the black man behind a (very porous) wall of blue. Remove the blue wall, and let the white man remember how to defend himself.

                Yeah as long as the cops and the family court judges also retreat from his kitchen table.As long as State power resides between a man and his wife and children the blaq man on the street is just one more symptom of that problem.Thats why continuing to invest in the various political and other apparatuses that perpetuate state power while complaining about state power is insanity.Arguing over which brand of psychopath tyrant deserves to sit at your own table while ignoring the actual premise that it has no right to be there at all is hardly the path forward.But hell yes if it takes a poc with a frozen gatorade bottle to knock a white mans testes loose, then that would be bigger accomplishment than peanut butter.

        Well, here is the test.  TPTB have just discovered that the Antifa/BLM violence sends people Trump’s way, rather than away from him (duh).  Will it stop on a dime?  So much of what has been going on these last few years (Wuflu panics, Russiagate, impeachment, all the racial stuff) just appears so staged to me.  It seems to be about, and mostly only about, removing the tick from the deep state’s neck that is Trump.  If the nightly violence goes away by the first of the week, we will know how much things are being staged.  If it continues, we know instead that the BLM attack dog has slipped its leash.

            Dutch said: “If the nightly violence goes away by the first of the week, we will know how much things are being staged. If it continues, we know instead that the BLM attack dog has slipped its leash.”The problem for the democrats is that there are a lot of amateurs out there mixing it up for personal reasons. the least of which is grand theft. So I can’t see how they could just flip a switch. And as for the BLM block heads “slipping their leash “, the management will obay orders I’m sure. As for the rank and file, that will probably take a little longer. And all the various antifa groups aren’t listening to anybody.

        I haven’t been following the conventions. I’m way more worried about which town black murderers and their white/Jewish apologists will destroy next, and whether my family is at risk.
The conventions could not be more out of touch with the reality on the ground, and it’s hard enough keeping track of the mayhem and wondering if you’re in danger than wasting time trying to follow the irrelevant theatrics on TV.

                        It didn’t end will for BLM/Antifa.The same things have happened in other small towns. Zinc, AR; Ft. Collins, CO; some small inland town in California early in the riots — the antifa soyboys and a few joggers roll in and find a bunch of armed men and/or men willing to mix it up and no big city Dem-controlled police dept. willing to stop them and the Antifa/BLM are eitherverypolite or running for their lives in short order.Zinc, AR is only about 100 people. Barely a wide spot in the road, but a KKK leader lives there. BLM showed up and the road was lined with local armed White men and the road to the KKK leader’s house was blocked off.That protest was not just “mostly peaceful,” it was entirely peaceful. Because it better be, or else.

In the interim to possible future spicy times utilize your social network to isolate and locally vilify these Quislings. It is harsh but unless you are in an irredeemable wokester area you must harden your heart and try to excise this cancer.
Rumor, shunning, innuendo and the evil eye are your tools at this stage.

                All I can say is I plan to sit out the election period in our second, more rural home. I doubt our city would erupt as the jogger population is low. But it also is a college town and quite liberal, so the antifags could stir things up as well. Come the end of October thru at least middle of November. I think this election is going to be a barn burner no matter who wins, but especially if trump pulls it off.

                    Probably a good idea and an even better one to be prepared for an extended stay if this becomes your plan.

There are some legs to the idea that we may not even know who is the next President until the new year as delays in counting, disputes, and legal appeals may postpone the decision.

        The true believers at Powerline thought it was one of the great moments in the history of the Republic. For what its worth, last night’s poll dump showed Trump improving in several states.In what I thought was a very odd ad campaign, I have started getting a YouTube ad featuring Chuck Schumer essentially screaming that Senate Democrats need the help of “grassroots donors” like me to “ditch Mitch” and retake the Senate. Given the resources these people have it is an incredibly bad ad even if I was inclined to support them. My entire YouTube history is nothing but classical music, Christian hymns, videos geared for preschoolers and RamzPaul. This is obviously a very widely distributed ad. The amount of waste in political advertising is just staggering.

            I don’t have a YouTube or Social History presence.   I am guilty of donating some $ to Trump in 2016.  The other day’s mail included gimme letters from the RNCC, Wounded Warriors, some group against Common Core, and Zioclops.  Oh, and a phone call from Cornyn.

                That is at least targeted based on your donation to Trump in 2016.  They will sell your name and address and any other contact info you give them to any group that will pay for it, which is another reason never to donate to a political campaign.  What I saw had to be a blanket ad they paid to show after any monetized YouTube video.  Campaign consultants don’t care that much about the results as long as they get paid.

        Some argue that the Civil War was a second founding of the nation, a rework of the first, but repairing the flaws in the original founding.Pretty sure USA was intended to be an masonic experiment from very early on, the new Atlantis, a place where the sciences that originated in Christian Europe, will be applied in order to create a luciferian world.US perpetual revolution state can be seen as taking the populations of the world and molding them like in a test lab into whatever the elite want them to be, this could be seen when looking at every american gen, each decade people become even more twisted.

            Right? Every once in a while they will put some near-retarded slug from the FBI or whatever on the tube and he will proclaim how non-political their agency is and, hey, “we are looking for the Klan as well as the communists behind these riots!” Part of it is straight up lying because their Imperial masters sponsor the Marxists, but no small part of it is due to a near-geriatric memory of what the FBI did in the past.

        OT but interesting…an excerpt from a book recommended by commenters here – Christus Liberator An Outline Study of Africa.—[Dr.] Livingstone wrote to his daughter from the Manyuema country in 1870:“The men (carriers) sent by Dr Kirk are Mohammedans, that is, unmitigated liars. Musa and his companions are fair specimens of the lower class of Moslems. The two headmen remained at Ujiji, to feast on my goods, and get pay without work. Seven came to Bambarré, and in true Moslem style swore that they were sent by Dr. Kirk to bring me back, not to go with me, if the country were bad or dangerous. Forward they would not go. I read Dr Kirk/s words to them to follow wheresoever I led. ‘No, by the old liar Mohammed, they were to force me back to Zanzibar.’ After a superabundance of falsehood it turned out that it all meant only an advance of pay, though they had double the Zanzibar wages. I gave it, but had to threaten on the word of an Englishman to shoot the ring-leaders before I got them to go. They all speak of the English as men who do not lie. … I have travelled more than most people and with all sorts of followers. The Christians of Kuruman and Kolobeng were out of sight the best I ever had. The Makololo, who were very partially Christianized, were next best – honest, truthful, and brave. Heathen Africans are much superior to the Mohammedans, who are the most worthless one can have.”—I’ve read Carlyle’s exposition on Mohammed which contains quite a bit of praise. Whatever the origins my experience with most Moslems is in line with Dr. Livingstone’s, and I’d be interested to discover what Arabs were like before Islam, and if it has improved their race at all.

            So true.  As Z said, “Those behind [the unrest] are trying to conjure a familiar bogeyman from the past.”  The media and entertainment industry always pushing excitement.  Circular agitation.  Every year Hollywood pumps out more “Don’t Forget what Whitey did to You” movies.   MSM follows with “Don’t You See They’re Still Doing it to You!?”  Lefty leadership is like the perpetually angry spastic basketball coaches.  “What are you doing sitting on your couch Tyrone!

        You explain it well because our current situation always strikes me as so odd.  Given their behavior, ideology, and the damage they’ve done, of course we should be in a full-blown cold war with China.  And of course we should be warming to Russia and trying to draw them to our side of the confrontation with China – they are more at risk than we are.

        I see it in the business world. As we baby boomers get older and retire or die the level of managers just below us in their late 40’s are trying to manage the younger generation below them like they managed the baby boomers. Problem is it ain’t working well.The next generation of American workers are different and require a different mindset. The current generation of managers is nostalgic for the way America used to work.They are like Hitler ordering around competent armies of workers that no longer exist.Its not only the political world that is nostalgic for the 80’s. The business world is too.

The list goes on and on. My generation needs to stfu and deal with real life – that kind of lifestyle just doesn’t exist for 90% of us.

            The next generation of American workers are different and require a different mindset.I have noticed this too. The other day, whilst listening to my boss expound on his ‘leadership’ ability, it occurred to me that his ‘hands off approach’ and his ‘laid back style’ would not result in the same fruits with a different batch of workers – say, ones from a younger generation who thought that ‘being asked to work’ was against their rights… Those who take no pride in work and wish to turn it into a social club.It was yet another reminder that whilst it is nice to have a set of rules that you can apply, and that have worked for you in the past, they may not work in the future. Upon realizing this, my boss may then make the connection that it was not leadership (in the sense he imagines it) at all that bore the fruit – rather that he had a competent and disciplined workforce that did not need a lot of supervision.All this is not to say that leadership/management is worthless, but that both manager and managed have to live up to certain expectations in order for things to be done to a decent standard. From what I have personally witnessed of fresh graduates in the workplace, many bring in an attitude that is just not compatible with this dynamic – and heaven help you if you’re the dreaded white man manager and the new cohort of trainees contains mystery meat galore.

                It’s all about emotional management.
The boss has to prove he’s on “their side” – the same way the NBA coaches have to cuck to BLM or the players will ignore them.
Young people generally have a poor social life and limited communities – not to mention Netflix that makes the corporate world appear much more thrilling than it really is.
Their expectation is that work will be their social club. Of course instead of wild hookups in the janitor’s closet, in real life most people just want to gtfo at 5.

                    Their expectation is that work will be their social club.This has been one of the most unbearable things to witness. I will say that it is mostly females who wish for this to be true, and to some extent for them it is. But you’re correct, for most people work is just a way to eke out a living – nothing more. If you are fortunate enough to enjoy your work that is great, but I have never understood the obsession people have with the ‘career’ – as if nothing outside of it matters.I have gotten more satisfaction from growing cucumbers and even making pizza dough than I ever had from my job – and this was I job I thought I wanted! You know: ‘Do something you’re passionate about!’.Once you realize how little you can make do with, once you stop consuming so much, and concentrate on things that are important to you, then the drive to succeed in the magic corporate world wanes. In my neck of the woods, I routinely see young people (perhaps 20-25) driving very expensive cars, these same people will have very expensive phones, clothes and anything else fashionable. I know why this is. And I don’t want it – and for that I am grateful as the ability to make do with far less is something I have always admired.

I’ve experienced this in microcosm on expat assignments where I carry a disproportionate amount of the load.

                        Why my husband and I only rarely attend the company Christmas party.  Hubby is their big time earner, but he can’t talk to any of the other office guys openly, and the increasingly far-flung other company drones include increasing lashings of mystery meat.  We prefer our own company.

                    Interesting when you think of how corporate life is portrayed  – has always been portrayed, really.  My friend’s ex-British army husband used to dream of the American corporate life.  Now that he’s lived it for a few decades, he’s just as desperate for them to offer him an early retirement and GTFO.  Of course, the corporate life he dreamed of wasn’t run by pajeets.

                True, a person raised in a traditional home and raised with a work ethic needs little supervision for his or her  manager to look like a genius. On the other hand white people raised with unrealistic expectations mixed in with lazy joggers all managed by HR type managers does not create a innovative and productive workplace for our new business world.

                    I am not sure when, but I think that most first world economies have shifted from ‘maximum production’ as their mantra to ‘maximum employment’; and there is plenty of make-work to go around.

                    Part of the difficulty is a lack of overall competence in supporting and entry roles. Many supervisors aren’t intelligent enough to explain things concisely and many workers lack initiative and sense of personal freedom to give something a shot. The method of “watch me to it and then you try it” gets substituted for “attend 5 seminars after which you’ll get the check mark for your box that tells us you’re qualified even though you haven’t done this job yet”. The response is to hyper-structure tasks and systems with a 6 gorillion step checklist that appeals to the feminine.I had a manager a couple years ago who would give hr + “trainings” where she’d just monologue around in circles the entire time. If someone had made a mistake she’d spend the entire time talking at that person; everyone just had to sit there. It was such a colossal waste of time. She didn’t have great time mgmt anyway but ended up full of resentment for the enormous time blocks the trainings took just b/c she was too stupid to explain smthg briefly, and acted like those monologues were a huge favor to us. Ah, what a nightmare. Made up my mind never to work for a woman again.

                        Also need to consider the level of competence and intelligence of those being trained.  My younger kid is a reliable and willing worker, but he’s just not that bright.  Something that seems intuitive to others needs to be explained to him (i.e. scan all items in the same warehouse location together instead of following how things are listed on the scanner and running back and forth).

Hit the nail on the head there. The sense of personal freedom, what it means to have such a responsibility, as well as the steps needed to keep it are lost on the youth. And in fact, as COVID shows, most people in general.

            Slightly off-topic, but in my experience a lot of Boomers are simply refusing to retire, which is blocking Xers and Millenials from taking that next step up the ladder.

                That observation, from my experience, is somewhat true but works this way: Boomer refuses to retire until past his expiry date, and the Gen Xers are passed over for a Millennial. It truly is a transition from mediocre to shiftless. Gen Xers had better learn and learn fast they have to go out on their own if that even is possible.

            I’m an early boomer and remember very well life in the 1950s. Say what you will of that era, it looked a lot like what the people commenting here seem to want. Family life was still the centerpiece of society. The fuliginous population was segregated, controlled and reasonably well behaved. Christian morality, if not always followed, set the standard for behavior. Manliness was virtuous, not toxic. Women were feminine in the best sense of that word. Businesses were contributing participants in the communities where they operated. Workers produced real things of value and hadn’t been transformed into ciphers in cubicles staring at computer screens. The entertainment industry did not insult or annoy its audience. Education supported freedom of thought and celebrated Western culture.If, as I read here, such times can never come again, I wonder what the dissident right intends future society to look like.

                Your mom sounds like a nice lady. Tell her for me, that I thought the ” Cuban guy” talking about his escape from Castros Communist hell and coming to the land of opportunity to seek a better life was touching as well.

JBlake is not going to get the pop Fentanyl Floyd did because they have already released (or failed to suppress) the portion of the video showing him acting like a fool when the police arrived.

        Regarding nostalgia, I’ve had this discussion with others.Are there any new ideas in the movie industry, or just reboots of things from past generations?  The biggest hits in recent years are reboots of Star Wars, Jurassic Park, etc.  Hell, they’re even rebooting Bill &amp; Ted.When movies like Star Wars or Jurassic Park first arrived on the scene, they were new, innovative, different, a step forward in technology and storytelling.  Now we just reboot those old things, usually as a pale imitation with more CGI.Could you imagine filmmakers in the 1970s rebooting stuff from the 30s or 40s?  It would never happen.Just another example of a bankrupt popular culture which has run out of ideas and is nearing a dead end.

            New ideas? Retrofuturism? The recycling of the recycling?Partof the trouble is the industry has become increasingly geared towards a more low-common-denominator global audience.But I think a larger part of it has to do with the fact that artistic expression, at least in the west, stalled out in the 1990s and has now come to a complete halt.Why is this?This guy whose book I have linked to below had some pretty good insights.He was a Marxist (real, not cultural), a Joy Division fan, and a suicide (2017).I first read this essay a decade ago right after it came out, and then again after listening to Borzoi and his crew talk about it a few weeks ago. It’s thin in pages but thick with ideas.Since we’re going to go a couple of weeks sans Power Hour, it might be worth a look.https://ia801009.us.archive.org/20/items/capitalistrealism/Capitalist-Realism-Is-There-no-Alternative-.pdf

        Antifa/BLM gets blamed and BLAM-ed. Unless I misread the news account, a 17-year-old protecting property in Kenosha killed two, presumably Antifa types. His trial will be interesting; absent exceptional proof of his being the initiator, speaking personally I would have a hard time convicting him. While it would be the last thing on Earth for me to condone such violence  😎  I imagine such incidents will give many Radicals pause and ask if breaking windows and burning stuff is really worth the risk. Or it may escalate things, who knows. I say “Bring it on.”Washington, D.C. no violence, merely obnoxious Liberals ruining the dining experience of peaceful Liberals. Diners were asked, nay, ordered, to raise their fists to prove support of The Revolution. Now, here’s my take: sure, in DC the vast majority of people are left-liberal. But this in an in-your-face example of the threats &amp; intimidation , out-of-control faction that Z often mentions. A red pill for those who desperately need it. “You know, Bob, I’ve been thinking, and perhaps there are limits to this Progressive thing…” Or, perhaps it’ll just get filed somewhere in Denial Aisle next to the “Whites are responsible for all Black shortcomings” filing cabinet. But we are now beyond mere racial factions: These two incidents drive home the fact that many (most?) of the Antifa/BLM militants are white proto-communists.

        Z Man said: “Some argue that the Civil War was a second founding of the nation, a rework of the first, but repairing the flaws in the original founding. This would then be the birth of the revolutionary America, the genuinely revolutionary America, that exists today.”I’ve never been a big Abraham Lincoln worshiper. There were good reasons people in the south called him a tyrant. I recently read an article on a site called The Warden Post  about a book intitled: “The Basic Symbols of the American Political Tradition.” The authors contend that, in fact there was a second founding of the republic but not under the same principles as the founding fathers had used. The original princaples were about consensual self-government and Christian traditions. The new republic was founded on princaples found in the Declaration of Independence such as “equality” and “rights”  It’s a good read.” How Lincoln destroyed America using the Declaration of Independence.”http://thewardenpost.net/how-lincoln-destroyed-america-using-the-declaration-of-independence/

            Lincoln was a corrupt monster installed by railroad barons.  He’s only revered today because the Republican establishment from 1970-1920 carefully reconstructed his image as emancipating deity, complete with Lincoln Memorial (now there’s something we can get behind tearing down).  The country that emerged after him was entirely different, with all pretense to liberty taking a back seat to top down corporatist management.

        What’s interesting about American history is that there’s this direct line of busy bodies going all the way back to the founding.  The same busy bodies that are causing trouble today.  They almost always get their way, but I think it’s different today precisely because it’s now a different county (literally, with a changed out population) than it was even in 1960.  The founders, even the Anglicans, were very reformed in their outlook.  They weren’t “building the kingdom.”  They were trying to live, in peace, in a dangerous unforgiving world full of human scum.  Then the Methodists came along and ruined everything.  From the 1820s on it was “we’re building heaven on earth here, pour that liquor down the drain, close down that plantation, make women politicians…etc.”  By the Progressive era they jettisoned religion altogether and became secular preachers, with religion as an accomplice.  Ultimately this was a white yankee Protestant project got out of control and went terribly wrong.  The wokeness is their last beachhead before the bankruptcy and dissolution of the country.

        The Revolution is like a hydra, popping a head up in this country or that whenever the opportunity arises, sometimes for a good while and other times just a peek to test the waters. The global conditions are fertile ground for it, and there is no sign those conditions are changing anytime soon.That isnt to black pill, it is possible that like an addict humanity just needs to hit rock bottom is all. It isnt pretty in the gutter but sometimes thats the only way up.I like to think that in the meantime the Revolution can end at least in my home. Raising my children to be morally secure in their beliefs and immune to the world’s, developing my family’s spirituality, and avoiding even the near occasion to…lets say be degenerate. Anyone can stop abusing substances, work on their physical fitness, and help keep themselves and those within their circle close to the classical virtues even in small ways. In other words Tradition, which by Zman’s definition above is the exact inverse of Revolution.Most of us, like me, arent influencers so maybe that is the best we can do for now: kill the Revolution in our own sphere of influence. It is the principle of subsidiarity – before we can complain about the lack of a coherent dissident movement, we should be that movement in whatever way we can be in our own lives.Btw did anyone else see that shooting out of Kenosha? That was wild. The third guy who ran up to get shot after he saw the first two get a bullet just goes to show these people have some form of brain damage that doesnt properly weigh threats in their environment or something cos theres no other way youd charge a rifleman like that otherwise. I doubt it was just bravery. The video of him screaming like a woman after he gets shot in the arm is telling.

                “Disenfranchisements were made”. Sincerely, Boomer.Boomer hate is lazy, but kind of fun and cathartic too.As a cynical x’er I am prone to generational hate. Moments of weakness. But its nothing personal. And it comes from a good place: I just want the boomers to be better. Its tough love.Which is only fair as they want me to shut up, pay taxes, subsidize their pharma, and buy them out of the ponzi before the reaper rides in on AOC.We’ll just call it a push.Look on the bright side. Maybe those boys are just not who we are.Maybe the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin. Maybe many of those millennial white boys, if they survive, will inherit all that boomer wealth, if it survives, and then they can finally assume their place in the franchise next to Arjun, Nkembe, Yun, and Juan pedro III. You know, Who we are. And then our Democracy will be saved.

All those natural conservatives like Arjun, Nkembe, Yun &amp; Juan Pedro III have just been temporarily derailed by the evil leftists currently controlling our awesome nation.  As soon as we can offer them a “greater society” deal, they’ll be back on the conservative USA surfboard, no questions asked. Then we’ll be the big multi-culti smorgasbord we’ve all dreamed of.

        Z: “Something similar is happening on the Left. The stuff we are seeing with left-wing agitation and rioting is like a weird cargo cult. They are reenactors playing roles they heard their grandparents talk about at family gatherings. Those behind it are trying to conjure a familiar bogeyman from the past. They desperately want Bull Connor to show up with fire-hoses and attack dogs. They’ll settle for idiots in homemade armor, just so they can pretend it is yesterday.”

        oh and it was good to see young Sandmann doing alright and remaining faithful. it was also good that his truth was clearly revealed. thankfully y’all north american whites have much less annoying natives to deal with; then again, too many north sea descendants wanting to be cucks too. it’s hard, but maybe converting would help. Rome did unite whites before.
also, young Sandmann does seem to have a certain cool haircut.

        A peek into our future:James Beard restaurant awards cancelled.From NYT:“As Black Lives Matters protests bloomed across the country, patience was growing thin over how few opportunities are given to Black chefs, including the opportunity to win Beard awards…At an emergency meeting…a foundation staff member who had seen the final voting results raised a second concern: No Black people had won in any of the 23 categories on the ballot…(Much snitching ensues to get whites removed from nominee list – Frip)The ballot would be edited to remove nominees the foundation now saw as problematic. But as summer went on, that list kept getting longer. “The longer they waited, the more they learned about people,” another committee member said.One nominated chef said that a Beard rep called two weeks ago to communicate a charge that was both anonymous and nebulous: “toxic kitchen culture.” “I said, ‘Can you give me an example?’ She said, ‘That’s it. Toxic kitchen culture.”The foundation has said it is taking a year to work with all seven of its awards committees and “an outside social justice agency” to settle on new ground rules.”https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Behind-the-Cancellation-of-James-Beard-Awards-15514748.php

                It’s happening to New York theatre too. Musicals and plays. It’s a plus for us because restaurant and theatre problems directly perturb their liberal sophisticate patrons. They’ll see first hand how communism/BLM ruins things. This hits home. It’s the equivalent of riots coming to their own neighborhoods.Another factor is, much of the two industries are full of bitchy gay men who shake with rage over non-meritted advantage. People in both professions work extremely hard and are driven almost solely by credit and accolades. This shit ain’t gonna fly in those quarters.Look what happened to La La Land at the 2016 Oscars. A brilliant modern musical lost to, basically, a black home movie. LOL

        yes, the radicals knew that without endless senseless revolution (what else can be more senseless but abolishing all incentive to produce the wealth you need to redistribute, yet invent all sorts of control and propaganda to keep slaves hacking away anyway – to build Kalashnikovs and not much else), endless empire couldn’t exist. which is why without them radicals, the only eternal institutions that can guarantee Russian unity are those that defend the faith and traditions that keep Russian genos and ethnos together. true, it may mean losing some of the minorities, but at least Russia can grow more organically from its base territory; so now it can get Crimea and maybe the Russian-friendly part of the Ukraine. no, i don’t believe in Orthodox stasis, but rather Catholic organic development, not endless secular revolution – else you risk not surviving the guillotines and fires. ask the Kenosha kid that’s getting the strapon collar brought to the formerly white as snow Wisconsin suburbs – so gotta keep the funny clothes in the closet, just in case even the white strongholds of Lagos are stormed by the flood…

        The O.G. modernist revolutionary was Martin Luther.  We are living on reverberations from that singular protesting event fracturing western Christianity into countless versions.  Once “reasoned” the vice sin into a virtuous deed (and other distortions of dogma) the floodwaters of hell were released.“love God and sin boldly” is one of the phrases tagged to him.

        Not sure why the author and comments don’t see the demographic future of America as an explanation for why we see Trump and RNC pandering to diverse people. It should be obvious that we will be the minority, and an all white Team Republican has no chance of winning without using conservative minded others to vote R.

                The name of the game is to win the election. You ducked that. Play the cards you are dealt. Reality is a bitch. Find ways to make non-whites to share and live the same values. Yet, the whining about the Republican Party not suiciding itself is inexplicable.

                        Sad to say, but demographics is destiny. How big is the base? How long until that white base becomes inert? Expand a value base that agrees with the founding. Then you can keep your guns, and take on the swamp, it’s corruption, and return the dream called America. “They ain’t white” should not matter. I’ve seen it.

                    I don’t blame ppl who work in the Republican party for wanting to win. You never win by copying the other guy. An explicitly white message would pull way more non-whites than pandering does.
Trump’s message to Latinos and Asians should be, “You came here to live in a white, organized, law-abiding country” and then showcase black rioting, and the caravan’d hordes.

                        Why do you need the word, “white?” Values make a friendship, not skin color or country of origin. Remember it was “ Keep those filthy Dagos and Micks out of our country.”  Even though I make this message, it does not mean that I believe in allowing illegal immigration, or an immigration program that does not fully assimilate immigrants. The old system called the melting pot seem to be working just fine, and that to me wasn’t the problem that got us here today as much As economic and political subterfuge beginning in about 1913.

                                It’s a nice thought, but not going to work. The Irish and Italians assimilated, and they were willing and capable of doing so. That’s not going to happen now and the future is a bitter multiethnic society. Think Austro-Hungarian empire.

                        Certainly you cannot. That’s why we need to have things in common about freedom and liberty and culture with humans who are already here or who will be coming here and who will vote like us. We can circle the wagons and say whites only or you must be like whites and surely we will lose.

                            you must be like whitesBe like Whites/Anglos is exactly what my Italian grandparents were told, and the America that accepted them had every right to tell them that and/or to not accept them at all.My Dad wasn’t allowed to speak Italian at home from the time he started school. Everything had to be in English. They raised him to be a White American, not an Italian. If my grandparents hadn’t been willing to be like Whites/Anglos, then it would have been right for them to leave, like about a third of immigrants during that period (turn of the century immigration wave) did. No welfare. No talking up the marvelous benefits of multi-culturalism, it was “speak English, fit in and earn a living or get out.”Then we had an immigration moratorium for about 45-50 years and most of those ethnic groups became so dilute in the Anglo population that you really can’t tell them apart in most cases. I know a lot of Italians who are in an ethnic sense still proud to think of themselves as Italians, but not a one who’d fly the Italian flag in preference to the US flag, as many Mexicans do.The post 1965 immigration wave has been wholly different. We’ve fetishized peoples’ home cultures, made “act like Whites” an act of “racism,” imported people who are far, far from the Anglo norm and have difficulty fitting in, and subsidized their failure to fit in with endless state subsidies.I’ve got personal, bitter experience with Mexican men who got American women pregnant then fled the country. They don’t want to be Americans. They just wanted some money to send home.Lastly, we are no longer a frontier nation trying to fill empty spaces. We don’t need immigrants anymore. We need assimilation from the ones we have and we need those who refuse to assimilate with Anglo culture to leave.Lastly, we need to stop pretending that the former slave population is assimilatable. They’re 13% of the population that commits 55% of the murders, forever with their hands out, forever ungrateful for the vast web of preferential treatment we’ve built up over the past 60 years to try to drag them into civilization. I refuse to be lectured about my privilege by some angry African American studies professor who came from a middle class home, got accepted to a college above her ability by affirmative action and coddled along and handed a professorship that shouldn’t even exist in a world where academic excellence still existed. I don’t care about Thomas Sowell, Clarence Thomas and Walter Williams. They are statistical anomalies and you can’t base national policy on statistical anomalies.You want to judge people by their character, but not the color of their skin, I assume, but what would you mean by that? Does that mean that we can take the whole Section 8 population and ship them out, because they are demonstrating a marked lack of character? Can we stop giving credence to complaints about disproportionate incarceration of Black men, because their lack of character leads them to commit disproportionate amounts of crime? Can we stop affirmative action and stop giving time to resulting complaints about lack of black representation at universities, because their characters and their IQs are not up to college standards?When can we do some of that character judging? Because I can tell you the racially and ethnically cohesive groups that will suffer from being judged by their character won’t let you make that policy now that the media, corporate America and the Democratic party are all in for BLM and POC.

                                Good comment, similar ethnic background here, and I agree pretty much with everything written. You forgot some thing about earlier generations and more current ones: more current generations have been kept on the Democrat party plantation and the whole culture has been slowly destroyed since the 1930s by cultural Marxism through that gift to America Known as the Frankfurt school. People here are forgetting that and they see non-whites as being incorrigible but they never stood a chance to become Americans since the decay brought on by Hegelian ideas that have helped the left control the narratives. And control everything else. I would invite you to google search unconstrained analytics And read all 255 pages.

                                    Yet more projection.  There’s no one here (who’s been here for more than a day or two like yourself) who isn’t well aware of the Frankfurt school.  This isn’t ‘communism vs. freedumb 101.’  You are utterly ignoring the role of genetics and race in formation of character, both individual and group, as well as sheernumbers.  So you go form your multikult civnat paradise and show up all the notsees here.

                                        Pure gibberish and, again, a losing proposition for the here and now. You give little to no credit to the type of government and economic system that we inherited. If you could possibly remove the fly from the ointment you would see all talk of race evaporate—by your type and the other side (BLM, etc).  I submit to you that people care more about financial and physical security than race, and race is the purposeful divider employed by evil and greedy psychopaths, and you have sadly fallen into that trap; so you will never try to lead people to the truth. You, like the manipulated “vibrant” think it’s all about race. Lay in that bed if you like, but I really don’t look forward to the oncoming war. We will be fighting the wrong enemy.

                                    And that — giving non-Whites a chance — would be great, if this were still 1965 or 1970 and there was still time and demographic dominance to turn things around. But there’s not. That window has passed.In the case of hispanics, there are too many of them, too insulated, too allied with self-destructive White leftists, blacks and asian interest groups trying to get a piece of what Whitey has.The high Spanish Central and South Americans are more or less White people and would be just fine, if we hadn’t allowed them to overwhelm us and hadn’t treated them like an oppressed minority with all the benefits that come with that. The mestizo, mostly native little “hispanics” are basically a variety of American Indian with all the pathologies that go along with that. They haven’t done a good job of assimilating because they can’t. They drag down every society they’re a part of. They’re why South and Central America are like they are.In the case of Blacks, there is ample evidence that it just ain’t happening. We are a fundamentally different people, biologically. Living together is a disaster. They have zero to gain by acquiescing to a merit-based society.Asians can assimilate, but like the high Spanish Central and South Americans, the Diversity, Inclusion and Equity scam is just too good for them. They are very down with the idea of using racial and ethnic unity to promote their interests over Whites (Mark my words, the Asian battle with Ivy League admissions won’t help native Whites even one little bit). A high IQ outgroup on the rise in your country is never a good thing for the heritage population. Ask the American Indians. Ask Indonesians and Filipinos about the Chinese.Biology is real. And we’re at the wrong side of a wave of incompatible biology. We waited too long. We should be thinking like Serbs or Croats, wanting to carve out a nation of our own, but Euro Whites aren’t there yet. A lot of them (you) still think we can keep our whole country from sea to sea, but that’s just no longer realistically possible.

                                        The election, if we know the true numbers of those who voted for Trump, will prove one of us correct. Our immigration system and all local politics have been greatly distorted and skewed away from assimilating immigrants from any nation to first becoming American and holding American values, and second from being able through assimilating to improve their lot in life, which would have the effect of freeing them from the permanent underclass that the Democrats have in mind, And thereby creating potentially new Republican voters. Success had a way of making successful immigrants a little bit more likely to vote in their financial and conservative interests. So, you may be right, but only because the damage has been done and the Poison has been dripping for a long time, which makes it virtually impossible to transform people who work hard, Wherever they come from, into becoming conservative voters.

Yeah, Sarah Jeong, the Korean immigrant hired to the editorial board of the New York Times and who thinks Whites are “goblins who should live underground,” she obviously didn’t have to assimilate any American values and they weren’t necessary for improving her lot in life. Do you think more success would make her a little more likely to be conservative? I don’t know what more we can do for her, though, aside from elect her President.
I think that’s Ilhan Omar’s problem, too. Too downtrodden and unsuccessful.

                        You certainly cannot vote your way out of this mess by excluding others who wish to share our values. It is that simple. If you immigrated to this country and we’re at first a democrat because they promised a helping hand, but you worked hard and became successful, use in time may become a Republican and share values that we all seem to hold. Why turned them off and make them think we’re all a bunch of insulated xenophobes? We are at 60% and shrinking. I get more pissed off at my parents generation and the early part of the baby boom buying into Paul Ehrlich‘s insane theories, while Pope Paul the sixth was telling everybody not to use contraception. Nobody listened.Sorry for the way this was transcribed but trying to edit on a cell phone on this particular comment venue is frustrating.

                            I feel like I’m reading something out of 1965.Retired, you might be more convincing if you could point to any place or time in world history where becoming a minority in their own country has worked out well for the heritage population, and where the heritage population has been able to talk the invaders into adopting the heritage values.And I’ll just stop you right there, before you tell me about early waves of European immigration to the US, because they were A) very brief compared to the current waves, B) from countries that were part of the same European Renaissance/Enlightenment culture as the heritage Americans, C) Were the same race and close to the same religion (and instances where they were not, the problems have been particularly acute), D) Actually caused a ton of harm to the nation via organized crime, political corruption, Marxist/progressive politics, etc. and can’t be regarded in anyway as an unqualified success, and E) Never constituted a majority.So, pick someplace that’s not the United States.

We depopulated ourselves, globalist forces piled on to replace us.
Preach the Gospel, or at least the American gospel. What choice do we have? Run on xenophobia? Race? … and lose. Or, work for a new unity.
Don’t know what winning formula the DR has, and objecting and nostalgia isn’t a winner.
Ethnostates? Fine but it won’t happen.

I see no evidence that ethnostates won’t happen. They happened throughout Eastern Europe when the Soviet Union fell. When the American Empire falls, and it will, I see no reason why the same thing won’t happen.

                                        Yes, it may happen, but we are talking here about how to win an election; the idea of white ethnosates will appeal to how many millions of people? And you better put your shooting earmuffs on because you’ll want to drown out all of the laughter by the Commies who are rubbing their hands together if the RNC were to campaign on white, white, white.

                                            but we are talking here about how to win an electionAre we? A core part of the Zman’s message is that electoral politics are a waste of the DR’s time.you’ll want to drown out all of the laughter by the Commies who are rubbing their hands together if the RNC were to campaign on white, white, white.Oh, no! Not that! I want to be a good conservative and lose with the respectful approval of the commies, like we usually do!The point isn’t to campaign at all. What part of “we are not voting our way out of this” is hard to understand?I think you’ll find that while a lot people here talk about the pros and cons of Trump vs. Biden and electoral politics, most are just looking at which path eases us most effectively and safely to the point where enough Whites realize electoral politics is a dead end.Neither President Harris nor President Rubio, nor anyone else in the presidential pipeline, no less Congress and the Judiciary, is really interested in judging people on the content of their character rather than the color of their skin because the burgeoning minority-majority absolutelydoes not wantto be judged based on their character, or heaven forbid their merit, because the outcome wouldn’t be good for them.

                                                No. Trump—besides being undermined by the Deep State,  the FBI, the intelligence agencies, the DOJ, the MSM, etc.—had to fight off the cream of the scum in the Republican Party such as McCain, Corker, Romney, Flake and plenty of others. I hope for Trump to come into his own during the next four years.

                                        No, I cannot cite examples because those states were not organized by a document that could handle factions—you know, all of that stuff in The Federalist Papers.
Leftists looked for and found ways to destroy the Constitution and the rule of law.

                                            I think the idea that our founding documents could handle factions has been proven conclusively false. Factions were one of Madison’s greatest fears and the document he penned wasn’t up to the task of constraining them.

My Civ Nat friends talk Trump tough but they won’t cut the cord, so they stupidly contribute to the Left’s war chest.
The Constitution didn’t fail. Who, or what failed? “It’s them non-whites! That’s the problem!”  Huh? They are pawns!

                                    Interesting point. If an ethnostate is unrealizable, what SHOULD we be aiming for? I’d think an improved on version of brazil would be the best hope. How to improve it?


Probably people should be thinking in terms of managing those less than dreamy contingencies, I expect that’s what the ruling class is aiming for (read: that’s probably what will actually happen).

                                        First, if we do not try to forge a broader conservative base, and you know what I mean by broader, then Balkanization May result. Perhaps Trump is the perfect leader to make “the others” take a look at America as we saw it.Second, Many of the commenters here did not know how to answer my question, which was what do you do to solve the problem?  Mr Smith had to cite Z Mans passive etnothstate—while quietly recruiting. Why is it that so few people here failed to simplyState that? And what are they doing to recruit guys like me, who completely sides with White interests and especially white lives that are in such peril right now?I noticed all of the cheap shots about Breitbart readers, and a slew of other people and groups—People and groups who are white conservative but are tainted by this dreaded disease known as Civ Nat—And I had to just Shake my head at the obvious lack of real serious attempt at recruiting people to their cause. The only reason why I don’t make angry comments to the replies that I receive is because I realize we are all alike in many ways but I wear the tag of being a Normie or a civic nationalist. The few people who engage in a conversation with me have Earned my respect and admiration. For me this thing called ethno state may become a reality but it is not something that I have surrendered to, yet. If we cannot save America Then that will be the default.I ask people, assume that we attempt a separation. What chance would any separatist movement have in a country that is run by Black Lives Matter Marxists? At first glance, the answer I expect is that we would annihilate them. But annihilate who? Certainly not the military. The military controlled by a Marxist government would not abide by the rules of the constitution and posse comitatus.perhaps you could tell me about Brazil, as I have had my hands full with trying to survive and prepare for the worst. So I know very little about Brazilian politics. Please note that the grammar in this post is poor due to using a cell phone. Sorry.

He’s living in his bubble and won’t be dissuaded by facts or history.  Millions just like him.  They’re lost, and we can’t risk ourselves to try to persuade or save them.

The idea is asserted to be theonlysolution to the “large society problem.” It is a brilliant insight by Zman. Read the linked post by him, and then read the essay that he links to about the large society problem.

                                            Absurd to suggest that Retired is a normie, if you mention a white ethnostate to a REAL normie he either 1) is totally unaware of demographics and thinks we already have one indefinitely or 2) recoils in horror and starts rocking back and forth mumbling the comfort word “RACIST!”Retired seems to want the same ideal situation but simply see it as unforeseeable.  That’s a radically different thing.I might add he’s also way ahead of a lot of full 1488 blackpillers who want nothing less than a 100% ethnostate from sea to sea… but also think it’s impossible.  Only THEIR solution is every many for himself eating MREs and (millions of whites?) hiding from globoschlomo in the woods.We’ve got what, 10% of the white population generally sympathetic?  Happily slicing people out of that for any deviationism is maybe not the wisest course.

Racial solidarity has limits.  I love my people and I want them to flourish in their own lands… but I don’t want to be guillotined by jacobins or starved by stalin any more than I want to be macheted by hutus or sacrificed to Quetzalcoatl.

                                        And how long will your withdrawn community last when the Bolsheviks take over. So you would never team up with a black guy even if he agreed with your values and votes no on tyranny? Cut off your nose to spite your face?Further, you and the gal that you replied to think this is your own private venue. Those damn natives thought so too once upon a time, but we took the land, so that argument is puerile. I have read here for years, made a comment about winning, and Z’s chorus all decided they didn’t like winning and would rather fight a military campaign against a full on Democrat FedGov than to believe that minorities might save the day if they, too, want freedom and liberty instead of what is being promised in blue cities.Being here longer hardly proves that you are right or enlightened.

                                I love how this is always thrown out. It’s simultaneously a false equivalence (all immigrants are equivalent), and a false dichotomy (Southern European Whites were extremely different from Nothern European Whites.)They were indeed different, but there are degrees of different. The cultures that brought us Plato and Michelangelo have a lot more in common with the culture of Locke and Luther than they have different. We had literally millennia of civilizational integration in Europe going for us.As I mentioned in another post, the ways that they were different did indeed cause major problems.But Southern Europeans are orders of magnitude more like Northern Europeans than Sub-Saharan Africans, Orientals and Central and South American Natives.

                                    I could go down this road but it isn’t important.
What do you think about white crime, poverty, and drug abuse in rural areas? I moved where it is almost all white and was surprised by what I have learned.
We should focus on good vs evil rather than race and ethnicity, if it’s not too late. Evil has exacerbated race and ethnicity as causes.

                        So, you mean to tell me that a shrinking white population with an all white message is really going to carry the day? You also conveniently lumped together all Mexicans and Muslims when certainly there are those who already are on our side. Do I need to tell you the names of Muslim authors who are attacking radical Islam?You guys are so quick to use the term Civ Nat and all kinds of other derisive terms just to live in a stupid bubble. We cannot turn back the clock to win the country was 70% or more white.

                                        All white enclaves have white Marxists and Karen’s.  Population growth strangely translates to government and regulatory growth.  White enclaves would have to keep people out. Feds under Biden puppeteers will air drop Syrians, etc. See Minnesota. You make lots of good comments. This isn’t one of them.
What problem would you have if your nonwhite neighbors played golf, shot skeet, went to church, and voted like you and with you?

                                                        She was wrong.  In fact, she is the Left’s modern matriarch.  Abortion for thee you black, Hispanic, and Italian scum, but not for us!Is that it?Ah, the Muslims love this as they wait in the wings pumping out more babies and probably don’t believe in abortion.Now, surely you have spotted a chink in my argument since I mentioned Muslims. In the end, they will be a much bigger threat to us than others that we have talked about. If some vote for Trump, I will take it; but those may end up turning from Islam. Good go towards the light.

What are the odds that if you go to Portland or Seattle or Chicago that you’re not gonna get smacked upside the head by some lunatic white kid? You see where I’m getting at? You have to understand that if you believe in God you do believe that it is possible for people of any skin color to identify with the good.

You side only with whites and refuse to believe that people of other races religions or homelands could not possibly have similar values with regard to how we should be governed. That is just completely lame. Furthermore, taking your statement that I should side with my people, that confuses me. I don’t know if you mean I should go out and fire bomb buildings with white punks or not. I don’t know if I should become a male Karen and Yep at people for not wearing a mask. Is that what you want me to do? Certainly that’s not what you want me to do but yet you want me to side with white people, many of whom are jackasses.You would be helping yourself if you said you need to side with like minded people with good values that are pro American, decent and humble, but warriors against evil.

                                                “And race trumps muh principles every time.”
EVERY time?  So we’re going to go ahead and say in the french revolution (to take an egregious and particularly important example) race trumped principles and it worked out great given a homogeneous population?
C’mon man!
Can we insist that race is important to the “Race doesn’t exist” crowd without drunkenly falling off the other side of the wall and landing onto ONLY race is important?

                                                    I live in poor, rural Appalachia. The people out here are largely fine people, abandoned by elites that shut down their mines and moved all their factories overseas.
Appalachia is the poorest part of the US but has a crime rate below the national average.

                                                        Probably. I’ve noticed that we praise our own without saying anything about the multiple marriages and divorce. It really gets confusing when they try to tell me about their family. Glad you moved there: they can shoot distance and live off the land—family idiosyncrasies aside.

                                            What problem would you have if your nonwhite neighbors played golf, shot skeet, went to church, and voted like you and with you?The problem I would have is that they are not my people. That doesn’t make them bad. It just makes them not my people.I’ve worked for a couple multi-national corporations, traveled all over the world. Everywhere I go, every time a lot of people of different races and cultures gather together, know what happens? They gravitate to their little groups.I’m that guy that would often sit down at the table with the APAC (Asia-Pacific) guys at lunch, just for a change. And we’d have a nice little chat for a while. Then, inevitably, the conversation would drift back to Chinese, Japanese, Hindi or whatever the dominant language was, and there I’d be, alone at a crowded table.In companies where there were Chinese or Indians who moved up into executive ranks, you’d see them hiring more Chinese and Indians under them — because they feel comfortable about Chinese and Indians. Even the guys who spoke English nearly like natives, their lives were just different. Their religious holidays were different, their diets were different, their pastimes were different. Not bad, just different. Not my people.I don’t have to justify why I like being around my own people any more than they do.I want to live in a country where my kids and grandkids grow up with their own people. I like American culture. I don’t want to live in a world where I have to see an obligatory apology before watchingThe Magnificent Sevendue to unflattering portrayals of Mexican culture and appropriation of Mexican roles by non-Mexican actors.I don’t want to live in a country whereGone With The Windis a hate crime.I don’t want to live in a world where every TV show, every movie, every advertisement has to be parsed for proper racial, gender and ethnic representation. I like mostly White people in my entertainment. I want the exotic to stay exotic.I don’t have to have a rational, logical explanation for that.

                                                Fine. But why the outcry over watching blacks possibly tipping the election to Trump? Winning this election is the last chance. If we do win and justice can be meted out to the Russia crowd and to those who have rioted and killed innocent citizens, we can reverse course. If nothing like that comes from a Trump victory, then more than whites will suffer.

                                            You may not consider that a good comment but it is what I would do. It is a direct response to what you asked. I live in a White enclave without a Marxist among the people around me. It isn’t hard to do.Incidentally, I am voting for Trump and hope he wins. That’s not because I think he will do anything substantive but because the State will not accept his re-election and will set off what has to happen to preserve our people. With any luck, it will involve a secession of the city-states from the rest of us and be peaceful.

Just interested whether you will Ghost Dance harder to bring back the Constitution or if you will respond substantively. People need to think hard and long about it.

I do not know how it will play out, so presently I plan on defending property and life, then town/neighbors and state. If military comes then it would be surrender or suicide-by-mil. Our sheriff is on our side and that should not change so I don’t see having to surrender weapon or suicide by cop. If your scenario happens, the gig is up. Of course Civ Nat is dead too then. How does a passive ethnostate built on rights accomplish anything then?Never could visualize what Mr. Z was describing on that topic.

                                        Let’s play soros’ advocate for a minute…


So the plan is:


1) self marginalize from power, self ghettoize, make shrinking minority group noxious and unhelpful to existing power structures

2) ???

3) White ethnostate!


Hmm… I’m not opposed to your step 3 but what’s step 2 supposed to be? Because if you don’t know step 2, your step 1 seems to be headed toward something else entirely

                                    Please tell me how your solution is going to work this time when it has failed since at least the 1990’s.
Minority outreach, particularly with Hispanics, has been a staple of GOP strategy since HW.
To reach these voters the GOP is lurching ever leftward along with the country itself.
Your “solution” is suicide.  More anti-White garbage, more Progressive values.

                                        Traditional solutions haven’t worked because the Left has made them impossible to work and they have divided in order to conquer. How is it anti-white progressive reaching if blacks, browns, and others say they have had enough of the globalist uniparty robs them while putting them and their loved ones in danger? What if they join us and give Trump a huge mandate? It buys time and throws sand into the gears of the uniparty. We will see, but if they don’t think like you or I it may be due to 50, or more years of Democrat power seeking divisiveness and not tribalism, which itself has been the endgame by our “betters” who have been at this for a long time.You are a thinker. Read about root causes and understand.“Unconstrained Analytics” is the best I can offer. PDF free online.Not sure what your solutions are.If Trump wins or loses, there will be war.  Depending on which side wins, people will be hanged. Ask “the force” (I will pray) that the good wins.

Remember the Kulaks?Why don’t you welcome seeing black men and women standing up to and exposing Biden and the Democrats? Doesn’t it make you think that they believe in American ideals? Does it give you hope that they might be BECOMING more white—which people here, today, said they expect from non-whites? Or, is your mind set on the notion that you are better? Smarter? More deserving?— so no thank you, don’t do me any favors by voting for Trump.Yes, for now, for me, CN will have to do. And the author does say “recruit along the way,” I believe.when was the last time that 100% of 60% voted Republican?When you went to college, before the 90s let’s say, your professors certainly taught you that for a Republican presidential candidate to win, he needed to garner Democrats switch votes and independents. That hasn’t changed. Trump will not get 100% of the white vote. Do the math, pray that we can turn this thing around Politically, or be prepared for your worst nightmare.

Absolutely correct. That’s why they say we can’t vote our way out of this. Eventually it will go beyond the ballot box and white Americans will either have to bend the knee to whatever minority becomes dominant or maintain themselves through the shedding of blood. In the meantime political activity should orient toward whites cohering in a self-conscious group with own interests.

Sell America and assimilate properly. A long moratorium on new immigration would be nice.

                                    Plan: build white communities, have children. Teach them well.The future belongs to those who show up to use Z Man’s pithy phrase. At the end of the day that Indian friend won’t cross his people. He knows his kinsmen won’t tolerate any nonsense, but whites tolerate all kind of nonsense. You can’t respect a person or group who is so permissive. Neither can they respect themselves.It’d be nice to form alliances of convenience with other ethnic groups, but we can only do so from a position of strength when you have ethnic solidarity. The point of the matter isn’t to take a negative position toward other groups, but to recognize the reality of our own extended ethnic family and take responsibility for each other. When we achieve this we can deal with other groups more realistically.

                            A lot of mexicans ARE white.  Sailer remarks on this often but it’s not a familiar thing to those who don’t actually deal with them.  Basically all the wealthy and powerful ones are, so in effect the important bad ones we have are another species of elite white shitlibs working against the badwhites.They’re sort of used to playing the socially conscious role to maintain their power over disorganized brown hordes (the usual 2% gambit) which is probably a thing most of us will end up doing worse come to worse.  That mentality is currently foreign to us badwhites used to being in the majority.I think you’re absolutely wrong about muslims (as distinct from arabs) though.  They have a foreign hostile creed in addition to (usually) pretty different genes that lead to all sorts of behaviors unsuitable for our civilization.  That’s nowhere to go looking for domestic(!) allies.  They’re almost as bad as the 2%, and even worse in some salient ways.

I appreciate your comments and I hope you stick around.
We’re getting down to the fundamental issue: With non-whites, what is deeper, race or Civ Nat values?
While there is no scientific answer, most observations show that even assimilated non-whites feel a deeper loyalty to their race than to any universal values. If that’s true, we waste our resources when we try to persuade them.
Almost all non-whites would rather live in a dysfunctional society that their race dominates, rather than a more prosperous Civ Nat society, unless they are colonizing ours.

                                    Well, Italians and Irish used to be very clannish also. I don’t believe that is the case any longer since subsequent generations have blended in to the country. The dysfunctionality that you are referring to is a byproduct of the evil that has been working to corrode the American way for over 100 years. What do people want? They want to Improve their economic lot in life, they want security, and there’s only one political party that promotes that. If that political party, by which I mean the republican party, were to be the party of just the wealthy, or just white people, there would be no option for our fellow humans to choose. I cannot think of any other way to do this but by getting men like Tim Scott or an east Indian or south Indian, or Hispanic, to preach the values of America and civic nationalism, whatever the hell that term means. I assume it means anybody who believes in the founding principles.

We have work to do.
God made some people better than others; Jesus told us to help and covert them. Enlighten them. Strange that God would do this, but who am I to argue with him. Loving others is a bitch, until you really don’t have a choice.
This blog preaches community. Drop the exclusions. We’re not talking about winning hearts and minds in Vietnam. If America wasn’t intended for non-Northern Europeans, it’s a bit too late to advocate that.
Make it unpopular to be a loser. Commies and their agents are losers.

                                                Throughout the Bible God recognizes the existence and legitimacy of nations, and nations are blood &amp; soil. Nowhere does he even imply that helping other people means diluting nations.
Wanting to live in a White nation doesn’t mean hating the people of other nations. It also doesn’t mean inviting them all into mine.

                                                    Help equals charity and improving life outcomes through education. Not Welfare.  As far as living in a white nation, hasn’t that ship sailed already?  “Have 2 children” was all the rage in the late 60’s. We listened and now we are paying.  Breed baby breed, just don’t complain when the vacuum gets filled.

Nietzsche would hate me because my Christianity guides me. We need it to guide others as well, which the founders alluded as well. Otherwise, we might as well head for South America.

                                    I kinda think educating people in the truth is doing something for someone. Or helping a poor family so that the gov won’t make them dependent. The best victory for America is to take away the power to tax, except for defense and other federal necessities. But that would require a virtuous society working together with intact families and with a strong local system of private charity to help people who cannot help themselves. You will always have the poor unless you believe Margaret Sanger and PP.

                                We are being betrayed by whites—greedy in some cases, pathetically uneducated in other cases. Honestly, growing up with other types of people was not a problem until the slow drip of poison divided us, and when the evil godless president came to fundamentally transform by weaponizing tyranny against a bogeyman called “whiteness.”

                                    growing up with other types of people was not a problem
Until I was a gradeschooler, this was a nearly 90% White country. Growing up with other types of people wasn’t even a thing. And in most of the country, even until my adulthood it wasn’t.
All those jobs that are now taken up by Somalis, Hispanics, Koreans and Indians? That was a rarity in most of the country. Those jobs were held by White kids.

                                    My kids are with whites. You lost your ability to reason here. Ok, I hope Trump loses because no black, brown, or yellow voted for him.
Expecting apologies now from the chorus. We can all form a community together. Until Harris uses the military to exterminate us. But, by gum, we held to our principles!

You are the one who is being short-sighted.  You can’t look past your fear of being called racist to see the dismal track record of colorblind civic nationalism since the 1960’s.

                            You just gave up. Surrendered. Made a bogus claim. Civ Nat worked at one time. But you cannot understand why it may no longer work. Yet you all read the literature and now reduce it to race.That’s lazy.I think you would be totally sad, if not depressed, if Trump won 30% of the black vote and a good percentage of the Hispanic vote, and won a huge electoral victory, with those same classes of people committing themselves to working for the American dream because they learned something awful about the left the last couple of years. I really think that would make you sad.

                    Edit: they are also in the military and in law-enforcement. This is so obvious but yet many here don’t count them as allies or as good people. Trump is re-creating the old republican party, but it must be done carefully so as to not alienate those who may find commonality with us. The rhinos will be co-opted, seen as frauds, and will be unceremoniously dumped.

                                While the military is ostensibly desegregated, the reality was that most non-Whites voluntarily went for support roles. The serious combat units were disproportionately, if not uniformly, White and disproportionately Southern. My son had black and hispanic soldiers under him in the 101st Airborne, but it was surprising how few there were compared to the overall racial makeup of the armed forces. And there were no women at all in the enlisted ranks of 101st at that point (up til 2018). One of the reasons my son left the 101st was  because he saw that women would soon be forced on the airborne units and he wanted to avoid the minefield of being a senior NCO over women who could destroy his career with an accusation and who he knew from watching other units would not carry their weight.

                                    Yep! It sucks. If Trump wins and doesn’t clean house, then I know it’s over. Since you have carried on with me without insult (I think) perhaps you might understand why I have chosen the dreaded Civ Nat route. Nobody else here has proposed anything that would offer hope and some kind of coexistence under a less corrupt federal government. I sense that people just give up hope and they want to retreat. I prefer to fight and stick it to the bastards. Exterminate them, in fact.

                                        Since you have carried on with me without insult (I think)That’s been my intent. If there was any insult mixed in there it was unintentional.I can get really cranky on my bad days, but I’m trying to be better about that.I think your particular solution hasn’t a prayer of working. It is stuff that I have been hearing since I was a teenager, and which has been a feature of conservative politics since the 1800s.Unfortunately, conservatism spent so many decades not conserving anything that it is now dead. There’s no “nat” to “civ.” Our only hope lies in a new nation.You don’t have any good examples or success stories to bolster your arguments.If you could have told me “Just look how nice Yugoslavia is with all those different Muslim and Christian ethnic groups living together in peace,” that would have been great, or “Look how well the Kurds have integrated into Turkey and Iraq,” or “The brotherly love between Hutus and Tutsi is inspirational,” or “Look how happy the Whites and blacks in South Africa are together,” I might be inclined to give your argument some credence.Me, I see “look how lovely the Icelandic people are, like one big family.” And “look how culturally cohesive the Japanese are” and I see cautionary tales: “Look at the trouble formerly homogeneous, idyllic Scandinavian countries are encountering due to letting in African and Middle Eastern immigrants.”Every example I can think of emphasizes the need for separation.“It may be inferred again that the present movement for women’s rights will certainly prevail from the history of its only opponent, Northern conservatism. This [Northern conservatism] is a party which never conserves anything. Its history has been that it demurs to each aggression of the progressive party, and aims to save its credit by a respectable amount of growling, but always acquiesces at last in the innovation. What was the resisted novelty of yesterday is today one of the accepted principles of conservatism; it is now conservative only in affecting to resist the next innovation, which will tomorrow be forced upon its timidity and will be succeeded by some third revolution; to be denounced and then adopted in its turn. American conservatism is merely the shadow that follows Radicalism as it moves forward towards perdition. It remains behind it, but never retards it, and always advances near its leader. This pretended salt hath utterly lost its savor: wherewith shall it be salted? Its impotency is not hard, indeed, to explain. It is worthless because it is the conservatism of expediency only, and not of sturdy principle. It intends to risk nothing serious for the sake of the truth, and has no idea of being guilty of the folly of martyrdom. It always when about to enter a protest very blandly informs the wild beast whose path it essays to stop, that its “bark is worse than its bite,” and that it only means to save its manners by enacting its decent role of resistance: The only practical purpose which it now subserves in American politics is to give enough exercise to Radicalism to keep it “in wind,” and to prevent its becoming pursy and lazy, from having nothing to whip.”― Robert Lewis Dabney, 1820-1898

                                            Excellent comment. You have done a fine job presenting the argument.I gave up on the Conservative Movement when NR and others turned on Trump. I then decided to be a nationalist, so I must be a white nationalist. A black person who wants MAGA is a black nationalist, as I see it. I see no problem with being a nationalist and have been all along. We might be in a slightly different position than Scandinavia because they have always been white while the US has a history of race mixture, but in recent years the tap was left open for too long.In conclusion, I hope for a Trump victory and welcome support from non-whites. I do believe that you are right about the inevitable outcome, then we will be a Balkanized nation. Just trying to fight that in the sunset of America.

Courage to act in our own self-interest. What you suggest is just more cowardice draped in the flag.It seems you seek to further the empire and not a future for our people. Perhaps it is you who should drift toward the donkey for a ride to utopia.The myth of alchemy of poc democrats becoming republicans because material success is a melting pot of retardation and magic negro that has already destroyed generations of white men. How many more until black gold appears?We do not alienate; they are aliens. This is not a Nation to them but rather a Game. They are more than happy to play along collecting stats while asserting their own values and priorities into the essence of the sport until we no longer recognize it.The blank slate proposition nation of civnat makes this possible.“…recreating the old republican party”.“Please clap”

Now let’s look at you. I began with a comment about whites being in an awful demographic position, and no one comments on that except to beg for a White state.
I support the idea of getting electoral help from people of color as a means to winning against an evil group, but everyone simply denigrates on the basis of race.
Yes, the heart of the matter for many of you is race. Not governance, elections, not defeating evil.

                        I lived close to you for 60 years. Left there and have a safe house in a veritable scorpion’s nest where Antifa or BLM won’t dare to tread. I do occasionally read those authors and I respect Jared Taylor because he is honest and he makes a good case for whites. I also realize that whites have done massive amounts of work towards building civilizations which have provided comfort, health, and wealth for many people. You keep wanting to draw me into a scientific argument about race and I think it’s too late to even try to win the support of others and elections by making those arguments.  I trust in the Lord, and I have to be an example to all people, as difficult as that may be for me, to lead them to the truth and to wean them away from their arguments about race, their claims on reparations, their faith in false promises of hope and change, or political power given to the 13 percent. You’re a smart guy cause I’ve read your comments. But if you think for one minute that that 13% or that 30% of Hispanics are going to have any real political power after a Biden victory, and after the complete global communist takeover of the United States, that is pure delusion. I know who the real enemy is.

You can’t put them back together.”You: “This bomb isn’t so bad, it’s really quite nice, if you look at it just right. Very sparkly! Parts of it could have been our bomb!”Me: “It blew our house up.

                            If you respected Jared Taylor you would not be making the comments you do.
If your civ-nat utopia were possible, you would still be living in Los Angeles, not your alleged “scorpion’s nest.”
And your investment in this thread looks like shilling to me.

                                I agree with Taylor since we whites are being hunted.I live where I do because I wanted a place that was safe for family.  Your supposition about minorities in LA never has affected me, but now that the politicians have given them the green light to steal legally, I left in rebellion against the one party system in CA. The minority never became so emboldened until leftists took control in CA. There is no hypocrisy there.Your shilling claim is false. I simply want to win this election and think there is a good chance. Being a Civ Nat, what else would you expect me to do? All of us who stay in the fight would love to see Trump get 20%+ of the Black vote. You really have to be hateful to be so dismissive of good souls who are not white.  If we cannot right the ship then I made the right decision to move. I don’t wish to tell you that you must have neighbors that you don’t like. You can stay or leave.

            I did have the thought that maybe Trump is trying to make a play for the GOP to be the chief uniparty beneficiary.  Same sheet music but different musicians kinda thing.

                Maybe. Right now I’ll settle for Trump if it will keep the levers of power away from genocidal maniacs.
The next 4 years for Trump must be on indictments. Rule of law.
