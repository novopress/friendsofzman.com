        And here’s Hillary, the anti-Nockian, speaking to the Black Lives Matter crew just yesterday:
“Look, I don’t believe you change hearts,” Clinton shot back. “I believe you change laws, you change allocation of resources, you change the way systems operate. You’re not going to change every heart. You’re not.”
I heard that and I cringed.   Hillary, you are wrong.  Again, and always.  You can argue Civil Rights legislation helped, but there wouldn’t have even been civil rights legislation in the first place had not enough people “changed hearts” to put an end to officially-sanctioned segregation.

            It is a weird fetish with the Left. They truly believe government is magical. I have a lefty acquaintance who will say how crooked and evil insurance companies, while demanding government run health insurance. I’ll point out to her that we can send insurance men to jail or take their money when they screw up. You can’t do that with government and she will say that’s why you can trust government.It’s why I stopped thinking there’s anything resembling logic to these people. Gun control is where you really see it. I still hear them talk about gun show loophole, even thought it has been debunked for decades now.
