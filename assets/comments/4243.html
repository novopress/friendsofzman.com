        “but we aren’t going to reward people who are better negotiators with more compensation.”This sounds perfect for trade unionism. No matter what your skills, no matter what your ability, you will be required to do the same thing for the same money and any excellence will be destroyed by less-talented but greedier people than yourself. Anyway, nice to see the old lefty version of paradise re-emerging under a different name.It also presumes — whether ‘studies’ back this up or not — that women are incapable of negotiating a better life for themselves. This woman has unilaterally decided that the female of the species is helpless and therefore at a disadvantage. If I was braver I would like to suggest this to my wife and daughter or even my daughter-in-law, all of whom have very definite abilities to manage their own lives. Telling them they are helpless and easily deceived is not actually true in my experience.But then, in all fairness they aren’t the sort of people who would apply for a job at a silly company that does nothing useful.
