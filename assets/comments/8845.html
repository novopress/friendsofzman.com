        World governments, whether led by the Church or by the Political Elite, have always failed, every time. They cannot control people at the local level, though a lot of butchery and burning neighborhoods to the ground goes on in the process (see the Middle East for a current example).But people are so easily fooled. They root for the Rebels at a Star Wars movie and then go vote for Darth Vader at the next election.  At times, I believe the entire “socialization” process of our culture is a conscious effort to “dumb down” everyone, so that they will support whatever stupid thing that gets fed to them.  In the meantime, sites such as this one allow some of us to realize that we are not alone in our scepticism of what we are fed on a daily basis.  Of course, posting on these sites also helps TPTB build their lists for use later on.  We live in strange times.

        Made this comment elsewhere this morning, but it works for this piece as well:Come what may in the election, my hope is that Trump is the harbinger of the creation of a new political party along the lines of the Populists of yore. The Republican Party as a legitimate opposition has ceased to exist already, so if there is to be any opposition to control of legal tender by a private banking cabal, to unfettered immigration, to globalist excess, to excessive centralization and federal control, to a Supreme Court that has become a super-legislature, to a squandering of taxpayer funds that shouldn’t be pried from the public in the first place, to government-subsidized organizations that promote perversion, to affirmative action displacement of freedom of choice and merit….Time for a new politics, people. Trump is the first sign of it; he is the actual “Republican in name only” who brought populism under the Repub tent and thus captured much of its political machine. Win or lose, one hopes he doesn’t surrender and applies his wealth to the creation of a new party. One hopes he wins, but win, lose or draw, he has an opportunity to carve out a place in history while the Rod Drehers of the world will be consigned to its dustbin.

            Can’t keep honest capitalism with an income tax.Wouldn’t need things like loss carry-forward (I use it, a lot), crony debt leverage, or Fed Reserve ‘planning’ if government were a disinterested observer and measurement, not performance, were the goal.
The fantasy finally took over when FDR decided to include government spending as a part of GDP to hide the disastrous nosedive of WWII costs to the economy.

        The globalist currents of today look a lot like neo-feudalism. Medieval upper class based their legitimacy in a God given right.  Our upper class base their legitimacy in extreme wealth gained by skimming government contracts and financial manipulations.

            Years ago I saw  what I regarded as a profound statement:
“In 1776 the United States overthrew Aristocratic rule.   Ever since the Aristocrats have been working to reestablish control.”
Communism always was a form of Monarchy/Aristocracy.   They just lied about it.

        The model for the coming mandarin rule is organized crime. A global Mafia will run everything. Instead of The Five Families, it will be The Fifty Families. We will live by their leave. Politics and the rule of law will be a sham. The “presidents” of various countries will be puppets on strings, starting with Hilary.

            I see the same thing.  The Family, nested mafias- we are seeing the natural expression of the deepest social instinct.‘Ideology’ is monkey barking.  Social signaling.Self programming.  Our sound signals show the jockeying for position as we leap from branch to branch,  trying for a higher branch.The supposed ‘truths’ are irrelevant; what is universal are the emotions we respond with.Do I hear the familiar hoots and calls of many allies- or am I surrounded by those stranger monkeys from that other tree?Humans organize the same style group structures with the same social mechanisms, everywhere, everywhen, with remarkable consistency.This holds the promise of predictability- and zman has just asked the most fascinating of questions: what comes next?  Who will be in the top of the Tree?

        Terrific book on the revolutions of 1848, appropriately titled 1848:https://www.amazon.com/1848-Year-Revolution-Mike-Rapport/dp/0465020674In 1848 liberals died on the barricades for the cause of obtaining a written constitution to limit the power of the Monarchy. Ironic that less than 100 years later liberals in America started their concerted efforts to destroy the American constitution. The worm turns . . .Reverting to an older post, yesterday I had the ill fortune to catch David French interviewed by Terry Gross on Fresh Air about the harassment he received from the nasty alt-right people on the Internet. French just can’t seem to resist climbing in bed with the left. Listen to both interviews if you can stomach them. French’s interview is a perfectly sickening combination of moral preening, virtue signaling, and smug altruism. Apparently he was just an ordinary Joe who was minding his own business and when he decided he would not support Trump for President the alt-right launched a vicious, unprovoked attack against him, his wife, and his African-American daughter. Did you know he had an African-American daughter? He mentioned it once or twice in the interview.http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/You’re going to have a ball with this one, Zman.

                Only if French is holding a framed photo of Eric Erickson. Then, I’m totally on board. Or, printouts of his wife’s social media accounts, fawning over black men.

        Z-man, Douthat is plagiarizing you hardcore over at the NYT today. Which is to say he’s taking your premises about managerialism and conservatism and building his own mangled conclusions on top.  Pretty entertaining.

            Douthat is such a doughy little cuck – really, if you just put a hipster beard on the Pillsbury dough boy.  And has anyone ever actually seen him and Matty Yglesias in the same room together?http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/opinion/campaign-stops/what-the-rights-intellectuals-did-wrong.html?_r=0Is this the piece you’re talking about?  I read it yesterday and it’s laugh out loud ridiculous.Pudgy Ross would have you seriously believe that if only the beltway boys over at NR and WS had somehow found it in their hearts to take Trump and the people he represents seriously, then, by their gracious wisdom and guiding hand they could have purged the movement of its embarrassing excesses and built an “intellectually serious populism” (Ross’ exact phrase).What Ross is really worried about is that he’s been tossed into the dustbin of history, and his cozy little doghouse on the outskirts of the establishment – which he worked hard for all these years by being a nice, housebroken pet and begging for table scraps – is going away.No more biscuits for you, Ross.  Bad dog.

                Bloomberg used to say he was in charge of the eighth largest army in the world: the NYPD. NYC already functions like a city state; I’ve long wondered why there’s no active secession/partition movement in New York state. Upstate and downstate are deeply, fundamentally different places.

        My view of this is that mainstream political parties in the West and other places have been forced to adopt Neoliberal economics, especially after the 80s, the Bill Clinton “thir way”  non-sense and so on.
The death of the EU would be a mortal blow to globalism, my dream is that after the end of the EU and NATO Belgium is split between France and Netherlands, the country only exist because Napoleon lost Waterloo and became home of globalist institutions that diminished continental European powers.

        Still slowly working my way through Arendt. She notes that prior to the French Revolution the word “revolution” implied a return to an older, more traditional way of doing things. A going back. The Copernican Revolution meant the cycle of the planets, not some new thing. When Lametrie (?) told Louis about the Bastille, Louis said it was a revolt, Lametrie replied no it’s a revolution. He had in mind that things would go back to the way things had been prior to the king’s great grandfather when provincial parlements would have to approve whatever the king proposed, not that there would be anything new. Everyone was expecting a constitutional monarchy. For them this was one of the English revolutions under an enlightened monarch. This guy knew the history and wouldn’t lose his head like Charles did.As for the radicalism of the French Revolution, one usually thinks of The Terror. Far from being some left wing grass roots movement, it was a calculated move by the Jacobins in control of the Committee for Public Safety to eliminate other contenders for power on both the left and right. The first people executed were the far left Hebertists. Many people don’t realize this but Robert Mugabe did the same thing in Rhodesia. It was his guys who Skype give away the locations of other contenders for leadership to the Rhodesian Army so they could be killed if they weren’t placing the car bombs themselves. After he took power, most of those he had murdered were former allies. But this is the kind of thing we hear about when we hear of royal usurpers or read Macbeth, right? Yes. What that means is that there is nothing new about the left, they just dress up their treachery in the language of ideology, and everything’s all right. Idealism just got defenestrated.Just last night I picked up a book that’s been sitting on my desk for a month, Political Elites by an Englishman, Geraint Parry. Mainly about the theory of managerial elitism in government. Begins with Mosca and Pareto, who thought a bourgeois managerial elite was inevitable. Maybe they were right. We certainly have them. All over the world. The questions for the future for us and for those yet unborn are whether they are necessary, if they are how can we control them vs them controlling us; if they are not necessary, how we rid ourselves of them, and finally, if we rid ourselves of them, what will we have when they are gone? Will it be the classless so with dreamed of by Marx? Remember, Marx did not consider himself a socialist, or an egalitarian. Food for thought.

        In the progressive imagination all his thoughts are new and life began with his arrival. He believes himself to be the cure for the recurring plague infecting humanity. He has no idea that he is the plague. Tocqueville–“The unity, the universality, the omnipotence of society’s power, and the uniformity of its rules represent the outstanding feature of all the political systems invented in our day. They recur at the heart of the strangest utopias. The human mind still pursues these images even in its dreams. If the brilliant talkers and writers of that time were to return to life, I do not believe that gas, or steam, or chloroform, or the electric telegraph, would so much astonish them as the dulness of modern society, and the mediocrity of modern books.”

        Fascism is the coming thing.  Not as in “Hillary / Trump is going to win the election, ha ha!”  I mean the real thing.  National Socialism.  We’re living a soft form of it now — ask any “conservative,” True(tm) or otherwise, what his plans are to phase out Social Security.  The fact is, living like ghetto/trailer trash is very appealing for the **majority** of our population; only the externals are different for the so-called middle class (except for the fact that the drug dealing/taking is being done at Starbucks and not on the corner, what’s the difference between urban SWPLs’ beloved Swedish universal college and childcare, and ghetto gibs?  Both groups want to live like retired hunter-gatherers).  So strap on the armbands.  We proles get gibs, the Managerial Class gets to keep on keepin’ on in the Outer Party, and constant low-level bush wars or the threat thereof are good to keep everyone’s mind off the creeping police state. What’s not to love?

            We already have fascism. Social democracy is just fascism stripped of the martial aspects. It’s why the people in charge are always calling for unity and inclusiveness. The question is whether global fascism is a real thing that can hold up under challenge.

                I don’t mean “global fascism,” though.  I mean **national** socialism.  As in, take Bernie Sanders’ platform, pledge to add wall on every border to it, and 90% of Americans would vote for it.  Pledge to end all aid to Israel immediately and you’re up to 92%.  Pledge to end all foreign aid entirely and you’re at 95%.  Add Trump’s NAFTA renegotiation and protective tariffs and you’ve got just about everybody.  Socialism for Americans, Islamism or whatever barbarity they choose for everyone else.  It’s not like Wall St. hasn’t worked hand-in-glove with national socialists before…

        This post makes a common mistake. Let’s start with Marx. He was always wrong.The world is not about governments legitimizing parasites. The world is not about workers and oppressive capital. It is about the never ending human quest for self-actualization, which is only possible in a free society, versus oppressive, overarching totalitarianism in any form.Fascism is only a form of socialism / communism, which is only a form of totalitarianism. The easy test of any government is does it end up rewarding parasites, or does it seek to minimize them through culture and law?Any government striving to legitimize parasites will inevitably end up with totalitarian overlords, stagnation and collapse. The reason is simple. The bureaucracy and inefficiency becomes brittle, unadaptive and ultimately financially unviable.Progressives like Obama are cool with world government not because it will be a form of capitalism, but because it will not. It will be social democracy writ large; a total loss of the concept of value, with a totalitarian ruling class. We will all get much poorer and live as third worlders with cell phones. But it will all collapse long before that. It’s happening now.Freedom orientations on the other hand, are complex networks which are adaptive, innovative and able to survive. Free markets based on property rights are complex networks. But our economics does not sufficiently understand free markets yet. Even our understanding of management theory is horrifically bureaucratic and too hierarchical and inefficient.If we truly cared about human advancement, like any complex organism, we would intentionally split countries and large bureaucratic corporations into smaller pieces in order to avoid the sclerosis they engender and the power they wield. Even if it was more inefficient we would do it to preserve the culture and society which best nurtures human choice and advancement and innovation.Good website:) Keep thinking. It is a pleasure to read.

        What comes next_?  VERY interesting discussion.  Supposing that Progressiveism was an attempt at priestly rule under their new/old religion:  What happens in history when priestly rule collapses under accumulated errors created by the elemental mistake that really smart humans can attain the power and status of God Almighty_?Answer: Barbarian take-over or (slightly more hopefully given who the barbarians are these days) warlord rule establishing a new dynasty via defeating said barbarians after a period of chaos in which many peasants die.  Better stock up even though that won’t be enough if you have the ‘bad luck’ to be in the path.
