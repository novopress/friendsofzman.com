        The actions and words of these politicians pledging loyalty to Israel doesn’t sound so much like being bought off as it does being fearful. Fearful in a sense of harm than just being politically ruined. Those multiple standing ovations for Netanyahu in speeches at the Capital were Stalin like.
The founding of Israel was the founding of a terrorist state.  Terrorizing British politicians (letter bombs?) was only part of it. Look at what Mossad did, killing scientists and diplomats in Iran to achieve objectives. They will do it to anybody, anywhere and that point was driven home long ago.

                Some is the key word here . . . the evidence is thin but not thinner than many a history claim out there on whatever subject.
More interesting, why is it so obscure?

            “The founding of Israel was the founding of a terrorist state.”
Right in the 1920s and 1930s, when gangs like Stern and Irgun started terrorizing and murdering Palestinian villagers. Quite a few Israeli prime ministers belonged to one of these gangs in their youth — Begin, Shamir, probably others as well. That is to say, these gangs are at the foundation of the Israeli state. And the modus operandi remains the same — assassination and terror.

                That’s an important point, and gets to one of the main problems: it is easy to indiscriminately murder people you consider subhuman, and to destroy their cultures. Whether it is a religious Jew who thinks he is Chosen, or an atheistic Ashkenazim who thinks he is superior, the sense of racial entitlement is the foundation and raison d’etre of Israel and its assets in the diaspora.

                That’s true but I’m tellin’ ya–Israel was established as the foothold of “the money power” that rules the world from the City (of London) and their hangers-on on Paris and Wall Street and a few other places. The Jews were chosen (!) b/c they *are* attack dogs who regard the rest of the world as cattle. It was a big plus that in 1948, the Nuernberg trials were just in the offing and the Holo-you-know-what was just beginning to become a thing, and that there was the Balfour Declaration out there and that bonds had been sold to finance the whole thing and that (((they))) had by 1948 gained control of all newspapers and radio broadcasting networks that mattered–in short, the time was right; couldn’t have been more propitious.Israel’s purpose is what it has always been: Prevent any power other than that of “the money power” that does IN FACT rule the world from arising in that resource-rich but perennially backward area of the world. The fact that (((they))) are ruthless and vicious is gravy for the “Redshields” and their hangers-on. And the “money power” shops in the bargain basement that is Washington, DC.

I thought it was axiomatic in antisemitism that The Money Power and The Jews are the same thing, or at least that the former is a subset of the latter?

I find it interesting that they thought the release of the Mossad phone calls threatening the families of Iranian VIPs would play far better than it did in the MSM.

                There’s plenty to take umbrage over all the same.  For one, how many spies they’ve planted/turned within our government agencies.  Probably second only to China and Russia.  Yet crickets….

                        20 years ago I chuckled at the 9/11 truthers with their “controlled demolition” ideas and the stuff about, what was it – building 7? The one that collapsed even though it wasn’t hit by a plane.Now, like the President inIdiocracy, you can call me Not Sure. I’d say the lies and overt authoritarianism of the Coofening broke me loose from my old skepticism. The revelations that keep coming out about Mossad and Our Greatest Ally have fullyshifted my perspective to regard the entire state apparatus as a deadly enemy under alien control. Of course, this latest act of aggression against Iran and of course the Gaza genocide have certainly helped change my views.

                    Jonathan Pollard, who Trump pardoned in 2021, is a great example of this. He gave up to the Israelis our literal playbook on signals intelligence, giving Mossad the ability to avoid our snooping and likely helped them develop new techniques to snoop themselves.

            These people are monstrous? You’re telling me this for the first time?
Can you imagine what other evils they could do? They might even be capable of poisoning water supplies, kidnapping and murdering children, usury, lying, cheating, coin-clipping, pornography, and cultural subversion.
These “Mossad” types sound like a very evil people — right up there with the worst kinds of people in recorded history. The kinds that get isolated and expelled because of their wicked deeds.

                And that’s a good segue into white replacement. That’s why they did that to us, because they knew we would get fed up at some point. I guess they weren’t smart enough to realize that brown people like them even less than we do.

They really failed to realize their pets carry zero guilt for WW2 Germany.
It’s fun watching the pets turn on those who presumed to be their masters.

            I don’t buy the fear explanation. Israel is a flyspeck and Jews are an infinitesimal fraction of the world population. If the white elite in AINO really wanted to, they could squash Israel like a scorpion and scatter the Jews to the four winds. They have the power to do this. The fact that they don’t strongly suggests to me that worship rather than fear is the primary motivation for the unmoored adulation of Our Greatest Ally.

                Similarly, we could say that worship rather than fear is the primary motivation for the unmoored adulation of our second greatest tribe of trouble makers. It’s not Biblical, so it must be their athleticism, song and dance, or plain ol’white guilt. African juju, black magic maybe?

                Can’t we juggle more than one ball at a time? This is not either/or. Let’s list some qualities: To begin Worship/Envy/rumbling Terror as higher Ashkenazi IQ shows up as adept at manipulation and control which is vital in politics; Prestige, run with the cool kids cult and hate the dirt people because the ruling overlords do; Fear of stepping out of line; Avarice aka greased palms and possibly being supplied with children to diddle to satisfy large appetites of growing perversion coupled with boredom aka eat-drink-screw-ad infinitum, and the money with which to do it. Sabbatean Frankists of the Chabad rule our pols. Keep your eye on the Noahide Laws working their way in. Not good for the Goy. People are fairly easily controlled. Think of what kept the Aztecs in line.

            When Netenyahu says that Iran has attempted to assassinate Trump, is that an honest reporting of fact, a lie to get Trump to attack Iran, or is it a threat that if Trump doesn’t do what they want, he might end up like Kennedy, with the blame going on Iran?
Was Netenyahu’s gift to Trump of a gold plated pager of the kind used to blow up all the Hezbollah members a sincere gift of appreciation, or was it a threat?

            Israel was founded because Lord Rothschild traded the effectuating of US entry into WW1 for the Balfour Declaration in 1917….Subsequently, the two main Zionist terrorist groups made it too dangerous and expensive for the UK to stay in Palestine, blowing up the King David hotel and intimidating British politicians in various ways…Meanwhile, in Palestine they were robbing, raping and killing Palestinian families and seizing their homes…Despite condemning these terrorists publicly, Ben-Gurion gave them medals in secret..The only hiccup occurred after the Suez War in 1956, when Israel refused to leave some Egyptian land..Ike informed them that they would abandon such claims immediately “or else”…Israel complied. Subsequently, Israel attacked the USN Liberty and almost sank it, because it was recording Israel’s atrocities, including the execution of Egyptian prisoners…When JFK demanded inspection of Israel’s nuclear program, Mossad and a rogue element of the CIA assassinated him…In short, Israel has always been a terrorist state, and always will be….

                The Brits declared war on Germany twice. If they wanted to keep Palestine against a few Jewish terrorists, they would have. They were never really for the Zionist project, but in they were never really against it either.

            George Gallowayax’da caller to his show: “By what authority did England give Palestine to the Jews?” This is not a precise quote but, amazingly enough, the following analysis is:“Galloway contends that the Balfour Declaration, which promised a ‘national home for the Jewish people’ in Palestine, was made by ‘one people promising to a second people the land that belonged to a third people before the people promising to give it away even possessed it in their hands.’ He argues that this declaration lacked ‘any right, authority or consent from anyone’ and believes Britain has a ‘historic obligation greater than any other country to side with the victims’ of this act. He advocates for the UK to declare the Balfour Declaration ‘invalidated, cancelled, dead, no longer in effect, no longer feasible!’ ”It always boils down to the hubris, pride, and corruption of the so-called “elite,” doesn’t it? Idiots like Harari and Gates and Soros and Musk believe that they can “live forever” through their transmogrification into a computer system. Truly pathetic. Signed,Boris.

        We are in the early stages of watching the sun set on Israel worship. Poll after poll shows the further someone is from drawing Social Security the more they oppose Our Greatest Ally. The Israelis also read these polls and study American actuarial tables, and they know the window is closing on their ability to get the United States to fund and commit its atrocities. Hence, the accelerated ethnic cleansing of Gaza and the recent failed war against Iran.I may not be sentient, but I will live to see the GAE divorced from Israel, or at least having filed its petition to do so. It is absolutely shocking how much the D.C. humps betrayed the public to prop up this homicidal state, and my contempt is mostly directed against them, but God speed the day I never hear the word “Israel” repeated like it is the most important thing in my remaining days.

                                Yeah, those two phenomena would doom anyone’s chances in media, ya think? But talk radio is chock full of hosts and announcers whose tonalities irk the hell out of me. Chris Plante’s dismembered stream-of-consciousness ramblings are a “good” example of the former, while the nameless announcer for Salem Radio (long may he remain so–for his sake–and…mine) is a “good” example of the latter.

                        That was a fun show for us post-embryonic Boomers. IIRC, one character was a “professor” who employed some sort of expanding portable blackboard who explained how things worked. But alas, this was before the late Sixties, when “superhero” cartoons took over, featuring bad guys shouting for the protagonists’ violent deaths. Oh, well–sic transit, Gloria Mundy!

            Yes, the charade is getting harder to pull off. The uproar this time showed that. In the past, Cruz would have only heard cheers and seen money. This time, he heard boos as well. In the future, the boos will grow louder and louder.
Sure, they can ignore the boos, but they won’t be able to deny how unpopular this worship of Jews and Israel has become. Naturally, they’ll just retreat into their bubble even more, but that’s never a long-term strategy.

            I think so too. White Americans are not antisemites and probably never can be antisemites, but they are tiring of the relationship with Israel and by extension the Israel lobby. This sort of generosity is a good times indulgence, but the good times are over, so we can no longer afford to indulge this madness.

                The Jews are old testament and the Christian religion builds on that. I know some people here will disagree, but I don’t think we’re too far apart in the big picture way of looking at things. I don’t think we’re that far apart with muzzies, either. Oh, sure, you can pick apart the quran and look for language that hasn’t stood the test of time or take issue with the fact that Jesus is only a prophet, but I’m just talking teneral value system people have and it doesn’t seem too much different to me.But I’m a big picture person. I don’t waste my time on the details of the sort of thing.

                        Judaism and Christianity share several fundamental similarities, stemming from their common roots in Abrahamic tradition. Both are monotheistic religions, believing in one God, the creator of the universe. They also share a foundational text, the Hebrew Bible (known as the Tanakh in Judaism and the Old Testament in Christianity), and emphasize ethical behavior and moral teachings.Here’s a more detailed breakdown:Monotheism:Both religions firmly believe in one God, the creator of all things.Shared Scripture:Both consider the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh/Old Testament) a sacred text, though interpretations and some books may differ.Ethical Frameworks:Both religions emphasize ethical behavior, with teachings on love, justice, mercy, and social responsibility.Prophets:Both recognize prophets who communicated God’s word, with Moses being a central figure in Judaism and Jesus in Christianity.Concepts of God:Both believe in a God who is both transcendent (existing beyond the physical world) and immanent (present and active in the world).Importance of Love and Forgiveness:Both religions place a strong emphasis on love, forgiveness, and repentance, with the Golden Rule (doing unto others as you would have them do unto you) being a central teaching.Concept of Messiah:While Christianity believes Jesus was the Messiah, Judaism still awaits his arrival.Family Values and Holy Living:Both religions place importance on family values and striving for a holy life, with an emphasis on helping the oppressed and promoting peace.

                            I don’t know how you can downvote that, it’s all factually true. Now if you want to talk about cultural difference, sure. But the religions themselves are about as different as Burger King versus Wendy’s. In fact, Orthodoxy borrows some things from Judaism.

                                They kind of sort of share some things maybe.  The true foundational text for the jews is the talmud, not the OT.
Your list is so generic you could say the same for just about any organized religion, perhaps with the exception of Jesus and monotheism (pagans believed in “family values” as do atheists).  Not to mention, things such as “peace” mean different things to jews than to Christians (and other normal people).  To jews, it means ruling the world and every non-jew bowing and scraping to them.

                                It can be downvoted because it’s not factually true. The list you presented is largely wishful thinking when it comes to morals. There is a God sized gap on the question of Jesus, who is not merely a prophet in Christianity.

                                Perhaps because your list has the smell of an AI response?  Not that I don’t use such, but I’m careful to notate such.In any event, there are a number of good refutations below.  In short, the wonderful “basics” you outline are not the standard practice of most of the Orthodox Jewish sects.  Such wonderful moral aspects of Judaism (and Christianity) are kept among the Jews for the Jews themselves.  The goyim can go pound sand as they are not God’s chosen.This is the problem with your itemized list.  The morals are applied from Jews, to Jews and not necessarily any other non-Jews. The exact opposite from Christianity’s teachings.Of course, there are some Jewish sects that embrace universality more than others.  In there lies your confusion.

                            Rubbish. The Jews’ religion has been based upon either the Babylonian Talmud or upon the Palestinian Talmud since the third century. Their religion is therefore younger than Christianity, and the Christian Old Testament is NOT regarded by present-day Judaism as Scripture. You can look ALL of this up in theJewish Encyclopedia,where you will also read that today’s Judaism is Phariseeism.

                            Jesus came with a sword to divide: the Hebrews split into Jews and Christians. It’s an unresolved ‘civil war’. Don’t understand why people don’t get that. Why else would Christians give a hoot about Jews, and vice versa?

It’s a political statement, addressing the central issue.
As an example, the big divide between Peter and Paul was Peter wanted circumcision to define the followers, Paul did not. Whose ways would rule, Hebrew or Roman? Nationalism or citizenism? Exclusion or outreach?
What does it mean, to be an “American”?Who is Ted Cruz?

                                    The Great Commission, if you ask me, was Jesus saying, “If I couldn’t get through to them, you can’t. Go preach to the Gentiles.” Hence John’s gospel for the Greeks, the Peter/Paul fight you mention. (If judaizing is a heresy, that makes Peter a heretic btw.) In any case, both had an axe to grind with the Jews, that Jesus didn’t, but it got passed down.Christianity became syncretized— more Gentile— by adapting to the Gentiles, as a necessity of spreading the faith.I suspect, once it became dominant, the judaizing started in earnest— ‘true’, ‘pure’, ‘original’ Christianity. It’s complicated LOL.Why I say dump the JQ and become a fully Gentile religion FWIW.

                        I include “apeing” or “caricature” as each tries to mirror the other – it’s a case of identities, that is, who do they identify as in the movie in their mind? The original dominant stock? Its caricature? The caricature of the caricature? The revision, or the revision of the revision?
To further confuse the issue, racial identity. For example, the Elamites were mixed Semitic-Aryan, while the Medes, Persians, and Parthians were dominantly Aryan. Who came first?
We ask the same questions in our multicultural, mixed-race society.  Who marries whom, from where?

                    As that pithy old meme goes, the “Judeo” in Judeochristianity – if Jesus Christ getting nailed to the cross by Romans doing the bidding of jews. Historically Christians understood the nature of the jew as did pretty much everyone else. They got run out of 109 countries because they inevitably attack their hosts and/or allies.Back at Christmas our elders noticed the wave of antisemitism rising and got up there to pound the lectern and bloviate about how Jesus was a jew, how EVERYONE sinned in the crucifixion, blah blah blah. The older crowd bought it (with the exception of me) but the youngsters looked back with condescending expressions or obvious contempt.It’ll be awhile but the wheels are coming off judeochristianity too.

I would love someone to tell me how the system has changed since then. One group went down for being honest about “only following orders…” but that did not change anything for subsequent generations of enforcers.
Same paymasters. Same badged/uniformed enforcers.

                        I used to do that too, when I worshipped them as the light.
One Texan at the next table leaned over and said, “Those Jews sure made a mistake, didn’t they?”
I said, “This is what they were made to do. Through victory and defeat, they were forged, made strong enough to do what had to be done- strong enough to kill God, fulfilling His will.”
I thought I was being very rabbinical and clever.

                    In the big picture, the societal impact of Jews and Muslims living among Whites is not a good fit.  Whites are high-trust, relatively not ethnocentric and tend to get taken advantage of by these groups.  Whites are designed for a world of their own, to borrow a phrase from Tim Murdock.
In the small details, you might be friends with specific Jewish or Muslim people, but zooming out, big picture, they don’t belong in the West.

                        A good example of our cultural miscalculation is demonstrated in the latest fooferal: people say if you kill the Ayatollah or the IRGC mob bosses, someone else will just pop up and take their place.No, not in the Middle East. We train our soldiers to be “one man armies”. They jealously hoard information, skills, or knowledge. The last thing you’d do is train your replacement, where that is the first thing we’d do, and we love doing it.The author of the article explaining this said the American would go down the line giving each man a manual, the Arab would come along behind him taking them back.There was no second Saddam. If you kill the Islamist mobsters, you kill the regime. The Iranian diaspora are on fire right now, they absolutely hate these bastards – our media has studiously ignored their frequent and very public brutality.(The right is too busy swallowing Leftist tropes, because we are conditioned to act like whipped dogs.)Now, think of the Beltway, or our ruling institutions. There is a vicious fight to keep Jews at the top – Harvard, for example. B’s hire D’s. Information and secrets are the coin of the realm.Should we remember who we are – one can say “Christian, not Jew” or better yet, “with Greco-Roman roots” –roots, not a jewish root – then we know we are a seperate people from that strange tribe that would rule us. They are not Jewish, but they have jewish roots.We’re the American sons and daughters of Europe – and they are not.  They belong to another tribe now.

                Couple of issues. First, even if whites continued their love affair with Israel (not likely), whites will soon be at best 50% of the population. The other half is, at best, indifferent to Jews and, generally, hostile.Demographics is working against Ashkenazi Jews both in Israel and in the US and Europe.Second, in the future, the US simply won’t be capable to helping Israel to anything near what we can do now. Our military is fading. Also, missile technology is leveling the playing field. If Iran wasn’t so stubborn, they could have had a lot better and deeper air defense systems in place. Even with what they had, we were very wary of taking them on.Obviously, Israel knows this, which is why they were so intent on causing a war now. But they missed their chance.

                    True, so it will be interesting to see upon whom the mantle of attack-dog-for-the-money-power falls. IF that turns out to be necessary after they have forced us into a cashless economy, which is another facet of this whole thing.
And they WILL force us into that, if only for a while.

                    The browning of America won’t hurt Jewish power. Even Muslims, since they are here for the gibs and the better lifestyle go along. All you have to do is look at the gulf nations. Their populations hate israel but that doesn’t stop the governments from cooperating with israel while pretending to care about the Palestinians.
The threat to Jewish power may come from Chinese and Indian competition. However, no matter how much they compete for the levers of power, Chinese and Indians will support Israel for peace with the Jews.

                It warms my heart to hear so many of our people questioning the “wisdom” of granting dual citizenship (*dueling loyalties* at very best) to these people and others as well. It’s been one of my pet peeves (along with “birthright citizenship” and “enumeration at birth”) for over 25 years.

                    I am a dual national (EU) and no longer live in the USA, 27 years now. I last voted in the USA (living there at the time) for Pat Buchannan in ’96, thereafter stopped voting because I no longer had skin in the game, so to speak, save for economic “rent” I derive from there. This should be the case for nearly all dual nationals and under no circumstances should a dual national be in government in the USA.

                It’s not important if white Americans are antisemites or not. Just like it’s not important if white Americans like or loathe Congo pygmies. Yes it would be weird and unfair if they hated jungle pygmies bit that’s not a central trait either way. One should never put a different people at the center of one’s own people.

                I’m not a believer in “luxury beliefs.” It’s an imaginable thing, but I don’t think the concept fits any real-world phenomenon.What’s observable is the American religion: absolute belief in the absolute righteousness of money. Whoever’s richer than you is smarter than you, more moral, more favored by God,more American. So they can do whatever they want, pitch a genocide and make you pay for it, rape and mutilate your children, spend all day on Twitter high on taxpayer-funded drugs bragging about dispossessing your race—whatever.If it were wrong, they’d be poor.If you object, you contradict the manifest will of God, which is money.Jews not only have money butbanks. Theydefinemoney—and morality. Our sacrifice to them will continue until it’s total, until they have everything and we’re all dead. The more it hurts us, the more we’llforce it. The more little boys’ dicks they saw off, the more we’ll blame anime girls—like Africans with their “penis-stealing witches.” Etc. We will not andcannotrecognize the problem and recover from it. Itisus.And they know it, and they say it, and we revel in it.

                        Jeez. As Geese said, the Church of Mammon, the High Church of the Almighty Dollar, amen.
And we wondered why the Puritan Yankees hated the South, were determined to impose their penny-pinching upon them. They looked down upon a people who were dirt poor, who weren’t on fire to pollute and degrade and overturn in order to change that.  Where was their revolutionary fervor?
They saw a people who were content: they had their traditions, worth more to them than money.

Excellent summation.  I have always thought that reaching this point represents the complete Judaization of America, which was always their goal.  Honor, discipline and especially sacrifice hold no position in the collective American mind, only selfishness, greed and cunning in the pursuit of mammon.

                    “What is the secular basis of Judaism?Practicalneed,self-interest. What is the worldly religion of the Jew?Huckstering. What is his worldly God?Money..…The Jew has emancipated himself in a Jewish manner, not only because he has acquired financial power, but also because, through him and also apart from him,moneyhas become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations. The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews.…in North America, the practical domination of Judaism over the Christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that thepreaching of the Gospelitself and the Christian ministry have become articles of trade, and the bankrupt trader deals in the Gospel just as the Gospel preacher who has become rich goes in for business deals…”-Karl Marx,On the Jewish Question

                I’m a “White American” (but also a dual national: EU), born in NYC six weeks after Trump, but on the other side of Manhattan’s 59th Street bridge, an “unbridgeable” gap. Mr. T is Queens County all the way down: crude; loud-mouthed, vulgar; uncultured; oafish; very mercenary and overly pretentious with respect to the more polished non-jewish folk on the other side of the East River. It’s a narcissistic wound that simply won’t heal and never will.I believe the above is no small indicator of why Mr. T has gone the way he has. A university course I remember well was taught by Donald Kagan (r.i.p.), thepater familiasof the iconic neo-con family, on the origins of war. He was a worthy professor. While explaining the cause of WWI, he mentioned the Kaiser’s withered arm and his resentment against his royal cousins, a resentment that led him to build a navy that could challenge his Brit cousin’s, a provocation as seen by the genocidal occupiers of Ireland. A Marxist student challenged Professor K and his response was “Crap.” He then explained to the jewess that “You’ve never been a six year old boy fighting for his pennies in the playground”. Every male in the room nodded affirmatively.Back in the day, the only Manhattanites who accepted Mr. T were the wealthy Jews, spearheaded by Roy Cohn, who sat in our living room with RFK, Sr., to discuss the communist menace with my father and a friend who was a McCarthy committee investigator. When they left, my father disparaged Mr. T’s mentor Mr. C as a “sleazy homo”, which indeed he was.Mr. T allied himself with those who could best help him in his sleazy business dealings and continues to help them now with much worse. Mr. T may have been born an “American”, but he is in fact a very “provincial” NYer, albeit from NY’s “B-side”. Those who believe his interest and advocacy goes much beyond Westchester County in the “heartland” are kidding themselves. If you’re not a “friend” of the late Rabbi Schneerson, you ain’t shit to Mr. T and neither is what remains of the late, lamented “Heritage America”.

            To certain personality types, Dispensationalism and the Schofield Heresy appear to be as addictive as Crack Cocaine.The Council of the Sanhedrin certainly hit paydirt when they authorized the Frankfurt School to create and deploy Dispensationalism plus Schofield.I hate to say this, but my fear is that these pseudo-religious emotional fixations &amp; obsessions are almost certainly being fed by CLUSTER-B, and in the modern world, we seem to have a nearly infinite supply of CLUSTER-B, which means the Council of the Sanhedrin could [at least in theory] continue to mine the psycho-sociological vein of CLUSTER-B to authorize d@mned near infinitely many Psy-Ops of this nature .[Blessed are the Meek, for They shall inherit the Earth…]

                Mass media combined with the apparently very low capacity for critical thought and high susceptibility to propaganda of the average person, means that democracy will always end up as a system controlled by those who are both wealthyandorganized. This means corporations and the ultra-rich. The best one could hope for was to ally oneself with one of these wealthy factions and try to get a slice of the crooked pie.The people controlling the system used to allow ordinary White Americans, especially if they were smart and had useful skills, to get a slice of this pie. Think of all those well paid “defense” workers sitting at desks at Lockheed or Grumman. Now that they’ve decided on our wholesale replacement, we can only regard them as deadly enemies.

These are the tools they have, this is the war they’ll fight. It is very different from our own, but the young ones are not backing down. They are adapting and innovating, and increasingly fierce. Theirs is a strange note of confidence in contrast to our own defeatism.

            Depends on what you mean by “Zionism”. I used to be staunchly anti-Zionist until I started reading some late 19th century Brits who took a decidedly Mencken-ish approach — give ’em what they want, good and hard. Let them have a homeland somewhere, anywhere other than here, then, once they have a homeland, kick them out of our homeland. As forcefully as necessary.

            Agreed.  But, its a pretty accurate approximation of how those people view themselves.Most of my family is Evangelical Protestant of one kind or another and they all fall for, or are at least sympathetic to, the “Those who bless Israel will be blessed and those who curse Israel will be cursed” misquoting of scripture..  Being Boomers, we also grew up with the Holocaust mythology and identification with the plucky Israeli “cowboys” fighting the primitive heathen Arab “Indians”.  That and the use of the same words Israel and Jews in the Bible and for the modern state and people continues to give them status as the “Chosen People”.   As a Christian, I accept that term, but with all the prophet’s admonitions as well.The issue of war on behalf of the State of Israel is tearing at our family bonds.  One brother, a Marine veteran, is rabidly pro-Israel and unleashes his rage on me for refusal to parrot his pro-Israel, anti-Arab, anti-Persian and anti-Russian vitriol.  He is currently on a text message campaign to get folks to support Israeli companies.  I let him know that Sbarro’s  cheese on cardboard is actually not Israeli, but that he can buy Sabra products for an Israeli take on Lebanese food.  I could suggest  PornHub as another way to support Israel, but I don’t want to scandalize my sisters.  Just to piss him off, I tell him I make my contribution to Israel through payroll deduction.

                    I think that “Christian Zionism” is  complete bullshit and based on an intentional misreading of the totality of Holy Scripture and the Church’s tradition.     Like the ZMan, I have friendly relations, even close relations, with lots of individual Jews (none are very religious and the religious tend towards Christianity)  The pro-Israel family members are less travelled and have locally centered lives, but I am not criticizing that.  They seem to view Jews as some kind of magic people and are susceptible to the “Christian” hucksters who sell the magic formula “give allegiance and money to Israel (people and the Zionist entity) and God will bless you.”  Makes me want to retch

                ” . . .  use of the same words Israel and Jews in the Bible and for the modern state and people continues to give them status as the “Chosen People”. As a Christian, I accept that term, but with all the prophet’s . . .   .”I don’t quite follow your train of thought there, but will just point out that the Jews of today are NOT the Jews of the Bible. They were wiped out in 70 A.D. by Titus, using the usual Roman methods of putting down revolts. TheJews were killed (practically all of them) or sold into slavery(children and some women), and Jerusalem was utterly destroyed. The Christian population, remembering Christ’s specific warning (Luke 21:20;Matthew 24:15-22 and Mark 13: 14-20)fled to Idumea and thus survived. (As an interesting aside–to those interested in ancient history or in so-called “revisionist” history–is the story of the Emperor Constantine’s mother’s pilgrimage to Jerusalem in the 4th century in search of the True Cross. She is today St. Helena. When she got there and asked the bishop of Jerusalem to take her to Calvary and to the tomb of Jesus, he told her that the Romans had destroyed the city and that the city we know today as Jerusalem was built after 70 A.D. and was a few miles distant, and that’s where he took her.)There are books–by today’s “Jews”–that go into this, one of which isThe Invention of the Jewish Peopleby Shlomo Sand, was widely acclaimed when published.Anyway, today’s Jews are NOT the Jews of the Bible and therefore cannot be “chosen” by God. They ARE, however, chosen by the Money Power that rules the world as their attack dog and permanent (?) foothold in the resource-rich region.

            “…the irony of the NYC Mayoral primary result…”
There are nuances to be sure, but really not unexpected from demographics.  NYC is now 30% White.  Cuomo is thearchetypicalWhite candidate.  It would take a fluke to get him into the Mayor’s office.  There will be no more Whites elected through the standard political process we once knew in NYC.

                    Most of the time, politicians are members of the party that can get them elected. For instance, if Newsom was a Texan he’d be a Republican, and if Cruz a Californian he’d be a Democrat. Following that, does this trend inevitably lead to a day when more white baizuo pols become Republicans, since they have no chance of getting elected any other way? Making the GOP even more useless than it already is. I see this as more likely than the baizuo undergoing some kind of ideological conversion.

        Politicians want job security and they know that going against Israel will be the end of their political career. Christian Zionists are just plain stupid. It’s frustrating having a conversation with them because of their ignorance. Most cannot find Israel on a map and know anything about it’s modern history. Ted Cruz looks like a combination of both.

        Great essay Z-Man.The Cruz interview was a great first look into the depth of the corruption and depravity of elected representatives. Cruz is the worst example because he is genuinely gifted. His savaging of Katanjikoko String-Of-Last-Names was very impressive. Even that you had the sense it was all theatre. He was showing the base that he is anti-woke. However, if it was serious, and the Senate were serious, they would have never voted to approve her appointment as it was/is a threat to our civilization.The Roman Senate murdered Caesar because he was a threat to them. In this unserious, decadent farce of a flea circus, there are no stakes. Clearly Cruz didn’t see that woman as a threat. And why would he. She is married to a Boston Brahmin. She is the system even as she moves to destroy the civilization that the System is designed to destroy.Bedfellows in a performative act.As for the Tucker bit, that was even more illuminating. I got the sense that Cruz was not defending Israel as much as he was defending his deep corruption. He is so bought and paid for that insinuating Tucker as anti-Jew and anti-semite was done to get Tucker off of the scent of a deep and insane corruption that Tucker smelled at the very entrance of the cave.I’ll never forget that video of Eyepatch Dan being hounded by one of these Internet reporter goofs, hounding him on his way up the steps to Congress. Crenshaw had 4 smoking hot staffers surrounding him – all of whom were dressed like cheap hookers he had just picked up at a Vegas porn awards show. As the reporter kept at him, Crenshaw pushed him to the ground and then flexed by walking over him. Crenshaw had a villainous smile on his face.We should all be grateful for Tucker. We sit here and type and whine, but he is going after some extremely corrupt people who have a lot of power and will do anything to keep it so that they can continue looting and keep that entourage of, “staffers”, in stilettos coming back for more. Cruz reeks. He exposed himself for what he is and it can’t be unseen. Tucker is risking his life doing what he is doing.It is likely that it will turn out that the Republicans are far more corrupt than the Democrats ever were. The Democrats have principles and they have aims and they have a constituency they serve that is honest. Blacks built a middle class from their patronage. Pajeets built hotel and now tech empires from their patronage. White liberal females get guilt free abortions, sex changes, moral sanctimony and laptop jobs from their patronage.Republicans have never given anything to their voters. In fact, they have been selling them out and dispossessing them since the late 1930s. AOC corrupt? Probably. But she has nothing on Lindsey Graham, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Dan Crenshaw and others.Every day it becomes more obvious to more people that we are on our own and we need to put our own up or we are finished.

            What was shocking about Lyin’ Ted was that he was totally unprepared for Carlson, not even knowing the population size and population pyramid. For example, Iran’s most sizeable male cohort is between 38 and 36, a severe drop off to 24-18, if you take Wikipedia’s chart at face value.Which means young men are few in number, any major military mobilization will hit men in their late thirties as that is the biggest male age group. Meaning as time goes on Iran’s leaders will have less and less ability to do the sorts of things they can do now: lob missiles at Israel to maintain ruling class cohesion. Just for laughs I checked Russia’s on Wikipedia. If I am reading the chart right, Russia has the same shape of men available just a few years older. Which has shaped Putin’s military policy. Putin has not mass mobilized because he can’t — there just are not enough young men to do that.This is the demographic age.

        It reminds me of a couple of comments I heard from Ted Kennedy later in his life that left me with the impression he thought if he gave away as much of other rich people’s money to the poor as possible it would absolve him from murdering Mary Jo Kopechne.  The average member of Congress has been bombarded with WWII propaganda their entire life.  It could be that many of them convince themselves if they are faithful on this one issue it will make up for all the self dealing they have done.

                    If Graham isn’t eager, he sure does a good job of pretending that he is. I know that the good looking actors go to Hollywood (or used to), and the ugly ones go to DC, but Graham’s enthusiasm for the cause makes it seem like any blackmail on him is just insurance, rather than his main motivation.

        There is another possible explanation. It could be that AINO’s white elites–including T. Cruz–view Jews as a superior people. Their vast wealth and flashy GRE scores say so. For two different classes of whites–Grillers and Spiteful Mutants–it is LeBoon James’ box scores and the thrilling criminality, respectively, of the negroes, that signify Porch Monkey superiority.
I’m afraid we are a psychologically warped and damaged people who worship the fiends most dedicated to our dispossession and subjugation.

            This is the sad place where I have arrived, Ostei.
Just as genetics mean that Sub-Saharan Africans never will overcome their propensity for violence and low intelligence, and Jews never will shake off their predatory sociopathy and assimilate into Western societies, whites are too biologically wired for suicidal behavior to survive over the long haul unless their is a massive cull of their population. Both prongs of the Judeo-Puritan overclass carry the seeds of their own destruction, different in nature but equally deadly, and it is dubious blacks can maintain even the rough ruins of white society.

                This is WAY too gloomy. I don’t think this is true of the majority, just the spiteful mutants who are at most 20% of our population. There are two patterns that make up a human being genetics (hardware) and memetics (software). The spiteful mutants have broken hardware and are thus easy for the transnational to manipulate.The rest are herd beasts, as are we all, and get stampeded. Normal white people are like are like horses being asked to charge blindly into a wall of pikes. We are starting to wake up.I’ll also throw this out: at least a lot of the spiteful mutants are anti-Semites. They may be broken shites, but at least many of them still have the pattern recognition capability to recognize OTHER broken shites. Let’s be clear, the specials are a transnational tribe of spiteful mutants.

            A good bit of truth to that. But oddly enough, the Shoah mythopeia didn’t commence in 1946. It took another 15 to 20 years before America’s popular culture and its educational apparatus began promulgating the idea that the Holocaust wastheuniquely evil event of human history, that white Americans were somewhat complicit, and that they owed eternal restitution to the Jews. In other words, the centrality of the Shoah to America’s master narrative didn’t manifest until Leftists–many of whom were Jewish–colonized the country’s institutions.

        Even normie grillers are starting to ask just why this country’s media and government care so much about Israel and the Jews. I mean, I have a lot of reasonably well-off friends, and literally none of them ever took a trip to Israel. I have never heard any of them say Israel is on their bucket list. Yet every single politician and member of the media says Israel is their favorite country and they have been there 33 times each. It’s hard not to notice, and once you notice, you can’t not notice. There’s a reason why the Muslim communist who said he would stay in NYC instead of go to Israel won the election, and that is horrifying the usual crowd. They realize the spell is broken.

        Even more salient than corruption is blackmail. Every new politician arriving in DC gets invited to a series of carefully curated cocktail parties in which they are surreptitiously drugged and then put into a compromising situation involving underage children and photographed or videoed. Most are largely unconscious during these staged events, but a few become willing participants. And everyone knows who is behind these blackmail ops. Blackmail is far more powerful than simple greed.

            Look, I’m not going to say this doesn’t happen, but the system selections for these people well before they get anywhere near DC. I guess occasionally someone can slip through the net but the system is very good at using the carrot to get these people to play along. See Ocasio-Cortez – I don’t think they needed to blackmail her, just show her the good stuff that awaits her if she plays ball. And sure enough she is Pelosi’s shadow.The system will pick people who are ruthless and conniving and willing to play ball to get there, or people who are dumb and can be molded into what the system wants. They don’t need to blackmail either of these.

                Never forget that Epstein ran his OP for over a quarter century and he was the successor to Maxwell, who started in the 1950s. And there were/are others not yet known in the public domain. All of that reflects serious long term financing and effort. You don’t do that for the occasional oddball politician, you do that for systemic effect.

                    Obviously, this is a huge operation. I think the SFPD once uncovered massive domestic spying by the ADL and it all got swept under the rug. I guess my point is that they don’t need to put, like, Don Bacon tier politicians on the Lolita Express and blackmail them – these types are happy to do the work for the 30 pieces of silver they offer them. Maybe you did in 1970 when these guys still had some loyalty to their own people and their own constituents but that faded long ago. At some point the system perpetuates itself and these hardball tactics can fade into the background.

                        My point is that the Zionists are hardcore pros when it comes to doing evil. Blackmail via pedophile trap is child’s play compared to genocide and assassination, but they employ it nonetheless with cold-blooded vigor and determination. Do not underestimate them. To do so will get you dead not imprisoned.

        “The Israel lobby has been one of the most fearsome advocacy groups in America for a long time. Men like Joe Sobran and Pat Buchanan questioned their influence and were then run out of town for the crime of mentioning the Israel lobby.”That was then, this is now. The internet has empowered those of us who have different views on this subject. In fact, I think politicians got a rude awakening last week that the American people have moved on from having a fixation on Israel. If anything, the incompetent and insane misuse of our military power is turning more and more people against the prevailing Washington way of looking at things.The other funny thing is that local politicians don’t go through this charade. Nobody at the local level professes love for Israel or for the Jews when they are running for office. Of course, the local government doesn’t have a military at its disposal, but I think it helps illustrate how detached the people in DC are from the rest of the country.

        This is a great short little video for everybody to watch. It’s a New York mayoral debate clip where everybody is pledging their love for Israel except for the socialist. The video is hilarious just because it shows how all these people have “jumped the shark” as they say. Zohran is a breath of fresh air compared to the rest of them.

                Yes, Zohran is not our friend, and while exit polls are lacking, it seems he had strong support in White and fellow-White neighborhoods in the city. I am not really sure what to make of this outside of virtue signaling and savior complex. I doubt any of these people in Park Slope or the UES will be going to the government grocery stores or taking the now-free buses. NYC is so far afield of the trends going on in the rest of the country, except for one thing – the thing that is the topic of Z’s post today.

                    Yes. These Whites are so consumed by their striving that they are the most strident worshipers of diversity. They have wholly bought into it. Now, they ones they worship to keep their place or keep the next ladder rung open for them, don’t buy in.
They are dancing late in the night at the cult party and have no idea that the whites of eyes peering out at them, are the eyes of their pets whose knives are hiding in the shadows.

                I was more focused on the fact that all but Zohran were fixated on Israel, but point taken. I mean it’s surreal that they’re all babbling about an insignificant little country, like they are making a ritual visit to see Pope Bibi.

            The reaction video of his victory party is revealing. Most prevalent: mid 4s White women (if that). Second most: White gays. Third: men of unknown and dubious ethnic origin. That seems to be his coaltion. Turnout was supposedly very low. Lots of REITs are tanking, Wall Street seems to be in panic “lets move to Palm Beach” mode and DeSantis is urging them all to move NOW.What I did NOT see: any blacks. Any Dominicans (can’t miss em). Any Puerto Ricans. Not sure how “real” this victory is, if the dude gets squashed in the General Election by some “independent” with limitless Wall Street Money and appeal to blacks/hispanics who outnumber Whites something like 2.5 to one.Victory party video is on Instanormie. For those interested.

        Another angle to this is the fact so many of our politicians are deviants &amp; are extremely easy to blackmail, it just so happens that israel specializes in that sort of thing. Not only that they have full access to the massive NSA database &amp; if that’s not enough the mossad is well known for assassinations &amp; false flag terror plots.They get caught spying on us &amp; our politicians constantly, they sell our trade secrets to our enemies &amp; break foreign policy agreements without a care in the world because nothing happens to them. They blew up a navy ship &amp; got caught planting bombs for a false flag terror attack in Egypt &amp; the end result was getting financially rewarded with billions of dollars every year forever. That’s to say nothing of the assassinations &amp; terrorism they committed leading up to the founding of israel.Name any other group of people who can send a letter bomb to a sitting US president &amp; not only incur zero repercussions for it but also have it covered up, you can’t. Nobody else gets treated this way.

        White evangelicals will not call Washington DC on behalf of themselves and their race but they will call Washington DC if their holy nation Israel needs help. After all Jesus is coming back to the Holy Land and Jerusalem and all will be saved including the ones leveling Gaza with bombs and sending assassins to Iran right now.The evangelicals played a large role in electing George Bush Jr and while they may have diminished a little bit in their influence they have helped create the Rupert Murdock foreign policy propoganda machine for our best buds who keep getting us into hot water.Much like the crusades and the christians who thought a piece of real estate being held by unbelievers was anathema 1000 years ago and caused untold wealth destruction and unnecessary blood shed, the modern battle over a piece of real estate today called the Holy Land and a people occupying it who are influencing a much larger christian nation to shed blood and money for the Zionist cause, its all kinda similar and will end in disaster.The Israel of God is now the Church whom inherited the promises of Abraham, spiritual promises, not a piece of real estate in the middle east, that part is finished.

        “This is not a new thing. It has always been assumed that Washington loves Israel because Israel pays cash for its politicians and there is nothing a politician loves more than cash, except maybe the person handing him the cash.”It’s a carrot-and-stick approach. The carrot is campaign contributions and freebies like paid trips to Israel. The stick is that anyone going against Zionist diktat will find his reputation besmirched and his seat in the House of Representatives or Senate challenged at the next election by an amply-funded opponent. Every person in the House and Senate has his own Israeli minder to make sure he or she stays in line. Congressmen live under this Sword of Damocles.What’s of interest is the way these people have infiltrated the US economy and urban society over several decades. I don’t know whether theProtocols of Zionis authentic or not but it matters nowt– something like this has been the long-term master plan. Goyim now exist as helots.That includes Trump.“Another culprit is Dispensationalism, which is a madhouse collection of crackpot ideas loosely based inthe uneducated reading of Scripture.”Well, what to say? This is Protestantism, going back to Luther and Calvin and the printing press. If you want exegetical reading, you have to drift towards Catholic theology, which has developed slowly and gradually over the last two millennia.“While it is risky to oppose the Israel lobby, no politician risks anything by ignoring the Christian Zionist voters or any voting bloc.”The Christian Zionist goyim are Israel’s useful idiots. They’re the sheep in Orwell’s Animal Farm, who keep repeating “Four legs good, two legs bad”, until one day they start chanting “Four legs good, two legs better.” They can be taught to mindlessly repeat whatever slogan the Israel lobby wants — “Well, Israel has the right to defend itself.”“Washington is deep into the racket stage of imperial decline, which means everyone inside Washington looks at the political system in the same way the locals look at the Walmart in a ghetto riot.”Yep. Grab what you can and the devil take the hindmost.

        The current Israel is not the Ancient Israel. Israel is not a theocracy, the religion is divided, it does not completely control it’s land, it is secularly led and there is no longer a Temple. American politicians are not only ignorant they are superstitious as well.

        Bit of a tangent but … the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their true names.  And, you know they’re winning when we use their language.  In this case, you used “lobbying” when perhaps a better word is “bribery”.  If I had a voice, I’d start a campaign!  After all, absent the political context, where did the euphemism “lobby” come from?Yet another tangent, for years, you’ve talked about “moral” in the establishment’s constant virtue signalling.  I smile because the word “antimoral” immediately comes to mind as your true meaning.  Most of us think of morality as a spectrum between good and evil. What of the morality those who’s purpose of pretending virtue is to cover evil intent and action?Does that concept even fit with explaining bribery?

        everyone inside Washington looks at the political system in the same way the locals look at the Walmart in a ghetto riot. There is no higher purpose to the life of the politician, as he is just a vehicle for pillaging what remains of the white middle-class and the old America they represent.Some years back, Britain had a expense-scandal, where one parliamentarian after another was discovered to have cheated outrageously, sometimes comically, with their expese accounts, with one having the moat of his manor house dredged on the public dime, and another having the taxpayer shell out for her husband’s porn habit.Some pundit noted that since their political power was being drained by the overbearing influence of  Brussels and Washtington, plus party dicatorship, grifting was the only activity that made their job make sense.It’s not their religion that’s being hollowed out, it’s their profession. If you’re a carnie and the act you’re given involves the same old tired routines, wearing the same funny hats and taking the same pratfalls, concentrating on your remuneration at least gives you a semblance  of purpose, it allows you to pretend you’re a player.

        I have no particular animus against Jews. Nevertheless, I can’t help but wonder if they’ve ever collectively counted the cumulative cost of placing their own group’s interests ahead of those of their host societies. History says they haven’t. As one (former?) reader here has been know to categorize them: “The least self-aware people in human history.” As time goes by, more and more people Notice, and at some point critical mass is reached and…well, unhappy events transpire.

        I, for one, do love having Old Testament scripture quoted at me by New Testament Christians. As was the case all last week…
It’s like they’re reliving Exodus or something. Very weird.
Totally agree about the second coming. I’ve said for years that you have two death cults pitted against each other. 12th Imam Muslims and Second Coming Christians. Both seem to have grown impatient with God, and are intent on moving things along.
Wont it be interesting if, upon death, we learn that Earth was the Paradise in an infinitely cold and indifferent universe…?

            I don’t think most Shia really believe any more. One of the more disheartening things for Shia Muslims in Iran is the total, and absolute moral corruption of the Mullahs. Every single one of them is on the take, has run the country into the ground, lives a fairly dissolute private life, and stashes great gobs of money with relatives in all sorts of places: the US, Russia, India, Europe, the Bahamas etc. They don’t even bother to hide this also.Sunnis likely most those finding no solace in Europe from American Rap Ghetto culture seem to believe. There seems to be little real belief (Mosque attendance, donations, etc.) in the Gulf as the corruption of the religious authorities is too blatant to coexist with belief. As for the rest of the Sunni outside Europe and the Americas, I don’t know. The general trend with urbanization is atomization and loss of belief for all cultures experiencing it. Something about living in small apartments in dense urban areas tends to break people apart into tiny little units with not much attachment to anything.

        I would say that we are witnessing the clash of two moralities in the West wrt Israel.Ted Cruz fancies himself a good man, because he spends his life fighting the ghost of an Austrian Corporal under his bed. The Corporal did exist, he did do very bad things, he was neither unique nor non-repeating in the scope and manner of his atrocities. But nevertheless, as Christian individual morality collapsed (“I am a good man because I follow Jesus’ teachings, accept him as my savior, and do good things in my life because of his teachings”), the cheap and easy morality of being the hero in the movie of one’s own mind replaced it. The massive documentation that Germans 1933-45 produced, the endless hours of television documentaries in the 1960s and 1970s, the inability to produce a heroic narrative for the West after 1945, all contributed to this new morality of being good by fighting a ghost under the bed. Vladimir Putin for Europeans functions as the new Ghost btw.In inevitable conflict with this public morality is the view of “The White Race is the Cancer upon Human History” per Susan Sontag, and other views of Whites as genetically evil (as shown by the Austrian Corporal) and non-Whites as morally good. Martin Luther King Jr, as “Jesus 2.0, New and Improved black edition” only re-inforced this public morality. The Colors of Benetton, and replacing each and every White male hero with either black, or lesbian, or both variations is part of this public morality. “White Skin bad, black/brown skin good.”The Austrian Fighters tend to be mostly White males, playing out Patton or The Longest Day or Band of Brothers in their heads. The White fighters are mostly AWFLs, convinced they are marching with Dr. Martin Luther King as the heroes of their Pilates class.I see this in my “Neighborhoods” feed (I have a Ring Camera, yes I know it spies on me but I have neither the time nor money nor energy to rig up an open source substitute). The Upper Class White women spend all their time “saving” the little brown ones from ICE, with notifications etc. Its the cheap and easy morality like a Starbucks Latte.Per Paul Kersey on the X Spaces conversation with others including Peter Brimelow and our host, Saturday People found out to their horror that not just AWFLs but non-Whites consider them “super-Whites.” Which is why after 10/7 every anti-White activist group like BLM endorsed the slaughter (which is what it was, objectively). The pro-Hamas stuff is always very White female upper class and non White female.Younger Whites are not really into playing Captain Dick Winters or Patton in the movies of their heads. They’ve been called the bad guys all their lives, so playing the hero rescuing someone is not in the cards. They have a second assessment of guys like Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, and other men of action they can relate to; farther in time removed but more akin to their attitudes.The first public morality is dying out, as one cannot play the hero when society casts one as the villain, because of skin color and sexual orientation. Its simply not possible. The second morality is limited to non-Whites and AWFLs, the latter a function of their sexual resentment at settling for men as average as themselves, in honesty. Neither can scale outside their in-groups and motivate young White men. They remain open to a new morality that accomodates their hatred by their own women and various non-White rivals (which is all of non-Whites).

                My point is the moral code of “being a good person” by fighting the ghost of AH under your bed appeals to boomerish White men. And is conflict with the moral code of “being a good person” by fighting “Super Whites” aka Jews, first, ordinary Whites second.
That the moral battles are mostly being fought by boomer dad types like Lyin’ Ted, vs. AWFLs various women of color like AOC.
No younger White men involved. Hope that helps.

            Zuluis on point: the other colours are simply jealous … envious, wishing they could be white. Unfortunately, they are also NOT Traditonal Catholics for then they woulkd understand that, while we are all created in God’s image, secular history (aka satan) — ALL of the various Sins to which mankind is prone — has intervened and brought us to this point in time.

        I think Trump strongly implied in his “They don’t know what the fuck they are doing” speech that the US shot down an Israeli rocket targeting Iran. So, we will shoot down more than Iran’s rockets, which we probably shot down a whole ot of them during this conflict. That’s a new paradigm.

                It’s open to interpretation but I think there is a good chance he was talking about the US shooting down a rocket Israel fired, and he said “they said it was a mistake”. He could have been talking about Iran, but I got a suspicion that he was talking about Israel.

        The rest are in seats held by one party of the other in perpetuity, so they have no reason to fear the voters.
I’d argue the reverse of this, just ask Rep. Liz Cheney or Mayor Cuomo. The 90/10 districts allow the base to demand the candidates they want. It’s the 55/45 districts that force voters to abandon the candidates they want in favor of candidates “that can win.”

            Liz Cheyney was operating under an old paradigm where she thought she just needed to game the primary system once and it would work forever no matter what she said or how she voted. Some pols, like Lindsay Graham can pull this off, but she was openly antagonistic to Wyoming Republicans. It also hurt her that she wasn’t really from the state.Democrats have more of a racial headcount issue to deal with.  White men really don’t have options left there as they have driven out voters who would have been more comfortable voting for someone who looks like them.  Cuomo was left chasing after older blacks who wanted someone competent at handing out gibs in office.

        Bethlehem was 85% Christian until 1948.Today, it’s 12%.
Beware the pilpul of anti-Christians who present Islam as a viable alternative “because they respect Jesus.”
No, the mishmash we call Islam began as Macabbees who thought they could ride the “prophet Jesus as an avenging Jewish warrior” back into power.

        Rather OT, but of interest to some perhaps, is the way Sanctions can help cement a Regime’s hold on power by giving out goodies to connected players.The FT (sometimes does good reporting) a number of years ago did a series on how Assad was able (before large scale Russian intervention) cling to power by sanctions making who gets the smuggling operations (both ways) very lucrative. For example one of his cousins ran a huge copper fixture export business, would scavenge ruined buildings for wire and export it via smuggling operations to Turkey, Greece, and other nations for chash.Libya maintains its warlord control by a more sophisticated deal. Gasoline and Diesel are smuggled in, and exhanged for crude oil. The fuel is mostly then re-exported, with a bit sold in Libyan markets. The Warlords pocket the cash. Mexico, same thing. Fuel is smuggled in, and sold on the Mexican black markets for cash. Most of the fuel comes from the US and Texas specifically. [Fuel is heavily taxed in Mexico]. The Cartels run the black markets, it is apparently a big source of income.This is why the FT reported that Russian business does not want Sanctions lifted. They not only took over places like McDonalds, but get a lot of money smugging stuff in and out. Iran is likely the same way, and both China and India do a good bit of business buying Iranian crude, refining it, and then reselling it elsehwere.

        One of the many strange things to come out of the short war between Israel and Iran is the fact that many of our politicians seem to worship Jewish people.That’s a human universal. Within non-Christian German tribes, what the big shots had agreed on was viewed (and certainly called) as being “God’s will”: should any ones have opposed it, that’d have made them into God’s opposers, deserving of all that someone or some ones working against God would, obviously, be deserving of.In Christian parishes, most people revere the priest or pastor as a god — not a God in fact, but neither a bare human. For the only reason that, within that microcosm, the priest or pastor is the hiearchical top. their cognitive processes and moral judgments will be skewed radically: this is why priests, pastors, and analogous religious authorities of every other religious faith in the world can, for one, do sexual harassment and abuse, including on teens and little boys and girls, for many years, targeting many victims, and as a rule the whole thing never goes public, always is glossed over — while someone not seen as an authority would risk being lynched for a single instance of the same harassment or abuse.Since the neurotypical human mind is geared away from truth and objectivity, and towards self-preservation and status climbing, and what it really has faith in is this world and life in this world (as opposed to the next life, in the next world), whatever is instrumental to self-preservation, and status gaining, becomes that which is holy to such a mind; power is God — those with power are the clergy such a mind will revere, rationalizing it as it needs to for his own comfort, but unconditionally, and “without limits”.Add to that that such a faith/worship is professed in public to a degree surpassing the real, inward-held, faith/worship, as the public dimension sees the addition of a “virtue signalling” ulterior driver: not sincere, but performed fervently.

        Another culprit is Dispensationalism, which is a madhouse collection of crackpot ideas loosely based in the uneducated reading of Scripture


what part of “the Holy Ghost inspires each individual to interpret scripture on their own “ don’t you understand?!?!
