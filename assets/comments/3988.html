        I think it was probably Anthony Daniels who first pointed out to me (not personally, of course, and I should point out that I myself haven’t had an original thought since 1973) that in the old days the lower orders aped their betters- nowadays the elites ape the lower orders.  Go to a public school sometime (disclosure: I’m a public school teacher)- a good one with a low percentage of NAMS- first look at how the kids are dressed- gym shorts, sweats, club wear (what I call the “cheap trashy slut look”). Now look at the teachers- very few ties and coats (never coats) on the men; the women are marginally better dressed, but I think that’s true outside schools. Sad to see, really. I should add that I like the kids I teach, and mostly like my colleagues, but we often look like bums! As the man said- we are doomed.

        Revolt of the Elites, by Christopher Lasch. Essentially, around the time of JFK, a certain percentage of the elites decided they were tired of the old rules, i.e., keeping up appearances of belief in a Christian God and Christian rules. They were tired of the morality, not just the sexual morality, and decided to stop playing. They had money and power and they were going to enjoy it. Another group decided to keep the sense of noblesse oblige and public stoicism,and were subjected to charges of hypocrisy. And this is one of the big divides in the cultural war.I think Lasch was onto something …

        UKer, in the US, what you describe is called “riot insurance” by crimethinkers. It’s certainly not a new thing. The Romans used games to pacify the rabble, along with free grain.

        You mentioned the working class descending into the underclass, and I would like to comment from the UK.I had relatives who worked for a time for the social services and they used to oversee, among other things, the giving of freebies to the non-working. But as the world we live in is as it is, they were handing out things not just to sustain the non-workers but to entertain them. The rapidly developing underclass demanded PlayStations and the like because there was no work for them, but as they didn’t have to work they didn’t need to look for a job and could stay home all day watching TV and playing games while sat around in their underclothes because they could afford (as the state paid for it all) to have the central heating at full blast.The underclass spawned itself. I even had student when teaching who told me he had his future worked out. He claimed he would get a girl pregnant (didn’t matter who) then move into the free home she would get for being an unmarried mother and then kick the girl down the stairs so she lost the baby and they would continue to live in the free house. I have to admit this young man was a complete waste of space and oxygen and I seriously doubt he would even begin to do the things he said he was planning. Like so many of his generation, it was all about bragging and lying and being seen to be ‘cool.’ I hasten to add I never saw him as ‘cool’ in any way, but I have no doubt the state now pays for his upkeep.As a mate of mine said, the only time people like him could expect a job would be in wartime making things because the real men were away fighting. We no longer have the forlorn hope so he couldn’t be cannon fodder.Anyway, my relatives who handed out the free stuff to the underclass were surprised when I told them their job was cheaper than the police. Better to hand out freebies than pay cops to prevent the theft of PlayStations.That is what we are at. The workers once worked here but now there is less and less need and fewer jobs anyway. The government prints money they (we) haven’t got and the jobs base that once paid the taxes to support it all shrinks. The immigrants — who we are told by the Gubmint are no cost burden to the economy despite having ageing relatives needing free medical care and loads of kids needing ‘educating’ — avoid paying tax by making their own arrangements for services where they can. (Another relative of mine worked in a tax office once and they all knew that Mr-I-No-Speak-Inglis if he had say a fast food place would suddenly go bust just before taxes were due to be paid. Amazingly, a brother would take the business over in an instant, but wasn’t responsible for the taxes.)The illusion goes on, and the edges crumble away.

        I ponder this phenomena as I see it a lot in my Midwestern city. I routinely see skuzzy looking white girls tagging along with thoroughly underclass black guys strung out on crack and crime.Is it because the white boys have been de-balled by feminism and absent fathers? Black guys face the fatherlessness on a larger scale and tend to be more feral and violent than neutered. Is it genetics?
