        I knew Cernovich would get a mention in here sooner or later. Get used to his name and funny lisp, he is only getting bigger.I had to laugh at the Fake indian’s Twitter tirade over the weekend. She seems like a silly old woman who has just discovered smart phone technology and is going wild. She is an old-school politician and this is clear to all and sundry. It was cringe-worthy to see her try Trump’s tricks, like a comedian getting caught stealing jokes. In the comment sections, she was destroyed. Her day is gone, time to retire to the teepee.

            Nothing better than being lectured on diversity by an old white woman, standing on the steps of her mansion, while she defrauds people as a fake Indian. You can’t make this stuff up.
As far as Cernovich, I stumbled over him on twitter. He either followed me or someone I follow. I see his tweets all the time now so he is new to me.

        My husband loves CBS, so John Dickerson on one show and Chuck Todd on the other. Dickerson is decent. I know he’s in the tank for the Dems, but he manages to act like a journalist. Chuck Todd simply won’t shut up. He asks a question and then starts interrupting. I’m sure he thinks we’d much rather listen to him.The way the media slants news is so obvious. The problem is that people can’t make the effort to check things out. I had someone on Facebook quote the Democratic talking point “Trump would have made more money if he’d put his inheritance in an index fund.” That is so stupid, I’m surprised people even take it seriously. I spent about two minutes searching, found an article by someone that pointed out the inaccuracies and posted the link on Facebook. I encouraged people there to research whenever they read something like this and to read articles that they disagree with, just to get a different perspective. We had a good discussion why people are supporting Trump, started by someone that really wanted to know.

            In the tank for Dems? Is that “the left”, foreign interests, or Progressives?Certainly not the namesake “democracy”Yes, Todd went to the Chris Mathews school of jurno-list ism when he realized that the revolving doorhad no other way to parlay dedication to the (currently figureheaded) Obama machine into “the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed”.In My Humble Opinion of course.

            See, now that’s what I call “political science”, without the traditional rent-seeker “economist” tassels dangling from the shoes, or nipples.Nothing that hasn’t been covered since Aesop’s Fables and Brothers Grimm mind you, but crisp none the less.

        Trump, and to a lesser extent Sanders, are a genuinely new thing in American politics.  Yeah yeah, I know, Sanders just reheated Eugene V. Debs’s first platform and Trump has no idea what his own positions are, but I’m talking about their grasp of the new reality.  From Jackson forward, plutocrats didn’t have the skill or inclination to hit the campaign trail, so they hired people who did.  But now there’s hardly any “campaign trail” at all.  Plutocrats will be forced to run directly — Soros is too old, but “Zuckerberg / some token chick from Salon or whatever” looks like a winning Dem ticket in 2020.  Watching Zuckerberg and Trump take shots at each other on Twitter instead of “debating” is the future of American politics.  But hey, at least we get to see who we’re **really** voting for…. pass the popcorn.

            Some political scientists, an absurd phrase, argue that we are in the Sixth Party System. Others say this current period is the natural evolution of the Fifth Party System. A better way of thinking about it is the diminishing returns. The first media age was radio that ran from the start of the 20th through WW2. The second media age has been television. Enormous amounts of money have been directed into maximizing the value of television to sell product, polices and political candidates. We probably blew past the point of diminishing returns in the 90’s and maybe even the 80’s.New media has further reduced the returns of television and collapse is beginning to occur.I’ll just note that Ted Cruz is pretty much a fringe candidate, yet he has made it to the last phase based purely on clever use of technology to get votes. He’s Ron Paul with a better quantitative staff. His problem is his message is too narrow and his style is a bad fit for mass media. Still, smart people will be picking over the bones of his campaign for the next time.

                “his style is a bad fit for mass media.”  That’s exactly it.  Make all the Hector Elizondo Mountain Dew Camacho jokes you like — and lord knows I’ve made my share — but Twitter reduces everything to the lowest common denominator.  We’re in a thoroughly demotic age — Cruz seems like a sharp dude, and he’d clean up on the Mugwump ticket, but that’s not the world we live in.

                    Cruz has an honesty problem. Mass media exaggerates the people we see so Cruz often sounds like a super villain, because he does not respect his audience enough to lie to them on their terms. Instead, he has that stupid smirk on his face. It looks like mockery. Trump signals that he respects his audience. People will go along with a lot if they think they are being respected.

                        Cruz is a planner and detail man with, I assume, a planner’s vision. Who knows? He lacks boldness and brevity, which Trump does not.  The juxtaposition of Trump on Cruz left Cruz looking even more officious than before. You cannot lead people by instructing them.

                            Cruz needs to lighten up. He’s way too serious, which speaks to me of self-importance and ego, very bad traits for any human being. Whether he’s a liar or not doesn’t matter to me. All politicians lie. It’s allowed under the Politician’s Code, as long as it advances their career. The rough equivalent in Shia Islam is taqiyya.
