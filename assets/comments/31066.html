        Such riotous fun I’m going to repeat one I left below:
Oh no.Now you’ve simply *got* to watch “White Man’s Burden”, with Belafonte &amp; Travolta.
Africans colonized America.A stupid white janitor, descendant of slaves, is accused of a murder.
The movie starts out with the janitor trying to tell/not tell his kid, no, don’t pick the black Superman toy.

        I remember 1967.  this movie caused  a tremendous uproar.  It was right after the civil rights movement . At the time reasonable people looked at any college freshmen girl marring a dude twice her age that she just met was just silly. I will point out , blacks of the time talked like richard roundtree.  they were named dave and john.  that kind of made the propaganda easier . to sum up the 60’s and 70’s her are 2 short movie clips. to watch .hollywood does DIE:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaCGeQifvdohollywood does whyts:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntC0xJo2bSUyeah the dammage was done then.

            I forgot about the arrow scene.  Interestingly, I’ve never seen a broad head arrow penetrate and stick out of both sides since that movie scene.  A bit of director’s prerogative?  But the bleed out took a believable amount of time.  Deservedly so I’d say.

                    He looked like he was using a compound bow at perhaps 50 feet or so.  I suspect at that range it was pretty powerful.  This State mandates the bow’s power for the particular game.  50 lbs minimum for deer.  The resistance is in penetration. Once the arrow tip leaves the body, it’s pretty much “home free” to drive through and exit..I suppose it could be slowed by going through some bone which would continue to drag along the shaft.  Who knows? But the arrows and bows of today often drive through and the animal barely flinches.  Hence we never move, but wait for the bleed out.  Otherwise you spook them an have a hell of a time tracking them down.

            Brandow Laskow:  Why are there “Israeli Posters” up all over America?  These are not our people.  AINO was not attacked.  The remnants of America do not need Jews and Muslims bringing their disputes to our land.  And neither Jews nor Muslims should be here in the first place.  But, while the odious George W. Bush and others deserve plenty of blame, it has been the Jews who have been agitating for endless immigration and open borders since shortly after the Civil War.

Of course not–and if they really were Americans (you know of the mythical CivNat kind)–they’d leave that shit back home. Ironic isn’t it, by their very behavior they prove they are not Americans and will never be.  Just foreign interlopers looking for a better place to shit in.

            How many posters were torn down? I’ll have a guess – 6 million? And is this the construction worker from the Village People? Joking aside, I’ll agree the poster remover shouldn’t be here. Neither should the people who put them up.

        I forget if I heard this from Ed Dutton, but they were saying that it’s very logical from an evolutionary standpoint why studies show that males of all races show far more resistance to daughters marrying other races. Throughout history, seeing a male of another tribe with one’s own daughter has been symbolic of that tribe conquering your own. I think many here would say it still does. The only difference today is that it’s been done through deception rather than on the battlefield.

            Makes perfect sense. Females are genetic safe bets. If the tribe is conquered they will be enslaved and bred. Males… they lose when they are conquered. This is why women are more pro immigration, they may gain from it if the local bucks aren’t men enough to stop it.
Women are also better at learning new languages. Same logic

                Years ago, someone named Black Pigeon Speaks created a comprehensive video called “Why Women Destroy Nations” in which he covers the Conquered/Traitorous Women phenomenon quite well. Now that women have pretty much taken over the reins of power, the western world is screwed!

            “…seeing a male of another tribe with one’s own daughter has been symbolic of that tribe conquering your own.”
Actually, if geneticists such as David Reich are accurate, it is probably the *last* thing you’ll see.  Reich has written about following population lineage through both male and female DNA.  More than one population replacement he’s studied has shown an abrupt ending of male DNA (being replaced by another male lineage) while the woman’s remains unbroken.  Basically a superior tribe (as you put it) killed all the men of the inferior tribe and then f**ked all the women.  😉

        Its sort of ironic that I mentioned Sidney Poitier yesterday. Which black archetype do you like better:
The goofy lovable black like Louis Armstrong or uncle Remus
Or the urbane educated, and often not raised in America kind of black as embodied by Poitier?

            Krustykurmudgeon: “Its sort of ironic that I mentioned Sidney Poitier yesterday.”I noticed it too, and did some Wiki searching yesterday, and I stumbled upon a fascinating blurb:“…one of the few films of the time to depict an interracial marriage in a positive light, as interracial marriage historically had been illegal in many states of the United States. It was still illegal in 17 states, until June 12, 1967, six months before the film was released, and scenes were filmed just before anti-miscegenation laws were struck down by the Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia.”That strongly suggests [i.e. proves] to me that Abe “Early Life” Fortas was working closely with his ethnic cousin, Stanley “Early Life” Kramer, to coordinate the movie’s release with the Supreme Court’s nullification of Loving.Moast of our ancestors were likely far too naive to have noticed the cohenincidence, back in 1967.Only gentlemen with extremely finely honed instincts – such as Robert Henry Winborne Welch Jr [who was 67 at the time], George Lincoln Rockwell [who was 49 at the time], Patrick Buchanan [who was 28 at the time], or Harold Covington [who was only 14 at the time] – likely noticed the cohenincidence.I’d bet easily 97% to 99% of the population failed to notice it in 1967.I’d also bet that the j00z went plaintiff-shopping for a long long time, until they found a kneegress, named “Loving”, to play the role of the damsel in distress.They sure as heck wouldn’t have elevated her to such cultural prominence if her name had instead been, “Hating”.As in, “Hating Whitey”.Also notice that Fortas et al used a {kneegress x White male} pairing as the case which the court would rule on.Surely a {kneegr0w x White female} pairing would have been vastly more incendiary at the time [cf the movie, as above].

                Interesting you bring up abe fortas. I’ve long suspected there was something up with him. LBJ manages to sneak him on the court by getting Arthur Goldberg to step down by offering a un ambassadorship (which is a downgrade).Earl warren tries leaving the court in 1968 and Johnson wants to promote him to chief justice. The nomination stalls out but instead of staying on as an associate justice, fortas resigns his seat.The question is why would he resign. Is it possible that there were some real skeletons about to be unveiled? Like maybe he was in the mafia? He sure looked like a mafia memberhttps://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/justice-abe-fortas-u-s-supreme-court-credit-denver-post-news-photo/837969522

                    There’s a lot to that story.  Goldberg was definitely dirty  (he was Kennedy’s Secretary of Labor, for crying out loud) and Kennedy put him on the Court to follow Brandeis and  Frankfurter in the designated Jewish seat.  But Johnson wanted his good buddy Abe Fortas  there to help manage any Court problems with the Great Society programs (FDR’s New Deal Court problems were still in living memory). So Johnson levered Goldberg out into the UN ambassador job with all sorts of promises (reappointment to the Court, VP slot in ’68 etc.) all of which were of course bogus.Fortas on the other hand was a total crook.  Back in ’65 Johnson was riding high and got whatever he wanted.  But in ’68 when Johnson tried to move Fortas up to the Chief spot (after Earl Warren) Congress said Nuts to that.  In fact impeachment proceedings were under way when Fortas resigned.Then Nixon gave us Burger, Blackman, Powell  –  and Roe v. Wade.  At least “Renchberg” dissented.

            Alzaebo: “Because it creates more of THEM…!!”No one has ever axed me whether I am a “White supremacist”, but if they were to axe me, then I would say, “No, I am a White inferioracist!!!”Then I would explain that when a White breeds with a j00, the resultant offspring is a j00.That when a White breeds with a kneegr0w, the the resultant offspring is a kneegr0w.That when a White breeds with a street-defecator, the resultant offspring is a street-defecator.That when a White breeds with a g00k, the resultant offspring is a g00k.That when a White breeds with a potato kneegr0w, the resultant offspring is a potato kneegr0w [just kidding with all my leprechaun Bros].Etc etc etc; anyway, whenever a White breeds with a non-White, the result is necessarily non-White.Genes for Whiteness are by far the weakest genes in the species; genes for Whiteness are always recessive opposite any other genes.Ergo, White inferioracist.==========It’s fascinating that the English language ackshually does not have a word inferioracy as an opposite of supremacy; apparently “supremacy” has been in the language since circa 1540 to 1550 AD. I guess we’re supposed to make do with “inferiority”, which dates to Middle English [1066-1499]. But then we have to ask the j00z*** why there’s such a thing as an Inferiority Complex but not a Supremacy Complex.***Specifically Alfred “Early Life” Adler.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler

But how can that be true?

        May I suggest that you do a review of the movie “A Night to Remember” (1958) about the sinking of the Titanic. In particular, the part about the dance band that continued playing while it sank. That is the most apt metaphor of our demise as a nation and culture. Congress is about to send another boat load of fiat to Ukraine and Israel, even as the annual deficit passes $1.7 trillion. Why is it that thousands of Muslims will take to the streets here protesting the Israeli bombing of Gaza, but not a single normie will get off the couch to protest impending bankruptcy? We have earned our downfall.

            What are “normies” to do?  Riot?  Quit asking for the impossible.  The time will come, but it has to be in line with our own racial proclivities—which is not “chimping out” at the slightest reason.  Yes, this may be a loser in the  Darwinian sense, but it is what it is.

                On one hand it is disheartening to see the lack of concern from normie, but OTHO, as you note, it wouldn’t matter if that wasn’t the case.  The regime has shown that they will jail anyone they view as too much of a pest so the doom of this place is completely beyond the control of any normie anyway.

                I agree with this sentiment, but there are many ways to protest and it is the lack of initiative that I find disheartening. It signals defeatism, which can be infectious and become another step on the road to sheepledom. Firearms sales have been rising steadily for years now, and this is a form of protest. But what if normie started buying cheap drones by the dozen (which is still legal). Methinks that would send a more dire message to the Deep State.

                    Speaking of guns, at my age I need no more, but have places where they’ll go upon death—and these weapons are of current quality and technology such as night and thermo vision.  My widow is not going to drag these things to the local gun store, or worse, the Sheriff for disposal. When I die, with luck, they’ll be more of me equipped for futures—whatever they may be.  Something I believe is helpful as these things cost money, more than a young person starting out can afford, but no less necessary to have at that age than at mine.

                    Buying several drones, that is a really interesting idea. One issue that comes to mind is that drones might become obsolete much faster than guns. With the accessories may become obsolete but not the gun itself. Drones, otoh, batteries don’t last forever, jamming technology improves (much faster than ballistic material). But I really like the idea.

Man-portable drones are routinely taking out Main Battle Tanks in Ukraine. The West is providing Ukraine with the best electronic countermeasures it has available – and yet the life expectancy of armor on the battlefield is now measured in minutes. And nexgen drones will be autonomous hunter-killers that do not require either ongoing communications nor a human operator.

        Hrmmmmmmmmm….I grew up in a shitlib hive family infested with garbage liberal women – and though I never saw it… this one strikes me as a classic shitlib chick-flick. A wise, strong willed young liberal woman does Her Own Thing, ignores the stuffy, stupid parents, and sails off into the sunset to Have It All, leaving the naysayers chastised and humiliated by her success. My mom ate this shite right up, I think she secretly imagines herself as the heroine in such tripe. Looking back on it I was fortunate not to live with parents caught up in the divorce craze – had my mom been single and tried to raise us on her own… my brother would be dead and I’d probly be in jail! HAR HAR HAR!!!One of the speechers at our little church out in the country once said that when the devil attacks the family – he goes through the women first. Looks like Ol’ Scratch has been working on and through them for a long, long time.

            That’s the problem with most women, they’ll be happy to embrace the picaninnies that result from such a  miscegenous union.  When I see a mixed race child, all I can think of is a lost child, neither here nor there. No wonder these children grow up so often to be anti-White.  The hatred needs to be directed from their parents to somewhere.

                Those children do often grow up to be anti-white. It’s not solely based on today’s anti-white culture though. I know it was noted that in Sparta, when a Spartan male would have a child with a helot woman, the child would almost always embrace the culture of the helot mother. It could be some evolutionary behavior that the child always identifies with the parent’s race they see as victims.

            The breeder-brained are more susceptible to the lower register vibes, the bestial gods of f*cking, feeding, fighting.To Hell’s call, if you would.That is Its function, as a base of the organic formative layer, the ground effect ancillary to the broiling viral formative layer àt the edge of the atmosphere.Aryan-Erectus combinations, such as -Negroid and -Aborigine (Semites and dot-Indians) produce a wickedly effective type: cannibal instincts with white smarts.Smart enough to be dangerous, blindly determined, ruthlessly loyal to their tribe against outsiders. Utter collectivists, or Hives.  The Left is ancient wiring awakened, responding to the vibe- the god- they generate.Imagine an ant colony.They wouldn’t hear their Queen’s broadcast as stern commands; the Hive would hear it as Her love, pulsating through the colony, bathing them in its caress.  They would die for Her.

                Not really. Dad was fiercely apolitical. Outside of his job and his farm things didn’t interest him much. Mom and I fought like cats and dogs! I was banished from the hive years ago when my daughter discovered she was gay, and I had the wrong opinions about it. It worked for me; I was happier without them too.Then the hive just started to fall apart. They started fighting with each other, divorces and other estrangements happened… it’s sad. Most of that was driven by the pig headed bloody minded women too.There are times I get down on my knees and thank God for my trad-wife.

            Filthie: “A wise, strong willed young liberal woman does Her Own Thing, ignores the stuffy, stupid parents, and sails off into the sunset to Have It All, leaving the naysayers chastised and humiliated by her success.”The chick who starred as Katherine Hepburn’s daughter in the movie was IRL ackshually Katherine Hepburn’s NIECE, Katharine Houghton.Note that Houghton was a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College.And Hepburn was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College.Clearly Stanley Kramer &amp; the Frankfurt School wanted an obvious GENETIC link between the mother figure and the daughter figure; they wanted actual tangible corporeal blood lineage to be abundantly obvious in the film.And their choice of actress talent hunting grounds – Bryn Mawr &amp; Sarah Lawrence – correlates perfectly with your psychological analysis of the situation.These hand-rubbing happy merchants were some seriously cynical &amp; brutally nihilistic shape-shifters.

        The latest in this genre is A Man Named Otto starring (predictably) Tom Hanks as an aging, childless, taciturn Scandinavian widower steel industry engineer who lives in a modest, aging townhome complex in Pittsburgh. He struggles with lack of purpose as he is forcibly retired from his job and struggles further with the competency crisis as his townhome complex is progressively blessed with the benefits of diversity. Hanks finds new purpose in helping his new, helpless neighbors perform mundane tasks such as, for example, parking.Predictably, once again, the diverse crowd teaches Otto the value of life, love, and friendship. Hanks remakes his will to leave all his assets to his new, diverse neighbors then promptly croaks from a heart attack, just as all useless white men should do.Moral of the story: you will be replaced, you will enjoy it, and you will leave your wealth to your replacements.

            Thanks for the warning even though Tom Hanks has been on my avoid at all costs list since before Saving Private Ryan. He’s always come across to me as a sanctimoious prick. He ruined Saving Private Ryan for me, except for him it was a fairly good movie, because he was about 20 years too old for his role.

                Too old…well perhaps by what we are used to generally.  However, Hanks was born in ‘56, movie came out in ‘98.  Hanks was therefore aged about 42 yo.  WWII draft act (1940) had eligible men up to and including 44 yo.  So it is indeed possible that a man of Hanks age could be found as a Sargent on D-day.

                        Yep, we often forget just how young our soldiers now are.  As mentioned, in WWII we had a high average age in the field—mid to upper twenties. I don’t think we’ve fielded an army since then that old.
And I suspect the military likes it that way.  As we age we become a little more retrospective wrt our actions. The service I think prefers the less thoughtful to carry out the (naturally) brutal—but necessary—aspects of killing your fellow man.  🙁

It also correlates perfectly with a military brass comprising solely Passive Aggressive personality types, with nary an Active Aggressor in their ranks.
Passive Aggressives will always maneuver to have “Yes Men” under their command, rather than the kinds of “Phμck U” men who pose an existential threat to the Passive Aggressive Industrial Complex.

                    If he was 42 then he would have been some sort of supply officer or something like that. He would have aged out of front line infantry by then. Mid-thirties was about the limit for field grade officers in combat units at the time I think.

                        I can’t speak to that as I’m not military nor had relatives in American units in WWII, however I know of a 50 something yo Sargent in the AF Paramedics from local base here shipping out to combat duties in ME.  The guy is a monster of a man and wanted action, so switched to a combat role from the paramedics.  Seems Uncle Sam currently needs these folk regardless of advanced age.

                I found it hilarious when Hanks “discovered” WWII after Saving Private Ryan and was Mr WWII for a while.  That was shortly after he was Mr Apollo program.  I read somewhere that Stephen Ambrose, author of Band of Brothers, had to bluntly tell Spielberg that Hanks was too old to play the part of Winters, otherwise old Tom was going to be Winters.  Dunno, but funny if true.

                Sigh…Tom Hanks is probably the most talented and successful actor Hollywood has produced.  That one doesn’t like Hanks is fine, for whatever reason, but denigrating his talent is unreasonable.

                        Then name /describe your criteria for a “talented” actor?
Hanks movies are popular, numerous, and make money to boot. His roles are varied (as in not type cast, say as John Wayne was).  He has been award the highest honors for his work.  Is there any other criteria, other than “I don’t like the guy or his politics” you can provide?
And by the way, “I don’t like the guy or his politics” is perfectly valid for avoiding him—why give him any of your hard earned money—but not for denying his talent in his chosen profession.

                    He’s ok as an actor.  Certainly worse out there.  Hard to pin it down, but his characters always seem “fake deep” in the sense that he tries to be a deep character, but it comes across as somewhat fake, not genuine.  His best role was Forest Gump.
As for more entertaining, Billy Crystal is pretty good, although he does often play the same/similar character – snarky New Yorker.  But he does it well.

        The movie was written by the same committee that wrote To Kill a Mockingbird, the most overrated book in history.It’s been years since I’ve seen the movie, but what struck me most when I saw it was the rudeness of (insert rich white girl) to spring this on her parents and then expect all of the supporting characters to do her heavy lifting throughout the movie.  This is the only realistic part of the movie, as there are a lot of women like that to this day.  I forgot that the timeline of the story is rushed because (insert- got to get out there and save the word) but it makes perfect sense.  All of liberalism is an artificially rushed time-schedule to hurry people through a pre-written script before they have a change to dwell on the situation and add their common sense.  Look at the Covid era.  Perfect example.  “Got to rush out there and get that shot which was itself a rush job without any testing paperwork.”Notice a pattern?   The left never wants you to stop and think.  “Got to get over to Ukraine and save the world”…”got to rip down those statues today,” as if they were put up yesterday.. Rushing people is a way of controlling them.  It’s what gives the sales profession a bad wrap.  No one wants to be in the situation the next day wondering just what the hell they signed that evening.America’s Achilles heel has always been, “change is always good and therefore should be embraced.”  This was hijacked by the left a hundred years ago, and to this day, through the Clinton years, through the Obama years (clean and articulate n-word) and even today.  America’s history will be an unreflective, rushed push off the cliff into oblivion with everyone wondering, in their ruin, what they signed on to.Also, Spencer and Hepburn were pinkos who were more than comfortable with this movie.  Everyone involved was a pinko bent on deconstructing the place.

            A lot of us were “pinkos” (loose use of that term to encompass more that commies) at that time.  That I could see the movie when it came out and not throw up, puts me in that category.  Today, I read Z-man’s  summary and only think, “…did he really watch that movie and sit through it—again?”

            To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the most boring movies ever produced. Having said that, it should be mandatory for dissidents to view it.You have all the liberal psychodrama out there:The good white, noble, ethical ….The bad white, ignorant, violent, with bad teeth…The diverse people, like little children abused by the bad white and having the need of the good white to protect them. They even applaud the good white.The good white as a hero, as a knight that imparts justice.This narcissistic psychodrama is playing in the heads of every liberal. Nowhere was as easy to grasp as in To Kill a Mockingbird

        Satan and his legion of postmodern demons wriggled to the earth’s surface in the 1960s. Of that there is no doubt. Short of actual conquests such as resulted from the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, never has civilization been damaged so grievously in such a short time as the West circa 1964-1969. Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? is one of that period’s semphores conducting the West into the abyss.

            Early boomer-1946- and like many now rue our small parts in the 60’s debasing the culture.  Keep in mind that we were still wet behind the ears know it alls, not those responsible for manning the ramparts. Unfortunately, plenty of guilt to be spread about.

            I love being at the age where I just don’t give a shit what people think of me. Truth be known, I’ve always been that way, it’s just when you are younger with a wife and kids to support, the necessity to simp is strong. I’ve stopped lowering my voice and whispering so as not to offend any of the “alphabet nazi’s” and am actively supporting my race.  F’ em. F’em all.

            The Cosby Show was also instructive.  Season one, wholesome “gynecologist” with basement office, perfectly white acting family.  By the last season they were jumping around like monkeys.  Then 30 years later you find out that dad “the gynecologist” was in real life the most prolific rapist in modern history.  We haven’t even seen the other shoe drop on the clean, articulate Obama.

                His being a gynecologist, of all the specialties he could have been, can be seen in a new light after all the rape allegations. Which I take with a grain of salt btw. Since beloved house negroes like him had to be discredited, somehow, before The Precious could sic BLM on us.

                    Considering how many photos there are of simpering white floosies hanging off Cosby, sometimes 3 and 4 at a time, I doubt he ever had to ask twice for sex, let alone rape anyone.
I don’t think he’s a good guy (I remember how he stabbed Robert Culp in the back after Culp stood up for him for that first big role) but I think you’re right that there’s a secondary agenda here, tear down the black hero being uppermost.

        I’d say nothing dates the film more effectively than this: “He has a plan to save Africa by teaching the smart African kids how to do stuff so they can make Africa great again. No kidding.”
My father worked for the UN just after the film was made. This view — that Africa would be made into First-World nations by the generation born after the end of colonialism was irrefutable dogma among all aid agencies.
Understand: they all believed this.
In fairness, it was a less insane idea than Wakanda.

                I don’t know when he took up the white man’s burden, but if he’d read VS Naipaul’s A Bend in the River, he might have been tipped off to what he was going to encounter. Naipaul was considered to be something of a  race traitor for having written such an unflattering work in the late Seventies. After all, he was of Indian heritage. But Naipaul grew up in Trinidad and was not fond of the black, West Indian establishment, and he was overjoyed to find a home in England.

                    A Bend in the River is highly recommended reading (by me.) Another is Naipaul’s A House for Mr Biswas. Set in Trinidad (I think), it describes the efforts of an Indian man intent on building his dream house. It takes him decades. Illuminating as to the true nature of that demographic iis the constant backbiting and petty intrigues of his extended clan all seemingly intended to defeat his efforts.

            There is a great book by a now dead telegram reported called Banana Sunday. it is his memoir of having covered Africa from right after the war through the end of colonialism. He has a lot of great observations about the Westerners who arrived in the 60’s and 70’s full of new ideas and new ways of selling them. He always returns to an axiom of Africa he learned when he started out there: Africa Wins Again. It means that all Western ideas eventually succumb to the reality of Africa.

                There’s also Waugh’s “Black Mischief” from 1932. The aid workers give the Africans condoms, who use them to decorate trees, if I recall correctly. Modern people think the novel is “racist.” But Waugh, as a reactionary Catholic, really was satirizing modern whites for exterminating themselves with contraception. In 1930, the Lambeth Conference of the Church of England was the first major Protestant denomination to allow contraceptives, at first only for married couples. In the 91 years since Waugh’s novel, who has won the demographic war? Africa wins again.

            For anyone who hasn’t seen it, look up the documentary “Empire of Dust” (Chinese efforts to get something, anything, to work properly in Africa). The trailer suffices, and is still on Youtube. The Chinese administrator’s scathing rant to his foreman says it all.

They really did. And they had the pure faith to back up their intentions. These people were goofy and laughable by that day’s standards, but they could move mountains and got shit done – ephemeral as their progress was and easily exploited and undone by the next local tinpot warlord.

        An interesting turn in the plot was that the Draytons were not Catholic.  The priest was just a family friend and not their spiritual advisor.  I guess that justified their decision since it was motivated by (to them) secular advice.

        As preachy and cringe as that Poitier movie was, the underlying sentiment of “racist White men must be schooled by noble negroes” got amped up to 11 in the mid-70s with TV sitcoms the likes of Good Times, What’s Happening!!, Diff’rent Strokes and a few others I am pleased to report that I can’t recall the names of.The overwhelming success of those humiliate-YT half hour homilies inevitably ushered in the pushy joosh angle (Bridgette Loves Bernie), blatant latino pandering (Chico and the Man) and even prototype stronk single woman-don’t-need-no-man fish bicycling (One Day At a Time). Naturally, there were also combos attempted as well, choosing one oppressed group from column A and another from column B like a Chinese takeout menu. With number three you get egg roll.Common theme: Foolish, clueless, knee-jerk sexist, bigoted White guy, a veritable walking stereotype, who invariably takes a rake to the ‘nads before the closing credits. But he is also plagued with short memory, so that by next week’s episode all his schooling is forgotten such that he must have his ‘nads raked yet again. All so very predictable, tedious and tiresome.

            Archie Bunker gave as good as he got.
Race was merely a comedic device in the vast majority of episodes of The Jeffersons, Good Times and Sanford and Son. The others, I don’t know much about, although I do recall Diff’rent Strokes being so dull and boring I couldn’t stand to watch it.

            Diff’rent Strokes and Webster are routinely cited by leftists as “problematic” to “racist”. I guess the 1980s were a weird transitional period where white saviorism was not yet seen as backdoor supremacy.
Of course, the whole neoliberal project is a form of backdoor white supremacy. But no one knows that…yet.

        It should have had a more realistic ending, either with her as a single mother with his kids unable to find a man willing to accept her and her offspring. Or even better with the husband facing a triple homicide rap where her and her parents are the victims. It is not at all difficult to find these cases IRL.It is no accident that the story is BM/WF instead of WM/BF.  The people, and I’m willing to bet that they are spelled (((people))) who made this did it because they hate us.  They thought the BM/WF formulation would maximize humiliation on the audience.  That’s what makes this so evil. It’s not like they thought this was nothing out of the ordinary. They did it precisely because it was so uncommon and opposed by both peoples.

            I think the BM/WF coupling was chosen because it was starting to happen at the time and the reverse, WM/BF was almost never happening. It was a significant form of rebellion among liberal college girls, although most of them didn’t take it to the point of marrying one.

                        Hispanic is the result of miscegenation.  The term Hispanic (in the US) usually refers to a mix of Indian (feather) and Spanish or Portuguese. IOW, a Mestizo.
There’s a movement in the Southwest somewhere where they claim to be the master race as bringing together the best of Indian and European. I forget the name of the movement though.
Supposedly there is what they call “colorism” in Central and South America where the higher your White ancestry the better and the higher your African ancestry the worse.  Pretty funny when you think about i.

Very similar to the Indian (with a dot) Caste system.  Darker you are, the lower the Caste.

                        Hispanic is the result of miscegenation. The term Hispanic (in the US) usually refers to a mix of Indian (feather) and Spanish or Portuguese. IOW, a Mestizo.
True, but the definition used by GAE is much broader.  Incidentally, several anthropologists (pro and amateur) regard Native Americans as being of Asian descent.  So it could be argued mestizos are quasi-Hapas.

                    WMAF (white male asian female) is very dominant. I don’t know of any AMWF pairings personally, nor can I recall any in popular media.
You could see some BMAF (black male asian female) creeping into popular media recently, but it seems to have been halted. My guess is because you can’t humiliate Asians. They’ll just quietly boycott, and when their time comes, they will swarm and remove the problem.

        The question is and always has been why are modern whites so susceptible to the usual suspects’ (and their Puritan lackeys) propaganda?Sure, we got rich and lazy. There’s that. But other races have been wealthier and don’t seem willing to buy into the lies. Granted, the Japanese, Chinese and Koreans never allowed the usual suspects into their society so they can pick and choose what Western ideas to use and discard. But even Americans Hispanics, who aren’t the brightest bulbs and who live in America, don’t buy the Negro worship garbage, though that they are fine marrying whites.Also, whites used to be very race aware, just like other races. What happened to us? Why are we so ready to believe ridiculous lies?Yes, there’s the Hajnal Line where the clannishness of whites was bred out, but, again, those whites may not have been as clannish, but they certainly were race aware.Future historians will marvel at our stupidity. As to the usual suspects, well, they do what they do. They’re not exactly subtle, as we’re seeing now with the war in Gaza and the hysterical, massive outburst in the media about antisemitism everywhere all the time. (The usual suspects are like a con man. Once you realize that it’s a con, the con man’s actions are laughably obvious and a bit embarrassing to watch.) But we’re the ones who fell for this ridiculous con.One of history’s great mysteries will be what happened the Western Europeans. I’m living through it, and I can’t figure it out. Future historians will been even more baffled.

            “Also, whites used to be very race aware, just like other races. What happened to us? Why are we so ready to believe ridiculous lies?”
indoctrination in a country works only on native population, meaning american whites are the only ones who buy into the government bullshit.
chinese or mexicans are not susceptible to american hutu worship cause they’re not american, but they’re highly susceptible to indoctrination back home.
mexican/chinese states don’t promote miscegenation, that’s why people from those countries don’t worship hutus.
if chinese/mexican person fully integrates into white liberal society, then he also becomes susceptible to hutu worship.

                I haven’t seen that. The Hispanics in the Northern Virginia openly hate blacks. The Asians and Indians avoid them like the plague and openly talk about blacks as animals.
I’ve never – never – seen an Asian or Indian with a black as a date. Come to think about about it, I’ve never seen a Hispanic with one either.

            It is baffling why Whites fall for the propaganda, but the staggering number of hours spent in front of the TV explains a big part of it I’d say.
I’m guessing most of us here fell for it at one time, at least to some extent.  I know I did, a long time ago.  The good news is, once you snap out of it, there’s no going back to being a race delusionist.

                Skin whiteners sell big in the Caribbean countries.  There are even YT video interviews discussing the phenomena.  One aspect are native women asking their prospective boyfriends whether they use such products.  Truth in advertising as it were.

            Europeans are perfectly well adapted to dealing with the actual threats that historically faced them. We can see this even today in the Ukraine conflict with the pan-European response to a Russian incursion. Then they developed the technology to travel to places and people with which they had no prior connection (aside from Marco Polo and a few others, trade in the ancient world traveled in hops with no real intercourse occurring end-to-end).Initially, the European explorers’ reaction to the locals was about what you’d expect, with conquest and proselytizing being high on the agenda. Now, the former colonials (having rendered colonization uneconomical with their growing nationalism) utilize European technologies to flood the West à la The Camp of the Saints. Europeans are helpless in the face of this invasion because it lacks historical precedence, even among the downtrodden Scottish, Irish, Catalans, or Québécois.Of course, the role of parasitism cannot be overlooked. We are told by our alien occupiers that diversity is a good thing, that in any event there is nothing we can do about it, and that actually we deserve it because we were colonizers ourselves (a logical fallacy if ever there was one). Our overlords exploit our ignorance (which at this stage is willful) of the peoples of this world to colonize and exploit us in the exact same manner as the Spanish conquistadores, not least by using their new religion as a weapon against us.

            Modern Whites on both sides overestimate how racist Whites were in the past, but the truth is Whites of Northern European decent have long been at least somewhat accepting of outsiders.
Heritage Americans used to treat non-Whites as second class citizens, while at the the same time they strongly believed they had a moral responsibility to care for them. This sort of good shepherd mentality is probably the main difference between (some) Whites and everyone else.

        Another wise negro-bad white man film of the era was The Bedford Incident. Richard Widmark was the overzealous, even maniacal, navy destroyer skipper and Poitier a visiting press reporter. Poitier waxes poetic and Widmark ends up killing them all with his whiteness. Ostensibly a Cold War action film, it employed the same devices as Guess Who Is Coming to Dinner.

            I didn’t think The Bedford Incident played up the racial angle nearly as much as Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.  Poitier’s photojournalist character could have easily been played by a white actor.  Widmark’s character is a resentful martinet who has been passed over for promotion.  He’s got a chip on his shoulder the size of the rock of Gibraltar.  Widmark’s character dislikes Poitier’s character not so much for being black, but for being yet another smug, effete liberal who sneers at the military while sleeping soundly under the protection it provides.  They filmmakers even take a swipe at Barry Goldwater by showing the destroyer captain wearing the same distinctive thick black glasses that Goldwater wore during the 1960s.

        Don’t forget that in 1967, the educated classes where very internationalist in their outlook and were quite taken with the idea of transnational institutions solving global problems. It was the pinnacle of the optimism of the human reason. For the upper crust in those days, the idea of a black doctor running the WHO, or an international man of mystery like Obama becoming the US president, was not really subversive or contrary to the felt pieties of the era. It was something they looked upon with a sense of accomplishment, just like the contemporaneous space program and the general advancement of industry and technology.At the bottom of all this is something that Oswald Spengler called Alexandrianism—i.e. the urbane outlook, the desire to spread urban living and rationalist beliefs far and wide—which commences at the climax of every civilization. Whether this is practical or not does not even occur to anybody, for any thought to the contrary would blunt the courage of the idea. It is not that they are “universalist” (for that would imply that a greater degree of reflection is employed than is really the case); it’s that they consider urbanity to be the only thing to do and the pursue it withoutarrière-pensée.

            “Don’t forget that in 1967, the educated classes where very internationalist in their outlook and were quite taken with the idea of transnational institutions solving global problems.”
Agreed. These were the heady days of the post-colonial era when a new indigenous ruling class was coming to power in Africa and Asia. These were people who wore suits and could speak fluent English (or French). Two of the films Poitier was in have this transnational leitmotif — “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” and even more so “A Warm December.”

            I think that’s why the first scene takes place in an airport, where (as Zman notes) everyone is cool with the inter-racial couple. In 1967, airports were The Future: stark and clean, upper class, trans-national, enlightened. Sparsely populated too.
The message is: This is where all the beautiful people already are, so the rest of you need to get with the program.

        Anything that gets the accolades &amp; the relentless media promotion/spin I avoid like the plague &amp; I’m in the biz but then I’m a heretic.

Fortunately saw it for free, not even worth $1.00.

        “Of course, the civil rights movement was at its peak, so this was just what white liberals wanted to see, which was white liberals being celebrated for their goodness.” That’s the rub, ain’t it? There may be no limit to how impressed white liberals are with themselves.That is why I’m skeptical of this notion of “guilt-ridden liberals” that I’ve seen a couple of the commenters here invoke. These liberals have never appeared the least bit guilty to me. Rather, they have consistently exhibited self-satisfaction in the extreme. Their seemingly masochistic racial views serve as status markers for them: those views enable them to demonstrate how superior they are to all those other (lesser) whites. It’s all about how marvelous white liberals are. Am I missing something here? Where’s the guilt?I have never seen GUESS WHO’S COMING TO DINNER. I do my best to avoid insulting lectures masquerading as cinema. The last thing that interests me is being scolded about morality by the degenerates in Hollywood.

            Guilty as charged. I think you are correct. Even urban whites were still rural and provincial. In the big urban centers they encountered a smug, arrogant group long accustomed to living above the riff-raff as cosmopolitans. Those provincials felt ashamed and lacked confidence so they bent over backwards to adopt every fashion and trend proposed by the well-heeled perma-cosmopolitans.I see it still today. The midwesterner who comes to the big city and feeling the weight of no status cave in around him, moves to hipster area, gets covered in tattoos, plasters his cafe with, “Trans Kids Have Rights”, posters and immediately begins to snear with scorn at the place he came from as a key part of entry into the cosmopolitan city class.As great as their fear of being called the R word is, being seen as a backward rube is far worse. Of course, professing self hatred and being treasonous to you own kind is the most backward thing one could do. Satan is very seductive. This is why America is the root of all evil. The Founders were aristocrats and before they even left the earth, it was already destroyed. How the European aristocracy succumbed to this I do not know. I guess when the merchants and industrialists have all the money and money becomes status, the aristocrats, sidelined and powerless, just cave. Cuck Charles is pathetic with his groveling and apologizing to a rabble on a continent.In any case, rambling over, you are I think correct. A total lack of confidence in one’s culture and folk gives way to a massive fear of appearing an unsophisticated anti-cosmopolitan rube. That fear underlies the fear of the R word – though the consequences of guilt through media accusation are a very real and effective weapon.Letting slander and libel, an inversion of our entire legal framework, become normalized has and continues to be the wrecking ball turned carpet bombs that are dismantling our civilization. May our people survive and emerge victorious from the ruins. It would be incapable of damage if the plebians trying to masquerade as cosmopolitan elites were confident in who they are and aimed their scorn at spite at those who would seek to denigrate them by getting them to hate and renounce themselves and their own kind.

                        Good point. The Southern elite maintained their aristocratic nature as the northern elite descended into a merchant driven order, which is to say, a disorder.

            “That is why I’m skeptical of this notion of “guilt-ridden liberals” that I’ve seen a couple of the commenters here invoke. These liberals have never appeared the least bit guilty to me. Rather, they have consistently exhibited self-satisfaction in the extreme.”
Agreed.  Many dissident writers, Jared and Derb come to mind, sometimes refer to white people hating themselves.
They don’t hate themselves.  As you noted, they feel great about themselves.  They just hate us and our history.

        Fast forward ten years: Sidney Poitier has a protective order against him by the mud sh*rk and her two mystery spawn. Katherine Hepburn has become an alcoholic and pill addict. Spencer Tracey is now a proto-SJW race-attorney and is constantly guilt-shaming his woebegone daughter. The priest has been exposed and defrocked as… well, you know.  The elder Poiters are dead in a double murder-suicide that looks staged. Their son Sidney is the prime suspect but he’s been too slick to be caught, hiding behind his elite perquisites.I never watched this absurd melodrama. I never will. I might have watched it early on but the cringey recruitment is too familiar by now.

            Well Sidney Poitier was married to a white woman (Joanna shimkus) and there was never any of that stuff as far as I know.
Plus, only one of his two daughters he had with her had children of there own, and it was with a white guy.

        Yesterday I was on the treadmill at the gym and there was a bank of televisions in front of me.  I always do my best to avoid eye contact with them but it’s impossible not to at least glance up from time to time.The one directly in front of me was broadcasting Fox News.  I happened to look up while they were in a commercial break (keep in mind I can’t hear anything, the TVs are all muted with captions).  An “ad” begins with a man walking out of his home in an upper middle class subdivision.  He gets to the front of his two car garage and someone has painted a rather crude swastika on it as well as the message “Kill the Jews”.  He looks suitably horrified and saddened by this.As he’s looking at his defaced home an AWFL with her sprog in the backseat slowly drives by and witnesses these events.  She too looks appropriately horrified and concerned.  Jump cut to her pulling into her driveway, perhaps just down the street, where her normie white husband is under the hood of his car.  He sees her pull in, looks up, and smiles.  She begins to smile back but then she looks down and sees…white paint all over his shoes.So not only is the white man literally Hitler, he can only write like a first grader, he’s so clumsy that he gets paint all over himself, and he’s so stupid that he doesn’t notice he’s wearing evidence of his crime.Dark, dark thoughts went through my mind.  And what on earth was the “conservative” news network doing by broadcasting this hate speech?  Apart from crusty Boomers, white grillers are just about the only ones that watch Fox.  Did nobody see this ad and say, “this isn’t very complimentary to our core audience”?

            If you watched the World Series last night, you’ll have seen a commercial announcing, with stark white text on a solemn black card, that antisemitism has risen 388% lately (such a specific number must be true, right?).Then another title card announces that anti Muslim, black, Asian and LGBT hate has risen too.That got a series of audible “F You”-s out of me. Even if you grant that the rise in antisemitic statements is real—that they even represent antisemitism strictly defined—who exactly is responsible for it? Who are the protestors against Israel?  Answer: Muslims, blacks, pink-haired lesbians, the whole usual catalog of malcontents.But to the makers of that ad—I think it was the ADL—the enemy is always the Christian European man.Never mind that the supposedly conservative political party is screaming its support for Israel; never mind that evangelicals are calling on Israel to commit a genocide against its “enemies.” Those people are deluded fools, of course; but they’re real—and to the makers of that ad, it’s never enough.The aliens they’ve brought into this country hate them. But they will still side with those haters if it means they can all hate together on the founding stock of this country. That’s their only desire, their only motivation. It would be hard to find a more ungrateful group of people than those ad-makers.I’m sure they didn’t even have to pay for the air time. At least, not retail.

                Not to tell you what to do ChrisZ. Consider, no matter how cool baseball in the playoffs is, not watching it anymore. I think we are better off putting together an education curriculum or starting a pro-European mens group in our local area. That kind of blatant anti-white propaganda does not warrant support.
Just a suggestion my good man. God bless!

                    Ha—you’re a good guy, Reality. I had the game on in the background as I was puttering around, playing with the dog, and reading (an article about Eliot’s “The Waste Land,” as Providence had it).
The sound of baseball being played recalls some beautiful times for me. But the thought you express has frequently come to my mind; and I’ve warned my kids off of getting emotionally attached to sportsball.
Thanks for your good counsel, and good wishes. They are returned.

                        Yes. Of all the sportsball playoff MLB is the most compelling and riveting of the sports. At that stage every single pitch has meaning in the context of that shifts slightly with each pitch and count. It is a marvel of a game when the announcers can explain it to you from the manager’s, batter’s and pitcher’s perspective.It is a shame all of our games have been ruined by white erasure and oligarchs using them as a heavy handed propaganda mechanism. The same is true of tennis which is now an unenjoyable sack of ruins.Right on ChrisZ. I am trying to get my nieces and nephews off of sportsball watching and gulp Disney. It is really the parents I am working on. Playing sportsball balanced with outdoorsman activities and a martial art are fine. Passive watching of propaganda and imbibing the anti-culture of African sportsballers is toxic. Remember Lombardi? “When you get to the end zone, act like you’ve been there before.” Then his team would work the spring and summer at the meat packing plants. The good old days.

                    I have a group of engineers that I work with that I call “the lunch bunch.” The first time we went out to eat, I told everyone to turn off their phones and that everything we said would be off the record. We would have full free speech, even things considered verboten by those in charge. We supported each other and told the truth about the “crime of noticing” and other issues.We helped each other with our problems. We laughed. Sometimes we commiserated. Sometimes we celebrated. It was a great fellowship, united by the fact we were men being men and that most of us agreed on the big things, such as race, politics, gender and other issues.We don’t meet as often as we like. It’s almost like Fight Club. But it helped keep me sane that I wasn’t alone and I think it had the same effect for the other guys. Anyone who wanted to bring a friend to our gatherings, they had to be carefully vetted by others in our group before we allowed them to visit.Support your friends. Create lasting relationships. Separate, we are weak, but in unity, there is strength.

                “ …that antisemitism has risen 388% lately…”Been there, done that….  Way back when the Feminists were in their heyday on campus, they came out with the stat that 3 in 4 coeds would be the victim of sexual molestation on campus during their program of studies.  The issue was not so much the statistic, but the *definition* of the term “sexual molestation”.  Normal people consider the worse, like rape.  feminists defined molestation to be just about any activity between the sexes that they disliked.Similarly, I take the above antisemitism stat as bogus until I know exactly their definition of “antisemitism” and were they got the data from.   Most all these statistics are in a reasoning sense fabricated and simply agitprop.

                Thank you, I looked for it yesterday evening and couldn’t find it.  I missed the first few seconds, and couldn’t hear it.  So my apologies to…ah fuck it.  With all the anti-white propaganda out there, I get a Mulligan.
And the message itself still grates.  You know where there isn’t any anti-Semitism?  Israel.  I hear it’s a wonderful place.

        The good news is that Killers of the Flower Moon has bombed at the box office and is virtually certain to be a big money loser. After 3 weeks in theaters, not even halfway to recouping its $200 million budget. But for Apple, a $50 million loss (when all is said and done) is a rounding error. It can afford to do that a few more times in the name of whatever it is it is trying to do.

        Thank you for this.  There is a silly view that anti-white propaganda just started in the last 10 years or so.  But you can find it going back at least to the 1950s.  Take a look at popular shows of the period and there was a lot of preaching us about how evil white bigots were etc
But as the article states, white liberals and moderate whites were so incredibly gullible. We need to point out the anti-wide agenda in TV shows and in schools going back to at least mid-century.

            As a kid I noticed that on one episode of Kids Say the Darndest Things, Art Linkletter gave the microphone to one young kid-contestant who was black, who repeated what he had been coached to say: “the world needs to recognize Sammy Davis Jr. and Ray Charles.” Without comment, Art took the microphone to the next kid. Was he based?

                This is a complex history, but I get what you mean. By accidents of life I came late to the liberal party and was around college students 15 years ago before the awokening happened. I remember then was peak Family Guy irreverence against everything and GWB bashing. But I also remember a young woman that called her friends tranny as a way to bond with them. At the time liberals fanaticism was contained to GOP bashing.But sometime around 2012 there was a viral contagion of anti white ideology. I used to live near a college campus B&amp;N and then a lot of “historical” books appeared with the subject of American being racist after the civil rights era and up to today. It was a brain software update rolled out in colleges that most of the nation was not introduced to. I also remember around 2010 Netflix started rolling out plenty of documentaries about social issues in America.This new awakening is not too distant. I remember the most fanatical acquaintances I had started calling themselves woke around that time. I know now that the term has older uses, but until 2012 I had never heard this term. My assumption was that they felt awakened to the real history of America a la Howard Zinn.I think you are correct that this stuff started way before, but most people (at least me) was totally unaware of how intentional the brainwashing was. I honestly thought we were in post racist utopia since the 80s and all the social messaging in media was just a “booster” shot on society.Just after 2017 I felt into the YT rabbit hole and discovered content like Blackpilled. This brought memories from my education in the 80s and I realized how the de-whiteization plan started around the 60s and I was born pretty much at the height of the hurricane. I realized how families started after 69 pretty much have no hope unless you had the luck of having parents with a deep faith.Other readings have opened my eyes on how all the churches (from Evangelicals to Catholics) were infiltrated and even how the communities were subverted intentionally by importing blacks to ethnic neighborhoods. I learned about busing during the 2020 presidential election if you can believe it.So in a way this is a very old plan, but some of us have only discovered it in the last 8 years so understand that for a lot of people here woke is a relatively new concept.

        The long war against whites would have never succeeded if a major flank in the anti-white army was not comprised of guilt-ridden good whites desperate to assuage their imagined guilt by consuming and accepting images of them accepting fealty to the grand genius blacks who now flower due to our emancipating them. A strange idea. A people so impotent they need to be freed and then bowed down to by the people who they will be superior to.In any case, the stupid whites who see themselves as good whites are still arrayed against us. Unfortunately, those stupid whites have tremendous power. We see it if we ever watch TV, get a pop-up ad, visit a retail store, see a billboard, and when our elite and even mid-tier Universities announce admissions and feature photos of their surgical school, law school, engineering school … new admissions.It will be what, 10-20 years before their children, if they have any, face the consequences of their delusions? For however long that takes, the whites least equipped to fight the war will have to wage it not just alone but in the face of their own people fighting against them. Those of us who are equipped are going to have to be of great help to our lesser equipped folk while not squandering resources and capital on lost causes. At the same time, we are going to have to appeal to find a way to fight against the whites with the power without making them permanent enemies. At some point we will need some of them on our side. That said, those who are promoting the invasion of our country must be marked for punishment when we win. Until we win, we table putting any energy on consequences so that it NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.Our children, be they our own or those of our folk, are precious and they are everything. We must get them out of the hands of the regime and help them forge their identity. We must also arrange our army so that some flanks beat on the tribes arrayed against us. Other flanks keep their hands clean without subjugating themselves to proxies by focusing on being of service to our folk.Educating our own children is the battle we must wage immediately or the war is already lost. All of us must be a part of this effort. Hint, waiting for Rufo and a gaggle of non-white mothers to defeat CRT in schools is a waste of time. The curiculums exist, the people with the academic, outdoorsman skills exist, the people with the traditional farming skills exist, the people with the properties to host winter and summer camps for our folk and youth exist. It is up to us to organize it and tie it all together and do it at scale while cleverly maintaining freedom of association.Carpe Diem

            This is exactly how I read the Bible, a chronicle of the shifting winds of loyalty and identity between the white and mixed twelve tribes.
Reading it like that means the possibility that we can bring many Christians back to /our/ side, across the bridge, away from the universalists.
Not that the Word is false, but that its reading was shifted by false priests.

        When that movie was released, I took great pains not to be corralled into watching it. I guessed it was bad, but until I read this post, I had no idea it was THAT bad.

                pyrrhus:  I remember watching a bit of of it with my parents when it was on t.v. in 1971.  Didn’t even know who the surprise dinner guests were and obviously the little I watched made no great impression on me.  I was 14 at the time.

        For the people pushing and peddling the yarn that there are no race differences, Sidney Poitier was a godsend. One of those rare blacks who actually had some intelligence and could talk and comport himself like a white man. He was not a bad actor. He made a number of films back then — “In the Heat of the Night” comes to mind but also “A Warm December.”
The deceit lies in portraying Poitier as representative of his race. He’s most emphatically not. Though guilt-ridden liberals might want to imagine so.

            Poitier and a few others were the model that nice, naive Whites believed all blacks could be, given the elimination of poverty and segregation.  The truth is Poitier was just at the right tail of the bell curve and was an outlier, one of the Talented Tenth.The naive Whites back then expected that eventually most blacks would become “more White,” similar to Poitier.  Instead, in the same way that standards in school and professions have been lowered or eliminated, our Western culture has become degraded, becoming saturated with black “music”, movies, fashion, behavior, etc.Blacks never became Poitierized, and they never will.

            I got suckered into watching “In the Heat of the Night”. It was the worst movie I had seen up to that time, and I had already sat through some Three Stooges films.
It is still high on my list of bad movies.

            I saw a clip of a homeless man who said he saw a woman let herself be known by a dog for some crack.  Now why would a crack dealer do that?  Racial humiliation.  I feel that the only way to regain honor once it is lost is through violence.  But knowing Whites most of them would rather cope via their religion and take succor in that.  But honor itself can only be regained by violence.  Fact is Whites as a race were coasting on the honor of their ancestors.  The White race is losing honor fast.

        Cultural value be damned, I have never, nor will I ever subject myself to one of these white-guilt movies.  Why should I watch a movie that I know for certain I will hate? The whole genre of these “feel-sorry-for-the-negro” (or other oppressed-by-whitey) movie is to change white behavior and have us accept the forced-at-gunpoint desegregation of the federal government.  No thanks.  A short list among the dozens if not hundreds of these anti-white movies I have never nor will ever watch are:  In the Heat of the Night, Patch of Blue, MS Burning, Till, Jungle Fever, 12 Years a Slave, Django Unchained, Inglorious Bastards, Hidden Figures, Schindler’s List, Jacob the Liar, Driving Miss Daisy, the Color Purple, etc, etc.  No thanks.

                One or two is enough to get the gist. You don’t need to torture yourself with all of them. The Tarantino ones (based on maybe 5 min of each I have seen) are especially bad and to be avoided. They are just cartoons.
