        Speaking of crazy delusions, Reddit’s Fednews forum is a real eye-opener. These federal employees are thrashing around in the belief that they are being “illegally” fired, that their jobs are selfless public service, that Trump and Elon are evil, and that the elimination of their jobs will cause the country to fall apart.There’s also genuine shock that the public isn’t sympathetic to their plight. Don’t they get it? For decades, the private sector has been destroyed by policies coming from DC. First our manufacturing jobs were sent overseas, and then the country was flooded with tens of millions of illegals to take the jobs remaining. Meanwhile, these people mocked and scorned regular Americans impacted by these sh*tty policies.They told us to learn to code.They called us stupid.They called us racist. These pampered, privileged idiots have no idea, nor any sympathy, for what regular Americans have been facing every day in the job market, much less in our neighborhoods and schools — schools that were expected to teach in multiple languages and let mentally ill dudes shower with our daughters.And now these federal employees want sympathy from US?Don’t make me laugh.They’re saying, “Just wait ’til they need our service. They’ll be sorry…” No, we won’t.Service? What service? At tax time, I’ve often said that I’d rather send my money to drunken monkeys, because at least then, my hard-earned money wouldn’t be used to torment good people.

            In addition to “learn to code”, I’ll always remember a GWB 2004 campaign speech where he talked about retraining manufacturing workers as healthcare workers, using community colleges for the “retraining”.
So maybe these former federal “workers” can learn to change bedpans, if that market hasn’t been cornered by Haitians yet.

                It has.  We needed home care help for my mother-in-law last year, and discovered every agency is staffed with black foreigners.  They send out a white manager to set everything up, but then send in the third world for the actual care.  They were fine for basic tasks, and certainly better than American blacks, but still.

                        You’re absolutely right. Back in ‘83 my father had to bring in round the clock care for his aunt who was in her late 70’s who had suffered a massive stroke. His aunt had a large collection of antiques and paintings, several of which disappeared over the span of ‘72 hours.

                            Both my parents ended their days in hospice, 35 and 25 years ago respectively. When Dad was on his way out (that was the 35 years ago) Mom was gently recommended that the patient have nothing of great value, not even his wedding band. This was back in 1989, in the central Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, which is about as close to 100% white as you could get.Obviously the risks bringing strangers into one’s own home are multiplied many times over. It’s sad to say, but one must be aware of the risk of theft or other crime from any stranger one allows into one’s home, whether it’s Mrs. Avery the cleaning lady or Shaqueeza the attendant.

                How about the time the woman stood up and said “I have to work three jobs in order to make ends meet and — ” Bush cut her off and got the crowd to drown her in applause, saying “isn’t that the most American thing you’ve ever heard? God bless you!”

                    Yep, and stepping over the bodies of the starving is pretty common in third world crapholes.  But really, such was the case (working to death) in the early part of the industrialization of the US in the “robber baron” era.  Without some important societal changes—especially during the Great Depression—we’d have had a second revolution.  But hell, Bush (the stupid) was never a great thinker, only a political pawn.

                True. But these idiots believe they are underpaid. They claim they could’ve made more in the private sector. Many are now distressed that they’ll have to get a job that’s “only about making money” compared to selfless public service.Never mind they couldn’t get fired (until now), that their retirement plans were well beyond the dreams of private citizens, that their health care was gold-plated, and that there was virtually no accountability.They have no idea what the real world is like…or maybe in some secret part of their brains, they do — which is why they’re crapping their pants right now.

                        No they should spend less. As soon as they start complaining, explain how firings happen in the private sector all the time and then walk away. If they are really bad, tell them learn to code and then walk away.

                            Sounds good, but the effect is to further radicalize them into thinking that if the private sector is this bad, then we must eliminate the private sector entirely.

                            If doing this online, I’d decorate my “learn to code” email or response with a few “educational” links purporting to teach them the basic skills. I’d make sure that every one of them was written by a Pajeet, used Pajeet names in the examples (let’s make a list of our employees as a Python array – [“Syed”, “Samir”, “Ahmed”]), and was full of ads for H1B scam employment agencies based in India. Let the stupid fucks experience the despair every laid off White tech worker does every day. It’s impossible to convey the hatred I feel for these smug assholes.

                                Yes. And show them the career pages for every tech company that doesn’t have any photos of White men in them and a time capsule of the jobs that last month were in America that are now suddenly in Pune, Hyderabad, Lima … …These smug fucks that it was all fun when they were kicking their countrymen to the mud. There is no fate bad enough that they could suffer. The tech oligarchs and the financiers are also deserving of a fate.It is one thing to abuse your position and life to suck for being a pleb. Fine. But when you take everything from them and hand it to an other and strip them of the ability to use their entire expertise built up over a career overnight that is evil. Then you do it in a system where the only valued is your ability to earn, and you can take that away willy nilly, the powderkeg is eager to blow.White collars are just entering the crisis window where we are going to find out what the Rust Belt folk went through. There was a taste of it in 2003-5 with the India offshoring. ZIRP and offshore sucking brought tech jobs into the boom. Now that Ramascammy style IPO and PE swindles are off the table, they are going back to sending the jobs overseas.A system that it this abusive of those who play by the rules and are earnest is extremely unstable. The high is turning on the low. We may not stop eating dirt, but maybe we’ll find some sadistic pleasure in watching these smug fucks dropped off by the truckload and thrown amongst us.

                        The famous ones are, compared to the money they bring in. The minimum-salary guys are too, compared to the average player, who isn’t any better but gets paid much more. The bloat is in the upper middle, all the unexceptional names you recognize.Steve Jobs was grossly underpaid. On-the-ground servicemen got almost nothing and the machines were made by slaves. Everyone on “campus” got far too much.A pattern, but not universal. Academia followed it, last time I was there. Federal employment might. The average salary is grotesquely high, but a lot of the “visible” employees—the ones traditionally targeted for layoffs (maybe not this time)—really are broke.

                            In any normally prioritized society, every professional afflete is wildly overpaid. It is only because of the grotesque overprioritization of sportsball that these gibbering clowns are making more than your average plumber.

                                With all due respect, that “normally prioritized society” carries an unbearable amount of weight. E.g.  Michael Jordan. He was of course a racist clown who arguably ruined basketball.BUT – the actual cash he generated for those paying him was enormous. In the existing world he was vastly underpaid.  We might think that the money spent on the human flea circus that is the NBA is ridiculous.  I happen to think that the value of gold is also ridiculous.  But as the traders like to say, the market can stay wrong longer than you can stay solvent.Somewhat related – it seems clear that pro sports salaries would soar if teams were organized like law firms, with stars and established players as partners and rookies as associates.  And a general business manager and clerical employees to run but not own the business.I suspect the reason that model wouldn’t work is that the overall non professional skill set of the lawyers is not at all like the overall non professional skill set of the players.  But of course that reason is probably racist on many levels.

                        Not only that, they’re victims of racism despite being paid $10 million to chase a football, so the NFL writes racial propaganda like “END RACISM” in the end zones.
A clear example of this “racism” is O.J. Simpson, falsely accused of slashing two white people to death because Det. Fuhrman had said the word “nigger” ten years in the past but denied ever having said it in court.

Yes. It’s the drama they’ve written in their minds where they are courageously keeping the ship afloat and it’s constantly reinforced by their bubble. For the military it’s worse because they are constantly praised by normie for their “sacrifice” which leads to them thinking they are actually defending the country. The fact that we’ve had hordes invading us for decades while they’re overseas “defending democracy” never occurs to them as the very height of irony.Like Conan I draw strength from their wailing.

                    This is extremely common. I have a relative that is in a low end government job and he’s making $100k. This is someone with very few skills, and no college education (and you can tell from his writing). He’s CONSTANTLY droning on about how he could make more in the private sector. These people think everyone in the private sector is making $300k in finance or something. I can show him statistics on median incomes of different demographics, but the facts don’t matter. This is drilled into their heads from an early age.

            I’ve been following r/fednews for weeks now. They are becoming increasingly unhinged as they realize that their pleas towards “civil service” are falling on deaf ears. Now they’re just claiming the entire country is full of angry hateful miserable people and that firing them will cause a collapse of the entire USA. They don’t get it and they’ll never get it, but that’s fine. I also don’t necessarily blame them, they’ve lived their lives with insane job security and generous benefits for years. If they’re a member of the diversity crew, as we saw with the NSA, then they work at a job that caters to them for it. Now where I do blame them is that they seem to think that they are entitled to this relative luxury and we are all stupid idiot cavemen for not thinking the same thing.

I grew up in that bubble and I can remember one neighbor who owned a business.  And one taught at Georgetown.  Everyone else worked for the government.  And this was more than 50 years ago.  Add in all the NGOs and trade organizations and fedgov growth, and it’s a turbo cancer.  I doubt 5% of today’s bureaucrats could pass the old Civil Service Test (challenged asrayciss in 1972).  They still believe the old canard (which I remember hearing as a child) that poor civil servants were vastly underpaid compared to the private sector.  May they all find jobs at Panda Express.

                    Potomac Maryland was a cow town in the 1950s. It had a stop sign. For those from that area, they can ask their grandparents if they recall pre-1952ish DC. Farms and empty land even in places like Silver Spring. It all looked like “Back to the Future.”
All of that growth was at the hands of US citizens in the 48 (and then 50) states. People simply have no idea of the enormity of the theft that occurred. No clue.

                Yes, NoVa native here of your vintage. It truly boggles the mind. It has to be experienced to be believed. Every time I go home it’s worse. At least when we were kids the GS types had to go to work. My Mom’s neighbor is a senior NIH official and the guy goes to work once a month maybe. The restaurants are packed and modest houses sell for $1million.

                    Mike – People are notoriouslyresistant to change.  Old people in particular.  Yet today change merely for the sake of change is lauded, while people simultaneously cling to long disproven theories.  And all antihumanist change is labeled ‘progress.’  You see it even here, with so many older commenters.  I’ve done a 180 from how I was raised (from leftist sh*tlib to conservative) and then moved to ethno-nationalism/fascism from online reading and learning.  Sclerosis of the mind is as big a danger as dementia.

                    I think I understand your intent but I don’t believe in party labels or politics.  If it’s a genuine government “of the people” (as if Lincoln gave a damn what that was) you don’t need a supposedly ‘loyal’ opposition. Hungary’s Orban is not a dictator and his opposition is/was funded by US NGOS and EU bureaucrats.

                        I understand what you’re saying too, but the reality is, one party is flooding this country with illegals, giving us toilets, water faucets and gas cans that don’t work, making cars extraordinarily expensive in order to save Mother Gaia, is on a jihad against so-called fossil fuels, etc. Would they have gotten so out of hand if there were an actual opposition party keeping them in check? It’s effectively a one-party state and it was putting roadblocks in Trump’s way, meaning it was putting roadblocks in the voters’ way.

                The bureaucrats who think they are underpaid remind of the point made by Kevin Costner’s character in Bull Durham, that everyone who believes they lived a prior life was someone famous.  No one ever says they used to be Joe Schmoe.  Similarly, these “civil servants” all believe they would be high paid consultants or partners at Covington &amp; Burling, when their skillset is more suited to a manager of HR at a small company.

            “Just wait ’til they need our service. They’ll be sorry…”This is one of the ways government bureaucracies protect themselves.  When you try to reign in a bureaucracy with cuts, they always apply the cuts to the most public facing “service” they have.  Like if you try to cut the local board of education budget, they don’t layoff administrators and useless paper pushers, they fire teachers, increase class sizes, cut extracurricular activities, class trips, supplies and other things which harm the whole reason it exists.  Like how they shut down all the national parks when the gov does its shut-down routine, but keep things like USAID on autopilot.

                The bureaucracy exists to protect and expand the bureaucracy. I did notice a lot of people saying, after the last government shutdown, that they didn’t really notice anything at all change. That is because, of course, during the shutdown, the “essential” workers providing those services were still there and working and it was the useless paper pushers that got sent home.

                    I used to dread the DMV in DFW.  Moved to a White, rural county in another state.  Now the biggest ‘hassle’ is the 25 minute drive to town.  I deal with friendly, capable, heritage White Americans and everything is simple.  No language issues, no unnecessary complications, no stupid mistakes. Minimal waiting time, no diversity, no pain.  Same for dealing with the Post Office, and City Hall.  Love this place and this life.

                        I live around farmers and ranchers.  People hold doors open for others, smile warmly, wave as they pass on one lane roads, and call each other “sir” and “ma’am” in a charmingly informal manner.
I wasn’t raised as a farmer or a rancher but I feel like I am with my people.
The place that I moved away from has traffic that is approaching Seattle levels of bad, but not quite as bad as San Fran yet.  People cut each other off in unsafe manner.  Shark-like behavior.

I go to town once a week at most, and I have to drive a ways to drop offrecyclables and shop, but everyone smiles, holds doors, and uses what used to be known as ‘common courtesy.’  You forget how peaceful and pleasant life can be when you’re not immersed in the urban/suburban bubble amidst the strivers and the diversity.

                They can only get away with that so many times before people decide they really don’t need a publik skule sistum anymore. I know a teacher who was laid off for exactly that reason who rented a spot in a vacant strip mall and took paying custom. And was charging less than the day care center next door.
He’s making better money now than before, and has complete control over which kids are not allowed in his classroom. Last year, after a lot of public pressure on the officials, he got accredited.

And so long as he chooses a fairly innocuous name to incorporate his school under, no admissions department is going to do a deep-dive on the particulars of any school’s accreditation.

            The “learn to code” was topped by one pundit—perhaps even the president—stating that the automation of the auto production lines with “robots” would produce *new* jobs for those who repair and maintain such robots.  Now how stupid can you get?  The entire purpose of replacing workers with robots (also called “automation”) is to reduce the need for workers, not to replace one job with another.  It was then I began to have insight in just how stupid and duplicitous our political class was.

                Thing is, there is a sound economic principle behind it— productivity. The more productive the employee, the more you can pay him. That guy maintaining the robots is extremely productive, and well-paid. It’s a good job for him, but obviously it creates other problems for less productive and capable workers, like not having a job lol.It comes down to the question of what to do with mediocre people, frankly. Capitalism (in theory!) rewards excellence, productivity, efficiency, competitiveness. These are virtues, But it doesn’t seem like anyone thought about what to do with the losers, other than expecting them to bootstrap, labeling them useless eaters, or just letting them fail and be swept away. Some people simply don’t have that ability.It’s an intractable problem of the human condition, imo. There will always be winners and loser, and some portion of the winners will be psychopaths, some portion of the losers will be born to lose. And I suspect those people at the margins have a lot to do with problem of mediocrity. Kind of mind-bending.

                Chesterton’s Fence: a rule of thumb that suggests that you should never destroy a fence, change a rule or do away with a tradition until you understand why it’s there in the first place.So you believe we’ll be sorry to see these positions eliminated? I think not.Why? Because “Chesterton’s Fence” is already a pile of ruins.For years now, the Feds have taken a wrecking ball to rules and traditions across the country. They pushed for open borders. They decimated the middle class. They’ve pushed mentally ill boys into girls’ locker rooms. They’ve vilified and discriminated against White people, Christian people, and heterosexual people. In short, they’ve wrecked the very people and institutions that made the country a nice place to live.But now, firing the people who pushed and benefited from this wreckage is a step too far? I repeat, I think not.

                    All above taken in good consul.  However, I seem to sense we’ve accepted the premise that these workers “will be missed”?  In other words, they’re all doing hard and productive work and the RIF of even a small percentage will reduce workflow.What I’ve sensed is more towards the line in many agencies—not all—is that their function is inefficient, misdirected, and highly overstaffed, not that the agency is not necessary or without function.  Some exceptions aside, like USAID, and the Dept of Ed.What did it for me was the revelation that, what—something like only 6% of the Fed workforce was reporting to an office daily? And before we get too cocky wrt public employee overstaffing, remember Musk took over a private company, Twitter, and fired 80% of the staff without any observable performance problems.There are a lot of bullshit jobs out there.  UBI would be a more honest system of welfare.

                In the words of John McEnroe, “you can’t be serious!”My business has to deal with these government types. They all and I mean ALL seem to:— Work at home.— Work other jobs during working hours.— Never answer emails when they say they will.— Never call back when they say they will.They are lazier and dumber than fuck. I have seen things — invoices that get the wrong amounts, man hours galore to straighten out the simplest problem THEY cause. One invoice suddenly got ‘marked’ that they owed us over 1.4 million dollars for a $3,000 charge— WE corrected themA million dollar mistake to a person or small business is a major thing. Not to our valiant government folks, I think our bookkeeper annoyed the ‘supervisor’ when THEIR mistake was pointed out.It is SO BAD that I cannot be in the same office when someone is ‘on with the government’ folks. It is PAINFUL to even listen to.

                    Somebody said yesterday that real unemployment is 23% iirc. That’s already a depression, right? Funny money takes the place of make work, because employment isn’t considered important anymore. UBI, automation, AI, etc. The thought seems to be that labor is no longer required to produce value. FDR and Keynes start to look like transitional figures. Transition to insanity, but that’s just, like, my opinion, man. The fact that depression isn’t acknowledged could be evidence of insanity. Throw it on the pile with all the woke crap.edit: now that I think of it, maybe these poor gov’t workers are the last vestige of make work. The pain keeps moving up the socioeconomic ladder. We have elites feeling it now, but they still haven’t let go of tech replacing labor. My guess is they feel more pain, and it comes in time.

            “And now these federal employees want sympathy from US?”Yeah, tell me about it….For decades now, study after study has found that workers for the Fed’s, as well as State and local, are paid handsomely in relation to the private sector. How many times have we read of private sector eliminating pensions, while the benefits of such remain secure in the public sector? How many times during recessions have we seen private sector job losses rising while public sector jobs remain stable? Who in the hell ever heard of an 8 month severance pay for a voluntary resignation (I believe the UAW does not even get such severance packages)? How many of you “old timers” were taught that the public sector jobs are “secure” (in bad times) because they are paid poorly?No, the Fed employees lost all right to sympathy a couple of generations ago. That they protest so much is an indication how remote from the mainstream private sector worker they’ve become.Full disclaimer:  I had one of these “public sector jobs” for just about my entire life.  Make of that what you will—I won’t be a hypocrite.

Yes, the few capable may well take the payoff and be happy to be shut of their idiot coworkers, but increasingly incompetent workers are baked into the near future with the crisis of competence and the ever-shrinking pool of White people.

                Of the ones fired so far, well over 90% are assuredly leftists. Because they were hired in the last year or two. There may be a handful of unfortunates mixed in. At USAID, you can safely assume 100% were leftists, although I don’t believe most of them have been fired (yet), just placed on leave.

If I were in their shoes, I’d seriously consider resigning. If it turns out to be as corrupt as it looks, you want them going after you as a private citizen rather than an employee. It’s pretty hard to claw back a pension after it’s been awarded, but refusal to follow an employer’s instructions is cause for firing for insubordination, and that’s usually cause to deny the pension.

                What I have been told by an insider just recently is the workaround to the “baby with the bath water” problem.  Prior to such RIF’s those in power who make the decisions tend to meet with the most valued employees to discuss “futures” and to “calm nerves”.  In short, it’s a wink-wink, nudge-nudge kind of thing designed to keep the “good ones” from jumping ship.  This of course takes an extremely tight organization that has built trust as a company goal.It seems the way the Fed’s have attempted a RIF will indeed incentivize those (better) employees to jump ship as they—if anyone—can find alternative employment in the private sector, or simply retire early.

                Why isn’t the NYT written entirely by an LLM nowadays? Their material is exactly the formulaic, derivative garbage the LLMs are masters of. Hell, if I knew the right people I’d get a “job” there as a staff writer (probably making, what, like $300,000/yr). Then I’d think up a prompt every other day and have the AI monkeys write the articles. For all I know, this IS how they do it now.

Censorship has been so thorough and successful that all normal attitudes are considered nazism. “That’s how you get actual nazis,” some hope. Not really. Mustache man comes when the revolution (Jewish communist in Germany’s case)persists in failure.
Trump and the “bros” may accidentally generate that condition. Someone in there may have considered it possible and pushed anti-antisemitism laws—even unpassed laws generatecustoms—in anticipation. The counter-counter-revolution came and we missed it?

        Getting away from this concept that we are fighting in the “marketplace of ideas” and accepting that (A) these people mean what they say, (B) they hate you and want you dead, and (C) they will always double down on their beliefs, is absolutely critical. It needs to happen. The media is shocked that Trump is treating them like the enemies they are, and not the dispassionate and objective people of reason that they want us to think they are. This also means their attacks won’t work. If you think the media is a purveyor of truth, then their attacks on Orange Man Bad carry water. If you know the media is the enemy of the people, then their attacks are expected and can be ignored. They know this as well as we do.

        I suspect this is just a brief lull in the cycle of world stupidity. The left won’t quit despite the incredible setbacks thanks to Trump and his team. Of course you can eliminate DEI in the workplace and stop the alphabet teachings in school. But just like immigration and demographic changes in Europe, we are way past the tipping point in declining morality and mental health.Brain washed millennials are now raising the same left-leaning imbeciles and this isn’t going to stop anytime soon. The past two generations have been drugged and dumbed down to the point they can no longer think for themselves. Youtube, TicTok and other site only promote and highlight the narcissus values that infest our schools and workplaces.Team Trump may be making great strides but he’s barely off the starting block. He has approximately 1,450 days total in office over the next four years. So far he’s completed less than 3% of his total time in office. Fantastic effort and results so far, no question. But this is a long distance run, not a sprint.The question is how long he and his team can keep up this pace. Hopefully for the full term in office. But he still has a long way to go and hasn’t even hit the hurdles the left is going to set up further down the track.

                I sure hope so. Here in Germany it will be interesting if the AfD can gain traction outside the old East German states. Until it really gains popularity in the western German states (Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, etc.) it’s going to be an uphill battle especially as the CDU and CSU close ranks against them.

                    I think what’s really at work is they are vastly more polarized than before, depending on which end of the stick is offered to them. White kids have now grown up being handed the sh*t end, and resent it. Either that or they are the crazies and love it. And the crazies vote with the diversity.
It’s mostly that the “based” had more of a reason to show up, so exit polls look really good, while the colleges give a pretty decent predictor of how they are going to turn out.

                        Agreed.  The shrinking number of normal young White males are definitely moving right, but they are outnumbered by the soiboys and all the White womyn.  I don’t even count all the non-Whites, because their “Americanness” is at best a thin patina covering generations of alien, tribal genetics. But if there is ever to be a White homeland, a boiling off has to happen.  You cannot build upon a foundation of sand. We needrock solid men.

                    It is true that the white men among them are more Republican than other living generations. (Gen X is more rightist by some measures and more Republican in some polls—but also more “woke” etc.) The pattern repeats across the white world.The deeper pattern is white men becoming an ever more excluded and impoverished minority, especially in England, the core of their civilization. It doesn’t matter how they vote or what they want. The advantage of this, if it is an advantage, is feeling freer to dissent, typically in such mild ways as supportingBrexit &amp; Trump.Those mild things arelast stands. Brexit was crushed and England ended. Trump probably has been too, but maybe not entirely. The rest of the West isn’t suddenly threatening to nuke America for no reason. (They also have childish and womanly reasons, of course.)If we had a world, it would be improving. That’s what’s left of hope.

        Zman has commented extensively on the Cloud-Dirt dialectic. The media Narrative is just another dimension of this dialectic. The crazies don’t realize that their Narrative got so ridiculously detached from reality that it lost credibility. You could BS people about foreign aid, a few cholos in their neighborhood, Obamacare and “fairness/access” blah blah for a long time. But eventually the levies broke under the pressure of the floodwaters of reality – 50%+ price increases for everything, neighborhoods overrun by illegals, the DOGE revelations etc. This is the history of all corrupt regime propaganda – it’s hard to “spin” the presence barbarians at the gates.

        This paragraph is key:It is hard for normal people to accept that the writer is as crazy as it seems. After all, he had to have sat in meetings at the New York Times where people boasted of ruining critics of the Biden regime. He must be aware of the doxing campaigns and the hooded terrorist gangs sent to harass dissidents. It is inconceivable to a normal person that this guy does not see the irony in what he is writing. The truth is he is that crazy and the audience is right there with him.I was guilt of the conservative “rational” bias. But my best friend (who spent most of his life around liberals) always said they were always that crazy. When I said the same thing about the mainstream media about how can they not see the irony in what they say and do, my friend said liberals have no insight. They are like mentally ill people in that the latter also completely lack insight.Leftism has degenerated into a cult of the mentally ill.

            It can be confusing because the mental illness is somewhat siloed off from their normal daily functions.  So they can support themselves and appear nice to others, until the door on the silo is opened and you see the crazy.  I have some acquaintances who are like this, and I simply refuse to get baited into any kind of political discussion with them, because I would just be arguing with the TV.  It’s like the old line about never trying to teach a pig to sing.  It’s a waste of your time and it irritates the pig.

                The cure for all this ‘confusion,’ of course, is a two-weeks long power outage.
It needs to be 10-14 days long to achieve the needed reset.
Afterwards, I guarantee you, the “soyboyz” will be on the run, and our Women-folk will back on nature’s enduring program.

        “The crazies will not simply go away. They must be defeated, caged, and only released when the conditions that created them are eradicated.”Call me crazy but I think the communists, national socialists &amp; hardline dictators throughout history had the right idea in removing these people for good. The methodology doesn’t have to be as extreme, we have a past precedent of lobotomizing &amp; sterilizing retards, nutcases, freaks &amp; degenerates &amp; keeping them locked up in asylums.That was considered completely normal before the small hats &amp; bleeding hearts convinced everyone psychiatric drugs transformed maladaptive degenerates into civilized people. We see how that turned out.

            When confronted with irreconcilable political disagreements, many traditional whites adopt a “live and let live” attitude.  They imagine that people with radically different politics can just separate and leave each other alone.
But no one else besides traditional whites feels this “live and let live” attitude, yet they continue to project it upon everyone else.
Traditional whites must learn that those who are committed to overthrowing them will not change and must be removed from their society.  Parable of the Scorpion and the Frog.

                The failed state and the failed neighbor are good homologs. A state which does not treat it’s people right is a failed state and does not have any reason to exist. A man who does not treat his family right is a failed neighbor, and also has no reason to exist.
Further, whether failed state or failed neighbor, they are a threat to you. You cannot tolerate either within striking distance of you. Whether exile or execution is a matter of personal preference. I’m not one who believes behavior that complex is coded in DNA.

                    Maybe not every single behavior, but I tend to believe certain general attributes are encoded in DNA.  That does not mean they cannot be overcome, but it takes a lot more effort both from the individual and the society in which he finds himself.

                Unfortunately as long as we’re in this current system the vast majority of Whites will not make that mental leap. As long as there’s subversive leaders telling the masses that brown savages are moments away from adopting western values &amp; the people themselves can White flight away to avoid ever having to accept reality this will keep going.There is an end point but it’s like letting a tumor get to stage IV &amp; spread across the whole body. By that point the host will be near death &amp; the solution will bring it even closer to the brink.The underlying flaw of the conservative mind is sentimentality which goes together with leftist subversion like peanut butter &amp; jelly do. Its always been there &amp; I’m not sure it can ever be eradicated, at least not with modernity making people soft &amp; tolerant. Whites were a victim of their own success in that way.Having said that, the subversives are entirely dependent on the system so the closer they get to wiping out &amp; nullifying the traditional Whites who prop it up the more precarious the position they find themselves in.When the day comes that traditional Whites can assert power they must show no mercy to any subversive &amp; they must not allow those sentimental conservatives to have any influence. The otherwise decent natured people who are not intentionally the enemy but are in actual practice due to their inability to grasp the nature of subversives are the ones who always open the door for the wolves to come in.The same sentimentality that they show to brown savages was originally &amp; still is applied to the inter species predatory Whites &amp; racial aliens employing crypsis. Thats how we got here, in a sane society these conservatives wouldn’t be allowed to influence things outside of their immediate surroundings or have a say over anything important. Democracy essentially engineered those who would’ve been otherwise fine people to become the foot soldiers of the predators. It allowed subversive leaders into positions where they could prey on the population’s penchant for psychological projection.Unfortunately I think the chicken that laid the democracy &amp; universalism egg was that very same projection &amp; sense of sentimentality. The ratio of good versus bad influence that combo has had for Whites is so ridiculously stacked in favor of the latter that I think it needs to be viewed as a fatal flaw that should be suppressed rather than a virtue to be embraced.

            A lot of the problem we have with these people owes to the fact that they’ve been riding a gravy train we’ve been forced to pay for. This amplifies their opinions and countless offices, both in the government and “private sector” are Leftist hothouses where they reinforce each other and organize. There are many such places where groups of employees carpool to protests together and use company (or govt.) time to make their stupid little signs.The DOGE strategy of cutting off the money, if followed through, will eventually scatter these people to places where their ideas and beliefs are not dominant. Once there, they will often be humbled by having to take jobs that don’t make them feel important or powerful at all. Of course, the decent people in those places will not like this outcome.Ultimately, we need to realize that there’s just not enough real work for everyone. We’ve created a lot of this “cloud people” class as a kind of very expensive day care for the “smart kids” who are good at filling in ovals with no. 2 pencils but don’t actually know how to do anything useful. Perhaps if Trump’s re-industrialization efforts pan out some of these people can be retrained as skilled labor. As long as they are never allowed to concentrate themselves in places and roles where they can write their own paychecks again we may be able to rebuild a somewhat sane and more normal society.

        I like the comparison to post-Soviet Russia and our road to recovery. It would seem however, that we face a much tougher challenge just on the human capital side. Your average Soviet citizen understood their government was always lying, as the old saw “they pretended to pay us and we pretended to work” illustrates. In the GAE, we are dealing with a significant portion (30%? 40%?) of our population that is- what is the medical term?- bat shit crazy. Plus all the hostile foreigners we’ve imported. The Soviets had and maintained their Russian pride and connections to their history and people. We have no such strength. Our social capital is completely gone. It can be rebuilt but it will take much longer.

Never forget, the Church (Orthodox) was big in the old USSR—but underground.  Putin took office and embraced the Church as the one enduring institution of the people.  I believe without such, he’d not have succeeded. God help us.

        I think the mental change one must go through is simply the observation that, you know, we really don’t have to convince anyone of anything. All we have to do is win. Or as St. Louis put it: you argue with a blasphemer by sticking a sword in his belly.But people either don’t really have viewpoints, in which case they simply do as the winners tell them, or else they have viewpoints they cannot be argued out of. In that case, you just de-fund them. It’s not complicated. What’s complicated is making sure the guys with guns will enforce your will.

            Yes, in the end all that matters is seizing and making use of power. Rational argument, democracy and all the rest were always luxuries that made sense contingent on the existence of a traditional Western society. We no longer have that.

            It’s called “projection”.  They assume all others must want the same things as them, hence beaners becoming “natural conservatives”.
Kind of like how Hebrews project that Germany must have holocausted them, because that’s what they would do if they had dominion over other tribes, as evidenced by their behavior towards Gaza or the Book of Joshua.

Ohmigosh. This is such a fantastic realization.
As is the second paragraph, but for some reason, that one was obvious.Just an unfinished thought, but it’s got me thinking. It rings a bell for some reason.

            It’s not without reason, though. Up until very recently, the ones coming here were mostly interested in the American Dream, not the gibs. They still do come here to succeed, but not the overwhelming fraction. And most civnats I know are fairly well-to-do, so don’t encounter the freeloaders, but rather the motivated ones who are joining country clubs.

                Sorry, but you are dead wrong.  I was a visa officer back in the 1980s, and no one was coming for the fictional “American Dream.”  They all wanted $$$$ to flaunt back home and to live they way all the ‘influencers’ and Tiktok womyn do now.  I can think of ONE immigrant visa applicant who had genuine work receipts from doing hard labor and a stable nuclear family.  The rest were all liars, frauds, and grifters.

                    I personally know many in the Sh*tCongo area.
That’s why things like IKAGO and Gell-Mann fall short. Because Because I only associate with successful people, everyone I associate with is successful, regardless of nationality. That’s not uncommon for civnats. You are arguing not against irrationality or superstition, but against personal knowledge to the contrary.
I need to temper that with Sh*tCongo crime stats, or FBI crime stats, or Arthur’s page or something. But Arthur’s page is not something I can send a civnat to, either. Taylor is shocking enough.

                        Depends on what you mean by “successful.”  Some of the aliens climb the ladder; a tiny number may even eventually genuinely assimilate over generations.  But this is not true for the vast majority.  I like money and the comforts it brings as much as the next guy, but I like community and people “of my own stock” more.https://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poem/poems_stranger.htm

                            Agreed. I’m speaking only of what some economists call “market entrepreneurs”, not “political entrepreneurs”. The latter make their money by exploiting government favoritism, so includes people like Musk and Vivismarmy.
I despise golf, but for business reasons, I have to play occasionally, and at some of the ritzier country clubs, the plurality or maybe even majority of new money “market” types are the diversity. Sadly, the white males are largely old money legacies.

                I’ve got agree with 3g4me here, but from a different angle. You could both be right—even. Those immigrants legal and illegal are usually working in some fashion, but in a welfare State such as we have *never* produced more than they receive in benefits outside of wages. Years ago I took a look at some stat’s from United Way in CA which they presented to the legislature in Sacramento. 80% of new immigrants were using welfare benefits (all types), while first generation (their children) had 40+% receiving welfare benefits.An example of the UW computation, public schooling. At that time, it cost $12k for one year in k-12. An immigrant family that drops two kids might be expected to burn through $24k of public funds for 12 years. The ability of such a family to pay State taxes in the amount approaching $300k was basically nil—and public schooling is not all the welfare bene’s they are eligible for.In short, we don’t need most immigrants as they were arriving as they were of no overall economic benefit.

Is Ramaswarthy American because he’s a “winner”?
I feel like the conflation of those things is a recent concept, but then maybe the stereotype of Americans has some truth to it, that it’s a land of prosperity gospel grifters ( a la Trump).

            Civnats actually have a “fundamentalist” interpretation of the writings of the Founding Fathers. The FF’s themselves were just using flowery 18th century rhetoric as a way of arguing against monarchy and in favor of a (verylimited) sort of democracy. They didn’t delineate all the boundaries and caveats that were obvious to them and even the people they were opposing.Today’s civnat goofballs take all that stuff literally and in the interest of bending reality to their ideology have created the gynocentric system of racial Communism that we are forced to call “America”. They’ve pushed the system to the point where it has challenged reality to a duel – and lost.

        Down at the very bottom of the NYT piece, there is a short bio on Peter Baker. Says he is covering his sixth presidency. That takes us back to 1992, or perhaps 1988. It is good that Trump stands out to him in contrast. His “sin” is not so much in seeing Trump is radical as it is in seeing the way things were done in that era as normal or desirable. The “solution” to “dealing” with such people is not to reason with them, or try to negotiate with them (like the civnat right), but to ignore them, to ride roughshod over them, to make them irrelevant. That’s the one thing they can’t deal with.All Trump All The Time (ATATT) seems to be our new reality. Even The Zman is not immune. Nor am I. I can’t say that it’s unwarranted either, we are witnessing important events in momentous times. It’s not so much a question of what else is going on in the world, but rather a question of is there anything else going on in the world? In this world, we are either Trump, or we are watching Trump.

Or perhaps no more than January 19, 2001. One piece on the Clinton exit would have been enough for these clowns to claim he had covered the Clinton Presidency.
“All Trump All The Time (ATATT) seems to be our new reality.“
I hope that’s the strategy. Keep the crazies distracted screaming about Trump while his various teams (like Elon, and I doubt he’s the only one, just the most visible one) are busy drafting new EOs for him to sign.

        There is definitely a doubling down instead of a reevaluation and modification, and it is seen most clearly in corporate advertising, which is the ultimate barometer of the Power Structure. Hence, if you thought you saw blak, blak, blakitty blak before, well you ain’t seen nothing yet. The blackwashing of the culture has become even more extreme and comprehensive, and I didn’t think that was possible. It’s enough to generate perpetual nausea in any normal person.

Nupe.

They’ll need to be de-programmed and introduced — gradually — to reality and the truth.  Burn down their inner strongholds.
It’d take a full spiritual and cultural transformation, and I’d expect an unprecedented time of trouble, for the spirit of that trouble long has been ensconced and enthroned in the land.

        “The writer genuinely believes Washington is being taken over by a Stalin-like figure and he and his coreligionists are the beginnings of a great resistance to it.”They felt the same way with Trump 1.0, although Trump 1.0 did nothing. And G.W. Bush was Hitler. And Reagan… Whatever the other team does, they react the same way.So the Right can do whatever they want, because there are no consequences. This is the strategy the Right has not understood until now. They were scared to act lest they were being called all kinds of dirty words, but the dirty words are the same, regardless of the actions the Right does.

In short, those NAZI’s not put on trial were denied positions of any authority in the new regime.  Something similar to the program of “Black Listing” practiced by US companies in the 50’s to exclude Communists seems necessary.At best, we’ll get one chance at this.  Make the most of it.

        One of the many failings of conservatism was the insistence that with just the right argument using just the right data points, the people they called the left would throw down their weapons and embrace them as brothers.The topic of what one then does after this is revealed as false is one that this post doesn’t even really address.Given that these people cannot be reasoned out of their beliefs, what are the alternatives.Maybe some can be frightened out of their beliefs. They may not actually change, but they will be too cowed to act, and they will make the appropriate noises and keep their true thoughts to themselves, just as too many on the right did for decades.Maybe some will just follow the strong horse — the popular trend. Most of the population is made up of followers.But not all.And the ones that fall into “not all” are relentless enemies. They will continue to try to subvert and undermine the normal … as long as they draw breath.

        Think you hit it:
“The employees of Jeff Bezos at the Washington Post stillthinkthey get to tell the owner of the company to buzz off and leave the running of it to them.”
It’s the very same warped mindset that gives govt workers this idea that they’re entitled to their jobs, can’t be fired or expected to even show up. When called for accountability it’s tantamount to a war crime, hence the howls of outrage.
Actually ”warped” doesn’t begin do it justice,’possibly “diseased”?

        “Politic is about morality, not facts. It is also about power…”I would argue that politics is exclusively about power and money – same thing, I guess.I am deeply glad to be seeing some optimism beginning to break out among the dissidents. The world is changing. After the Freak Administration Americans, even the normies and griller like me – are beginning to see the light. We see it in the current hen fights that have broken out on the left. Joy Reid recently got fired. The menopausal hags on The View are facing crippling lawsuits. The money supply has been cut off to the media regime. Fags like Dawn Lemon have been turfed.The NYT is hemhorraging ratings and subscribers. The jews are finally facing increased scrutiny and critique.It may seem like small steps but the fact is the Dissidents have made an incredible impact. That retarded geezer, Mitch McConnel was forced into “early” retirement. General Milley could conceivably face a courts martial.This HAS to be the new strategy for going forward. The lunatics and traitors and money grubbers must be punished according to the law, and people need to see it being done. The shitbirds themselves must see it and be made accountable for what they’ve done. If it isn’t… things will be quite dire for the next election that goes the wrong way or all thosr people will be back and madder than hell in seeking vengeance.An excellent piece – there is still much to do… but… it will take time, effort, and sacrifice to bring it about.Keep it up, Dissidents! You have done remarkably well.

        “They must be defeated, caged, and only released when the conditions that created them are eradicated.”
Agreed. While the intelligence agencies remain corrupt and bloated and there are bad actors overseeing our voter rolls they can only be considered temporarily sidelined. That story about Florida voter rolls raises all kinds of questions about who is actually running the NSA, FBI and other agencies and how extensive their influence is on our country.

            In context, this quote is likely talking about someone pretty good.  Serling was a major propagandist and he was quite proud of it.  I saw him on an interview bragging about how the network let him turn the show into political and social propaganda.While I agree the show is pretty good and I have several seasons on DVD, many of the episodes are just left-wing propaganda.  IIRC, there is one episode where the sun doesn’t rise to prevent a hanging because of hate or something.  There is another where a guy they label a “nazi” is reporting communists to the government, again because of hate or something.

                No question about it. Serling was a Leftist. But like the Coen brothers–who I assume are also Leftists–he sometimes produced rightwing material, not to mention superb content that was entirely apolitical.
I’ve got the entire series on DVD. There are around 130 episodes worthy of repeated viewing. The other 25 or so–either propagandistic or poorly made–I simply do not watch.

        The universal “truths” of the media, which were hammered ceaselessly into the forebrains of readers and viewers, was that the reporter was part of a special caste of truth diggers, that titanic forces thirsted to block the revelation of this truth and that the reporter did all this not for a paycheck but out of the goodness of his heart. 💓 Cynical interpretations of the media were forbidden. The media clearly loves itself. It has no self-esteem problem. High on the power of the medium, enamored of its own mind games, the spin doctor aka “reporter” conjures up crises to feel important and/or stoke those ratings. It’s all a sordid game.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
