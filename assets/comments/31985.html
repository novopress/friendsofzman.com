        No argument really persuaded me of anything. It was simply a matter of reality no longer according with the things I had been told. I grew up in the burbs and had a very “magical” view of diversity. Black people meant Michael Jordan leaping over people’s heads to slam dunk, or stoical black soldiers enduring persecution at the hands of white redneck sadists, like I saw inGlory.A few years later I wasn’t living in the suburbs anymore and I was in a school that was something like 50 percent black. I remember a couple clarifying moments. One was when OJ was announced as “not guilty” and all the black kids in our classroom started dancing. Another was a time I was at a takeout restaurant, waiting in line behind a black kid bitching at the sandwich maker behind the counter. The “sandwich artist” was more bemused than pissed (probably stoned, too) and finally just asked, “How can I make you happy?” to which the black kid responded, “You can’t make me happy.” A lightbulb went off. “We can’t make these people happy” or wipe the slate clean, or live with them, and each concession leads to demands for more concessions.This was all subconscious, though. It wasn’t until my time in the army, seeing hard and genuine balkanization in the Middle East—or the Third World up close on the Texas-Mexico border—that I changed. I think the first genuinely heterodox thinker I encountered was Thrasymachus at Deconstructing Leftism. He wasn’t just cataloguing bad black behavior, like Paul Kersey, or larping with Stahlhelme and Sig Runes with alienated white weirdos in chatrooms. He was trying to understand how and why we got here, and how to get out.There’s no going back after that, and after several years of excruciating day-walking, I escaped and now work for myself. I snapped a couple times day-walking, like once pigeonholing a feminist professor from England and asking her why feminists ignored the grooming scandals. Not only did she not answer, but she avoided looking me in the eye. And a lot of my papers started coming back as B’s instead of A’s for some strange reason. Now, though, there’s no more cognitive dissonance, and a lot more peace. That’s another thing the 1.0 crowd got wrong: all the obsession with runic esoterica and rage clouded their minds. Being calm is a precondition to getting anything done. And “wearing the Nazi outfit” is conceding that what you want is in some way immoral. The way forward is going to look a lot more like J.D. Vance or Jared Taylor. I’m pro-white and there’s nothing unreasonable about that. It’s about as sinister as raising a family and attending a church picnic. The people telling you I’m sinister are unhappy, mentally ill mutants, or, like Morris Dees and Jonathan Greenblatt, they’re greed heads and bad actors.

            joey junger:  I was with you up to J.D. Vance.  So the way forward is to denounce your hillbilly family and roots, write about it to suck up to the leftist political glitterati, marry a subcon and produce brown children?  Because that’s what ultimately endures – one’s family and children, not one’s politics.  Vance’s choice is the essence of White negation.

                Yep, that’s my biggest problem with him as well. It’s not just the racial mixing, but it’s also cultural and religious. Too much more of that, and you get a mishmash of people that this country was never intended to be.

                I’m not saying to do what J.D. Vance does, but that’s a lot more what the presentation should look like. His approach will reach people who would literally rather die than follow Fuentes over a hill. Also, our fight for survival doesn’t really require a lot of big articles, like the Alt Right’s leftovers continue to insist on doing. Casting runes with the Countercurrents crowd or writing ten-thousand word articles on the Hegelian implications of Beyonce’s latest auto-tuned hit, like a lot of those erudite guys do. It’s a waste of brainpower. I saw where they or Arktos have a new book out called “Esoteric Trumpism.” That’s pretty oxymoronic. Also, I stay away from the Moldbug / Vox Day types, who are basically running their own Society For Creative Anachronism. I’m not knocking their hobby, as those Warhammer figurines aren’t going to paint themselves, and the grilled mutton at the Ren Fair is probably tasty, and maybe you can even find a future trad wife among the busty corseted serving wenches. But it’s another form of larping.

                    Pretty well agree with everything you wrote here. I would never vote for or accept a Pajeet as leader, but much can be learned from anyone. The key is to have a white person deliver the same message as King Cobra is just as acceptable of a way.
You are absolutely correct about the LARPing, too. It is loathsome.

                        Yeah, but good luck finding a white person who will deliver the same message as King Cobra. The only ones who will touch it are alreadypersona non grata.

                    Agree on keeping away from the larping and personality cults, but the brown wife and kids is a deal breaker for me.  In general, in my experience, it’s the non-White wife’s family that provides a bigger influence on mixed kids than the White father – and given Vance’s own denouncing of his admittedly dysfunctional family, I see that playing out here.  His own kids are not White, will not ‘identify’ as White, and are only tenuously connected to Western Civilization.

                        On the political side of things, the US House of Representatives just voted as follows, concerning the question of whether U.S. Citizens [and onlyU.S. Citizens] are to be counted in the nation’s census:
GOP:206 yeaDEM: 202 nay
In other words, there were precisely ZERO Whites in the DEM party who were willing to stand up and go on the record as requiring citizenship.

                    With you about Counter-Currents. I scan it maybe once a week because now and then I find an article worth my time. Actually their heavy hitters like Jim Goad and Greg Johnson are talented stylists, as is Mark Gullick in the house comedian role.The frustrating thing, though, is that while Goad et al. usually say things I agree with, important things even, I never find their work very interesting because it’s all from the recycling bin. Once you see the topic you know what they’ll say about it, albeit in good prose. Other than perhaps for brand-new readers (I doubt there are many) there’s nothing to learn from those revised standard versions. No imagination is at work, no surprises.(I’m sorry to say that’s equally true of Jared Taylor at AmRen, an honorable man with worthy intentions. AmRen has long been just a place where conventional conservatives go to register their gripes. I wonder if a single mind has ever been changed there.)Jim Goad and his crew come off like the last word in wit and wisdom, however, compared with other contributors to the site. The others’ mode of operation largely consists of long —long— critiques of obscure and forgotten white-race supporters. Sure, anyone who has risked reputation and fortune by publicly standing up for whites deserves recognition, but not that way.And then there are the “philosophical” essays that clock in at 7,000 words plus. I have trouble believing anyone in the intended audience actually reads them, let alone is influenced by them.Let’s not forget — I wish I could — movie essayists Travis LeBlanc and Trevor Lynch, who spend immeasurable time and energy burrowing into films (the more commonplace and commercial the better) to find hidden (because they don’t really exist) gems of deep significance for the pro-white movement. In my college English classes, the equivalent academic procedure was called “explicating” sources like 19th-century short stories. It was also known, less approvingly, as “reading in.” Like going over every paragraph with a Geiger counter to pick up trace emissions of what you were looking to find.All right, I’m being hard on the Counter-Currents team. They are doing the best they know how to do in a good cause, and I admire their commitment even if I think how they operate loses friends and influences few people. But why can’t the dissident right come up with its own media that are both intellectually sound andenjoyable?By the way, Z-man, your site accomplishes that more than any other known to me. That’s why I’m here.

                    Counter-Currents is Greg Johnson, who is gay, right?I always thought that’s what happened between him and Roger A. Sphincter, jilted lovers sort of thing. yaaaath.Moldbug is Jewish.Taylor’s wife is also Jewish(?)That other boomer’s wife is Chinese.I haven’t really paid a moment’s notice to Vox Day since he, Cernovich and Molyneux had a thing going, which was back in like ’17?He mostly just seems like a goon. Not a great asset but not particularly detrimental either. “Mostly Harmless”.At this point the middle/’high’ brow right in the US seems more controlled zio-op than the freedom-trucker/MAGAt tier stuff.btw:“Busty Corseted Serving Wench“.username available.Almost as good asChicano Studies Major.

                He sold out his people and even his own family for coin and recognition by people who hate him.  He is a snake in the grass.The funny thing is, he could have done largely the same thing but without being a traitor about it.  His whole hillbilly routine is to take the piss at his family and humiliate them.  He doesn’t want to help them in any way.There is a large White underclass who are drug addicted and extremely dysfunctional. It is now significantly larger than it was in the 80s and 90s.  The answer to this problem is not to make fun of them.

Wrong.That answers nothing.

                        Sure, I could have phrased it better.I really don’t have an answer other than to fix the economy.  We cannot have free trade with countries that have significantly lower costs than us.  Production equipment and techniques along with logistics are just no longer bound to physical place.  What happened is corp America fired their American workers, packed up the production equipment and moved production overseas.This system is evil. It’s a race to the bottom.  It has huge negative impacts on our Western developed economies and severe negative impacts in the third world.  China has been wrecked physically with pollution and is experiencing the bursting of one of the largest bubbles in human history.Now, all the people who used to work in manufacturing in America and secondary industries like suppliers and service providers are now unemployed, hopeless, poor and drug addicted.  That’s his family.  That’s his community. The former working and middle class.

                You can read Vance’s breeding with a subcon the other way – diluting their race with white admixture.  Wombs are more precious than sperm, and need more protection.  A white man impregnating non-white women dilutes the woman’s race more so than the man’s.
It’s why the sight of a white woman with mixed-race kids is so off-putting.  A white man with mixed-race kids is not as unnerving.  The former is an affront to the tribe, the latter is just a sort of misguided soul.

                Vance is not perfect by a long shot, but in politics you will never get a perfect leader.
Despite Vance’s shortcomings, he gave an utterly brilliant speech in the Senate a couple of weeks ago in which he said we need to stop with the idiotic thinking that every foreign policy issue is always Munich, 1938. He said verbatim “Putin is not Hitler.”
It’s worth watching:

                    This began in the sixties.My dad, born 1921, depression baby, WW11 Pacific veteran, self-made man and lawyer, became chief of the real estate division of the US Post Office in 1956. In 1968 he said he was thrilled to hire their first lawyer graduated from Harvard. Too late he was shocked to discover the guy was completely useless.About that time his secretary left to raise family and he was assigned a new one. I met her, nice lady. Forty words a minute. My dad told her he could never recommend a merit raise without learning to type sixty. She never did and he never did.He never spoke badly of a race or ethnic group although I suspected he held an aversion to Japanese after Okinawa. I had to garner all my bad attitudes by myself.

                    Knowing this stuff in the early 70’s wasn’t common but the handwriting was clearly on the wall.  An admin survey back then (not anonymous in those innocent times) of students at my Ivy League college had a “race/religion” question. One of my White Protestant buddies tossed it away, saying “I refuse to provide information that can only be used to discriminate against me”.

            I’m totally onboard with your train of thought, only I’m probably a few decades ahead of you. Since the 90’s I have been quietly but firmly calling out bullshit when it rears it’s head and stoically responding to the accusations of racism with, “so?” Ayn Rand was a huge idealist with her idea of the “perfect man” being born to guide us all to a capitalist Utopia, but she got something right in the speeches of Galt, Reardan and d’ Anconia. They WANT you to give their ideas credence. They NEED for you to agree with their premise and defend yourself. I refuse. I have been accused of being prejudiced by my own family to which my answer is “Yes”, followed by “So?”. There is never much after that. Once you take the morality from their argument, they’re done. But what about your job? Good question. I’ve never hired a minority (I’ve done &gt;100 direct hires in my career). I make sure to interview white candidates who are objectively better. When pressed to go all DEI, I ask for the request to hire a less qualified candidate in an e-mail. Never happens. I have actually filed complaints to HR that “discriminatory language” in the company is causing a hostile work environment. Should have seen their faces when I explained that the black “C” suite gatekeeper made rude comments about White people. This pretty much made me bullet proof as long as I kept my business nose clean. Be stealthy, be smart and be resolute.

                    Yep.  Netanyahu has demonstrated conclusively that he is a criminal sociopath.    The fact is most of the world has already turned on them and their benefactors in the West no longer have the conventional capability to deal with Iran.
The leadership in Israel may be quite capable of launching their nukes and not just because the state of Israel is threatened with extinction.  They may do so if their planned excursion into Lebanon fails.   We have no Western leaders to be the adults in the room.

                    Certainly. Israel had very little to do with campus radicalism–the first virulent irruption of AWR in the US–but postmodern, and to a lesser extent Frankfurt School philosophers had their fingers in that feculent pie. Then too, there were sociological factors at work.

Now their stupid students see brown people being blown up by Jews who look white enough.  So they protest and start noticing the Jews.

                            I can assure you America’s faculty in 1966 was not dominated by Finkels. And certainly nowhere near to the extent it is now. My larger point is that they didn’t immediately take over America the minute they debarked from Minsk. It took well over a century to reach peak Finkel. Just because they control the country now doesn’t mean they always did. And consequently, you can’t reasonably lay every terrible development in the past at their feet. We did a lot of this to ourselves.

Left-wing Jews – as embodied by the current Democratic party – primarily hate and want to destroy White people of European Christian background.Right-wing Jews – as embodied by the current Republican party – primarily support Israel and hate and want to destroy Arabs, Persians, and other mid-East Muslims.  In the end, they are one “uniparty” who will, when the chips are down, support each other against both enemies.

                    Thank you for bolstering my point. If you want to blame the Finkels for anti-white racism–and they certainly deserve a hefty chunk of the blame–then you need to home in on the domestics, not the Levantines.

                        Except that I think that there are many fulcrum points, for example the ADL and Chuck Schumer, and also numerous orgs and billionaires that are not household names, who bridge anti-White racism in White countries with Israel.  The Jewish corrosion of White countries could not have happened as it has with out the nest-of-vipers home base nation and sovereign private space as a foundation.  When they say that “Anti-Zionism is Anti-Semitism” and “Jews everything are not safe without their own ethnostate”, they are telling the truth – the Jewish dominations and malfeasance outside of Israel rests on the existence of Israel, and Israel’s mass murders are a perversion of but a central essence of Jewishness.

                            There was plenty of Jewish malefeasance before 1948. Just look at their prevalence within global communism and their spying on behalf of the USSR for evidence of that fact. Hell, Marx himself was a Finkel.

            The last 20 years have been perfect for Israel, they got rid of Saddam, the Arab spring weakened Egypt and others, Syria has been wreckedBut its all gone wrong, Iran has created a huge intractable problem for them, the Iranians now have the ability to hit Israel and any other country in the region, the Saudis are now running their one drone and missile program, they are doing this to counter Iran, but the same missiles could also hit Israel, If you were running Iraq you would also be interested in a missile programAt best I could see the US fight one more war for Israel, but that only lasts for maybe another decade, the 2030s will be a fascinating and dangerous decadeThey could try making peace with the Arabs, but thats not their style

                    The part about them never forgiving or forgetting must be foremost in our peoples minds. The other day when the creatures on The Herd were jubilant about the prospect of Trump going to jail, someone on X commented about how once Trump went to prison, his “followers” needed to be rounded up and “disposed of” as well. An hour later I was listening to a noon time  program and the host got into a spat with a caller over the protests. I can’t recall what the caller said, but the host shouted back, “Oh who the hell are you kidding, if the protesters ran the police department, they’d be rounding up their opposition and shooting them in the streets!”at the local bakery that I go to, there are a few patrons who openly speak about doing this, but they are older, mid-60’s. Ironically , the ones who call them out on it are the 20 somethings with multi-colored hair, go figure.

That the people they hate would respond in kind hasn’t even occurred to them, and that those people they hate would respond by coming after them, personally,alsohasn’t occurred to them.

        I think I’ve been on this side of the great divide for a while so I don’t have to be red-pilled about the GOP and Con., Inc. cucks, but I hope some of what we’ve been seeing and hearing lately does it for others. As low as my opinion is of the cucks, I’m still pretty surprised about their recent obsession over a bunch of pampered rich kids getting heckled on the grounds of some of America’s most expensive colleges. I’m even convinced that the protesting would have died out a long time ago if the cucks weren’t obsessing over and giving it attention 24/7 on the usual normie outlets. The country is circling the toilet bowl with rampant crime, foreign invasion and monetary collapse along with the fact that the ruling junta is stealing elections and trying to jail/Chauvin politcal opponents. Given that, I’m hoping a lot more people are now realizing how worthless the GOP and Con., Inc. are after seeing that only thing the cucks really care about is some rich Lefty kids getting trash-talked on their way to the Student Union.

            It’s not the Con Inc. that’s obsessed with the protests; it’s their boss, the small hats. Jews are obsessed with narrative and the protests mess up their narrative. Sure, the protesters are annoying anti-white rich kids, but they’re taking aim at Israel and thus Jews.Jews’ narrative – both to the world and themselves – is that they’re the ultimate victim, the ultimate good guy just trying to bring light into the world. The protests say otherwise and that can’t be allowed, so Jews have called out their minions on both sides of the isle, but it’s easier for the GOP to manipulate their flock.

                What particularly queers the Finkel narrative is that many of the protesters are non-white. The Finkels see themselves, with some justification, as the vanguard of the anti-white hellions and as the defender of all things non-white. So, when PoC visibly take up the cross against the Finkels it throws into grave doubt the immaculate righteousness of the Finkels on racial issues, and they’re panicking because of it. If the Finkels lose their mantle as the archangels of social justice, what do they have left to guarantee their imperviousness to examination, critique and attack?

        “Indians are the most ethnocentric people on earth”
Surely not more ethnocentric than America’s most beloved and oppressed minority?

            Nope. And also keep in mind that India is composed of any number of distinct ethnic groups. Also, they can’t match Jews in brain power, money, and global reach.

                Not yet. The Brahmins are taking it to the Jews. Cobra is just one example. The Brahmins are entering politics, the media, academia, tech, you name it. They’re not as organized as the Jews, but they play a similar game.
Also, Jews haven’t proven themselves particularly impressive outside of the West. I suspect a good part of their success is having an easy opponent – high-trust whites whom they look like. When Jews go up against other smart races who will never see them as their own, Jews don’t do much.

                    See my comment about the crooked nature of their behavior. Sure, when you work out side the established order, and the dullards who manage the established order are too stupid to see what’s going on or to do anything about it, you end up with things like all the newly minted Jewish billionaires of only in the last 30 or 40 years.

                Arshad Ali:  Au contraire.  They easily took the Brussels diamond trade away from the Jews.  Indians are far more numerous than Jews, and equally ethnocentric.  They also harbor a similar dislike for Whites, although it’s based more on envy (of ability and physiognomy) than an imagined chosen status.  Just like Jews, they begin by taking over offices and businesses with their compatriots, running for the school board and city council, etc.Thus far the Jews think they are in charge of a strategic anti-White partnership with Indians and the Han.  They remain confident in their supposed intelligence and money to keep them holding the whip hand.  In this they are wrong, of course, and those Jews in AINO will be genetically and culturally swamped in the coming years.

Americans Jews have never had to deal with people like themselves. So far, they aren’t doing very well against them.

                    Specifically the Gujarati Jains wiped the floor with Shlomo in the diamond biz. The Jains aren’t called the Jews of India for nothing. (The Parsees would be the Uber-Jews of India, and the Sindhi Diaspora the B-Team Jews of India, but that’s another story). It helped that the Jains control the cutting and polishing sweatshops of Surat, but beyond that for sure they’re clannish and high-trust within their own networks. And wicked smart when it comes to commercial acumen.There’s plenty of sub-80 IQ street-defecating Indians in India… What we ignore at our peril is that each different caste (oversimplifying) is effectively a silo-ed Race… each one highly specialised after 2K+ years of assortative mating, genetic bottle necks, etc., etc.Ashkenazi Jews developed a few specialised traits thanks to similar effects… but they all pretty much specialised in the same small subset of skills — verbal dexterity, symbol manipulation, legalistic gymnastics, etc.The Indians have at least tens of high-functioning ‘small’ (=the odd million or so members) castes of high IQ, highly specialised hereditary Uber-accountants, Uber-lawyers, Uber-traders, Uber-motel/gas station grubbers, and so on. And that’s fair enough if they’re in India dealing with each other.Letting them run loose in the West is suicidal. Hot knife meets butter.

                Such questions about which races are most ethnocentric are necessarily hard to quantify.  In terms of methodology, how do we determine which races are most ethnocentric?I find that watching for clashes between two groups, and noting who wins the conflict, is illuminating.  A good example of this was when the white feminists attacked rap in the 80s and 90s as misogynist.  The blacks clearly shut down the white feminists, so I concluded that blacks were more powerful than the white feminists.Can the same methodology be applied to the indians versus the chosen?My instincts say that the chosen are more ethnocentric, but my interactions with indians are not extensive.

                    I have a proposal. Let’s answer the question of who is most ethnocentric by being the most ethnocentric. That makes it much more simple and removes all moral confusion. War is declared on and waged against us.
We close ranks and own it. It will feel great too. That solves most of the problems right there. Young white boys will suddenly feel more like men and have a purpose.

                    Edward Dutton (HelloHelloHello!) wrote a book titled “Race Differences in Ethnocentrism.”   I don’t remember which group, Indians or Jews, he considered most ethnocentric.  He showed that South Asians and Arabs are more ethnocentric than East Asians and much more than Africans and Europeans.  He said Jews are extremely ethnocentric, essentially the opposite of Europeans.

                    The Jews are certainly aware of the Indian threat. Commenter Sultan Knish* has railed at some length about the Indian Tech Bro takeover of the high ground of Californian political power-broking. Reading him you were supposed to imagine that the lily-white heirs of Leland Stanford were being done out of their natural inheritance and not the Hollywood and Real Estate Usual Suspects who rolled Whitey in that neck of the woods a long time back.*Dan Greenfield — part of a Mossad blogging operation which includes Caroline Glick. Greenfield’s job there is to play to the Boomercon demographic and make Israel look like frontline in defence of all that is Mom and Apple Pie and Republican Party.

                “Ethnocentrism” in the Anglosphere is anti-whiteness, and Indians are definitely more anti-white than Jews are.Their idea of whiteness includes Jews—fully consciously, unlike blacks whose anti-whiteness is a placeholder for what would be antisemitism if they knew what Jews are—so they’re the most efficiently/effectively anti-white group. Jews have a blurred boundary where they make individual us/them/ourguy distinctions. Indians don’t.Whites out.
Asians (the good ones) are increasingly like this, too.

                The frequency of Jewish outmarriage suggests you are correct. Indians, OTOH, marry their own kind.Relatedly, circa 1993 there was a reasonably cute Indian girl with whom I had a few Russian classes. We were friendly, although I had no designs on her. Well, one evening I stroll into a corner store to snag a pack of smokes and this girl is behind the register. (Turns out her family owned the joint.) We got to talking and perhaps flirting a bit, and then all the positive expressions on her face immediately turned negative. She nervously whispered to me that she had to get back to work. It was then I noticed three young Indian men in the corner of the store looking the both of us three shades of hell. I chuckled to myself and walked out of the store. I can only presume they were her brothers and they absolutely did not approve of her consorting with a Blue-eyed Ice Devil. I learned something about the Indians that night.

        I think the first glimmer I had about what I think now was many years ago when I observed a distinct lack of diversity in the libertarian circles I frequented. The guy I mentioned it to was taken aback by me stating such so plainly. But the point still stood that for some reason the minorities just didn’t care about “free markets and free minds.” I’ve since realized there’s many other things they don’t care about. Republicans think the same way, thinking if they just make the right argument the black vote will be theirs. Or some other minority. It’s all so tiresome.

                I still have a soft spot in my heart for Yarvin and company. I read some of the Moldbug stuff back when I was still mostly a liberal. It didn’t make me part of the DR (which didn’t exist yet) but it did result in my getting exiled by my lefty friends. I realized these people were not free thinkers when it came to things like HBD.

            The only *real* break from the Democrats among blacks was when the various lawfare campaigns against Trump started. Some blacks then saw a parallel between Trump being railroaded over his “crimes” and the way they often get treated by the DA. Whether their perception of injustice over their often very real crimes is correct it’s impossible not to see the connection or to note that the recent black increase in approval for Trump was not due to them being convinced by Trump’s “positions on the issues”.Overall, it’s Whites who think ideologically. This even goes back to the 19th and 20th century fights between Bolsheviks and fascists. Browns and blacks think in much more concrete terms and tend to simply support whatever is good for their tribe. Maybe it’s not too late for Whitey to learn this. Save your abstract thinking energy for science and math! Most politics is no more abstract than a drunken bar brawl.

        No doubt a lot of White people, in 2020-2021, when the media was blasting out “cut down the tall trees” rhetoric every day, looked at their hands and realized what these people had in store for them. Once other, braver people start talking about it more openly, it becomes very easy to shift the conversation because people are already thinking it.Israel’s behavior has been so cartoonishly evil, so reckless, so out of control, so dangerous for the entire world, that it is basically impossible for any normal thinking person to support them, or the American and “American” leaders who prop them up and shill for them. I never thought I would see such a drastic shift in public opinion towards Israel, but as they say, things happen slowly, then all at once.

        Thank you for the Coulter/Ramaswamy report. I would comment upon a few more points here. Ramaswamy is U.S. born but 100% ethnic Indian/Hindu (source: Wikipedia). Dot Indians are in the low single digits in terms of percentage of U.S. population. But what I speculate is that Coulter got away with her comment at Ramaswamy not because he’s an ethnic minority, but the fact that he is not a pet  minority (racial or other). In short, he’s not Black, Jewish, female, lesbian, a tranny, a left-handed pederast, or whatever. Had Ann dared make the same statement at one of those magic unicorns, she would be receiving the full treatment by our ZOG media.

            Coulter has a history of “outlandish” statements.  She took on the windows of the 9/11 victims who wanted even more money for their dead husbands who were in high level financial institutions that had offices in the twin towers. Implication being that they were as a group very wealthy—and greedy.   She of course stated that Trump would win in 2016.  Now as her star wanes, she jumps to another outlandish statement (outlandish not to we in the DR obviously) wrt White identity.Coulter does with her outlandish position have pretty good track record.  I don’t particularly like the woman—she’s a “coal burner”—but appreciate her progcastinations.

                        Perhaps both? Lusting for dead negros would certainly be a novel “sexual minority” to get woke-points for. Could also lead to a pretty hilarious Zombieland type movie.

            I think the reason she got away with it is because Big Media desperately wishes to quarantine white identitarian sentiments. Any prominent white making WI noises will get the Big Silence. Of course, a few whites, namely BoM, are just too big to ignore, which largely explains TDS. They can’t quarantine his views, so their only recourse is to give him the silence of the hoosegow, or perhaps the grave.

        My support for Israel started to get soft about 15 years ago. It was then I realized that the indigenous Christians of Palestine mostly support the Muslim side. Before that, we were propagandized to believe that Christianity and support for Israel were synonymous. Then when you add their liberalism and everything else they’ve supported that not only goes against what we want but is hostile to the interests of white Christians, it’s not hard to lose sympathy.Then we also have all of their fückery when it comes to money, manipulating our laws, fortifying elections, Jeffrey Epstein, weaponizing our government to do Israel’s bidding (warmongering) and every other area in life where they’ve become no better than termites eating away at our civilizational home. Also call me suspicious about all those newly minted Jewish billionaires and the idea that they made their money honestly and through superhuman intelligence. (They’re crooks just as they’ve always been.) It really is easy to get an attitude about Jews and, by extension, Israel.

            I remember watching one of Anthony Bourdain’s shows when he was in Lebanon. He spent a lot of time with a Lebanese Christian family, and they were unabashedly anti-Israel. I remember being gobsmacked about that at the time but now I understand how they felt.

        White pills for Whites abound.Years ago, Jared Taylor said that he was only hoping to keep a record to prove that not all whites were insane. We now see small glimmers of hope.A friend of mine who teaches at an elementary school in Arlington VA told me that she waits in a long line to turn into the parking lot of the school. She sits in her car and watches the hoards of Africans, Middle Easterners and Guatemalans pour into the school from buses and cars. She told me that she finds herself more irritated by the day.She said that there are 8-10 white kids in the entire large elementary school.People are noticing and these conversations are becoming more commonplace.

            Enlist her to form up a school or homeschool to teach her own kind. Take those 6-10 whites and give them a crack education in a small highly advanced setting. We invest in our own. It is time to turn the anger into constructive action.
An unrelenting stream of immigration is met with an unrelenting stream of disinvestment from them and full investment in Us.

                The “unrelenting stream of immigration” line always brings to mind the sleazy, smarmy face of Mayorkas seated next to Biden. Yet another non Cuban like the equally repulsive Mark Cuban.
I know she and her husband are strongly considering homeschooling their two kids. Coordinating a coop with the other white kids/families is a great idea.

        The descent of whites into minority status in the US – and, later, Europe – will force identity politics to the surface for whites.While whites were still the overwhelming majority, we could just ignore identity politics.But 50 years of identity politics successfully beating whites at every turn has forced whites to deal with it. For now, many white cling to the “Rufo hope” that we can force a colorblind, equality under the law society onto non-whites because, after all, it’s in the Constitution and the Constitution embodies natural rights so it has to win.Naturally (and I mean that literally), this strategy will fail. At that point, it’s either put up or shut up time for whites. Maybe we’re witnessing some whites coming around. We’ll see.

            The Rufo types are like a country that is being attacked by land but are desperately trying to pretend that they are being attacked by sea.  In this analogy, the country believes that it is immoral to defend oneself by land or to even acknowledge the attack by land at all.

                Rufo’s strategy is flawed, but at least, he recognizes that whites are being attacked, which allows whites in general to make the same recognition. Hopefully, some of those whites will see how to really fight back.

            Line:  I’m far more of a cynic than you, so I attribute Derbyshire’s acknowledgment of the JQ to the desire to avoid utter irrelevance.  He’s smart enough to see the sea change.  Sailer is more milquetoast, but even he has tepidly approached the anti-White issue.  Just as in Covid, people are being forced to take sides.  It’s not just the Levant, or sexual deviancy, or AINO foreign policy.  Glacially slowly, but surely, a few are beginning to realize that your skin color is your uniform.

                Derb is a man of his time and that can be a weakness when times are changing so fast. I don’t always agree with him but I highly admire him. I don’t think he worries at all about “irrelevance.” He’s near the end of his career and his fortunes are aligned with VDare, besieged on all sides. There’s literally no place left for him to be kicked out of. I mean, I suppose since Unz hosts his monthly diary, Unz might be willing to host Radio Derb if VDare is forced to shut down, but I don’t think Derb worries a lot about that. I think he’s at peace with his place and his beliefs. I think he says exactly what he thinks.

        The other thing is that Coulter said what everyone was thinking: No one is going to vote for a Call Center American.  The fact that she banked into a reason to cite race was a nice touch.Reminds me of a recent story where my barber got off speaker-phone tech support phone call while I was waiting and she remarked that at least she could understand the support rep to which I said “yeah it’s always easier when a White guy is on the other end of those calls” and what would have been a stop-think ten years ago was folded into the conversation as a matter-of-course remark.

            Just a little aside, one of my credit cards is with Citizens Bank. Their call center is in Puerto Rico or somewhere in Latin America. I don’t know if it’s just the rhythm or cadence of their speaking, but they are a lot easier to understand than Indians. American companies may want to consider that in the future

                I believe the Indians you refer to learned their English entirely in India.  To truly speak the language requires some time living among the native speakers.  Indians in my former department were—after a time—totally fluent in English and never had a problem communicating.

                    I once made the mistake of hiring the cheapest guide at the ruins of Tipu Sultan’s summer palace(*) in Bangalore. It *was* English, but not as we know it. Pretty sure this guy was the classic Indian BA (failed) Johnny.As with Africa, there’s a lot of shall we say Aspirational English floating about at the bottom of the Indian middle classes.The Ramaswamys or Nadellas of this world are a totally different high-functioning beast. It’s important not to conflate the two. Practically different species.*Interior walls were covered with frescoed fleur-de-lis motifs. Perfidious French sided with him on the general principle of #$%^ the British in any way possible always. Not that I’m totally averse to that sentiment these days 🙂

                    Many moons ago I was heard to say that educated Indians often had a better command of the English language, using it with more precision in speaking than indigenous Americans. I believe that was true then, for Indians raised in the British-established educational system (even for some years after independence). But they were an elite whether in India or America.To put it mildly, they were not the same type of Indians pouring into the U.S. these days. Currently even dot-Indian technologists and managerial types seem to have no interests outside of business and technology. They’re not only ignorant of Western culture but their own. As an ice-breaker and friendly gesture opening what I expected to be a long, tough negotiation, I once tried to engage an Indian car salesman in a brief chat about Patanjali’sYoga Sutras. I think he hardly even knew what I was talking about, and seemed annoyed by the irrelevance. In one way the Pajeets have assimilated all right: they know time is money.

            Evil Sandmich:  “No one is going to vote for a call center American.”  I wish you were right but you vastly underestimate White guilt and demoralization.  There are millions out there who got excited hearing a brown man say “It’s ok to be White.”  And that’s all it was, by the way – he still plans to be large and in charge.  He didn’t even marry the White trophy wife yet  (give it a few years).  Skim around the web and read just how many think he’d be a great running mate (i.e. potential next president) for Trump.Plenty of them will vote for him.  Plenty here will too – the same crowd that lionizes Thomas Sowell.

                Not nearly enough.  It reminds me of some Wang Gang guys I met in Massachusetts in 2019.  They were very well reasoned and level headed (amazingly enough) and they were also probably the only three white guys to vote for him in the primary (if they even did).

                I don’t think he can win. I don’t think he should be in contention for anything.
But let’s not forget that Diocletian was a Wog, too. He bought some time.
Sometimes you just have to make the best of the hand you’re dealt.
Funny thing is if he did become Trump’s VP, Trump would begin disparaging and belittling him from Day One (Scorpion, Frog, River). Be interesting to see how that one went. I wonder just how much iron is in Ramaswamy’s soul.

        Ron Paul was my gateway. He questioned subjects such as civil rights legislation, which made me recognize how much assumption and conditioning I brought to a subject. Through recognizing how many assumptions are made before a subject is discussed, I recognized how much any political subject is based on egregious precedent, allowing me to realize, to paraphrase Chomsky, that the best way to control the population is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinions but encourage lively debate within. Paul let me see how much I was boxed in.

        Another way to look at it Z, is that Dissidence is going mainstream. In retrospect, it could do nothing else. When I was exiled from the vault of liberal hiveminds I saw any number of writers trying to figure out what in hell had happened to us – and to them. I lurked around the Usual Suspects… The Alt Right was close to the way of things but was plagued by clowns like Spencer, Vox Day, and Milo. The NRx guys were eccentric with some rather disturbing ideas about women. The were adjacent to the Manosphere which was populated by the walking wounded of failed marriages and families and were prone to bitterness and defeatism. The common failure of all three is that they had their ideologies and you accepted them in whole, without question, or you girl fleas and had to be exiled.This is the power of Dissidence. It is only in this community I had the room necessary to change my mind. If I had a question there’s any number of guys willing to slow down, back up, and explain things to me – and do it in a way that made sense. Talking to rational adults is far different than talking to self proclaimed leaders in movements dominated by performance artists and people protecting and promoting their “brands”.

        Well, kudos to Adam’s Apple Annie for saying the unspoken part out loud. I would guess that most of us Euro-descended folks are resigned to the ubiquitous presence of less-than-Whites among us, but in our heart of hearts we’d much rather choose our elected officials from our own people. It puts me in mind of my DILs, who are die-hard lefty-Lucy’s, yet drew the line at pairing up with anything but lily-White men (although both would insist vehemently that this was mere “coincidence”.)As for Israel, I can honestly state that I never saw its significance to U.S. interests, nor had any particular animus toward its numerous enemies, at least until the camel jocks got ‘splody in my backyard a few decades ago. As a young man, all I saw was pushy ooJes lusting after mostly imaginary evidence of persecution, and unwashed sand people poking them with a stick at every opportunity. Not my circus, not my monkeys, live and let die.I find the recent kampus kerfuffles mildly amusing (from a distance) and hope that the paid players take their shenanigans to Chicago in August. Protesting for the sake of protesting seems to be a uniquely American pastime, with clueless college kids and freaks of the fringes particularly enamored of it.

        Red pilling is gradual process. Ten years ago, I first guiltily watched YouTube videos pointing out feminist hypocrisy, and thinking “hey, they are full of shit”. It was not too long after I started realizing almost everything revered by the mainstream is also bullshit. Thanks William Briggs. (And I agree with Clayton Barnett: I kindof hate old me for not figuring it out much, much sooner.)Israel has found out the hard way that when you are no longer the underdog, you are held to higher standards. They are desperately trying to maintain their victim street cred so they get licence to keep doing whatever the hell they please.

        I watched the first 15 minutes of Ramaswarmy’s podcast with Ann Coulter and it was him doing the Dinesh D’Souza civic nationalism routine and how we’re a paperwork country.This is why I said when he was still running that I would vote Democrat before voting for Ramaswarmy.  When his ethnic interests clash with the nation’s interest, he will chose his ethnic interest every single time.  It doesn’t make him a bad guy. This is just what people do.If I turn communist tomorrow, I may be a retard, but I’ll still be an American.  We’re not an idea nation.  I am not an idea.  He will never be an American no matter how long he lives here. He is and always will be an Indian.Frankly, I don’t think this was much of a white pill.  It’s just the Indian version of “I’m a Judaeo-christian” nonsense of a foreigner trying to write his way into our story and history.

Every opportunist is or will come to our shores to pluck away what we let from our grasp.If we start today and we adopt the sentiment that Coulter did, we take it back. Men doing that may make Coulter feel animal spirits toward white men again. Women hate weakness and deference and we must be honest with ourselves.Now for White men to be as bold as Coulter.

            I was nine years old when that happened and was a Navy cryptologist in the Med eleven years later. My Marine older brother is ridiculously pro-Israel and philo-semitic and tells me I should “get over” the Liberty.(I about got written up by an intelligence officer for bringing up the Liberty in an informal chat he was having with some of us sailors after he referred to Israel as our most valuable ally.  He and I were from different units and he was not in my direct chain of command.  I will never forget that conversation and I don’t think he did either–  something got back to my unit and my “military bearing” rating went down two marks.  Never made Chief on active duty)

        “For a long time, the default position for most white people was to support Israel, mostly for American reasons. Americans love the underdog and Israel seemed like the underdog. In the 1960’s and 1970’s the Israelis had to fend off the much larger neighbors, often working together. The fact that Israel somehow beat the bigger opponent tickled the American respect for the small dog that has the heart of the big dog.”“Seemed like” is correct. Because the Arab armies in those days were crud — poorly manned, poorly commanded, and poorly equipped. The Israelis and their Jewish chums in the USA ran a long-term campaign of disinformation (that continues to this day). Goes to show that a smart and organised minority always prevails against an un-organised majority.As for Coulter, I wonder if she’d have had the courage to say something similar to, say Joe Lieberman? That she didn’t want to be governed by a Jew? Or, say, to Obama? That she didn’t want to be governed by a negro? Indians are easy targets — bowing and scraping all time, obsequious and anxious to please. She could have literally kicked him in the balls and he wouldn’t have reacted.

                    Ann’s very intelligent but she’s no leader, IMO. I realize she’s not running for office and has been successful in selling lots of books. . . BUT after a while her schtick has run out of shteam;-) Also, her fashion sense is very 90s, with the long streaked hair and the anorexic body. Time to freshen up her look, don’t cha think?

                            I’ve never had the hots for Ann, but consider her reasonably attractive — especially these days when so many women (including women in her age range) tattoo large portions of their skin. Even if she were drop-dead ravishing, though, so what? Media face workers have to be on the better-looking part of the bell curve. It’s an unspoken part of their job descriptions. “Unfair,” maybe, but human nature will have its way until AI robots take over, and even they will probably be programmed to respond to designed beauty or handsomeness.

                    I’m familiar with “Experience is a hard teacher. Test first, lesson afterwards.” From, of all things, a book about computer software. I don’t recall ever encountering it elsewhere.
Of course the same concept appears in many forms: school of hard knocks, etc. What seems notable is that such pearls of wisdom seem to have all but vanished in the [post-] modern world, where apparently we can bring anything we can conceive into reality merely by wishing it so. And Reality had damned well better deliver, or else.

                    That’s the right tempo, Tempo. Why would a White guy in his right mind vote for a non-white guy knowing that most members of Sailor’s coalition of the fringes, blacks, Jews especially, vote for the anti-white Progressive? “Hey Whitey, yeah you. You vote for hope &amp; change &amp; Obama. How did that work out for ya?”

                The problem with her is that I don’t know whether to take her seriously or not. I don’t know if she has had an epiphany or just playing a role for TV. Someone who has dated an Indian, a Jew and a Negro (I’ve never done those things and I don’t feel lesser for it) leaves me skeptical that she has any clarity of thought or any actual devotion to the ideas that come out of her mouth.

                This is related to something that I’ve seen before. Whites – even liberal Good Whites – don’t like to be lectured about racism by Indians or Asians.
I’ve seen it firsthand. When some fat black lady or white-looking Jew rails about white racism, whites mostly nod along or, at least, keep from looking like someone just farted next to them. But when an Asian or an Indian try to pull the same schtick, the whites look very uncomfortable.

                    I think that’s because, regardless of what you think about the black man, and I think nothing but negative things about him I assure you, when he starts his we wuz slaves schtick and points out that “I didn’t want to be here, I was forced to be here” to you there is a point there. Not a good point, mind you, slavery 200 years ago doesn’t excuse anybody’s behavior now, but you can at least see where he’s coming from: His people were, as a matter of pure fact, forced to come here, and expatriating themselves has been and still is an excruciatingly difficult and expensive process. Obviously most people on our side of things react to that with “deal with it, life’s hard” but you do at least see his point for being mad at whitey when maybe at some point in the distant past whitey equalled massa in his ancestral memory.I mean, the jew thing is just nonstop holocaust propaganda at work, we all know what’s up with that.But for an asian or ESPECIALLY an indian, there is ZERO reason for them nor their people to be in the west except for purely mercenary profit seeking reasons. None of their countries are at war nor even particularly violent places, none of them were slaves, none of them have even been treated especially cruelly/badly by the white man throughout history (arguably in india’s case the best they’d ever had it was when the white man was in charge of them).Hearing bitching and moaning about the evils of the white man when you are 1000 percent around him voluntarily is hard to take even for shitlibs.

            Easier for Coulter to say that about Indians than blacks or J’s, sure, but I wouldn’t say Indians are easy targets since no other mainstream figure has said anything like that that I’m aware of in recent years. Perhaps this is a Gateway Statement, leading to more White ethnocentrism…

        “It is one of those crystalizing moments for the suburban peasant when he realizes that lots of other people are thinking the same thing and that it is okay to think such things.”
Somewhat reminiscent of that moment when Ceasescu got booed at his speech in December, 1989. He and his wife didn’t last long after that. It hasn’t gotten quite that far along yet but it’s on the same lines.

            This is a great observation.  I’ve described Jan 6th this way.  A shit ton of people showed up in DC to reject the fake election and boo the people responsible for allowing it.
These are people who get their boots licked by obsequious groupies every day.  Getting screamed at instead of cheered was a terrifying dose of reality.
Everything since then has proven that there definitely was not an insurrection that day…

        I’ve experienced two big eye-openers over the past 4 years. One is the utter craven avariciousness of the medical establishment. The other is the utter obsession the political class (both democrats and republicans) have with foreign interventionism. In deed, if the 2020 election was stolen (I’m not sure it was), I do not think it was the Democrats alone that stole it. Rather, I think is was a combination of both Democrats and Republicans at the behest of the neo-cons that stole it. It was very clear during 2020 that the GOP establishment hated Trump specifically because Trump wanted to “down size” the American empire. They weren’t about to allow this to happen.Do keep in mind that the proxy war with Russia is exactly what Hillary promised to do in August-September of 2016 if she were elected. She said they wanted to bring both Ukraine and Georgia into NATO and wanted to impose a “no fly” zone over both Iraq and Syria to the Russians.

                This election stolen or not stolen is a rabbit hole. Even I don’t jump into it via “Normie” discussion. What the meta question is, “What are the deficiencies in the current process that may allow fraud, how can we fix them, and why do we not?” These questions are better received and harder to counter.If you charge fraud, you are immediately told to “prove it”. Then the rules of evidence—in our State courts—is set that you not only have to prove/show fraudulent ballots, but also that this number of ballots would have changed the election results! That standard of evidence is nearly impossible, especially with current election rules.  This indicates that the Courts are not really interested in getting involved in the political process, while pretending to be the final overseer of credibility/legitimacy of the election results.This is why I’ve simply stopped participating in the ruse of democratic process.

                    The process by which the 2020 election was stolen is so simple that I am convinced that the GOP rolled out morons and losers talking about “the kraken” and what not to distract from the simplicity of it. The process is so simple that Molly Ball wrote an article bragging about it in TIME magazine a few months later. That article is absolutely a starting point to send to anyone who says “where’s the proof” because it is so blatant.But once you get past that article, which discusses the setup for the fraud,  and how it is possible, the execution is super simple. They kept the running count of the ballots all day. Late at night, when most people were in bed, they shut down the count in a handful of blue cities in swing states they controlled – Philly, Atlanta, Milwaukee, etc. Then they kicked out the observers and taped up the windows and brought in trucks full of mail-in ballots with the exact amount they needed to make up the gap in that state.That’s it. It’s that simple. No kraken, no super secret reptile hackers manipulating the vote count on a computer, it’s just printing mail-in ballots and delivering them at a time when they made sure nobody was watching. It even leaves a paper trail.

                                The AZ call, followed by the vote counting pauses in the remaining states just as Trump was about to run the table, we the tell.  It wasn’t just that the mail in ballot plan was executed…but that a LOT of people were in on it.

                    My standard thing to say is that alleging fraud is more a moral judgment than a legal one. It’s not that I can prove you did, I just know that you would.
When you declare your opposition to be Hitler, then you have a moral obligation to commit fraud to defeat him. It’s either that or you’re someone who tells lies about your opponent, which also brings fraud into question.

        Call me naive, but I have always perceived myself as being on the radical fringe of the dissident movement given my focus on solution versus analysis; which is verboten speech even here. Boy-o-boy was I wrong about that. I stumbled upon a new podcast genre while on a long ride the other day. It was based out of Arizona (home to a lot of military retirees) and I was shocked to find that my “mild” invective to action was downright tame compared to some of the “talk” coming out of the hinterlands. There are indeed many of us who correctly anticipate that the “wheels are likely to come off” sooner rather than later, and its gonna get real as opposed to the bull session style confabulations of the present lull. For those who haven’t already seen this, it’s maximum red pill.https://9gag.com/gag/a1mAyov

        Serendipity… just before hopping over here for the daily Z commentary, I had a bit of an epiphany after watching a YT clip of Senator Kennedy being interviewed by the black lady at FOX, something Faulkner. The topic at hand was the mayhem on various American campuses. I watched because I kind of like Kennedy. Or did like him. Turns out he allies himself with the rest of the Israel-first tools in the GOP. Quoth the Senator: “The President of the United States, for a change, needs to do what is moral and right, and in his heart he knows: We need to stand with Israel and the Jewish people. We need to fight with everything we have against Hamas and Iran; we need to do to Hamas what we did to ISIS and al-Qaeda.”“Moral and right”… see what Z man has been preaching? No rational argument there, just the moral exhortation, even from Senator Kennedy, that corn-pone plain talker from Louisiana.No, Senator. How about “We need to stand with America and its people. We need to fight with everything we have against the well-financed and organized nihilist movement in our country that latches itself to every passing fad, with the sole purpose of disrupting and destroying our civil society. The Israel question is entirely independent and secondary to this crisis.”If Kennedy can’t say this, no one can. I thought of him as one of the “last of the Romans”, but nope. It’s all very tiresome and yes, my mind has definitely changed. I am on board with ‘Zero GOP’!

            Very disappointing of Senator Kennedy but not unexpected. He’d like some ‘side’ to not be blood-thirsty maniacs who have some kindof sexual desert-tribal hang-ups that makes them act out in strange ways, but unfortunately that does not exist in this conflict, if anywhere.

        “When was the last time you changed your mind on something”Ironically, the answer for me is my outlook on “our greatest ally.” I was fervently in the pro-Israel Republican boat a few years ago. My eyes were opened by numerous events, reading different historical facts, and listening to different well spoken content creators. I’m not an Israel hater, but I’ve come to realize there are no “good guys” in the Middle East, and that I have no interest in supporting any faction there. Both sides would like to ethnically cleanse the other. Peace comes when the US stops being the only one vetoing two state solutions in the UN, and being the bitch of Israeli interests and UN peace keeping troops separate the two sides.

            My epiphany came when I learned that the Christians over there mostly support the Muslim side (and those Christians are majority or plurality Orthodox). It didn’t happen instantly, but I started connecting the dots in my head. I started understanding why Russia was friendly with the Palestinians, part of the reason being that they were the protectors of Orthodox Christians under the Ottoman Empire.I don’t hate Israel or the Jews (though it is fun to rant about them on the internet), but they have gotten too big for their britches, control too much of what our government and economy does. We need our own Putin to put them in their place, starting with taking away their ill-gotten wealth.

        The wakeup call for me was the anti-white stuff going mainstream with Obama. I thought his election would be an olive branch, but it was weakness. Started looking, found an online right ecosystem. Started listening to Alex Jones, who was edgy libertarian at the time, I’d say.
Whatever you say about the guy, he has a lot of different voices on. Definitely broadened my horizons. (Led me to Vox Day, who led me here btw.)
And then there was 8chan, which was a ton of fun back then. Dare to be evil, and all of that.

            At the election of Obama a silent (to us) switch was flipped. A bunch of my old friends, most prominently Steve Albini who just died suddenly, went from “edgy libertarian” to (now we might say) “woke left” over the course of, it felt like, a few days. Since he knew more famous people than I did, I wondered if he was given some kind of heads-up. It wasn’t only him, and the change seemed to proceed hierarchically: celebrities first, media figures second, etc. Every “old internet” guy could make a list of strange changes and disappearances.Down on the never-in-on-any-conspiracies level, we divided into people making excuses (he’s married! he has a daughter! he’s old!)—i.e., people to soon “go woke” in the “Who goes Nazi?” sense—and people walking away, looking suspiciously over our shoulders.I’ve never heard a plausible story. Something happened. And it wasn’t “emergent.”

        Z-Man, you are just wrong on this one. You are missing the already born Global Identity, Global Politics, and Global Morality. If you look CLOSELY at the videos of the various protests, you will see I am correct on this.Globalization is more than just cheap stuff sold by China and manufactured by slave Uighur labor. Its a Global Identity, Tribes, and Morality. And that morality is that huWhite people are genetically evil, all Yachtzees, and deserve anything and everything that non Whites do to them.This is why on 9/11 pretty much all the non-White world celebrated, and on 10/7 the same happened. BLM in Chicago put out a celebratory tweet in support on that day. You might ask yourself what the concerns of black people in Chicago have do with what happened in Southern Israel that day, but the collapse of nations into Globalism does not just stop at trade but in politics and morality as well. The black people of BLM saw 10/7 as a great victory over YT.The protests and counter protests (save UCLA) are all of a pattern. Various protestors: Muslimas (no Rage Boys show up for some reason), blacks, ugly fat White lesbians, the various paid anti-fa heroin addicts /goons, and aging hippies. That is who is at the protests. The counter-protesters are frat boys, nearly all White, who have had enough. The Protesters generally burn the US flag, raise the Palestinian one, call for a global intifada, and chant Death to America, Death to Israel. The frat boys try and rescue the US flag, and sing the national anthem. This is pretty much anti-White vs. White. Israel is just the accidental turf being fought over. It could have been something else.America is dead. That nation is not coming back. But the memories of what was are strong, and can be seen in any old TV show and movie up through the late 1980s. It creates emotions and the anti-morality of the Globalist anti-White morality. When America ceased to exist, the politics, place, and path for non-Whites was obvious and strong. For Whites it has taken a while, but anti-anti-White seems to be it, with “racist” symbols like the American Flag, national anthem, and anything and everything the fat ugly Muslimas (as repulsive to young White guys as Lizzo) want is the emerging White guy morality and politics.Bonus add: Biden under orders from Obama has now withheld “offensive” weapons to Israel unless it agrees to Hamas’s terms. Inevitably he will have to order an invasion of Israel to “save Gaza” in months if not weeks. That is the power of the Global Morality and Politics of his coalition which has decided that certain people are no longer needed or welcome. Trump has sided with Israel. Its a meeting engagement between anti-White and White forces.[I don’t know why Rage Boys are not showing up at these protests. Its weird. But significant I think.]

        Have you paid attention to the unproportional amount of young white women demonstrating for Hamas in the colleges around the US?Do you know that women instincts lead them toward the winning side’s males  in every war? Doing so women protect their future offspring.It’s what happened to the French women in WWII, including Coco Channel, who lived with the German officer throughout the war. If it were not for the Russia and allies, the French women’s instincts would be just right.Are these wrapped in keffiye young American girls’ instincts right too? Hmmm.

            That’s exactly what they’re doing – except that they’re too young to realize that they’re not joining the strongest tribe. They think that they’re joining the strongest tribe because everyone for their entire lives have told them that the anti-white, sorry anti-oppressor, crowd is on top.
But, of course, the real tribe in charge is proving it by smashing the protests and getting Congress to pass all kinds of laws to protect them.

            What’s the backup plan for the day when the absence of melech ha moshiach can no longer be explained away?
Let’s review some reasons for the frustrating guaranteed failure:
• shamayim is rakia by another name,• rakia is imaginary,• mhm is to be annointed melech on the alleged authority of shamayim, but• no shamayim, no mhm.
The conclusion is easy peasy. It’s been obvious for centuries.
So, back to the doctrine of the am being their own moshaich? How will that work out after the self-chosen am have stirred up the other nations against the self-chosen?

        The “left” denounced and culturally exiled Coulter as an irredeemable racist long ago. I think fox news stopped putting her on several years ago (though I wouldn’t know for sure since I don’t watch). And she said what she said to Ramaswamy, who the “left” classifies with Clarence Thomas and Bill Cosby. So as far as the blob is concerned, this was just a conversation between non-persons taking place in the outer darkness. I question Zman’s assertion that “millions of normies” have any awareness of what was said on Ramaswamy’s podcast, or that he even has a podcast.I really, really wanted her to be Trump’s press secretary

        Things are changing in Canada, for sure. The flood of 1.5 million lower class Indians, Sikhs, and Pakistanis per year since COVID seems to have finally made some people notice.I’m not just talking about online. White people *in real life* are talking about demographic concerns, in particular when it comes to hiring and jobs. The housing market. Crime. People just know now, once you see it you can’t unsee it. And the non-whites can sense it.These conversations would have been unthinkable among normal people even 5 years ago. Especially among people who are upper middle class. But they’re happening. It’s almost shocking to hear what people are saying. Not all, but many people are .. different .. now.

            It’s a terrible thing what they have inflicted on Canadians. Trudeau is the Democratic Party of the USA’s crown/clown Prince. And it’s disgusting. And that horrid troll lady who wants to steal your bank account? Is this really how Canadians are, and we just didn’t know until now? I had the Canadian persona/image all wrong, but then America has “Joe Biden” now. Does Canada have a Trump or MCGA movement?

                I think Trudeau was recently awarded the dubious title of most-hated Prime Minister in Canadian history, and it seems like his government may not last too long in any case. If he goes, he’s likely to be replaced by federal Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who, if not necessarily Trumpian, has at least been accused of keeping company with the likes of Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson.

        What I want for Israel/Palestine is for both populations to stay where they are and not immigrate to historically white nations.  Then, I want one single state, reparations and affirmative action for Palestinians, anti-racism training for Israeli Jews, and a strong refugee resettlement program to take in Afghanis, Syrians, etc.  This would ideally prevent Jews from having a home base from which to launch their subversions of and attacks on other nations.

        So, are DR opinion leaders actually influencing opinion or are they enunciating views that have already become prevalent? Does a Coulter catapult ambivalence about white identity into affirmation or is she merely giving voice to inchoate opinion? And if the latter, what is it then that has pushed large numbers of whites, often against their will, into white identitarianism?As to Israel, I neither oppose nor support it. To me, it’s just another country and unless it intentionally harms me or my people, I couldn’t care less about it. That said, AINO’s slavishness toward Israel is pathetic. But then again, AINO is not my country anyway; it’s merely where I live.

        I think what Coulter said was true and right, but she just said it to a swarthy pajeet.  Now, if she said to, say, Tim Scott that America is a White country and she doesn’t want be ruled by blacks, then we’d really be getting somewhere.

        The last dramatic one for me was the Syrian civil war, per your opener. Always aware of paleocon thing but was formerly a pious WSJ/Weekly Standard type of crusader idiot, even defending the 43rd stooge’s good intentions occasionally. FWIW, already thought of myself as a race realist back then, so anyway, ideology is a helluva drug.With the disillusioned fallout from the coof I often said, it reminded me of me circa 2010 with wars.In retrospect the overall useless jerk Obama was preferable on balance since he was, apparently, only persyn in the building not sexually excited over nuking Moscow.As described well in the post some Weltanschauung shift probably hasn’t registered fully, for example, being somehow vaguely “environmentalist” now– not surgically transitioned to peaced-out granola guru from Ayn Rand-thumping dork, but definitely off the wagon.

        😂😂😂Like I said… Trump opened the door, Coulter stepped right through it. God I love being right!Would Coulter have said what she did when she said it if Trump hadn’t handed her a fastball over the plate? She has balls of steel, but probably not.She has skirted around on the edges for years on the white hate issue. But point blank in the presence of Ramaswamy?I don’t think so.Trump is now Coulters’s enemy.The enemy of her enemy is now her ally Trump!You see how that works boys and girls? You can like the message and hate the messenger.What has been made clear after Israel has whipped the victim card out so often that’s it’s a tattered, worn out piece of kindling is they can no longer play the card. They are now the bulldog tossing the poodle around by the neck.Between the anti white issue now wide open, and the Israeli narrative collapsing. Things are looking up…

        I’ve changed my mind a lot over the last 4 years. For one, I now realize how avaricious the medical establishment is. It is way beyond anything I thought 5-10 years ago. I’ve also decided that our political class are no longer the “good guys” and now agree with that poll in Germany about 15-20 years ago when they said they considered America, meaning our political class, to be the greatest threat to world peace.I have also decided that the Islamic jihadi threat was bogus and never really existed. The tell tale signs? That the Bush administration never did anything to stop the immigration of Muslims into the U.S. Another is that, unlike that French novel “Submission” that features an Islamic party in France, Muslim immigrants have never formed their own political parties in Europe. They just vote for whatever leftist/socialist party offers them the most free shit (as Aaron Clary puts it). Additionally, unlike that obnoxious Christian right video from about 20 years ago that talked about the 8.1 fertility rate of Muslims, the Muslim immigrants in Europe now have fertility rates the same as the white Europeans. Most Middle-east Muslim countries have below replacement birth rates as well. There are many threats to our liberty out there. But the Muslims are no longer one of them,On the other hand, I’m still a hard core Ayn Rand libertarian and will always be. Some things will never change.

        Z Man observes that, “Americans love the underdog,” which seems to be true.
But Bin Laden said, “When people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature they will like the strong horse,” which also seems true.
Don’t these statements contradict each other? If they do, can they both still be true?
Or is there a racial dimension?  Is the urge to root for the underdog a feeling that is mostly found in whites only?

        There are apparently two bills in the House re Palestinian protests on campuses. One would send US Citizens to Gaza for protesting; the other foreign visa holders.
They are both by Red State Republicans. Neither will go forward but its somewhat brilliant to strip away from the Coalition of the Ascendant, the group with money and organizational know-how.
We lose again and again because our enemies have more money, and more organization. Strip both away and things change, like Carthage without a dominant navy any more (how Rome actually defeated Hannibal).

                It won’t pass, but it certainly will generate discord. There are the “fancy” groups like Soros, Larry Fink, etc. who are bankrolling this along with Qatar and Iran and State/CIA.And against this is the non-fancy “dirt people” group like Bill Ackman, Daniel Loeb, etc. They are rich beyond anyone’s dream but they are not “fancy” like the uber-connected Fink or Soros. They don’t get invited to Obama’s birthday parties. They don’t hang out with Drake. And make no mistake the protests are directly aimed by the fancies at the non-fancies. Its not about White guys though the frats are getting involved because they are “allowed” to yell at the Muslimas. [The left sees the danger in this for them of course — allow one thing you allow more things soon.]The non-fancies have pretty much had it with Dems. While the fancies are even more lashed to them. Its like us with Bill Gates being fancy and we are not.UCLA of course was different. Supposedly the entire (((frat))) societies of SoCal got together and fought with the protesters for hours before cops were finally called in, after a (((girl))) was assaulted and knocked unconscious with a skull fracture.

        When I heard my first Power Hour on the topic I realized I’d been thinking in a similar fashion but knew voicing it would result in cancellation. Now 5 years later I don’t care who hears it. And when I mention it to some of my suburban neighbors no one seems shocked and more often than not I’m surprised to here I’m agreed with.

        When Israel went total meltdown freakout and helicopter gunship’ed their own people, and then pretended they didn’t overreact and freak out, well…there are questions. And then you saw them making modest women strip, ok, they may have a bomb, we can maybe give leeway to that idea, but then they paraded around in the women’s undergarments, and arrested chubby millenials and kicked them in the balls, and stripped them down…and just yeah no. You’re not the enlightened ones. It’s an insult for them to want us to pretend they are!

        Israel is the defacto 51st state – with Ukraine a close 52nd. I support Israel but let them fight their wars with their own weapons &amp; their own money. The same goes for Ukraine. Tired of this ever-flowing conveyor belt of guns &amp; cash going east. Ukraine- IMHO – is a massive money-laundering scam anyway; probably plenty of grift with Israel too.

            I support Israel……which means that you are a friend of a mortal enemy ofallother nations on Earth. The enemy, however is divided by incoherent ideas, which will be his undoing. He is doomed. Still, it won’t hurt us to learn with which faction of the enemy you are supporting like a good little collaborator.So, do you stand with secularist David Ben-Gurion, his “federated union of all continents”, and “theSupreme Court of Mankind“? Or do you stand with the master theocrats andtheir ancient fantasyof grabbing the whole Earth, enslaving the nations, and shattering the nations? Or are you with some vague, unidentified faction pretending to be like neither Gurion nor the theocrats?Whom do you support and serve?

        You aren’t “white”; you’re Slavic, and maybe something else in addition to that, too. I’m Norman, Saxon, Irish, Celtic, Caucasian.“white” is preposterously shallow. A pale Korean, too, can claim to be “white”, and there are millions of eastern Asians who are as pale, or paler, than millions of our diverse peoples. We aren’t “white”.We are the diversity of humanity, or most of it, anyway. We are why the world knows calculus, chemistry, celestial mechanics, and electromagnetism (all of which we ought to reclaim jurisdiction over).
