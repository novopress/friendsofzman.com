        If Bloomberg is so ‚Äúconservative‚Äù, than why is he just as eager to get guns out of the hands of the white people who don‚Äôt commit crimes? ‚ÄúElitist‚Äù and ‚ÄúStatist‚Äù would be much better words to describe him, frankly.

            Society will always create detached elites. People will always organise in a pyramid.

                Yeah, well pardon me if I‚Äôm sick to death of fucks like Bloomer somehow being ordained by god to live at the top of the pyramid.Fuck him and his nanny state bullshit.  I‚Äôd rather keep my guns and my 24oz sodas and take my chances with the gangbangers than deal with an army of Bloomberg enabled state tormentors.I don‚Äôt care if my life is shorter and more violent that way (it won‚Äôt be, but just for argument‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs assume it will).  I‚Äôd rather live however long it is on my terms than live slightly longer in the form of an eternal child.Many of us are grown-ass men, and would like to live our lives like that actually means something.

                        Heh. I finally gave it up because I wanted to try enjoying life for a change. My experience is that, in the main, lawyers are miserable people who make trouble where there isn‚Äôt any.

                                I had a Lawyer in the 1980s who did a fantastic job for me and who got to know me and I him. It was a one up and our paths have not crossed since. At one dinner we had together he confided to me: Lawyers just don‚Äôt understand the fact that EVERYONE, yes EVERYONE, just hates us. I agreed.
