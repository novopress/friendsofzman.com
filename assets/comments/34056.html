        Did my own real-life experiment.  Lived for 30 years in NYC metro area…last 10 was hanging on by fingernails.  Even the simplest tasks like a routine trip to the DMV were immersions in utter chaos.  The horror stories about the impact of open borders are not exaggerated, if anything understated.  Moved 40 days ago to a rural county. 92.8% “non-vibrant” (I checked).  The improvement in everyday quality of life is off measurement scales. Nothing is locked up. Counter help is competent. The DMV guy apologized b/c I had to wait for two people before me for a license. Nobody drives like an a-hole. People are polite…almost to a fault.  We have a small cohort of the nutters that come with the two colleges in town–but everyone laughs at them. Reminds me of where my parents grew up, just with mountains.

            Same experience here.  Unfortunately we didn’t get out sooner, but on plus side, my children have grown up with no delusions about race.

                I had a similar experience moving to exurban Florida from Southern California in 2022. People are polite. Public services are good: roads are well maintained, county officials are helpful. Bums are chased off public spaces; county sheriffs will remove them.
Like night and day.

                    I consider myself fortunate to have lived in such a place my entire life. I grew up in a rural town that was literally 100% white. I think I met (briefly) ONE Negro before going to college, where I met… two. There was ONE in my grad school program (he didn’t graduate).For the past 30 years I have lived a couple of towns over. In my present community there are a handful of Negroes, no Jews, no gays, no Mexicans, no Indians (of either kind) and one family of Asians that runs the Chinese restaurant. There is no crime, no graffiti, no blight, no vandalism, and no drive-bys. Plenty of shooting, though — at the local gun clubs.If you’re a deer you had better watch your tail.I have never been victimized by a Negro in my life. It’s nothing personal. Ever since I was a kid all I had to do was read the newspaper, watch the six o’clock news and readNational Geographicto know what the score was with the colored race. Social statistics in college confirmed what I already knew.Still, most people around here would not openly admit to being racist. The anti-racism stuff is basically a religious piety imposed by the elites. “Good” people are not racist, and no one wants to be seen as “bad.” Like transubstantiation, they believe utter nonsense to appear to be good.People who do know the score, like cops and corrections officers, understand that their paycheck depends on keeping their mouths shut about who is responsible for the most mayhem and dysfunction in society.

            My parents decades ago (1970s) retired to a[Spittoon sound effect]rural part of the state that sometimes had the distinction of being the state’s poorest county. The county DMV was tiny enough that it leased part of [redacted]’s Cabinet Shop. When my mother was widowed a ladder was stolen from her shed when she was away. She complained to neighbors and the ladder magically reappeared.

        That White mother who called a bulbhead bantu iglet by its historical North American name is up to 250k in donations on GiveSendGo now.I don’t want to read too much into it but this is certainly a surprising turn of events. I don’t think this would’ve happened if that bantu didn’t get a $500k reward for murdering a White kid. That whole thing, the ooga booga press conference, them buying a house &amp; a Cadillac with the donations &amp; the black judge teeing up the murderer’s inevitable slap on the wrist was peak optics for racial division.I hope she gets a million bucks.

            It really does seem like the non-boomer white population has reached a tipping point with being forced to tolerate the burning,  looting, and murdering.
The amazing thing with this story is the flow rate of the money, a quarter million in 24 hours for just saying “fuck off” to some alien trying to outrage pimp is pretty amazing. I hope she gets a million too, so the mainstream news will signal boost it expecting the same old boomercuck reaction.

                        You spent your careers enforcing those laws. What are you talking about? There was never any pushback on any of it until the past decade and the Boomers chased every anti-immigrationist politician out of public life and the workplace.
You personally may not have. But Boomers ran American workplaces for 25+ years and its current composition owes a great deal to them. You left behind weapons for future generations to use on the white population and now the rest of us have to deal with it while you enjoy retirement.

                            I think I was pretty clear.  We didn’t get the ball rolling.  To say we needed to roll back the laws is nonsense.  You might as well then blame the cohort of 150 years ago for failure to repatriate freed slaves back to Africa.  You could also use your logic to blame much of the present problem on generation X’ers or Millenials.
The blame game is for “losers”. You want to live in the past, fine.  You want to find fault, then look in the mirror and move on.

                                I will take another swipe at the generational thing too.There are a few core issues that are completely ignored under all the emotions and defensive posturing.Helicopter parents raise their children into a de facto social contract where the parent swoops in and solves things or otherwise guides and safeguards the child in almost everything. When a helicoptered Millennial or Gen Z realizes the life they were promised was a lie, they look to their helicopter parents as responsible, and more broadly, that whole Boomer cohort of elder generations. They are right to, because even more than the social contract their parents raised them into, those kids were not given the life skills to do otherwise. When the elder generations decide that fixing the issues is not their problem, those children are correct to feel betrayed and all the emotions associated with that betrayal.NAXALT being pointless, the broad trend of helicopter parenting coinciding with a national loss of prosperity, all encompassing, means that betrayal has infected the young as a collective who then vent it against the old as a collective. The older collective being the Boomer generation and older, because Millennials, which quietly captures all the damage that the Silent generation still perpetrates. From the perspective of the young, the Boomers are the problem because the Boomers raised their children to believe and act as if the Boomers are responsible, and then the Boomers betrayed the contract by washing their hands of it when it becomes inconvenient to the lives of the Boomers.The fact that the younger collective needs to take responsibility for their lives regardless of how poorly they were raised is immaterial to the betrayal. The fact that the Boomer collective refuses to accept responsibility for their part of it, whether as parents or voters or citizens with the bulk of the generational wealth, inflames the betrayal into Boomer hate and Boomer bashing, because that is how human psychology works.Part of the refusal of older generations to take responsibility is because they cannot let go of their self image as being morally righteous Progressives creating the City on the Hill. To admit they failed and betrayed the young would be to accept that they are feckless rather than righteous, which, to be fair, is an act of humility most humans refuse. A further difficulty is that Boomers are the most manipulated generation because they were the most propagandized generation in effect. Radio and TV are new, powerful technologies, and humanity had no psychological defenses when those technologies were handed over to psychopaths. Would the voice in your living room lie to you? Constantly? Via some of the best con men humanity has ever produced? Yes, constantly, as it turns out. Psychopaths are like that. The internet managed to become a counterbalance and increased the pace that people adapted to the liar in their living room, but the Boomers were conned, and conned hard. Admitting that is another act of humility people struggle with.So not only do the younger generations have to mourn the loss of the lives they were promised and their betrayal by their parents, the older generations have to perform a heroic act of humility and discard the glittering image of self-righteousness they were raised into. If both sides managed those feats, then the Boomer hate would dissipate. Especially if the Boomers suddenly discovered the wisdom to channel the betrayal of the young against the American ruling class where it largely belongs.It has been said that democracy only lasts until the voters figure out they can vote themselves all the spoils of the treasury. That line should have been taken a step further by noting that democracy also dies the moment that oligarchs figure out they can buy politicians who will then vote all the spoils of the treasury over to the oligarchs. Which lets the oligarchs buy more politicians, rinse, repeat until “Our Democracy” is a thin skinsuit for an oligarchy. “Our Democracy” collapsing down to the ruling class creates a strange truth in how that statement gets used in America, and “Our Democracy” is a broader betrayal of the young by the old. Oh, and it appears that the Zionist lobby pioneered and perfected the oligarch takeover of democracy as far as modern day Britain and America are concerned.So rather than being pointless, anger against Boomers is part of the process of the young grieving the loss of the lives they were promised, the nation they were told they would inherit, and in many cases, the betrayal of the social contract their parents handed them. Anger being a stage of grief and all that. More the shame that Boomers are proud, graceless fools about it.

                            “You spent your careers enforcing those laws.”
Absurd. Most had absolutely nothing to do with enforcement. Mostly, whites did what whites do — their jobs. What the company is paying them to do. Y’know, the whole thing about being a man of your word. Something else that will apparently die out with the Booms.

                    Why do boomers have such a hard time being criticized as a group?  They can lay into millennials all day and I wouldn’t get bent out of shape over it, if anything I would probably agree.  But mention their generation in a negative light, and they act as though they’ve been personally insulted, if not worse.   Can anyone explain why they’re so thin skinned about this?  It’s almost like some expect to be worshiped because they were born at the right time to take advantage of the post-WWII order.  Is it just an ego thing?

                        Because it’s an entire generation of women who view responsibility as anathema. Just look at the responses, “Muh Hart-Cellar, muh Civil Rights Act”. Never mind how we’ve been in charge for almost 2 generations and things have only accelerated, look at the Silents.
Notice how things have only started to change as the Boomers go to the great MLK shrine in the sky, luckily the zoomers are actually pretty pro-white.

                        There was a meme the “Night of the Pillow” that was going around a few years ago. What we fear is that the generations coming into political power are going to apply that meme as a real solution to the last of my generation — the Boomers — as we fade from the scene and white group consciousness finally sweeps to the fore, if it ever does. I do think it will eventually but that’s a subject for another discussion.From a personal angle I don’t care if you apply that solution indiscriminately to us because I recognize that I’m going to die at some point anyway. From another angle I do care because I think it would be unjust and a very poor precedent.But most Boomers don’t feel the way I do. It’s quite true that we have been the most selfish generation of all time, not for anything we did united politically pursuing group interests (that could be argued) but just because of a unique historical accident. We enjoyed undeserved the best that life had to offer in an America that has vanished. We fear that the envy that will burst forth from that fact will be the final nail. Haha. As I said, I personally don’t care.I also think it’s an irrational fear. You will probably just forget about us the same way as we have forgotten about all previous generations that passed away without any special label attached to them (again, another discussion.)Just my two cents.

                            If you walk along the street, find, and pick up a $20 bill that a poor person lost through a hole in his pocket—are you a thief, and/or a person of some moral deficiency?  Should you be expected to walk to the nearest church and deposit such largess into the “poor box”.  Should you give this $20 to the next bum begging on the sidewalk?
The above is fairly analogous to the knock on the Boomer generation.

                        It’s because the criticism is too broad a brush and does nothing to change the situation as it now presents itself.  It is focused upon one generation when the problem arguably spanned several generations. It is simply “feel good” pablum for the non-thinker.  It is illogical in the same sense as an “ad hominem” attack and just as fruitless.

It does one thing. It identifies one potential threat in our midst: Boomers. No one over 70 is trustworthy, no matter what their bona fides, because they are temperamentally and culturally unable to do what is  necessary. You didn’t do it yet, you will not do it now, so please, get out of the way. Let’s not pretend you’re going to do something about all thisnow. Please.

                                “Let’s not pretend you’re going to do something about all thisnow.”Big talk.  No one in the commentary to my reading has said we (Boomers) were doing anything.  And you, your generation is now doing what?  I thought so.My suspicion is that you are doing little more than any particular “Boomer” you decry, but worse—blaming your inaction, or inability to effect change, on the Boomer generation.  Again, loser talk, so I reject such.I/we won’t be around in another decade.  Who will you blame then?  Again, not yourself, I suspect.  You and others like you, always need a “fall guy” to blame for your misfortunes and inadequacies.  I’ve seen it many times.Something like AA’s 12-step program is needed for you guys.  You really need to stop blaming others for your own problems/situations and accept responsibility and move on.

                        Because I’m not a God Damned Collectivist. Is that too hard for you to understand? Do I have to use single syllable words?
This all just smacks of August Comte, probably the biggest influence in twisting the Enlightenment into what it became. The guy who invented sociology, and taught his followers to think of humanity as a singular entity.

Right, you’re something far worse, you’re an individualist.  Amazing how well that jewish libertarian ideology worked on you.  I’m sure you got yours and to hell with everyone else, right?  “I don’t care, I’ll be dead”

                                Of course I’m an individualist. Collectivism is the root cause of pretty much all our problems. All this equality bullshit, collectivism. Altruism, collectivism. Civil rights, collectivism. New age spirituality, Mother Gaia, collectivism.
Collectivism is hogwash. There is no such thing as a forest. There are only trees. A forest is nothing more than an abstraction in the mind. An idea. The same abstraction applied to people and societies, an ideology.

Steve’s thinking has more philosophical basis/understanding than any of yours—especially wrt to logic where you repeatedly use “ad hominem” (inherently fallacious) and “gratuitous assertions” in argument.
Might want to review your philosophical background (intro logic) yourself.  You seem to have forgotten some of the basics.

The apologetics for these subversives who come out of the woodwork to lecture White people about how they’re actually therealvillains for viewing this along racial lines needs to come to an end.In addition to being peak optics for racial divisions its also been peak optics for White cucks. The nogs &amp; their cuck allies, especially the father of the murdered kid, couldn’t have done more to draw lines in the sand.I’m also glad that those two groups are teaming up to shill the father as a Christ like figure &amp; claim his behavior is just pure wholesome Christianity. If I had a nickel for every time Christianity was used as a defense &amp; deflection of faux Rightist subversive savage worshippers I’d be richer than Trump &amp; that’s not an exaggeration. The more these people expose themselves as willful supporters of pure evil &amp; cowardice the better.

                    This is an illogical assumption.  There are plenty of “Metcalf-like” folk spread across generational cohorts.  That the Boomers are the largest cohort we have, there are plenty more Metcalfs, but such is not unique to Boomers.

                    There are two Jeffrey Metcalf’s in Frisco TX. They are 55 and 60 years old. So even by the most orthodox definition of Boomerhood, he’s GenX, not Boomer. Well maybe the very tail end of Boomer if he was born in later 1964 but I don’t buy that definition anyway.
He’s GenX and Boomers in general have adult children and often grandchildren, too old to have teenage children.

                        The solutions are the ones being presented by your generational cohort.
My solution is to remove anyone over 70 from the voting rolls. How do you like that solution? I’m moving the ball forward here! We’re proposin’ solutions!”

                            No you’re not presenting solutions, IMHO. But the concept has a hint of merit and worth a rejoinder.  An idea is rare coming from you, so I take special note.Let me expound and elaborate. I personally believe in “earned suffrage”. In short, fogging a mirror is not sufficient to partake in the direction of society.You wish to eliminate those over 70 from societal participation, but do not explain why. From your previous commentary, you simply don’t like “Boomers”. Hence you’ve not proposed a solution—except possibly for your own hatred and prejudice.I would entertain voting right exclusion for any and all “non-productive” citizens. One classification for of a non-productive citizen might be those who are on “public welfare”. The unemployed welfare recipient, or perhaps that “Boomers” on SSI. I’d also consider such exclusion for government employees—who derive their income from the public largess.The above is rough, and needs of course discussion, but it is an idea with a basis outside of shear intergenerational hatred.

            Events such as this, terrible though they are, change minds far more surely than all the clever arguments and mountains of evidence one can muster. Metcalf’s murder turned hundreds of thousands, perhaps a million, whites implacably against the Hutus. And this is why the media has always tried so hard to suppress the reality of negro savagery.

                Well said. Its the emotional reaction that really drives change, pity &amp; guilt can’t really coexist with disgust &amp; resentment, its an either/or thing.I hope they floyd up the vacant faced murderer &amp; his pre-historic ape mother, plaster them all over the media. Just looking at them triggers something primordial inside me, I see them &amp; I just have this gut reaction of disgust.That feeling is so suppressed in normal people but when something horrific happens like this &amp; they rub in our faces &amp; do it in the most gorilla way possible it becomes much more difficult to bury that feeling.When that child was murdered by that fat gorilla with her tits hanging down to her kneecaps &amp; was smugly smiling in court I witnessed people who are implicit shitlibs on autopilot (not real true believers just going along with the moral blacks are victims flow) become very racially aware.As much as I dislike &amp; distrust Elon Musk him allowing the world to see bantu for what they are on twitter has been a Godsend, he deserves whole lot of credit for that.

            She’ll need to move immediately, as some Karen from the state house there has issued an official notice that the incident is being investigated for “hatred to incite violence”. Translation: If she hasn’t fled yet, by the end of business today, CPS will take her children from her. Once removed, they’ll be placed with a black foster family where they’ll eventually be murdered.

                I didn’t even think of CPS. I did think she needs to get the hell out of there but damn, that’s dark.
She should maybe hand the kids off to a squeaky clean family member until this concludes but I don’t even know if that could stop the state from taking them. Probably not, if I’m be realistic, even if it wasn’t allowed on paper the government has demonstrated time &amp; again that it will operate with impunity laws be damned.

They despise us anyway, they’ll look at it as an early elimination of two future racists and that is how they will justify it.Update: the local cops there have put out a BOLO on her.

                Even though Shiloh appears to be a tatted up, downcast White single mom (not all confirmed) and probably not our ideal standard bearer, I think it’s important to show solidarity with her.  As soon as I confirmed her other child was in fact White, I was comfortable making the donation.  As of this post the GiveSendGo is up to $364,000 with almost 13,500 people donating.  It’s only been a little over 24 hours, the goal is now $1,000,000.

        the nigs are in far more trouble than they realize.  as the white percentage of the population goes down, so does tolerance for negro antics.  mexicans full on ethnically cleanse blacks out of the places they are colonising.  asians are openly contemptuous of black “monkeys”, even imported africans don’t feel kinship with american negroes.  once the boomers are gone, nigs will be greatly reduced in numbers, one way or the other.  and no one is going to subsidize negroes like the white boomers did.

            Old white conservatives have massive white guilt. They are a large demographic so they still influence their kids or younger shitlibs. Once they pass into the next life, the only ones holding the Big Bag o’ Guilt will be the young shitlibs and black race hustlers. They will be as relevant as those saying now that The Vatican is the dark center of power.

                    Having had such screenings and the finding of cancer, I would ask that people consider such *if* they have secondary indications of pathology—like blood in stool, or spastic colon, family history, or such other indications.  Colonoscopy “for all” is not high on my list, nor it seems most other country’s national health care systems.  But we are Americans and in thrall of the medical industrial complex.  🙁However, such procedure worked for me and the cancer was found just before spread and was removed during examination.  Indeed, the possibility of cancer spread/invasion, but *at that time* undetectable, haunted me for years.  However, this beats a removed colon segment, resection, possible anus removal, and a colostomy “bag”.  My father died of this after living a few miserable years after major surgery.Your choice.  Mine of course would have been a quick exit if that (invasive cancer) were my case.

            Not sure that’s entirely true. They still have a sizable amount of the population convinced they are magic. It’s not boomers putting them in every TV commercial, or boomers buying ghetto rap, or boomers entirely worshiping the sportsballers. Their stock might be falling, but it’s still returning great dividends.

                    Aside from the cohort imbalance of Boomers, I’d say we’ve reached the point where race reality (understanding) *has* been reached, albeit not at the Overton window level.  The rejection of “equality” that Z-man hints at is real and in effect.  It is the logical end when all other explanations have been postulated and rejected based upon observable reality.

                        This is all silly. You blame the people who actually did it. While it may be popular to blame Sicilians for what Capone did, or all noggerdom for the dozen murders nogs will pull this weekend in Chicago, the simple fact is that’s not truth.
I’m almost 100% certain Clarence Thomas won’t be involved in the latter, nor that Scalia had anything to do with St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. You generalize to the point it still fits the facts, and not beyond.

                AI Answer to question:
“While specific numbers for millennial women in advertising aren’t readily available, women make up a significant portion of the advertising industry, with some sources indicating they represent 55% of the workforce. This number has also shown growth, from 51% in 2019 to 55% currently. The advertising industry is also experiencing a significant shift towards gender equity, with some data indicating that 53% of global marketing roles are held by women, and they are also successfully scaling the ladder, accounting for 53% of manager-level or higher positions”

                    And i would bet most of the men who work in advertising are gay.  Think that would be a safe bet.  So really the amount of women that work in advertising is closer to 100% percent.

                    We don’t even have to do that much. We just have to play it like our grandfathers did. Establish our own productive ventures and trade amongst ourselves. We are still way more than enough to thrive.
BTW, anyone who is in sole proprietor or partnership, look into how your state does LLCs or C-corps or even S-corps. Assuming the Republicans cave, which is a safe bet, your tax bill will increase at least 50%.

            Egalitarianism is the validation of Boomer individualism. Accepting the blank slate means that anyone can be anything, and the boomers, the most privileged and least constrained generation in history, are about self creation above all.
It turns out Egalitarianism makes a virtue of selfishness much more easily than Objectivism. All protestations to the contrary, boomers don’t really care about the nons, but rather about justifying their own life choices. That’s how they can virtue signal for “civil rights”, but send their kids to private school without any apparent cognitive dissonance. Hey Man, you do you.

                That’s silly. Egalitarianism, the idea that all people are equal, is the polar opposite of individualism, that people are individuals, different from each other, hence, unequal.

            I don’t think you have any idea what you are talking about. Miscegenation was very unusual among the older cohorts. It doesn’t even appear on the radar until maybe mid-millennial. Coal burning was almost nonexistent except in Harper Lee rape fiction lit.

                    I really noticed it taking off (coincidentally) right when rap/hiphop became heavily promoted and ubiquitous. Early 1990s. Mudsharks existed before then of course, but they were more of a rare freak thing.

                    Agreed, though it is still quite rare, apparently. According to AI, interracial marriages (all types) in the US was 2% in 1970, 7% in 2005, and 8.4% in 2010. Apparently, it couldn’t find anything more recent, but I doubt it’s decreased. It seems doubtful to me that the 20% increase in miscegenation between 2005 and 2010 were primarily from Boomers and their cursed individualism. I mean, the youngest Boomers would have been in their 40s…

            True. But ask just about anybody of any race or ethnicity how they feel about the nuggras and they’ll swoon and gush and protest their most fervent adoration. It’s a lie, of course, but the vast majority of people are still terrified of being thought racist against the nuggs. It will take some time for the racial derangement to dissipate.

                That’s one of my favorites to bring up. Most people can’t remember whether it was the Hutus or the Tutsis who were getting machete manicures and waving their newly-shorn appendages to the film crews and begging for relocation. Everybody agreed it was awful and we needed to let all the Tutsis in. More interesting is the fact that the Hutus say that a generation before, it was the Tutsis running around and loppingtheirarms off and they were just getting even. So we let in a bunch of machete-waving savages for being the victimsthis timeand ignored the fact that they were doing the same stuff a decade earlier.I use this example because it’s simple and easy. You’ve got 2 parties. Capulets and Montagues in faire Verona, if you will. Or perhaps the Coonpulets and the Monkeygues of Verogadishu. The truth of the matter is that all subsaharans besides the Igbo are one bad week away from going cannibal. The Igbo are their own problem and the people most likely to phone scam you besides Indians and Pakistanis.

        Why is “racism” a sin? The concept itself is a made up modern term, as mentioned, and so why should it be cast as a moral issue? Ironically, it’s blacks who harbor bitterness towards whites for no apparent rational reason, while whites go out of their way to “not be racist” while having actual rational reasons for wanting to avoid them. If you’ve been around them you know why there were historic stereotypes and it wasn’t just because one day, for no reason at all, the white man decided he hated anyone with dark skin. That’s cartoon morality and history, and we need to teach our people to stop buying into this crap at all. Just like the dreaded “antisemitism”, “racism” has no meaning and should be treated with callous indifference.

Because it behooved the Council of the Sanhedrin to declare that it was a sin.
In particular, it allowed White Christian people to start asking themselves, “Why are there so many sh!tskins flooding our nation?”
Instead ofWhite Christian people asking themselves, “Why are there so many hooknoses flooding our nation?”

You’re wasting all of your psychological energy worrying to death about the effects of Hart-(((Cellar))) whilst your Mortal Enemies are busy looting the Federal Reserve, and inoculating your children with MRNA v@xxines, which will render your descendants completely sterile [unable to produce viable progeny] within a few short generations.

And you have to confess that it worked flawlessly; what did Amurrikkkunz fear moast in calendar year 2020:
A) Being accused of racism for not kneeling before the likeness of Saint George Floyd the Pious?
-OR-
B) Not being inoculated with the depopulationist v@xxine poisons?
Everyone was terrified of being labelled a “racist”, whilst, simultaneously, everyone was also starting to be poisoned by the most horrifying medical inoculation the world had ever known.

            it’s blacks who harbor bitterness towards whites for no apparent rational reasonI don’t know if its rational but imagine it from their perspective. Imagine your race has been conquered &amp; turned into farm equipment by empire after empire &amp; you’re faced with the inescapable reality that you’re the most pathetic ape species to walk this earth, it tends to build resentment. The highest achieving race coddles you, spoils you out of a sense of guilt because of how utterly pitiful you are has to be condescending.You know this is true because their words don’t match their actions, they gaslight you about how amazing you are &amp; then do everything in their power to avoid you like the plague because they can’t stand to be in your presence. Meanwhile your highest aspiration in life is be near those people who want nothing to do with you because you create horrific living conditions you yourself can’t stand to exist in.Then there’s the dissonance, you have an average IQ that makes you functionally retarded so you have the worst case of Dunning-Kruger &amp; so believe you’re amazing &amp; skilled. At the same time you can’t escape the reality that you must constantly cry about how you’re a helpless victim in order to get resources from the people you claim you’re better than because you cannot create anything of value &amp; are incapable of sustaining yourself.You implicitly understand your weak &amp; hated by everyone so your only other sense of pride other than overestimating your abilities is acting as a genetic pollutant &amp; invasive parasite. Its not exactly flattering when the go-to insult against your enemies is that you have better sexual prowess &amp; that you’ll use your own disgusting genes as a weapon to degrade their beauty. You also know everyone considers you to be a primitive subspecies so you also claim your the progenitors of the people you hate to claim to be the same as which inadvertently reinforces the idea you’re less evolved.None of these things are coming from a position of strength which really stings when you come from a culture that is obsessed with being strong barbarians.Honesty it makes sense that they hate &amp; resent Whites more than anyone, they’re the complete inverse of them in every, and the worst, possible way. They’re constantly &amp; aggressively reminded of the unpleasant reality of their condition while existing in a White society.

                    The ironclad law of ecological dynamical systems holds that necessarily a parasite must eventually EVOLVE to become less harmfully parasitic to its host; else the parasite will kill off all possible hosts which it could hope to parasitize, and thereby disappear into extinction.
To a parasite, it is of the utmost importance to EVOLVE as quickly as possible so as to insure the long term SAFETY of its host.
tl;dr == PARASITISM -&gt; SYMBIOSIS.

                “The concept of envy — the hatred of the superior — has dropped out of our moral vocabulary. The idea that white Christian civilization is hated more for its virtues than its sins doesn’t occur to us, because it’s not a nice idea. Western man towers over the rest of the world in ways so large as to be almost inexpressible. It’s Western exploration, science, and conquest that have revealed the world to itself. Other races feel like subjects of western power long after colonialism, imperialism and slavery have disappeared. The charge of racism puzzles whites who feel not hostility, but only baffled good will, because they don’t grasp what it really means: humiliation. The white man presents an image of superiority even when he isn’t conscious of it. Superiority excites envy. Destroying white civilization is the inmost desire of the league of designated victims we call ‘minorities.’” — Joseph Sobran (April 1997)

                Isn’t this basically Sam Francis’ premise? That blecks know they can’t accomplish anything of substance so their anti-whiteness is just envy. I think this is probably true for the smarter, more self-aware ones. But the left-side of bell curve functional retards that make up a big portion of them aren’t pondering anything more than basic animal urges. I still think a lot of them aren’t necessarily envious out of a sense of inferiority so much as they just want dem gibs and dem whypeepo got em. Base animal instinct but not really rational.

                    You really got me thinking with this, when I wrote that I didn’t think about envy at all, I was thinking about their subconscious hatred for all civilized things &amp; beings, their entitlement &amp; belief that because they’ve been victims for so long they’re owed gibs. At the same time they resent the fact they have to subsist off gibs &amp; do every single psychological cope in the book from stealing other people’s histories to constantly inventing new theories as to how they’re oppressed by Whites to avoid the elephant in the room which is that they’re pathetic.They’re dumb but they’re like toddlers in that they can perceive subtext even if they can’t consciously grasp it. Its like a self conscious person lashing out at someone he admires because he hates that he’s not like him.But I guess that would be envy which is certainly part of it but I also think mixed with entitlement, bitterness, coping &amp; hatred of civilization generally. Like how leftists hate jews in israel because relative to their neighbors they’re advanced but in America they’re just another degenerative minority group dismantling civilization so they love them here.I don’t think any nog or leftist for that matter truly grasps their subconscious drive, like I don’t think leftists actually think to themselves they want to destroy Western civilization &amp; then get eaten alive by the savages they import. Same logic applies to the nogs, if you asked those instinctive ones who just want gibs about poverty I guarantee they’d instantly do the woe is me routine. They talk about crime &amp; poverty like its a weather condition that White people have total control of implying they have no agency &amp; are totally at the whim of Whites.I also think they’re bitter that they live under White rule but instinctively understand that its the White guilt that gets them coddled. According their kang status they should be dominating us through raw force which is what they normally would do but they’re forced to be subversive &amp; that drives them up the wall.I think its reductionist to view everything I said from the lens of envy, there’s definitely some layers to it.I guess the word I would use instead of envy is contemptuous but that’s definitely in the same wheelhouse as envy so I guess I was dancing in that same ballpark.Apologies for the haphazardly written stream of conscious reply, it was either that or likely not respond at all since I’d likely forget to come back &amp; formulate my thoughts on this since I have a busy weekend ahead of me &amp; I’m heading out for the night soon. Hopefully it wasn’t too incoherent lol.

                        Naw, not haphazard, and very well reasoned. I think contemptuous is a pretty good descriptor. I still ponder whether the anger they hold is from a place of subconscious inferiority or just anger because they are convinced they are better and are resentful they can’t flex even more that they already do.I disagree that some leftists don’t know they are promoting society destroying ideas. The vast majority are the useful idiots, but there is certainly an educated cohort who are disciples of Gramsci and Mercuse and know damn well what they’re doing. I do think their pets turning on them is just what Bob Ross would call “a happy little accident.” Unplanned and utterly delicious.Thanks for the great posts.

                            You’re right, I misspoke when I generalized about leftists lack of self awareness, I meant like the general leftist horde, the hivemind’s collective thoughts. There certainly are those who know exactly what they’re doing &amp; usually they tend to be thought leaders but not always.As for the what drives nog resentment its probably both fluid &amp; dependant on the individual &amp; group.Like the nation of islam acknowledges how degenerative blacks are but blames it on jews who are the thought leaders &amp; views Whites as complicit. They’re the exception because most blacks in my experience deny any sort of degeneracy whether outright or by claiming Whites are too stuck up and/or too soft.Its probably dependant on how detached from reality they are both consciously &amp; subconsciously. I know very intelligent people who are basically automatons, they’re not even remotely aware of what’s driving them. That plus intelligence &amp; I also think the underlying resentment is fluid even among individuals.Say someone is dirt poor in the projects but then gets drafted into the NBA, I’d be shocked if the nature of their resentment didn’t change along with their status, for example. I imagine its fluid &amp; highly context sensitive.Those “lets get dem gibs” types will become woe is me types when they inevitably go to prison, if it weren’t for the White devil he could steal without consequence.It probably can’t be pinned down to one specific reason outside of general ethnocentrism which itself takes the form of negative &amp; positive, inward &amp; outward. There’s also the sports team aspect of humans at play too, we produce archetypes to serve roles that were adapted over time. So in the case of blacks you have some that are primitive savages &amp; then some that are effectively subversive ambassadors.Think of the self isolating orthodox jews who act as the breeding colony, if they were all like that they wouldn’t be very effective. But they’re not, a certain percentage of them leave &amp; go off to the wider society &amp; blend in while still maintaining their identity &amp; loyalty to the group. Those that go out into society will have different roles to play all serving the collective group.The only thing that seems universal is the ethnocentrism itself, resentment itself is a form of this, it acts like a glue that keeps them together &amp; provides them a just cause from their perspective.Sorry for the late reply by the way.

            It’s simply a bludgeon used by highbrow whites against lowbrow whites, that’s all. It has nothing to do with the actual merits or demerits of the Negroes themselves.
It’s not as if the highbrow whites actually love Negroes. They aren’t exactly importing thousands of them into Martha’s Vineyard or Marin County or the Hamptons.
Tell you what: propose a low-income housing project on Martha’s Vineyard and see how fast the very people who claim “I’m not racist” oppose having Negroes around.

            Things run in cycles, unless they are completely crushed. Take Communism for example. It has been so discredited it is unlikely to make a comeback without serious modifications. The concept of racism won’t die completely because we live in a multicultural world. As I say, things run in cycles. Even if racist-mongering were to go away tomorrow, it would be in vogue in another generation or two. There’s no escaping the beast.

                Probably a side effect of the (poor) programming.  Just read and note how the “response” does not reflect upon the original comment?  It hangs together, but does not contribute to the “conversation”.The simplest way to disprove, or support the assertion that Nikolic is *not* an AI spambot, would be for him to respond to this comment with a quote and a direct rebuttal to this comment.  I maintain this can never happen with “his” AI programming.What I don’t understand is how Z-man can tolerate this repeated spamming or remain silent wrt these regular postings of Nikolic.  We know Z-man responds to commenters here on a regular basis, so he reads the commentary as he has time.  Why no comment in memory from Z-man on this particular commenter?This makes me think there may a connect between Z-man and the spambot “Nikolic”.  What this connection is, is beyond me.  Perhaps a general IQ test of his audience?  We do get a whole bunch of down votes for any particular Nikolic posting, and the occasional well meant response.  Are we part of an experiment?  Are we unwittingly helping to improve the Nikolic AI program?

I’d guess that when posted, this was the #1 most liked thread. That way, “Greg”s comment doesn’t get scrolled to the very bottom.

                    I wouldn’t be surprised if “Greg” showed up on other blogs with large followings. Trying to move people to his stupid GeoCities-era website.
Or, “Greg” is from Calcutta and is content farming.
Or, The Z-Man’s middle name is Greg and his mother’s maiden name is Nikolic, and Z has created a character that tries to write like him, but is failing miserably so far. But why link to that stupid website?
What a mystery!

                    The funny thing about Greg-AI is that it has an AI for an avatar pic. It was always staring us in the face.I am going to take a swipe at the IQ test angle because people will falsely believe this is an IQ test.First problem is that good faith, high trust environments engender a powerful illusion that papers over most errors as a form of grace, which, altogether, is a powerful social tool in the right context. Greg-AI becoming a bad parody of a horny teenage male upon the “purity” prompt broke the illusion and the grace that went with it.It is now more obvious that Greg-AI is generating each line based on previous lines with a couple special rules or training to break the pattern into forming a rough, essay-like structure, particularly with this latest comment. As chatbots do.This leads to the second problem and where my original take of freshman college brain comes in. A conceited, college educated sophist plays concept association games where they make massive leaps of non-logic, and the mystery in between the concepts is treated as profound so the audience can insert any meaning or insight they like into those gaps, which creates the perception of intelligence for the sophist. Greg-AI roughly emulates that on the basis of loose word associations, or word probability calculations, which is the symbolic stand-in for the loose concept association games of modern commie sophists.So Greg-AI is more a test of what it takes to break a good faith environment and if someone has the experience and pattern-matching prowess to spot a chatbot without mistaking them for a Dunning-Kruger reddit commie. In my defense, Greg-AI gets pretty close on a good day, and I started skimming its output and skipping to the replies for the banter pretty quickly.Which helps explain why tech bros are so enamored with AI and the possibility of AGI. It outputs text in a roughly similar pattern to the disordered, untrained and conceited liberal mind – “It’s just like me.”

        The fact that some chick in Mogadishu MN has managed to get 250k$ in less than 24 hours defending herself from a Somali chomo screaming “racist” is a strong support for Zman’s point. Black fatigue seems to be reach8nf structurally dangerous levels.

            A second order problem is that there are people willing to send large sums money to temporary celebrities who did stupid shit. Obviously this is a profit incentive for companies like GiveSendGo. Granted that there are real victims with legitimate needs for charity, but it would seem to be subsidizing potentially dangerous behavior from some people soliciting funds.

        An interesting topic the day after a working class white woman crowd funds $250k in support after a video is posted of her calling a little thief the most magic of words in a Minnesota public park.  Local media in Minnesota, who would normally salivate over a story like this haven’t even mentioned it.  There is no discussion of charging her with a crime and much of the focus has justifiably shifted to why the Somali creep who recorded her was in the park to begin with.  This is the kind of person the left viscerally hates, yes they doxxed her, but nothing else has happened so far.  Are they just planning on using the courts to outlast Trump and then sweep everything away and then some once they return to power?

            I should add doing a more extensive search, Rochester police have put out a statement that they are investigating and the Minneapolis Star Tribune ran a very short story on it.  Attention needs to shift to the creep recording her. Put pressure on the police to investigate why he was at the park and what other crimes he has committed.

                    As soon as I saw where that happened I instantly understood why she immediately setup donations. She’s going to need every penny to first of all move away to not get head hunted &amp; then money for a lawyer though after the Chauvin trial I’m not sure there’s much point in spending money on that.With the legal system beingthatrigged what’s the point when your fate is already pre-ordained. Maybe she should hire a lawyer after the conviction for the appeal but even that might be pointless. Guess it’ll all depend on what judge she gets, if its the same as Chauvin’s then might as well save the money at that point &amp; use a public defender- the outcome will be the same regardless.

                        Whatever they come up to charge her with cannot be a serious crime without a ridiculous overcharge. If she gets to a red state, I could easily see them refusing to cooperate with Minnesota on any pursuit of her.

                        The organized Left would already have her living in another state under a different name. Especially now that they are on high alert for undercover cops searching for illegals. The Right is, I fear, going to wait for the inevitable arrest, demonization, trial, conviction, and then a classical chorus “she’ll win on appeal.”My hope is that this sentiment is now dampened on the Right after witnessing what has happened to Trump at the hands of district court judges. Trusting in the State and “the laws” and courts has to stop, and this would be a fine beginning to that movement.

                            The whole system is steadily chipping away at its legitimacy but I don’t think we’re gonna see a real genuine shift until boomers phase out.Once boomers retire all the positions they hold will be filled by DEI &amp; that’s going to accelerate everything very quickly. Quality of life is going to nosedive which is going to make people way less tolerant &amp; the less White the state gets the more openly hostile, corrupt &amp; most importantly alien its going to appear to the average White person.Like that black judge who cut the killer’s bond down, we can expect that behavior to become the norm. Its going to get really ugly but the upside is that Whites are going to be forced against their will to stop believing in the legitimacy of the state.The open question is how many Whites will be around when that finally happens &amp; how many of them are even salvageable. Still this DEI business is going to ultimately be beneficial, I’d prefer my genocidal government be staffed by corrupt brown morons.Another angle to consider is the inevitable infighting among the browns when they become the majority. The diverse government will be lucky to keep electricity &amp; running water around let alone keep the peace between the 50 different races, tribes &amp; ethnic groups that are here.Its going to be very chaotic in the days ahead.

Somehow neither woman got the message that as fellow “BIPOC” they were not antagonists but natural allies against the evil white racist oppressor.
After a few days it dropped off the news.

            I saw that. Astonishing, really.
Niggermania is largely a boomer thing. A lot of them (at least around here) never really had any close contact with diversity. As they begin to age out their stupidity will go with them. Race reality hits most people that get immersed in it eventually.

        “Racism” as a notion is coming from the Kosher Nostra. If you ask the typical white liberal why racism is bad, you’ll get some hemming and hawing, clearing of the throat, shuffling of feet, maybe some moral diatribe. A century ago race differences were understood to be a reality and not worth discussing. Even today most people know it but the suffocating atmosphere means they can’t talk about it openly but must dress it up in euphemisms — e.g., that particular school district is not that great, that neighborhood is one you want to avoid, oh, and isn’t Dr. Ben Carson absolutely brilliant?Racism as a notion is just to make white people ashamed of themselves and to ignore the bitter reality of the wonders of multicultural life.

            The Ben Carson one is a scream. My dad is a boomer and comes with canned boomer talking points. He used to prove to people that even though he was meritocratic, he wasn’t racist. He’d state that if one of his kids needed brain surgery he wouldn’t care whether the scalpel-jockey was white, only that he was qualified. Then he’d puff out his chest, tilt his head up, and inform the unlucky individual he was bloviating at that the best neurosurgeon in the US happened to be black. I don’t want to rag on boomers too much, but somebody once said that arguing with them is a waste of time because you’re arguing with the TV by proxy.

                Ben Carson was the ideal Black, non-threatening with a good career gig.  He was the epitome of the Civil Rights era.  The idealization of what “good Whites” desired to accomplish by their efforts on the era.  He of course was the exception, not the rule.

            Aye. The concept of racism can be traced directly to Shoah Business. Because, if you disapprove your little Kaylee shacking up with some feral Quan’T’ayvius that means you want to refire Bergen-Belsen. That is the argument–entirely normal racial chauvinism equals incipient genocide.

        St. John ChrysostomDoctor of the Church*And so says Isaiah, the chief of the Prophets, You shall not overlook your kinsmen of your own seed. Isaiah 58:7, Septuagint For if a man deserts those who are united by ties of kindred and affinity, how shall he be affectionate towards others? Will it not have the appearance of vainglory, when benefiting others he slights his own relations, and does not provide for them? And what will be said, if instructing others, he neglects his own, though he has greater facilities; and a higher obligation to benefit them?Will it not be said, These Christians are affectionate indeed, who neglect their own relatives? He is worse than an infidel. Wherefore? Because the latter, if he benefits not aliens, does not neglect his near kindred. What is meant is this: The law of God and of nature is violated by him who provides not for his own family… It was the design of God, in uniting us by the ties of kindred, to afford us many opportunities of doing good to one another…Because it is not the same thing to neglect our kindred, as to neglect a stranger. How should it be? But the fault is greater here, to desert one known than one who is unknown to us, a friend than one who is not a friend.”-Commentary on 1 Timothy 5:8,“But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.”notice how St. Paul distinguishes between “his own” and his own house. So there’s a more expansive “own” than just the immediate family.conservatives think that “one’s own” only extends to immediate family maybe first cousins and aunts and uncles.

            I’ve taken a liking to watching golf on tv. The absence of dieversity is enjoyable.* I’m sure it bothers the PGA, and they probably have a highly paid committee that discusses how to get more negros involved.One thing that separates it from other sports is the proximity of the fans (who are 100% white) to the players (who are 99% white). Often, they are right on top of them, very close, touching distance. Yet everyone is so quiet and well behaved. I play a mental game where I try to picture what that would look like if the crowd was negro instead.*but the golf club commercials are still full of negros

                I prefer hockey. Blacks are about as common as they are in PGA,  but in hockey, white boys beat the crap out of them to cheering crowds. Sometimes they take a bow to the cheers when the white overlords sentence them to their penalty — 2 minutes.

        *[Regarding marriages between whites and Negroes] That there are lines between classes of people is a certainty that may as well be acknowledged at once, and the color-line is one of them. While it is entirely possible to ignore these lines, the social effect of such action is seldom happy. Just as a member of the true Church is earnestly dissuaded from marriage, by dispensation, with a non-member, so should a member of one race be dissuaded from marriage with a person of another color. In marriages of either type, there is a definite injustice done to children, there are almost inevitable misunderstandings between the parties themselves, and there is sure to be some friction between the families so gracelessly united.Paul Glenn Class Manuals in Philosophy, Sociology, (1941)

                    The saddest part of all was illustrated by our illustrious President Obama who threw his White grandparent under the bus when she was dying.  The very parent who stuck by him and made him everything he had become.  If not for her, he’d have been a ghetto rat.  Especially true in the 60’s and 70’s when there was particular shame in a White parent dragging around a half caste grandchild.  Obama chose his side.  In that respect I hold him in lower esteem that his wife, Micheal—who was always a low level Black with no redeeming genetic aspects to cling to.

        Everyone around here vastly underestimates the effectiveness of racial equality propaganda.  Probably close to 80% of Whites buy this BS and actually believe it.
Have we inched the numbers of non-believers up a little bit in the past 10 years, perhaps. But we are nowhere near a White awakening.  It’s not primarily boomers as everyone likes to pretend.  Millennials and Zoomers are even more egalitarian than Xers and Boomers.  I personally know some zoomers who, despite having to arrange their lives around avoiding blacks throw a hissy-fit if they hear any un-vetted words.

Nope. To your point, one doesn’t have to look any further than the reactions of parents whose children were killed by blacks (see Metcalf, Jeff). Sure it is sad that their child was killed but what really makes them angry is race realists saying things concerning their child’s death that point to any race realism concerning the attack and the perp.

        I havnt listened yet, but I have a hard time believing racism is going anywhere. I know white millennials conservatives committed to fighting racism. And the religions are full behind it even the phony Vatican 2 religion. Look at the conservative Ed Fessers book on anti racism. If the crazies do back off for now, racism as a bull whip against whites will just be doing push ups waiting for the next saint Floyd.Other thing to think about is the presence of non whites among us. They restrict our ability to live out our culture to go where we want (there are parts of this country where whites are not welcome). It’s our duty to provide a homeland and habitat for our children.so a walking back of racism won’t do. Jefferson insisted they must go and how has that changed?!? Tell me why now is different than 200 years ago? It’s probably more evident and necessary now than then to physically separate from these people for good.saying racism is on its heals is affirming that we can “all just get along “ it’s an affirmation that this country is synthetic and can only function with penal laws pretending non whites are Americas, it won’t do, they all have to go

        Cancel the USAID money and cut the NGOs off of the sweet government cheese, and the organized “racism” movement just dries up and blows away.  It quickly devolves back to the driveway and city park dustups from where it all began, where the real “multi-culti” education process goes on, one person at a time.

        But how did blacks become something as big as race?    Why can’t we just hate them on narrower grounds?   Like ethnicity?    Why have they been magnified into something more consequential?   Isn’t that part of the problem in dealing with them?
because when you bring race into the equation it’s almost as big as bringing God into the discussion.  There’s only a few races.  so it elevates them.  Blacks don’t warrant that level of attention.
but everyone gives them heightened attention.
I think people want to imagine there is more to them than there really is.

                I’ll gladly tell you that. I chose for my final place of residence a valley in which there are no residents of Sub-Saharan African extraction within a hundred miles and while that was not the primary reason for the choice, it played no small part in it. I’m a leading-edge boomer (’46), born and raised in NYC during its heyday, but have lived most of my adult life abroad. The South American country in which I’ve been living for the past 21 years has a tiny percentage of blacks clustered in cities, but for all practical purposes, the population of whites and mestizos is oblivious to them and has no hesitation in stating they wish it to continue that way. If that makes them (and me) “racists”, so be it, we’ll do our best to live with it.

        You wrote some time back that Karen/Chad cannot fathom that Shanika or Donquarius does not want to live like them. This observation has stuck with me more than anything else I’ve read here. Those projected preferences make basically all racial policies the same at the Indian Residential Schools–measures based on the assumption that everyone in the world wants to live in Brooklyn and enjoy craft beer and LGBTQ art galleries. Biological reality plays no role in this worldview, which does not withstand the least bit of scrutiny. “Delusion” doesn’t even come close as a descriptor.Everything comes down to race and to who/whom, or as you sometimes write, “who says?”. It is quite extraordinary that what has been recently considered the greatest sin, racism, is predicated on both a denial of that question and a simultaneous requirement to adhere to a hierarchy based on it. The suppression of racial reality for so long is both shocking and extraordinary even if it ends tomorrow.Sidenote: the somewhat accepted and fully justified Indian hatred is real but also a low-hanging way to point out race reality. It is similar to going after “anti-Semitism” when the real problem is anti-white racism.

        Kamala wasn’t even doing the “Vote for me or you’re a racist/misogynist” so the moral panic was subsiding even last year. (Though to be fair, she did do the “Vote for me or you’re a fascist” thing.) Then she got that entirely predictable BIPOC award right after she lost. Then that old black coot yelled at Trump during he SOTU.  And a few weeks later they tried to meme Karmelo. Nothing caught on. In fact, it probably opened the last few stubborn normie eyes who aren’t torching Teslas.Now that it’s Okay to Be Wary of Indians, that will create an opening where we can return to at least 1970s TV racism.

            I’ve said for a while that Indians are the straw that will break the camel’s back. Prejudice+power=racism, jews get an exemption because of their extended stays at German resorts back in the early 20th century. That combined with the extreme amount of indoctrination every Westerner goes through from K-12 and in university and media insures that you can’t bring up the fact that they (up until recently) had the power to unperson you from society for speaking negatively of them.No such luck for Indians. Yeah, they’re brown. But Americans have no history of “oppression” with them. They’re disproportionately wealthy and extremely disagreeable on a personal level, much less as a group. P+P=R doesn’t compute with them. A white guy hating Vivek is, to the masses, the same as a black guy hating Musk. Indians loudly and proudly proclaim they’re victims of the legacy of racism, but nobody normal buys it. People have been judging them on their character, or want thereof, and finding them wanting. More than that, it’s not a cultural issue. 3rd generation Indians are awful, albeit more comprehensible than 1st generation ones. Indians of all generational status also wave the flag and claim to be assimilationist. Yet they’re still awful.Once you start seeing tribes, you can’t go back. The one good thing Indians have done for the human race has been to give normal white people the first nudge down the hill of racial awareness, in the opposite direction of the cliff of racial suicide we had been steadily creeping towards.

                Never stay at a patel motel. If there’s a subcon working the check-in counter, walk out. There won’t be any hot water, the light bulbs will be missing or burned out, the pillows will smell like dirty hair, and there will be toenail clippings in the carpets.

            Happened to me today. I was talking to someone  and said something I thought was pretty tame, and some rando on the street looked at me and said something like “That’s the most Hitler-adjacent thing I’ve heard in a long time!”
I looked him in the eye and said something like, “Thank you for your kind words. It means a lot.”
He stared at me for probably 30 seconds, decided I was not being ironic, and hurried off. We a good laugh at his expense.

        The civil rights era ended in mass riots, the total destruction of our cities, chaos and violence in our schools (read “Race War in High School”), and incredible violence. White people responded by packing up and moving to suburbs, but still retained that latest guilt and shame that was instilled in them. This was used very effectively by our enemies for decades. But after this latest outburst of black violence and chaos, where our enemies delighted in opening the windows and taking in the smell of the burning tires at the mostly peaceful protests, White people had nowhere to run to. The state made sure of that. So, they responded by starting to abandon that latest guilt and shame. This is ironically the worst outcome for the enemies of the Whites, as taking advantage of that was such an effective tool for them. And that’s what it always was, a tool.

        The whole ‘racism equals prejudice plus power’ is entirely disingenuous and a way to keep the racket going long after anything remotely resembling racism against blacks can  be found.  Under this retarded definition, a White homeless guy is more privileged and powerful than Clarence Thomas.  It entirely avoids the aspect of interpersonal power, wealth and status.But what really baffles me is how anyone buys this obvious grift.  Sure, lots of people buy it because it benefits them in some  way.  But a lot of normal people just accept this as true.  It is so obviously stupid that I have a hard time believing someone with a 90 IQ couldn’t see the blatant BS inherent in the argument.

            The example I always use is if Lebron James is walking down the street and a bum calls him a racial epithet, it’s ridiculous to think that the guy with hundreds of millions of dollars is the person holding the power in that situation. They’ll say he benefits from institutional racism. Oh really? I’m sure if the white cops walked up and saw the bum calling him a mean word, they’d side with the bum out of racial solidarity? Nope. They’d be carting the bum off on vagrancy charges. The white cops would also probably charge a white guy in a suit with disturbing the peace for saying the same thing, but most people aren’t willing to admit that. In a last ditch effort, the leftist will play their hail mary and claim the bum is also a victim of the patriarchal racist capitalist system and is lashing out on behalf of it because he doesn’t understand his oppression. You can’t make this stuff up. They can. That’s why it’s a waste of time to say anything to them.

                By far the most puissant form of racism in AINO is that meted out to whites. And, if there’s any such thing as institutional racism, it operates on behalf of negroes who are uniformly venerated and promoted by AINO’s Power Structure.  The benefits of blackness are colossal. The wages of whiteness are ongoing subjugation and ultimately, perhaps, genocide.

            The only way the Left can win arguments is by redefining words and terminology or by confecting new theory to explain away their defeats. Linguistic integrity operates as a standard of truth they simply cannot meet. So, rather than admit they’re wrong, they explain their failures as a result of “false consciousness,” or they redefine racism as a group power dynamic rather than negative opinions based upon race and/or racial tendencies.

        For all you people complaining about Donald Trump and criticizing him for not getting anything done, the race card wouldn’t have been smashed to bits without him. We would continue to be ruled by craven cucks who capitulate at every sign of pushback. (Muh, that’s not who We are!™) Pathetically weak Republicans singing from the kumbaya songbook is why we have gotten to this point and why we have almost lost this country.Rush Limbaugh talked about it before Trump ran. Of course, he talked in code, about how people who talk to him were afraid that we were about to lose this country. My interpretation was that this is exactly what he was talking about.

            Where do you see the race card smashed to bits?  I disagree with that aspect of today’s post.  The racism bit is plenty alive and well.  Every job opening I see, every ridiculous gripe by scum bag politicians is all about white privilege and supremacy.  I don’t see that anything changed at all.  In fact, I feel like it’s gotten worse.

                Yes. That is the paradox. Not only has White Erasure not receded, but it is ever more entrenched. Just 5 years ago it was needing more blacks in tech. Now every search result on a technical article is written by a black. That isn’t an accident. The search engines and the tech aggregator sites are doing this as a matter of policy. Last year the omni presence of blacks in ads in niches that are basically non-black was the thing. Now the next phase is upon us. They have gone from we need more blacks to, we have more blacks and they are at the top of search results, conference seminars … …The there is the imagery and messaging of the careers sites, the candidate welcome packages … … It is all thoroughly imbued with White Erasure.Of course, that means that Whites are beyond noticing, and can no longer run from it. You can run from what is pushing you out once it is not a city center but every aspect of life.This means that Whites either capitulate and their grandkids face Zimbabwe, or the embrace racial consciousness and in-group/out-group organizing and engagement. I think a significant percentage will choose the latter. It won’t be 50% to start. Eventually I do think that 50% will make an affirmative choice.Racism from that perspective will be dead. It’s life depended upon Whites quietly acquiescing and choosing the path of least resistance to carry on free of conflict. We are past that point. The system is bent against us and it is not hidden any longer. I don’t know a single young White person who cares what you call them anymore. Once they reach the point where they don’t care what any outsider thinks of them things get interesting. That day is fast arriving.The Woke isn’t being put away. It isn’t Woke. It is nothing new under the sun. It is a thinly veiled presentation of ethnic rivalry bent on ethnic conquest and domination. The Regime isn’t done with the hyper looting phase. It wants all it can grab. That means forcing Whites into a total mass foreclosure.

                Racial preferences is not the same as race card.
I agree it hasn’t been smashed, but you no longer need mountains of paperwork to establish that a member of the protected class is incompetent at his job. It’s still more onerous than for a white incompetent, but it’s already a massive improvement.

            Towards the end, and I argued that here when Rush was alive, Rush talked about race openly—not in code.  The talked about Whites and Blacks, but most often Whites as verses “others”.  Yes, he did not speak as strongly as we do, but he did speak of race when others never mention such directly.  And yes, Rush never spoke of generalized, innate differences.  In that, there were good Blacks and bad Blacks so to speak, but never “all” Blacks.

                Rush addressed race more openly than anyone else in radio.  I recall in 2003 when he questioned Donovan McNabb’s over hype as simply being a black qb.  His magical negro bit about Obama was edgy even though he was mimicking a black writers statements

        Speaking of racism and why it exists, here’s a Minneapolis area Jewess named Julia Ramos (yes, she grew up in St. Petersburg, Russia) who moved into a new neighborhood and has decided to torment her neighbors over their kids playing basketball in the driveway. She even went to get a TRO against her neighbor.
Makes me want to stuff an envelope full of Nazi memes and send it to her.

            I know you’re probably joking, but please don’t. This yenta is acting unhinged for absolutely no reason and it makes her look much worse than if she were able to pull out a post-marked envelope full of pictures of cats in stahlhelms. We’d all get a chuckle. She’d have a psychotic break. But the public would waffle and say “well, somebody went a little too far, so maybe she’s not such a lunatic after all.” The beauty of kosher paranoia is that it doesn’t require any encouragement.

You also don’t know about the unintended consequences. Maybe the next door neighbors are cucks and once you start harassing her like that, they may capitulate because, you know, racism is the worst crime that ever existed.

        Racism is not the top priority of the tribe until Israel feels safer. Liberal women, in particular, only get hysterical when told to be hysterical by the media.

Judges are making sure that nothing dramatic is changed domestically. So the fighters against racism can resume pretty much where they left off once reinstalled in power.

        This is clueless regarding “All in the Family” and that other Norman Lear TV show.
The reason the characters were called racist and then laughed it off was a demonisation of those characters, and by association, people who were identified with them.It wasn’t some endorsement of Archie Bunker or what Zedman is suggesting was normality.

            Norman Lear intended to demonize the Archie archetype.
Data and interviews after the fact as to the popularity of the show say otherwise. Including by Lear, himself.
Bruce Springsteen made born in the USA not as a ringing endorsement of America but as a critique of her policies. It didn’t stop Reagan from using it on campaign for other reasons. I wonder which popular interpretation of the song was held in greater regard?

                That doesn’t frame Archie or what he is supposed to represent as correct or desirable, however.As Devon Stack of Blackpilled would say: Eric Cartman is a popular character, but that doesn’t mean anyone wants to BE him or defend his Bunkeresque comments.
Or someone might resentfully identify with Cartman, but still accept the framing of being bad. They just want to be the bad guy.Or have unconvincing excuses for being the bad guy.
