        ABS can’t imagine any normal man watching the unwatchable ESPN show that has two minorities hosting it and who are clearly racists but one of those hosts,  Ms. Hill, is a twofer – she is a black and a woman – and so she gets two passes, at least, for when she does or says something a white man would have been fired on the spot for doing the same thing.Sure, she should have been fired for calling The POTUS a white supremacist but ABS thinks it just that ESPN continues to take the public relations battering it so rightly and richly deserves for its demented diversity project.ESPN truly does believe the way to gain popularity is to hire female NFL play-by-play announcers, and women to host NFL Pregame shows, and women to host ESPN Sports Center broadcasts.ABS DEMANDS ESPN keep Jemele on air and, in fact, ABS DEMANDS ESPN hire more minority female racists who are doomed to spend their lives yakking about sports invented by White Men.There has to be an entrepreneur who understands what is going on (Fox Sports, do you have the cojones?) and who will take advantage of this enormous opportunity and create a cable broadcast featuring normal white men talking about sports invented by white men and who will not corrupt the broadcast by promoting sodomy, feminism, racism, and communism and if such a thing comes to pass, ESPN will drag Disney down so deep that only Ariel could find it.

            why on earth do you think Fox sports isn’t as pozzed as espn?just read that lantern jaw’s ratings are down over 20% from last year (from Outkick The Coverage).  and this in a nutsac is why the prog’s are like a disease; they infect a company or institution and then kill it.   so i am very pleased that prog companies are killing themselves by bringing in these disease carriers.  we don’t have to outrun the bear of reality, we just have to outrun the progs (and that’s not too difficult because they are fat and slow and dumb).Zman, any chance you do a post about lifting?  do you follow any of the well known programs (5/3/1, Stronglifts, etc)?  i put down plywood with thick rubber mat in my garage, with a bench and a squat rack so i can lift at home.

        “We’re going to cuck. We’re going to cuck so much. We’re going to cuck on trade, we’re going to cuck on the border. We’re going to cuck so much, you’re going to be so sick and tired of my cucking, you’re going to come to me and go ‘Please, please, you can’t cuck anymore.’ You’ve heard this one. You’ll say ‘Please, Mr. President, we beg you sir, we don’t want you to cuck anymore. It’s too much. It’s not fair to everybody else.’” Trump said. “And I’m going to say ‘I’m sorry, but we’re going to keep cucking, cucking, cucking, We’re going to make Amnesty great again.”

        i have noticed that many many many people just say made up shit with absolute certainty; re: young people spouting gobbleygook in the podcast.   not just young people, not just progs, eveeryone.   i am a software engineer and writing software is very much like writing an article/book.   words have meaning and purpose and place; you cannot just put any word any place in a sentence.
my take is that these people in fact are incapable of thinking or talking rationally.  that this is a grave symptom of societal decay.

        The threshold of intelligence is so low these AA hires can’t form a concept of a non-minority that isn’t stereotypical and doesn’t sound like a verse in a rap tune.  Jemele sounds like a parrot that lives in the team locker room.

        Thanks for podcasting. I really appreciate the Friday dose of sanity and humor.  You really had me laughing this week between the ESPN and “Scientific Paper” reviews.  Makes being stuck in traffic not quite as vile.  Keep on doing what you are doing.
PS. Where did you find the theme music for the Labor Day podcast’s intro?

        I like the analogy there is no place in this country for child molesters.  Yet the Libs or progs give these pieces of scum a pass.
Liberal prison counselors recommend early release for pedophiles all the time even though there is 100% recidivism rate.
But go into hysterics calling their neighbors Nazis and white supremacist because they have a Trump sign in the front yard.
Such as the lunacy of the left.

        Z, what do you, as a lawyer, say to this?An Exit Interview With Richard Posner, Judicial Provocateur“Recently retired federal appeals court Judge Richard Posner said he rarely looked to legal rules when deciding cases and often sought to skirt Supreme Court precedent.“I pay very little attention to legal rules, statutes, constitutional provisions,” Posner told the New York Times in an interview published Monday. “A case is just a dispute. The first thing you do is ask yourself — forget about the law — what is a sensible resolution of this dispute?””Can’t now every one of his cases be appealed?I guess the only people who still think there is a rule of law, is people watching lawyer shows on TV.

        In regard to the “smiley face” watches, about 50 or so years ago this question was put to the advertisers who created magazine and billboard advertising. The answer was that this provided the best space to add a written message on the face of the watch.

        Best podcast yet. A lot of fun all around. Low blow on Frederic though. Still and all he loved the podcast also. I had the pleasure of playing it while I was teaching a prog college girl something at the bench (because sometimes I like giving pain). She couldn’t stop herself from laughing three times. Nice touch.

        In Ohio State’s defense Mx LeMay is an English professor, so I guess she can do whatever the hell she wants in that department. I will vouch for our Engineering and Physical Sciences though!
She is the second most famous LeMay to come out of the university, the most famous being Gen Curtis LeMay (an engineer)…
