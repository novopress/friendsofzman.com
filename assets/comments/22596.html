        While we‚Äôre at it, it‚Äôs time to start voting for universal gibs, starting with universal health care. As it stands now, we‚Äôre the only group not getting it. If the treasury is to be looted, let‚Äôs get some of that money flowing our way. Same with anything the government is handing out. The response shouldn‚Äôt be ‚ÄúBut muh deficits,‚Äù but rather, ‚ÄúMoar, moar, moar. And for our people too.‚Äù I, for one, am tired of being a sucker.

            Absolutely.  My ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù always made me fall for those ideas that we need to save money and not have debt and the government should encourage self-sufficiency.  Nobody else is following that program other than white people and our taxes pay for pretty much everything.  Can you imagine the crushing impact it would have if we all just quit paying our credit cards and car payments and declared bankruptcy and voted for Yang Bux checks to be delivered monthly?  I would crush the system.  But unfortunately, we keep playing by the rules as we are slowly bled out.

            My wife and I got divorced a year ago, so we pay lower taxes and get more college aid. We are also taking as much college debt as we can get, in case it is forgiven one day.  Once the kids are graduated, we will remarry to max out our social security.

            Critically important. It goes along with the ‚ÄòSucker‚Äô stamp written on the average whiteys head. Every minority laugh at Joe Normie for being so gullible and rule following. It is time to act mad n-ggerish and rake in the gibs, cheat on your taxes w/o getting caught, pay based white people under the table in cash as often as possible etc. Milk the gubmint tit like the browns do and starve the beast.

        Often times, someone here will say ‚Äúbest ever‚Äù to one of your posts.  And I always (silently) disagree.  Because I have read all of your posts, and compare each new post to the full corpus.
This, in my un-humble opinion, is not only your absolute best post, but your most important.  Bravo sir, bravo.  Heading out to get some roses to throw on the stage üôÇ

            I‚Äôve thought the same, but wondered ‚Äúwhy is this post the best‚Äù, after all we said that yesterday, and the day before, etc.  Then I realized that today‚Äôs post resonated so much because I literally could predict the next paragraph, and the next, and the next.
In short, Z-man, you are replicating my thinking in your words.  I believe others may experience the same.  This is important.  We are no longer confused and searching.  Many thanks for your efforts here, they have born fruit.

            Agreed. This should be mandatory reading for every dissident.
No just dissidents. This is written in such a peaceful and rational way that dissaffected normiecons could easily be shown this too.

            I have been a faithful reader of this blog for many years and hail from the wild north of Alberta and look to this site as a harbor from the insanity of US politics and Good Lord, Canadian politics. I have to concur that this is the finest post I have ever read and am amazed how Z can articulate what I understand but can‚Äôt explain adequately. I hope Z realizes that this site is vitally important to preventing despair amongst the followers of our thing.

        Around the block from me there is a person with those ‚ÄúHate Has No Home Here‚Äù and ‚ÄúScience is Real‚Äù signs in their yard.  They also have one of those community library boxes in their front yard.

        Absolutely agree with this post. Society functions mainly because white people cooperate and follow the rules. It only takes a tiny number of us to completely flush it down the toilet. For example, in my city they stopped prosecuting shoplifting because it‚Äôs racist. Technically you don‚Äôt have to pay for anything and nobody is going to stop you if you just walk right out of the store with your items. Obviously this only works because most of us still pay. Just don‚Äôt pay.  I know it seems like anathema to shoplift but that‚Äôs the whole point. Society is oriented around ending ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù.  Paying is ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù which is why shoplifting ceased to be enforced.  For the greater good and the destruction of this system of tyranny that is unfolding, we have to stop cooperating. We have to break the rules that now only exist in our heads.  Urinate in public.  Litter.  Shoplift. Etc.  It‚Äôs a kind of revolt. None of these laws are enforced or criminalized anymore anyway. Drive the ‚Äúcommons‚Äù into the garbage so that our overlords are forced to submit under mountains of trash.

            this will in fact drive chain stores out of your community, which should be the goal.   this is going on in SF right now; Rite-Aid has effectively abandoned the city (shutting its stores there).   Soon you will have no pharmacies or grocery stores in that shit hole.

            my neighborhood is already drowning in garbage/litter  i hate it and don‚Äôt want to add to it, plus nobody would see my litter as making any kind of statement.  would much prefer to create small, quiet pockets of order/tradition/beauty.  Sort of like Orania.  if Boers can sustain an Orania in a hostile place like South Africa, we ought to be able to create white-friendly havens here.  They could be ‚Äúintentional communities‚Äù organized around a filter like religion or philosophy, to keep out unfriendlies.

                    Ultimately this is key. The reason the Left has engineered the intra-White civil war is because it wants to delay the day people realize they are a nation without a country.

When I‚Äôm in a white area I am very tidy and respectful.
I try to do my shopping at European specialty stores, or polish / Italian owned grocers. Shoplifting is not yet legal in Canada however I would have no moral issues doing it at Walmart, for instance. I would pay full price at the euro. grocers.

            Another thing you can do is always cook at home, always price match and buy the flyer items (on sale) at the supermarket.

The stores actually lose money on loss leading sale items. And their margins are lower on healthy fresh foods than the cereal aisle.

By cooking at home you cut out your 3rd world Uber eats driver as well as the illegal alien kitchen staff, while also improving your health and saving money.

                    Hollywood is basically dead in the US and has been since the DVD player killed the movie theater.This was already starting the moviebox, as it was called in Denmark. A handy little VHS-player in a hard plastic carry case that you could rent with three movies for the price of a theater ticket. They obliterated the market for afternoon features, where you could get a ticket to last year‚Äôs James Bond movie for a third of the price.With movie boxes, you could get shitfaced or stoned or whatever, you could put it on pause an nuke a pizza. Also, you could rent porn movies and watch them at home instead of going to some sleazy cubicle affair, where they looked at you strangely if you brought your wife.RIP Blockbuster!

I‚Äôd love to tell you about Denmark but you‚Äôll have to be a bit more specific if you want a specific opinion.As to the Dutch, your average Dane doesn‚Äôt really think about them very much, except for extending them a vague sympathy, like estranged cousins.Culturally, they (the Frisians) were a Scandinavian nation and part of the Viking world until they were conquered by Charlemagne. But if not for the language, the Dutch would be the people who resembled Danes the most, largely due to how similar our countries are.

            Tv for boomers, yes get rid of it.
Young people‚Äôs addictions are Netflix, porn, weed, and rap music.

        An example of this kind of agitation is somebody recently painted a Pepe the Frog on a Bernie Sanders mural.  Plenty of gasping and sputtering resulted, including the ADL declaring Pepe as an anti semitic symbol.  On Fox News they showed a photo of it, but even blurred out Pepe, as if it‚Äôs a pornographic image. It‚Äôs funny to see the news anchors get all solemn and concerned about these kinds of pranks.

            It is hilarious how they won‚Äôt even show you the subject of the story.  I see this all the time in news articles.  Someone said something offensive, but they won‚Äôt tell you what it was.  For example, the horse trainer who was banned from the sport for giving one of his horses a ‚Äúracist‚Äù name.  I had to go through five different articles before some brave writer revealed the name was ‚ÄúGrape Soda.‚Äù

                But did he dope the horse with cough syrup mixed with grape soda? I could see that getting him banned from the profession.
But unless he named the horse Trayvon‚Äôs Purple Drank, getting banned for naming it Grape Soda is pretty sketchy. But of course, it was indeed seen as an oblique way of saying just that. Touchy, touchy.

        It‚Äôs not meme-worthy, but my recent mantra has been: Showing up in Charlotesville didn‚Äôt scare our rulers (Hell, they used it to their advantage). Not showing up in Georgia did. Ditto with all the other ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù delusional marches. The Capitol Protest will probably be called the Capitol Genocide by the end of the month.
Even though the Marie Antoinette movie is not so great, this scene beautifully encapsulates how not participating delegitimizes the enemy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FriOch58Wms

        As ugly as it looks, those troops, barricades and razor wire fencing in Washington are a great result. A ruling class living inside an armed camp is one that will eventually burn through its emotional capital and begin to make mistakes. Ideally, the ruling class stays behind those barriers, fearing that the people on the other side are ungovernable.That tableaux plays many roles. Importantly, it signals to the rest of the world the United States is a deeply troubled, dangerous empire. That is important to us because it restrains The State in its oppression. The Ruling Class does not want to receive opprobrium from the rest of the world‚Äìit is bad for business, mostly, and secondly it takes the buzz off the moral preening. The only restraint on the pending ‚ÄúDomestic Terrorism Patriot Act,‚Äù really isn‚Äôt so much concern about the reaction domestically from the White majority as it is about the perception internationally. As an aside, I think the reaction from the White majority is now being underestimated after being overestimated for years, but the State has yet to realize it.To summarize what you wrote and add a bit:*Withdraw consent and do not legitimize an illegitimate government in any way other than what it can compel by force.*Do not give anything to the State beyond what is necessary not to be arrested or killed.*Take anything you can from the State.*Humiliate the State by any means necessary other than those that will cause harm to you.*Make yourself as infrangible as possible. Small business was targeted in the last year, in no small part, because of the independence it represents. WHITE INFRANGIBILITY, if you will.The ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS OK TO BE WHITE‚Äù example is a perfect one. It shows how monstrous the State is, and it exhausts its resources. It also reveals the State‚Äôs intended end game.This will be a long struggle, but intelligent dissent can pay off handsomely.

        Whites are also conditioned to look for the big, decisive battle. The Western way of war is gathering a lot of troops for on each side and having some major battles, maybe even just one, to decide the conflict.But that doesn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre a dissident. We need to give up that idea and embrace the Eastern Way of War, which is built on guerrilla tactics and wearing out your enemy.Time to give up the fantasy of some grand uprising of deplorables. Time to stay low, throw sand in the gears when you can safely, build communities and wait for opportunities.

        The right did get mobilized,Did vote in record numbers,And Trump got a record number of votes; and the whole act was disappeared by one of the greatest feat of election fraud ever. In addition, as far as I know, not a single person has been prosecuted.To all the good people out there who say the election system need reform, I say why? If my party could cheat on a spectacular  level, and pay no consequences, while getting the result they want, there is no way in hell I would change one thing.At this particular time in history, voting, at least in the US, is meaningless.

            The important takeaway from the overt election fraud &amp; theft is that the Deep State is now all-in, and has made the 2020 election a seminal moment in our history. They know they have triggered an awakening in tens of millions of hardcore Americans and the consequences will be real &amp; tangible &amp; persistent. This means they will now play for keeps at the existential level. Nothing is off-the-table, as DC tyrants like to boast, up to and including, detention camps, gulags, and extermination facilities. That is the lesson of the 20th Century; and yes, it can happen here.

        Was it Lenin or Bakunin who said ‚ÄúThe worse, the better?‚Äù Since we‚Äôll soon enough be compelled to vote, I plan on voting for the barmiest candidate on offer ‚Äî give me a Negro trannie Maoist, please! And as for the COVID pass, I‚Äôm going to take a stand, my brothers, and I urge y‚Äôall to as well ‚Äì no vaccine until ALL the minorities, worldwide, have had theirs. And so forth. You can drag me kicking and screaming from the public bus, but in doing so, you‚Äôre arguing that it‚Äôs more important for a White Dirt Person to have his vaccine than some underprivileged etc. Dat‚Äôs rayciss!!!

            I‚Äôve long recommended guys on our side read this book. You don‚Äôt need to adopt the spirit of the enemy but you should understand his motivations and tactics, and if necessary be willing to use them.You can enter a fight with gentlemanly honor, but if your opponent brings a knife, you‚Äôll only get stabbed and bleed out a loser. If you somehow survive and find yourself in a rematch, your opponent might bring a gun this time. You and your honorable fists are dead.We need to learn from our losses. We need to understand the opposition so we can be prepared next time.

                Yes to all of this, and I would add a white pill in that there is a strategy that is well suited to succeed in this Brave New (High Tech Tyranny) World. Evolution demands that we smarter &amp; stronger in the face of a new environment with new threats. It has always been thus.

                As forEducation,there is opportunity in crisis.In NYC there are 370 schools (out of ~1100) that are closed due to CoronaVirus. Many elementary schools only have 10-20% of their students showing up each day.I know there are ‚Äúunderground Learning Pods‚Äù, because I see small groups of children entering/leaving residential buildings during the day.The school system in NYC is slowly collapsing, there is room for alternative systems to evolve.  Once there are enough of them, the time will come for parents to demand school-vouchers, and then theslowlywill becomesuddenly.

                    Still using the old mindset.  You don‚Äôt need or want vouchers/permission and $ from the government to educate White children.  Withdraw from the public school system.  Don‚Äôt employ any teacher indoctrinated with an accredited ‚Äòteaching degree.‚Äô  You need to secede emotionally and physically from the old paradigm.  If you can simultaneously damage or harm the existing government system, do so, but first build your own parallel community.

                        The current ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù has allowed the first step to evolve: namely ad hoc learning pods;these pods are not requesting ‚Äúpermission‚Äù from the State, they‚Äôre just popping up.The second step is for them to become ubiquitous and accepted.Demanding vouchers at that point is how they become completely legitimized.. which corresponds to delegitimizing the existing School System.the evolution of this new system will be.. Ignore, Tolerate, Accept, Celebrate.Vouchers are just a way station, before having each family pay the education costs directly; but before that, we need to remind them that when Society at large pays for something, Society gets a say in what gets taught. If you don‚Äôt want Society/Gubbermint upside your bidnez*, then you can‚Äôt demand they pay for it. Pick your own damn cotton, raise your own damn kids.*leaned that expression from a black co-worker long ago.upside your bidnezis sticking their nose into your affairs.

                    Quite frankly, anyone remotely concerned about the issues raised here would never farm their child out to the state. Long, long term? Who knows. Short term? Educate your children yourself.
I now have two potential converts in my circle to home schooling. One is seriously considering it, the other has began asking questions they never asked before.

                    So, these pods are becoming one-room schoolhouses, like my mother went to. If a neighborhood house can be a nursery, it could be a school as well- and our ladies‚Äô best skills would blossom with it. The childless, eager to associate with other women, would relieve the mothers‚Äô burden, as kids are quite a trial.These pods should be encouraged. Maybe they‚Äôll get the support that the showoff bimbos running Drag Queen Story Hour get, someday.Not likely in the near future, as the media has ignored the million March For Life in DC for 20 years‚Äì but still, we‚Äôve got to give our girls something better than OnlyFans Cougar Edition.Side thought- are any churches doing this?  Can a model be sold through the church branches, as that‚Äôs how they quietly do things?

                It MUST start with keeping your children away from these things as much as humanly possible, at least until they do not believe in Santa anymore.The amount of propaganda children are bombarded with while still young enough to believe in Santa is absolutely amazing.  Instead of plopping them in front of a media device, read an old book to them.  Absolutely no daycare. Homeschool if at all possible.There is a reason anyone who is educated to work with or around children are the most mal-educated people.  Just look at state license requirements and college class requirements for anything even remotely involving children.

                    The GF and I are planning on children within the next few years. We are definitely considering home-schooling as pretty much our only option.
Would still like a community of likeminded people to raise a family within. This unfortunately seems like a difficult task.

                        We old fogies need to get involved again in promoting groups.I had a friend, she and her husband started something called ‚ÄúFresno Friends‚Äù, for couples and seekers who wanted Saturday nights without the bar-hopping.  It became quite a success, even getting sponsorships such as ‚ÄúPringles Night‚Äù, dances and local bands, a sort of square dance or swing band circuit.  I know this can be done.  Prepper groups, even better.Thanks, folks, I need to reorient my goals back to getting in the networking game.  We need replicable models to promote, and experiments to try.  People are dying for fun and friends, that‚Äôs always been hard to do.

                            Pringles night sounds like fun, thanks for the ideas.
We were seriously attempting to form some group through various means right before Covid shut everything down. We‚Äôre going to try renew our efforts as Spring approaches.
I really hope the new administration doesn‚Äôt find a way to shut everything down again.

                Hollywood? I can make my own movies now and spend my time on youtube. if you educate your kids on values before they get to school it will be hard for them to brainwash them. social media is not safe from change, when is the last time you went on myspace? they are not immortal.  The weasels always think they can change A and B and C will just stay the same. C is now awake.

                    We indoctrinated our kids good and hard.  They get pissed if their school shoves liberal crap in their faces.  We have really good public schools, so we put up with some things.  But the kids got a great vaccine for diversity when they had to deal with some inner city kids that were bussed in.

            The main reason it doesn‚Äôt work for us is that we have nothing moral with which to shame the Leftists.  Used to be that ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù was the moral framework so you could get a little mileage out of calling them godless heathens but now, godless heathenism is the norm and they have no moral compunction.  So we have no lever to move them the way they do us.  The own public morality now.

                    not according to Hoffer; in his thesis they are hyper aware of their own inferiority, and seek total negation of their individuality to escape the unrelenting shame they feel every minute of every day.  if he is right, trying to shame them more only reinforces their sense of immense personal failure (driving them further into the mass movement)

                        We stopped bullying nerds, they went mainstream, and now they rule over us. Once their marginalization is reestablished things will work themselves out.Obviously that‚Äôs the long game, meant to consolidate gains in the culture war. Just one tactic in whatever larger strategy.And for the record, being part nerd myself, I don‚Äôt have any particular animus against them. It‚Äôs just that they aren‚Äôt fit to run society. There‚Äôs a certain kind of emotional/social intelligence they lack, which, causing difficulties navigating life in society individually, might explain the collectivist impulse.Also, I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs not shame but anger driving them. Hence not withdrawing but seeking to dominate and humiliate those they feel inferior to.  Revenge of the Nerds.Sorry for the essay!

                In the past I have suggested adopting a virulent pro-life stance as part of the platform mostly due to its emotional potential but it is also demographically practical (for us.) The regime seems to have enjoyed great success instilling emotional fervor in its followers by characterizing its opponents as nazis. I think we could enjoy the same benefit characterizing them as baby killers. I want it to be one of the first words that come to mind when they think of the regime and its supporters. It also has the virtue of being accurate.

                        My last day reading NR was when Derb was purged. Just pointing out how effective a moral and political motivator it is. Even in the face of everything the regime has invested in abortion there are a bunch of states where it is restricted and curtailed. Reading the abortion advocacy material on these states is like a mirror of 2nd amendment proponents complaints about states where that right is trampled. I don‚Äôt care if they take pride in killing babies. I care about finding effective means of eroding the power of those who would destroy us. This issue has a proven track record of motivating effective opposition.

                        I think tashtego is correct.  We need moral arguments.But more than arguments, we need moral media.  So much of our alleged morality comes from movies and the media. That‚Äôs why so much of what is called news is actually in the form of a narrative.   As long as they control the narrative, they get to reframe being pro-life into hating women.  They do this through popular culture and the press.

                We‚Äôre not trying to change the mind of most whites, just a few. We don‚Äôt need 90% of whites. We need 10% or 20%.
For them, use their sense of fairness to break them from the system:
Why is moral to discriminate against whites and whites only?
Civil Rights for Whites!
Btw, I‚Äôm not saying to use such slogans to actually try and change the system. I‚Äôm saying use them to change a few minds. I couldn‚Äôt care less if Progressives believe those slogans or not. These are just tactics to win small battles.

                So we have no lever to move them the way they do us.
Sure we do. It‚Äôs called violence and in 2020 it became a legitimate form of political expression. If your idea of a lever is another 45000 word blog post or a podcast, you‚Äôre right, that won‚Äôt budge them.

                        Weirdly enough I have to use violence to save my bacon about every six months: the last incident involved a Great Dane that tried to bite a member of my family. Gave it a concussion with a front kick. After about a dozen incidents like that with two and four-legged beasts I‚Äôve decided that violence is a part of life and no big deal. You just have to be smart: don‚Äôt get angry, don‚Äôt try to talk to the other party (you‚Äôll just say something actionable), don‚Äôt report it to the police, and just get on with your life.

                            Splitting hairs, but anger is fine as long as you can control it. And to point out the obvious, it‚Äôs also masculine. We were literally made to fight.  Imo the world is so screwed up in no small part because of men not getting angry.  Losing your head is what gets you in trouble.

                    You have to be careful with that approach since it can attract the po po. We can achieve more with a box of roofing nails accidentally falling out a truck in a well known super zip code area and making life miserable for the Lefties living there. Think Malibu or some East coast watering hole like the Hamptons.Or if you got the balls take a bus load of homeless people into said neighborhood and tell them the people living there will give them money and booze, And as they leave the bus give each one a bottle of Night Train or Cisco to jack them up.Or put up flyers around town saying there will be a White Power meeting at a well known lefty community center or some such, SJW‚Äôs will swarm the place and demand scalps.

                I don‚Äôt know, I think the racial aspect of all their claims gives us a morality that they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt let us have.¬†Everything coming out of the system right now is all about being anti-white and they‚Äôre largely not even bothering with ideological pretenses which themselves are code for anti-white.
When an liberal acquaintance asked how I could think like that (I don‚Äôt recall what it was in regards to) I said that I just didn‚Äôt want my people to be a persecuted minority.¬†I never got a response.

                We have real morality up the wazoo.


They‚Äôve reverted to tribalism- morality only for their own. This is the norm, so we should indulge it.


I‚Äôll follow Boy Scout Law with my own and my customers who deserve it‚Äì and get everything I can from the rest.


For fun, when bums approach (at a run en masse, in my case)- I ask them for money first. Hilarity enues!

                We can shame them for their anti-white racism. For Leftists, racism is worse then murder. Imposing their own  Great Sin upon themselves would harm them psychologically, which is one reason they have reacted so violently to the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK to be white‚Äù meme. That trope strongly implies that anti-white racism is a real phenomenon, which, of course, it is.
I think the greatest tactical and possibly ideological failing of the American right was the refusal to condemn Leftist for their anti-white racism. Even Trump failed to do this.

                    When you‚Äôre accusing them of being a bigot, ditch the white and replace it with anti-European. You must get them to connect their bigotry with people.You will NEVER shame them for saying kill whites etc.  To them, white is not a people, it is a political invention and an abstraction.  They just do not view white in a way that connects with them to actual real life people. But there is no fake and gay definition for European.  A European is most certainly a person and not some political abstraction.

            The problem is that the Left has changed the rules now that they are in power. With the exception of a handful of truly violent groups like the Black Panthers and the Weathermen, the old ‚Äúliberal‚Äù Establishment pretty much allowed the Left of the Sixties to engage in continuous challenges to the system ‚Äî disrupting college classes, disrupting lectures, demonstrations, leafleting, picketing, etc. Over time, this evolved into a permanent subculture, and became the modus operandi of feminists, blacks, illegal immigrants, and gays. If the perpetrators got charged with anything at all, it wasn‚Äôt much more than ‚Äúdisorderly conduct‚Äù and the charges were immediately dropped in court.Now that the Left is the New Establishment, and controls the national security state and the state surveillance apparatus, they are not going to treat dissidents on the Right with kid gloves like the Old Establishment treated them. If you were to paste leaflets for the International Socialists calling for for the overthrow of capitalism on any college campus, bus station, or utility pole in a blue city, nobody would so much as bat an eye. Try pasting an ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK to be White‚Äù flyer and see how fast the local police, the state police, and the FBI get on the case, review every frame of surveillance cam footage, track your cell phone GPS coordinates, your DNA, and your fingerprints, and try to get you thrown in prison for 20 years for hate crimes. Try storming and interrupting a lecture given by a left-wing tranny or a black on campus and see just how fast you end up doing actual hard time or bankrupted by legal defense fees.Beyond that, any arrest, no matter how bogus, even if you are acquitted or the charges are ACD, can bar you from employment and in some cases from owning a gun. I live in a very blue state where so ANY arrest, no matter how minor, can get your guns confiscated before a court appearance or a conviction.The way that TPTB went after the Capitol crowd, even the LARPers and doofuses like the ‚ÄúBuffalo Horn shaman‚Äù (who is being held without bail) after dropping the charges against thousands of blacks and Antifa this summer, is a harbinger of how bad they are  going to fuck us over and how blatant the double standard will be.

                For all intents we now live in a police state so act accordingly.This is why we need to be careful what we do. You want to be subversive and put out flyers? Well don‚Äôt carry a cell phone, wear gloves and a hoody, and don‚Äôt do it in your neighborhood. Park a good 3 blocks away or more.BTW if your car has On-Star or something like or Wifi connectivity. Your car is being tracked 7√ó24, so don‚Äôt use it for meet ups or anything that is subversive. This goes doubly for rentals that have tracking built in.Get a older car that doesn‚Äôt have the connectivity.or bicycle.If you are making up subversive literature and flyers, use a stand alone pc or Raspberry PI and printer. Handle all paper with latex gloves. You tell no one about what you do.Keep all files on a memory stick hidden away when not in use.

        I can attest to where my ‚Äúway forward‚Äù has already been underway for a while.Call it addition by subtraction. What do sportsballers, politicians, and Hollywood ‚Äústars‚Äù all have in common? They NEED ‚Äì as in a narcissist‚Äôs fuel ‚Äì NEED our eyeballs. Whether it be singing out our appreciation of their heroic efforts, or shaking our fists in the air.No consuming sportsball, the kabuki theater of TV or other forms of political theater. That includes pundits, yakkers, all of them. No consuming Hollywood product, from theaters to their streaming. No social media.Just the other night I was making an assessment of what the results have been in my life, one life, of the above choices. They are manifold, and evident. Less stress, more productivity. Better relationships in person.Bonding in real life. Building and fixing things. Creating things. To be continued.

        ‚ÄúThis has a strategic value, as well. The Left has always looked at the Republicans, along with their enablers from Conservative Inc., as an electric fence that keeps the white majority inside the system.‚Äù‚Äì So much damage has been done because of these people.  Human sedatives like Rush Limbaugh (who literally had an addiction to sedatives).  So much time has been wasted.  In my case I started questioning the lies around 2000 and was off the reservation by 2005.  I won‚Äôt use the term ‚Äúboomer‚Äù but according to legend old people are supposed to weed this stuff out from ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù and ‚Äúlife experience‚Äù and give ‚Äúgood advice‚Äù to the young people.  Yet I sit here in my 40s completely disappointed that I had to learn every valuable truth in politics, and some other things, from scratch.

        A few thoughts after yesterday‚Äôs, and the last 10 months‚Äô happenings.#1: Consider much more carefully what you donate to.  In the past, my first donation priority would have been to my kids‚Äô Catholic School.  Going forward, if I donate excess to it, it would be for a scholarship which I have control over and can ensure it goes to a white kid in need, not some token jogger or beaner.  Help get a white kid out of a completely pozzed, dangerous public school and given him/her a better future.  Also, over the past 10 months, the most courageous organization I have seen in my area has been the youth hockey association.  They have done everything possible, bend the rules, whatever, to get and keep the kids on the ice through all this COVID tyranny.  Further, it is almost entirely white kids (a few push-starts in the mix), so you know any extra donation is benefitting almost entirely white kids.  And while there are probably a few ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù parents mixed in, at least you know if they are letting their kid play hockey in all this, they are not full-bore Covidians.#2: Infiltrate and push the left over the edge and into fighting.  For example, get into a conversation about the new tranny health secretary, but complain that it got the job just because it is a tranny when there are many well-qualified blacks out there.  Connect with liberals and begin calling on Google, Facebook, Amazon to appoint POC executives and board members, especially blacks.

                What‚Äôs scary is that Portland is now trying to export its‚Äúgood ideas‚Äù to my area. I just got the invite (because I have infiltrated the leftwing grifter industrial complex):I would like to invite you to the Dignity Village Town Hall hosted by the¬†Zanesville Think Tank on Poverty on Wednesday, January 27 at 6pm.Dignity Villageis a membership-based¬†community in NE Portland, providing shelter off the street for 60 people a night since 2000. It‚Äôs democratically self-governed with a mission to provide transitional housing that fosters community and self-empowerment ‚Äì a radical experiment to end homelessness.Next Wednesday, the Zanesville Think Tank on Poverty will host residents from the village to discuss how the community came into being, their successes, challenges and how this project could be replicated in other places. The meeting is open to all to attend ‚Äì you do not have to be part of the Zanesville Think Tank.Can you imagine how insane you have to be to take Portland‚Äôs advice on  how to handle the homeless? Their policies have caused them to have among the largest populations of homeless in the nation.Either their policies fail to solve homelessness and/or they attract the homeless. Why would any sane city want either?

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been doing this for 20 years and Portland‚Äôs homelessness problem is worse than ever. Zanesville‚Äôs police chief said in 2019: ‚ÄòThe more services you provide for the homeless, the more homeless you will attract.‚Äô Replicating your model in Zanesville thus seems likely to attract even more homeless. That is not a benefit to the productive citizens of Zanesville who want a safe, clean city to live in.‚Äù

Zanesville is a small, very conservative city in a very red county. These wreckers are in every community making everyone else pay for their bleeding hearts.
That‚Äôs one of the most eye-opening things I‚Äôve learned from my infiltration of the Grifter Industrial Complex ‚Äî it‚Äôs everywhere and it never stops. For every bad lefty idea, there‚Äôs some damn leftist in your community trying to get donations and grants to make it happen.

        If you really want to throw some sand in the gears, get off the W-2 labor system.  Make them come after the money they want to take from you and your family‚Äôs labor.

        My neighbor and I have taken down our American flags. In my case, because It could be an identifier of a Trump voter.

            I‚Äôve been telling friends and neighbors that Ipurposelywon‚Äôt be voting anymore. Each one of them is a little shocked and ask why, sometimes laughing a bit (usually uncomfortably).I simply tell them that I no longer believe in the system and not just because of the election. I tell them one party hates me and the other party doesn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm no longer wanted or represented in the government so why should I vote, which is a sign of legitimacy.I‚Äôve be pleasantly surprised by their faces. They seem genuinely shaken up by my decision, which, like I said, caught me a bit off guard.

                It represents the roots of an America that is dead and gone.  There is no going back.  No constitution or historical fervor will save you.  We need a new model to move forward.  Whatever else it may be, it needs to beWhite, and that isnotsynonymous with American.

            If you want to cover your tracks, I suggest chipping in $10 or $20 dollars to the worst local democrat and voting in a couple of democrat primaries. Both are public record and can be used as a shield if anyone accuses you of wrong think. Future elections will be more about establishing loyalties. We may even see voter participation climb among Whites in the rush to avoid persecution. Best case scenario: the worst guy gets in and the voters get what they deserve while you skate on wrongthink charges.I‚Äôve been predicting the dissolution of the republican party once the democrats achieve permanent majority status. I expect more people to leave the party for fear of persecution. In the future, there may be an exodus to the democrats by ex-republicans for protection purposes ‚Äî don‚Äôt want to be on the wrong side of the new boss, do you? In fact, you could argue that has already happened in Virginia and Georgia. In the latter case, White suburbanites have switched dem now that Georgia‚Äôs demographics have changed to the point where the GOP is caput in that state and association with it is a liability. Ditto California‚Äôs ex-republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and most of NeverTrump, which was mostly an operation to get back into the good graces of the new boss by denouncing the old boss.

                    Peckerwood is slang for whites who are not ashamed of their race and will fight to the death to avoid rape or robbery from negroes. It originated in prison, but it is used elsewhere in hard core redneck areas. The negroes actually came up with name because woodpeckers have red necks. Whites decided to own what was intended as an insult.Not all peckerwoods are AB members, they are just badass white guys who are proud of who they are and don‚Äôt take shit from negroes.It‚Äôs a fairly common term in rural Oklahoma, even outside of prison. It‚Äôs not usual for a man to greet another man by asking, What‚Äôs up, Wood?‚Äù

            Dear Mr. Lee,
I respectfully disagree with you taking your flag down.
The US flag is a powerful symbol.  Why give it to those who hate you? To those who would burn it on national television?
If the flag was fine during the dark times of the Bad Orange Man tyranny, it is even better now under our glorious new Papa Biden.
My church hides gays &amp; pederasts and has a communist as the vicar of Christ on earth.But I don‚Äôt take down my cross.The symbol is more powerful than the men behind it.

                Strongly disagree.  The symbol is for a nation that is dead and gone.  It will not be resurrected.  We cannot build a White future by relying on old-style patriotism and muh magic constitution.  We need new symbols.  Go back and read today‚Äôs post again.  And again.  And again.

                    ‚ÄúThe symbol is for a nation that is dead and gone.

Build community where you are.The Constitution is long gone. For THEM, the ends justify the means. By any means possible. That‚Äôs what new-action Commies do. THEY lie-cheat-steal and make up the rules as they go along. There is no Rule of Law.

Muh Constitution!Don‚Äôt be such hypnotized dumbshits! It‚Äôs gone.Be patient! Be still! Now is not the time. Universal Law: The walls of the old structure must come down. The form of the new structure is not visible yet. Only after the old is down, then can the new structure be designed and assembled. Right now, you don‚Äôt know what variables to build with as the variables will change. Put your energy toward ‚Äúcommunity.‚Äù You will know when the time to build anew is right. ‚ÄúTo every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under Heaven.‚Äù Know that and be patient. You will know‚Ä¶..unless you‚Äôre too busy spinning in circles making mindless yapping noise infighting. Which only serves Their purpose. Be still. Gather your food and your friends. You will recognize the shift in reality and when it is time to build.

                    All those talking about adopting symbols. Make it something meaningful to your people.

        The biggest, most obvious demonstration of our system‚Äôs bankruptcy is to point out to people one of Sailer‚Äôs best ideas ‚Äì total fertility. If an economic and cultural system is functional, it provides the economic  structure to enable affordable family formation and the moral legitimacy for people believe it is right or have children. On both accounts, our present society is massively failing.We are experiencing a total fertility collapse. Particularly among the most liberal elements in our population. I‚Äôm a millennial and it‚Äôs rather clear from social media that many of my peers are neglecting parenthood. And those who are having kids tend to be more conservative.Every single time it is possible, point this out to people. A society that has no children has no future and liberalism has led us to massive infertility.

            So I non-concur on this approach. It‚Äôs all logically sound ‚Ä¶ I completely agree with the conclusions. But logical arguments will not work on these people. It‚Äôs like arguing Protestant theology in a convent; no matter how good your argument might be, the audience is not going to listen when their identify is built on not-listening.Instead, I mock them. My mom‚Äôs Presbyterian church has gone down the SJW path, with the predictable result being everyone with children has left and the average congregant‚Äôs age is now well over 50. This particular church features a main building dated to the early 1800s. Instead of making a logical argument about birth-rates, I quipped to the SJW/closeted homosexual minister that his church is really a hospice and his prized historical sanctuary will in a few years make for some nice condos.

        I personally like pasting around town the following 8/12 x 11 poster with the meme ‚ÄúEverything You See Was Built By Men Supporting Their Families‚Äù
But that‚Äôs just grenade tossing. It may be fun but takes a VERY long time to have an lasting effect much like the long march through the institutions of the left. What we need is either 1. targeted elimination (picking them off systematically one by one) so they get the Fear of God instilled in their Satanic bowels or 2. Nuke the whole shebang in a figurative sense.

        If you haven‚Äôt started to get healthy yet, begin today. If you‚Äôre continuing on the journey to health, keep going. Turn off the computer, put down your phone, and go outside for a walk. Enjoy Nature as she is the final arbiter.The greatest poke in the eye to progs is strength, health, and a life well lived outside of the garbage pit our culture has become. These blue-haired pasty maniacs are so angry because they are unhappy.As Zman says frequently, ‚Äòlife is for living‚Äô!

        Education levels the playing field in the war against the new tech tyranny. Get smarter.Going Dark (Cont)Big Brother uses phone data in many nefarious ways, and one of these is ‚Äúevent‚Äù canvassing. Most 911 calls now trigger an Israeli-developed surveillance program that geolocates the event origin, pings &amp; geolocates all smart phones in the vicinity, initiates tracking, and in some cases activates audio/video feeds from each phone. Depending on the ‚Äúevent‚Äù, dossiers on all owners can be summoned, and suspicious phone movements can also trigger immediate pursuit &amp; apprehension.

            And there will be more discomfort to come. Diversity and Inclusion seminars forever. Refugee resettlements in your area. Blacks getting free houses down the street. News of people just like you getting fired and blackballed from ever working again because they got caught saying the wrong word. Etc. Etc.It‚Äôs coming ‚Äì and faster than I would have thought. Colorblind CivNats can no longer hide. They are being forced to either grovel forever or begin thinking of how to resist. Sadly, many (hell, most) will choose to grovel, though like a drug addict the other side will demand higher and higher levels self flagellation from Normies. But some will be forced to wake up.

                        And realistically white flight has never stopped anything and never will. One day Soros will dump 10 million on a pro-crime DA or Sheriff (or Dominion gets a new code) and suddenly crime is legalized. Then they bring in 50,000 Somalians. What are you going to do?
There is one idea, but so far nobody has resorted to it.
Barring a shift to that mentality, I‚Äôm living in a diverse shithole because, as Z says, might as well live in the future (realistically it‚Äôs the present).

                                    That‚Äôs one of the problems of small town (formerly) America, and has been for a few decades.  Kids grow up and move away to the cities for better opportunities and most of what‚Äôs left are the geezers.  Many of the young ones who stay are of a tradesman bent and like to work with their hands.

        Excellent column, and perhaps the most overtly radical thing Z has written.
Regarding the matter of choice in the marketplace‚Äìspecifically the corporate marketplace‚Äìboycotting is almost impossible because virtually every corporation is part of the Power Structure.  You may refuse to buy Nikes, but you can be sure that the corporate culture of Addidas is every bet as anti-white, although perhaps less visible.
PS‚ÄìNice to see Z using ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúwe.‚Äù Welcome to the party, mate!

        Weaking the regime is a solution though, no matter how temporary. In fact, it always was. There was always a sweet spot between optics cucking, boog fedposting and honeytrap falling-into, and endless sterile isolated prepping and memeing. Flyers always were effective, for example. Even better with the faces of our increasing martyrs, provided we don‚Äôt all go out at the same time.
May the Divine Assistance be always with us, specially in this coming struggle. And may the souls of our faithfully departed, like Cannon Hinnant and Ashli Babbit, rest in peace and inspire us further

        Helpful ‚ÄúWe‚Äù tips:If you drink more than 10 days out of a month, february is a good month to not drink‚Ä¶ the whole month, no excuses.  After successfully completing your month, spend 60 minutes aside to assess the role alcohol has in your life.
If you drink more than 20 days out of a month, reverse the above order.

        This post really hyped me up!One of the benefits with a Biden presidency is now we can act as we truly are: dissidents, a minority with our backs against the ropes and a mighty struggle before us.Its hard to not think of solutions during a struggle, but sometimes you need to concentrate on just one punch at a time. When you‚Äôre exhausted and facing a fierce opponent, you can‚Äôt get ahead of yourself‚Äìits best to remain calm and reduce each moment to the basics. If you are gassed out during a race, you concentrate on form, and breathing; you break down the remaining distance into segments (‚Äúonly 4 more 200m strides, I got this!‚Äù)I agree, we can‚Äôt get ahead of ourselves. We have to regain composure and hone our concentration.

        The problem with ‚Äòpoking the bear‚Äô with ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Okay to be White‚Äù signs and other pranks is the ruling class has the ability to destroy a person‚Äôs life and we do not have the resources or networking to ensure people doing this get good lawyers and money for when they inevitably lose their jobs and face jail.Literal terrorists in the left get a cushy job in Academia.  Until we can get organization enough to ensure that whatever the powers that be throw at a person, their livelihood and family will be intact, making the ruling class‚Äôs threats ineffectual, it will just increase the fear from the right and the anti-white programs from the left.Running for the hills and regrouping, as unsexy as it sounds, is the name of the game now.  Guerrilla warfare comes later.

            If I wore a ‚ÄúI love Stalin‚Äù shirt to work, no one would dare say anything to me. But if I rolled in with a MAGA hat, I would face financial ruin. That‚Äôs real power, and as much as I hate it, we would do well to respect it. We should be under no delusions of the scope of Lefty‚Äôs Will to Power.

                Agreed.
If MAGA guy got fired, and the right hired a battalion of lawyers to go after the company while MAGA guy got six figures in crowdfunding for his troubles, we‚Äôre entering a new game.

            i have given this some thought.  the thing that would work ‚Äî and be safe ‚Äî is to join a prog group, then go into various neighborhoods putting up things saying how the white progs favor another group over the group in the neighborhood ‚Äî because the other group are ‚Äúbetter people‚Äù.  if you get caught, why you are just an overzealous cadre.   try and create paranoia between the various factions of the prog coalition.

                    already very upscale beach cities like Santa Monica and Beverly Hills have gangs of nogs swooping in for raids on the stores there.  won‚Äôt be long before the nogs go into the residential neighborhoods.

So many natural hostilities to exploit among groups that have only been encouraged their whole lives to nurture their sense of entitlement.

Pushing for health labels and country of origin tags on EVERYTHING, like they do with foods now.
Create a culture and mindset where people start demanding their foods be locally sourced

        Serious question
but wouldn‚Äôt our constant opposition to the system constitute for us a negative identity?
Which is why I say, sure, throw some sand in the gears when you can, but don‚Äôt let it consume you. Drop out and do your own thing, and people WILL follow ‚Äî if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important to you. That‚Äôs my game plan, anyway. I am not going to let these people ruin my life and dictate to me what i can and can‚Äôt do. They‚Äôre not worth it.

        This reminds me of back in the 1990‚Äôs, when I first got involved with Dr. Pierce‚Äôs National Alliance. The NatVan book store sold these ‚ÄúEarth‚Äôs Most Endangered Species: The White Race‚Äù stickers, other stickers, and various downloadable fliers. I would prowl around in the dead of night, affixing these things on objects in high pedestrian traffic areas where they would be sure to be seen the next day. What fun! The local news media would have fits! From the way they carried on, you‚Äôd think a million Nazi storm troopers, joined by a legion of Klansmen, were on the march, when in fact, it was only one guy slinking around in the dark. Did I win any hearts and minds in those days? Probably not. However, perhaps our people will be more receptive nowadays. I believed back then, and more so now, that political ‚Äúmonkey wrenching‚Äù is the way forward for our people.

        ‚ÄòBread and Circuses‚Äô is the cancer of democracy, the fatal disease for which there is no cure. Democracy often works beautifully at first. But once a state extends the franchise to every warm body, be he producer or parasite, that day marks the beginning of the end of the state. For when the plebs discover that they can vote themselves bread and circuses without limit and that the productive members of the body politic cannot stop them, they will do so, until the state bleeds to death, or in its weakened condition the state succumbs to an invader‚Äîthe barbarians enter Rome.‚Äù ‚Äì Robert A.

        In 1968/1969 a border dispute between the CCP and the CCCP turned hot, and I have seen opinions that it nearly went nuclear.   my understanding is the US said to russia, if you nuke bejing, we will respond in kind.  in other words, the chins had slipped the leash and have never looked back.   even in vietnam, i believe the two major commie powers supported different factions (the russian faction in the north won).this has implications for the relationship between the progs here, and the chin leadership.   my sense is that the progs are going to turn on the chins, and hard.  just another case of be careful of what you wish for.

                There‚Äôs a theory that revolutions happen when enough people realize that by rolling the dice on where they end up in the new society, they‚Äôve got a damn good chance of doing better.  If you‚Äôre near the bottom, say bottom 5%, you‚Äôve got a 95% chance of being higher up the totem pole assuming it‚Äôs just a random free for all and there‚Äôs a not-insignificant chance that you could end up near the top.  Going by this thinking, our task might be as simple as getting enough people thinking ‚ÄúI can do better than this‚Äù.

                Exactly. Everyone wants these grand plans and a very defined outcome. But that‚Äôs not the game that we‚Äôre playing.
We know the general direction that we want to go. That‚Äôs good enough for now. As to tactics, don‚Äôt get caught up in big moves. Try a bunch of small moves, see which ones work and keep using them. Shelf the ones that don‚Äôt work.
We‚Äôre in for a long, slow grind, not some epic one-time battle.

                Stop looking backwards and setting the bar so low.  The roots of today‚Äôs clownworld were sown long before the 1950s and began to yield poisoned fruit even then.

                        So did the Declaration of Independence, the fake Enlightenment, and the religion of Jesus. We reside in a dank, dark dungeon, and we won‚Äôt depart it by clinging to old habits of thought and to the old ideas about existence. This means that we must summon the will to do ourselves the hard work of ontology which our professional philosophers have largely avoided for centuries.

                                Ontology begins with questions. Here‚Äôs a bundle of examples with a segue into ethics at the end:(1) Is materialism true?(2.1) Is there a creative deity, like the one alleged in Bereshit 1, where we are told to believe ina rakia that never was?(2.2) Are both materialism and theism false??(3) Ispresentismtrue? Or does reality work more likeperdurantismorfour-dimensionalism?(4) What are right ways to live if materialism is uncertain, if the Creator hypothesis is uneducated, and if physical reality is a great unity of moments past, present, and future?

                                Here are a few more questions:
Is there a common law of existence which was never made or created, is subject to no willpower, and cannot be altered or abolished? If so, is it really prudent to allow the teaching of theism (a cult of willpower) to the young? Is it prudent to delay rigorous education in the one law of exisence until one is nearly 20 years old and polluted with humanism, democracy, and populist republicanism?

                            I would argue the true cause of our situation is wealth. Once the West, and then America, became rich they had the leisure to indulge in nonsense like feminism, DIE, trannies, etc. The nonsense is always there, beneath the surface of every human culture, but when people have to concentrate on survival they don‚Äôt have time to indulge in fantasy.We need the US Empire, and all its constituent empires, to collapse. Then we‚Äôll be back to surviving and the nutjobs will be dead or exiled. Maybe this will be the time we finally learn enough to arrest any future growth in wealth and power before it turns future whites back into fools, but history says we won‚Äôt.

                                I would like to see wealth repurposed rather than send everyone back to subsistence living.  After all it was that from which came the desire for modern wealth.  It isn‚Äôt necessary that wealth and technology be turned to producing distractions, drugs, and political fantasies (i.e feminism, DIE, etc‚Ä¶) to keep the masses asleep.Western civilization was on course, as recently as the 1960s, to reach the stars, extend human lifespan, and expand understanding and knowledge as far beyond our level as we are beyond the ancients.  Then, gradually at first, that hopeful and expansive vision was shelved in favor of cheap thrills, sexual degeneracy, mass marketed political fantasies, and simple minded consumerism (my flatscreen is bigger than yours!).Economic thinking bifurcated into two simplistic doctrines; on the one hand that the goal of an economy was ‚Äúequality‚Äù (essentially the communist/socialist view) or ‚Äúfree markets‚Äù, which implied dissolution of national borders, destruction of autonomous cultures, and a worship of efficiency. Ultimately this translated into a system that undermined the value of labor and caused wealth to flow upwards into fewer and fewer hands.I‚Äôm was planning a comment on the ‚Äú1950s‚Äù thread above along somewhat parallel lines.  To wit, rolling things back to some arbitrary prior point runs a large risk of getting us right back here.  On top of that, a lot of the suggested reset points required now impossible pre-conditions.  Let‚Äôs see, the 1950s eh?  Well, the first thing we need to do is convince the Russians to re-invent the Soviet Union so we can have a big, convincing threat to unite against‚Ä¶I‚Äôm no fan of Marx but a lot of his ideas were adapted from Hegel and we shouldn‚Äôt poison that well.  Hegel‚Äôs main idea was the notion of history working itself out through thesis, antithesis, and ultimate synthesis in which the two are resolved into a new thing.  We desperately need to combine the West‚Äôs pursuit of knowledge and wealth with older understandings about human nature, and the imperfectability of society and human nature.  Just because ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù have conflated dudes-in-drag with advances in physics doesn‚Äôt mean we should.

                                    Time will tell, but I‚Äôm not sure just moving the wealth around will work. I suspect it‚Äôs a fundamental part of human psychology that when we have too much we go nuts.I also believe the breakpoint in Western civilization came earlier. It was no later than when women were given the vote. That was a suicidal mistake.

                                What would be smart is making a list of the white folks at the forefront of the insanity. And once the collapse happens, make sure that they can never cause such damage again.
Also, we‚Äôve sure gotten a (((helping hand))). That would be important to consider going forward.
Not all white people go crazy in wealth.

                                    I heartily agree with the list. In the case of those who‚Äôve made it a family tradition to destroy the West, it may be wise to expand the list beyond those family members directly responsible.The ((())) will continue to be a problem, not only due to their own efforts, but because even if there‚Äôs a Whiteopia in the future there will be many whites who worship the parasitic tribe and insist they be included. Inevitably, if one portion of Whiteopia excludes Them, some other whites will (with encouragement) screech NAHTZEEEEEES and demand war against them.

            You raise a good question; if the tactics Z-man suggests succeed, the managerial class may simply decide that the deplorables are indeed ungovernable and concede significant autonomy to certain communities or even regions.  Just pay the tribute and we‚Äôll leave you alone.  Those areas may eventually become their own countries as central authority breaks down.

                        I think you are giving them too much credit.
For the idoits in the general population, I think it is virtue signaling without any thought about the consequences of the success of causes they support.
For the politicians, it is likely just a business transaction.  If they can rake in some serious cash, they will support the cause.

                        I really think that this cannot be emphasized enough. It must be those few people who are reachable and decent. No matter for county boundaries, employment record and perhaps even criminal record. Do they have the same opinions? The same concerns? The same race?
Indeed, if I were to consider those within the boundaries of my town of birth ‚ÄòMy People‚Äô, we‚Äôd be talking 50% mystery meat and jogger at a minimum. You‚Äôre correct. If America, and by extension The Isles, are dead, then their mechanisms and entities should not be entertained as meaningful.

                        You get it, partly. Focus on people and territory, for each is utterly necessary. Yet there must be more than these. They don‚Äôt speak deeply enough to the human condition, esp. about the great questions of existence. A coherent, defensible worldview is necessary, and it must be teachable, at least in broad outline, by parents and elders to childen and the young. People who believe together breed together.

                                If you believe in an omnipotent god who exists necessarily, it would be a good idea to think through this theology to an obvious implication. The law of existence is in charge of the god, and the god is the prisoner of the law.
Now, we can know that a law of existence holds us as its captives even if there is no such being as a god, but we can demonstate the existence of immutable law quite easliy. Take, as examples, the impossiblity of nihilism and the impossibility of expressing ‚àö2 as a ratio of two integers.

                                    If God is imprisoned by law, he is not omnipotent. But what is a law of existence? Existence simply is. However, there may be laws in an extant reality that place limits on the possible. There may also be divine laws which place bounds on what is acceptable behavior and what is not.
As far as nihilism goes, not only is it possible, it is very real. Most postmodern philosophers, for instance, propound nihilism. Now whether or not nihilism is remotely workable when put into practice is another question. And we may soon find out the answer.

            It‚Äôs a mistake to talk about the end game.  Your critics can endlessly criticize your end state. After all, your end state doesn‚Äôt exist and so people are free to endlessly speculate all the ways in which your end state sucks.  Invariably, whenever I am watching a pro-white argue with an anti-white, the conversation goes into a ditch talking about what do about based black man in the ethnostate and what we‚Äôre going to do with all those Walter Williamses and Thomas Sowels.
Just drive up the cost of the status quo.

                Not to mention there are far fewer Williamses and Sowells than most think, and even the few that exist will have friends and family and, most importantly children, who will never be magic based POC.  Sowell has a White wife and has blamed dysfunctional nogger culture on the Scotts Irish.  They are not our people and not our friends; they ought not to be our idols either.

            What the world will look like is for White people to figure out amongst ourselves once a White future has been secured.  Why so concerned with jumping ahead and determining a set ending?  There will likely be multiple different polities with different policies, and as long as they are homogeneous with vigilantly-guarded borders, that is okay.

                Indeed. We have to remember everyone else gets a say, too. ‚ÄúThe enemy gets a vote.‚Äù If the Empire falls, what will the PoCs do? If they all head back to their homelands, great. But they may try to concentrate within white countries and form their own ethnostates, or simply hunker down in place in smaller communities. Depending on the strength of whites, these will either have to be worked around, or forced to move. Of course, the USA also has the problem of millions of blacks to whom the African homelands no longer have any meaning, so they have nowhere else to go.Another problem is what to do with all the white Progs once the system that supports them collapses. Personally I‚Äôd say drive them into the sea and remove them from the gene pool, but once they start pretending to have seen the light and accepted reality there will be those wanting to take them into the fold. Hard decisions made at that point will pay great dividends in the future.

            Well, for starters, you can again buy mainstream books, attend school classes, watch TV mainstream movies, read the news, finding in all those places no anti-White racism, no anti-Christian bile, no misandry masked as will-for-justice. Or at least not only that, as it is now.
Wouldn‚Äôt that be a good start?

        I‚Äôm planning on trying to bring more of my close friends and family over to ‚Äúour side of the great divide,‚Äù as Zman like to say, but there are a couple of things that I worry about.First: I don‚Äôt want people to get people into this stuff and then have them lose their careers if they get doxxed. I‚Äôm kind of prepared for it myself ‚Äî I mean I wouldn‚Äôt like it, but I at least understand the risks, and anybody I try to bring over ought to know the risks too. I wonder about how to have that conversation. ‚ÄúHere is the truth, but before I show it to you, understand that you could lose almost everything if you go down this path.‚ÄùSecond: I wonder about people I know in law enforcement and the military. A lot of those guys are fairly based already (at least the ones I know are), so it won‚Äôt be TOO hard to bring them the rest of the way home ‚Äî and we probably want as many of them on our side as possible. Of course there‚Äôs always the problem with those guys of accidentally bringing in undercover spies, which I‚Äôm very well aware of. But the bigger problem for me is getting them past the civnat-style ‚Äúinstitutional‚Äù mindset they have.Specifically, I‚Äôve been trying to gently ease into this stuff with a close relative recently, and while I‚Äôve had some success, there‚Äôs a lot of resistance when it comes to the specific institution he belongs to. He sees the problems everywhere else, but with his own outfit, it‚Äôs like he can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs right in front of his face. I sympathize with his plight, since I work in the mainstream media. Guys on ‚Äúour side‚Äù tend to put a high value on being loyal to the team. If you work in an ‚Äúenemy‚Äù profession, you sort of have to develop two ways of thinking about your job. That‚Äôs another conversation I don‚Äôt know how to have. I know a lot of people would just say, ‚Äúwell give up your job and find another profession,‚Äù but past a certain age, that‚Äôs hard to do, particularly when you have a lot invested in a particular career path.That, of course, is something we need to be passing on to the younger guys: There are certain professions you should absolutely avoid for the time being, unless you‚Äôre comfortable spending most of your life ‚Äúbehind enemy lines,‚Äù so to speak.Yeesh, I just read everything I wrote there. It‚Äôs insane we have to talk this way. Here I am sounding like a Soviet dissident under Stalin, and my only political crime is that I don‚Äôt want to live in a shitty country. Unbelievable.

        If freedom has been supplanted by tyranny, it is very tragic.How could a president, if he suspected democracy was being subverted by various entities, apparently quite passively vacate office for them rather than take charge of an investigation into the suspicions of such a profound occurrence (even _if_ much of the military had deserted) ‚Ä¶If a president in office could not resist the tragedy, what hope would there be for a former president or anyone else to do so, after the suspected subverters are in office ‚Ä¶

        Z is spot on about what needs to be done but only at most 5% are willing to be part of a monkey wrench gang.Central to Whites‚Äô self identity is being a law abiding productive member of society. Whites pride themselves as supporting the police and troops, of always walking and coloring between the lines.Babylon Bee captured this mindset with their piece about ‚Äúmodern day rebel plans to grow up, get married, be productive member of society.‚ÄùThe most important thing we have to accomplish is spreading this mindset to other whites. Very visible acts help with that and that is why the fliers ‚Äúit‚Äôs OK to be White‚Äù are so great. A completely innocuous statement that would be condemned for not being celebrious enough if about any other group yet drives panic among the good people

        The normies truly believed that the Georgia senate elections could be salvaged by voting harder and were devastated by the 2√ó4 reality check that actually played out. Bongino has been in panic mode ever since and is now pushing for a resurrection in 2022 with an even bigger vote harder strategy. People who have awakened to the uselessness of voting would do well to proactively create a charade of GOP support (polling) and then either stay home or vote D. The shock effect of losing bid in ‚Äô22 might well be the final straw for the GOPe.

            I‚Äôve been making a point to review the comments at Normiecon Civnat blogs like Powerline and Briebart. The Republican party is fooked as Trump voters are abandoning the party, and rightly so. At least a third of the comments are from Trump voters who are stating openly that they will never vote Republican again.There are twenty Republican seats open in the Senate in 2022. A few weeks ago I thought the Republicans would lose 5-6. Now I think it could be 10 or more. I can now see the Republicans losing 40 seats in the House in 2022.I‚Äôm now all in favor of giving Democrats a supermajority in both chambers. Time to burn it down.

        So Mr Z, you probably have read about how the IRA brought about change.  And pretty sure the VC mostly avoided full on confrontation.  I‚Äôm actually pretty ignorant.I wonder what tactics (without violence of course) people would /have used to fight the system.  (Excuse me, I have a cough).Maybe a bit of judo thinking?  Use opponents momentum to hasten their fall?I agree with you on one point for sure.  The Constitution was a voluntary agreement (amongst states).  Central govt had no choice, and indeed was created by that mutual agreement.  It no longer exists.Now I‚Äôve confused my self.  If theres no legitimate federal gov,  what does that mean??

            True, but I won‚Äôt use the enemy‚Äôs terms. We build our own Thing, now. Words are how we (and they) secretly identify each other.

Plus, those World War terms are rather‚Ä¶ loose, I‚Äôd say.  I‚Äôd rather have a lexicon of what papers they file, which bureau stamps them, on what server system they reside, and who signs off.

Purely for purposes of curiosity, of course.

            Yes, there is a need for a new name.  Fascism is overused and most don‚Äôt know what it actually means.  It makes people‚Äôs eyes glaze over. A more descriptive word that people haven‚Äôt heard before is much better.  Managerial Authoritarianism is good.  I‚Äôve also had good success with Anti White.  Nobody‚Äôs heard that one, and it‚Äôs accurate and changes the frame. Ya gotta jolt people out of the same old tired moral framework!

        Everyone always wants to know the end game, but that depends a lot on all the ugliness that is going to happen between now and then.  Wishful thinking is not going to get you to a happy end state ‚Äì there is a lot of work and nastiness that will take place that will shape the final outcome.  Zman is correct in saying not to get ahead of ourselves and focus on the task at hand.  If we lose focus now, you are really not going to like where things end up.

        A small idea for the video and gamer types: outlandish comedy bits, maybe even a game mocking the Wokeness.

Here‚Äôs a sample of what the evil clowns are doing.  Way above the lame crud put out by Fox‚Äôs Greg Gutfield.  If they can output libel like this with such a thin thread, imagine what we can do with the abundant cornucopia that the Woked provide.

        Another thing dissidents need to do it s figure out their first principles. Do you believe in equality or hierarchy? If the latter, do you believe that hierarchical society should be based on mutual duty between classes or mutual exploitation? Should religion or state be the foundation of moral order? If religion, which one? Should the formal order of government be monarchist, aristocratic or democratic? What issues should be a matter of public interest and which should be private?If you want equality, want a moral order based on state power with a democratic government, well you‚Äôve got it. There‚Äôs no sense in complaining about the excesses of our system, or any system; they come with the territory.

            Principles are for winners. We have won nothing. Once we win, then we can craft all the principles we like to justify our victory. Right now, we have demands. Free association. Free and open elections. Free speech. Access to the financial system. And so on.

                The regime has no incentive to accede to any of these demands. They need you as a boogeyman to organize against; this is what holds their diverse coalition together and keeps guys like Biden and Schumer in charge of the the growing minority masses: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all on the same side against those evil bad whites, so there is no reason for you to come for me.‚Äù Thus, the racist ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù rhetoric in Biden‚Äôs inauguration day speech and his replacing of the Oval Office bust of Andrew Jackson with Caesar Chavez. This will grow worse for our people the more diverse and unwieldy the United States becomes.Compromise with you means endangering their interests. The democrat party can‚Äôt risk being seen as sympathetic to your plight when that might cost them their leadership roles in diverse America ‚Äî and their social status, all-white neighborhoods, and bank accounts. An AOC might throw them out for disloyalty and raise their taxes, the horror.If you want those things, you‚Äôll need to do as the Jews did and get your own nation. They spent generations dreaming about getting Israel back. They wrote books, pamphlets, held meetings, founded organizations, lobbied politicians, built communities, and created a mythos around that goal. It took time, but it worked; how many created the dream, but like Mosses never lived to see their holy land? Now, the Jews are in charge of their own destinies. That‚Äôs the way to go for our people. Because the US is well gone at this point. Having a military junta vetted for loyalty to the one party state guard a senile man who rambled about ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù in a terribly divisive inauguration speech should make that clear to all.After all, there can‚Äôt be racism against our kind if our kind has a homeland where we are the supermajority. They can‚Äôt deplatform us if our people control a government ready to come down on tech companies. They can‚Äôt close our bank accounts if that means shutting down all our bank accounts because we‚Äôre all the same.

                My point is simply that if you don‚Äôt actually have a fundamental complaint about how things are run, there‚Äôs little point in resisting the order of the day. If you like democrat, then you have to accept that cheating is going to happen, just as if you like monarchy, you accept that kings will be misled by bad advisors. If you believe in equality, what legitimate complaint do you have about the system? The question simply becomes: is your complaint a fundamental disagreement, or merely a matter of taste? For example, with trannies, do you want them to be prosecuted and removed from public space, or are just tired of them being the cause du jour? If the latter, just turn off the TV and wait for the beautiful people to pick another fad. Destroying a political economy because you‚Äôre not thrilled about a whim of fashion is a bit extreme, but destroying it because you think the whole thing is inhumane and evil is good. All I‚Äôm saying is know if your complaint is about the moral order or the current fashion, because only one if those merits warring over.

                Semi regular commenter. Perhaps a different question would help clarify things: is the problem with the system its existence or it‚Äôs management? If it‚Äôs the former, then by all means burn it down, but remember that nature abhors a vacuum so something has to replace it. It‚Äôs a bit thick to argue for the destruction of the current order and not at least have a clue of what should replace it. I dislike the current order, but I just don‚Äôt see tribalistic anarchy as improving the situation. So, I ask, what do you have in mind once you‚Äôve thrown the current system away?

                Then why do you keep doing it?Not trying to be a dink‚Ä¶ but that system was the best one created by mankind. The left wins by undermining it.

                    You‚Äôre still in the Western Warfare mindset. Big battles between big, organized armies assembled by a big, organized single system with manuals and a bullet-list of final goals.
Give that up. Small groups operating when and where they can, causing whatever trouble they can against whatever part of the system they can. No great battle. No bullet-list of specific goals. Just a simple, does this help move my general cause forward a bit.

Therefore, you fight by finding the current *new* system‚Äôs weaknesses and exploit them until they snap.  In practice, you are adopting the Left‚Äôs successful tactics as your own.  That‚Äôs the only way to fight your way out of this.

                    Yes. ‚ÄúThe system is broken‚Äù is not a very helpful slogan. The system is one of the best ever devised by man, designed by people a lot better educated and a lot better versed in history than any politician alive today.And how do you know if it‚Äôs actually broken or just usurped by enemies, if you don‚Äôt try to use the tools the fathers of the Constitution gave you?Even among the non-Q right there has been a complacence, an expectation that Orange Man would do the heavy lifting and we‚Äôd cheer and wave the pom-poms.Democratic institutions are infiltrated from the bottom up. Putting a Trump poster in your back yard is not much better than tweeting memes. Acting politically starts by being elected to your local school board or whatever. With every political office comes opportunities to hurt your enemies and help your friends.

                        You really have been on fire today, Felix. Quite right. ‚ÄúThe system is dead‚Äù is the reality. Whatever rhetoric best conveys that, rather than the ludicrous ‚Äúthe system is broken‚Äù should be employed.

                        We need to use whatever tactic works. If we can get one of us on a school board, great, then I vote. If I can put a ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK to be White‚Äù pamphlet in a library book and this causes TPTB to rail against whites, the I do that.
Do what works, back off that which doesn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt get too invested in any strategy. Be like water, my friend.

                            Of course. We must fight on all fronts where we are strong and they are weak.
But there‚Äôs a risk of throwing out the baby with the bathwater if we discard the existing constitutional framework ‚Äì
The party system should be destroyed or severely reined in, but I‚Äôd think very long and very hard before I took an axe to the trunk of the fundamentals. Becauseif we had to build a new system from scratch, I suspect it would either look pretty much like the old one or be worse.
