        “That phrase was a lot like “path to citizenship” or “secure the border” is today. It meant something different than the literal meaning.”Hmmmmm, you forgot “access to (fill in the blank)_____”

        One of the advantages touted by Billy Tauzin and Dick Armey when they advocated either a national sales tax or a flat tax (with few loopholes) was the transparency of seeing the true cost of government (assuming the cost is paid by the tax raised rather than deficit spending).  In the case of the sales tax, seeing that 15-18% at the bottom of each receipt would be, at the very least, educational.  Neal Boortz’ Fair Tax had provisions whereby the poorest would receive a rebate each month, so that “punishing the poorest and most vulnerable” would be off the table.

            The trouble with a national sales tax is the cost of implementing it. States spend a lot of money on compliance with their sales tax rules. Every cash business hides sales in order to avoid the tax. Having an army of auditors roaming the countryside would be costly and probably not effective.A flat income tax, however, would use the same apparatus in place now so it would be cheaper to install. I’m fine with having progressive rates too. Let Mitt Romney pay 25% and Joe the plumber pay 12%. If you end the tax on business and hike taxes on the rich, you get more business investment, which means more jobs and money for everyone.

        Here in Nevada our newly elected Republican assembly and our  Rhino governor just passed a very significant tax increase, including a business tax. To give more money, so they say, to our failing schools. That’s the ticket, send more money to a demonstrably bad organization. The voters passed (twice, as is the constitutional requirement) an amendment which required a two thirds majority to increase taxes. Every last Democrat voted yea, needless to say, and the turncoat Repubs will have cushy jobs awaiting their removal in the next election. But we can take it all down, and we will, in ’16 because we need only 58 thousand signatures to put the tax increase repeal  on the ballot. The amendment was passed with 80%, the new ballot measure would require only a bare majority.But it’s all a holding action in a retreat.

            That’s the pattern everywhere. The Bipartisan Grand Fusion Party works against the interests of the people. I think even at the state level winning a spot in the legislature is like hitting the lottery. These otherwise unemployable people get in office and suddenly see they can cash in by going with the program. The old line is that no man is so virtuous that he can resist the highest bidder.

        The train is traveling left. You may, if you wish, walk toward the caboose, but you are not traveling to the right.

        One of W’s big brags in his first presidential run was his reduction in Texas property taxes. If you did not pay more actual taxes (they just increased the valuations, QED), then you maybe saved $20 for the annual property rental Texas charges.
If the left one don’t get you then the right one will.

        A conservative is a person who goes only part of the way the left goes. So if, say, the lefties go hard to the left with their socialist plans to make lifers living hell for the residents of a nation, a conservative will lean a little bit that way but not too much. Thus an open border demand will have conservatives saying immigration should be allowed under certain flexible rules.Thus the conservative will be condemned by the media for not being ‘fully on board’  and being ‘on the wrong side of history’ and in fear and shame the conservatives will therefore gradually weaken even their modest proposals for some sanity before it all goes belly up.In other words, conservatives are hesitant lefties these days.

        Thank you for taking the time to answer. Your response is limited to fiscal/tax policy, which I can understand since the issues are myriad. It is much more nuanced than I expected and gives me a lot to think about. For example if Republicans favor needless borrowing than they are not conservatives. If we are under attack, then I say borrow, but otherwise we have to live within our means. I have been viscerally anti-tax but I see your point that in a democracy we raise taxes to pay for the government we choose to have. I would eliminate most ferderal departments, but this does not seem what the majority wants to do. I am a Calvin Coolidge fan, but the chances of electing another Silent Cal are nil. Your last paragraph could be turned into a book, or a college political science course.
