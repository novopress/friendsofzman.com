        I am approaching the one year anniversary of my Great Awakening, or, Mike’s Overdue Enlightenment.  The map that you link to is great.
I wish I had found this stuff a long time ago.

        The common theme among these ‘fellows’ is what I see as a deep, abiding love of the sound of their own voice. One that you missed (or maybe not) is Gagdad Bob over at OneCosmos. (Dear Lord man, is there a point in here somewhere?)I’ll shut up now.

        There is nothing new about this, NR is just another part of the NYC based media that tells what the rest of the US should think.

        I can’t be bothered to read anyone who defends and lives by the rules of his enemies. Buckley must have been too comfortable in his old age to lift an eyebrow against the neocon takeover of his rag. We should know that Chilton Williamson and Joe Sobran were editors of NR back in the day and left in disgust. Sobran wrote poignantly of the process of his awakening, and when it was complete he fired himself. There is nothing more destructive to the process of insight than a neocon.

        Why does your link to comments appear under the title rather than at the end of the post?  I don’t want to read comments BEFORE I read the article and I don’t want to have to scroll back up.  You’d get more comments if you moved the link.

Good question. I don’t know, but I’m going to assume it is the theme. I’ll figure out how to change that.
