        Firstly: “Harrison Bergeron” is by far the dumbest thing Vonnegut ever wrote, and really bizzarely and confoundingly dumb given what smart, sharp, incisive writer he was in literally everything else he ever wrote, ever. Seriously, “Anthem” is better didactic dystopian blather than “Harrison Bergeron.”Secondly: I live in a neighborhood that is, and has been for decades, a racially, religiously, and economically diverse community, admittedly a rarity, but there it is. It is pretty great. People seem to really like it.Thirdly: I am extremely skeptical of Putnam’s work on this, for about a bajillion reasons, +/- 2.7 gazillion.Fourthly: I am a member of a “tribal group.” In my broader area, not just my neighborhood but my city, there are many people belonging to my group. They do not all live near each other, though. So we go to events and gatherings specifically for that group, and do a lot of our activism, giving, and communal etc through institutions affiliated with that group. So, tribal! But – we also spend time with my coworkers. And my wife’s coworkers. And my wife’s friends from high school. And our friends from our various undergraduate and graduate schools. And people we meet through other communal activities. And those groups are often “diverse.” So there’s no big mutual exclusion between diversity and tribalism, per se.
