        Jewish people are the Canary in the Coalmine for the West. The French Jews are smart to get out, and lucky that they have Israel to go to. Where will the millions of French go? Down with the ship. Based on French history and the fact that the West in general does not yet have the will to do the tough work of ejecting Moslems from our lands, I predict that in the end, France does nothing but post more policemen in their largest cities. If they somehow manage to remember the brutality they exercised during their Revolution, then they may save themselves yet. Sweden is already gone. At this point France could go either way.

        I doubt the French or Dutch or any other native European population is significantly more anti-Jewish (I don’t like “anti-Semitic,” with its faux-scholarly and at the same time evasive ring) than are North Americans. In decades no ordinary Claude’s or Knud’s or Gianni’s or Martin’s haven’t killed any Jews now, to the best of my knowledge (that excludes hard-core lefty terrorists of course, in the 70s and 80s, maybe even 90s).It’s over-overwhelmingly the resident Muslims who are responsible for anti-Jewish threats and acts in Europe these days. No amount of residual white French anti-Jewish attitudes, real or alleged, has ever led to anything remotely comparable to the present exodus phenomenon. Scandinavian Jews will be the next to follow suit.

            I don’t think Putin means that in a bad way. Putin and Israel have been making nice and Putin has been trying to attract Jewish migration back to Russia. Gentiles think Jews are monolithic, but that’s not the case. Chabad and Reformed, for example, detest one another. Hasidim are doing OK under Putin:http://forward.com/articles/183459/russian-chief-rabbi-tells-jews-to-back-off-on-crit/?p=allMy read on Putin’s embrace of the Chabad is that he sees them as a part of the larger Russian heritage. That and they are steadfastly opposed to Western Jewry as represented by The Weekly Standard crowd. Putin is a vastly more sophisticated guy when it comes to these issue than his Western counterparts. It’s why our media likes to paint him as Hitler.
