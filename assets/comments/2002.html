        I’m a corporate lawyer.  Many of my clients are dominated by middle managers who speak this corporate jargon crap constantly.  It’s incredibly irritating and actually costs the organization more money in legal fees because I have to ask them to explain things five times so that I can understand their issues and provide them with legal advice/work product.  Frequently I resort to saying,  “Explain it to me like I’m a five year old.” That usually works.

        I dunno if I qualify as “intellectually curious” or not, but I did routinely break into my boss’s desk when I was on the graveyard shift (absurdly easy to defeat the lock) to see what he was saying about us techs to his superiors.
As I suspected – he was lying to our faces.

        “Pick up cues from around the organization to be able to raise awareness.”  Indeed, that is so female.
I left an executive job (almost said ‘position’) at a Fortune 500 company where I used to write this stuff in the 80’s and went and pounded nails for ten years before buying a small business.  Your post made me queasy.  Did I once do this?  Did I?
