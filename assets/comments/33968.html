        On pride:
It’s not a rude or insulting word, or negative in any way, unless you take your Sunday-school teacher’s warnings about the Seven Deadly Sins much too seriously.
I respectfully disagree. The manifestations of “pride” (as well as the whole gamut of seven deadly sins they cheerfully display on parade) we are forced to endure in the name of homosexuals and their affiliated degenerates is exactly the sort of manifestation of “pride” that we would have done well to take much more seriously. We have let our Sunday School teachers — and God — down badly.

            Remember the “power of pride” bumper stickers after 911?I am 2/3 way through Augustine’s city of god. My stars does he do a good job of slowly leading the reader out of this world into what has to be world. It’s no wonder that Christian’s were called anti-human. Not that post fall man is not real it’s just that things are all bassackwards.anywho, fecklessly trying to wrest himself out of the rightly ordered world because he thought he was sufficient in himself, Adam brough on  a revolt from below him: his body and the lower creatures.so pride is a huge problem. It’s possible that it can be used in a somewhat positive way but not usually

            I believe that Derb’s “an atheist” – or is it “an agnostic?”I do try not to hold that against him.I maintain that just as certainly as a body with a damaged cochlea would find it impossible to “hear” the timbres of a Stratovarius, likewise there are those who have a damaged or underdeveloped “spiritual/transcendent” perception apparatus.Tant pis, n’est-ce-pas?Happy Easter to Derb (for what it’s worth 😉 and to all his readership.

        I like the term anti-white compared to woke, but woke is fine I guess. The problem with cultural Marxism as a term is that it keeps the argument in realm of ideas and not in fixed realities like race or sex. So instead of “we have to drive cultural Marxism from our schools” I would say, “all non whites need to be driven out of North America”. Or instead of “we need to get rid of Human Resources because they are all cultural marxists” I would say, “women shouldn’t be allowed to work if a man can do the job and needs it”but that’s me

            Another big problem with the term “Cultural Marxism” is that encourages whites to continue to think in ideological terms when, to survive, they must think tribally.
The term “woke” is, at best, a substitute for “against traditional whites.”

            There’s also the huge problem of creating frivolous “work” that exists just to provide women with jobs. HR is the best example. There used to be a payroll department in every company. This was also typically staffed by women but it’s role was narrow and focused. As more and more government contracts came with “diversity” requirements, it became necessary to expand HR and since few self-respecting men wanted to become professional cucks whose job was to specifically NOT hired Whites or men, these jobs went to women. Time and again, we’ve seen that any practice that starts with government contracts eventually spreads like a plague through all of corporation-land.Once inside the corporations, the women found ways to start new “initiatives” to create more “diversity” and thus, as a side effect, hire more women. This is the real answer to the question of why White women seem to so LOVE browns and foreigners. Some of that is due to their psycho-sexual weirdness (realizing that the White tribe has been conquered and wanting to be the conqueror’s concubines). A lot though is due to knowing that if they can ram through more DIE quotas, they create more jobs for themselves by pretending to care about non-Whites. As Alzaebo points out below, women have become just another nepotistic tribe like Jews or Indians. Let one in and before long they’ve replaced everyone with their tribe.

                “why White women seem to so LOVE browns and foreigners.…realizing that the White tribe has been conquered and wanting to be the conqueror’s concubines.”
I’m told that only a statistically small percentage of white women miscegenate.  However, leaving sex aside, there is a lot of truth to the idea that white women join with all the other groups to team up against the straight, white males.
What these white women must realize there is no group that black and chosen women hate more than white women.

        Lardbutt is a miffed muff because VDARE posted the monthly number of whites killed by blacks. She’s fightin’ for her tribe of high-achievers.
We often disparage women as herdlike, or a herd mind. I slightly disagree; modern women have been remolded into a tribe mind; the Karens organize and operate as a seperate tribe, not simply as a herd enforcing the majority’s opinion.

            I noticed a long time ago, back in college in the 90s, that the girls even seemed to have their own accent. They were pronouncing vowels differently, in particular. I’m not a linguist so I can’t describe this in detail but one aspect of it was that I was sure I heard them adding a “w” sound to initial vowels. So “that’s cool.” became “that’s cwool”. I’m sure there’s more to it than that and perhaps this is old news in the linguistics field.

            Hmmm….I wonder if video or other evidence quality testimony exists. Although making the case might be a stretch, murder in the course of robbery or other crime is more likely to qualify as a capital offense. Sadly, Karmelo is &lt; 18, though.

                Yeah, yeah, capital punishment, and let’s vote harder in the popularity contests of illegtimate governments. Or
Lynching, because.
Because without, whatever else is done is insufficient to obtain necessary good results. These include morbid fear, cringeing, self-restraint, and black flight.
Mark my words. Either it’s restored and practiced often without interference by the usual hypocrites and kooksorthe end is extinction. There must be no artifical restraints such as &lt; 18.

        Benny Hill was never my thing. It was too broad and slapstick. But at the same time, a society that can’t tolerate that kind of humor is a pretty poor one.In conjunction with my other comment about “Pride,” I have always pondered whether Hill’s bawdy humor furthered the Pride Peoples’ agenda by normalizing it, or held it back by normalizing the ridicule of it. I have never been able to answer that to my satisfaction.Were we lulled by seeing Hill run around in drag or engaging in adultery and various lecheries into thinking that sort of thing is harmless, or did the harm come later when we were no longer allowed to laugh at them? Did one lead to the other? What threw everything out of balance?The 19th Amendment?

            When I was a kid Benny Hill’s show was in constant rerun on PBS. I understood the mild childlike lewdness, but the women were all horribly aged (British), so it sometimes seemed actually perverse to me. (Like theotherBritish, I was into ten-year-olds.) It felt like The Three Stooges for dirty old geezers—a character I only knew from British songs. That combination is probably the reason Ihadan idea of perversity, as a child, since the pervs hadn’t taken over American schools yet, and my parents were normal psychotics, not sexual ones.When I grew up I knew Andy Partridge for a while, one of England’s five or so greatest songwriters. At the time he was in a retro-psychedelic phase and wearing John Lennon glasses. (He probably still does, but I avoid looking at old celebrities whose young faces I know well.) I thought of them as Benny Hill glasses. I never mentioned that for fear of injuring his self-image (and my career). He’s older than I am, so that recognition was already in him somewhere.Anyway, the point: Even Benny Hill was officially regarded as upper-middlebrow, back whenEnglandstill meantcultureto us, not so long ago. Strange to think in current_year, when England is a horror-shithole par excellence.

        In the eyes of the left, the right is almost always motivated by greed (Franklin Roosevelt’s “malefactors of great wealth”), hate (“racism,” “xenophobia,” “homophobia,” “anti-Semitism,” “bigotry”) or just general irrationality, if not outright insanity (“the paranoiac fringe”).It seems to be impossible for the left to acknowledge that those who disagree with it from the right do so because they are rationally convinced of the truth of what they believe and the moral necessity of acting on it. To the mentality of the left, there’s always an ulterior, and discreditable, reason why anyone disagrees with it.Sam Francissad, the link is to vdare of pleasant memory…

            Television has come a far ways since the earliest days of broadcast. Now that morality conditions have been loosened, it’s possible to have shows that more closely approximate reality. The question is, is it a common reality or a strictly minority taste being rammed down our throats?

            I don’t think anyone is “rationally convinced of the truth of what they believe”.In the largest sense it’s a spiritual and (maybe the same thing) an aesthetic judgment.If you see a fat black lesbian in a crew cut or a lisping twink you are either intrinsically disgusted or you are not.  If the former you are not prepared to be “rarionally convinced” that actually you are witnessing something great and at least the equal of a wife nursing her new baby.  If the latter you are already malfunctioning and fully prepared to be convinced of all sorts of things.Credo ut intelligam, I understand because I believe… not the other way round.

        Cultural Marxism (or KultMarx) is a useful term. It describes a variant of communism. That’s why the Left hates it so much and wants to censor any mention of it. The same for Woke or Wokeness.Communist ideology is never static – it mutates. It is like any mutating virus. Its goal is the death of it’s host society.The author gives three examples:1.Kilmar Abrego Garcia– Democrats like illegal aliens. For them, it’s more the better.2.Karmelo Anthony– another black criminal. Democrats like them too. The courts have freed him on bail. A Black jury will acquit him, so that he can kill more Whites.3.Luigi Mangione– guilty of murder-one. However, he is White. Therefore, the law will apply. If he were Black, the courts would acquit him.

        Two jewels in this article:(1) “The case for repealing the Nineteenth Amendment gets stronger by the hour.”(2) “The proper approach to removing the twenty or thirty million illegal aliens — nobody knows the exact number — from our country isnotto arrest them and try them in court one by one. We don’t have that much jail space, and all those trials and subsequent appeals would take centuries, possibly millennia.The proper approach to removing the twenty or thirty million illegal aliens — nobody knows the exact number — from our country isnotto arrest them and try them in court one by one. We don’t have that much jail space, and all those trials and subsequent appeals would take centuries, possibly millennia.”Concerning number (2) above, besides encouraging self-deportation, we could accept the idea that each illegal alien does not deserve or require full blown “due process” (whatever that means in these circumstances). My understanding is that 5% or fewer of all illegal aliens have any sort of case to argue and review. A quick tribunal type format with 5 minutes to plead the case would be sufficient for most. The 5% outliers could move on to a more thorough review.

How do you figure that it could besohigh? Did you read that atConservatard Review? My understanding is that 100% of [ahem ahem] illegal aliens deserve to be designated invaders, just like a great proportion of nominally legal aliens, who are tools of fifth columnists.

        “Prior to that, though, we voted for Reagan in ’80 and ’84, for Nixon in ’72, for Ike in ’52 and ’56, Dewey in ’48, and — bless their sweet souls — for Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover in the Arcadian 1920s.”Ike switched to the R faction in ’51 or ’52. During an important address in early ’53, he saidI propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces.Because our principles! And because segregation gives internationalist commies the sads. Imagine believing that you need to appease a few internationalist commies if you are already willing to blast or burnmillionsof civilians to death in order to make (i) the world safe for democracy, (ii) eastern Evrope safe for communism, and (iii) all of Evrope safe for Jewish supremacism in the ME.Ike was a DIE fanatic long before the public became familiar with the acronym DEI. In ’57, he seized control of the Arkansas “National” Guard and sent in the 101st Airborne to terrorize the people of the state to tolerate compulsory association with the pieces of obsolete farming equipment. Imagine doing that with a straight face like Ike. Because “national” security and other fake excuses. And let’s make, he said, the DC a model for compulsory association with the poofes in schools throughout the union’s territory. Busing was a big thing in cities like Detroit by the 70’s. Visit Detroit if you remain uncertain about the long term consequences of voting to impose DIE with rifles and bayonets and make it easy to flee into sprawling suburbs by developing a vast multilane, controlled access expressway system.That brings me to Reagan, another longtime D faction supporter who developed cold feet. So he joined the coalition for slowing down, ran for president, and won. He, too, was a president for conservatards, who were already well on their way to believing in little more than faking GDP numbers and putting Israel first.

            To his credit, Herbert Hoover was born a Quaker* [go figure], but he was [to the best of my knowledge] the only prominent statesman in the New World who fully realized the existential magnitude of the j00ish menace [via his study of the proto-Holodomor in Russia, prior to the subsequent Holodomor in the Ukraine].Meyer Henoch Wallach Finklestein, aka Maxim Litvinov:“Well, there is no famine.”That’s why the conspirators of Jekyll Island tossed the 1929 economy into the garbage bin; because they couldn’t allow a Truth Speaker, such as Herbert Hoover, to dominate the ZeitGeist; Hoover was an existential threat to them, and they destroyed him as a result.=========================*100 years later, {Quaker} x {j00} marriages are now very common in the 21st Century [although the Palestinian Question may put an end to that trend].https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Institution_Library_and_Archives

You don’t say. Now the muddled scholarship on the big crash and later depression makes sense. That tidbit about Hoover is worth repeating ad nauseum in the presence of patriotards and Judeophiles.

        I would have liked a patriotic acknowledgement of this week being the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolutionary War.  It was commemorated at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts with reenactments before cheering crowds.  We must remember and honor the sacrifices of those who came before and be grateful for the freedoms they bequeathed to us.

            No it’s time to get over all that.  We have loyalty to our nation and our creed but I dont spend a minute thinking of this political entity except to curse it.  Was it ever worth supporting?  Certainly not when it was sending tens of thousands of young white christian american men to die in order to kill young white christian europeans.  As a southerner I can hardley look back fondly to the time it sent young white christian men from the north to murder young white christian men from the south and to destroy our land and way of life.So what are we supposed to feel warm allegiance to with regard to this government?  The Andrew Jackson administration?  The brief period (less than a lifetime) before the war between the states?  That’s far far too thin a reed to even start to counterbalance the endless destruction of our people, especially in proportion to the degree of allegiance they were made to feel.

        Here’s a link to what appears to be an official UK court document. On the first page appears the uncensored offensive post that led to her conviction.https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Connollysentence.pdfThe particular charge Lucy is convicted of is “distributing material with the intention of stirring up racial hatred.” There’s just one problem here: Nowhere, not even remotely, anywhere in her posting has she singled out any race. Clearly, her words were anger against (by inference) alien “bastards” as well as government. And yes, her words are easily seen as an incitement to violence. But even granting she admits herself a racist, I fail to see any strictly racist statement in there.It seems to me that she should have been charged with “incitement to public disorder” or “to violence” or something more appropriate. Heck, I think at least on paper, even in the US you could get in trouble for (pardon the pun) such inflammatory language.I’m splitting hairs here, I realize. The important message here of course is that we in the USA should hug our 1st Amendment. If an American had posted such a message, the worst that would happen is he’d be suspended or banned. But in the UK, and a great many other so-called democracies, such speech routinely lands you in prison for a couple years.
