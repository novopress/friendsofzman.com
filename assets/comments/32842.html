        At the macro level, it is as if the West is controlled by an alien class that is here to harvest what they can before moving on to the next opportunity to run the next grift.
Imagine that….

            They have given us into the hand of new unhappy lords,Lords without anger or honour, who dare not carry their swords.They fight by shuffling papers; they have bright dead alien eyes;They look at our labour and laughter as a tired man looks at flies.And the load of their loveless pity is worse than the ancient wrongs,Their doors are shut in the evening; and they know no songs.

        Ukraine is quickly being forgotten. If all the regime mouthpieces dropped it, it would simply cease to exist. Maybe if an old blue and yellow flag is accidentally left still flying on some cat lady’s stoop , people would drive by and say:
oh yeah, Ukraine! Wonder what happened to that guy….

            I dunno. It might end up like Covid — normal people have forgotten it and moved on with their lives, but there are still a LOT of lunatics out there, masking up and huddling under their beds with barrels of hand sanitizer. These people are panic junkies and can’t let anything go… and that’s before you get to the Neocons, who have never let one single thing go, ever. They might be able to keep it in their pants through Fortification Day, but once Harris is installed, AINO is going to war with somebody — Russia, Iran, China, or, as our newest Real Americans might say, por que no los tres?

                Ukraine support has turned into a highly delusional subculture online. There are many YouTube channels and Twitter accounts making bank feeding these people fantasies about Ukraine winning. I can see this aspect carrying in for a long time, especially if the Ukraine army disintegrates and we get an “insurgency phase” like we saw in Iraq. I see a lot of evidence that the neocons are preparing such a scenario.

                    The Neocons always screw up, so by necessity they’re great at making lemonade out of lemons. They’d love to do a fake-and-gay ISIS in Iraq thing, where AINO = ISIS and Russia = AINO. The secret squirrels get to keep playing James Bond, the Big Guy gets 10% in perpetuity… what’s not to like?

                        This is happening in Syria now. Israel and the United States created ISIS, and now fighting the group is the pretext for occupation of Syria in perpetuity. It is among the damnest things ever and people pretend like it either is real or doesn’t exist.

                        I am torn on a insurgency strategy working in Ukraine. East of the Dnieper, support for the nationalists is zero, so they would struggle to hide amongst the population. In the West there is support, but the Russians are not going to be putting their army in the West.
The end game is going to be wild.

                            Putin seems to be an extremely cynical guy, so the end game may involve letting Western/”Western” interests exploit just enough of Ukraine’s wealth to forestall insurgency or something along those lines. Futility is not an obstacle to the Neocons, so it may be cheaper to let Blackrock, for example, to get enough of a taste.

                            The problem for Russia is what to do with the West. They don’t want to rule it, but they also don’t want it independent and thus joining NATO.
Sure, they could put a friendly govt in at first, but how do you maintain that forever.

                                Good question. What I’d see happening is a cessation of hostility based upon “non-alliance”—in NATO especially. The first move towards such automatically triggers war. However, that would require Russia to maintain a military strength/presence heretofore not considered necessary.
We really screwed the pooch on this one. We turned a relatively peaceful nation into a formidable adversary with this war. Seems we are intending to doing the same with China—except that China has the economic means to handle such in the long run.

Perhaps not the demographic means, though.

                                    Don’t forget that the Russians pleaded with us not to do this in 2021. They wanted to come to an agreement, and I think they would have been much more conciliant than they are now, but [Biden] wouldn’t even meet them for talks to discuss it.
This was an error as unnecessary and as huge as Mustache Guy attacking his only remaining provider of energy while still at war with the Brits.

                                Exactly, Russia’s headache is finding a way to stop blinken and nuland from sneaking in nuclear tipped missiles west of the Dnieper after the conventional war ends while not exposing Russian soldiers to being blown up while babysitting the place. I don’t know how they would do that

                            “In the West there is support, but the Russians are not going to be putting their army in the West.”
Really?  How many males or people in general flooded out of the Ukraine at the start of the war because they wanted no part.  And based on their recruiting tactics i’d say they don’t have much support at all.  What you have left in West Ukraine are the same people who support democrats here, worthless without institutional support.

                                    The crazy thing is that Tusk’s father was a Nazi collaborator, maybe not so crazy because the son is the same. The liver sausage Scholtz father was pretty high up in one of their police organizations during the war too. Look at the early lives and families of a lot of the ruling class in the EU now and you probably won’t be surprised at how many fathers were party members and Quislings in the 39-45 time frame.

                            White men have not waged insurgencies in the modern era. There was some minor stuff like that in Germany, but nothing of any real consequence. Insurgencies require:A. Lots and lots of angry and disposable young men with no future BUT fighting.B. Tribal societies that can and will take massive manpower losses found in insurgencies.C. Safe rear areas outside government control — not sure if that applies to Poland/Romania if raids are launched there — its not applying to Hezbollah in Lebanon now.My guess is that Russia, barring NATO troops which is likely, will seek to occupy all of Ukraine right up to the border of Poland and Romania, and kick all the Western Ukranians out where they will cause trouble in Poland and Germany. Giving the lands over to favored populations in Russia as a reward. This keeps missiles farther away and avoids a Kursk II operation. Giving followers land has been a winner since Alexander so I expect Putin to do it.Though I see very likely US and French troops and also UK troops fighting the Russians likely in late November, so there is that. Biden could even pull a Zelensky in that case and avoid leaving office, keeping his team in place. Or Obama could simply take over if he wanted. Anything is possible. The limits we thought applied simply do not exist any more.

By the way, haven’t seen you for a while.  Hope that you’re well…

And DC does not want to do anything.Sponsoring endless wars on the other side of the world, otoh, makes it a cinch to launder money, get on the private-contractor grift train, and all the other reasons the US militarizes distant nations.  Militarizing our borders would look real bad.  Bunch of people and equipment sittin’ around, doing nothing at all.

                    The best part about the Ukraine nut jobs is not only could they not find it on a map, but they couldn’t even tell you why they support Ukraine. It’s the same shit with the “our greatest ally” crap.
these are the same people who hate Trump but don’t know why.  They just know the juice told them to.  We truly live amongst retards.

                With Covid, it’s worse than you think. While normal people did their best to forget about it, the good bureaucrats have been busy preparing the introduction of new vaxx passports. They are piloting this in 5 EU countries right now, but the plan is to apply this to the whole EU. Later it will spread to other western countries.

                            With the introduction this month- in Japan of all places!- of “self amplifying mRNA”- they are creating the literal “I Am Legend” scenario.
The replication error rate of spikes making spikes will turn every recipient into a walking mutagenic lab and shedding factory.
The last one weakened immune systems in prep for this escalation.  The commies have already put their supporters against the wall first, with that one.

                                The UK is offering up the latest “regular” mRNA Covid jab. For those who’ve kept with the programme it’ll be #7! Assuming one started in January 2021, that would be approximately one jab every ~6.5 months. The same (or similar) article said that a jab lasts about 6 months but efficacy (is there any?) wanes after 4. Meanwhile, the excess deaths continue above historical norms. There is even the occasional article in the normal press wondering why heart disease is up 50% or more in young folk. (In fairness, the rise began in 2020, before the jabs debuted.)

                    They’ve been so lazy with the post-covid propaganda, it’s like they’re testing how crappy it can be and still work. Infinitely crappy, it turns out.The official story is that there were no lockdowns or mandates or anything like them outside of right-wing propaganda, and that any apparent economic/etc. injury to anyone is illusory, also right-wing propaganda. Your memory ofanything that happenedin 2020-1 is false. But also, all this economic ruin you see was caused by Trump Budget Cuts™ (or local equivalent) and right-wing resistance to the righteous lockdowns and mandates which during covid proved themselves theonlyeffective strategy for dealing with public health crises (any disease or right-wing attitude).This bundle of nonsense only held together bywhom it identifies as the enemyistruly believed, more strongly than their knowledge of actual events in their lives, byall good citizens. So mandates have returned, having always been here, having never happened, as official policy found only in right-wing lies, etc.It’s a good life.

                    Hun, you’re touching upon my greatest fear—a de facto acceptance of the mRNA technology.  With Covid, we undertook the greatest human subjects experimentation since the NAZI’s in WWII.  The result are not yet settled wrt the safety of the technique, yet all that seems forgotten as Big Pharma moves right along developing new uses for the process.
As I’ve warned before, we now must be very careful in even taking the old “tried and true” vaccine regimen as those vaccines will very likely be produced through mRNA technology.

                            I use the term freely as I don’t condemn all vaccines, however the CDC recommendations are now exceeding all common sense.  Here’s the latest from ChatGPT:“…the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the following vaccines during childhood, generally by age 18:1.	Hepatitis B (HepB) – 3 doses2.	Rotavirus (RV) – 2 or 3 doses depending on the brand3.	Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Acellular Pertussis (DTaP) – 5 doses4.	Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) – 3 or 4 doses depending on the brand5.	Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13) – 4 doses6.	Inactivated Poliovirus (IPV) – 4 doses7.	Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) – 2 doses8.	Varicella (chickenpox) – 2 doses9.	Hepatitis A (HepA) – 2 doses10.	Influenza (flu) – Yearly after 6 months of age11.	Meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) – 2 doses (typically for older children)12.	Human Papillomavirus (HPV) – 2 or 3 doses depending on the starting ageIn addition to these, some children may also receive vaccines like Meningococcal B and COVID-19, depending on local guidelines and risk factors.”I count 35 vaccinations before 18 yo.  Indeed, several are given *before* your child leaves the hospital after delivery.  This defies reason—unless you buy into a 100% safety factor for vaccines, which I don’t.

                        I don’t follow the mRNA story quite as closely the past year or two, and certainly not with the enthusiasm of Substackers like Malone, Berenson, Steve Kirsch, etc. You are so right about “results not yet settled” re mRNA. The same thorny questions remain, however…those that were getting people cancelled from everywhere in 2021 and 2022; viz.: Where is the evidence of long-term trials (Phase 1, 2, 3, 4, whatever)? Where is the proof of efficacy? Surely the data must exist somewhere, but they are very reluctant to release anything or allow outsiders to do detailed studies. The little that has leaked out (e.g. published by Kirsch) are tantalizing but are tainted by possible commercial motives (of the “independent” reporter, not of Evil Pharma, in this case.)Even with a general background, that is, having read about this junk since 2020 and some selected books (e.g. RFK Jr.) one can read the mainstream press and see that the jabs have many of the problems that “conspiracy theory” claimed years ago. Rarely anything about dangers to users, of course, although strange illness and deaths continue to crop up. Damar Hamlin’s cardiac event on the field in early 2023 is probably one of the more spectacular; he’s lucky to be alive and surely that’s solely due to there having been expert medical personnel on site. Athletes in top condition have undiagnosed “congenital” heart problems. Happens all the time, doncha know?Oh yeah…more relevant, and perhaps more mundane, is the implication that the shots really don’t work very well. Well, the old-fashioned flu and pneumonia shots were intended to be taken every year. They push the Covid jabs on same schedule or even more frequently.Your final warning is very apropos. To the best of my knowledge, there is precious little evidence of the long-term safety of the mRNA tech, never mind efficacy. I took my last routine immunization in late 2020 (flu/pneumonia). I swore I would never take another immunization. I did allow an exception after I was bitten by a feral cat and rabies and tetanus were a risk.

                I haven’t forgotten covid, it was perhaps the second largest crime of this century, only eclipsed by 9/11 and the wars it spawned.  Perhaps the worst if you believe the statistics they published of “died with covid”.

Don’t look now but the lunatics at theUK Telegraphjust published a completely unhinged op-ed calling for Israel to bomb all Iranian nuclear sites to foment regime change in Tehran.
The more dialed-in commentators out there think that the Israelis are most likely to strike when AINO is most pre-occupied with hurricane Milton’s landfall.

        The foreign elite ruling the West are masters of narrative, deception and subversion. It’s why their plan for Russia (their plan for everything) is regime change.They have a feminine attack mentality. They don’t attack directly but through seduction (we’ll offer you want you’ve always wanted if you give us control over your life) or through some guy that they’ve tricked into fighting for them. If that doesn’t work, they use exclusion, which is what women and our foreign elite fear most. Or they use all three in some combination.The feminine attack method can be highly effective in the right hands – and our rulers are the best – but, ultimately, it fails when it faces an opponent who fully employs the masculine attack method. If you refuse to listen to our rulers siren song about giving you everything that you want, if you beat up the guy that she tricked to attack you and if you find a new, even better “friend group,” our rulers have nothing.Our foreign rulers have been dealing with beta males for nearly 100 years, so they’ve gotten everything that they want. They’re now going up against real men for the first time in a long time. It’s not just Russia. China is doing the same both militarily and economically. Iran might be as well.The world is moving on from the old, ugly lady running the West. She offers nothing; indeed, she’s repugnant. Her boyfriend is a wuss. Her friends are just as bad. The narrative is breaking down. She also has no ability to subvert from within these countries as they are aware of her game and she can’t pull the “My fellow Chinese” act.The 20th century is mercifully ending.

                They’ve certainly learned the regime change is the preferred method of attack. They also know that the financial system is how they control countries. The rest of the world is working hard to get around that. It’ll take time, however.

It seems to me like a lot of the old aristocratic elite in Europe are in high finance. In a prior age they might be imperial governors or generals: now they run investment banks. Dutch princes as management consultants.

        The best outcome is that the rat faced bagel gets the Full Mussolini treatment, displayed upside down in a Kiev gas station. However, what would be second best is Piano Man scuttles out of the country like the Shah of Iran in 1979.I have been thinking about the possibility of a repeat of the Iranian Revolution in Ukraine, where a Ukrainian popular revolution overthrows the CIA backed regime and focuses all their hate on the US for using them as cannon fodder with a bagel leader. How do you say Great Satan in Ukrainian? Because there will be a scapegoat for this bloody disaster.

It does seem as though their current regime’s apparent intent for China to become GAE 2.0 should be cause for at leastsomeconcern, though obviously only a fool or a monster would use that to deliberately incite some kind of open armed conflict.

        Fact: a lot of good men (almost all white guys) have died in Ukraine on both sides of the conflict. And yes, this human resource is no longer available to cure the root problem (because they’re dead!). And that is exactly the plan for here in the US and EU. Kill off the white guys who might grow a spine and eventually fight back against the source of the problem. Ukraine was a test case. But we don’t have to play this game. Direct your anger where it will actually do some good.

        The looting is the point of Project Ukraine. The crumbs thrown to the politicians and their donors pale in comparison to the payout received by the Robber Barons and those burrowed in the Administrative and National Security State. This follows a pattern of outright stealing billions on a regular basis from taxpayers. It has now emerged that in addition to funneling money to NGO’s and their happy fellow travelers, FEMA spent billions on Covidin 2024. The heartbreaking death count of Slavs is the only way in which Project Ukraine is more appalling than Project Covid, which is the most despicable transfer of wealth in American history.The looming questions are the reason for the accelerated looting and why now. It seems that those on the inside realize the dollar is about to become worthless and it is a good time to convert coin to hard assets. That’s a guess but in the ballpark.

            I think the people who engineered Project Ukraine really did believe in it at the beginning. You can’t fake that level of enthusiasm, and it ties up well with their deep-seated, 300 year old grude with Russia. Project COVID, on the other hand, was entirely cynical – they knew what they were doing, they knew it was fake, it was a grift from the beginning. BUT, during Project COVID, something else emerged which they were genuinely and deeply enthusiastic about, and that is Project BLM. We saw this explicitly when they kicked COVID to the curb to let the riots get going, and the constant stream of anti-white propaganda that poured from all the nation’s organs, the same organs that embraced Ukraine so eagerly in the beginning. Of course, this is because these people hate us as much as they hate Russia, if not more.At some point you’d think that normies would get tired of being pushed from one project to the next, none of which benefit them, all of which hurt them, none of them done with their best interest in mind, but it seems that they are, for now, still along for the ride.

                Excellent comment and an upvote, but I think “engineered” is doing a lot of work there. Those appropriating/sending the money certainly are in it for the loot. The Neocons financially benefit as well as extract revenge although that certainly plays a role with them.
As for Normie, watch a cat chase the light from a laser pointer. Even when it becomes obvious there is no there there, the potential exhilaration forces them to chase it.

                    Yes, that was a point I failed to touch upon. At some point, in Afghanistan, the true believers moved on and it just became a pure looting operation. They moved to Syria, I think, which is actually still ongoing and is a looting operation. I think we are mostly in that stage of Ukraine, but nevertheless, the people who run our government still harbor that ethnic hatred of Russia and Russians and I do think that is a primary motivation for them. Do the neocons still get paid? Of course, it’s part of the deal.

            Zelensky has the support of an ethnic network that whites are unable or unwilling to see.
I guess that when Zelensky meets with Blinken, for example, whatever quarrels and irritations they may have with eachother, the deeper feeling is of brotherhood and a shared destiny that few white people can even imagine.

            I personally believe he is a hostage of MI6 at this point, and their protection of him is the only reason the nationalists haven’t yet snuffed him out. His survival plan is to do what he’s told and hope the West doesn’t “tie up loose ends” when it is finally done with him.

            People say it’s his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, pulling the strings.Zelensky is in way over his head. He campaigned for president on a peace ticket, promising to repair relations with Russia to fix the Ukraine’s economy. That got him 3/4 of the vote. Then he went to the eastern front to order the troops back as required by the Minsk accord, and they laughed at him.One of the chief Nazis told a reporter: “If he doesn’t stop talking about Minsk, we’ll hang him from a tree on Kiev’s main avenue.” Then the US took him from his Oligarch owner who wanted peace, and he’s been dancing on their strings ever since.

                Yeah, I noticed that too about Cochran. His blog was one of my favs during the last decade. But he certainly went off the deep end with covid. Peter Zeihan was also one of my favs during the last decade. He also went of the deep end over a combination of covid and TDS.
The covid debacle broke a lot of people’s brains. Curtis Yarvin being a good example. Essentially the entire HBD crowd went off the deep end over covid as well.

                    I pointed out to Cochran that the model they were using for Covid was riddled with coding errors. It was open source, so I downloaded it and like many other people, saw the huge problems. Cochran said I was crazy. When I said the Diamond Princess was a great model for understanding Covid, he banned me from his site. He was not alone. Most of the HBD people went insane during Covid.

                        I was screaming into the void in 2020 that Diamond Princess told us 98% of what we needed to know about COVID, and it was nothing to worry about for most people and could be managed. It was a perfect experiment where you had a mixture of people isolated in a location where it was able to spread more or less freely. You never get that sort of epidemiological study early during a potential pandemic, we got it, it was an incredible gift for us in terms of dealing with it… And it was ignored.

                            The Diamond Princess was one tell tale point. But I decided that covid was no big deal even before it. Those awful videos ocming out of Wuhan that February failed to materialize even before the Diamond Princess happened.
You know, we still don’t have an explanation for those awful Wuhan videos. Given that most of them came from Epoch Times, which is owned by Falon Gong, I assume they were fakes made for the purposes of discrediting the CCP.

                            It really was an incredible thing to watch. When everyone on the ship did not fall over dead at once, the whole thing was ignored. It was proof that Covid was being driven by panic junkies. Sane people should have looked at that wonderful real world, real-time study and gave a huge sigh of relief.

                        I became skeptical of Cochran a couple years prior to covid when I asked him on his blog what he thought the cause of male to female transgenderism. As you know, he has postulated that male homosexuality is caused by an infectious agent. I assumed he would present something similar for transgenderism. He did not. Instead, he trotted out the usual “multi-factorial” sociological explanation. I countered by suggesting it might be Xenoestrogens (environmental hormones). I said this was BS.
This is when I had my first doubts about him. I think this was around 2018 or so.

                            How are any of these guys possible?Dewey’s idea of grooming a Platonic aristocratic elite has hit a major hidden snag.
How can such smart, accomplished people go off the deep end, as Orwell noted about intellectuals?
It seems like there’s a design flaw we don’t recognize.Commoners like Trump or Margie Green really should be running things.  They stay afloat in shark-infested waters but retain the common touch.

                                There’s something interesting there. For some things very bright people are less rational than average Joe. One example: understanding something about how an airplane works rather than understanding nothing, can induce fear of flying. Same with medicine and a lot of other fields. Intelligent and rational do not correlate strongly

                        During that time, Z-man, your best pointer was to statistician Briggs.  He had an insight into modeling that turned my entire thinking around.  He attacked not the math or software, but the very concept of understanding which under-lied the process.
I steal from him shamelessly without attribution and no longer trust most modeling.

                    2020 discredited anyone whose work/self-image rests on the dream of properly run government. Even Sweden and Japan didn’t make it. The rational,capaciousstate is a nerd “power fantasy” (stupid media term but it fits).

Government is a crime. Crime is a specialty of morons, madmen, and cowards. It cannot be done well—in the judgment of its victims. The lazy way out of this problem:Side with it. Consider it you.Covid was the first opportunity for nerds to do that. Government finally not by charters but bycharts!

And if I’m elected, total nerd death.

                    I think what spooked the HBD crowd  is that they knew it was an engineered bioweapon from the get go. They just thought it was a better bioweapon. It quickly mutated into more benign forms. Presumably that “flaw” can be corrected the next time, so they are still scared shitless.
Maybe all of us should be.

            Woah shinola – what if the Azov guys decided to switch sides?That’s what mercenary companies do, it happened all the time from 1200-1800, and it happened over there.
That would be a force to be reckoned with.Good grief, what if Ukraine ended up conquering the EU?

        Perhaps the only thing worth learning in business school or economics class is this: Ignore sunk costs. Project Ukraine is a write-off. The MIC shouldn’t care – the war has shown that all our gear is obsolete! They can make a fortune in peacetime on new drones, UAVs, ELINT gear, hypersonic missiles, new ECM gear etc. So you’d think they are utterly indifferent. This war is being sustained by the political class who would have to admit defeat. And this system just cannot tolerate any admission of mistakes.

        “So far, he has outmaneuvered all of his opponents in Kiev, which is miraculous.”
This is a bit of a stretch, he has NATO, CIA, and whomever else on his side, endless bribe money, cancelled elections and throws his opponents in jail or outright criminalizes anyone who opposes him.  Hard to maneuver when your balls and limbs are cut off.

        Thisstorycovers the basics of the new plan for victory. Russia would be handed a deal whereby they get to hold the lands they have, Ukraine joins NATO, but promises to not start a war to reclaim those lands and at some point in the future,Russia has probably learned its lesson and understands that a piece of paper will not guarantee peace on its Western front.  America has been ignoring treaty obligations almost since day one.  “America’s signature” is not worth the paper it’s printed on.Any “deal” that allows what is left of Ukraine to join NATO is a guarantee of a new war at some time in the future.

From building consumer cities in Iraq and Afghanistan to funding Sunny Isles palaces and international disco parties and Replacement Migration NGOs. Not much left for Western NC.

        Since zelinsky is the guy pushing for missile strikes that the Russians – understandably – have said will escalate to general war and he is trapped while still holding some political leverage it seem the rationally cold thing to do is to either get rid of him. Or give him a golden bridge out. I don’t really care if he takes a bullet or snorts cocaine in Chelsea. But this little mouse has to shut the F up about things that could get everyone incinerated

        No part of this “plan” is remotely feasible…Zelensky is not in office, and Putin quite logically has said he will not deal with him, only an elected representative of the Ukraine…Having wasted its best men and equipment on the Kursk adventure, Ukraine is getting rolled up on most fronts, and its conscripts are very sensibly avoiding battle by refusing orders or deserting..There is really nothing to negotiate, and if Putin were to offer a reasonable deal, like the Istanbul deal that was fortunately (for Russia) aborted by Zelensky’s allies, Putin would be overruled by the military and Medvedev’s allies…The Russian people want blood at this point…

            How does that figure into a victorious strategy? If the war goods nuke, does Zelenskyy think he can watch from Kiev the fireworks show? I suspect Russia will drop some well placed nukes on Ukraine as well while they attend to business with NATA and the US.

        Despite having the best equipment and the best men, they have been held in reserve for most of the war, most likely for political reasons.
They are not “in reserve”. They are behind the lines because their true role is to prevent the conscripts from deserting in any direction other than towards Russian lines.

            I think that has come to an end. We no longer hear about ideological officers in the ranks. Most likely it is because they are dead. The losses of the Ukraine army are massive. There are stories coming out from Ukraine sources that units along the front are thirty percent of strength and lower. They are relying on drones and motorized artillery to defend the fortifications that are mostly empty. This explains Russian progress.

        The Ukraine War will never end because the Elites will never, ever let it end. A Forever War against Russia allows them the “moral excuse” which they always, always need to assert total control and dominance against their real enemy: Straight White Men.The Stoltenberg Plan is the carrot for Russia, which will not of course take it. The stick is sending in massive amounts of NATO troops in. France has announced “exercises” in Romania to practice fighting Russia in Ukraine. I fully expect the Biden Regime to put US forces in Ukraine a few days after the election. This way they can shape things the way they want. These troops will be bolstered by French, UK, Danish, German, Italian, and Greek troops along with other NATO members: Sweden, Finland, etc. They will not push onto Moscow but will both stabilize the situation in the East and enlarge the Kursk incursion. Russia is assumed to do nothing as Stoltenberg and others have said repeatedly, Putin’s red lines are imaginary. He can and will do nothing. No one in Brussels or Washington fears any Russian response.Note: Jack Smith won over Twitter/X and Musk over handing over every bit of information of ordinary users who retweeted or liked anything Trump posted on X. The Supreme Court rejected Twiiter/X’s argument that this was an infringement of speech. Why would Smith want this data? To have a massive arrest list of course!There was another trial balloon in the FT also over the draft, with British Military officials (generals mostly) again calling for a massive draft (Straight White Men only of course) and a non-military one for defense production (Whites only of course). This will happen here, also.The model for society that the Elites have is China rounding up the Uighurs in a “kinder, gentler” series of camps. The manpower of course is the low-IQ third world that has been imported, deliberately young fighting age men. Solution: have them engage in Rwanda style attacks, round up YT into camps, the men of fighting age are drafted like the US did with the Nisei in WWII, the rest are in work camps. Forever.The YT problem is solved and we have another Forever War conveniently over there, not here. That is at least the plan I see outlines of in the various trial balloons in the FT.

        ‘That may be the reason why Zelensky created the plan and spent the last month shopping it around the West.’Huh?  That idiot Zelensky doesn’t ‘create’ any plans.  He doesn’t return to Ukraine, sit in his office with advisors, and formulate the next strategic or tactical move.  He is only a frontman — a stooge of public face — the counterpart of Tater Joe Biden or Kammie Harris or Boris Johnson.Combined US/British intel formulates (and executes) policy and plans.  This would never be allowed into the hands of ridiculous individuals like Zelensky or Biden.  It is ludicrous to imagine so.U.S. armchair generals blogging in-depth about the Ukraine War is just hubris.  ‘Experts’ lol.  We are the rump of the food-info-chain, the END-CONSUMERS of whatever data the intel agencies wish us to know . . . unless you have personal agents on the ground in Ukraine, which you do not.  Zelensky is only a tool, and not a very sharp one at that.  That is considered a plus by intel, btw.Write about things you know — like yesterday’s piece — not about things you don’t, but imagine you do.  LOL.  Amazing.

        The Ukrainians, buoyed emotionally by continued Western support, continue to step beyond their means. Their “victory plan” has the hallmark of an LSD trip taken during a very stressful time, and it will similarly end in a bad experience.Washington has developed an addiction to helping get weak client states out of a jam. With the Cold War over, there is no reason to be in Taiwan, South Korea, or have a military base in Cuba. Taiwan is rightfully a province of China, the South Koreans should just offer North Korea’s top leadership $100 million U.S. each if they fold their country into the South, and Ukraine must be abandoned as a hopeless and brazenly dangerous lost cause.
