        I spent about 6 months in Sri Lanka for a semester abroad,  When I got there, everyone looked the same.  By the time I left, I could instantly distinguish the Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslims with a glance.
Like the upper-caste northern Indians, the Sinhalese consider themselves Aryan people who migrated down from northwest Asia (which has been proven out).  So it wasn’t unusual to see the backwards swastikas above store fronts.

        Leftist idiots like Ms. Faker are ignorant (accidentally or purposely) of history.  Of course her father hated Muslims.  The Muslims carried out a holocaust of unimaginable scale in India for centuries.

        Happy hatin’, Z!My link to the Snowflake story is all redacted. Hmpfffff.Snowflakism, daddy issues, SJWism – all of it is a means of rebellion, power and control. The bad guys discovered that if they throw childish tantrums – we automatically back up, go quiet, and wonder how to settle them down to reason with them. And you’re also right in that the response to this should be contemptuous laughter and a raised middle finger. As you note, as I learned with my own proggie family… it never stops. No concessions will work, no compromise is possible, they may not realize it themselves – but they want you to shut up, do as you’re told, or to sod off. That last one is the best option.Let us know how the trip goes!

        Reasonableness may be necessary but it is manifestly not sufficient.Most older people are too comfortable and scared to every support a racial or radical movement.  The best we can hope for from reasonableness is to:  1) give older and comfortable people permission to vote for immigration restriction if they are certain they won’t be found out and 2) persuade a few millionaires to bankroll some of our projects.There are far more prospective converts who are young and their attention is not captured by reasonableness, although it may help bolster their beliefs after their conversion.  Don’t let respectability get in the way of capturing the attention of the young.  This is not an argument for street brawling or against cogent arguments, it is an argument for doing whatever it takes to convert the young.  Anglin and Enoch are a good examples.Fortunately, we can run with both approaches simultaneously as long as they can avoid fighting with each other.

        “Reasonableness” is one of the best pieces you’ve written or spoken since I’ve been following you. “We must not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.” What’s happening in South Africa may not be exactly what happens here, but it sure will rhyme. Creating allies, persuading people, producing a solid center of based people who can influence the direction of the country, rather than just cavorting on the sidelines, is what really matters. Tim

            I wouldn’t dare venture a guess.   But I think the word I learned here last week from a fellow poster sums it up: “Backpfeifengesicht” (face that should be slapped.)   I assume these people are Trustafarians as I will not be hiring them.

        The  cry closet generation is very real.  Like Pavlov’s dogs, they are conditioned . From earliest childhood  they are immersed in a  combination of shame and guilt about all things non- PC. Like an abused dog , they have a visceral emotional response to anything non PC that completely bypasses the thought processes.  Emotional pain is as real as physical pain, and they have been subjected to emotional torture by the educational system , the media , and social media.They rightly fear that the wrong word on falsebook and their friends and family will reject them , they will be publicly  humiliated, and they may even  be beaten.I don’t know if deprogramming them is even possible. It certainly won’t be easy.

        Re Easter Island in your vacation segment – while the island is pretty barren, it also has those great big stone heads, the moai, from a long time ago that are all over, created by the original Polynesian settlers. Thor Heyerdahl had some interesting ideas  – read his book “Kon-Tiki” (I don’t endorse his theories but it’s a great adventure story).

            One of those stone heads is on display in Valparaíso, Chile.
No need to fly out to Easter Island if you want to do a selfie with one of those stone heads.
