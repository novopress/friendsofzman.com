        THE SOUL’S DESERT
(written August 30, 1939)
They are warming up the old horrors; and all that they
say is echoes of echoes.
Beware of taking sides; only watch.
These are not criminals, nor hucksters and little jour-
nalists, but the governments
Of the great nations; men favorably
Representative of massed humanity. Observe them.
Wrath and laughter
Are quite irrelevant. Clearly it is time
To become disillusioned, each person to enter his own
soul’s desert
And look for God—having seen man.
–Robinson JeffersAmerican(1887-1962)
