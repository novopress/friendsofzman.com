        Compulsory voting is, obviously, authoritarian. Leftist are by nature authoritarian. Universal suffrage being a revolutionary instrument itself, compulsory voting is a one way street to hell.

        The Aussies have some things working for them. It is one of the least populated bits of land on earth. Compulsory cooperation rises with population density. They also have a tiny NAM population. The Asian population is somewhere around 10% of the total.
They also avoided the whole legacy of slavery business that has deranged the rest of the occident. The Aussies also avoided the “terrors” of colonialism. Instead, you have a white population of misfits, adventurers and outcasts.

        UKer: Interestingly, Australians always vote on a Saturday and election time has to be either after cricket season in March or after football season in October – and it’s compulsory!! For you to not vote in Australia, there need be a good reason. Australians have always made good choices at the polls through elections and referendums, perhaps because the majority of enrolled voters have had to do it.

        As a retired “working man” I’ve never forgiven Nixon for the wage and price controls of the early-mid 70s. From about 1966 until then wage rates were moving up fast along with the purchasing power of the dollar.Since then, wages have risen at a much slower rate while inflation and taxes have reduced the value of the dollar to push the living standard of workers downward. All by design, thank you and fuck you Nixon.The second major blow to common citizens came in 2001 with the “patriot act.” This prepackaged law, waiting quietly for the correct crises, imposed the police state structure(Gestapo) and the ultimate demise of freedom. I don’t “miss you yet” Mr Bush, and double fuck you.All the giddy celebrations about this election will turn to disappointed misery as soon as the next Congress starts lying and reaching out and across the aisle to sellout the fools that elected them.

        Walt: In the UK it is Thursday for voting, and Thursday night is traditionally a ho-hum night on TV here so while that seems good, it can rain. Indeed it can positively chuck it down. UK politicians know that the working man would rather stay in on a wet Thursday night and go out to vote, so that balances the books.

        The United States has never really wanted its electorate to vote. What a pain for the most powerful government in the world to need to listen to its uneducated and mostly obnoxious subjects.
The initial idea was to hold elections on Tuesday when the working man would be too busy to turn out. Now that the working man is the perpetually unemployed man, a few more jilted voters have the chance to make their voice’s heard. The only shame is that they are voting for Wall Street and ultimately their own demise.
