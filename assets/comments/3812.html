        Huh, so people exaggerate in eulogies? Weird.Look, it is indisputable that Jon Stewart is an extremely influential figure. We all know his name and schtick. Liking the Daily Show has become a synecdoche for a political stance and you don’t need to have watched the show more than a handful of times to know what that stance is. He represents something in the same way that Bill O’Reilly and Brian Williams do and it’s asinine to suggest otherwise based on nightly viewership statistics. You ordinarily don’t have much patience for obtuse data nerds. I wonder why this is an exception?Flatire is a good portmanteau word, but the content of your criticism is so trite that silly Buzzfeed-loving twentysomethings have been saying more or less the same thing for years: I don’t like the Daily Show because people who can’t even answer first round Jeopardy questions watch it in order to feel smart and superior. What Stewart is up to is common knowledge, but you have to admire the skill with which he pulls it off.

        Maher is right about Islam. I don’t  think he’s that bad, or at least not a bad as a typical Salon writer. He tends to look at things from a perspective of left-leaning spectator, making mockery of the absurdities of politicians and ideological zealots and the weird beliefs many of them hold. The fact liberals frequently criticize  Maher suggests he’s doing something right.

        “In 2012 Bill Maher made a personal donation of one million dollars to Obama’s Super PAC, Priorities USA Action. His explained that having a country governed by Barack Obama rather than any of the Republican candidates is “worth a million dollars” and that in his own financial interests, “this is the wisest investment I think I could make.” He also encouraged other wealthy liberals to do the same and give until it hurts.”Act or not, he went all in with real money…That makes him a persona non grata at my house.He also thinks gravity is a Jewish plot to steal pennies…

            Don’t get me wrong. Maher is a kook and a dirtbag. I have a good story about him and a hooker in Miami.
I just meant he creates his routine to titillate the lunatics. Chris Hitchens called his crowd barking seals, I think, and said Maher was feeding them fish.

        It’s funny how nobody in the MSM describes Stewart as a liberal commentator, progressive advocate or anything like that.
In fact, as of this moment there are zero hits for the word “liberal” on Jon Stewartswikipedia entry, whileEl Rushbo, as a counter example, has “conservative political commentator” in the very first sentence!
Stewart would probably smack you if you called him biased, again from the wiki entry: “Stewart denied the show has any intentional political agenda”.

            I’ve never been a Stewart fan, but I have sensible friends who think he is funny. I’m told his stand up is not very political and very good. I’m not going to knock anyone for their tastes. I suspect Stewart knew the score from the start. He’s probably a natural liberal, but he also figured out that there was gold in patting liberals on the head every night. I know Bill Maher deliberately plays the crazy lefty routine on purpose. It’s all an act with him. He’s not a right winger or anything like that, but he knows he is offering up boob bait for the bobos.The best thing I saw with regard to Stewart was his first interview with O’Reilly. Bill is a blowhard, but he is shrewd. He knew Stewart had become a hothouse flower so the setup was perfect. I honestly thought Stewart was going to pass out or maybe have a stroke. O’Reilly set the trap perfectly.

        First Brian Williams, Professional Prevaricator, leaves then King of Snark Jon Stewart. What will people who want fake news do? I guess there’s always MSNBC.

        “In other words, the great millennial following of The Daily Show is a total myth.”Of course it is.  Stewart’s overall viewership peaked in early 2013, with about 2.5 million viewers, and it’s been all downhill ever since.  Lately he’s struggled to break 1.5 million; the last few broadcasts, post retirement announcement, when you’d expect Stewart’s bereft, emotionally devastated progressive fan base to come running back for the last tongue bath, have only produced numbers around 1.6-1.7 million.  To put this in perspective, Huckabee managed to pull in 1.7 million viewers on his old Fox show; O’Reilly regularly tops 3 million; Robot Chicken beats Stewart both in total viewers and in the adult demo.The simple fact is that Stewart’s show is not satire, is not intelligent, and is not funny.  Stewart mugs, preens, bellows, and pops his eyes; he seems to be channeling Mantan Moreland keeling over at the sight of ghosties in some old Bowery Boy flick, except that Stewart is now keeling over at the sight of conservatives.  This guy is no Tom Leher.Of course, Jon Stewart is not paid $25 million a year to attract viewers; Matt Lauer, who pulls in 4 times as many, and whose show, Today, is keeping NBC afloat, is paid the same.  Nor is Stewart paid to reinforce and advance the narrative – that was Brian Williams’s job, and he got paid half as much.  Rather, Stewart is paid, as Kevin Williams and John Nolte have pointed out, to destroy – to lambast and ridicule conservatives as people, to make them appear dumb, oafish, evil, hypocritical, and cloddish, so that their arguments don’t have to be addressed.  Stewart is perfect for this because, as a comedian, he is not restrained by the phony gravitas that burdens Williams and his ilk.  Stewart can go all out on a buffoonish limb, in the process providing short, simple, cartoonish, ready-to-go-viral YouTube-ready video clips that the wider media can refer to whenever a conservative or conservative argument needs to be slapped down.  Whenever a guy like Jonathan Gruber spills the beans on Obamacare, they can cut to Stewart dropping his pants and choking on his latte while Sarah Palin rants about Death Panels.  Score!No wonder the entire Progressive apparatus, both government and media, is wailing like a dead terrorist’s mother at the announcement of Stewart’s retirement.  Like Fake Indian tweeted, it’s because he spoke truth to power…My guess is the guy runs for President.

        “His act is flatire, satire intended to flatter the audience”
Well played, Sir.  With your permission, I will steal that someday.
