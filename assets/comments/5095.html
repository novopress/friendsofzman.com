        I don’t think the elites know how to apply violence.  It shows in everything they are doing overseas.  I think that they have bought so thoroughly into the Gramscian control methods and believe in their efficacy so completely that they have no real violent alternative but to empty the inner cities into the suburbs.  I cannot see that going on for long before it culminates… no logistics, no command and control, no operational or strategic objectives… plus as they get farther into the burbs, they will run into more and more people willing to shoot back.Kind of the neat thing about living in these times is how many outcomes are possible.  In the Cold War, the number of outcomes were very well defined: the First World capitulates, the Second World capitulates, MAD, or indefinite Cold War.  The list of possibilities now is endless.  Russian collapse. Chicom collapse. EU collapse with or without end-of-Bronze-Age level immigration.  US secession movements.  EU fascist resurgence. Full First World energy independence with Arab collapse.  Everyone seems to assume that MAD is off the table, but I believe that it is more likely today than in the early 60’s.  I’ve even toyed with the idea of a Latin American Renaissance as Evangelical Protestantism and work ethic spread.

            You don’t retain power in middle class western nation states by applying violence. If things are so bad that a large number of citizens represent a threat, the state has lost its legitimacy already.

        “…[D]ress-over-the-head rants….” My, what a wonderful turn of phrase!  Nice work, Z man!
I think I might begin to prefer “dress-over-the-head” to the similar “pearl clutching.”  Although “pearl clutching” creates an image so nicely redolent of Margaret Dumont’s comedic powers.  How shall I choose a favorite?

        Interesting times we live in.  The way things are going, we will soon find out whether “the powers that be” have no control over the public whatsoever (and perhaps care not to), or whether they have the tools and the will to effectively  (probably violently) bend the crowd to their desires.
Most likely is some incomplete measure of control, which make outcomes uncertain and tactics varied.  A very messy process, but then people and life are messy things, most of the time.

        The alt right is enjoying the attention they are receiving. Between the anime hitler avatars and nagger jokes, there are legitimate points of view that will rise to the surface and continue to shift the overton window. Possibly in time for the big election next year.
