        I read a thread on Twitter that hit it out of the park, Understand what time it is in America.I have said for decades the hard left will do anything to win, including stealing an election, jailing the opposition and even murder.  People rolled their eyes.After Obama got elected I said he was going to spread the model of Chicago politics nationally which includes stealing elections, jailing the opposition and murder.  People rolled their eyes.I said the Democrat party was taking its cues from Goebbels.  People rolled their eyes.I said Trump was the last hurrah, when his term is finished leftist hell will be unleashed. People rolled their eyes.I told people I changed from Republican to Independent and permanently closed Facebook because Republicans will be hunted.  They rolled their eyes.There is no one fighting for you. There is no one fighting for your children.  You live in a Nazified style oligarchy and it is not going to get better. If the 2024 election is lost they will accelerate the persecution. If it is won it will only be a temporary and partial reprieve.And just yesterday, Hillary Clinton called for the mass reeducation of Republicans. This is not hyperbole, it is Amerika 2023. If they can find a way, they will open camps, be it for another covid, or any excuse the sheep will support.It is time to make your plan of escape.From Twitter:@robbystarbuckUnderstand what time it is in America:• Trump is being prosecuted by Biden’s regime + multiple state level Democrats• Every agency in government has been weaponized to investigate because he’s trying to level the playing field online to empower citizens• Newsweek just broke the story that the FBI is both investigating Trump voters and treating them like terrorists by using the same types of tools they used against ISIS• DHS and CISA used proxies to censor influencers like me and for opposing Democrats too effectively • Grandma’s (including one with cancer) who thought they were allowed in the Capitol after police waved them in were thrown in prison over January 6th despite zero violence• Soros DA’s are releasing pedophiles and criminals to carry out record crime• Over 7 MILLION illegal immigrants have entered our country under Biden — Only 14 states have populations &gt; 7.4M• Schools are grooming kids about so called social justice, gender identity and sexual topics (including books with porn in them) while hiding all of it from parents• People fear saying they vote Republican despite Republicans winning the 2022 popular vote because they know they can lose their jobs over it or be ostracized• Doctors are giving kids sex changes with the full support of the White House including on children of our troops• Doctors lose their licenses over disagreeing with the narrative of the Democrats• Banks, Big Tech and online transaction services have banned prominent influencers for the crime of being conservative• Inflation and interest rates are destroying our economy in ways that we’ll be dealing with for over a decade • 80-90% of Congress represent their own interests and lobbyists instead of people• Big Tech companies manipulate what the public sees to sell the Democrats narrative• Soldiers were fired by the thousands for being conservatives who didn’t want the COVID jab — They even denied chaplains religious exemptions• People are put through public struggle sessions if they say men can’t be women• The DOJ and Democrat DA’s are deploying lawfare to bankrupt prominent Trump officials and supporters — “the process is the punishment”• College kids won’t get into schools if they express any conservative views and many will be failed in classes if professors find out they’re conservative• Parents were treated like terrorists by Merrick Garland and the DOJ for protesting school boards over COVID and the sexualization of children• Professional programs to become doctors and nurses are adding steps to screen for ideology to eliminate conservatives: Many do it in sneaky ways (doctors do this with requirements to get the COVID vax in order to get a residency)• Some states passed laws to take custody from parents who don’t affirm the new gender identity of their kids and even legalized kids running away to their state to get an abortion or sex change• BLM and Antifa members received multi million dollar settlements after burning down cities with riots and looting for a year because they’re modern day brown shirts that the Democrats had to reward to ensure they do it again in the futureOur future is closer to Russia under Stalin, Cuba under Castro, China under Mao or Venezuela under Maduro than we are to the ideals of our constitution. We’re living through the intentional destruction of the country we know and love. Why? Because communism never becomes reality without chaos, destruction and separating kids from their parents.America won’t survive unless Republican politicians get serious and recognize how far down the road to hell we are. It’s not time for Fox News hits where you get the one liner off that you hope to fundraise off of. It’s not time for another hearing that goes nowhere. It’s time to use EVERY lever of power you have to crush these new age communists and yes I mean communists.It’s time to be ruthless.I disagree with his last sentence. The time to be ruthless has passed. We have lost. Look for self defense. Look for escape.

            Yes, we get it, you get to pull a “I totally predicted thith”. So did a lot of people. Now’s not the time to use your tweezers to jerk off about it. The biggest concern should be (for you and all the “predicted thith” folks) – what are you doing to prepare for it?

            “Escape” is not the answer—unless used to reposition one’s self to a better advantage.
There is no escape.  As Templar sagely observes.  Prepare, as in prepare for them when they come for you and yours.

                ““Escape” is not the answer—unless used to reposition one’s self to a better advantage.”
Yeah that’s literally exactly what escape is for.  So it totally is an answer.  The ONLY or CORRECT answer?  Dunno.  Neither do you or anyone else.

            Darn those Democrats!  They’re the real Nazis!
“America won’t survive unless Republican politicians get serious!”
Republican politicians won’t get serious because they are paid to lose by the same people who fund the Democrats.
Consider the possibility the source of our current turmoil is deeper than the ideology of Democrats versus Republicans.
Who funds the uniparty and what do they want?  Their motivation is not ideological but racial.

                There is lots of kick ass footage on Telegram channels like DD Geopolitics and Intel Slava Z.
In terms of numbers there are estimates that the Pals have already destroyed 14 tanks, dropped 4 helos, and inflicted 4 or 500 casualties.

                    Thanks, I’ll check it.
If only Our Greatest Ally had embraced diversity, none of this would have happened given how strong it would have made it. Along those lines, I’m certain Tel Aviv has noticed the traditional boot licking has declined among the American populace.

                Yeah, the U.S. (((media))) is conveniently forgetting to tell you that on Thursday, 800 Jews stormed the al-Aqsa mosque and defiled it by performing Talmudic rituals in it.
Nothing to see here, kids, move along. The Palestinian attack on the innocent Jews happened for NO REASON:

                They would enslave and rape you at their first chance. And they did this to Europeans for many centuries.
With that being said, there is a respect amongst the dissident right for them as well. They move to the West and remain in their own enclaves, retain their culture, and successfully resist being pozzed like Christians have to globohomo. There are lessons to be learned from them.

                        Carl B.:  Neither side is “your people.”  Neither side would support you in your time of need.  Why not say a plague on them both?  Granted, the standard image of the Arabs dancing around with children on their shoulders while waving their rifles in the air is (at least to me) reminiscent of Africans.  As I said, these are an alien and anti-Western people.But so are the Israelis.  They spit on foolish and deluded Christian tourists.  Their crimes against Whites may be a bit more subtle and long-term, but they are just as lethal and share the same goal.Both sides want an end to White people and Western civilization.  They are both my enemy.  Their fight is not our fight.Let it go.  Focus on ensuring a future for your own family and people.

                        This may be a case of “the enemy of my enemy…”.
However, quoting from Netanyahu—“sometimes the enemy of your enemy is still your enemy”.
Perhaps better is from Shakespeare, “a pox on both your houses”.

                    The usual suspect are calling for war on Iran.  Of course by implication that means Syria as well.   So they want war with Russia, China, Iran and Syria.   The neocons with their little brains probably don’t understand that we cannot win a conventional war against any of those countries at this point.If you liked the Iraq and Afghanistan wars then you will love a war with Iran.   Maybe the neocons realize they can’t fight the Russians so they think they can save face by beating up Iran.That would be the military mistake of the century.   It would rival the Roman lost legions disaster.    In any event the government is currently engaged in a war on white people, particularly white men.   So when the war drums get rolling the government should only send minorities and women to their wars from now on.   Let’s see what they can do.  Now is their chance to show us.

                I instinctively recoil from the arabs because they display the same pack animal frenzy that blacks do, but I have to admire the skill and stealth required to plan and carry out the attack.

Impressive.  I’m not defending the subsequent savage behavior.
Although I don’t like the palestineans, our situation resembles theirs.  I hope that we can be as crafty and resourceful.

                    In sportsball idiom, “There is never an upset without a great collapse”
I don’t mean Pearl Harbor takes about self-fragging (both factions inside Israeli gov’t now shamed completely), rather, that Hamas Etc. must have learned from the Mexican cartels that 2023 diverse pink-haired Leviathan has “pies de cerámica.”
But while snaggle-toothed British hacks can instantly spin out Whither Empire and Knock-On Effects press clippings, I think they have fewer inklings about the other “Problem From Hell,” to wit, diverse pink-haired tax-eaters. Honestly I’m unhopeful that Arab desperados have the answer.

        I think Russia withstanding the Empire’s supposedly infallible weapon – economic sanctions – has produced a paradigm shift, as you say.  I remember a similar effect when the Soviet Union failed to conquer Afghanistan in the 1980s.  Up until then, there was a mythos about the Red Army; it seemed to be an inexorable, unstoppable force.  Wherever it went, it overwhelmed its target and then STAYED.  The best we could hope to do was to build moats and barriers around our safe areas, because if they ever breached the defences it was game over.When they failed to hang on to an invaded territory, it was a big shock – they WEREN’T invincible after all!  The defeat didn’t happen all in one day, but when they finally exited Afghanistan, the end of the Soviet Union itself was imminent.  We could be facing a similar collapse on this side now.

More to that quote. Not mentioned, but one might also notice Jewish power is starting to break.

If you think so try uttering the two words “jewish power” in any public forum under your own name… and see how fast you get fired (or worse).

        Another thing that Russia has shown is that Western weapons and military might are grossly overhyped. The U.S. empire has always relied on military force when economic sanctions didn’t do the trick, and most countries rightly feared that. Russia has shown that its cheaper and more reliable weapons are at least the equal of anything the West can offer, and that their industrial base for war is far superior to the West. It’s no accident that the multipolar world is merging a lot faster now, because the empire has been shown to be far weaker than anyone expected.

            This is true of most empires — they expand by beating up on weaker opponents.
The British were pretty impressive when they were shooting nonwhite, primitive Subcontinentals and Zulus… their record was not nearly as successful against Americans, Boers and Germans.

                XMan: “The British were pretty impressive when they were shooting nonwhite, primitive Subcontinentals and Zulus… their record was not nearly as successful against Americans, Boers and Germans.”

                        This is what sober minds call Armageddon.On the only question that mattered in the last century [arguably in the last millennium], the Schizo assessment of the situation was uniformly correct &amp; truthful, whereas the Normie assessment of the situation was catastrophically existentially false &amp; wrong.Your only hope is that utterly insouciant &amp; incompetent Obama voters in the distribution channel were tasked with handling the particular vial, the contents of which were thrust into your very own triceps, and that those Obama Voters had left that particular vial out long enough in the heat of the warehouse for the temperature of the vial to rise above -76F, and thereby destroy the Lipid Nano-Particles.OTOH, if your vial was properly frozen throughout the distribution channel, then you’ve already got Myocarditis.In that case, you will perish from heart disease no later than about 2040 [but probably more like 2030].I’m sorry, Bro.I’m so sorry.You might take a look at Peter McCullough’s “The Wellness Company”, and his two cardiac products:“Signature Series Spike Support Formula” and “Healthy Heart”.McCullough is the only person I know of who is trying to do something proactive for you.Even heart transplants wouldn’t serve any purpose; if the Lipid Nanoparticles did indeed inject their MRNA payloads into formerly symbiotic Eukaryotes, as the Italians suspect, then the formerly symbiotic Eukaryotes would just keep pumping out the Spike Protein, and those Spike Proteins would immediately begin destroying any PureBl00ded heart the surgeons might be able to transplant into you.I suppose if you were a member of the Council of the Sanhedrin, they might be able to arrange for a Purebl00ded shegetz to be kidnapped and de-hearted every five years, to keep you alive, but I can’t imagine anyone in the membership of The Council would have actually subjected themselves to a poisonous v@xxine meant for the goyim, so I don’t foresee any Council Members needing to worry about that.

        It would be good to hear someone with a lot of knowledge do a show on what all happened between Gary Hart getting thrown out of the Dem primary in 1988 and Clinton getting the nomination four years later.  In between the two was Anita Hill which makes the about face on these issues even more abrupt.  AWFLs went crazy defending Hill and then turned around and voted for Bill Clinton 13 months later. James Carville went all in discrediting the Clinton accusers, remember his “this is what you get when you drag $100 bill through a trailer park” line.  1990s AWFLs really believed that generation of Republican leaders were outlaw abortion which shows how insane they were and still are.Other politicians around the same time as Hart either survived scandals or had them ignored by the press. George H.W. Bush had cruelly cheated on Barbara for years up until he ran in 1980 and the story didn’t get widespread attention until long after he left office. You have to wonder if someone gave the press the green light to hit Hart and why they would do that?

            One very notable difference: Hart dropped out. Nobody made him quit (far as I know). Evidently he had shame, unlike Clinton, who just didn’t care.
And if Hart had stayed in, and benefited from a 3rd party guy siphoning votes from Bush like Clinton did, then he too could have won with 43% of the popular vote, just like Clinton.

                Good point, people forget Clinton’s popularity waxed and waned for his two terms and in 1992 the only state where he won 50% of the vote was Arkansas.  There were also a fair number of white Southerns who were easily duped into voting for a ticket they saw as made up of “their guys.” No one in 1988 was getting a significant percent of the vote as a third party.

            That reminds me of a new thing I noticed: Libertarians are the only Democrats who still bring up Bork. Normal Democrats don’t have to remember anything that happened before today, but people pretending not to be Democrats do. Wherever a “right libertarian” thanks the Republicans for keeping Garland off the Court—as if giving a wannabe Beria the job of running the nation’s law enforcement apparatus is better—a Real Libertarian will arise to feign agreement and remind the straying sheep to thank the Democrats for sparing us from Bork, who was just as bad “from the other side.” All but two of the horrors Bork might have inflicted on us—keeping federal drug laws as they *still are* and reversing Roe for “life” rather than procedural reasons—were directly from the contemporary Libertarian Party platform.

            My longstanding assumption is that when a major Democrat goes down in flames, it is because the real puppet-masters want him purged. The Media, under orders, bring down their full weight: so, buh-bye to Jim Wright, Dan Rostenkowski, Gary Hart, John Edwards, Anthony Wiener, maybe Menendez?, Andrew Cuomo…Cuomo is a tell for me, as a subject of the NY State satrapy. During the Covid hysteria, he was riding too high, he was gaining serious national attention; then someone upstairs saw him as a threat, maybe not as manageable as a Biden, who – events show – had already been selected by the big players. He was purged. It wouldn’t surprise me that Elliot Spitzer was purged too, for similar reasons. Clinton is proof-positive that you can be as foul and scummy as you wish (Ted Kennedy waives hello from Hell) provided that you follow instructions from the real players.

            Jeffrey Zoar: “One very notable difference: Hart dropped out. Nobody made him quit (far as I know).”The obvious explanation there is that Hart was not a CIA guy.The CIA had already long since examined &amp; approved the personality profiles of both Bush &amp; Clinton; both were known assets with reliable personalities.But apparently Hart/Hartpence had the wrong personality type.As did Ross Perot.Hart &amp; Perot were personalities which were too unpredictable for the CIA to allow them to get too close to the Throne Room.Clinton’s sojourn in England, monitoring his fellow students for subversive behavior [likely courtesy of J William Fulbright, himself likely a CIA asset] proved that Clinton was a “Team Player”, who had precisely the whorishly slavish personality necessary to receive CIA approval for a run at the presidency.[I just checked Wikipedia, and there’s now something which is literally called a “Fulbright-Clinton Fellowship”.]==========PS: The Old Steve Sailer, the Good Steve Sailer, the Steve Sailer who used to write about this sort of thing, pegged Stanley Armour Dunham as a CIA/DOD intelligence asset who was constantly moving the Dunham family around the nation [and eventually around the world], staying from time to time in the vicinity of DOD installations, for the purpose of hearing gossip about potential military subversion in the bars &amp; clubs &amp; pool halls &amp; card sharking games &amp; whatnot.His wife, Madelyn Payne Dunham, was herself almost certainly a CIA asset [in the financial sector], as were his daughter, Stanley Ann Dunham, and his grandson, Barack Hussein Obama Marshall Davis Dunham Something or Other.==========PS: In case it isn’t abundantly obvious, this is why the CIA panicked when Trump beat Hillary in 2016.Trump failed the Personality Profile Test.Trump’s personality was wildly too unpredictable for the CIA to have allowed him to have had a normal presidency.And Trump’s personality profile is precisely why they’re still trying to destroy him, as we speak.==========The only reason I’m pointing this out is because of my parallel thesis in this thread wherein I’m arguing for us to DITCH THE 20TH-CENTURY-THINK and start understanding reality for what it actually is.Everything we were taught for our entire lives was just one never-ending streams of Lies.And until we cleanse our souls of all the Lies we were taught, we are merely slaves of the Lie-Masters, and their father in hell.

        Yeah I’m pretty sure the Dems let McCarthy dangle because he supported the Biden Impeachment hearings. I think they would have gotten behind him had he not  given the go-ahead.That said, you have to wonder about the system producing all the midwit Republican Congressman we see these days. I mean, Gingrich, Dick Armey, David Stockman and Ron Paul and a whole generation of guys from the post- Reagan Era were giants compared with McCarthy and Scalise and even Jim Jordan, who seems like a good guy but is no intellectual. And Pat McHenry is bright enough, but is wholly owned by Bank of America.I would venture an explanation: As the Corporate Overlords have basically gone Woke and have chosen to co-opt the Democrats, since they obviously have nothing to fear from the GOP, their need for bright, articulate GOP henchmen has plummeted. So the talent has drained out of GOP politics into lobbying, Wall Street and the MIC.

            All this sounds terrifying and true to me. Masks are dropping, and fast. The GOP is nearing or has reached its ‘sell by’ date. Those of us in hostage states such as NY understand that the “2-party system” myth  no longer requires maintenance. Hochal is a monster, of course, but it was Cuomo who declared that all of us ‘deplorables’ not on board with the progressive agenda were not proper New Yorkers; my family, on my father’s side, settled here in the 1800s as farmers, which makes our homeland, right?Wrong! We are aliens and miscreants. New York would be a better state if we just left. That was Cuomo’s stated position. WGH and KGB, among others, will back me on this.

                When Cuomo said there was no place in New York for conservatives he was on to something. More precisely there’s no place in the New York Democrat party for white men.

            China is hurting, because all its customers, the US and EU, are in recession due the sanctions on Russia. Germany is near collapse. on the bright side, nowadays most of China’s is with the Global South.

        44:00 “…they would like to see manufacturing come back… not all of it, you can’t go backwards…”Right now, we’re doing the really low value stuff like cotton and corn and the extremely high value stuff like machinery. But it’s nowhere near enough. We’re running 60 billion Dollar a month trade deficits. 2023 will mark the first time in US history that we will be a net importer of food (though I’m not sure this is $ or tonnage).  We must stop doing this voluntarily or we’re going to stop involuntarily because we will be priced out of the market. Either way, we will stop these massive trade deficits. All the US manufacturing being pulled out of China isn’t being brought home, it’s going to India, Vietnam, Mexico and other foreign countries.These trade deficits are one of the major reasons we have 30 plus trillion Dollars of unpayable debt.  Now it’s not just manufacturing, even Amazon and other retailers are losing to foreign competition.  We have these import bans from certain regions in China. But the ban has the exception of small shipments, which are allowed. So now temu and aliexpress can ship these items to Americans tariff free and bypass the ban. Our retailers cannot import these items and sell them, because they don’t buy 1 or 2 at a time, they buy by the multiple containers. That volume is banned.While there is certainly a lot of Dollar denominated debt that is outside of America, three is a limit to the Dollar market.  Outside of Dollar denominated debt, there is little use for Dollars outside of the US. You can’t buy much with them.  All you can buy is this machinery. Then you can use that machinery to make anything America could theoretically sell you. This is why our land, real estate, stocks and bonds are being bought up. Next time you look at a million Dollar fix-er-uper, blame our gutted industry.

            Reshoring;  your information is inaccurate. There were 364.000 manufacturing jobs reshored to the USA this year alone.
Here’s the link.  I can post a library.

The manufacturing is returning to the USA.
Stop Dooming or at least OverDooming it.Even the Z blog can have good news.

        The gap between the Republican party and Republican party voters continues to grow, and unlike the Dems, they have no way to bring them back. You can tell the Republicans are getting desperate as they are angry that voters are not supporting the politicians (which, of course, is a total inversion of what this system of government is supposed to be) and furious that people are fine with the idea of not passing these massive CRs or shutting down the government or hitting the debt ceiling. .People on the right are happy to see the chaos and want to see Republican scumbag grifters like McCarthy squirm and fail. It’s funny. At the same time, Gaetz says something like, “if you’re worried about paying military veterans, then write a bill paying military veterans”, and that makes intuitive sense. So it’s not just that people want to see the world burn, but that the “outsiders” are just making more sense than the scumbags who are demanding we need to pass this $3T boondoggle that just got finalized 10 minutes ago and if you don’t you are against the soldiers.

            Voters aren’t supporting the politicians?  Could’ve fooled me.  Here in so-called Trump Country, the reddest of the red, not a one of our Congressewes voted to kick McCarthy out.  And Mullins, our junior Senator (indulge me – I can’t bear to put Senator in front of his name), was trotted out by Mitch McConnell to accuse Gaetz of confessing to sins that would make Bob Guccione blush.  After many years of practice performing unnatural acts on Paul Ryan in Congress (heck, he may trot over to Fox once in awhile for old times’ sake), he is now scratching Mitch’s Itch.   Our other senator is a Bush plant from Texas and has won re-election, enough said.Nope, my home state, except for a few rebels like me, appears to be not Trump Country but Establishment Republican Central.

                Taleb talked about this in one of his books, maybe Antifragile. In any situation, the vast majority will go with the flow, that’s just reality. It does not take many people, a tiny significant minority, to make significant changes. I mean, look at the past 10 years – what percentage of people do you think see themselves as “nonbinary” or were “born in the wrong body” and look at what they have done?
In this case, we have an actual number – 8 Republican reps wreaked havoc on the party with 213 on the other, “establishment” side.

        My favorite part is the explanation of the subservience of the republicans to democrats, sucking their dick since the new deal. Not just speakers but senators like McConnell and that traitorous shit McCain. Never fighting to upend and set a new path. Some people thought Reagan was upending the order but was subsumed by the dem control of the house. Honestly wonder where the contry would be if country club shit republicans like romney’s daddy were pushed out of the way and Taft actually got the nom for 40 instead of that loyal opposition scumbag line Wenke.

        Somewhat related to this show, I am now advising any friends/acquaintances to sign up for social security at first eligibility, age 62. You’ll take a significant reduction in monthly benefits compared to what you would receive if you wait, but at this point social security reform is inevitable within the next few years, and it will involve: (1) higher taxes; (2) lower payouts; and (3) higher retirement age requirements. I suspect it may also involve reduced payouts based on income and/or wealth status. It may also involve enhanced payouts or lower retirement age requirements based on diversity goals.If you are already in the system at age 62 you stand a much better chance of being grandfathered into the existing rules, which are going to be far more beneficial to those of us here. If you keep working, then you will lose a portion of your social security benefit, but at this point I believe the benefit of being in the system far outweighs the risk of essentially letting your bet ride on the politicians in DC. Take the money and run.

            Social Security should be means tested and eligibility age raised.  Social Security is not a “problem,” it is a “predicament.”  “Problems” have solutions and can be avoided if detected early enough.  40 years ago, Social Security was still a problem.I believe SS is the main reason for the open borders business. Europe has the same problem.  There are all these unfunded pensions and old ages schemes like SS that are funded from current taxes.  Without massive immigration, there simply are not enough workers to deliver on the promised benefits.  But all these 3rd worlders do not solve the problem, they make the problems worse because they are net tax recipients, not net tax payers.These promises cannot be kept. But totally reneging is not a great idea either.  Plus, the retirement age was set in 1940.  People either lived a long time or they didn’t. They didn’t live for 10 years needing exorbitantly expensive medical treatment to keep them alive.  Far more people died in their 60s or early 70s than today.  America was a much younger nation then too. There were far more workers per retiree than there are today (IIRC, it was 8 vs 2 or 3 today).

                Means testing is a dangerous thing, and here’s why. Like the federal income tax, it would begin by targeting only the very wealthy. It would end by targeting everyone who works for a living (aka white people).Soon, only welfare recipients and brown bodies (but I repeat myself) would be receiving social security benefits.Any white person who advocates for a reduction in social security is playing right into their hands. We should never voluntarily give up our benefits. No other group does. They demand more gibs regardless of the cost.Until we cut foreign aid, welfare for layabouts, health care for illegals, corporate tax gibs, studies into lesbian fatties, etc., we should never let them touch social security. It’s one of the few bennies that white people get.But “be reasonable,” you will say. I submit to you that “being reasonable” is what got us into trouble in the first place. If anything, working white people have been too reasonable. And what have we gotten in return? Nothing but contempt.

                    The anti-white GAE depends on Whites being “reasonable”. The best example of this is affirmative action, they expect Whitey to be “reasonable” and check the “White” box in any government form or job application, even though that relegates him to second-class status (as we saw in that Bloomberg report). The time to be reasonable is over. Social Security is still universal because the recipients and future recipients are extremely unreasonable about this. Likewise, gun advocates keep getting wins in court because they are completely and totally unreasonable, in spite of the opposition that says that “the majority are in favor of reasonable gun legislation.” Once you start trying to figure out “reasonable” with them, you are ensnared in their trap. Note they are never reasonable, about anything.

                    Winter:  Interesting take, and one I hadn’t really considered before.  In general I am opposed to Social Security and any other legacy Ponzi scheme from fdr.  My husband wants me to wait (I have been eligible already for a few years) because most of it would go to taxes due to his current income.  But your points are valid, and you’re right – it is one of the few ‘bennies’ available to Whites.  You’ve made me reconsider my position, although I hate dealing with the fedgov for anything (still dragging my feet on Medicare as well).

                        Bob Sykes:  F**k anything “mandatory.”  Or “for my own good.”  And we’re still checking into the details, since my husband is still working and I’m covered under his health insurance (although we chose a high-deductible HSA to save money instead of the insane monthly cost of the standard ppo).
Yes, it’s all technically ‘my’ money they deducted the years I worked, but the hoops I have to jump through to get it, and the idiot bureaucrats I will have to talk to, and the obscene amount of money it all costs . . .

                        Sykes, unless you know your exact date of “death” you can not make the statement regarding immediate enrollment or waiting until age 70.  As it is now, the typical expected mortality figures for a white woman pretty much balances out the loss of early retirement amount.  Of course, you can make a judgement as to your own health and life expectancy.
What you do gain is that the surviving spouse will get to choose between the higher of the two SSI checks.

                    I’m not saying to be reasonable. I’m saying SS will collapse if it is not reformed. If it’s collapsed, nobody gets it.  This would leave a lot of White seniors, who paid into it all their lives, destitute and living in abject poverty.There are negatives to means testing Social Security and I have serious doubts that the government can do this well.  However, you act like the choice is means test and cheat whitey out of his benefits or don’t and help whitey.  That isn’t the choice being presented.  The choice is reform it or it collapses.The government spent all the money. It’s not there anymore.  The “trust fund” is accounting fraud. It is backed with government bonds.

                        Again and yet again (it seems like forever), I am correcting this group wrt SSI.  Really folk, simply read the law or visit the SSI website.Tars you are only partially correct—and that’s being generous.  SSI has a source of funding—employee’s currently working!  Yes, their deductions (SSI’s current income) does not fully cover (pay out) what is currently allotted as benefits, hence the monthly dip into the trust fund for the difference.Trust fund? There is no trust fund Tars says.  Yes there is, it’s T-Bills!  SSI cashes in whatever they need at the end of the month.  This fund is what is often referred to as running out by 2030 or whenever (it varies as the cash outlays/inputs vary).  Of course, this de facto means SSI is bankrupt since the Fed’s must sell T-bills (to other suckers) to raise the money to pay off SSI’s cash out.How long does this go on?  Until the trust fund (T-Bills) runs out or no one buys T-bills any longer.  Then by law *all* payouts are reduced across the board proportionally to match SSI revenue from employed workers!I’n short, everyone takes a “haircut”.  This haircut is currently estimated at 23-25%.  So if you get a $2k check monthly, you might get a $1,500 check.Should one feel comfortable?  Well no.  If Congress is in session, no one should feel comfortable.  Congress could rearrange the payment/benefit schedule to hold the bottom of the payment recipients harmless and reduce payouts to the higher income folk to subsidize them.  They also might raise retirement age levels and contributions for those still working.  Look for a combination of all simultaneously as to confuse those being screwed the most.Finally, if one looks, one quickly finds that SSI is not a retirement plan in the sense one thinks of.  It is designed as a supplement and even SSI—there’s that website again—cautions against planning on SSI to account for more than 30-40% of one’s retirement needs.Folks in this group should already know that and even a 100% reduction should not equate to one living on the street.  Plan accordingly.

        ‘U.S. Will Build Stretch of Border Wall and Begin Deportations to Venezuela’https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/us/biden-border-wall-waiver.htmlThis is a feint.The latest hand-wringing coming from mayors in the big cities up north is all for show.

No. This is more political kabuki theater orchestrated by the Left. Re-starting a pithy section of the border wall? More theater.THEY DON’T CARE.“Why do you say that?”Simple Machiavellian/Sun Tzu/ or name your favorite strategist tactics are headed our way. What will probably happen will be some light, meaningless concessions that MSM and Leftist Pols will tout to the heavens as a part of their make-believe solution to the manufactured crisis they created.Don’t misunderstand, they aren’t experts in 4-D chess, this is more of the ‘Never let a crisis go to waste’ mentality.Think Federal imaginary dollars funneled into surrounding states to help spread the migrants around. To be sure, the towns and cities designated will be in rural areas that could use some more diversity as our ruling class desires.Does anyone still believe that the GOP/RINO loyal opposition are going to fight the Prog-Left wing of their bifactionary R/D uniparty? No.

So much money and effort has gone into it that’s it’s hard to reckon what would’ve happened organically.If, otoh, the policy is a symptom of GAE’s collapse, we’re as screwed as the Romans were.I’m not sure which case is true, but being that our rulers almost unanimously hate us, and being that the policy benefits various shortsighted interests, I lean towards the former. Also, being the product of shortsightedness, one might reasonably expect it to be short lived.Going out on a limb with that, but I don’t feel too badly about it lol.

            Our rulers did actually believe, for a long time, that an expanding population meant an expanding economy meant more prosperity for all. On top of that, our rulers believed in “magic soil” theory. Or that being in the presence of whites (er, I mean living in a Democracy!) or operating under white systems (er, I mean practicing Liberalism!) made everyone effectively white.Lefties say that white supremacy is non-white people suffering under a white-built system, but it is in fact the opposite: white people graciously offering their life-ways to non-whites and then expecting non-whites to magically act like Bob and Nancy from Des Moines. The fact that this does in fact happen – I know plenty of non-whites who act just like I do – only reinforces the liberal democratic project.Even though, as we all know, at a certain number group differences become apparent. This is the blind spot, and this will end the GAE.

                Those ideas have been around since Babel, and they’ll end the same way. Whites’ graciousness turns out to be pride, and Pride goeth before destruction, an haughty spirit before a fall. Or something like that lol.

        My contribution to the Black Pill Friday podcast is that even Dan Bongino is starting to crack. He is now full-on F-bomb expletives all the time, ranting that the police state is already here, and that if Trump is not elected in 2024 all is lost. He acknowledges that the national debt bomb will likely explode next year when short term Treasury Bills must be rolled over at significantly higher interest rates. Can the Fed bail them out once again by printing endless fiat? No way or hyperinflation. Take your pick.The first domino fell in Slovakia with the election of a sane president. Soon it will be Poland’s turn. What does the GAE have up its sleeve to stem the tide? Flashpoint on the horizon. False-flag in the wings. WW3?May you live in interesting times.

            Bongino is part of the Irish Right. (Or if you will, the Irish-Italian right, AKA the populist right. Beck, Bannon, Bongino, you get it.) At some point, they all go bonkers. They think voting for the guy who fires guns in campaign commercials will save us. Then they think that if enough outrage is generated, there will be a people’s revolt worthy of Norman Rockwell. When none of this comes to pass, they start getting apocalyptic. Because they don’t see a way through except via Christ or QAnon.

        Interesting times indeed. Between the rapid decline of the American empire, and the complete and utter irrelevance of Europe, it will all be turned over to the globalists soon enough.Forty-plus years of liberal immigration policies and refugee ideology have tipped the demographic balance which will forever change the faces and politics in the west. Our so called “social contracts” are practically meaningless on all levels of society.Sweden and Norway currently lead the way for cashless societies while Italy is already experimenting with a watered down form of social credits. World governments used the pandemic to test their ability to suspend human rights, shut down businesses and impose martial law on a global scale as never before seen in human history.Connect the dots. It’s all a primer for what lies ahead.It’s not a question of “if” it will end badly, but “when”. And that “when” is approaching faster than a Maui wildfire – with a similar outcome.

            If Germany had a real leader who would put their country first he/she might save the entire world.   A good leader would get on a plane to Russia and make a deal with Putin.   Rebuild the NS Pipeline and ask the U.S. Military to go back to France or Britain.
The U.S. committed a catastrophic act of war on Germany.  The German people should not forget that.

                America and the allies did what they had to do. We all understand that.The current situation across Europe was a well orchestrated and mutually agreed to suicide that started shortly after the war ended. It’s nothing new, but only new to people who don’t know the history of European immigration.Germany encouraged 14 million guest workers from Italy and Turkey to come here and help rebuilt the country but never forced them go return.France and the UK are victims of their own colonization as they invited their commonwealth citizens to bring their culture and religions to the mother country. They couldn’t sent them back if they wanted to.Of course Frau Merkle got a bad rap, for obvious reasons, but even the 1.1 million that showed up in 2015 was drop in the bucket when you add up the total numbers that have been repopulating from that original 14 million that came here 70-years ago.

                    Karl Horst:  There is ample blame to go around, but I have read that Germany was quite reluctant to invite in Turkish guest workers after the war, correctly protesting that they were too inherently different.  The US was insistent, however, and saw it as a means of keeping Turkey a happy member of the ‘west’ in good standing.  And even then, the US doing the encouraging was heavy on a certain group of people who had filled the Roosevelt administration.

The USA of WW2? Ok, I get it: We all hate and reject the American mythos, the “Greatest Generation” bullshit, etc. But “it should live in shame?” Why? Can you tell me which major country in that war should NOT live in shame? Are you saying – as Coughlin did, and Lindbergh (who changed his mind, by the way) – that fighting the Germans was a bad idea?

                    “America and the allies did what they had to do. We all understand that.”Bullshit. America allied itself with the communist Soviet Union of Josef Stalin to destroy and occupy a country that never did and never could attack it. America allied itself with the monster Josef Stalin to take down a democratically-elected German leader who was trying to save his people from Bolshevism and to reunite a country that had been partitioned at Versailles.I know it’s probably illegal in Germany for you to admit that, so I don’t expect you to agree, but the facts are the facts.The United States should have continued to adhere to the Monroe Doctrine and stayed the hell out of World War I. Had it done that, there would have been no World War II.

As for the rest of it, true, but he was still evil in other ways, even if only a runner-up compared with the Red Monster.It’s very unfortunate we had to ally ourselves with the Commie regime, but it took both American and Soviet might to overcome the totalitarian-based Nazi aggression.

        The millenials who will be from, “the elite”, who will be positioned to do something, will not have a clue as to why what is happening is happening. It isn’t just that the boomers didn’t develop a bench. It is that they did develop a bench. They developed more ardent and delusioned social cause warriors and spineless individualists pursuing their own self interest to the point that they act against it. Moreover, those who played by the rules of the upward mobility escalator, and in some cases bubble economy wealth transfer rocket, will have never known an economic system based on reality, and their success will be wholly due to the broken system that they rode to great success. In other words, they will be trapped inside the successful Boomer’s bubble with no ability to see outside of it. They will double and triple down.I think prepared GenXers and the tiny cohort of awakened Millenials and Zoomers may have a window of opportunity. Let’s see.

        Spectacular show, Z!
I am a Canadian and don’t know the ins and outs of American politics… but that gong show with your house speaker left me vapour locked. To me it has the feel and atmosphere of a “beer hall putsch”. But then again it’s been feeling awfully 1939-ish for the last couple years.
Something is going to give.
Soon.

            Not really. It’s much, much less of an event than a PM losing a confidence vote in the Commons, because the PM is both the party leader and the executive.
The putsch is a bad example, it happened in 1923, not 1939 and Uncle A went to prison for it.

                Yes I suppose you’re right X. I just feel that it was an event signalling a huge tectonic shift is imminent… like the remors that come before a major eruption or earthquake.
I look at it this way: I think of how PISSED OFF A I am with the left… and I am pretty easy-going by nature. I’m betting that on the rage spectrum, I’m probably right in the middle. Those to the left of me are just starting to Notice Things. Those to the right are probably planning targeted assassinations and drawing up accountability lists…

                    I get that people are pissed off, but the brilliance of the American system is that it diffuses power so much that people can vent their frustrations without making the entire government fall as can happen in parliamentary systems. Not so much in Canada’s Westminster system, but in multiparty parliamentary systems you can have fragile governments that continually fall again and again when no majority coalition is possible. You saw this in France in the 1950s, and you see it in places like Italy. Small parties of unhinged radicals can hold a coalition hostage to their demands.I am 100% totally good with Gaetz &amp; Co. overthrowing the shitbag McCarthy. But unlike a parliamentary system, the senate, the courts and the executive remain unaffected by it. Although we have never had a sitting speaker dumped by a vote of his own caucus, we have had plenty of powerful speakers upset — Jim Wright, Tom Foley, Newt Gingrich.The American system was designed to be intentionally diffuse and centrist, you get to send a message to the bastards without having to man the barricades every time.Of course the system was never intended to have a permanent, unaccountable Deep State bureaucracy financed by $33 trillion in debt, either.BTW I live 20 miles from the Canadian border, I remember well when Canada was the land of tough white guys like Gordie Howe and Guy Lafleur. Sad what it has become today. I hear that even Manitoba has just elected some left-wing Indian nutjob as Premier.

        GAE coming to an end indeed.   Assad just completed a visit to China.   He was given close to a hero’s welcome.    Syria will no doubt be part of the belt and road initiative together with Iran.    BRICS plus membership soon.Since it will be difficult for Erdogan to do without the Chinese at this point, I suspect he will have little choice but to at least partially calm tensions with Syria.    Not working out at all like Mr. Netanyahu had hoped.   I guess the quality of their vassal states is not what it used to be.The Kagan cult must be furious.   Look what their 20 year plus foreign policy of war first has gotten them.    Eventually a military alliance of:  Russia, China, Iran, Syria, N. Korea and possibly Saudi Arabia and maybe others.If the U.S./NATO foolishly escalate to WWIII in Ukraine there will for sure be a Syria front in the war.

                Never underestimate your enemies.  She sounded quite sane as I heard her.  Often such people are used to float “trial balloons”.  They move the Overton Window sort to speak.  This gives cover/rationale for enforcement of such recommendations.  Enforcement being increased scrutiny of MAGA affiliated groups of folk, followed by prosecution for seditious activities—probably initiated by FBI plants.What I heard her say was even more inclusive than just MAGA in that she segued into election denial and such.  In other words,  if you’re in any way critical of the last couple of elections, you are an extremist and a danger to our “democracy”.  This is very reminiscent of the 50’s communist scare tactics, which by the way were abetted by industry/media using “black lists”.  I see no reason this can’t happen again.Today, we are the communists.

                    What has been going on in America for roughly the past 30 years puts the Red Scare to shame. We have long been beset by literally hundreds of thousands of anti-white Joe McCarthys and they’re in command of every node of power in the country. Joe McCarthy never had such control.

                        Quite right, OK. The so-called “Red Scare” was based on real events. Despite the antihistory promulgated by leftist academics that the whole thing was ginned up in the bigoted minds of the Birchers and the Midwestern rubes, it’s not as if the Rosenbergs didn’t actually give the USSR the nuclear secrets, and the Communists hadn’t actually taken China and Korea and actually tried to take Greece.

                    Yeah, but a black list of 75 million people? Plus their families, which might push the figure to 150 million?To achieve a complete solution to the MAGA problem would require either nuclear weapons or some aerosol-delivered pathogen of 100% mortality. Maybe something along the lines of those bubonic plagues cooked up and deposited on Chinese villages by the Brain Trust at Unit 731. It’s not like the USG doesn’t have all this information or that it hasn’t refined it at Ft Dietrick or in some labs in Ukraine, China, etc.Which will work fine, but first, arresting, transporting, concentrating these millions into suitable prison pens for elimination. That is a logistical difficulty. There are no longer enough boxcars and railroads in the continental US to accomplish this efficiently.

                    Always good advice, C. But what we have to remember is that as chaotic as things are on the right…they’re ten times worse on the left. They have never really been punched in the face before, over there either. They are alienating themselves from more people every day.I had to laugh… the other day Putler told Klaus Straub that he was a terrorist POS and that his days were numbered. Do not sell us short… we are very VERY powerful enemies to make too. Cankles, Obutthole, Biden… they are all just a caress of the trigger away from assuming ambient temp if they push it. The only reason Cankles is still breathing is because she’s not relevant. If she does become a clear and present danger… she can be put on a list too. I will bet she already is.

                Read the “Militia” amendment with a careful eye. It says that the ruling class, aka a “free State”, won’t deprive itself the use of the organizations which were effectively centralized by Articles I and II. The idea that it protects petulant gun nuts with private arsenals is merely read into it, mostly by chumps who believe the big lies told in the Declaration of Independence and the preamble. The imperialists who conceded to the “Militia” amendment took care to allow text which could serve their interests. This is why the USA has a “National Guard” which stands ready to be called into action pretty much wherever the military goes on this spheroidal world. If the 2nd am. meant what gun nuts think it does, it would have stripped the imperial gov of control over state militias and mentioned that militias are necessary for a free people, not for the protection of “a free State”. Expect the bipartisan party to seize upon this distinction and to plan accordingly to put down uppity, seditious rubes who refuse to learn their lesson by peaceful instruction.

        Your observations are especially interesting given the absolutely vapid effort the GOP is putting into it’s presidential campaign effort, vapid to the point that an East Indian and a fat guy from New Jersey got their fingers rapped by the pussies in the party when they openly wondered what the point of the exercise was.  I mean if they have trouble keeping an absolute tool like Chris Christie on script then party disintegration is imminent (hopefully).

        Hakeem Jeffries is like Barack Obama: a hate-filled lawn jockey who does what ol’ massa tells him to do. For whatever reason, the actual Establishment that runs the Empire and makesJeffries dance wanted McCarthy taken out. Are they looking for an off-ramp for Ukraine? Just throwing that out–maybe they want to cut off the Ukraine funds and blame the GOP for the Russian victory. Also, Jeffries did reach out to his friends across the aisle to his. Gaetz is the future of the Republican Party, which doesn’t have much of a one, as it transitions into a populist white minority party for whatever time the nation has left.The United States, separate from the GAE, doesn’t have much of a future, either. There is lots of back and forth here about how long that is, and while we don’t know and it could be decades, a sudden, Soviet-style implosion cannot be ruled out due to the economic decline. The D.C.-based war machine actually could linger longer than the former country where it sits.As you point out, the long-term lesson of the Ukraine War is that the world no longer is beholden to the Western economies. I personally think the war was aimed at keeping Europe within the GAE and to a lesser extent putting the screws further to Heritage America and consolidating control over both. If that read is correct, it came at a very high price.For a preview of what is intended for us, take a look at not so much the criminal prosecution of Trump but the intended seizure of his fortune. As whites decline in number and America becomes poorer and poorer, the assorted other tribes still will demand gibs and Heritage America is scheduled to be strip-mined. That is when the ongoing dissolution and fragmentation will leave to an exodus from the country, de facto at first, de jure as the years go by. You even can argue the de facto separation has started.

            I think Putin caught Washington with its pants down the way he caught the global Amero-Judeo plutocrats with theirs down.I agree with your closing part and the inevitable transition of the Republican party. The most significant story of the recent days was Biden giving a report and a political dual speak, promise/threat to his backers at ProPubblica and any dissenters from the dispossessed majority. The most significant issue before Congress from our perspective is Tuberville’s suspension of the JCOS nomination. Tuberville knows the stakes and is to be lauded for it. If that nomination goes through, the armed forces will be purged to help whoever backs Biden make good on his promise/threat.

                With respect, that purge will not be necessary. Obama purged the military brass thoroughly and replaced them with Obama loyalists, most of whom are still there. Trump’s fatal error was failing to purge the government that had been stacked with Obama loyalists, beginning with the military.In 2016 I told my wife that if Trump didn’t purge the government he would end up in prison, exiled, or dead. I’m no genius. If it was obvious to me I can’t fathom how Trump missed it.Vox Day has been dismissive of Trump for failing to cross the Rubicon, but that is the big difference between Caesar and Trump. Caesar had an army. Trump did not, and therefore he was doomed.

            Regarding McCarthy, I am reminded of a scene on the original Godfather, a conversation between Frankie Five Angels, who was in protective custody for potentially being a witness against Michael Corleone, and he has a visit from the Corleone consigliere Tom Hagen, and they discuss hypothetically, when a Roman Senator has erred, he is allowed to honorably “open his veins” and his family can keep their estates. This sounds like McCarthy, he was used then allowed to depart intact.

            Jack: Excellent and frighteningly prescient comment.  It really is up to us to connect the dots, to combine the regime’s seemingly random and obscure pronouncements and predict their intended actions.  I saw that Hilary headline.  Sure, maybe they’re just using her to float a trial balloon, but you know that they regard us as either ignorant rubes or dangerous, inbred notsees.  We also know they’ve been experimenting with drugs that they claim have made conservatives more liberal thinking.https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-created-a-drug-that-makes-people-more-compassionateI also saw that juice judge’s strategy and intent to seize Trump’s property under asset forfeiture.  My husband doesn’t think they will go that far.  I would say Trump didn’t think they would either – but here we are.  Nothing is off the table with a psychotic and monomaniacal regime.

                I suspect asset seizures will become commonplace in leftwing jurisdictions in the near future and attempts to nationalize them for various “infractions” will start real friction with states that resist enforcement orders. I wish your husband were right. He isn’t. The problem will be less ham-handed that outright grabbing in most instances but the end game will be the same: they take, laughing at anyone who believes the Fifth Amendment or any law is still a thing.People also need to be cognizant of where investment firms and so forth are headquartered and think along those lines. Property seizures become more difficult without interstate cooperation. My guess is the Trump situation, for example, is about to lead to even more capital flight out of New York state and Albany will respond with aggressive measures in retaliation to try to claw back the money.I also suspect the true objective behind digital currency (which we have in part already) is replacement of fiat at a greatly devalued worth. Even if that is wrong, and I would like to see what those far more familiar think, actions along those lines are the future. The people responsible for throwing the border open expect us to pay for the detritus that comes across.As for Clinton, she is a sociopath. She simply cannot contain her glee with the thought of murdering or imprisoning those who voted against her. How much State approval she has is unknown but it is quite possible the information from her is accurate.

            Yes. This indicates the actual Establishment, which does not include the GOP other than as a Potemkin opposition, made the decision to take out McCarthy. I don’t know the reason, but speculate it may be to provide an off-ramp for the Ukraine insanity and grift.

            That does make for interesting speculation.  Maybe the establishment saw McC as damaged goods, so need to replace him with another goy who is more presentable.  While the Dems were OK to get rid of him, doesn’t mean they would support a real replacement. And with only 12 (was it?) “Rebel” Rs, doesn’t look like much will change.

        The republicans are kind of like the Palestinians — they’re damned if they do and equally damned if they don’t.  If they upset the apple cart by  replacing the speaker, there’s this big hue and cry from the establishment right like the WSJ and NY post, as well as the left, about how the move will be seen as extremist and damage what’s left of the republican brand.  If they do nothing it’s business as usual.  It’s tough to do much when every institution in the nation is against you.

            Failure is funny that way.  Sometimes there is no “winning” solution.  You have two options, accede to your enemies and fail—or fight your enemies and fail.  I believe the public (me anyway) is tired of failure to fight.  I can accept loss if I see a good fight.Never have I believed more in the old adage:  “Dem’s want change yesterday, Rep’s want it in two weeks.”  😉What we are seeing here is a desperate attempt for the Rep’s to maintain their position of “Washington Generals” to the Dem’s position of “Harlem Globetrotters”.  Hence the term we hear to describe the current situation, “uniparty”.

        “As the millennials are taking over, the Global American Empire is coming to an end.”
Throwing out a potential white pill, the end of the Cold War was a moment of tremendous optimism. 30 years later, it’s soured completely.
Maybe the end of GAE, looking like THE END, turns out OK. I realize that sounds incredible, but saying we were marching into dystopia, I imagine, was just as incredible back in the 90s.

                    I have a LOT of problems with the politics of the book, but THE FUTURE IS HISTORY by Masha Gessen really is a brilliant look at Russia in the immediate aftermath of the Soviet Union. The novel is better than the histories along with the contemporaneous news accounts I have read. The story is seen through the eyes of ordinary people who are trying to survive day to day life in the rank gangsterism that erupted under Yeltsin. While not the author’s intent AT ALL, the novel explains why Russians hold Putin in such high regard and why they justifiably hated many aspects of the GAE even before the Ukraine war. It inadvertently is a great history.

                    Yes. They are fools sitting on a foggy night in a forest patting themselves on the back for being so cool and edgy for a midnight glass of wine beneath the moon. They sit smack dab in a den shared by jackals, hyenas and rabid stray dogs.

                        That’s the funny part.  Most of the white liberals believe that they have support and love of the non-whites and the non-whites will spare them from their wrath.  They are in for a very unpleasant surprise.A liberal white friend of mine was defending a liberal white chick that we both know after I had harshly criticized her for her support of anti-white causes.  The argument ended when I said, “there is no group that black women hate more than liberal white women.”  He was speechless because he knew it was true but he was too much of a brainwashed pussy to admit it to himself.

        One thing I think is sus af about the dissident right…
They loves to promote how the empire is ending, right after complying with the empire’s **global** enforcement to lockdown, mask up, and vaxx (to varying degrees of participation, but a majority of such, on the right, respectively).
At least that’s the unified narrative for this audience. How many here would support Thiel/Yarvin for our next aristocratic techno God-emperors?

                Tough to say what’s going on with the health hysteria. A good part of it came from Alex Jones, who’s clearly a poison-the-well type figure. I wouldn’t be surprised if half the viral freakout on the right from his show “leaking it” was astroturfed too.
They’re probably just flexing how they can do it all again when they want. Plus get the right upset over nothing happening so when it comes again they’re sapped of energy already. Common tactic in info control.

                Many people, me included, despaired when we saw how quickly the cowards among us fell into line over Covid. It wasn’t all downside, though. Many states flipped off the federal government, and some local jurisdictions even flipped off their state governments. That scared them, and it should have. I imagine the trial balloons for Covid, the Sequel got shot down pretty quickly. If there was a silver lining with Covid, the response increased the many schisms in society.

                    I don’t totally disagree but you’re delusional. “Free red states” is a counter narrative to keep you in-line as we march forward. Conservatives, including here, who believe in “free red states” are part of the problem.

        “The thing not getting enough attention is the fact that the Democrats were willing to let him swing rather than cut a deal.”
A Republican Speaker who retained his Speakership on account of Democratic support would be seen as a fraud. Yeah, I know, McCarthy already was that, but he was only worth saving if he could help keep up the pretense. McCarthy was, to the end, willing to sell out, but the day came that he was no longer worth buying, which is the eventual fate of the GOP.

            Wasn’t the rumor that Pelosi was going to back McCarthy if he let her keep her office?  Seems petty, but also believable.
If they were even slightly clever they could have swung it though, let a dozen “purple” Dems peel off to support McCarthy in order to protect “Our Democracy™” from radical MAGA terrorists in the GOP, etc.

                Musically, my favorite Randy Newman song; but damn, he paints with a very broad brush! Baltimore was slipping in the 1970s, for sure, but in this song Newman – an LA guy, after all – makes Baltimore sound like Calcutta. In those faraway days, I – an Oriole fan – used to drive (often alone) into the ‘hood around old Memorial Stadium from DC for night games, and never had a problem with anyone; they played “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” at the 7th inning stretch. Sometimes I’d park in a guy’s front lawn for $5 to avoid the stupid, phalanx-style parking at the stadium. I was young, I was naive, but when that Newman song came out I was like, “Fuck, this should be a song about Cleveland or Camden NJ; I like Baltimore!”All that said, I wouldn’t drive today into Baltimore even to go to the Inner Harbor, or Camden Yards. Times change, and one gets old and more timid (or smart).

        McCarthy did have the Speaker’s suite of offices. Pelosi had a hideaway office, not sure which floor in the Capitol, but as you know, those are unmarked (often have oddly-shaped wooden doors, leading one to believe it’s a janitor’s closet), and usually only the top 25 or so members of Congress have them. That’s where the real business used to be conducted when I was up on the Hill. That’s what they took away from her.

            Frank Luntz is his roommate, by the way. And Renee Ellmers was the promising congresswoman from Virginia whom McCarthy had an affair with (before MTG) and when it started getting around back channels, she retired.

        The generational churn angle probably explain a lot of current politics. As a “boomer”, I have watched my contemporaries wreck much of what was good in the society we inherited. Now, in our declining years, many refuse to let go of the powers and privileges they earned in the harshly competitive social environment they lived through.  However, our time is over. To all my fellow boomers, especially those claiming “it’s my turn”, I say, in the words of Oliver Cromwell:“You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go.”

            GenXers were proto-millenials.  They were all in in feminism and diversity.    Hostile to the ( white) man like boomers.

                About half right.
The partial (there aren’t many of us) boomer-to-X generational change in the management of America and its satrapies was the shift from “liberation” and NAMBLA to genocidal anti-whiteness and child eunuchry. Civil rights—conservatives can’t say “Jewish lawyers”—didn’t bring us “wokeness.” A generation of maladjusted psychos, many of them my friends and colleagues, did. The glaring clue is the official uniform: blue-haired, poorly tattooed, crookedly pierced, etc. That’s *our* yearbook.
Millennials are retarded children imitating our “innovations” with heightened emotion. They’re not merely post-philosophical, as we are. They have a strictly maintained *anti-capacity* for thought.

            “My fellow GenXrs are always the bridesmaid never the bride. Meh, they can have it.”
Screw that. Speaking as a fellow Gen-X, we’re the only generation with the historic perspective to realize what went wrong, but tough enough to consider strong solutions. Sure, it’s probably a losing battle, but I still say we’re the best contender out there, generation-wise.
This is nothing against later generations. They’re getting royally screwed by the system, and many of them don’t even realize it because they’ve been awash in intense, anti-white, pro-deviant propaganda for all of their lives.

                Maybe… but one of the strong solutions we’ve considered is raising rock hard kids.  It took a lot of us years to see through the nonsense, plenty of kids now know the deal as early as they can talk.
This is the cadre and the future

            Right?
Today I saw an article titled, “Why Millennials are Destined to be the Forgotten Generation”
They can’t even permit us (de)GenXrs to have that distinction.

        “Say one thing and do another”.And in many cases, the exact opposite!!I confess I haven’t listened yet, but I got warm and fuzzy when that asshat got bounced. Will it mean anything? Who knows, but at least SOMEONE said NO!That’s a big reason why we are in the state we are in.Open border? NOContinuing resolutions? NOHairy guys in dresses can us the girls room? NOFolks (and people) can steal at will? NOI’m glad he’s gone. As for Orange Man being speaker, while that would be “entertaining “, I don’t think it’s gonna happen.

            BOM as SoH would be, [sorry B&amp;B] the Greatest Show on Earth–evah!!!.  The carny metaphor Z writes so much on, fully realized.  The yin, the yang of all carny.

            “Say one thing and do another”.
Next step: “Say one thing, do nothing.”
Maybe in another 30 years we’ll move up to “say one thing, do one tenth of it.”  TBF, doing one tenth of what Vivek’s saying would be a vast improvement.
