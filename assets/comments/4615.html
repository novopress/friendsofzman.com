        TANSTAFL – The price of entry into the internet isn’t officially high.  So instead, the Circle of Jerks (a Redstatism) imposing artificial tolls and barriers to entry such as these spam and pop-up ads.

        The lack of violence in the modern world allows jerkism to thrive. Jerks do not understand reason, logic or common sense. They only understand a thumb pressed tightly against the carotid artery slowly restricting their blood flow to the brain. They also respond quickly to a swift boot to either the solar plexus or the perineum.
It may sound harsh but violence exists for a reason and that reason is to control those that god was putting together at 4:30pm on a Friday afternoon whilst he was thinking about football, beers and grilling sacred cow.

            I suspect you’re right. This morning, a young fellow walks into our office wanting to know if he can speak to the person who handles the copier. This happens a few times a week. They also call a few times a week. In a better time, the risk of physical harm would tamp this down. But, there’s no cost to be an annoying dickhead these days.

        […] In the standard version of the Tragedy of the Commons, there are more takers than givers, and eventually the system breaks down. If this sounds like a bunch of jerks to you, the Z Man can show you more of them: […]

        You learn that in the military, if you enlist young. There’s always about 10% who don’t get the word. That translates, in my lexicon, as 10% of everybody is a jerk. Which is a metric shitload of jerks.

        With you on this issue.  No Breitbart, no Hot Air, and several other sites due to the aggressive advertising.  There are enough no/low ad sites to keep me informed.  As soon as a pop up presents I click off.  If auto play intrudes, click off.  I also make it a point to not buy products from advertising abusers.  Years ago I got fed up with the obnoxious “Toyota-thon” ads and vowed to never by a Toyota and I never have.  Small loss for Toyota but Volkswagen, with their quiet, thoughtful ads captured my vehicle dollars.

        Of course, one of reasons that this is an ‘epidemic’ that needs to be looked at, is because advertisers evidently believe they have a right to force you to look at their ad.

        PJ Media. I miss out on Fernandez, and Hansen. Love those guys but PJM is a worst offender. It crashes Firefox almost every time.
