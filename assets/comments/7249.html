        McAuliffe’s purpose in restoring felons’ right to vote is primarily that they’ll be on the voter rolls, and democrat operatives will find a way to cast a votes for Hillary in their names.

        The truth is that most people should not have the franchise. I’ll trade the convict vote for all who receive government assistance, all who are employed by government–fed, state, local, public schoolteachers, etc. In other words, single women. But offending males must of course be included with the flock.

        The problem, of course, is in your last paragraph.  In theory, few have strong objections to minor offenders being allowed to vote after serving their time; however, rapist, murderers and, especially, pedophiles will draw that objection.  The people on the Left, such as McAuliffe, will never draw that line since, as you note,they assume all ex-cons will vote D.  This is not a legitimate attempt to restore anyone’s civil rights.  It is a naked political grasp at yet more power.  If that means courting the support of child rapers, then so be it.  Any port in a storm, so to speak.

        I would say the real issue here is that voter fraud just got easier for the left. All of a sudden here come a bunch of new voters to be added to the rolls.

        What is amazing is a corrupt politician issues a edict without discussion with the public nor allowing the legislature to vote on the matter.    This is what is killing the country.  Officials abusing their authority be trampling the laws and Cnstitution of Virginia in the name of “social justice.”  The values  and traditions established by generations of Americans should not be shredded by such scum without retribution lest America wind up as snieveling chattel like the Europeans.

        Every single American is a felon, probably committing several felonies weekly. Some are real criminals who don’t get caught or don’t get prosecuted (Hi there Hillary, hi there vast horde of DAs to gutless or corrupt to indict her) but most are ordinary citizens afoul of one of eleventeen billion idiot laws.
So treating actually convicted felons differently after punishment than the uncaught average Joe felon makes little sense to me.

        Think what you could do with 20,000 extra free ballots if you are the strap-on psychopath in a pantsuit. Can’t think of a more cultural marxist method of vote rigging than the free use of 20,000 guys who reside in a crowbar hotel with no address or drivers licenses. The possibilities are limitless. It is gerrymandering on crack.

        Today’s voter rolls are well populated with dead people, illegal aliens, clones, and, yes, people who have served time for felonies, so one need not attach over much significance to this latest cynical spasm of the idiot McAuliffe.

        The whole point of serving a sentence for a crime is that once the sentence is served the offender is no longer an offender. The debt is paid and all normal rights are returned. Sure, I get that handing guns to former criminals who used guns before is a crazy idea — and for that matter allowing insane muslim terrorists to remain in the society they tried so hard to destroy is equally insane — but generally a person once out of clink has a chance to get on with life.However, our caring society still judges people after the jail rem is over. In the UK we had a footballer who was accused of rape, found guilty and went to jail. He had talent, and was young enough on release to resume his career in the sport. However he couldn’t find employment as angry supporters of any club showing an interest (and heaven knows some of those clubs needed all the help they could get) were threatened with boycotts by their own supporters, so this man was far from reckoned to have paid his debt.As justice would have it his case is being reopened with the original verdict quashed so he can face retrial which may prove his innocence. We shall see. I expect if he gets absolved of the crime he will be inundated with offers of employment, even though he has lost far more years from his career than his original sentence intended. I also expect all those nasty ‘supporters’ who screamed at their club for trying to sign the player will be feeling a little bit stupid if he turns out to be wholly innocent.

            UKer-I’d like you to say that to the widow who has seen her life savings stolen by a conman or to the woman who has been raped.   I’m sure they have been restored.   Now explain to me why allowing someone who has paid “their debt to society” should be prohibited from owning a gun, according to the little sermon you preached.   Little wonder that London now has far more crime than New York ever had and why the law abidding citizen in the UK lives like a frightened rabbit while hodlums run riot through the Uk.

        Actually, you need to purge the sex offenders rolls of those that don’t reoffend.We know a guy that was busted for a sex offense when he was 18. We’ve seen the info from the trial and talked to the prosecutor. He and a friend were at the park, drinking and smoking pot. Some young girls, aged 15 and 16, came up to hang out with them. He touched one one the breast while they were both fully clothed. He was arrested and convicted. He is in his late 40s, has never had any other sex offenses, yet still has to register as a sex offender. Because he routinely forgets this, he keeps getting thrown in jail. The prosecuter told us that she had no idea at the time that he would have to deal with this his whole life. He if had the money, she could get it expunged from his record. He will be dealing with this the rest of his life.

        A quick Google search –  “According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2,220,300 adults were incarcerated in US federal and state prisons, and county jails in 2013 – about 0.91% of adults (1 in 110) in the U.S. resident population”.
I don’t see how that few numbers could have any significant impact on the outcome of a US election. Do you have any voter statistics for prison participation in past elections? Are there different rules for state vs. federal prisoners with regards to being able to vote? Can an American citizen actually be denied the right to vote?

            In America, no states allow prisoners to vote. At least as far as I know. The issue here are ex-convicts who have served their time. Most states block ex-cons from voting. In a few states they can get their voting rights back after a period of time, assuming no additional trouble.

                While I can understand how someone would not be allowed to own a firearm after being convicted of a crime that involved the use of a firearm, being denied the right to vote doesn’t make any sense at all, regardless of the crime. Prisoners and ex-convicts are still citizens and protected under your Constitution and therefore should not be denied equal protection given to other citizens.

                        The mentally ill are the ones running for office – so what’s the difference! 😉 But seriously, all citizens should be allowed to vote regardless of their mental or criminal state. I don’t like the idea of anyone having the power to determine who can or can not vote – it is the most basic right of a democratic society. The very nature of citizenship grants all rights and protection to all citizens of that nation. Defining who is or is not entitled to specific rights is a very slippery slope.

                            Clearly Germany allows the mentally challenged to vote.   Must be nice to live in a society where there are no requirements to be able to vote.   In Democratic Germany do you allow aliens who reside in Germany to vote?   Do you allow felons who have committed murder to vote?  How about members of the Bader Menhoff gang?   Shouldn’t they be permitted to vote?   How about those who have never worked and rely on the handouts of the State.   Shouldn’t they be allowed to vote just like the working man who pays taxes?

                    So you would allow someone who committed treason, murder, arson, etc. the right to vote Karl?  On the contrary prisoners and convicts are not considered citizens if they are felons and the Constitution neither extends its priviledges and protections to those who would destroy it nor to those who seek to destroy civilized society.   Thats why the Constitution established courts and set up punishments.   But then again as an American I would not seek to pretend mastery of German law and society while so many Europeans lecture Americans on the US Constitution.

                Know what you call 20,000 felons voting for the psychopath in a pantsuit?Professional courtesy.
Besides, McAullife has a pen and a phone too. I guess they couldn’t ship in enough illegal immigrants on those empty FedEx and UPS cargo return flights in time for the primaries.

            In any national election int he US, the black vote has become the margin of victory for the Left.  In 2000, the candidates basically split evenly, statistically it was 50/50.   However, absent the black vote, it would have been Bush 55%, Gore 45%.   The calculation behind the current move is that bolstering that margin, even by a small bit, gives the Left a better chance of winning on a national level.  This, in turn, is based on the assumption that (1) most felons are black, and (2) blacks will vote D 90+% of the time.  Given that chance, the Left would violate any law, tradition, or constitutional provision.
