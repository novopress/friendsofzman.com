        The funniest part is that Team Brown put the whitest white guy on their team on TV to respond to Trump last night.  Even Team Brown knows who butters their bread.
That they put a Kennedy in front of an image of a broken down car (hood up), just adds to the crazy.

            That’s the issue with calling them team brown. While the base is brown, and like in most brown counties south of the US border, the leadership is not.

            This was obviously a leftie boomer idea.  No one my age or younger gives the tiniest rat’s behind about the Kennedy legacy.  And I’m middle aged.  Definitely no one aged 35 or younger even has a clear idea of who the Kennedys are or what their legacy might be.

        The key is ending chain migration. Last year I was invited to a birthday party in Canada. There were so many people it was held in a hotel ballroom. They were all from the same Asian family and had started with one immigrant about 15 years ago. These are all nice, productive people with a western mindset, but I can just about guarantee you that the ones with citizen status voted for Trudeau’s party because of their cosmopolitan prejudices.Just because I like these people is no reason to agree with the fact that this form of immigration is a good thing. Many of them have government jobs. Some told us that the government preferred them over native Canadians because of their superior work ethic, lack of absenteeism, and unquestioningly doing their jobs, which they love having. They are there to displace native Canadians. The problem for the Canadian government is that the kids all go to Canadian schools and learn the mores of native Canadians as taught by socialist unionized teachers. The benefit to Canada of these imports is only 1-1.5 generations. Then what are they going to do? Import more to take their place?This is insanity.

            First become aware of the chain issue several years ago when invited to a dinner where Kevin Hassett and Andrew Biggs were speaking and happened to get seated with Biggs for the meal.  The table topic was how to keep Social Security solvent.  Biggs brought up several issues, but one was chain migration–and bringing elderly parents over that would immediately file for SSI, Medicare, or the SS program that allows work credits from the home country system to be applied to SS eligibility here.  While no one was drawing a full benefit, cumulatively, it was bleeding out the system.  Had never heard of it before.  Then saw what I assume was this “in action” a couple months ago at an opthamalic surgery center in NY where the waiting room was literally nothing but elderly, completely non English speaking Chinese, all getting cataract surgeries on Medicare/Medicaid.  I have nothing against people getting needed medical care, but it seemed to be the fulfillment of what Biggs was talking about back in 2012.

        Team Brown has managed to permanently alter the composition of the country in any case. Stanching the flow is a good first step, but stanching the flow will be a permanent chore going forward. I like to say we’ve been importing Yugoslavia for the past half-century, by which I mean the conditions for tribal warfare are being brought here deliberately, but perhaps I’m just getting a little excited. I don’t see the way to restoring the country without terrifying bloodshed.

            We can only escape this multicultural cul-de-sac by the same route we entered: war. One can observe the acceleration of liberalism after each war beginning in 1865. We keep upping the ante with every conflict and with every wave of immigration. When it comes apart, it will do so in a horrifying conflagration. It seems to be the lot of every civilization to either go down in a smoking heap of ruins, or to crawl out of said ruins and rebuild a new civilization. There is no “reforming” the kind of society we have become. Progressivism either prevails, or we destroy it completely and start over.

                I don’t think this is necessary and I don’t want a large civil war. The only way to make this work is to get rid of the Jews and their 24 hour none stop appeal to hate against Whites. We can work out something amicable with all the new immigrants if we don’t have the Jews pushing for genocide constantly.

                    But you corroborate my thesis. Getting rid of those parasites will inevitably do grave harm to the host. Think of your otherwise reasonable gentile neighbors who will oppose ANY action against The Tribe. That gives you an idea of how nasty this will get. And the The Tribe knows it.

        One lingering issue in a localist future: Immigration and naturalization must remain federally enforced and restrictive. Otherwise you would have a situation where California (of course) would be super liberal (granting citizenship even) then turning the “new Americans” loose on the rest of the country much the way the EU works.

            My hope, and it is hope at this point, is that we are seeing the Overton Window swing quickly. We now see Republicans (up for election) getting to the right of Trump on immigration. The midterms will be a referendum on immigration. If it goes well, I suspect we see the GOP push forward with restrictionist polices. This combined with the decline of the national Democrat party would accelerate the localist impulse of the Left.
This probably would have happened much sooner if not for the Cold War.

                Years ago I would have thought  the left would never agree to local control because they would be afraid of Red states instituting bigotry (as they see it). But now the lefties are indeed talking separation themselves, so I do think this might happen. If they could grudgingly admit that conservative states have a right to be conservative, I could actually see the necessary Constitutional Amendments passing.When you see that no president  from this point forward is going to get out of the 40s or low 50s in approval ratings you realize we are turning into two countries, but not (yet) geographically

                    Lefties will do anything to attain and retain power. Anything at all including mass murder, gulags, etc.Just scratch their surface and they are all Joe Stalin clones. As someone else said, “inside every liberal progressive is a totalitarian screaming to get out.”
For lefties, the ends justifies the means; it always has and always will.
Nothing they do, absolutely nothing, surprises me. And it should not surprise any carbon based life form either.

                Republicans up for re-election only think they are to Trump’s right on immigration. Trump is running game on Democrats and Republocrats because he can and because he has to. One dog is herding sheep and ducks together, and he knows where the gate is.

                I think you are overly optimistic, yet I also hope you are right. Locally, the two Republican contenders for the state legislature seat both mention immigration, but the female (endorsed, of course, by our senile outgoing House Rep) lists her first qualification in her mailings as being an “educator” and pro-life.  Yes, she also claims to be pro 2nd amendment and against sanctuary cities, but she’s still the boilerplate churchian conservatard GOPe.  The businessman running against her, in contrast, lists numerous different anti-immigration and pro-border policies in his much more aggressively-worded campaign mailings.  It will be interesting to see who the locals choose.  If the past is anything to go by, it will be the “nice lady.”

        When it comes to the sanctuary state of california, why doesn’t the President just announce that no immigration laws will be enforced in California but will be throughout the rest of the country, thereby allowing California to be a magnet for all illegal immigrants. At that point the rest of us can demand that California secede.

            Bad idea.Once the illegals enter Ca., they then will find it very easy to migrate into the rest of the USA. So instead of patrolling and shuttering the USA/Mexico border, which is tough enough, the entire eastern border of Ca. would also need to be controlled.And that would be impossible.

                John;I agree completely that allowing a ‘Free Cali’ is a very bad idea, just not mainly for the reason you cite.  It’s true enough that the ‘Free Cali’ border would be long, hence difficult to patrol.  OTOH, most of it is difficult mobility terrain, mostly desert, hostile to casual crossers even where it’s not desert (e.g. the Donner Party).Now, one can argue that the *existing* Mexican border is mostly desert and yet leaks like a sieve.  The counter-arguments would be that up until now we had only pretended to enforce it (border security theater).  The Israelis have recently demonstrated how to effectively seal a desert border against casual crossers using not much manpower.  It would be easy enough to follow their example.  All we lack is the will to break the backs of our current elites, politically if possible.But the real geo-strategic danger to allowing a ‘Free Cali’ is that, because their elite are stupid and weak-minded, they would early on be looking for an outside major power protector* so that their lotus-eating could continue unabated.  And it’s pretty clear that they’d do it because living at the sufferance of the rest of us would be insufferable to their SJW Feminist natures: They have gotten used to demanding that others do things for them, after all.Mexico, had they any brains, would reject that role for the simple reason that they would be at least doubling the border that *they* would then have to defend against a now-hostile ‘Remaining 49’ with not much addition to their already very limited military strength.**That would leave only China or Russia since they have some of the sea power needed to send and maintain forces across the Pacific.***  And they would certainly welcome the chance to become the super-power in our place.  And hubris might well get in the way of prudence for them.If they did try it, one could foresee a rerun of the Cuban Missile Crisis in some form or other.  Then as now, a powerful foreign nuclear-armed power intervening on or near CONUS creates an existential threat to the ‘Remaining 49’.  It’s hard to imagine even our feckless Cloud Folk permitting this.^ That the likely result of ‘Free Cali’ could be coastal Cali glowing in the dark following a nuclear exchange would be small consolation.The other likely scenario is that we would find out about it first and crush Free Cali with conventional forces.  That long border would be much harder for them to control than it would be for us.  And why should we have to control it_?  The question answers itself.__________________________* Every global empire has grown largely by being invited to intervene in favor of one side or another in a neighbor’s factional dispute.  They simply never leave after that, and the inviting faction is lucky if they live to rue their folly.** This logic applies double to Canada which has a *very* long  US border and almost no strategic depth behind any of it.  It would take *marching* (much less road mobile) troops less than a week to cut their lateral communications at almost any point.  Earlier, smarter US leaders allowed Canada to exist because it had little potential to turn into a major threat and it was a useful hostage against the then-dangerous British Empire’s good conduct after 1814.***With great logistical difficulty, I might add, even without hostilities from the ‘Remaining 49’: Hence my mentioning ‘prudence’.^Allowing a foreign power onto the US mainland is practically guaranteed to result in their overthrow ‘with extreme prejudice’.

        The decentralization arguments will dry up the moment they return to power, which while unlikely in 2020, isn’t so far fetched in 2024. Progressive power has puritan and hacid themes, but it is machivellian in nature.

        Did you see David Brook’s hate piece on rural and working white American on Sailer’s Blog today? Total honesty is the new norm for these traitors, they don’t even disguise their plans or hatred.The East Germans of the 21st CenturyDavid Brooks JAN. 29, 2018Every few years I try to write a column staking out a reasonable middle ground on immigration. ….The case for restricting immigration seems superficially plausible. …Every few years I try to write this moderate column. And every few years I fail. That’s because when you wade into the evidence you find that the case for restricting immigration is pathetically weak.… Get in your car. If you start in rural New England and drive down into Appalachia or across into the Upper Midwest you will be driving through county after county with few immigrants. These rural places are often 95 percent white. These places lack the diversity restrictionists say is straining the social fabric.Are these counties marked by high social cohesion, economic dynamism, surging wages and healthy family values? No. Quite the opposite. They are often marked by economic stagnation, social isolation, family breakdown and high opioid addiction. Charles Murray wrote a whole book, “Coming Apart,” on the social breakdown among working-class whites, many of whom live in these low immigrant areas.… Of course they react with defensive animosity to the immigrants who out-hustle and out-build them. You’d react negatively, too, if confronted with people who are better versions of what you wish you were yourself.

            Whew! Purely anecdotal, but as one who was brought up in those rural areas, spent much of my adult life in diversified, urban areas, and now have come back to the heartland, I’d say that the opiods, the stagnation. the same ennui is found in the cities, unless you’re in the gated communities — there, the economics are better and the opiods come from friendly doctors instead of the street.Only as a female, I can walk down the road or Main St. without fear, while in the cities, I was fair game for all kinds of “Hey, how are ya, what’s the matter don’t you like black/Hispanic/Egyptian/whatever guys?” So I’ll take the nationalist, rural working classes over the globalist, urban working classes anytime.

        Z Man;Re white Prog. ethnic cleansing of the urban centers:  It will be interesting to see who wins the ‘Battle of Chicago’.  On one side you have the ‘gentrifying’ SWPL faction led by Rahm Emmanuel and on the other you have the ‘Drugs &amp; Thugs’ faction, right now seemingly disorganized, voiceless but violent.One might suppose that the millennial yuppie SWPL’s, being stupid, rich, lazy and crazy, would be easy prey for the D&amp;T-er’s.  But so far almost all the shooting and looting has been confined to the brown zone.  I’m not sure how that’s being done now but sooner or later this uneasy equilibrium is going to break down.  Maybe the much maligned ‘blue wall’ will break (or give up and move out).The sad-a**ed remnant of the Chicago Machine had been kicking the can down the road by Obama and his minion’s exporting the D&amp;T overflow that somehow escaped Planned Parenthood via Section 8 housing vouchers into the exurbs.  This is very likely coming to an end if it has not already.  Moreover, the ability to buy out potential D&amp;T agitators is near its end because IL is running out of money.  Obama &amp; Co may well have  been among the last to ride that money train.

            Funny you should mention this. Someone just told me yesterday about her daughter telling her about a murder that took place right in front of her gentrified townhouse a couple of blocks from the worst part of her city. And the kid was surprised.
The mom told me that the cops usually keep things pretty well cordoned off.
Seems to be breaking down already.

            I was thinking this thought riding to work on the EL this morning but along different lines. This city is as blue as it gets but there are many red-pilled guys here and country conservatives. Not to mention the red suburbs who are mostly armed. You saw it when Trump tried to speak at UIC.
If some sort of civil strife occurs, I believe Chicago will be a flash point. Perhaps the Trump riot will be considered the first signs of struggle.

                Agree.  Chicago still has a big population of the Red-diaper types that thirst for this kind of conflict.  Funny, but happen to be writing this from the Palmer House this morning. Noticed last when I got here and went wandering out for a quick dinner that the bum population seems up from last year and more aggressive.

        A lot of this immigration BS is driven by women. They vote and legislate according to their emotions rather than common sense. Sure, the coloured minorities are driving this – but they wouldn’t have been able to succeed without the Liberal American Shrew supporting them all the way. I’ve tried to debate with women; anyone else who has knows how they roll too – appeals to common sense and logic just don’t fly for a healthy majority of women. Women are fascists and socialists by nature as well – and although a minority of them can rise above that – most can’t.The problem now is that they are meeting the consequences of their actions and they’re getting what they voted for, good and hard: their husbands, fathers, and brothers are getting screwed in the ear with political correctness, social justice, and affirmative action. All of a sudden, diversity and inclusion is biting THEM on the arse. Reality is facing quite a few American women in the face, and they don’t like the colour of it – and who can blame them? I know you find the term ‘red pill’ amusing, Z – but this is what it is. Women have overwhelmingly chosen to take that pill as a suppository and they don’t like it any more than their men do. Trump’s election and his success since is testament to it.Trump has effectively divided the Donks against each other: there is no room over there for sane white men, and only the battiest of the femcnuts, race whores, and SJW’s can thrive there. The Democrats have a choice now: social justice and obscurity – or burn down their own party and rebuild it in a way that aligns with working Americans.

            Glen, you are correct.  Women act from emotion.  But when the real world slaps them (or their men) across the face, they double down.  If only the world would listen to them and do things their way, unicorns and sparkles would ensue.  If a dark-complected person attacks someone, it is because the dark one was discriminated against.

                They will double down if they can, Dutch. Notice the vagina hat crowd that still protests for rights and freedoms they already have.  But – what happens if doubling down only results in more bitch slapping? Once women understand that, they become more compliant with reality – or at least, most will. And – if their matriarchal instincts still work they will act to defend their families too. I’ve always held that women will do the right thing once all the alternatives are exhausted. They are seriously running out of alternatives fast.Of course, I could be full of beans and you may be correct. Lord knows you have more than enough ammo for your argument.

                    Such a generalization, guys. Don’t be so taken in by the media’s idea/picture of what women think (and yes, we think, not just feel). By a good margin, married women are conservative. You are seeing on your tv screens (having one of those in your house greatly distorts reality), what the media WANTS men to think women are like. It’s as if you believed all blacks ae scientists and doctors because that’s what you see on TV.If you are married, think of your own wife. Would she be caught dead marching for abortions in a pussy hat?  If you’re not married yet, wait until you are to decide what women are really like. Put in “Deplorable” on Twitter, and you’ll see that a good half of those happily supporting the prez are female…and they have nothing in common with the stereotype shown on cable TV.From a Christian, conservative, dissident-right, nationalist, Midlandia female who — yes, as a kid — was a leftist feminist….but who grew up.P.S. If I can add one more thing — it hurts the “movement,” “cause,” or whatever you want to call it when you write off half the population as mindless men-haters when we are just as distressed about places like CA and just as determined as you are to create a traditional living space where Western civilization is protected and treasured.

        About a dozen years ago, a headhunter told me he had to drop me.  Reason?  I lived in the mid-west, his clients were all on the coasts, and they’d have to pay me 50% more than a local just so I could afford the housing.  That was an alarm bell ringing in my head that the low-interest rates coupled with gov’t guarantees of loans via Fannie/Freddy/etc… was helping drive the “ghettoization”.  The question I have is whether the gov’t is creating housing bubbles, at least partially, because it helps keep the bad thinkers out of the coastal trendy areas.

            PartiallyAlso the economy in a global sense is really whack.There is suppression of wages by automation, population aging in areas with functional economies  and globalism lowering demand but increasing profitsA lack of innovative products anyone wants or can afford (c.f the poor sales on the new I-Phone) and vast levels of government debtThe debt forces lower interest rates as wellSo you have tons of money out there with nowhere to go but housing and not even enough demand for solid inflationThus much higher housing prices which of course reduces non housing income (i.e discretionary spending )and longer term  family formation in high cost areas and you get a vicious spiralThey way you fix it is to reverse migration and force banks, foreigners and the like to divest but this would have other effects in terms of wiping out bank profits and creating a housing crisisIt won’t happen and the government will keep kicking the can until it collapsesHow long that will take, no one knows, As the old saw goes markets can stay irrational longer than you and I can stay solvent.

        “Peaceful separation, so to speak.”
That’s just as feasible as the unicorn riding leprechaun.   Progs are incapable of supporting themselves, they need a host to leech off of.  Every government jurisdiction they control is broke or about to be, and desperate for infusions of cash from somewhere.

        The really sad part of this whole “Browning of America” issue is that most White people have been so totally brainwashed and over/under educated by both our liberal media and our socially progressive Universities that they either refuse to see a problem or simply can’t see a problem with unbridled immigration.

            The latest polls show 75% of people want a reduction in immigration and nearly half want repatriationOur rulers however want reliable votes and cheap labor and don’t want us.Right now we are still trying to make the political  process work instead of forcing our leaders to comply. Understandable, when the US goes down, it likely won’t get up and the level of suffering caused by such a war would be immenseThere is still some hope so people are clinging to itThe hell of it is , the  divisions are so great that if a magic comet seeded the US spores   that only White people were immune to , ending race matters  forever odds are good  the nation would still have no reason to existThe cultural divide is vast and truth be known, people as close as upstate New York shouldn’t be ruled by people from the City much less say people from New York City having any say to someone in WyomingWe don’t have an easy way to end the empire and rightsize the US in I don’t know 11 or more nationsIt what we need to d though and long long term it will happen. Few nations these days are within natural boundaries and these things have a way or self correcting

                Surely it’s an acceptable outcome if the progs all essentially relocate to their own “country” (or indeed actual country)?
Plausible outcome?  No.  Excellent outcome?  Self evidently yes by my reckoning.

        There’s other choices than the ones you gave us. It’s very likely, almost a given that Whites will become a minority. It’s held that they will gang on Whites with Jew media, power and money. I suggest that none of these immigrants have any love for Jews at all. Maybe we will not see eye to eye on everything but I bet that it would not throw the immigrants into a tizzy if we got rid of the Jews. Let them all move to Israel. Get them away from us.There’s no doubt at all that the biggest reason by far that we have all these immigrants is the Jews. There’s also no doubt that the reason that we have all these wars are the Jews. There’s also no doubt that the immense Federal Debt is because of the Jews. (All money is debt doesn’t have to be this way).I say this is a golden opportunity to get rid of them. I want this to happen peacefully but we need to get rid them no matter what.We should all band together, Right, Left, immigrants, heritage and whoever to get rid of the Jews.If we do this the children will be happier. The Sun will shine more and life will better and full of Love!If we don’t do this the big blaring constant hate Whitey megaphone of the Jews will put us in constant peril of being murdered. It’s a matter of survival.

                True this. if there was a Wakanda every .Alt Right person would have many positive things to say about them especially as its an ethnic state, advanced nation with smart people and a monarchyThey drool over authoritarian Singapore after allRace wouldn’t really matterAlas its pure fictionAnd while there are some very smart Igbo an others  out there, there are not enough for a nation and those people and the  other African folk with good brains are swamped by their much lower IQ/High time preference cousinsBrains matter but a society is driven by its averages and on average Africa just isn’t smart.Also re Black Panther early sales pumped by hype, Leftist hive mind or Soros Bucks for all I know doesn’t indicate long term successI head similar claptrap about the Last Jedi and it did poorly and as kicked out of ChinaB.P could fail in a week or prove to be amazing.Somehow though I I don’t think the Right White or Hispanics or Asians will be lining up to see this any more than the next Medea movie . There might be enough superhero junkies, Leftists and others to buoy it to success though . If so good on themAs Mama Prosper always told me  “Consider the source.” and the hype is taintedAll that aside  some sense Tiny Duck in his current incarnation is correct. The future will be diverse but it will probably be real diversity with a myriad of nations with separate ethnic and cultural boundaries and identitiesThis is better for everyone because what the Left calls diversity is poison .It creates a gulag shopping mall culture with the outside trappings of diversity and while its there obliterates indigenous peoples and real diversityGood for profits for a while, bad for humanity  and if you love diversity, you support boundaries
