        I always thought I was maybe a little too cynical, but this USAID business shows me that I’m not cynical enough. time to redouble my efforts

            The idea that the entire shitlib/leftist/our democracy/etc. project of the past 70 years was created and is sustained by the US government entirely is the biggest redpill I’ve had in a while. It reminds me of the astronaut meme, “so the federal government was the primary villain all along?” “Always has been”
It also makes you think what our society would be like without it, and how was the US government so successful at creating an alternative reality and propagating it and forcing us to live under it for so long.

                I find myself thinking about all the things USAID and others like it orchestrated over the past decades, for which evidence is no longer available for DOGE to uncover (not to mention what DOGE is holding back). However, it probably wasn’t until after The Precious came to power that USAID was completely taken over by the woke baizuo left and became Clown World Inc. I expect that the farther back in time you go the closer it adhered to its original mission.

                    You’d hope so. But probably not. They were probably laughing at us since the day we were born for being so gullible. It’s a shame. But, now it’s time for that to end and we are still alive. It’s a good day.

                    There is an adage in the law biz where destroying evidence is more often worse than just turning it over.
With the evidence destroyed, you have admitted two things:
And now, with it gone, it can be imagined to be as bad as your opponent wants it to be.

The Radical Industrial Complex is Skynet, and the only way forward is for it to be destroyed.I hate to be a cynic in such a momentous time as what we’re experiencing right now, but I strongly suspect that we won’t get “tanks in the streets”; that, instead, we will get Anduril rocket-drones receiving their targetting instructions from OpenAI.Anduril Rocket Droneshttps://youtu.be/al9ITeP4fUA===============“Defense manufacturer gets massive $452 million Ohio tax credit”“‘Hyperscale’ military drone facility to be built in Ohio Construction is about to begin on a 465,000 sq m military drone factory on a 200ha plot in Ohio for defence company Anduril…”“Anduril Hits $14B Valuation With Latest Funding”===============(((Larry Ellison))): “Citizens Will Be on Their ‘Best Behavior’ with AI Surveillance”President Trump at the White House… Stargate Partners… “((Larry Ellison))), (((Sam Altman))) and Masayoshi Son.”===============I sure as hell don’t wanna be on the losing end of Heritage American Patriots versus [Anduril + Stargate].We’re gonna be slaughtered.

            I first got hip to this about 15 years ago.  Some guy whose name I cannot remember was giving a talk at some Canadian university.  A bunch of leftists showed up and attacked police, attacked the audience and then pulled the fire alarm to shut it down.  It turned out, all of the protestors were from a government union and they were all paid to be there.

                    It’s been glaringly obvious for quite some time now which rioters are on the government payroll and which ones aren’t. Burn a city block, torch a cop car, and loot a store full of flatscreens in the name of St. George of Fentanyl, and if by chance you do get arrested the charges will be dropped and you’ll get paid for your “false arrest.”But if you so much as pass gas within a mile of an abortion clinic, all hell will break loose upon you. Criticize U.S. subservience to Israel,  protest COVID restrictions, or stand up for Confederate heritage and see how harshly you are dealt with.

                        Yes. And if you get bused into a riot area, provided the rest of the logistical support you need to riot for days, weeks or months, (food, water, shelter), and then get bused into a new area after that, then you see the extent of the gulf between who the system privileges and who it doesn’t.

                                I want to see 90% black female unemployment, as all the chair warmers and DIE hires get exposed and fired by DOGE.  Decimate the fictional ‘black middle class’ which is entirely funded by pseudo-gov grift.  Then let DCriot like it did in ’68, call in the mestizo army and have them shoot therioters.  Let all the AWFLs and their families in MD/VA/DC wet their pants.

                        Hell, take it on back to the so-called “civil rights movement.” Look at all those marches and protests so adored by academia and Hollywood, and how they were protected and probably promoted by FedGov. Now imagine similar events organized by white nationalists and what FedGov’s response would be. You don’t really have to stretch your muscles of hypothesis very much. Just look at Charlottesville, for criminy sakes.

                            Correct. The “civil rights movement” of the Sixties was conducted with the knowledge that it had the backing of the Federal government.
Once the government sent active-duty troops into Little Rock High with bayonets fixed against white people, Kang knew he had a green light to perform his street theater with impunity.

                            I’ve always said that protesting only works when you are protesting for or against what the elite already want.  There is no doubt that many of the protests were paid for by the government.
Plus, a lot of the stories are complete bullshit and about as accurate as the Charlottesville stories.  “Peaceful protestors” who simply sat down at a lunch counter, literally dindu nuffin, and a bunch of mean white racists attacked them because of their black hearts.
The protestors the state backs are always violent. Left wing protests, period, are always violent.

                        Well, this is anarcho-tyranny and we’ve been living under it for a while. But it got even worse than that.Remember when the riot cities had random piles of brick show up one day? And the media claimed that this was totally normal from construction? Since when do construction crews leave random unprotected piles of bricks on the sidewalks? Of course those bricks were used that same night to break windows. If I recall correctly, they even had a good scam going to pay the Antifa rioters. They would get arrested and thrown in jail and a “NGO” would give them money for bail, a couple thousand bucks or a few hundred or whatever. Then the rioter would get released from jail without bail, and they could keep the money. This is without even getting into the camps that were set up to feed and house these degenerates.Then you had Christopher Wray lie to Congress about how Antifa was just “an idea”, even though these money tracks were all over the place. The media even ran articles about these camps and who was paying for them, and explicitly mentioned that they were being run to help Antifa. The RICO cases were literally outlined in the media and Wray goes out there and says Antifa is an idea. He’s the enemy.

            As cathartic as that would be, I don’t think that ever going to happen. One, there are a lot of people that believe in the h’caust, and two, a lot more people don’t care about it enough to challenge the narrative. There are still third rails in politics. Most people respond to “government waste” and “fiscal responsibility” that’s probably enough to get people on Trump’s side.

                Based on the polls, it’s not just going to happen but it is inevitable. Nobody cares about it outside of boomers and gen X. There is leaked audio of Greenblatt saying that they have a huge generational problem. That is why they are trying to clamp down harder, it’s why they are trying to force the TikTok sale, it’s why museums are going up faster than you can blink, it’s why they are trying to throw 100 year old grandpas in jail because they worked as a security guard for 6 months in 1944. THEY understand that there is a shelf life on the utility of this narrative, so I think it is more productive if WE understand that too as opposed to just claiming it’s never going to change. Younger historians will be re-examining this event, it is inevitable, heck they already are.

                    This. It explains the mad scramble to ethnically cleanse Gaza while a philo-Semitic president is in office, for example. The United States is rapidly becoming like much of Western Europe in its attitude toward Israel. Mass migration, which most Jews supported, along with disenchanted native populations, means a decade at best of what we always assumed would be the norm. There may be a tiny bit of more struggle to keep the USAID grift going than otherwise since the AIPAC graft has a limited shelf life.

                        Indeed. The Israelis are keenly aware of the major demographic issues which I think is causing them to ramp up the Greater Israel project with a ‘now or never’ attitude. They must secure their expansion before the dutiful boomer/X slaves pass on. If not, they will never become the unquestioned lord and master of the Middle East. The GAE is also receding, so they won’t have the global hegemon acting as their hatchet man like they’ve been accustomed to for the last 6 decades.I just hope Bibi lives long enough to see his entire life’s mission end in a humiliating defeat.

                        They probably got the message through to Trump that they will Ivana Ivanka if he doesn’t at least play along somewhat. I remember Ivanka speaking about one of her new Judaism convert practices was that when she wakes up every morning she gives thanks that her body works. While that sounds enlightened and soft, maybe the message was different to DJT.

                    Ludicrous amounts of detailed information now on numerous platforms; these are treasure chests waiting for our heirs if we can secure their future.
That singular great blood libel is not only the root mythos of the 3rd Founding, but the basis of all today’s twisted, perverted moral reasoning.
A whitepill, perhaps, is that this was done before in the ancient times, yet we took it back with the New Testament and refashioned a great good from it.
The Hologram replaced not the Biblical mythic history, but our Greco-Roman mythic history studied by classical Europeans.

                        The Roman empire was not a myth. It shaped Europe as did Christianity. I can find Rome still alive even in the languages of Europe. There is every reason to believe the Bible as historical text, even though it’s fallen out of fashion, with academics “too hip” to believe it.The Hologram in contrast is 100% mythos, meant to line the pockets of the Jews during the Jewish century. Completely different thing.

Depends on the Gen X (ahem).  A not insignificant number of Gen X care about it in the sense that you care about a thing about which you have been fed lies.

                        That’s it, c matt, that’s exactly it.Worse, they then justify their continuing stance based on the something they made up.
The story of the camps was propaganda by Big J to scare Little J into colonizing Palestine…Little J didn’t want to go live in a tent surrounded by hostile locals.
A corollary was the French Terror used to frighten French elites out of their estates, so those estates could be confiscated with fake assignats and re-sold for real gold.
If Uncle A wanted to genocide them, he would’ve simply bombed the camps.

                        They aren’t going away, so we and Trump will just have to deal with it. There are other problem populations – including our spiteful mutants and seduced women – and we’re trying to deal with them, that’s the conditions on the ground.
Scoff you may, but Gazaland is a deft bit of judo- he’s trying to buy them off with their own greed, while reassuring their elites of their continued existence (and our invested protection.)
As to the Pali’s, the UN’s big business is ‘refugee’ resettlement, why can’t they do Pali’s? (Millions of Germans were forced out of Sudentenland…)

It will happen someday. The cracks are already forming. Even being forgotten is a win for the truth. We may not live to see it, but every historical event does truly become old news after a while.

                Holocaust$, inc is not the Holocaust as such.  It’s the giant grift around it.   Check out Norman Finkelstein’s book on the subject, The Holocaust Industry.Frankly, I could not care less about the Holocaust whether or not in happened in the full scope (which I doubt) that is always reported.  It was done neither by or to my people.  WTF does America have to do with it?  We were the ones fighting it.  Yet we are somehow always told “never again” Holocaust museums all over the US!!!  Outside of Israel, there has never been a country more open to Jews. No pogroms. No laws discriminating against them.  Friggin ingrates.  Anyone who even brings up the subject should be deported immediately.

McHolocaust museums are all over the world. There’s a list on Wikipedia. I think of them as shrines to modern Jews, a secular religious building.

                I heard that holocaust remembrance is all about remembering how normal-seeming, civilized people can commit atrocities, according to Jewish groups recently. A lecture. A thesis even.
They say that with a straight face after what we have seen Israel do on and since Oct 7th. It’s the most blinkered thing I have ever seen any person or group say. Ever. We have to assert our independence from that madness. Especially when Israel thinks they can call on our military whenever they so choose to. That was how we got “anal-feeding” in gitmo. No more desert wars!

                        I’d say that until I started reading DR blogs, manosphere stuff, etc… about 10 years ago, I never questioned things like, for instance, the moon landing. Now I don’t actually believe they filmed the whole thing in Hollywood either. Most of the attacks on the moon landings thatI’ve readwill assert that it couldn’t have been possible for various technical reasons. Most of these are answerable by just pointing out that the government back then didn’t much care if they lost a few guys. Upstaging the Soviets was worth a few dead astronauts. The most obvious problem is that the thin metal of the moon ships wouldn’t protect anyone from getting a lethal dose of radiation if the sun had decided to act up during the trip.Today, I’m willing to listen to people challenge this stuff if they have good arguments. Basically, I’ve just realized that there’s almost no topic the government and mainstream opinion makerswon’tlie about if it suits them. The result is that my mind is now perhapstooopen about many historical “facts”.The systematic lying and creation of “narratives” about everything probably began with WWII. There was this feeling that we were in an existential fight and to that end no lie was too big. The problem is that the war ended and the war mentality just carried on. Many wartime institutions like the CIA (formerly the OSS) also kept going and helped nurture and spread the culture of lies. Today, almost everything is propaganda.

                                I’m afraid this isn’t one of those good arguments. Lots of nations have sent men into low earth orbit in spacesuits or pressurized space stations and spacecraft. The space near the Moon isn’t that much emptier. Once you get down to a few millibars of pressure you’re effectively in vacuum. Physiologically, there’s no real difference and it’s no harder to make a spacesuit or capsule that can protect people on or near the Moon than it is to make one that can work while orbiting the Earth.

                                The vacuum is trivial. Hard vacuum, by definition, is only 15 psi. An aluminum can holds well over 50 psi. Yah, yah hoop stress, I know, but that’s part of the reason the capsule was kept small.
Radiation is another matter, but, as @Pozy pointed out, even if it killed the astronauts in 6 months, TPTB figured it would be worth it.

            First the narrative and moral order of WW2 needs to be reexamined by normie. As the boomers die off, we’ll see this become more common, as there’s a lot of meat on that bone that historians haven’t been allowed to tug at. We see it starting to happen with people like Darryl Cooper and Zoomer Historian. David Irving tried this decades ago and literally had his life ruined over it, you can see there’s less resistance now.

                It’s the Boomers that uniformly safe guarded the narrative, with their love of WWII mythos. Boomers in particular as a generation value unity, to the point where they are willing to ruin almost anyone to have it. They are the epitome of the “the nail that sticks up gets hammered down”.Gen X will be complicit in trying to keep the old order, but it won’t be from a want of unity. It will be lack of alternatives to the Boomer POV.

                        What Gen X is not is unified on subjects, the way that Boomers are. Older Gen X will sound very much like Boomers. However, most of the dissents I know online are clearly of Gen X (or Y) age.

        That last paragraph sums it all up. The 2020 Revolution was The Regime grabbing America by the throat with two hands. For four years they squeezed as hard as they could.
If they are not destroyed and permanently disabled with no chance of being reconstituted, they will put both hands back on and squeeze even harder. This is for real and it is for all the marbles.

                Yeah, if they just let him win in 2020, none of this stuff happens, twitter is still under enemy control, who knows who they run in 2024 (Pence?), and we are probably under the control of Newsome or Whitmer right now.As for covid, under Trump, they could’ve extended the lockdowns in blue-run states through the 2024 election to punish the people as much as possible.  On the flip side, who knows how they would’ve played the vaxx–none of them seemed to want to take “Trump’s death juice” until it became “Biden’s miracle cure”, but there was obviously a lot of money producing the mrna therapies.

                    It’s their demand for total control that sows the seeds of their own setbacks (I wish I could say destruction). For instance, it’s why the “left” has no bench of up and coming leaders. If you want anyone to follow you, you need people in charge (or at least figureheads) who people want to follow. But their handpicked “leaders” are selected for obeisance, rather than for those qualities. For the last decade or so anyway.

It’s on the spreadsheet.)AOC is a retarded titty girl, literally the product of a DSA casting call for someone to play the revolutionary conscience of America.

                Clearly, Trump didn’t waste that 4 years in the wilderness.  He (or people working for him) spent it analyzing what went wrong the first time, and figuring out a plan of attack for when he returned.

                    Seeing now what Project 2025 has been up to, I feel a little regretful for cutting off mom’s monthly donation to the Heritage Foundation after I took over her estate. Back then they seemed to me like a bunch of money grubbing rinos, and probably were. I’m not sure when the change happened. Good to see they managed without it. At least I got a HF coffee cup out of it.

                    They got caught so off-guard thinking that after Obama, and his vast spying apparatus that Maxine Waters let slip out of the bag on national TV lol, and after Joe Biden fortification, there was no way there was anyone who didn’t agree with them left in these Depts. and Orgs., but there were. And God bless them!(Those are probably the ones and only ones that are going to get the 8 months severance pay for a job well done.

                It is more than the steal. It is the culmination of a full blown revolution. BLM formation then St. Louis, Kavanaugh hearings, ’20 mass riots, defund the police, dissolve the borders, iconography, Kalergi cultural genocide mass acceleration … …
Two hands on the throat from ’20 on. The steal was one part of it. There will be no second chance. It is winner take all time now.

        So conspicuously absent from the DOGE disclosures are Republican and right leaning names (although Bill Kristol, Lindsey Graham, and Richard Hanania have all come up), that I’m inferring things from that absence. And I’m not inferring that it’s because Republicans are clean.Trump needs the “rinos” to confirm his more controversial nominees. And he can do it by holding what DOGE has unearthed over their heads. I’d been predicting rather emphatically that RFKJ would not be confirmed, but maybe I was wrong. Maybe this is how he gets Mitch and his pals to vote yes. (Recall that Mitch voted no on Hegseth, back before any of this DOGE stuff started coming out). You can be damn sure that bitch from Alaska was on the take. Just to name one. Probably all of them. It’s entertaining watching some of them pretend to be outraged by the disclosures, as if they hadn’t known all along, and participated.At least the “right” has the sense to be ashamed. The “left” doesn’t appear to feel any shame about it. My read is that not only are they not ashamed, they think there’s nothing wrong with what they did, they’re proud of it, and they’d do it again.It’s very sad that it’s considered controversial for a young man to say he’d never marry outside his race

            RFK and Tulsi are peanuts in comparison to eliminating the grift slush funds.  It’s not worth the trade.  If the Rinos cave, I would just nominate Ben Carson and Mike Flynn in their place, and like Billy Bean tells Art Howe in Moneyball, “Art, I can do this all day.”

That position was created after 9/11 along with Homeland Security to centralize all information feeds; Tulsi can reach into any stack jealously protecting its information and demand to extract the records.
…for OpenAI to parse, there’s the rub; Musk having full access to citizen, corporate, and financial info as well as government info means he intends to be the white Chamberlain under a Jewish throne. Better one of ours gets ahead of this thing, than a billionaire Soros.

            Because of my work I have to see and hear the real Democrat base, adult children of privilege, talking among themselves. Here’s what they’re saying:“Because normal Americans didn’t find out untiljust nowexactly to whom their stolen money was being given—whileweknew all along—they deserved to have it stolen, and we deserved to have it. And we’ll have it forever, because DOGE is a trick to get the MAGAts on side with their own impoverishment (taking away their Social Security, Medicaid, etc.)—and with ‘tech,’ which isus,as this DOGE chud’s firing proves. Now, we wait.”They do knowwho’s who(m). It’s their whole life.

            At least the “right” has the sense to be ashamed.
Not really – the “right” politicians know that their voters care more because it is these voters footing the bill rather than being the recipients of grift.

        The faces of Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner tell the tale. Karen’s slush fund has kept them and their party entrenched for some time now. Hardest hit will be NoVa McMansion builders and Aldi dealerships. Of course, elected Republicans and their princesses also received enough of the grift to keep their mouths shut. Go thirty miles outside of D.C. and literally no one gives a damn about USAID.Where this gets more serious is the revelation that the massive and deadly BLM riots in 2020 were financed in large part via USAID. Yes, the private donors will disappear now, but a lot of corporations will be implicated in financing the death and destruction. Add to the mix how much money flowed to finance the Covid madness, and it amounts to a truly embarrassing shareholder meeting or two.As an aside, based on polling we are probably in the last few years of hyper philo-Semitism in the United States (it never was that severe in Europe). Young people loathe Israel. This means AIPAC money will dry up, too. Without these two cash troughs, we will witness some interesting changes in how our politics work. “But, Soros?” Naah. He was getting more from USAID than he donated to the whores who directed funds to it. The man and men like him always get a return on their investments. They will move on to the next suckers.

        The current system simply works too well for the elite for it to be broken up. Conservative Inc and the Republican legislature benefits from the vast patronage system as much as the Democrats.No one at the top does not want a slush fund for their pet projects nor do they want their kids to have to go out and work at a job with a near starvation wage of say 150k. That just won’t do.How can they buy 1.5 million + homes in the right neighborhood without a job that pays what the children of the right people are worth? My God, on less than 300k what are you supposed to do, shop at Target? I don’t think so!

                Intra-elite war is how both social and government change happens. Populism does matter in so much the best reformers will make sure the plebs are on their side. So it’s Trump leading the Tech Bros and parts of the Israel collation with popular support on several issues against the rest of the elite.  Given popular sentiment, USAID will have to regroup as something entirely different to make come back.

        As demonstrated on this blog, the dissident community has a lot of brain power that is substantially targeted at analysis, with a small dollop of forethought that passes for tangible action. And it’s certainly true that there are real limits to what can be said on the internet (putting a target on your back is stupid). But that doesn’t mean you can’t think about real solutions and share them euphemistically. Ancient wisdom . . . hope for the best, but plan for the worst. It will get real and it’s best to be ready when it does.

        I don’t know about you all, but my colleagues at work and I have been positively gleeful this week.Although I’ve been a Trump optimist for a long time (especially after the phony indictments), this is like waking up Christmas morning when you were 7 and you not only got the cool GI Joe action figures you asked for, and the jet, but behind the tree is that aircraft carrier and six other vehicles.The past 3 weeks has quite literally been everything I’ve said needs to be done and have been writing about here and elsewhere for decades.The only thing missing – for now?  Criminal charges.DOGE has become a criminal investigation: embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering, securities fraud, campaign finance fraud, sedition…and that’s just USAID.

            Blackpilling is difficult lately, even for dedicated blackpillers. Trump has exceeded all expectations, even those of the optimists. And we’re not even 3 weeks in yet. I think most still haven’t yet wrapped their heads around the enormity of what is happening, even those who think they have, probably haven’t. If there’s a dark lining to any of this, it’s that the tech lords aren’t doing it for free.

                The dark lining is that 50% of the country works directly or indirectly (contractors) for the government. Plus all the government-adjacent industries like TurboTax prep services and all manner of “compliance” officers.
In their glee to cut the bureaucracy, there will be tens of millions of unintended consequences. The coffee shop owner in Georgetown and self-made millionaire who owns four stores can’t sell expensive lattes to unemployed FBI agents who are sitting at home.

                        Or the TBTF “Great Recession”?  I often point out that I was visiting McLean, VA way back then just prior to Christmas.  Full malls, full restaurants.  Luxury cars.  “There is no recession in Washington,” I wrote at the time.  Back home in CO…empty malls, boarded up store fronts.
That being said, don’t underestimate the impact on the honest half of the country.

                    “but there is going to be PAIN.”
Small and localized pain, yes, but for everyone else, it would be like having a massive credit card debt eliminated. 30% carrying costs wiped out overnight. That pain would be dwarfed.
And it ripples through all sectors of the economy as all that dead weight has to economize. Don’t think of it as a housing collapse. It’s just popping a bubble.

        The story from this commercial is instructive; a technocratic world with no whites and isolated single women who interact only through the screen learning from black men how to improve their bagged lunch as they work for the nation of Amazon.

in really don’t think anyone one purposed group or individuals could plan this it’s too perfect. Compare the Amazon comertial above to this other tech commercial from the 80s promising that technology was going to free man:

                Disgusting propaganda.  And overtly anti-Christian.A standard trope of luciferianism is inversion of the created order.  The strategy neuters the male, because the female is much more credulous and maneuverable, controllable largely as a collective, or herd.Yes there are monetary reasons as well — wage depression and so forth — but at heart this is spiritual warfare designed to destroy the family and prohibit the bonding of the father and son. This, their cult hates and fears most of all.The male is the fighter and much more wary and dangerous.  Adam was not attacked directly, but via the agency of the female.

                        Sounds like a lotta castration.The Ephesian Artemis (Diana), for example, boasts an entire gown made of bull’s balls.  Fetching!  The bull represents the male principle so figger it from there.Unsurprisingly, Diana’s acolytes largely were — make that are — women.  Castration having come back into vogue via single women and defenseless boys.  Leaving the self-emasculation of homos aside.Acts 19 cites the Ephesian Diana as an ‘image fallen from heaven’, a fem-goddess icon not unlike the Black Stone of the Kaaba.Feminism is almost as old as humanity.  It just cycles around with new names and faces.  Sometimes it even pretends to be patriarchal.

                    You certainly have the spiritual side of this covered. I tend to notice more secular aspects. For instance, a lot of the agenda of the “business elite” seems oddly to be focused on the endless pursuit, not of “excellence” or even profit (what the Left derides as “greed”) but “just good enough”. Replace smart men with dimwitted women, replace American IT guys with Indians, replace well made American goods where parts are machined with Chinese knock offs using stamped components. It’s always seems that the replacement product or person is just good enough, but not as good as what they replaced.The only kind of marketplace where this is actually a winning strategy is the various “ghetto” markets. If the customer is stupid or just doesn’t know that the products he’s buying are garbage, he’ll continue to spend money and the cost cutting businesses will prosper. In those markets, investing in quality just ends up cutting into profit margins and resulting in slower growth. The ultimate form of this strategy is to replace smart, discerning customers with morons. This may be a lot of the reason for the Great Replacement itself.

                    There was a book or ‘study’ whose summary was that, since husbands, uncles, grandfathers, and grown sons rule the clan, females- being the weaker sex- instinctively band together in quiet rebellion to subvert that rule, while currying favors individually.

                        It’s up to the men to put it a stop to it, regardless. Women don’t band together very well by the way, from personal experience. There might be a zombie effect, but it’s not the same as deliberate organization building. And indeed men by default are the ones capable of building public institutions. Even the worst man in an organizational role is almost always better than a fair woman because he’s got male instincts working in the background.

No, women didn’t start up the industry. Maslow and Bernays, for instance, were not women.
Note, however, especially you religious types- what do Maslow and Bernays specialize in?  Appealing to your fears and desires.

            Interesting that the great liberator was a blonde with a lesbian haircut. Still smoking hot, but the great liberator of those stuffy white men would be the sexually liberated woman. Even that was very subversive.The Prime one is taking aim at Japan. I hope they stay strong. They really want Japan to commit ethnic suicide. I saw an American Conservative article bashing Japan to let in old age care home workers. One of the arguments is that children caring for their parents is an even bigger drain on productivity that they can’t afford.It always goes back to the international banks. They want to keep those payments coming no matter the cost to everyone but themselves. “The Woke”, was an ingenius multi-faceted war. It got some aspects of the left to get off of the Sucking Squid putting the light on these international bankers and onto criticizing “Woke.”It got them off the trail. Now DOGE is going to uncover a lot and what will be seen can never be unseen.

        The fact that the Wall Street Journal is engaging in this behavior is another reminder that “conservatism” was part of the fraud.
Buckley was “former” CIA. “Buck” Sexton, one of the guys who took over Limbaugh’s show after his death, is “former” CIA. Quite a coincidence.

                    One doesn’t even have to be all that intelligent to figure this stuff out, either. Even under thevery best of circumstancesany charitable organization must have, at a minimum, various unavoidable overhead costs such as salaries, rental or ownership costs of buildings, cost to store and transport goods (if that were part of their operation), etc.Alas, the real world imposes additional costs: even if those operating the charity were entirely honest [laughter] none of that aid is going to reach its final destination without some greasing of palms at the receiving end. Some of that might be legitimate transit costs, but a good portion will be what we’d call bribery, although other cultures may well consider that a necessary change to do businesses. Padding expenses, a “job” for somebody’s nephew or daughter-in-law and a few Gulfstreams for the home office deduct further from available funds.The sad truth is that only a fraction of the dollar Joe Six-pack donates ever is used for its claimed purpose. I don’t have figures, but I’m sure someone does, about the proportions of these various costs in the average organization. I conjecture a third of the total receipts go to salaries and benefits alone.

        The doxxing of the DOGE kid is a reminder that woke has not gone away, it is only in remission. At best, disparate impacts will be (temporarily) permitted by the Colorblind Meritocracy, but fundamentally challenging the blank slate will not be, nor will Whites be allowed to express, let alone act upon, an explicit preference for their own race.
After Trump has served his purpose, which is to legitimize Greater Israel and delegitimize any perceived expression of “antisemitism”, woke will be back, with a vengeance.

                    Trump is a Boomer. We’re in the transition era, where the older establishment is trying to keep itself in place. JD Vance will not be as interested in cozying up to Jews.The Jewish century (with some overlap in both directions) was about an almost total control/influence over all the important institutions of government, business, and society. That’s crumbling around us…from Hollywood to school to government. In so much that it’s ending, some issues might get worse for a while.But ultimately, Gen Z doesn’t have time or the will to worry about the most privileged group on the planet.

        I don’t knownif anyone noticing the explosion of “dissident voices”. Some are  pushing this “we are in the verge of a technical revolution” others are trying to make clear that the race thing , ie one world one race is morally necessary .
its possible a new media will start cropping up to manage all this but keep the worship of tech and meritocracy.

Regarding Mr. DLS’s statement: two or more facts are true but there is generally a natural hierachy of facts in terms of consequentiality pertaining to the specific process. A more succint term would be “order of operations”.

                        Let’s call it a truism. Regardless of semantics, however, the reason for all those downvotes is your entirely unwarranted claim that Z has abandoned demographic concerns in favor of anti-government rhetoric. He’s done nothing of the sort. And it is worth noting that FedGov is largely responsible for the demographic catastrophe that befell America. Laying waste to FedGov then can be seen as vengeance for the demographic swamping.

                I’m more and more convinced that “ideology” is always a camouflage for a who/whom question. There is some core group of, shall we say, “demographically similar” people who are mostly after power and wealth. For them the ideology is a vehicle they ride to that destination. Then there’s a much larger outer group of dupes who actually believe the ideology who may not be anything like the core group. Some of the outer group may also be cynical about the ideology and simply virtue signalling for career reasons. Then you have the biggest group of all, which is the masses.Once a revolutionary ideology becomes triumphant it needs a propaganda and enforcement machine to keep the masses at least compliant and quell any questioning spirit that may develop among the core or outer group. Our society is essentially a post-revolutionary one just as Russia was after the Bolshevik revolution. USAID and similar NGOs, along with the three-letter agencies are part of the propaganda and enforcement machine. They also help to spread the ruling globohomo ideology to the rest of the world. Think of them as analogous to the various Communist parties in the mid 20th century along with the KGB andComintern. Trump and Musk are attempting to defund and expose this machine, which most people are still just learning about. They’ve pulled back the curtain that was hiding the little man at the control panel.
