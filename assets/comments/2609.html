        I want to say the weird shared empathy stuff started with Oprah.  The social media and ubiquity of the internet took it to another level completely.

        Usually when a feminist discusses rape she finds some way to blame all men.  I even get the feeling that is in fact what she believes and the rape issue is just an excuse to dump on all men.  I believe the percentage of men who “rape” a women in this country is actually quite low, but whatever that number is the percentage of men who do not “rape” a woman is very high, perhaps 98%  It just seems very odd to discuss it in terms of “all men”.

        “The weird thing with this talk is that the woman giving it is getting all the credit for being a sympathetic victim, without actually being a victim.”I her eyes, and in the eyes of her ululating sisterhood, she is a victim not because of what happened to her, but because of who she is.  She is a victim because she is a woman.  She was born that way.Mark my words, you will soon see women signing up for gender reassignment surgery, not because they see themselves as men having been born in a woman’s body, but because they see themselves as women having been born in a victim’s body.  They will attempt to change the patriarchy from within by becoming men physically, while retaining their superior feminine sensibility.  Lesbianism and strap-ons are half-way measures – it’s going to take women with dicks to effect real change!  Obamacare will, of course, pay for it.

        “At 21, when my friend and I were walking down the road one afternoon, a man pulled down his pants and masturbated in front of us. We called people for help, and nobody came.”If they had called people to watch, I’ll bet they could have amassed a crowd.I’ll give her credit, she’s talking about India here, the nation of Gandhi, the tolerant nation of yoga, meditation, and vegetarianism, a long-time favorite of anti-American, anti-Western hippies and hipsters, that is actually a Third World cesspool of institutionalized racism, sexism, and class bigotry, and which just recently made homosexuality illegal.  Usually one of these harridans would be describing her soul-crushing junior year at Yale, where the full horror of the barbarous American patriarchy finally revealed itself on a fraternity pool table after twelve shots of Cuervo, while using her transformative summer abroad in empyrean Bangalore as beatific contrast.By all means, let these hags bitch about India.  While they are at it, they can bitch about Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, and Iran, and other medieval backwaters where women and homosexuals actually have cause for complaint.  It’s a hell of a lot more productive than protesting at Brandeis because Ayaan Hirsi Ali, whose genitals were mutilated at age five, and who fled an arranged marriage, said something nasty about Islam.

        Well, there’s no denying that the little murderers of Pol Pot’s regime were passionate in their “excitable, emotional, impulsive, zealous, impetuous, violent” seeding of the killing fields.  The bed wetting lunatics just pave the way for the more determined passionates.

        I imagine people go to events similar to TED talks (and watch on the ‘net, too) because they believe — or hope — they about to discover something profound.But there is a real chance the talker or performer isn’t profound at all. No insights, nothing new to warrant being there and no return for investing the time. If this person on stage says something that a watcher can work out for themselves then as an ‘active audience member’ the listener/viewer has to defend themselves. They must invest enthusiasm, otherwise hearing people spout trivialities is simply just a waste of time.A lot of passion then comes from defending this waste of time. While it might be better to say “that was nothing special” the audience member has to pump up the event. It has to be tagged as ‘special’ or ‘insightful’ or even ‘life-changing.’ The temptation to be honest can quickly be masked by applause and enthusiasm and eager nodding, later stated as ‘passion’ for some issue.
