        You notice as a people becomes more deracinated with nothing to link them together, putting them all in a conference room will force everyone to embrace banal platitudes that are free of information and depth to avoid leaving anyone out. As our government and people become a mess of economic units, it’s pointless to talk about core values, as there are none. Sure, they’ll say something about “our core values” but if you push what they mean they will shut right up.The lack of common morality alongside fear of offense has created a culture where only silence or empty speech is acceptable.

            Interesting point. However, the propaganda tsunami we confront daily is replete with nothing but values. Even as little as 20 years ago, how often did you see “We believe…” signs in front yards? Oh, there are values alright. You can’t swing a dead cat what that you hit them. And they revolve around diversity, perversity and demonization of whitey.

                Nah, they’re just empty platitudes.  People don’t believe in anything but the path of least resistance.  Its like a tea party rally i went to back around 09 or so.  Was curious so i went.  Was greatly dissapointed, bunch of state republicans saying stupid quotes from jefferson and such that everybody already knows.  I don’t want to hear quotes i already know, i want to hear policy.

                    “Empty Platitudes”  Just so.  I went to a Palin rally when she was the VP candidate and was completely underwhelmed by the empty platitudes they gave her for a campaign speech.
The only politicians I have heard in person who deviated from empty platitudes were Paul LePage and Donald Trump.
Paul LePage:  “Here’s my energy policy:  If you’re cheap, we like you.  If you’re expensive, we don’t like you”.
Donald Trump:  “We’re gonna bomb the shit of out ISIS”.
Both are businessmen, first, and politicians by chance.

                    If you’re merely trying to go along to get along, you don’t post signs in your front yard. These people are fanatical believers in a deranged set of values. Thinking otherwise is a cope.

                        Yes, but we’re all segregated to a large extent.  If you live in a city, its going to be almost all democrat, they all work in healthcare, higher ed and secondary ed or belong to some .gov approved union.  You’ll have a few conservatives sprinkled in for flavor but that is it.  Trust me i know, i had a neighbor in 2020 telling me about how if biden wasn’t elected in 2020 nazis would spring from the earth.  They’re just showing to their fellow idiots they belong.  Like going to a sporting event and wearing your teams colors, even though that has no outcome on the game.

                            Wise move. I’ve said it before, I refuse to live in a city that has an NFL, MLB or NBA franchise. Invariably, those places are festering hives of scum and villainy. Life’s too short to live there, and might conceivably be shortened further still.

        In all fairness, after the Trump era is over, now or in 2028, right wingers will be nominating blocks of wood too. Things have gotten so polarized that, to be honest,I’dprefer a block of wood with a camo hat over whatever “leader” the Dems put forward.

            We are up to potus number 46.   it is next to impossible to have 46 people over a span of 200+ years and not one of them be a block of wood
I look at the super bowl as an apt analogy.  After 40+ of them, and the expansion of teams as analogous to the expansion of the franchise, you are bound to get a total sucky champion.

            “Things have gotten so polarized that, to be honest, I’d prefer a block of wood with a camo hat over whatever “leader” the Dems put forward.”Your comment fully encapsulate the complete and utter failure of the Trump era.He did absolutely nothing to deal with your replacement, and yet you guys worship him anyway.His cult of personality was so empty, there was no potential successor to follow him, and “dissidents” have resigned themselves to vote for the “Jeb Bush” of 2028.No initiative, no Imagination, just pathetic, meek, sad-sacks willing to lap up whatever goyslop the Zionists feed you.  Then your proud to be eating the red-flavored goyslop while jeering at those eating the blue-flavored goyslop.Sorry, but you losers deserve to see the end of your civilization.

                Ron Desantis is absolutely the right candidate. The problem is that the Roman mob wants a circus, not a sober-minded, intelligent debate. The Presidential debates should be serious back-and-forth between Desantis (as the leading executive on the Right) and Newsom (as the leading executive on the Left). Both have proven track records, and voters can decide whether they prefer Florida or California by comparing the respective states.
But no, instead we get “Idiocracy” – because the voters are all wearing Crocs and pajama bottoms, just like in the movie.

                    We’ve had 40 years of broken promises from the Recucklican Party. When that fool goes to Israel to sign a bill passed in the Florida legislature, you can’t blame people for being suspicious that they’re going to get more of the same. Better to stick with the circus that actually makes an earnest attempt to do what he said he was going to do, than more empty words from the Whigs.

His problem wasn’t sobriety.  It was support of the Ukraine war.  That, and other neocon-financed political positions doomed him.

        I think most everyone deep down knows and has come to accept that there are two facets to government, the public face of it which is Kamala and the guys in the boiler room actually running the ship — I.e. the technocrats.  If people actually believed Kamala was the one captaining the ship, they wouldn’t vote for her.any faith people have in the government is a faith in the technocrats to at least not crash us into an iceberg.   I believe they’ve already given up on the public face of the government and see it for the circus it is.The vote comes down to a vote of do you want stability in the technocratic sphere or do you want someone to come in a destabilize the inner workings?  Kamala is a vote for stability and lack of disruption in the inner workings of the machine.  That has considerable appeal to regular people. Even if they realize she is a ditz.the problems come when the people lose faith in the technocrats. When they make a royal screw up.  Maybe we’ve seen glimpses of their lack of competence, but. nothing catastrophic yet.so yes, people can at once see the presidential election as a circus while not letting that totally dictate how they feel about the government overall.  Because the social security checks still arrive.  The lights still work. But the technocrats are due for an epic fail.  That’s when things are certain to go wobbly.

Seriously?
Restraint by nonNATO world has thus far prevented catastrophe, not the actions of incompetents.
You can ignore reality but you can not ignore the consequences of ignoring reality.

                that is the conventional line, that it’s been the likes of Putin being the adult in the room that has prevented catastrophe.which is preposterous on its face because America is the one dictating what happens in the Ukraine.  And we haven’t seen catastrophe yet, as far as an american voter is concerned.  Meaning there are still rational thinking sober minded adults tucked away in the technocracy keeping us from getting in a nuclear exchange.And this is an American an election, not a NATO one, and what matters to voters is not what is going on in Ukraine or in the EU. What matters is that they can afford food and the social security pay,Mets come on time and EBT cards get replenished on schedule.

                    I would even take it a step further and say that rational-thinking sober-minded people are staffing the other crucial nodes of the system, such as in finance, engineering, and IT. My hope is that the smart set has been turning away from Washington and towards other nodes where you can make a difference without having to hob-knob with ambitious weirdos.
I imagine the person saying “after college I’m working in Washington” is akin to saying “after college I’m going to LA/NYC to pursue acting”.

                        All very true imo.  Insofar as the soberminded folks are manning the other levers of power but even that is being called into question.  At least on the finance side and media side.  Thankfully in America, at least where I live, we have top flight guys handling the electrical grid and the ones driving the trucks to,deliver the goods people still have faith in them.  Which really means they have faith in their neighbors and the local guys still getting things done right or right enough.   Which is why I think we are seeing the backlash to DEI because they know we can’t have people losing faith in the system in its entirety.  And hiring some DEI stooge to man the electrical system or the trucking or fed ex etc resulted in backlash.  People drew the line there or will start doing it more and more.  Doubtful that trickles upward into the political class any time soon.  But you never know.  Because we are one,Chernobyl away from the entire thing imploding.

                        I understand your pov, but it’s still incomplete.  America has also shown considerable restraint within the context of the situation.  As bad as the goading has been, it is wrong to say that America has shown zero restraint.  Yes america is bellicose and cocky and strutting around the world stage, but that’s who we are.  We are testing the limits,sure, and we might push things over the edge, but that hasn’t happened yet.  And that in itself is an indication of restraint — restraint American style.

                                No, not putting boots there on the ground en masse is a sign of restraint. Not giving zelensky everything he begs for is a sign of restraint.  Slow walking the increasingly more lethal weapons is a sign.there are a number of areas where america has been playing the crazy cowboy because that is its role on the world stage.  But that has not translated into a total lack of restraint.Putin knows that much of what we do is just peacocking.  And he knows that we are only dragging this out to create more opportunities for him to make a mistake that may turn the tide.  Just keep getting the ball over the net and wait for the other guy to make an unforced error, that is the American strategy

                                    You miss the point. Why goad a nuclear power that is minding its own business into war to begin with? Sober-minded, restrained people do not engage in such needlessly reckless behavior. But I guess when the Mongols sack Chengdu, massacring everybody but a few old men and infants, they are showing their restraint by leaving anybody alive.

Those are not signs of restraint – those are signs of inability.
They are signs that we can’t cash the checks our mouths speak.  Putin knows this, which is why he is biding his time letting self-implode.  Perhaps slow walking the weapons might be a sign of sort-of restraint, but more likely because the GAE can’t back up the other two, so has no choice.

                            Respectfully, that is not constraint from AINO. It is fear of going too far. Yes, the great herds of true-believer human cattle don’t see any need for caution, but their cattle masters, while not as intelligent as their predecessors a century ago, are still far more evil than they are stupid. They know their plans are coming undone. They are in the dissolution phase of trying to salvage what they can of their empire.

                                Perhaps, but isn’t inherent in the idea of restraint a fear of repercussions?   Or why else would one show restraint?
Granted, this can become a semantics argument which I don’t want to get into.

                                    Fear may have tempered the recklessness, but it is still recklessness and incredibly dangerous. Compare and contrast how the GAE has responded to the Ukraine with the steady hand it used against the USSR. The comparison simply isn’t there. How far out does the danger zone have to go before restraint is a laughable claim? I would say the precipice of nuclear war certainly is outside that zone, and it is hard to say we haven’t been brought to that point. Even during the Cuban missile crisis the GAE wasn’t funding an incursion into Soviet territory.Putin frankly would have been fully justified to have lobbed a nuke onto an inconsequential NATO country already to (a) demonstrate the GAE is a bully and paper tiger or (b) escalate upwards. Thankfully he has not. I have no desire to see myself and mine plunged into poverty and possibly killed. Yet that is where this alleged “restraint” has brought up–to the brink of nuclear war. The technocrats are just as dangerous as the public faces of the political puppets at this point. The man behind the curtain is just as insane as the one in front of it.

Except the whole Cuban missile crisis was precipitated by the GAE putting nukes in Turkey I am told.  So, same old, same old.

                                        To play Devil’s advocate, I would say that the Reagan policy of sending weapons to the Mujaheddin was a precedent for the current nonsense in Ukraine. The parallels are that you had a Soviet puppet state in Afghanistan and the US was arming the enemies of the regime. It’s not exact because the Mujaheddin did not control a state as does The Unfunny Comedian.The differences are clear though. The aid to the Mujaheddin was never anywhere near the scale of Ukraine aid which has grown to the point where it’s like a second defense budget. What I’m getting at is that the current Biden regime may think that the parallels are close enough to avoid catastrophe.Sensible and competent people understand that, as the old saying goes, “quantity has a quality of its own”. The current crop of GAE technocrats are neither sensible or competent of course.The “conservative” pro-Uke grillers may also think that the current Russian government is as fragile as the Soviet Union. This is probably where the fantasies about using the Ukraine war as a way to produce a color revolution in Russia. Of course, just the opposite is the case. The US is probably more unstable than Russia now in fact. For many people though, it’s forever 1985. Probably nothing short of total disaster will pierce their bubble.

                                            All fair and good points, but the biggest difference is that the Ukraine incursion and putting NATO on its border placed the Russian state under direct attack. Arming the Afghan jihadis was just another day at the office in imperial struggles. I cannot think of another time in the past when the American state has plumbed this depth of psychosis, but then again, this is AINO and it is deranged in every other aspect of its existence now.

                            America has shown little restraint in the context of the Russian/Ukraine war considering that it’s not our country , it’s not our interest or concern.   We have shown no restraint in arming Ukraine.   We invaded Iraq for far less a good reason and I saw no interference from major world powers.

                            “I think most everyone deep down knows…”Followed by your opinion, which neatly happens to line up with “what everyone deep down knows.”What if I’m the sort of person who is dubious about anybody who starts off a sentence with, “Let me tell you what everyone out there secretly knows…” You’re selling me something.If you worded it with less manipulation perhaps a coherent rebuttal would be offered. Also, I didn’t downvote you.Here’s my rebuttal: You have no idea what everyone knows deep down. It is humanly impossible. I know you don’t mean “everyone,” but you are indicating a mysterious sense of what most — or many, or a majority — are thinking. Mind-reading is unserious and an appealad populumto boot.

                    Without a severely restricted franchise, we needed management for our own good. The technocrats were doing Atlas’ work. Some still are, obviously. We need a reorganization. People take this Democracy! stuff too seriously. Lying to them and accommodating their delusion is proving disastrous.
I still believe in representative government, it’s part of my culture after all, it’s just that some people shouldn’t get very much representation.

No it won’t.  The general public was as involved in the stock market in the 20s as they are today with the exception of 401k owners.  People lost real money. The general downturn that followed was the worst in US history.  There were no social safety nets to help people get through the worst. No riots. No “revolt”  Only the election of FDR, which, I grant was terrible.

Power does not care what anyone wants other than when people want something power already wants to do.  This is why they allow protests for things they want and crush anyone protesting for what they don’t want.
Unlike the 1930s, the US in 2024 is a police state.  You can’t walk down the street without the government knowing about it.

                        Close to revolt, but which didn’t actually occur. Agree that the New Deal reforms were in place to turn the temperature down a bit. Reason I’m posting is to wonder why there wasn’t open revolt. My conjecture is there wasn’t a rival ideology in place. Without such an ideology, there’s only grumbling and discontent. Same thing now — MAGA is not a rival ideology. It’s just a meme. Maybe Z man will condescend to post on the topic of rival ideology some day.

War is the short answer.  Attention was moved from stagnate condidtions to an outward focus.  Same as it ever was.

                            Remember how you felt after 9/11?  Same as when people saw Pearl Harbor.  In fact i think it was wolfowitz who wrote in the late 90’s that the country needed a new Pearl harbor, curious eh?

                            With all due respect, Marxism was the ultimate rival ideology. And it was behind a good deal of civil unrest in the year 1919.

                            Sure there was.  The rival ideologies of Communism, Fascism and National Socialism all had a presence in America.  Though it’s arguable that Communism had at least a partial win, though this was a long term project.
The 1930s were a bad time all over the world. Britain didn’t fall. France didn’t fall and many other countries.  Really there is only Nazi Germany and things were very unique in Germany.  Spain’s troubles really had no connection to the great depression. The Fascists took power in 1922 in Italy.

                                “The rival ideologies of Communism, Fascism and National Socialism”Italian fascism was just corporate capitalism and after the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, German national socialism turned into something similar but with an emphasis on lebensraum. Communism was the only real alternative but US authorities stomped on it furiously over the years. The quickest way for any European immigrant to get deported was to admit he was a communist. “Better dead than red.” Maybe the last prominent socialist in the USA was Eugene Debs (?), who died in 1926. But I digress. To cut a long story short, the only alternative offered to the American peasantry is “reform”. which at best generally leads to a slight amelioration of conditions. These days we don’t even get that as we’re told (in the famous words of Margaret Thatcher) “there is no alternative.” This has become all the more forceful since the collapse of the Soviet bloc, which was an alternative system (I’m not saying it was a great or even workable alternative).

                            My conjecture is there wasn’t a rival ideology in place.
There was, but we went to war against it to save the Amish from the consequences of their Amish ways.

                    In fact what we’ve watched happen, as we’ve squandered natural resources on a lot of stupid consumer crap, is the slow dismantalization of the new deal.  We now have a hodge podge of handouts specifically to strangle revolt in the crib.  Not improve peoples lives, just keep their mouths shut with TV and internet and cheap shit.  Hell look at the food we consume, you think its better then 50 years ago?  As life becomes more expensive due to the lack of cheap energy the “socialism” we’ve always lived under (were you born in the 1910’s?) will give away to jungle law.  Already happening now.

That is what should anger alot of you, many people who vote democrat and work in large companies that rely on government money do absolutely nothing all day.  But are so stupid they can’t recognize that and puff out their chest like they’re actually contributing something.

                        America was 90% “white,” but it was not in any way a unified “White” country and it still isn’t.  There were ethnic enclaves and fiefdoms all over the place and intense rivalry between them.  A lot of the towns and cities had the cops beating up the transients looking for work and running them out of town.

                            Indeed, lots of billboards outside of towns telling people fleeing the dustbowl, dont stop here we can’t support you.  Also, were people from Italy, Poland, eastern europe and so on viewed as “white” back then?  I’d argue no.  If you’re looking for some interesting reading i’d suggest reading the book “Out of this furnace” which covers the steel industry in western PA and how immigrants fueled it.

                            Yet those folks from the Old Country shed their European identity and sought to assimilate to a common Americanism as quickly as they could learn English. Sure, the Wops still ate their pizza, the Micks still drank their Irish whiskey, and the Polacks still loved their kielbasa, but more than that they loved their new country. And they weren’t about to try to break it apart over old ethnic differences.

                                This just isn’t true, at least not to the extent you’re saying it. They lived in ethnic enclaves. They spoke their own language. They were separate communities. They ran their own fiefdoms.Also, the same thing applies to most of them as applies to outsiders today and that is, they aren’t us.  The media’s war on the word foreigner started back then.  When foreigners move in, they change the character of and eventually destroy a community.That’s not to say they weren’t a lot more compatible with the America which then existed compared to the foreigners of today and the America exists now.

                                    They formed enclaves as a matter of survival. The people spoke the same languages, and many of them actually knew one another and would help each other out. But this was a temporary expediency. As the second and third generations came of age, they merged into broader society because they were able to and wanted to. Hell, even those who remained behind became American in every meaningful sense of the word. If you go to Bensonhurst, you’ll feel like your in America–or what remains of it. Go to Dearborn, Michigan or Paterson, New Jersey, on the other hand, and you’ll get a very different sensation.

                                        That’s what it means to be a community.  They lost it anyway, mostly through marriage assimilation.  This was bad for them and it was bad for us too. It was one step on the destination we’re at now.  The past assimilation of Poles, Irish etc are used for excuses for the mass migration happening today.
I totally oppose the assimilation of today’s foreigners through intermarriage (I’m not saying you are proposing that).

                                    The other thing is that public schools indoctrinated them with “Americanism,” taught them how great George Washington and our white Founders were, and made them speak English. And if they were sick or needed welfare they were put back on the boat at Ellis island and sent back home.They were brought here to make the capitalist swine rich with their cheap labor, but there was no tolerance for them if they started stirring up shit like Emma Goldman or Sacco and Vanzetti.Today’s nonwhite immigrants are intended to enrich the political fortunes of the Democratic Party, which is the party of the welfare state and government bureaucracy. The more helpless and useless and dependent they are, the better.

                Yes. People have internalized that politicians are mere puppets and relatively powerless.  What they have not internalized, and this is evinced by a 35 trillion debt, the precipice of nuclear war, and wide-open borders–is that the bureaucracy and the system that controls the public faces also are in rapid decline and not that much more competent at this point.

The problem is the technocrats, while not having crashed the ambulance, and eroded the foundations of society through mass immigration and degeneracy to the point where its becoming a depressing, sh8*ty place to live.  Relatively stable, but sh**ty.

                        Not at all.  Most of the great slave plantations harvesting teak and hardwoods in Brazil were owned and run by Sephardi.  That’s where the land baron system came from.The “twentieth family” came with the Conquistadors, and many were no doubt Conquistador contractors themselves.  They were pushed out of Isabella’s Spain, and set up shop in their former allies Moorish lands.  (“20th family” is the merchant family that supplied the other 19 colonial families.)Another clue is how the slaves died by the thousands, not just from disease.  The traders had reverted to form.  They also masss converted the Indians to Crown Christianity as they mass converted us to Democracy.

            We’re post ethnic but we still have implicit tribal allegiances via genetic similarity, it’s been like that since the beginning but now it’s much messier. I noticed from a young age that there was a pattern to who I organically became friends with, despite in some cases being totally foreign races we all descended from similar environmental conditions.In my case people I have a natural affinity for those who hail from unstable ecology that selected for extreme aggression being employed on short notice. So southern Italians, highland Scots, nomadic caucasians spanning multiple races some veering into arab admixture, short tempered Germans, hard Right hispanics, Brits who are living embodiments of the Norf FC meme &amp; militant Irish. Despite the racial disparity all these types agree far more than they disagree on what kind of society they want to live in. If someone did a poll that asked if violent criminals should be executed on the spot I’d bet my life on it that the demographics who would support that would overwhelmingly be made up of the ethnic/sub ethnic groups I just listed.Trump drew all these people together almost exclusively due to his personality &amp; in spite of his policies that ended up being anathema to what we wanted. Unfortunately that’s not very common, most politicians are the antithesis of that &amp; not just because of his personality but due to deliberately projecting a bland persona to avoid alienating voters.The Trump phenomenon does however demonstrate that multi ethnic coalitions can be made by proxy. That’s essentially always been the case but very few ever bothered to look at the individual races &amp; tribes instead focusing on the most broad proxy elements like urban versus rural, north versus south, coastal versus heartland etc. The closest the mainstream ever comes to divvying up the proxy tribes is looking at single issues like the 2nd amendment example I mentioned earlier.Unfortunately in actual practice you’re spot on, Trump was both a one off &amp; also proved to a total coward. My “we” has no political representation &amp; I’m in good company with that. Worse is the fact that aside from my pro White stance I have very little in common with most of the people that constitute the Dissident Right. The fact we’re going to be electing blocks of wood going forward suggests a very bleak future in regards to political identities &amp; their tribes by proxy.Hopefully some day these various tribes can go their separate ways &amp; return to a pre America colony system. Forcing all of these disparate groups to live together in a union you could never leave with a federal government every tribe was vying to control to force their vision on everyone against their will created this mess in the first place. A truly homogeneous country wouldn’t have a bloody civil war that ends with one side subjugating &amp; ethnically cleansing the other less than a century after its founding.

                Trump lost every demographic except White people.  The multi-ethnic coalition is a dream that is unlikely to happen anytime soon.
While I don’t really have any particular animosity towards Arabs or Hispanics, they are never going to team up with whitey except in specific instances where it will temporarily serve their interests.  This is why they must go back.

                    Pointing out that Trump united several different European ethnic groups with a similar background along with the micro minority of brown people who aren’t hardwired leftists during his first run for president was not me shilling for brown people.Neither does pointing out that different Euro races are distinct &amp; are not an amorphous group of people fully united due to hailing from Europe imply that I think the majority of brown people will lock hands with sane Whites.If that were true then half the White population in the US wouldn’t be voting for savage supremacy every election.I honestly don’t know how you got any of what you projected onto me in your reply which was essentially in full agreement save for the possibility that a political coalition based on proxy interests could be formed. I can only assume you disagree with me on that solely because I acknowledge a small minority of brown people with similar views would want to associate with it just as they did with Trump during his first term. I only mentioned that detail to further demonstrate just how post racial our political landscape is due to the sheer number of races &amp; tribes existing in this country.I’m arguing “we” is possible in theory as demonstrated by Trump’s first run even though I acknowledge you’re right, in actual practice that will never happen or if it does it’ll be a repeat of Trump’s backstabbing once they reach office.To expand on that in the opposite direction I sincerely doubt he had many people who hail from Sweden voting for him in 2016. Call me crazy but I’m inclined to believe the people who enjoy flooding their country with somalis &amp; whose diaspora are doing the same exact thing in the US where they congregate in large numbers had a positive view of Trump back then. That’s just one example of a Euro ethnic group who I believe will never join a political coalition that’s even remotely pro White or designed to benefit White interests &amp; are collectively but not necessarily individually an enemy race to people like myself.There’s copious amounts evidence that things are a bit more complicated than a simple White versus brown dichotomy. You may disagree but I maintain that saying as much doesn’t make me a shill for brown people.

                        First, I never called you a shill or otherwise impugned your motives. I just assume you said what you believe and without hidden motives. I didn’t downvote your comment either, I almost never do.I agree with you that Whites are not a unified group.  There are many ethnic differences between various white ethnic groups.Winning a minority of brown votes is worse than those brown people not being here.  If the US can be saved, they must go back.The “brown” people mostly are first or second generation at most, have an ethnic identity, can speak their home tongue and have citizenship to their mother country.  They can be sent back.  Swedes cannot. They have been here many generations, have no foreign identity, don’t speak the language and have no foreign citizenship.  Furthermore, they tend not to be full Swede. This is the same of almost every white ethnic group in the US.  Even countries with the supposed right of return, like Germany won’t take them.Last, I don’t oppose brown people living here for political reasons or at least not solely for that reason.  I don’t want to live near them. I don’t want them (their kids) trying to date or rob or beat my children. I don’t want to smell their food cooking.  I don’t want their habits and customs. I don’t want their ethnic fiefdoms.  I don’t even want to look at them.  I want my kids to have native English speaking teachers so they can understand what they are saying. I want a normal country, not an empire.

                            First of all thanks for the response clarifying things, having read what you said here I can understand why you said what you said.I’m not to be confrontational, I’m just pointing out that I think you think I’m bringing up brown people in a subversive manner.I was just saying in an electoral context the only way to get anything that would good for Whites would have to be by proxy due to the shitty situation we’re in &amp; it’d ironically include a small amount of brown people supporting it &amp; whole lot of Whites being against it.I mentioned the other White races in context of the fact some of them are effectively brown people when it comes to voting. They’re so populous in addition to the brown hordes that it’s easier to ignore race &amp; just filter based on specific issues &amp; that this flaw also plagues the pro White demographic.Even among us we’re all pro White but we’re all subject to the same dividing lines, agreeing on this one issue isn’t enough to form a coalition. Now having said that &amp; having mentioned brown voters I could definitely see how it could come off as me saying that we need those brown voters &amp; everything that suggests. But I’m not, I’m just saying vague racial distinctions isn’t enough, in my opinion I think we need to filter down even harder past the generic White race concept. I mentioned the races I get along with because even among ourselves we have divisions. We’re all pro White but we’re all subject to the same dividing lines, agreeing on this one issue isn’t enough to form a coalition.Right now we’re in a proxy racial or more accurately genetic war between those who want to live in a first world &amp; those who want to mix themselves &amp; civilization itself into mud. On one side is mostly Whites &amp; the other is half White &amp; half brown. Those Whites also have political view averages the same way brown people do. For political purposes it’d only need to focus on that by proxy.I was just saying in theory there could be a “we” by proxy but ultimately I agreed with you that in practice there won’t be. There’s way too much division because of all those separate races &amp; I think that was always a problem from day one in America, why I lamented the end of the colonies which were very racially segregated- I don’t want to live with Swedes anymore than I do with a brown person. They’re the same to me since the former leads to the importation of the latter.All that is me reiterating what I originally meant in my first reply which I now see why you read it that way just clearing that up. I meant no disrespect in the last reply &amp; I didn’t assume you downvoted me, you don’t strike me as someone who is passive aggressive. I didn’t think about the wider context of how that could’ve came off as with people constantly trying to push subversive talking points about brown people.I apologize if that last reply came snippy, it seemed like projection in that exact moment but I can see why you responded the way you did now. That’s my fault, I should’ve been more clear on what I was saying.

            The point of managerialism is to smother the basic realities of human organization in mountains of technocracy so that there is no room to ask, “who are we”?
The (((technocrats))) do not want us asking the question because the answer is that “we” are not Jews and “we” are not Israel and therefore “we” should not be paying for Bibi’s wars and Zelenskyy’s war.

        We’re now in the age of Redefinition. Redefine what the meaning of vaccine, marriage, sex, gender, consent, legal age, what constitutes unemployment (someone with an extra part-time job equals 2 people fully employed) or a crime (so they can say crime is down) is. Bill Clinton called it when he said it all depends on what your meaning of the word “is” is.

            Chalk that one up to postmodernism, ol’ pal. When language allegedly does not correspond to reality, those in power are free to actually unmoor it from reality. Reality then becomes whatever they say it is.

        I remember after obama got elected a second time some comedian joked that the US would vote in a series of ever more ridiculous people until getting fed up with humans altogether &amp; electing a chimpanzee. Leading up to that there’d be all this discussion about how monkeys deserve human rights which would become enshrined into law &amp; ultimately lead to a monkey ruler.That was funny because it was making fun of the crazies who seemed ridiculous at the time but those same types of people are now the norm in positions of power. That we have a supreme court justice who claims to be a woman while simultaneously being unable to say what a woman actually is seems like an omen of what’s to come.I remember the media painting critics of gay marriage as hysterical loons for claiming it would lead to legalized beastiality &amp; pedophilia. That seems quaint &amp; unimaginative compared to the now common practice of mutilating children.

                    Pres. Trump’s shortcomings are know to many. However, he did undo NAFTA and kill the TPP abomination, hence is worthy of a modicum of respect. Hence, while I won’t by default write out “President” I will for him write out “Pres.” Heels-up-Harris, on the other hand, merely warrants a “P.”
Since she is such a ho she doesn’t warrant default “Heels-up-Harris” I abstract her name to simply “Ho.” Therefore, she is “P. Ho.” Tampon Timmy also does not warrant the effort of a full label, so he gets called “TT.”
P. Ho and TT 2024! May it all burn.

        I’ve watched most of it and the one thing the speakers are obsessed with is abortion. Even though it’s legal in the activists’ home states, they want to force it on Mississippi and Alabama. Planned Parenthood even put a van outside the DNC offering abortions and vasectomies. Well, that means there will be many fewer activists in 20 years.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/19/planned-parenthood-free-emergency-contraceptive-abortion-vasectomies-dnc/74855652007/

            The abortion issue is so stupid. There are as many obsessed with keeping it widespread as there are invoking the anger of God. Hello?! 1995 called!
I would not want to be stuck in an elevator with either party.

        I don’t know how or when, but the managerial class and their bureaucracy needs to die.
I believe Covid-19 was an appetizer for what Nature/Reality has in store. The way all those people panicked like the boy who cried wolf over what was essentially a very nasty flu makes me believe the next time they really will all die.
It is time. It is time for Nature to come in and cleanse the filth of managerialism from our societies. If the Devil exists, he is a bureaucrat through and through. For dealing with bureaucracy truly is hell.

        Why do they hate Putin? I used to think it was because he wouldn’t let the GAE steal Russia’s resources. But now I think its much worse. Sweden is supposed to be the first domino. The Africans, when signaled, shall rape and pillage that country thereby ordaining the transition to tyranny (the cucks will demand it!). But what if the few remaining Scandinavian swinging dicks ask Russia for help? And he sends a Christian battleforce across the northern border and they rout the dark rabble and cucks. And this example sets Europe ablaze in a frenzy of curative purging. What will Klaus Schwab do then? Die of course.

        Falcone is on to something important here, although I disagree with some of his conclusions. The political carnies are basically pitchmen and pitch women for the Deep State. And I agree that the black pilled get this. But the problem is that the Deep State is getting demonstrably less competent – Iraq, Covid, Ukraine, debt explosion etc. And instead of offering an opportunity for serious feedback via the electoral system, it gives us a Gong Show. Meanwhile a shocking proportion of otherwise smart normies think that the election is a serious, on-the-level event.

            On the one hand I too I have a hard time seeing the president being in charge of very much of anything, yet, it is a remarkable coincidence, that when GAE foreign policy reached peak (so far) levels of retardation, it happened during the term of just the kind of hubristic retarded blowhard you’d expect to be that retarded. Biden checks every box of my mental picture of the kind of president to blunder “us” into this mess. I envisioned him long before he arrived.

        Rush Limbaugh famously said after the 2020 fraud that, “Democrats are DONE with elections.”What was, in my youth, a generally republican system that had not been thoroughly corrupted, is just flat out dead now.  No sane person believes the election results are legitimate any more.  My local county election website considers such talk “disinformation” and derides anyone who says otherwise.  Nevermind that every single thing that is illegal at a voting center cannot be enforced at somebody’s house with a mail-in ballot.Even if Trump somehow “wins”, the margin will be tiny due to Democrat ballot-box-stuffing operations.  They will immediately claim that Trump committed election fraud and riot.  Nobody will call this insurrection.  The pearl clutchers will be laughed at as they cry “Hypocrisy!”Nobody is going to accept the election results.  MAGA’s who refuse will be jailed.  Democrats who refuse will have Matt Damon pay their bail so they can burn MAGA homes down.Democrats are done with elections.

        “…why conservatives want to make all immigration legal. That way, it does not violate the rules.”But yes it does in a very real sense.  This is the same sense that Libertarians are incorrect on open borders, and so are “Conservatives” and anyone else that promotes such folly—you cannot have open borders and a welfare State.  The two are contradictory and work at odds with each other.  As one increases, the other decreases.it was not always this way.  Prior to our present day society, immigrants were legal or illegal, and legal immigrants were ineligible for welfare benefits for the most part.  If they became indigent, they could be deported if family or sponsors refused to step in and support them.  Illegals were of course subject to immediate deportation when noticed, so they rarely even applied for welfare.So yes, we are arguing about whether or not we should have open borders, but really we are determining the fate of the welfare State.

On the contrary, that seems to me like the growing reality. The future is California. If the loldollars hold up. We like to think, I like to think, that we’ll have our redoubts, but nothing can stop the tide of the GR. As long as the loldollars hold up.

        What i find amusing about people clamoring for socialism, is the fact that the family unit is the most socialist thing humans have ever done.  Most of the people clamoring for it come from broken families, can’t make it work at the smallest scale, but think if they do it at the national level it will be a stunning success.  Stupid is as stupid does.

        Not sure how to cleverly segue this in, so it may or may not be off topic-
But I know why the Zealots are trying to start a war in the Middle East.
In 70 AD, provoking Rome was a way to bring the end times and the messiah.
But what a Mideast War is guaranteed to do, is to set woggy Muslim asses on fire in Europe, now that they have both the numbers and the outright support of the governments.
Arab Springs were stacking the kindling, time to light it.Will that be the broom?

        “Once you start thinking about how we ought to live, you then must confront the central question at the heart of every human organization and that is, who are we?”I was going to chide you for not bringing this up but then you did. We can’t talk about how to live until we determine who we are. If we determine that we’re a nation of people originally transplanted from Europe, and have the kind of genetic proximity that we don’t share with other peoples, then we can start asking on how we should live and what our destiny as a people might be.

            Bingo. There’s a woman who is into finance and personal well being that a friend of mine is real into named something  fits, maybe Catherine. I went to her living room talk (mostly women) but also a lot of fed govt employees there: fda, engineers, one voice of America software guy if you can believe it; not stupid people. All white, one Asian, maybe 30-40 people.topics ranged from the fed, to the who, the banks, food saftey  and especially Covid. She is really into how the end of cash will be the final way to control every aspect of our lives.but no talk of multiculturalism/ multiracialism. In fact fits mentioned the genocide in Palestine but said the Jews and the Palestinians should get together to fight the banks etc.  I brought up the “who are we” question after the event during dinner and  got very hostile reactions when they figured out that I was questioning whether non whites could actually be Americans.the racial thing is the big mental hurdle for whites. The brainwashing is deep deep down in our people souls.

                I recently went to a concert at a amphitheater in an affluent Salt Lake City suburb. Beautiful mountain views, buildings of brick, stone, and glass, all White upper middle class residents. I stayed in nice hotel in the middle of town. In the hallways of hotel I unexpectedly encountered multiple low class looking blacks straight from projects. They are are obviously being relocated by Uncle Sam to this pristine mountain town to destroy another Whitetopia. In past the government would have fallen all over themselves to protect a wealthy community like this from the riff raff. Now they are using third worlders as WMDs.

                    LDS Church fully in on the Browning, it’s the “Pearl of Great Price” controversy. It comes from all those missionaries in colorful tropical locations openly recruiting numbers.
PoGP is one of their secondary holy books, written about the time Joseph Smith was lynched and they were driven eventually to Utah.PoGP forbade marriage to Negros, and was countermanded in 1977 by ‘divine revelation’.  It was originally ‘discovered’ in response to the Civil War outcome.

        I can summarize everything in a lot less wordage:
They’ve given away so much power to the administrative state (unconstitutionally, I might add), there’s not really much that elected officials do anymore, at least at the federal level. The only thing they have left is foreign policy and even there, their wings have been clipped by what Alexander Vindman called “interagency consensus.” Maybe that’s why they are so inclined to start wars all the time. They don’t really have much else they can do.

        Without an encompassing moral code (religion) that encourages elites to act as sympathetic agents for their principals, the people of a nation, I don’t see how a system like this works. I like the idea of brooming them out, but who replaces them? Revolutions tend to replicate the system they replaced.

            History says that at some point, the elites turn on one another as the pie has become static. Once that begins to happen, they start looking for public support. Alternatively, the system becomes unstable, the elites crowd together until the system topples over.

            The ruling class does have a moral code that not encourages, but demands that they act as sympathetic agents for their principals. The stranger is their principal and the native is their enemy. So they pay, coddle, welcome and elevate the stranger and they are taking a broom to the citizen and native.Each faction has an incentive and an accompanying reasoning method and these are complimentary. One one incentive or reasoning is under attack they turn to the other one. The opposition is stuck in one reasoning – economic and legality as Z has been pointing out in this most recent string of posts.Some have ethnic hatred and revenge. Some use that for patronage. Some want to cover for their mismanagement by encouraging further decline masked by saving the earth. The plutocrats and alien oligarchs want to destroy the nation and finish buying it out and owning it remotely. The imperialists are scared to death of China and they see the only path to dominance as ever expanding GDP and ever more piles of flesh to keep expanding GDP and be on parity of human biomass with China and India.We aren’t suffering enough yet. Perhaps the looming Ukraine defeat will create shocks to the system that accelerate suffering. J. Burden recently pondered how far social engineering can go. How much longer can the white middle and upper middle class go before ignoring dispossession is plausible. SoAmerIndians are being handed the trades. Lower caste dots the hotel, petrol station, and shopmart franchises with advantages adn preferential loans. Word I hear and direct evidence I am seeing is that college grads, even those who did what they were told and learned to code at good CS programs, are struggling to find work even as the anti-immigration party is ready to staple green cards to aliens with diplomas.In effect, The Regime is waging a war against the native using the alien. It may not even be appropriate to say they are handing it away. I did a cursory search the other day, and the number of aliens who run many of our corporations and the number who are running the replacement invasion NGOs is a very sobering thing to look at.I see yesterday’s post as highly correlated. White men getting lost in video games and 24×7 sports and gambling are being bled out. Eventually some with a bit of spirit left are going to have to erect a banner and take charge as Z has been alluding to.

                “Word I hear …”I’ve got a young relative who can’t find work, recent engineer graduate in a field that should be utterly awash with jobs if the GAE were taking its war with Russia seriously. Money IS being allocated, but the GAE can’t help being who and what they are, so most of the money is simply being stolen (in various legal ways) at various steps along the financial flow pipeline before it gets to the end stage of being spent on useful people doing actual work.I support this completely because while I understand our society is being retooled to serve lunatic GAE aspirations for planetary conquest, I don’t want it retooled effectively. Sucks to be young and unaware that you weren’t born into a real country, but into a grift zone that just parted you from most of your inheritance in the form of the enormous expense of a modrin edumuhcation. Willingness to bend the knee and serve the GAE is no longer enough, if you are white. Those who get eaten last, still get eaten. We are, at the end of this dissolution process, either going to be extinct or ethnocentric beyond the worst nightmares of the maggot people.

            Great point. The unifying moral framework of our people through religion was smashed hundreds of years ago. BUT, without a people to settle in, ie a more or less homogeneous people who can say who they are, there’s nothing to pour religion into anyways.
although if the right religion was imposed on the passport holders of the us, it would definitely be an improvement and something I wouldn’t complain about….yet

        all the clownworld stuff going on has made me wonder –
should we just hunker down and stay close to family and people we trust? Like if elections are pointless, why not just let the insanity burn itself out, while not expecting it to happen soon.

        “There is never any discussion about what is the morally right goal for economic policy. It is not that the issue has been settled, but that no one thinks it is appropriate to discuss it at all.”
True.  What percentage of the US population has even a rudimentary understanding of economics? It WOULD be inappropriate to discuss such matters with a bulk of Americans, important issues are simply beyond their depth.  Now, if you want a lively discussion on sportsball, abortion or other banal trivialities, that’s a different story.

Only some whites, asians, and j3ws can understand macroeconomics. The non-whites are happy to ignore fiscal responsibility to overthrow the whites. They are willing to sacrifice national prosperity towards this goal.
Economics is secondary to the DNA and racial homogeneity of the people.

        The famous “Voltaire” internet quote seems to have started a trend of attributing uncharacteristic quips to randomly chosen big names. They’re so misfit it seems intentional, a cultural literacy test. Do we remember our ancestors? Not at all (especially not Voltaire).There are coffee mugs accusing Frank Zappa of saying “So many books, so little time.” In real life he began his autobiography by warning that not only doesn’t he write books, he doesn’t read them. It wasn’t true—he made program music for Kafka and birthed “counterculture” interest in Cordwainer Smith, e.g.—but he didn’t have any catladylike sentiments about anything. So why him? Striking name. Everyone remembersit.Public intellectual Marx was very limited: dorky economic word problems, paeans to history™ (as mover), and saying victims of the actual existing system—bourgeois (the Jews who don’t run the world) and worker (America’s southern whites) alike—deserve it. If it’s not that, it’s not him.His entire literary corpus is free on the internet. Voltaire’s too. And Frank Zappa’s, illegally (two clicks away instead of one). Anyone can know everything they said.Therefore, we don’t. Weknowwhat Marxism is: Silicon Valley Indians pretending to be black.(Korla Pandit, ref. “Korla Plankton” in Zappa’s “Excentrifugal Forz,” was a black musician who made it by moving to California and pretending to be Indian. We’ve come so far…)

        “Everyone agrees that illegal immigration is bad, not because it is immoral, but because it violates the rules of technocracy. We know this because it has the word “illegal” in its name. It is whyconservatives want to make all immigration legal.“
You need to reword this. Because it’s sloppily written it conveys the wrong impression of what conservatives want regarding immigration. Above all, immigration needs to be controlled and selective. Moreover, laws on the books regarding the hiring of illegal aliens need to be enforced strictly, including prison sentences and big personal fines for offenders.

            I have never heard a mainstream conservative talk about ending chain migration, or the diversity lottery, or birthright citizenship, or to call out specific industries or companies (like Big Ag) for building on the back of illegal migrant labor. The talk to enforce E-Verify is just that, there was no provision for such in the much balleyhooed “bipartisan tough border bill” last year. That’s because conservatives don’t want to stop hiring illegals. So, no, conservatives do not believe that immigration should be “controlled” and “selective.” Z is correct on that point.Trump tried to push a European-style system for selective immigration and he got raked over the coals. He correctly pointed out that we get so many immigrants from third world shitholes and none from good countries and got lambasted by everyone. Of course, he’s not talking about that now. He is talking about stapling green cards to diplomas and saying everyone who isn’t a murderer or drug dealer should get in.

We may be in a pre political stage thanks to universalisms like all men are created equal and human rights.Look at Japan, I think they completely walled themselves off from the world for hundreds of years. If we are talking about a broom, sweep all moral should-ing aside. That’s how we ended up with so many non whites; some phony. Morality that said “ya can’t kick em out, that’s to break the fabric of the universe “ or something gay like that.Who says the us need any immigration? Shift it to eugenics.

            You are right that there are conservatives who want a strict meritocratic immigration system.
However, when that system is revealed to have a racially disparate impact, many of those conservatives will flee for fear of being called “racist.” You know it’s true.
But the worst problem with their system is that most of those talented foreigners that take the jobs from native whites do NOT believe in meritocracy. They believe in hiring those of their own race.
It’s tragic how blind you guys are, however well-intentioned. In general, only whites are capable of transcending race and it will be our downfall.

            Disagree, it’s perfectly written. Fungible humans is called frangibility; corporatist technocrats need components, cogs, and consumers.
Frangibility promotes empty vessels, who can recite the day’s slogans and follow the day’s orders. Frangibility means you think you can replace one thing with another and expect it to be the same thing.
A rose is not a rose, everything is the same as everything else.
