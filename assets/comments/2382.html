        Given recent history, it is increasingly difficult, I find, to distinguish between the mindset of fanatical Liberals and the mindset of fanatical Muslims.  The gulf between what I think and what they think is so wide, both groups would much prefer to decapitate me than to debate me over our differences.  These days I try to steer a wide berth of both groups of fanatics.
