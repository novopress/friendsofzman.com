        When Dick Cheyney said “We (USA) create our own reality”, it was really no different from some Prog calling a man in a sundress a woman. Both accept no limits (classic hubris) and are fundamentally reckless. So it’s a Cloud-Dirt dialectic in another form. As some clever guy said “You can ignore Reality, but you cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring Reality”. If Prudence is anything, it’s about accepting Reality.

            And Reality doesn’t go away even when you stop believing in it.  One of the best lines ever.  Thanks Zman.

                Z: The Covid vaccine is a great example of the recklessness of medicine. Even a little bit of prudence would have avoided this easily avoidable error…Reality doesn’t go away even when you stop believing in it…For anyone who hasn’t seen it yet, you simply must watch John Campbell’s new video, concerning USA deaths in the 25yo-44yo age range.Excess deaths in young adultshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHpvhZFvUl4The paper has been accepted by JAMA:https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829783https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/articlepdf/2829783/wrigleyfield_2025_ld_240295_1737666979.93197.pdfThe youtube video has more than FOUR THOUSAND comments.John Campbell, in closing: “We need complete freedom to discuss why we are burying and cremating people in what should be the prime of life.”﻿

            I think it was Karl Rove who said that. But it was probably because he heard somebody like Cheney say it.

                Rove is a shrubite opportunist like Clitonista Carville without the irritating accent.  Ayn Rand said the thing about reality, ignoring it and the consequences thereof, not rove.

                It was Rove, but the reporter almost certainly massaged it to make it sound minatory. I’ve watched Rove talk for 25 years, and he doesn’t have that kind of cadence, vocabulary, nor depth of thought. He’s a campaign nuts and bolts guy with limited education, not Alexander Kojeve.

                    Keep in mind that Rove has denied saying it, and the reporter who says he did is, well, a reporter, and one of the worst. I don’t know how you guys can listen to a nitwit like Rove for decades and think he’s capable of articulating a thought like that.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_communityEdit: I mean, seriously — after the past 10 years and the past 10 days in Washington, there is no reason to believe any of these reporters any longer. Do you really think Karl Rove — Karl Rove! — said the following:“…solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.”Be honest.

                The quote is generally attributed to Philip K. Dick, an acid-dropping schizophrenic science fiction author who had a better grasp on reality than any of today’s libtards and rinos.

                    I recall PKD used amphetamines, not acid.  Speed often is popular with writers because they can go 2 days sleepless and on Full Dilithium Drive, then crash, then do it all again.  Hard on the bod but productive.
BTW Philip Kindred postulated that the Roman Empire never ended but is alive and well in America and the West.

            I’ve often wondered if the ascendancy of the techno class is what is warping our reality. You can code a computer to do whatever you want it to do. To a lesser extent, the legal community can also fashion their own reality.I wonder if working in that kind of an environment has warped the reality of the powers of be. I wonder sometimes if they think they can restructure the world and the immutable laws of nature and physics with a couple of documents and a stroke of a pen, like lawyers do when they create a non-profit that essentially operates like a for-profit company.Some of the things they’ve tried to do are really bizarre and that’s the only explanation I can come up with.

                I have long been contemplating same: our “thought leaders” (!) are almost contemptuous of gravity, and have been for some time now. Most of these are Silly People Who Revel in Being Smart-Aleks, but there exists a “hardcore”, for whom this an occult (i.e., Gnostic) wonderment.

                    Gnosticism is quite alive and thriving in the Western world.  So is Druidism, especially in the Isles and the U.S., hello Bohemian Grove.
America is a blatantly pagan nation littered with occult symbolism . . . the lingo of the elite.

                It’s funny Nick. The “Techno Class” stuff started firmly rooted in reality: Taylor time/motion studies, Ford’s assembly lines, Sloan’s organization methods, GNP accounting (Kuznets; yes, it gets misused but the intent was scientific), Six Sigma (recycled from Japanese Kaizen) etc. But at some point (maybe McNamara in Vietnam), it just became easier to make up the numbers and superimpose a political Narrative.

                    Affluence and abundance prepared the ground for living with delusion. The earlier innovations were at a time without a social safety net. Once the welfare state was in place and the peasants warm and fed and harmless, lying became the default since there would be no consequences for it. I think McNamara makes a good marker.

                        To sharpen the focus and identify the philosophical position at work in that disbelief, let’s call it materialism : the denial of the vertical, spiritual dimension and restriction to the horizontal, worldly one.

            Bush/Cheney most likely will be the last persons of that particular brand ever to occupy the White House. At the conclusion of Trump’s term it will have been twenty years since that cancer had a host.

                Crippling USAID will have a lot to do with that. I had no idea these people pushing neocon ideas into the system work being funded by the US government. Crazy me, I thought it was Jewish billionaires funding it. However, as a friend of mine says, billionaires are the biggest welfare queens in this country. So, it figures that they would find a way to advance their prerogatives on our dime.

The floodgates were intentionally opened on Black Monday, of 1987, by none other than (((Alan Greenspan)))himself, and Black Monday has haunted us through Sept 11th 2001, through the 2008 collapse, and on into the(((Bernanke/Yellen/Rubin/Summers/Mnuchin))) rape of the Treasury &amp; the Federal Reserve.
None of these (((billionaires))) earned their money the old-fashioned way.
All of them were the beneficiaries of massive illicit “leaks” from the Fed.

        I respectfully and fundamentally disagree with this essay. To conserve is to preserve or save something. What is being preserved or conserved? They, we hope, are smashing something – destroying it. Well, they better be smashing and destroying it. Of course, at the same time they must be building something and something better.Conservation has nothing to do with any of this. The most critical part of the project is the reconstitution of the entire reason for any of this – the people and their well being. The entire thing hinges on mass deportation and restoration, not conservation, of the American demographic dominance. Otherwise it won’t be America.We will know Trump is serious about this when he starts taxing remittances. He must ruthlessly starve the NGOs of money for population replacement/resettlement, then he must tax the remittances so heavily that these people go back home. The tariff threats are nice, but the beating heart of TGR is remittances. Mayorkas himself said so. They are transfer payments to Wall St.Terms are defined by actions. What we demanded for the past two decades is restoration and reclamation. This is defined by the actions of cessation of mass legal and illegal immigration, mass deportation through financial and if necessary physical removal and destruction of the networks and people who are carrying out mass replacement migration / population resettlement.Musk today revealed the latest scandals in FEMA paying for luxury hotels for illegal immigrants. The time is now. Tax the remittances, sue to the ground the hotel operators and try them for treason. Most aren’t American anyway. Then bring back the rope factories and crank them up full time. Put the names on them for a little, “personalization”, that the managers love so much. Then put them to use.We aren’t conserving anything other than our people. Even that is a restoration project. Conservatism has failed and I never want to hear the word again.

Dont get me wrong – I love what Trump, Elon and Big Balls are doing… (wish someone would do it here in Canada)… but, dammit…these guys gotta be PUNISHED. People have to see the system actually work.
It’s like a rattler in the back yard where the children play. You don’t put a bucket over the snake to isolate it and hopefully contain it… you kill the snake.

                    The law requires the state attorneys-general in the complaint they have filed to post a bond in the amount that the court estimates the respondents might have to pay OR be damaged if the court should find in favor of the respondents. The law specifies that the United States does not have to post such a bond, but the state attorneys-general DO. That alone should render their complaint moot, since the bond would have to be posted in cash b/c nobody would underwrite a bond in the action at hand b/c it could run to scores of millions or even billions of dollars. This has been reported for the past day or two elsewhere on the ‘net. Check Vox Day or Western Rifle Shooters Association.

I am pretty sure Judge Engelmayer would rule that the proper amount was zero. I am guessing that in fact he already has.

                    Lame Cherry, having read Sandburg’s history of Lincoln,   put forward the the idea of using a Provost Marshall to go after, try,and punish these traitors.The High Collar CriminalsPresident Donald Trump is the EXECUTIVE in the Government branch. He has absolute authority to appoint anyone, and in numbers of cases without Congressional “advise and consent” to carry out his orders.DOGE is an audit platform. The President in having Elon Musk his representative, because the President is the one who is security cleared, is Constitutionally authorized to engage in this audit, and Mr. Musk and his team should be commended for the fine work so far in rooting out over half a trillion dollars in waste in Congressional budgets that do not exist in programs….these judges are providing protection for an insurrection against the United States.The entire point in this is, that there is no protection for judges nor for representatives who have engaged and enabled criminal acts. The remedy is a Provost Marshal with an arrest warrant from the Attorney General, Secretary of Defense or any other official representing the President, should be served and these criminals be taken into custody for a Tribunal trial to settle their fate.

But if he doesn’t, there are over a hundred US district judges lined up to run his presidency for him. He should be able to see this now.History may have given us an opportunity, but the man who brought it about has a fatal flaw, which is his age and worldview. To do what is necessary would involve changing something deep about him as a showman and a businessman, and I don’t think he has the will to throw the old self away and embrace the chance he was given.

                    I reject that it even amounts to crossing the Rubicon. Even more than the prosecutions, clawing back the money is something that would be expected, but, yes, it is viewed now as revolutionary, which is telling.

                    Yesterday Trump said he would obey the judicial TROs that are attempting to stymie his efforts. If he is serious about that, it is probably the end of significant reform. It will almost certainly take two years, at least, for these issues to reach the Supreme Court in definitive fashion, and in any event he should not be confident in the votes of Roberts and Amy Two-Names (maybe not even Kavanaugh). In the meantime, the gears of leviathan will grind on.Prudence is all well and good, but wisdom is knowing when it’s time to go to the guns (metaphorically speaking, NSA!). In my opinion, it would be better to have the “constitutional crisis” now, when the political winds are at Trump’s back, rather than wait until a time when they may have shifted.

                        The justices he put on the court will never forgive him for making them “Trump judges.” They’llalwaysfind a way to screw him in retaliation—to show off for their friends, basically. “He thinks he’s people!”Every one of them has done it already, Gorsuch most egregiously. The other Republican knives in Trump’s back have been inserted while “in character,” but in the big troon case, Gorsuch took it upon himself to generate ashocking plot twist.Trump has to tell them to eat shit—preemptively, openly. Only a fully coprophagia-compliant ruling would be constitutional, obviously, but only Thomas and Alito care about that, so there’s no use making that kind point. “Pull one of your usual childish stunts and be disobeyed.Then what?”(This is not a possible event.)

                    Is it ever necessary to “jail” a judge?  Or is the key here to restore the original understanding of the judiciary as the organ of *opinion* and the executive as the organ of *enforcement*.  I do admit however, there needs to be some oversight in which to replace judges whose “expiration date” has been reached.  To this effect, lifetime appointments need to be eliminated in favor of term limits.  This should restore a balance and churn the judiciary in order to meet societal changes—but not the immediate passions of the “mob”.

                        One would think the Trump team would be very aware of the dozens of non-compliance precedents set by Biden.
That would also supply a simple, boilerplate answer for media pests.

                I will be interested in how your Orange Man deals with the lawfare and rogue activist-judges
It’s really quite simple. Step one is to trace out the implications of a rigged 2020 election. Since fraud vitiates whatever is dependent upon fraud, it follows immediately that Biden was a fake president, a mere imposter. Therefore Donald J. Trump is the 46th president of the USA, not the 47th as simpletons believe. It follows from this that every judge installed while the Biden cabal occupied the WH is illegitimate. And that’s not all.

                        Afaik, for four long years Congress did not transmit a single bill to any president, as required by I.7.2 of the Con. The same clause gives the president 10 days to return a bill to Congress unsigned or else it becomes law, except in case of the adjournment of a Congress. So far, there’s no Con law snare here.The present Congress, however, could argue that the prior two Congresses transmitted bills to the White House during the years 2021 through Jan 20 2025, and that upon DJT taking the oath of office, those bills can be considered transmitted as required by I.7.2. This argument, alas, presumes that JRB was a fake 46th, which means all of JRB’s other acts, including judicial appointments, were fraudulent. This Congress would have to be desperate to take this route.Lots of people have been looking over the election results, often without finding good reasons to trust the official results. I hope those deepest into the weeds get the money they need to restart an investigation into the matter. They can organize the data in the clearest possible way for presentation and publication.PDJT, however, already publicly doubts that the 2020 results were legit. Possibly a law suit could get him to affirm this bluntly and to issue one or more EO directing relevant agencies, departments, and bureaus to affirm publicly that PDJT is the 46th president, not the 47th.

Worcester could have been a great small to mid sized city.  Took a lot of work to prevent it.

            Excellent comment. Musk showing the corrupt, dark underbelly of the beast has been an amazing moment. He and Trump at best are preserving our people in the currently deracinated state. Our goal has to be restoration.

                Most importantly, Musk is showing the President that his old CivNat faith in the institutions of government is not only wrong, but dangerous. Confronting Trump with proof of the rotten corpse at the heart of his idealized America will shock him and push him to more radical solutions than he imagined were necessary. Destroying Trump’s illusions even beyond what they were when he was nearly killed last summer is vital to turning him into a revolutionary historic figure. Having Joe Dirt and a solid group of loyalist advisers amplifying that message and pushing Trump to action, not empty bluster will have results.

                    Trump has transitioned to a revolutionary figure even now. He’s overseeing the attempted destruction of the Administrative State whether he realizes it or not. And I have started to think he fully comprehends he is not reanimating a corpse that died a deserved death long ago. Whether he succeeds is another matter, but I have started to think he may. This was supposed to be a Thermidorian Reaction and has blown well past that mission. Let’s hope he gets the military fully under control ASAP because it is still in the grips of ideologues and thieves capable of a full-blown, no shit coup.Trump more or less is Lenin at this point even if he wanted to be Stalin.

Very astute observation. It seems—putting the cart before the horse here—the man who follows Trump will determine all that Trump may accomplish.

                        He has already started moving, if only symbolically, against the military. Hence, he has forbade the celebration of ethnic and racial “months” in the military. If nothing else, Trump’s heart is assuredly in the right place.

                            We need to start getting rid of the Generals at the top.  One by one won’t do it quick enough.  The one back door solution is to shrink the command structure from 40+ (4-star) to a dozen or so.  He could then handle the dozen left—if necessary—in his term.  There’s reason many—if not most—of the military coups start among the colonel level.

                    What DOGE needs is a simple website, at minimumlisting such info as:
Each Instance of suspected abuse
Agency responsible
Full description of abuse and consequences, if known
Individual(s) most responsible for abuse
Approximate $ amount of each line item of abuse
Narrative detailing actions the agency had taken toHide or obfuscate said abuse
Having such factual data at hand and current will go a long way toward validating his effort, and will further enrage the progressives.
I’m surprised such a chronicle hasn’t already been established.

            Hear, hear.  If I had a buck for every recent internet comment telling people to ‘legalize’ their status, or that ‘murka loves ‘legal’ immigrants, I could pay for a few months of groceries.  Trump doesn’t have to worry about gettingre-elected, but he’s yet to touch the immigration system overall.And we’ve heard almost nothing from Stephen Miller of late, whether about faux ‘refugees’ or the approximately 1.5 million ‘legal’ third-world immigrants per year.  Yes, money matters, but demographics matter more.  F**k the magic dirt and magic papers and gyrating magic negroes at the big sportsbowl – I want a White future.

            I’m afraid you don’t grasp what conservatism is. You seem to confuse it with Conservative, Inc. But they are only grifters, who have been schooled–not educated–beyond their innate intellectual capabilities. You can tell that when any one of them mentions “conservative ideology,” which is a true oxymoron, since ideology is as far from conservatism as the east is from the west. Conservatives are grounded in custom, tradition, law, religion, and Nature; that is all. Ideology is utterly foreign to conservatism.

        Virtually no one in human history, before the 20th century, believed any of the propositions put forth by the “progressives”…e.g.Egalitarianism is disproven every day everywhere, and ditto the notion that women can perform men’s tasks as well as men, and vice versa, etc…Lenin pushed them as a way of undermining established society, but cracked down on feminism when he attained power…The reality is that most politicians don’t have an ideology, they are just grifters, stealing vast amounts of government money for themselves and their followers..What’s being uncovered by DOGE is that the theft of government money is in the trillions, and may account for virtually all of the US debt of $36 trillion…The Pentagon alone is missing $23 trillion…

            Before I understood that all economics is equally fake and talking about it can only help the bad guys, I used to hypothesize that we’ve been in an unprecedented depression for at least half a century and the entire positive side of US GDP is (to simplify) “Democrats paying their voters,” counted repeatedly.I never expected normal people to find out what I was talking about. Itshouldbe important—a mind-altering revelation. But we have those every day! Then we forget what we’ve seen and resent anyone who points back at it. USAID, still intact, has been made Old News. Knowing its name—like saying “Alinsky” or “cultural Marxism” or “MKUltra” or whatever—is aloser shibboleth. Already!

        “The Covid vaccine is a great example of the recklessness of medicine. Even a little bit of prudence would have avoided this easily avoidable error.”You’re being way too charitable. This was deliberate criminal behavior, as is so much else in US big business. Likewise for the military-industrial complex, whose dynamic seems to shape foreign policy. But returning to pharma, drugs are often rushed to market based on flawed and rigged testing. Call it recklessness if you will but I say the bosses are aware that there may well be detrimental side effects (assuming the drug even does anything to mitigate the main condition to begin with) but are indifferent to those consequences.

            I disagree with the statement for a different reason. They couldn’t exercise prudence in rolling out the vax because the reason for doing it so quickly had nothing to do with vaccinating people. The purpose was to serve as an off-ramp for lockdowns and masking. They scared everyone so hard and so many independent agents became true believers in the ‘deadly pandemic’ narrative that it was all runaway positive feedback loops. Pretending like the vax was a miracle was the only way they could stop the narrative-driven monster they created.

            I agree. The vaxx is definitely something that should be attributed to malice. Worse, malice at many levels, including the lowest level – the doctors getting paid based on vaxxing volume. Selling their trusting patients for a few shekels.

                The salient point here, I believe, is that doctors have been shown to be human—not gods—and our heretofore faith in them misguided.  The majority of physicians, albeit licensed to prescribe and treat, were little better than the average patient to understand contagious disease.  This is why I’ve termed them technicians rather than “scientists”.  Too many decades of TV medical shows created their god-like persona.  Covid scamdemic destroyed such.  That’s why JFK jr is needed to restore/reaffirm balance.

            What made it implacable and inexorable is that it was not a public health response.What it was, was a military response on a deadman switch.That switch, that built-in set of responses, was a corollary to a nuclear deadman switch.Once tripped, a whole bunch of other pre-programmed switches started tripping in a perfectly inhumane bureaucratic procedure.What used to be a minor concern of government, “public health”, has now become a ‘matter of national security’: “biodefense”. Regardless of the origin, by animals or by enemy, the same preset responses were poised. Thanks to international security arrangements, those responses marched worldwide.In order to get around restrictions, DoD partnered with HHS, that each could do what the other couldn’t in America. In Europe, NATO was the central controller. Covid was the test of a fully meshed public-private system.https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2025/02/09/an-important-conversation-the-covid-dossier/Unstated in the video, this is why WHO was positioned to be the heart of a planetary military-corporate dictatorship, the ultimate design of the UN with its endless web of agreements and arrangements between nations.  Like a spider’s web, tug one strand, the whole thing starts vibrating.

                “Thanks to international security arrangements, those responses marched worldwide.”Not sure what  you mean by “worldwide,” but the things you describe did not happen in a single Southern state as far as I know. Not GA or SC or FL or AL or AR or TN to my certain knowledge. The governor of GA asked for “two weeks to flatten the curve” after which he said it was all over. The “news” media went berserk, but he ignored them and so did everybody else. The governor of SC just declared everybody in SC to be “essential” and appears on TV to apologize for any “inconvenience” that Carolinians might encounter. The governor of FL’s actions were well-chronicled in the “press” at the time. You should leave wherever you are and move to a state where the people are not treated as subjects by elected officials. I don’t think the Dakotas went crazy over the whole stupid hoax. Many states were free and functioning normally the whole time.

                I like Judge Nap. Unfortunately, this issue has touched an old nerve in him, which he should let die, which is the battle over the executive versus legislative branches in the US. I’m guessing this goes back to GW Bush and bad feelings from those years for both of them over the “unitary executive” theory pushed by Addington, Yoo, and others.That’s a nice debate to have during certain historical eras when the document over which you’re arguing is still regnant. As it no longer is, it’s a bit like watching old men argue over an instruction manual for a 1980s computer. Of academic and not practical interest.

            Nap is a pervert and a clown. What he presents as reason and analysis always is a pretext for getting some fresh boy meat in some convoluted manner. The scariest thing is to think he actually believes law and the U.S. Constitution are a thing at this point (he’s too smart to believe it, so see the first full sentence).

                Too harsh.  What you forget is that the judge rarely—if ever—is pontificating by himself.  His guests are, in their own light, quite informative and authoritative.  So they are all perverts and clowns?

            The “good judge” is *not* deluded.  He simply has an opinion of the events that differ.  One can watch his channel without much problem even on this side of the divide.  I advise one do.  My retort to the above criticism is that Trump knows exactly what he is doing.  EO’s are designed to push the process into the courts as quickly as possible.  Congress simply cannot, or will not, act in the timeframe needed to effect change.  Trump has been there once before, and was burned.

        In terms of a voting base, who the pundits call Trumpists or maga are basically the same people who supported Goldwater, and they haven’t changed since that time, aside from some dying and some being born. But still essentially the same group of people. Who were later called the Tea Party. And are now called MAGA. And along the way were deceived by some pols who claimed or pretended to be “conservative.” But remaining the same bloc. At its core, it is nothing new. What is new is successfully electing a president who actually makes what appears to be a sincere effort to rein in the blob.You could say that prudence has emerged as a larger bloc (once we include sympathetic mestizos and the likes of RFKJ and Tulsi) because imprudence has also in recent times. aka Clown World.

        The Oligarchs are already showing cracks in their coalition:https://www.theamericanconservative.com/musk-led-consortium-bids-on-openai/This is going to be wild. What is also interesting about this is the other lines that this division breaks down upon.One of those lines is a stake in the future. Altman, Robois, Karp, Harari … … are all pillow biting fudge packers. So is Thiel. Musk is a heterosexual advocate for eugenic natalism.Luckey is a typical Silicon Valley guy talking both sides of his mouth. This article is interesting and revealing. (https://www.tabletmag.com/feature/american-vulcan-palmer-luckey-anduril) He talks all about the essential well-being of one country that isn’t his and then says he is sacrifices his health and longevity for his company. He also never makes a case for how he is doing what he is doing is creating stability. I wish he would talk about using the technology for the operational security of our border. It is so odd that all of these guys in the America First coalition never really advocate for the best interest of Americans. I really want to admire Luckey and back him. But, he makes it impossible. This is just classic Silicon Valley California tech mindset.Interesting that his sister is married to Matt Gaetz.Andreesen? He is a bot. Not sure if he aligns anywhere or will just feed on whichever carcass comes out of the fray.There are other lines of division that I am sure people here are aware of. In any case, the war over who will control AI and defense technology and contracting is underway. Altman’s response is very interesting.In any case, the war in the clouds looks like it will become more transparent during the Trump administration.As for our interest, they either tax remittances and ramp up mass deportation or this is the final betrayal.

        One of the greatest things to happen by Trump entering politics was how it revealed so many figures on the faux-Right. Pretenders outing themselves across the board as merely playing their roles on the stage of Conservative Inc. For many, this was an epiphany moment realizing a lot of these folks were charlatans selling a version of Conservative Coca-Cola and didn’t want anything to actually get better or change.

                I disagree. He actually believed that he was politically viable as a Supreme Court nominee during Trump’s first term, and was pissed that he never made any of the lists. He didn’t expect to be named, but he wanted to be included in the pantheon for posterity.He certainlywouldbe a great SC judge, but your comment is about him being “too smart to believe” something, and I have good reason to believe that no, sometimes, Judge Nap is not as smart or in tune as he thinks. If he was smart and experienced in that world, he’d know (as Doug MacGregor knew last summer when asked by Judge Nap if he’d serve as SecDef and laughed at the idea he’d even beconsidered) that people like him do not get appointed to those positions, ever.

                    “Smart” may have been incorrect. Substitute “naive.” And to the extent it even matters at this point, we need radical justices rather than people who think the Constitution can be ghost danced back to reality, as if that even would be a good thing. Nap would have been a terrible justice on that score alone.

        Prudence, yes.‘the intense belief that they are commanded by history or history’s God to impose this ideology on the people of the world’They are holy apostles, caretakers, guardians of the Prog Precepts constituting their religion, typically since youth — Glory Years for the Booms and Xers that they thirst to re-live.  They lack the inner fortitude to change spiritually and politically as they mature physically.‘In fairness, it is even more difficult for the old school lefties, because for them, politics defines their life’Yep.  They replace God with their own wills, essentially.I knew these folks in the Eighties, while living and working in San Francisco.  They attend the rallies and marches, meet on Saturday mornings for Political Affinity Group, read the N.Y. Times, and seek to judge and convert others with verbal cueing in all environments.Always rebelling and subsuming the truth to ideo-political expedience, their spirit is luciferian, opposing the Christian ideal where Christ personifies Truth and followers seek likewise.‘And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.‘And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:‘That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.’  (2 Thess. 2: 10-12)What we’re witnessing in our nations is this strong delusion, that was imposed en masse only AFTER rejection of truth and righteous living.

                This brings to mind a sage insight from Z-man some time ago.  Something to the effect that all political struggle we discuss boils down to “getting rid of the crazies” among us.

They have retained your great faith in the primacy of willpower over the law and order of existence. Like you they are also egoists. Both you and the progs belong to a school of crude, barbarous primitivism. Your quarrel with them is about in whom the power resides, not about whether not egoism and willpowerism are wrong.their spirit is luciferian, opposing the Christian ideal where Christ personifies TruthJesus failed to satisfy important requirements expected of Israel’s maschiach. After the national narcissist was rejected by his betters, he lapsed into despair about what to do with his misguided, unproductive life. So he concocted a plan to commit suicide with help and set that plan into motion. These are a few of many truths which you must accept to be set free from your frustration and your rage.

        I would argue Leftism, since the second half of the 60s, didn’t become unhinged after the “necessities” of the Cold War fell into desuetude. It was always unhinged. However, with the defeat of global communism, conservatism–for what it was worth–lost itsraisond’etre. Conservatives wept because they had no worlds left to conquer. They felt they had no purpose. And rather than honestly appraise the postmodern Left, recognize it for the evil it was, and combat it just as vigorously as they did the commies, they surreptitiously joined hands with the Leftists and dug their greasy hamfists into the massive grift American FedGov became. Greed supplanted vanquishing communism in their morbid hearts. This was the birth of the uniparty Trump is attempting to shatter.

            Ostei – I said this before here and so I’ll say it again:  the West LOST the Cold War and the Left, Commies, Progressives, whatever you want to call them, won and captured the Anglosphere and W Europe and have been moving steadily eastward recapturing most of the former CW communist countries to where they are now on the doorstep of their former crown jewel, Russia.  I would argue (again) that the communists lost Russia, but won the most of the world, and it gnaws on them to no end that they lost Russia, which explains the vehement hatred of everything Russia that we now see in the so-called democratic West. And unfortunately I don’t see it stopping even with Trump. He is only a speed bump on their relentless road to Moscow and beyond (looking at you, China).

                Today’s Leftist elites are not Das Kapital-quoting Marxists. They are–although most of them don’t understand quite how–the intellectual descendants of Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, Barthes, etc.
What happened was that a notionally liberal empire–the USA–defeated a communist one–the USSR. Once this process was complete, the USA abandoned its notional liberalism and became an unhinged, postmodern Leftist polity. That is where we currently stand, although Trump is attempting to restore sanity and in the process chuck the pomo elites onto history’s slag-heap.

        One must wonder if career Republican seat warmers (that’s you, Susan Collins) ever had the thought “Is this good for the country and it the people?”, rather than “Is this good for me?”
One need not wonder about the Democrats.  For them it’s all about the money or the mad religious beliefs.
No one protesting Trump out of prudent concern for the future of the Republic;  All the protests are about money and his heresies against the degenerate public religion.

        The thing about modern philosophies, whether govermental or corporate, is that they all seem to be based on first order thinking only.This is purely Mercantilist thinking. The only thought is the quick hit, the immediate profit, like Mob gangsters robbing diamond stores in Vegas.No thought as to the future, the greater public, or the quality of life down the road.The immediate quick return, even if for only a short run, is all that matters.I blame bureaucratic corporatism, as limited liablility corporations can morph, and change, moving from one product to another, a Blob by any other name.What used to be were institutions that did one thing only, and had a culture of striving to to do it well. For instance, a few years ago the last bell-maker in Britain closed its doors after 350 years.All the arcane knowledge and traditions of casting bells, gone; what they did not do, was switch to making fancy coffees, hair care products, or sustainable and equitable foreign aid programs like African well pumps and Ukrainian artillery shells.

        In the 11th paragraph of this piece, Z compares desiring the “known”, instead of the “unknown”.
Hence prudence.
It reminds me of the scene in “Wall Street”, where Bud Fox asks Gordon Gecko why he has to break up his dads airline.
His reply; “Because it’s breakable!”

        European conservatism always meant “preservation.” America’s version is a meaningless checklist of things that do not even consider preservation to be necessarily a good thing; the term has become marketing for policies that are found on Column B of today’s menu; today’s Column A will be tomorrow’s Column B, to borrow from Dabney.In a sense, the non-ideological Trump may be America’s first conservative president save possibly Coolidge. So when we hiss “what is there left to conserve?” it is aimed more at him than to the shadow monkeys of Con, Inc., who seek not to preserve anything. This is seen particularly in attitudes toward demographics and trade. There are some older, proper English gentlemen who do a somewhat anodyne podcast, Traditional Britain Group. They routinely criticize how trade is undermining the UK’s economy and how The Great Replacement is destroying the fabric of their country. Of course, they are labeled “Far Right” or “Radical Conservative” and have been under MI5 surveillance for years, likely at the direction of the United States. These harmless and thoughtful but allegedly dangerous men espouse traditional European conservatism, and the GAE seeks to prevent that in its closest vassal state.I will go out on a limb here: Progressivism is dying, and Con, Inc., is dead even now and is a zombie. Today’s American conservatism, or prudentialism as you label it, is preserving wreckage for the most part, and maybe scaling it back around the margins, and that’s the best outcome available within the degraded and debased political system. It isn’t what we need but it is what we have for now.

                No tears still for the Sudentenland Germans.Palestinian is what one calls a person who was born and lives in the Palestine region, as that area used to be known.  It was named, but not a state, just like Ukraine was not a country until 1991.  (Or Nazareth was not a town, for that matter.)
‘Palestinians’ are a mixture of legacy population, related to the Jordanians across the river, and simply rebel Arabs under someone else’s rule (Ottoman, Hashemite, British, or Israeli.)

        To be charitable, let us take some credit. “…the radicalism at the heart of progressivism.”
Yessir, you bet, since the beginning: in the New Lands, we gave every idea a full and fair trial, because the good old ways had problems of their own.
You have to at least give us that. We couldn’t always foresee the results because we hadn’t tried a lot of this stuff before. White people were always the world’s explorers.
I blame us for nothing but boldness (well, and a bit of gullibility, like listening to…)

        I think this is an excellent summation of the new political order. “Cloud People vs Dirt People”, “Anywheres vs Somewheres”, “Liberals vs Anti-Liberals” doesn’t quite work…but yes, it is Prudentialism (and skepticism) vs. those who either don’t question orthodoxy or are trying to exploit it.

        Interesting that today’s Zman article speaks of prudence, while today’s Sailer article speaks of a list of wild fringe movements he associates with the right:
“One increasing possibility appears to be that newly self-confident right-wingers are getting into various kinds of New Age woo-woo, the occult, gnosticism, RFK Jr. junk science, paganism, Indian esotericism, Chinese numerology, health food fads, etc.”

                Sailer is the classic example of what you described in your article–a puppet of the Left who puts up Potemkin opposition to the Left in order to gull the rubes into believing they have representation in the Power Structure. If you’ve got a bit more gray matter than the average barnyard animal, you can see right through the shyster.

            When a man’s mind sits unused it becomes womanly, occupied with gossip and status—defensive and inoffensive. People say Sailer’s late weakness is because he’s finally been let in the club or paid off or whatever, but that wouldn’t explain much. I suspect he’s developed some age-related hormonal problem. Appearing to have sold out is a symptom—along with outbursts of senile rage. Remember, the most reliable way to elicit one, for years, was to claim (before media permission was granted) thatBidenis senile. He saw himself there.And yet— He’s been very prideful lately, especially that the fans who show up at his book events are younger than he’d have predicted. He doesn’t model the thoughts of his missing peers, which might be something like “We’re embarrassed” or “Looking at you is like watching ourselves die.” We have nothoughts.We’ve succumbed to low-class conspiratorial madness and he’s just too smart andin—young and vigorous!—for us to face without shame.It’s a hell of a thing.

        Return to prudence is Whitepilling and long overdue. How can each of us contribute to the momentum of this movement? It’s not enough to define the solution, there must also be implementation. And we should not rely solely on Trump and his team to pull the cart. Can there be a grassroots or crowdsourced tangible contribution? And if so, what?

        I’m reminded of that book about the Scots. Maybe the author is just a master storyteller, idk.I don’t think Enlightenment is bad, but add Calvinism to it, and you get Progress! Maybe Calvin has been our problem all along.  Z wrote about it not long ago.Who needs God if everything is predestined? If everything is predestined, why question or doubt— oneself above all? If God lets you down, who needs God? Aren’t you on your own, aren’t you forced to do God’s work?If modernity is, in some deep sense, the loss of religion, maybe we came to it via success, while the Jews came to it long before us, via failure.Prudence is a healthy expression of self-doubt.  We’ve failed, they’ve succeeded. Things come full circle?Just throwing it out there.

                Ok, I’m not either. Maybe I don’t understand it. But I do wonder about the relationship with God, whether He’s a hardliner or absent, and what that does to a person’s worldview. Either way, I imagine one feels compelled to do His work for Him. I can see that becoming playing God over time. And maybe more moderate types becoming deists.

        Alexander Vindman’s lies led to Trump’s first impeachment. He’s the epitome of how the neocons think now. He has a new book out in two weeks: “The Folly of Realism: How the West Deceived Itself About Russia and Betrayed UkraineHardcover.” Description: He “argues that America’s mistakes in Eastern Europe result from policymakers’ fixation on immediate, short-term problem-solving and misplaced hopes and fears. He proposes a new long-term, values-based approach that insists on the fundamentals of liberal democracy and a rules-based world order.”

        To make America great again, we must sweep away progressivism and its reckless implementations.No one can sweep away progressivism and imprudence without repudiating two of the most important founding principles of the USA. These two are egalitarianism (announced in the DoI) and popular government (amplified greatly in the authority clause of the Con). Such repudiation would amount to repudiating the USA’s past, fast developing greatness, too, which is fine. That greatness was experienced on a road leading to extinction for the people in whose names the USA was imposed by Freemasonish fools. Devotion to that road has also nearly gotten much of the world roasted in a nuclear war.Now, we can haveeitherthe USA and her strange road or a consistent, untainted prudence, but we canneverhave both. The situation is Either-Or, like the name of the second part ofAtlas Shrugged.

                Yes. Once you get past Trump’s bluster and bombast, you can see that prudence is a key component of his character.

                    Trump likes to “troll”.  Problem is that too many people take him at his word like he’s divinely powerful.  He’s just testing the waters and amusing himself.  It’s a bit less here, because most commenting have a high level of intelligence.  But boy, the Lefties out there…

        There was that song by the Beatles, “Dear Prudence” by, you guessed it, John Lennon, who also wrote “Imagine.” It’s all buttercups and unicorn farts. Throw Prudence out the window it’s so fuddy-duddy.

            There’s a real story to that song which if you knew you would understand  you have it exactly backwards. He’s singing to someone, “Prudence”, to come out into the real world.Oops.

                Um yes, that. It’s John Lennon, lol. You’re missing the meta content. But in the end, it’s just a song so whatever.
