        Joseph K nails it about the ‚Äútherapeutic managerial state‚Äù. That is about it. Shut down the factories, box up the machinery, ship it to China. The rust belt turns into the heroin and meth belt.No problem, growth industry; a rehab on every corner. Soma indeed!

        I would favor decriminalization of drugs over legalization. Letting the government into the dispensing, regulating, and taxing business is extremely corrupting to the character of government. Yes, it are already corrupted. That is why they can live with legalization.
Cigarettes, bad! Warning on package! Die a horrible death, do not smoke! Impose an evil tax to discourage evil smoking, raise hundreds of billions to save the children. Keep on smoking, save the children?

        ‚ÄúDrugs certainly play a role in the degeneracy of the lower classes, but they are not a cause.‚ÄùAbsolutely correct.  Drugs take hold in the lower classes because the soil is ripe.  But there is a flip side to the story.Contrary to what the IQists assert, most people are not born with a strong propensity for self-discipline and self-regulation, no matter what their IQ.  That is a Rousseauist fantasy.  Dumb people can be very disciplined, and smart people can be out of control.  Discipline must be learned, in fact implanted, and therefore must be part of the culture.  The mainstreaming of drug use, to the point where a majority of middle-class kids start using drugs at an early age with little adverse consequence, has meant the ghettoization of the middle-class.  The old bourgeois culture that made Republicanism and capitalism possible is nearly dead, and the mainstreaming of drug use has been a major factor.I would be all for drug legalization if the entire welfare state was dismantled beforehand.  In the old days, when drugs were legal, only the very poor or the very rich could be incessant drug users, because the one could afford it, and the other would die without consequence.  A middle class or working class person who did drugs would end up in the bowels of society, with no support or succor.  Punishment was swift and ruthless.  You ended up dead, or the living dead, which was worse.  The elites made drugs illegal when they amped up the welfare state for a reason.  They were smarter then.The war on drugs has not been a failure, because it has never been fought.  Where it has been fought it works.  What we have in the West is a game that produces revenue and justification for the therapeutic managerial state, and an excuse to put problematic members of the lower orders in jail.  The war on drugs is working just fine in Asian countries, which is why they are now stomping the West.  Kids in Singapore don‚Äôt smoke pot at 14.  Low level drug dealers are executed in China and their organs are harvested.  The Asians learned from the Opium Wars.  They made it extremely punitive for their citizens to do drugs, while taking over the supply side.  They are very happy to supply the West with the means to its own destruction.  I‚Äôll bet the Chinese Politburo is eagerly awaiting the day drugs are completely legalized in the U.S. and Europe.

        ‚ÄúDank Tanks‚ÄùThanks for that Z.I had no idea.
Another 50 years of drugs &amp; consequence free dysgenic breeding ought to finish us off.
I think Adams had it about right back then:‚ÄúOur Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.‚Äù‚Ä¶John Adams
I think Derbyshire has it about right, now:‚ÄúWe Are Doomed‚Äù:http://www.amazon.com/Are-Doomed-Reclaiming-Conservative-Pessimism/dp/0307409597/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1410445518&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=we+are+doomed

        The reason for libertarians to keep legalization activists the hell away from their movement should have been readily apparent, with the application of a little reason (ha ha, see what I did there?)‚Äìpotheads are going to be mighty easy to convince of the need for all sorts of government benefits.
Thanks for making a few million crude lunkheads with outstretched hands politically active, libertarians‚Äìthanks loads.

        Legalization will likely have profound long-term consequences. There are strong cases for legalization, and strong cases for the status quo. The status quo might be the best you can hope for in a modern democratic society.
I come down on the side of legalization, but like you, don‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs a panacea.
One alternative is to give away drugs free in the prisons. Kind of solves all the problems at once üôÇ

I have said for year that we should sedate the hyper-violent inmates. Keep them doped up and packed with calories so they get fat. If it is OK to dope up grammar school buys to keep them from acting up, it‚Äôs OK to dope up the lifers in the can.
