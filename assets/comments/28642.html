        I assume that somewhere in that long stream that RamZPaul and Z Man discuss their differences over the value of voting.  Does anyone have a timestamp?

        I took ZMan’s tip to listen to Hakeem Jeffries. It doesn’t matter if he is dumb. He is bent on revenge. He has the blood libel. He will assume the leadership of the Dems in the legislature and he is young. He will be around for a long time, and not enough of our people are mentally prepared to deal with this kind of ferile assault and battery.

        This is a disaster for Republicans.
The Democrats are running the table on the Senate races, and while they will probably take the house, the are only gaining a handful of seats.
Given the state of the country, this should have been so much different.
Demographics is really starting to have influence here.  Florida is the exception that proves the trend, because that is where all the old white people moved to during the pandemic.

            This assumes they wanted to win big. That is a mistake. The GOP knows its role. They are the outer party. As such, they are not designed to be the majority party.

                My impression is that RamZPaul appeals to civic nationalists who doubt their faith.  In general, his callers have a strong feeling that the current system can be saved if only we just chose our words carefully but that feeling conflicts with their suspicion that diversity dooms the current order regardless.
I tend to lose my patience with their hope that the current system can be saved but RamZPaul is quite good at guiding them towards a more realistic outlook.

        Traffic was terrible coming home from work. Got to the polling place, busier than I’ve ever seen it. Worker told me turnout was something crazy like pushing 60% by the afternoon! Saw some very young people voting. That’s unusual. I wonder what it portends, if anything. I think I should know what to make of it all, but I have no idea anymore. The simulation might be broken lol.

            The dental assistant today was an American born and raised mostly in Columbia.  We spoke for a while.  He was one of the most ‘American’ people I ever met.   He has guns.  “Don’t let them take your guns.”  And he said, “I hate people that come to America and want to change it.  They have more than a hundred other countries to choose from if they don’t like this one.”And he knew our History, and how brave Americans have always been.  But he doesn’t see that bravery he’s always heard and read about in the young adults now.   It makes him very sad.Makes me sad too.

                I won’t doubt the truth of your description of the dental assistant.  Where we differ is that I believe that this guy will almost certainly chose his racial group over your shared values when the two conflict.  Similar to how all the black conservatives voted for Obama.  Further, as our country becomes more hispanic, the more his ethnocentrism will increase.I saw this in coastal California.  The more hispanics there are, the stronger their tribal feelings grow.  They collective urge for their race to rule over the other races will override any values that you share with them.Could I be wrong?  Sure, but I doubt it.  Race &gt;  Shared values

                    “Race &gt; Shared values” with the exception of whites, the racial group that appears to have the lowest ethnocentrism.  For this reason, it’s hard for us to imagine the incredibly strong pull that racial tribalism exerts over non-whites.
And yes, outliers exist in the non-whites, but they are outliers.
