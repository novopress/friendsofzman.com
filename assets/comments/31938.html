        To some extent, the young right is not wrong about the go to college / professional man / get married two kids in a McMansion / divorce woman gets cash and prizes life. Not because there is something wrong with it.Because it has now become nearly impossible to reach. 90% of women are not “marriageable.” The debt load / investment / career payoff for college ratio is not a wise investment any longer as it was for boomers – gen X. The paying” jobs aren’t there anymore.The other part of the equation is the millennial / gen Z college age white men are vilified and abused by the college system.No intelligent person would go tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt to pay admission to a club where they’ve been told in no uncertain terms “they are not welcome.” My youngest son went to college for a semester, saw it for what is and said “fuck that!” He wasn’t wasting four years and the price of tuition to be hammered with left wing kooky politics, and man hating feminazi Karen’s.These kids are onto the game, they know it’s rigged against them, so they are going Galt.

            It is statistically proven that people with college degrees out earn those who don’t have one. For every plumber and welder making six figures, there are 100 people doing menial jobs the rest of their lives. College isn’t for everybody, and don’t go into a lot of debt to get a college degree, but if you have the ability to do that, you’re short changing yourself by not getting one. The other thing about college is that like much else in life, it’s more of an issue of discipline and being able to get the job done then it is about the work being intellectually challenging. Once you figure out a system for getting the work needed done, it’s pretty easy to get through it all.

                The debt to future payoff isn’t there anymore. HB1 hires, “white men need not apply” etc… And when we went to college there wasn’t any anti white man hate. College is now a leftist indoctrination mill only and a grift for the colleges coffers.Completely different world.

                While it’s true that statistically college graduates earn more than non-graduates, I’m not sure this is a case of correlation indicating causation. Getting a degree requires at least some degree of brains and motivation, so it could simply be that smart and motivated people tend to do alright for themselves. My anecdotal observation among my peer group has been that the smarter ones typically made similar salaries, regardless of academic credentials.

                    The confounding problem, of course, is that a very high percentage of jobs outside the trades require a college degree. Thus, unless you land a well-paying job in the trades, you have excluded yourself from a massive tranche of positions by not possessing a degree.
Now I take a backseat to no one in my abomination of academia, but until employers devise another winnowing device, academia pretty much has the workforce by the balls. And I suspect this is by design.

                        The problem with college is young people don’t usually have a clear picture in their minds about what kind of job they want to get. And even if they do, they have unrealistic expectations regarding the future prospects of their career path. Most of these degrees are terrible at preparing them for a career even if it is in STEM. So they go into massive debt without a clear path to get out of it.There are some ways to save money though. For one, if you’re lucky and live near suitable institutions, just keep living with the parents and commute there. That saves the cost of room and board. Plus there are often discounts for local and in-state students. Also, if you can find a community college that has an agreement with the university you wish to attend, go to that community college and pay the reduced tuition rates. The credits will transfer and nobody looking at your degree will ever see that you spend half your time at the community college.I do think it would be better for young men to not go to college straight out of high school. It would be better if they went straight into the working world and spent some time figuring out what they want to actually do. That way if they need to go to college they aren’t studying aimlessly, and if they can skip it, they don’t waste 4 – 5 years of their life to make a start.

                            College was never intended to be a jobs program for everyone.  Traditionally, only the top students attended school beyond high school.  In the US in 1930, this was 12%.  After WWII and the GI bill, it rose to 30%, which is absurd.  Half of the world’s greatest inventors and discoverers never went to college; they were curious men who had been educated by tutors and who had sufficient wealth to study and experiment with whatever they wished.At least 60% of ‘college’ today isremedial work and de facto 13th grade.  The entire concept of a ‘liberal arts’ degree was based on familiarity with western civilization – from Greece to the present.  Now it’s various ‘studies’ and ‘communications’ and other pseudo-vocational training.If colleges and universities were limited to their traditional purview and limited to the top 10% of White students who desired to learn the arts and sciences, then we could have various legitimate ‘technical’ and apprenticeship programs for other career paths.  There is a lot of space between a plumber’s apprentice and a legitimate PhD candidate.  The Germans and Brits do a better job of tracking and sorting students than we ever did, before the satanic lie of ‘equality’ pervaded everything.

                                3g4me:“At least 60% of ‘college’ today is remedial work and de facto 13th grade.”I can’t find anywhere else in Z’s kkk0mmentarium today to make the following point, but tagging along behind 3g4me seems as good a place as any, so here goes…My gut instinct is that when it comes to questions of educability &amp; employability in Klownworld Hellscape, personality is just about infinitely more important than is intelligence.Trying to get an active aggressive White man [say, a Tom Brady] to act like a passive aggressive White man [say, a Mitch McConnell] is like trying to get oil &amp; water to mix.It simply ain’t happening.Furthermore, the various Passive Aggressive personalities now completely dominate all of academia &amp; corporate boardrooms &amp; gubmint &amp; the like, to the extent that an highly intelligent masculine White boy’s biggest problem in life is that the Passive Aggressives will immediately sniff the smell of Active Aggression on him, and then they will move instantaneously, in perfect concert with one another, to destroy the White boy’s prospects in life.3g4me is fond of saying that Culture is way downstream from Genetics.But I would add that Personality is way upstream from Intelligence.

                                Don’t think 3g4me is correct? My university recently released the stat’s on incoming students—40% taking remedial courses Freshman year! When I applied to my first university, there were no “remedial” courses.  If you were not at admission level—indicated by HS coursework and SAT/ACT, you had to go elsewhere.  Community colleges were often recommended.  You could fulfill your “deficiencies” there and reapply, albeit HS’s in my day were pretty good compared to today.

                                    I started college at a Midwestern BSU in the fall of 1972. There were already remedial courses back then; mostly for athletes, Negroes, (big overlap with athletes) and feather Indians.

                                In addition to keeping returning servicemen out of the work force (4 years to flatten the curve😀), the GI Bill was intended to identify smart young people who might benefit from a college education, young men, mostly, who might not have otherwise have gone to college. Guys like my dad, who got his accounting degree 15 years after he graduated from HS. Of course we then jumped to the conclusion that everybody should go to college… as bad an idea as is out there.

                        Ostei, one observation—which I believe you implied, but others may miss.  The requirement for degree to have a good job is not intrinsic to the requirements of most jobs, even outside the trades..  Strictly employer preference. Brian Caplan has done much study on this, both from the employer viewpoint (employers most often have to extensively train new employees in performing the job) and the knowledge imbued/retained by the typical college graduate (little is remembered and therefore used).it’s really a shame that so much of society’s resources is spent for advanced education not necessary for successful life and career. As I said many times, college attendance is waay out of line with societal need.  At least half the students attending—and graduating—should not be in college.

                            The takeaway from that is that there is one employer who will hire you for your assets, regardless of your credentials.
And the fact that many talk about how worthless said credentials are, I’m guessing a lot of them would be similarly generous about not demanding a degree, but rather basing the decision on your skills.

                            No question about it. The current college-to-career system is farcically inefficient. However, academia is a central pillar of AINO’s power structure, and it functions quite well as an indoctrination device. Therefore, it’s highly unlikely anything will be done to reform the system. If anything, just like the franchise, it will further bloat and ramify.

The degree is so you are going to believe the regime morality. These employers could train you to do what they needed, but you must go through morality training.AND, before all this woke stuff I was convinced college was so that the good females could get a few men inside them so they went into a marriage having already been um, experienced. In order to make a divorce more likely.also, females are spending their most fruitful age not breeding, so they are less likely to keep the white pop even at replacement level

And I suspect this is by design.”Back in the Jurassic era, when Steven Sailer was still readable, he used to make the point that college degrees had become a stand-in for the old IQ tests [determining low IQ] which the Supreme Court banned in Griggs vs Duke Power.But then the situation became exponentially worse with Jordan vs New London, which allowed employers to affirmatively &amp; proactively discriminate against White job applicants on the basis of IQs which were too high.So, yes, in the wake of the destruction wreaked by Griggs &amp; Jordan,academia absolutely has the workforce by the balls.All by design, of course.None of this shiznat is occurring randomly.It’s all part of (((The Plan))).

                        I’ve long supposed that forcing workers to go through the same cattle chute and coming out in debt is the real point of the college system.Once you go through it you can’t well quit with the years of time commitment and debt hanging over your head and that’s how they like it. To get cut into the racket they have to have something on you first.

                            I can understand why you’d feel that way, but how does it square with the effort to forgive student debt? The Supremes scuttled it, but a great deal of student debt was forgiven anyway, and for many others, new repayment plans were instituted that dramatically reduced monthly payments.

                    This needs to be upvoted. A lot. There’s a heck of a difference between going pre-med or engineering and going grievance studies. And it’s been exacerbated by “everyone” going to college, with the result that in order for the unqualified to get the sheepskin, it gets dumbed down to the stupidest person in the class, not even rising to the level of a participation trophy, which assumes you actually tried to participate.

                If someone were to ask me, I would say that you should go to college if you have a plan – as in, what are you going to study and what job are you going to pursue and how are you going to get there. The days when you just needed a degree, any degree, to get a decent entry level job and move up through the ranks is long gone and died with the 2008 financial crisis. Colleges are more than happy to sell you this fiction and have attracted millions of people with it, but it doesn’t hold anymore.And yes, if you can get into Harvard, you should go to Harvard. I know it’s mostly a leftist propaganda mill, but it still generates the country’s elites, and the right wing abandonment of this and other elite-making institutions has been a total disaster.

Was that ever the case? Admittedly, by ’08, I was long since into self-employed, but even back in the day, I’ve never encountered an employer who didn’t care what my degree was in. Granted, it’s always been a technical field, but I’ve never seen just a “whatevs, dude” approach to hiring.

They absolutely drive 100% of the growth of the economy.
And they have radically different personalititties than do company men.

                    The point is still that Jews don’t push their kids into plumbing but a lot of people on the right are following this fad where that’s exactly what you’re doing. Then you turn around complaining that the Jews have hoovered up all the money and you’re stuck eating bugs and driving a car that shorts out in the rain.

I know lots of people well into 6 figures, maybe even into 7 figures running a couple dozen tradesman trucks.
Their earnings are not being hoovered up by Joos. Maybe that’s just a cope, but, still. you have to approach this as advice to the younger generation.

                            We’re talking about real wealth and having a seat at the table, not just a “job.” Sure, you can make money driving a truck if you want to be on the road all the time. A lot of people don’t make money driving a truck though. And then you have the toll it takes on your family life.

                            Steve, there’s a large Venn Diagram intersection between what you’re talking about here and what I had been talking about concerning “Personality being upstream from Intelligence”.The personalities of the kinds of young men who want to go straight from college to the corporate world are almost perfect inversions of thepersonalities of the kinds of young men who want to go straight from high school to starting their own small businesses.The first type of young men will tend to have Passive Aggressive personalities which will make them peacefully &amp; happily at home in the milieu of a large nameless faceless bureaucratic leviathan.Whereas the second type of young men will tend to have Active Aggressive personalities with little if any patience for bullshit &amp; backstabbing &amp; poisoning of the sociological well.What’s insanely difficult for young men is wearing something of a psychological inversion of Hervey M Cleckley’s “Masks of Sanity”, particularly when very masculine &amp; highly intelligent young men have to pretend to be soft effete wishy-washy pu$$ies, in a desperate attempt get some productive use out of their alma mater’s sheepskins.

                This study is over 30 years old and a degree back then may even just have been a predictor of IQ, not a catalyst for success.  I think the bell curve book showed IQ was almost just as much a correlate to financial success as having a 4 year degree, and this was the early 90s.

                    Again, we’re talking about having a seat at the table and having a voice to mold society into the image you want. The Jews push their kid to get educated. You guys are pushing them to be plumbers. The Jews come from European peasantry. You’re telling me a bunch of people of European peasant stock have these super high IQs? Their fückery aside, they push their kids to study and take school seriously. White people push their kid to be the high school quarterbacks and cheerleaders. That’s a huge reason we’re falling behind, not because the Jews are some master race.

You are not saying that corporations must hire X% of each race, like the commies and nogs do, are you? Why not just prove your worth? Or better yet, start your own business? I get that as you drift closer to 25 employees, you will be forced to justify why everyone is white, but you have at least a dozen before you have to concern yourself, right?

                                        And the blacks and Hispanics are being hired in place of Whites by Jewish orders and you can dance around that all you like, but those are the facts.
No White who isn’t groveling to Jews is going to get a fair shake.

                    I believe you are probably right. @Davidcito. Intelligence correlates well with entrepreneurial success, and high IQ types tend to not be sympathetic to jumping through hoops, and are often smarter than their professors.

                This comment is increasingly dated. Most employers are no longer impressed with bits of paper from college. Even for “hard” subjects like the physical science and medicine, they want to know more about you than what a certificate says. My daughter is doing a music degree in the UK. It’s now 4 years and so much of it is Woke crap and pointless projects, that she hasn’t been able to practice actually playing music. In other words, doing a music degree is actually HINDERING her musical career. College is not worth it.

            P.S. I understand your sentiment and I’m not knocking it, but the fact remains that the stereotypical Jewish mother is pushing her kid to become a doctor or a lawyer, not a welder. There’s nothing wrong with being a welder, but we need people representing us, with a seat at the table where they are deciding whether we bugs and whether they take our cars away from us or not. Plumbers don’t get to decide that. The people who did well in college and post graduate work are the ones who decide that for us. We need to make sure we keep our representation and continue to have a voice in those decision-making circles. Master plumbers don’t have that voice.

                You are exactly right. Perhaps the key reason the New Left conquered America and turned it into AINO is because they took command of the nodes of information dissemination–education, media, culture, and most recently, corporations. And it’s this Leftist monopoly on opinion-shaping that allowed them to propagandize white people into oblivion. Being a plumber is great. But if you want to influence people, being a professor is much better.

My DIL. We tried to discourage him. We ended up paying off her 6-figure student debt and high 5-figure credit card debt so it wouldn’t cripple their marriage, to give it the best possible chance of working. She is Christian, so there is that. But evangelical, so I don’t know.

All it means is his annual gift and eventual inheritance were reduced, or more to the point, paid up front. My daughter will probably rub it in to him in private, as her share didn’t take that hit, and that’s how she rolls… 😉

                            Probably not. She has kicked so many “alpha” types to the curb. She’s not likely to settle. She wants to be a stay-at-home mom, but only if she finds someone more ambitious than she is.
She’s already contemplated the possibility of just adopting white kids, and raising them in a multi-generational household, her mom’s folks, us, her and her brother’s family.
Maybe there’s some white guys out there that deserve her, but so far…

            To avoid your kids getting into college debt…I suggest saving money so that they don’t have to take on debt to pay for their college.
For me at least, I see it as my duty to pay for their education, unfortunately including private school to keep them out of the public cesspool.

What better to spend my earnings on though, really?  If basics are covered then it seems next on the priority list.

        I wonder if the current derangement syndrome has now reached the point where zoomers expect life to be one long blockbuster action/romance flick. Well it never was, for anyone. Youngsters probably forget that before general Patton was “general Patton the swashbuckling tank commander” he spent A LOT of time doing all the boring army stuff that’s 95% of military life. Lewis and Clark spent a lot of time doing all sorts of boring chores, David Livingstone studied medicine and wore out several bibles before he trampled across interior Africa and Neil Armstrong also did a lot of mundane things before he went to the moon. And if people want a more adventurous life than those guys, well, maybe that’s just not how this biosphere works.I think the basic problem here is detachment from reality. For every adventure, there’s a mountain of “boring” chores to get there

            True, but there is still plenty of adventure out there to be had. Nothing stopping any of these guys from signing up as a medical orderly on the Ukrainian front lines, for instance. Bonus: they could meet some real Nahtzees who are actually walking the walk!

            Exactly. Extremely online like-gatherers do not understand the amount of boredom that even “the most interesting man in the world” has. Imagine Hannibal just bouncing along on his horse on long marches. Imagine James Cook sitting on a rock waiting for his ship to be repaired. Imagine Trump picking his nose while he watches TV.

            The human brain cannot distinguish between what we see on a screen and what we see in real life. This has far-reaching effects and it is why mass media is such a useful tool for political and social control, and so dangerous when nefarious people control it (as has been the situation for the past century).I think that millennials and zoomers, though, seem uniquely unable to make the distinction, probably because they have lived in a world of screens that was unimaginable for anyone who was born before 1980. It’s not just that they would subconsciously believe that what is on a screen is or represents reality (for example if you ask someone to picture life on the American frontier in 1870, they will almost certainly picture a western movie as first thing). But they think that the people on the screen are actual, flesh-and-blood people with thinking, motives, deserving of human rights, etc. It’s a very strange phenomenon but you see it a lot especially when TV shows hit the zeitgeist, like Game of Thrones a few years ago.So it’s not so much that, say, Russell Crowe is playing a character in Master and Commander, but that his character is an actual person, and this is representative of the actual life of an actual person.

                    No, this is just the way our brains work. It happens on a subconscious, chemical level. It takes conscious effort to distinguish and sort out the two. I pointed out the example of the western to show how this can work in our brains, but it goes much deeper than that and has many more implications.

                I suspect you may be right. And if so this must lead to mass insanity. The American psychiatric Association changed the definition of psychosis maybe two decades ago. The old one was something along the lines of “inability to distinguish delusions from reality”. I think the old definition is the more valid and that it was changed because the problem was becoming too widespread into politics and other areas that were not the traditional form of psychotic episodes but highly debilitating nonetheless

Nowadays, the yuge advantage “youngsters” wield is the knowledge that Patton &amp; Forrestal &amp; McCarthy were eliminated after the Council of the Sanhedrin voted to approve their assassinations.
Heck, for that matter, youngsters nowadays know about 1000 times moar about 9-11 than any of us knew as recently as 2008 or 2012.

        “the people we call the right have always embraced the sterility of material existence. The point of life is to get a good job, work yourself to death to buy stuff and then die before you become a financial burden on the next generation…”——————————————————————————Conservatism was sold to me all those years ago – as common sense, a philosophy for building a better state, higher standard of living and ensuring prosperity today for me, and the kids that would come after me tomorrow. I was also told the way toward to all that was working and sacrificing today to reap better times tomorrow. I went all in and spent the next 40 years living frugally, saving, sacrificing and living for tomorrow and living like that young fella in the vid.25 years later, 3 generations of increasingly erratic garbage liberal women flipped their lids in unison and pulled their families down. I found myself sitting on a pile of money I’d saved for my daughter – enough for a nice starter car, a down payment on a home and funds for education. When she ran away to join the circus because having fun was more important than working… I was stumped. I kept working and saving and gave my kid 5 years to grow up and maybe straighten out but it was no use, we were permanently estranged. I just took the money and retired early.Now I am a good-for-nothing kidult too. I am a gun club duffer, failed gardener, and stubfart vagrant that gets around in summer on a motorcycle. For the life of me… I can’t tell if I am personally better off or not without a family, job or obligations – (assuming the current cultural and political climate). The workplace is a soul crushing lunatic asylum, traditional family life and ties are in shreds, the future I tried to build for myself and a small legacy to leave behind for the kids… all that is impossible now. My heart bleeds for those frail, doddering WW2 vets wondering why in hell they ever hit the beaches on D-Day only to see all that effort turned into… whatever “this” is.How ARE we supposed to react to that vid? I am asking because I don’tt know… All I DO know is that the conservative punditry – from the fags like Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro – right on down to street level retards like Yours Truly – are not going to have any answers for you. Your life strategy has to be yours and work for you under rapidly changing and deteriorating circumstances and you will have very little, if any control over things when the pooh hits the fan.As the sole occupant of the right wing outhouse – I wish y’all the best of luck.

I’ve got no answers. I’m glad Fuentes and Woods have gained a level of independence but there is no way I would advise anyone to do that without a lot of FU money. Maybe I’m wrong.

        The reaction to the video (which was oddly made to make it seem as though the guy had no human interaction) is potentially related to the continued crashing birth rate.(Big caveat: Birth rates have been falling since the 19th century in the West, but there’s no doubt that we’re witnessing a drop to unseen levels.)Something is very wrong in the developed world. Men are withdrawing but becoming more conservative, while women are becoming even more feminist. A huge portion of young men and women reject the lifestyle – the sacrifices and the joys – that come with having children. To some degree, it seems that they don’t want to grow up.Beside some Peter Pan complex, there’s also the fact that society doesn’t reward getting married and having a family. We all know that complaints that men have – divorce rape, etc. But women aren’t praised for having kids or helping the community. Society tells women to be independent and that relying on a man is shameful.The irony, of course, is that 99% of the young men and women choosing to not have families and maybe even avoiding the other sex aren’t living lives of adventure. Sure, they go out a touch more, but even that tails off in their 40s.Something is very wrong out there – and people can feel it.

            “women are becoming even more feminist”
American women simply aren’t that sexy or attractive, and I’m not only referring to their physical appearance. They need to slim down, laser off all their tats and stop acting so bïtchy and entitled. Foreign women, including European women, do a much better job expressing their femininity which is far more attractive to a male than a woman who acts like a man is. So is it any wonder that men don’t want to mate with these kinds of women?

                Agreed. As a father with a daughter, I can tell you that young men notice very quickly any young woman who acts like, you know, a woman. In fact, at my daughter’s university, the greek system is growing because it’s traditional. The women wear dresses and do women stuff. The men notice.It’s interesting because while in surveys, women are supposedly becoming more feminist, on the ground, I can see a rejection of it by a lot of women.Nature also wins. People who reject family will eventually die out. People who embrace family will pass on their genes. The past 60 years have been a revolutionary time, but that revolution will fail because it rejects nature.

                    Right! Seen the same with my kids.Problem is it’s largely the wrong kind of boys who are noticing. By which I don’t mean the crooks, but just the nihilistic ones who are already “bored” with life and who have exactly no life skills under their belts.Boys need to man up. So your old man didn’t take the time to teach you things. Think that’s unique to your age group? Most of them didn’t teach you anything because they didn’t learn anything useful either. It’s never been easier to learn woodworking or smithing or the maybe more practical electrical or plumbing or wrenching skills that make you worth having around.

                The tats are mind boggling. It’s as if sometime in the last 5 years, for no reason at all, everybody decided to go get inked up. Even old people. Fat people. Every kind of people. Whenever I go out it’s a like a carnie circus. That capitol policeman with the neck tat was the clear marker of a new era.

                    I was at Menards yesterday buying some DIY stuff. I had the misfortune of being in the line of a new cashier they were training. I’m thinking to myself, she’s not bad looking, in a little bit of a frumpy mid-40s sort of way, that is. I’m waiting in line and have nothing to do, I started noticing the tats on her fingers. Then I looked down and you can see the tats on the bottom parts of her legs. Who brainwashed all these people to think that any of this is attractive to males?

                        When at the grocery store, I will use an undisfigured cashier, even if it means waiting in line longer. I don’t want to look at those people, and I don’t want to interact with them.

                            As I notice these disfigured individuals more and more in daily activities, I can’t help noticing how they have written their “fate” on their bodies for all to see. Rarely (I can’t think of an example) have I ever noticed one in an upscale “profession”.Once when my son was but a youth, he came home after school with an earring. He was all smiles with his mom until I came home from work. As I walked into the kitchen where both were—mom looking disconcerted, he with a s**t-eating grin—I passed by him approaching my wife and snatched the earring from his ear and proceeded to toss it in the trash.Mom was shocked at the attack and ear damage. I said nothing and left the area. Never was another word said and son to this day has no voluntary bodily disfigurements of these sorts, albeit a lot of scars from sports activities over the years.That was perhaps the one incident I can remember that was so instinctive/visceral and reactive on my part. It seems to have made a great impression and is one of son’s favorite stories at family gathering—guy’s like 40 now, geez.

                                Well done, Compsci.  Neither of my sons got a piercing, but the older did get some tats – after he was 18, out of the house, and we had no say.  He at least stopped before anything more noticeable than his upper arms.  A friend’s son just continued with dozens of inkings.
As for the women – I agree it’s distasteful regardless of age.  And being women, they generally get stupid and cringy and emotive tats.  And don’t get me started on nasal piercings – no White tradition of such that I’m aware of and unsanitary to boot.

                                    I’m pretty tolerant of hidden tats, for sure. IMO, the fact both of my kids got small, matching tats reflecting their Nordic heritage means I probably screwed something up, somewhere along the line. A prominent tat, yeah, I’m pretty sure I’d take that as a complete f-up on my part.

                                That’s exactly why I downplay the effect of genetics. Clearly, whatever made him choose as he did was not hereditary, from you, at least. From what I understand of the research, at least half, maybe as much of 3/4 of behavior comes from peers, not from either parental nature or nurture.
Which kind of goes along with what we see with the nice girls going off to college and coming home for Christmas break complete nutcases.

                    This impulse to self-disfigurement, particularly among women–and the piercings are even worse than the tatts–is one campaign in the war on civilization.
One hallmark of civilization is a reverence for beauty. But because beauty, like broader civilization, is inegalitarian, it must be eliminated. And many individuals across the West are doing their part in that campaign by making themselves, and thus the West, fractionally uglier. They are, in essence, symbolizing their sympathy with the crude and hideous savages streaming into Western lands. Down with beauty. Down with civilization. It’s all of a piece.

                            They are ashamed of their superiority. And that shame, ironically, proves they really weren’t superior to begin with. They’re simply traitors to their own people and civilization, and there’s not much that is more contemptible than that.

                I’m at a point where I tend to think of most American women as second-rate men with tits.
A few weeks ago, a departing Mexican co-worker brought his young (25ish) wife to his going away happy hour.
She was so feminine in contrast to the typical American woman it was somewhat bizarre. Of course, another co-worker thought it was hilarious to teach her English swears, which I was not very impressed with.

                    A few daughters here and a foreign wife (to be clear – we met at work, but she had not been in the country long). One of the things I love about my wife is her dislike of tattoos and trashy women. I feel this is important for our girls to see and hear. I love how my wife is feminine and doesn’t curse or lie, she takes care of herself, still looks very attractive – and she puts up with my crap. Not saying there are not American girls like that (my daughters, I hope are), but the filth the average American girl is exposed to is horrifying.

            This was quite deliberate.  Even playing Every Breath You Take too slow, to make it sound more creepy and lonesome and the not-so-subtle point of having cameras on you at all times.But frankly, I think there are far worse fates in the world of work.  I spend long hours behind not one, but two computers.  This is infinitely  preferable than probably what 1/2 of more people do for work.This guy has a wife and a kid on the way.  He is better positioned than many.Social media has done a lot to change peoples’ expectations.  All the people posting pictures and short videos of their perfect and glam life.  That it’s all BS or vastly out of context is lost on a lot of people.

            Yeah, the video had a caricature type vibe – no interaction with his wife or co-workers, no playing with the dog, no having a couple of brews with his buds etc.  It did look ridiculously sterile, but hardly real life, imo.

            A huge portion of young men and women reject the lifestyle – the sacrifices and the joys – that come with having children. To some degree, it seems that they don’t want to grow up.
If you were to actually look around you objectively, you would notice that (1) there are plenty of child-free people who are well and truly “grown up” and (2) the moronic and irresponsible often dispense babies on an industrial scale.
Your own preference does not entitle you to insult anyone with a different lifestyle.

        One of the things that has lead us here is the lack of any sort of defined future for young people these days. White American society has collapsed, there are no families, no neighborhoods, no Churches to join. The social capital has all been monetized, and I think we are just starting to see the effects play out as people who have been raised in that environment become adults. Rebuilding all of that will take generations of work.

Problem is if you bring a nihilist or defeatist attitude into a tight-knit community, you won’t  be accepted anyway. And your kids will pick up on that attitude, becoming a self-licking ice cream cone.

        “they want nothing to do with the mundane life that makes the physical world possible”One can observe just from watching the video that there is probably very little this guy does that makes the physical world possible. He could disappear and the physical world would go on just fine, as we found out during the plandemic. Probably the majority of office jobs are make work jobs. Even many of the ones that people work hard at, or think they do. Finding new ways to move loldollars around, or new ways for people to waste time online, is not necessarily productive work. Assuming that the job pictured even rises to that level of “productivity,” which it may not. Many don’t. Which leads us to larger questions about whether money is a means or an end. Of course most people would say the former, but their behavior says the latter.It is family and children that gives this corporate automaton existence its meaning. Lacking that motivation, this “job” becomes 100% the soulless hell that is pictured. Why would any sane single childless person want it? Can any such person be blamed for drinking heavily or doing drugs after spending all day every day sitting at that desk?Of course nowadays many more folks are single and childless, so their motivation to live such a life would be even less. But also many of them are not sane. So maybe that balances out. Perhaps the single childless woman was made for that job. Since she’s insane enough to think it is important.

            You’re certainly right that the vast majority of jobs in AINO are functionary cursor-pushing. They are insignificant, inessential and meaningless. The greater bulk of people who claim to have “careers” are flattering themselves. They have jobs whose purpose is to keep a roof over the head, food on the table, and the electricity on. Nothing more, nothing less. That being the case, if you aren’t deriving meaning in life from extra-occupational pursuits and interests, your existence is probably pretty pointless. But perhaps it has always been thus.

        I’m of two minds on this matter. On the one hand, there is certainly much to be said in favor of financial security and material comfort, if not opulence. For much of my earlier life I lived paycheck-to-paycheck and even snagging a few tacos from Taco Bell was a considerable financial outlay. It wasn’t all that pleasant. More recently, however, my finances have improved considerably and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that it’s nice not to have to worry about money anymore.On the other hand, however, to live almost exclusively to acquire baubles of status–the house in the prestigious neighborhood, the new Benz (invariably silver), and a Patek Philippe–is risible because it is shallow. A rich life, which does not incidentally require great riches, is one reflected by manifold intellectual and cultural pursuits, not the least of which is immersion in the history, traditions and customs of one’s own people. I would also add living a life of aesthetic refinement as being essential to the rich life.Ultimately, material comfort should be the handmaiden the deeper existence. Once we secure our material base, then we can get on with leading the truly rich life, untrammelled by fear of debt, bankruptcy and indigence.

        Something’s missing. The fact that the people with romantic ideas about life also live mundane lives like everybody else doesn’t invalidate them. There is no enchantment, no magic; just the everyday dullness of doing the same thing over and over again, buying the same crap as everybody else and then dying.TBH, I am actually surprised that this kind of widespread ennui has not lead to heroic mass movements, like in the 1930’s. Either the system is working really well or people are just incredibly beaten down.

                    You and your kids can do sports, martial arts, outdoor stuff like hiking and rock climbing, every week. Most families just don’t prioritize more adventurous pursuits, and would rather sit in front of the TV or spend their money on a trip to Disneyland.

                        My point was that (especially in North America), people are allowed to take 2 weeks off per year and even that’s often risky. The remaining weeks of the year are the same routine of going to your job, doing what you are told and then coming back home tired and sad.
Full disclosure: I have mostly escaped the rat race, but I see this on all my childhood friends, who are always stressed out and tired.

                            You’re right – unlike in Europe where jobs start with 1 month paid vacation per year – but in America the key is to maximize weekends. You have to be a “weekend warrior”.

                                I have no idea how that could be downvoted.I doubt there is a place in North America that is more than 2 hours from hiking, canoeing, backpacking, camping, etc. What’s that, $30 in gas, tops? Another $20 to rent a canoe or camping spot. There are not all that many places on the continent that’s more than 20 minutes from a park big enough to toss a frisbee with your kids. You could even get together with the neighbors to rent a bounce house (less than $100, depending on where you live), set up some backyard games and grill some dogs and burgers, at least those who don’t have a stick up their butts about grilling or getting together with the neighbors.You could be a weekend warrior. You just choose not to.

                                    Hello, agree. At the age of our young male Juila — my wife and I lived within an hour of a large city and also lived on a lake.Did not need to wait for the weekend. Typical spring/summer/fall night, take my canoe out and toss lures for Large Mouth Bass, hit Perch, small mouth. Smoke back than, a nice cig, six pack, had a regular local buddy into fishing.Back home for dinner, my wife an excellent cook. Always had something going in the garage, project cars, restoring a dresser. Did my own repairs on vehicles, house. Cut the lawn.Ahem, attend Mass on Sunday, check the divorce stats for same faith, practicing. The divorce rape phenomenon is for the godless. Under 5% for two practicing.Always a book going, ‘what are you reading’ a regular conversation starter.So if these heathens, status seekers, worthless degree debtors want to commute to their useless cubicle jobs… then film it for water cooler talkers … so what.Make life have purpose or don’t. Right now dealing with Normies, lazy, texting while driving… across the board are like the old ‘white man’s burden’ but now is OUR burden, regardless of color.

                                        What’s also interesting is that companies like 3M deliberately chose to site their plants in relatively small towns an hour or so outside of cities. Camarillo, Wahpeton, Weatherford, Greenville, Tonawanda, Hutchinson, Brookings, etc. (If you know what those plants produced, you can probably guess my background.)

            Most modern people have completely accepted the materialistic frame, even those who should be inclined not to accept it, like Christians. Once you buy the notion that all there is to life is accumulating a storage unit of junk and then dying, life does indeed seem as sterile as most of the universe is.

            The current system does a great job of taking care of the vast majority of people’s material needs. That would seem to be a very good thing, and I suppose it is. However, this phenomenon has turned people into dozy hounds, lolling listlessly beneath a shade-tree, awaiting the master to bring out a bowl of kibble and fresh water. It’s certainly a living, but I’m not sure it’s much more than that.

        Methinks that many people innately understand that prolonged affluence had made most of us soft and lacking in ancestral robustness. They also sense that a serious change in that easy standard of living may soon be upon us. A voice in the back of their head is speaking to them and saying . . . “get your ass in gear now or you may not make it to the other side.” That’s the genesis of the malaise, but it extends much further. A spiritual emptiness comes along with it (I am not worthy), and there is a need to prove yourself as more than just a cog in the machine.We’ve been down this road before as a species. The ancient Greeks had their stoics. A life well lived meant walking the hard road and overcoming every obstacle in your path. It’s still true today, it’s just that most of the obstacles have been bulldozed by civilization. So you have to make your own. At some point every day, your muscles should hurt from exertion and your mind should have been challenged by a problem to solve. And you should find a way to inspire a small child.And when the fog arrives, you must rise to the challenge and do what must be done.

            Not to mention the average age of first birth going up for both men and women. The fact that almost all infants survive both birth and once born, into adulthood. From what I’ve read, well into the 20th century most families lost a kid or 2 either during birth or in the first few years of life.

        One of the best pieces of advice I was given as a young feller was that you take and or keep a job for four reasons, and all four are of equal value. Money they’ll pay you. Amount of time they demand. What you learn on the job (is the job interesting and will it lead to other jobs). Whom do you work with/for (do you have to work with assholes). If, for example, you have to work with assholes, they better be paying you more money.I have three Gen Z children, and all three, and their friends I’ve met, are trying to go rural. They don’t like people, and are actively trying to escape. Rural highspeed internet might yet be the death of cities.

            Thomas McLeod:  Without highspeed internet here in the woods, we would never have been able to escape the ‘burbs.  Yes, my husband is still tied to the phone too much of the time, but no more commute, no more diversity, no more office politics.  If, for some unknown reason this job were to vanish or were his employers to demand he return to the office, I don’t know exactly what we’d do – but no way would we go back to the city.

        While this video makes the job look soulless, at least it isn’t physically demanding and repetitive on top of being soulless.  There are many worse fates.  Instead of being a nice air conditioned and heated office building he could be working in a factory doing the same thing over and over for 8-10 hours a day.  Imagine being the guy who takes the sheet metal off the pile, puts it in the press and then presses the button and doing it for 40 plus hours a week.

I’ve posted before that there’s a video of the BMW factory in South Carolina where a lot of the stamping, welding, and painting is automated to a level where human beings don’t touch anything. Robots pick up and place parts in welding jigs and spot weld everything together. And I’ve seen automotive stamping plants where the sheet metal is automatically loaded into the presses without a human to touch it.

                I once helped put a roof on a factory in south Georgia in August (they had factories in south Georgia back then). I’d do it again if I needed to. It felt like fulfilling work. But I think there was one time I about fainted from the heat. Out on my feet for a few minutes.

        “He labors in a tedious job inside a sterile office in order to pay for things that are as sterile as the life he lives in order to obtain those things.”Sigh.  The “Right” view of this man is certainly more realistic—and historically accurate—than the Left.  Prior to the Industrial Revolution, that pretty much described the overwhelming bulk of humanity.  You got up and worked to achieve your “daily bread” over and over again until you died.  If you needed “meaning” above such mundane activity, you had religion, a belief in God, and a retirement plan based in the “hereafter”.  If things became less than boring and routine, it almost always meant war, famine, or disease—or all three.  Boring and routine was a blessing.So of course, we today follow the same general routine with certain substitutions.  But the basis of our lives is still to be self sustaining, to survive, and to produce the next generation of the species.  It’s in our damn DNA!The Left however are different.  Why?  I go with Woodley’s theory of “Spiteful Mutants” due to a breakdown of Darwinian selection after the Industrial Revolution.  The Left searches for meaning in a “Godless world” of their own making—a fruitless pursuit which leads to most all of the silly activities we associate with them.  If this silliness was contained among themselves, it might be ignored, but of course it isn’t.  And there lies the rub.

            Laboring for one’s daily bread had a different aesthetic when it was working your own land for your own food under the great big blue sky. Not to suggest that was all sunshine and rainbows, but it wasn’t office/factory drudgery either. Perhaps the protestant work ethic is rooted in that more meaningful kind of work, and not in the automaton kind, which seems unlikely to inspire any kind of ethic other than escapism.

                Most of history, you didn’t work your own land. You just got to keep whatever excess over what the lord of the manor decreed as his share of the produce. Which isn’t that different than today.
There was a fairly small time in US history where we operated under the various Homestead Acts. Most people never “proved up”, that is, even if given the land, they couldn’t provide for them and theirs for 5 years.

                    Sure but the protestant work ethic wasn’t around for most of history either. First there had to be some protestants. And then there had to be some people with a stake in their own work. I don’t think it arose out of serfdom.

                        Fair enough, but the Reformation preceded the Enlightenment by a fair degree. And it does not really account for European peoples who did not embrace Protestantism, yet thrived.
Now, granted, Protestant cultures do better (at least materialistically speaking) than most non-Protestant cultures (exceptions both sides, generally culturally-related, IMO) but it is hard to argue that Protestant Nordics think themselves happier, and tend to be high on the economic well-being scale, too.
Almost like it has something to do with melanin…

        There is more difference between Woods and Fuentes than just the latter’s crudeness. Still, someone who is intelligent and thoughtful and another who is an entertainer and carnival barker have arrived at the same place and same conclusions. They are the same age and live in basically identical societies.There is no small chance Woods’ grandparents if not his parents lived in poverty with dependence on the state. Fuentes’ family likely was the same along with possibly picking beans and dodging immigration officials. In two generations, maybe one, the children achieved unparalleled prosperity and became unhappy.Two contradictory things are true here–the annoying Boomer admonition to “get a job” and “pull yourself up” actually has a basis in reality, and the male Zoomer rap on the banality and hollowness of the Boomers’ workaday and smug lives is at least as equally true. This will resolve with the return of scarcity and possibly with war, and do so quickly. Lessons will be learned about how ephemeral abundance is, and an affirmation will come that surviving and living are indistinguishable. Studied unhappiness and smugness both are luxuries that flow from prosperity, which allows both to be indulged. Whether they are symptoms or causes, the society that allows them is on thin ice now.

            “the annoying Boomer admonition to “get a job” and “pull yourself up” actually has a basis in reality”Half of them are still in office and institutional jobs they should’ve handed over to the next generation a decade or more ago, preparing for a generational transition. Never happened and we are already seeing the skills and experiential gap everywhere.As for actually-productive jobs, they sent them overseas. Boomers had jobs handed to them by a White America that had gone from a farming republic in 1900 to a sprawling military empire 50 years later with so much work and so much money it was like a 2-minute shopping spree from 1950 onward. But if the US had never entered WW2, Boomers would have spent their lives just as their great-grandparents had. And been better for it, too.This smug generation that wants kids to make them burgers and sandwiches while they toss a buck on the table and tell them to “get a job” — this is the mental attitude of someone who cares nothing for anything other than their own material and financial comfort. Because of it, this country has no future.

On the plus side, I get the impression you are white, too, so you maybe should get busy picking out a comfortable chair so you can really enjoy all those sweet, sweet benefits of whiteness.

                I will say this, not looking to get into a mode of ‘defending the boomers’ but in my experience, the prior generation does not get some of the blame laid at the doorstep of the Baby Boomers.It was my parents’ generation that went into turbo divorce mode, whereas half or more of the families in my neighborhood, admittedly of a certain oft-named group, divorced. I have heard of plenty of those same divorce contracts being defaulted on, when the father promised to ‘pay for college’ but ended up making junior get loans.Yes, that generation did not lower their children into the pit of $ix figure debt —- but they were the ones that normalized ‘everyone’s kids get loans’ then that just ballooned to what we see now, families steering their children into hopeless debt.Goobermint voting to protect their selves and their banker buddies by making said debt non dischargeable in typical bankruptcy.The youngest boomer was what, 19 when Hart-Celler, sold the country down the river? Not exactly in the halls of power.It IS convenient to focus on one group, and I agree, the boomer experience is selfish, nation and family wrecking …. but I don’t hear too many of the prior generation piping up and accepting blame.

Because I didn’t do it. I didn’t leave my kids taking out loans for college. I didn’t get divorced. I wasn’t even born when my Senator who voted for Hart-Cellar was elected.
Same thing today. I’m almost certain you aren’t the one ushering illegals over the border, or cutting dicks off, or giving confused girls hormone treatments to send them into ‘roid rage.
Why the F*** am I responsible for the black on black crime in the cities?

If this is the kind of “logic” you have been teaching, good Lord, no wonder a college degree is so worthless.
And, frankly, it pisses me off that I’m being taxed to support this kind of idiocy.

                                You’re mad that your taxes are being used to fund something you don’t like.

No. Why not? Couldn’t you do something about it?I voted for every right-wing candidate on the ballot for decades, starting with Phil Crane. At every turn, Republican Boomers, who controlled the GOP, stopped all attempts to take over the party. Instead, they appealed to you, with the “muh taxes” nonsense, which you’re still repeating like a mantra. But it’s just air, like most of the past 60 years, all smoke, puff, gone, just like the country I see in 8mm films from the 50s and 60s that is now gone.Boomers in their last moments will see a Latino homosexual nursing aide throwing away a Q-tip in the hospital and say, “my taxes paid for that” as they slip into the abyss with the last word they will ever hear ringing in their ear: “Que?”

                The merit is the wisdom, admittedly based on many of the false premises* that you point out, not to surrender. It is solid advice.
*Shipping jobs overseas actually started with “offshoring” (a term I despise) automotive and electronics jobs to Japan in the late Sixties/early Seventies, and arguably with expanding oil production to the Middle East in the Twenties.

            Conditional agreement. For anyone entering adulthood with at least something on the ball, “get a job” is soul-crushing, awful advice. At least finish it with “..until you can be your own boss.”Sad thing is that there never really have been that many people with something on the ball at that age. Might be even fewer today, with “Safety First!” pushed on them from infancy.Several people knock the “boring” parts of life, but they are the kick in the butt you need to get you to do something with your life. If you recognize the boring aspects, you are capable of fixing it. If you don’t see the boredom, then you are primed to be able to be happy with it. Self-selection works great, so long as the bored are sufficiently ambitious.

        The reason the video comes off as creepy is because it reminds everyone of the opening of American Psycho where Patrick Bateman goes about his daily routine of soulless skin care, exercise, and pretending to work in an office, also with no expression on his face.
The getting out of work at 4-5 part was what gave me flashbacks, the day is almost entirely blown by that point.

        This dynamic is playing out on both sides of the political spectrum, as a common genre on TikTok is people (women especially) in shock and horror at the life they are expected to live for the next forty years. Of course, unlike men, they have an out, but the thought control matrix they have lived under their whole life tells them that is not an acceptable way to live (that is, marry young and start a family with your husband in charge of the house). Remember that this is a generation that grew up in the world of influencers and social media. Even the “working life” social media they consumed is nothing like actual working life, and most notably shows no work at all. I am not generation bashing here, as my own cohort of people has its own problems and contributed to many we are struggling with, but they have a total disconnect from reality fostered by a life on the internet.I think Nick Fuentes is a special talent in his ability to communicate, his ability to distill things down to a clear narrative, and to articulate a clear vision – all things that the conservatards have failed to do for 50 years. Yet his seeming contempt for normie life is going to be a problem as he tries to expand his appeal past his Groyper base. The fact is that he often tells his audience to work hard, study, be successful, and live a good, clean, Christian life, yet he does not understand that this video is basically what such a life looks like.

            Well, the fundamental problem with TikTok and other social media is thateveryone’spage is an intentionally curated highlight reel of their best moments.
Thus, sitting around comparing everyone’s page to your workaday life is going to make you feel unsatisfied by comparison.
The best response is to get off social media and work on improving your own life and trying to do some interesting things. It seems like a lot of people have yet to figure this out.

        Perhaps the reaction to the video from the Woods/Fuentes crowd is an unconscious understanding that for the past 60 years in the US white men have done this, and it has achieved nothing.
The right questions about the video aren’t being asked. It’s not about individual “happiness” (which until proven otherwise we must assume this man will define hedonically, not eudaimonistically) and a life of material ease and comfort.
It’s about what a society of men like this accomplishes, and the answer is nothing. Evidence? All around you.

        Back in my college days, the cool kids would have written off the guy in the video as “bourgeois”. The attitude of adolescent smartasses toward adults living normal lives 60 years ago was the same as it is now. There are Fuentes types in every generation. They just look different each cycle.

        Life isn’t 24/7 excitement and I wouldn’t want to have a life like that anyhow. When I was in the C-130 business, one of our pilots was grousing about the boring, repetitious classes we would do where we covered procedures, etc.I told him we do this so these procedures on the checklists become muscle memory, because if you’re in a crisis situation with your adrenaline peaking and your brain at half its normal cognitive capacity, you can’t rely on your wits.Fast forward a year or so later. I’m in Iraq on our deployment. We’re lifting off out of Baghdad International and I hear the warning tone of the missile warning system. Apparently, some haji with a MANPADS decided to target our aircraft. The system automatically deploys flares and the loadmaster says one of the missiles went for the flares, but the other one struck our left outer engine, known as No. 1, with a loud WHAP! The whole airframe shuddered.The co-pilot pulled the required checklists and we executed every part of them without issues. We circled around on three engines and landed with little drama.You can’t have the exciting stuff without the routine. If we would’ve blown off our knowledge sessions in the classroom and simulator, things would’ve turned out much differently. Like with the Puerto Rico Air National Guard in 2018, when an old C-130 being flown to the Boneyard crashed because the crew didn’t follow any of the checklists and nine died as a result.

        I’m in line with these guys, although I’m a little older than Spencer. They want meaning IN THIS LIFE, like the old left wanted meaning. The romantics of the 19th century wanted the same thing. This is what Nietzsche was writing about in his polemical way.Mediocrity says you manage this life for the sake of the next. Not too high or low, eyes on the prize, taken on faith. It seems to take more will and self-denial than most people can muster— even the mediocre.The gods don’t like this. Here’s some stuff, a book to read, a screen to watch, an experience— more management. Keep your demons and your animal nature under control. Chop your dick off and wear a dress, emasculate yourself, we’re going to get there! Here’s a vaccine, the good shepherds want you to stay healthy.Going out on a limb, but maybe the contradiction of modernity lies in its farsightedness. We’ve ended up bankrupting the future to keep the present at bay. It ends up looking shortsighted. Shooting from the hip here.Anyway, it’s breaking down, slowly but surely. And that’s OK. Our MO is collapse and reformation. We started in the collapse of Rome, survived the collapse of Christendom, and we’ll survive the collapse of modernity.

        this guy’s comment sums it up“Stable, no bullshit dude. Will make a single mom of two very happy one of these days.”The video’s protagonist gives off beta vibes, meaning wife will divorce him and he’ll pay welfare while she fucks a lowlife, that’s why he gets ridiculed by some of thecommentators.Reaction is based on man’s perception of what woman wants from a man:Young girls prefer flashy guys with swag over betas, that’s why younger generation ridicules someone like him.Middle aged women go for normie guys with stable income, thus older generation of men sees nothing wrong with him.

        Keith Woods is playing a very important role in getting The West at least on life support. It isn’t clear what he does in the physical world and it doesn’t matter to me. His part is played on line and he has been very effective in giving smelling salts to the only people who in the end are going to help us get from life support to a fighting chance to get back in the ring – Elon Musk and other oligarchs with the money and power to quickly and effectively organize.The other side of this are the Active Clubs which are a very positive development even if those guys tend to be lost culturally. I don’t see how you can be pro-white when your entire cultural front is a replica of black American thug ghetto culture. (break dance grafitti; rap; hoodies … …).The person who seems to have the best talk that looks like it has some walk is Thomas Rousseau. His idea of building a new American patriot is beautiful and well stated. There are many roles that need to be played and what is important is that they are filled and played highly competently.The acceleration that we need is acceleration of our formation as highly organized and highly aligned even as we play along multiple fronts. In the end, leaders are taken out because a movement isn’t a movement if it has no leaders who can legitimately hold power and vie to increase it. The people who deserve are ire are Blake Masters, J.D. Vance, Josh Hawley etecetera.Instead of roundly condemning this anti-white regime and explicitly standing up for us with a show of will condemning our dispossession and the genocidal project aimed at us, they condemn anti-semitism. Condemn, “anti-semitism”, fine. But it boggles my mind that that should be a bargaining lever and it isn’t used. ‘You want Israel advocacy and you want campus crackdowns … … okay. Here is what we demand.’ You don’t get into that position until you have become the explicit white advocate that we need. The first person with power and position, who stands up and explicitly advocates for White men and our families has hillsides full of angry hornets ready to swarm and defend our nests and the territories that serve them.Until then, we get marble mouthed apologists like Rufo and Carl saying anti-white but making no demands and whose disposition says, “Keep dragging me behind the portables and thrashing me.” Until we get some leaders whose disposition is, “This is our playground and we have the will and the numbers”, we’ll have to build disparate groups and movements. Let’s not attack those who are doing things that may signal to potential leaders that they have an army of lions ready to roar behind their back when they stand up say the few simple things that we are waiting and ready for them to say.We grow weary of the circus and the clowns who dawdle away precious time. Yet, in the meantime people of all inclinations do prepare for the next stages of our political battle for hearth and home.

        I follows some economic advisors and some of them like Micheal Green speak about a nineteen-twenties nihilism among the young people as they are high in student debt, property prices are so high they never will own their own home, many live with their parents. I think the post-2008 with low interests rates and QE have inflated many assets and also marginalized a generation in front of it.

        Entering my mid-50s, I have this same quiet conversation with myself almost every day.  I’ve done a reasonably good job in the past decade of setting myself up (and more importantly, wife and daughter) in a comfortable position for the future.  We’re not wealthy, but then neither are we spendthrifts.  We have rental properties, a good middle class income, send our daughter to a private parochial school, and travel as we see fit.  However, we don’t do much of anything that would be considered romantic.  I’m very content to get home in the afternoon and work in the yard or do repairs inside the house; and in the evening a good book is all I need.  My wife enjoys her flowers and plants, or experimenting with sour dough recipes.It’s been several years now since I’ve worried about having the kind of existence that gets “likes” on social media (not that I have social media).  I’d much rather be content than happy, if that makes sense.  Maybe it’s easier for me since I spent my 20s and early thirties bouncing around the Far East and going to school in D.C.  I’ve exhausted my desires for adventure.But if I had to give some advice to younger folks, it would be to lay a good foundation for your life, give yourself some breathing space. For countless centuries your ancestors craved a life of stability, of security from the elements, and now you have that chance.  Why would you force yourself to create drama and thrills where none are necessary?

                Jeffrey Zoar:  Very much agree.  I was the restless kid who always wanted to do things I wasn’t permitted to do or lacked the funding for.   So instead of dancing lessons, or travel and adventure, I read about it and fumed.  Once I was out of the house, I had all the intellectual stimulation and activities and travel I wanted, and eventually sufficient funding to enjoy it. But I was blessed with many opportunities and did my share of traveling the world and meeting interesting people.I question whether I would have been as happy as I was to be a wife and mother (even though I knew I always wanted that) had I not had those youthful days.  I also question whether I would have weathered the tough (emotional and financial) times had I not had the time and space to do some growing up.Now, I’m more than okay with staying home with my husband, watching the hummingbirds and the trees green up with Spring.  Being trapped on a floating hotel with a bunch of old people would be my idea of hell – but so, too, would be a modern bar or nightclub.What we think is our heart’s desire does change as we age, and as independent and antisocial as I may be at times, lasting happiness comes from human connections.  Having sufficient lucre to take care of basic needs and some wants is not to be scoffed at, though, either – people are ignorant of history and far too spoiled.

                    I think it probably does take a bit to settle down. Back in the days of arranged marriages, it was plausible to think that people who wanted the best for you (and for your family) would choose wisely.
I’ve seen boy crazy and experienced girl crazy (and the reverse for Mrs. Steve) so it hardly surprises me that in a day when very few even ask dad for his daughter’s hand (even when it wouldn’t matter anyway), that it might take a bit for the brain to speak louder than the gonads.

            Isn’t that what your 40s and beyond arefor? When I was in my 20s I despised the stale suburban life and there were countless movies and musicians that denounced it too. I traveled and drank and dated. Then you meet that special girl and have children, and within a few years you are focused on raising the kid in a good &amp; safe environment, not sewing your rapidly aging oats. When and if Nick, Keith, &amp; Co. find a lady, they will understand.I have the whitest of white-collar jobs and yes it’s not exactly hunting moose in the Arctic, but it provides a good like for the wife &amp; kid and I’m financially able to help others if needed. At 47, the highlight of my week is a walk in a park and seeing wildlife and the occasional alligator. Maybe finding a good meal for less than 8 bucks. Traveling every now and then. Not bad.

            Only speaking for myself, but the young fellers are not completely wrong. I see the trick as not defining yourself by your job.  There are many who do, and I can see where the kids look at that and wonder what’s the point? If defining yourself by your job is what floats your boat, then good for you.  For me, the job is a means to an end, not an end in itself.
As others have mentioned, the “end” is something you have to define for yourself.  It will be different for different groups.

        …they want nothing to do with the mundane life that makes the physical world possible. They may not know what they want, but they do not want what is on offer.Given what is really on offer for young White men in the modern world, it’s reasonable to cut the them some slack. What you see from Torba on Gab about the “parallel economy” is somewhat similar, albeit a more healthy approach.Young men want authenticity and meaning in life. That means being a part of something bigger than yourself. Secondary would be procreating and raising offspring. As has been previously discussed, these things have been largely taken from them.A big reason the series Shogun is so popular is because it features a wise leader in Yoshii Toranaga and a clan full of warriors who believe so strongly they represent what it means to be authenticity Japanese they begin sacrificing themselves for it. In the face compromise and death, they are the only people in the story truly living. Mel Gibson’s Braveheart touched on this theme as well.Even so, Zman’s critique is fair. Hard to storm the gates of your enemies, mush less build a community worth being a part of when you don’t know how to load the guns or build scaffolding. What we need is men who possess both. Radicalism tempered with wisdom and practical knowledge. Such men are most fearsome of all.

        A lot of the reaction is the original poster of the video took pains to make it look as lonely as possible. Note his wife never showed up, nor his co-workers, and it gave the impression of a man completely devoid of community.More likely, this guy’s life also consists of water cooler chats, talking to the wife at home about their first child, and going out once a week with his buddies. In that context, it looks far less soul-destroying.It’s odd the very online right-wing people don’t do anything adventurous younger people with a flexible schedule and no kids can do, such as going backpacking, visiting exotic locales, and driving around visiting friends who live far away. Heck, I know people with large families who live a more adventurous life than most of those guys. While even that starts to get stale and most men start to yearn to build roots somewhere, the younger generation lives their life like they have three children at home and a rigid job schedule when their reality is just the opposite.

            There is not a lot of risk taking with the young, which is the opposite one would expect in a world made infinitely safer over the last half century. That said, there is a huge divide on this along race and class lines. Young blacks still do what you would expect. Working class whites still get in trouble. The safety squad exists in the suburbs among middle class whites.

                There’s a young guy in my family who just got back from adventures in central Africa that would make “alt-right heroes” like Keith Woods and Richard Spencer blanch with fear. Another young girl in my family has been travelling and adventuring around the Americas for the best part of the last two years. Adventure is still out there – as always – and young people these days have a choice. It’s just easier and safer for most to revert to video games and online existence.

                        Paying her own way. Young people used to do that in order to travel. Some still do. It wasn’t unusual when I was her age. And it’s still possible, and shouldn’t be seen as unusual.

                “Be safe,” we are told constantly.
Avoidance of risk-taking in a society obsessed with safety is to be expected, perhaps particularly among the young.

                    Yes. If it’s not “Be safe!” it’s “Take care!” Back in the old days we mocked danger by saying, “Break a leg!” We are suffocating under the protective blanket of femininity.

                Yeah, traveling requires some sort of income.  Who is paying for that girl to spend two years galivanting around the Americas?  If you are going to college, you can’t do it before college unless you are willing to give up most financial aid.  Go after college when you have those college loans?  Skipping college altogether is the only option to traveling.  And again, who is paying for it?
The young aren’t adventurous because the system works against it except for the trust-fund class.

                    She’s paying for it herself, volunteering on farms and in hostels and finding cash-in-hand jobs on location. I did the same back in the 1990s. Pre-internet there was a famous book called “Work Your Way Around the World”: post-internet there are a lot more options.
Young people don’t need money: they need imagination and the simple gumption to get off their butts.

                            Get a McJob and save for the plane fare plus a bit of cash, plan ahead and off you go.What happened to the White man’s adventurous spirit? Well, it’s still here. You can stay in America and join the “dirt-bagger” culture which produced people like Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell. You don’t necessarily have to go to the other side of the world to have amazing experiences. But what I’m seeing is more and more young people glued to their phones, pot, porn and video games…just unimaginative and afraid. Yet here in the West we are still enormously privileged and have so much at our fingertips. These young people are just in a mental prison and their parents are not providing them with the appropriate guidance. Nor are they reading about heroes of yore like Kit Carson, F.R. Burnham, T.E. Lawrence, Hernan Cortez… their role models are vacuous celebs and youtube influencers!

                No, you can find work on the spot in many if not most places. Especially volunteer work. When I was younger going on kibbutz or moshav was a big thing, and using that as a springboard to see other Middle Eastern countries. Young people I knew would find volunteer/cash jobs in places like Egypt and Turkey, just to see the country.

                Yes and no.There’s never enough money to have a family, there’s never enough money and time to travel.Both get exponentially harder as you get older, even if you have $$.Think that job that pays you $300k/yr plus bonus is going to let you disappear for two months during the summer?  Think your wife and kids are going to live out of a backpack and sleep with strangers and share a bathroom in European hostels?I think kids are afraid to do the Europe thing when they’re young because their whole lives through college have been subsidized and carefully protected by adult figures.  (Colleges are especially terrible sort-of-adult Disneylands.) They’d have to actually take some very modest risks and have some socially awkward moments.Cheap tickets from NYC to Amsterdam are only $200 bucks.  Do your “Joe Job” for two months in the summertime then head on over.Because you’ll never have an opportunity like that again.

                    There’s always enough money to have a family. What there’s not enough of is a willingness to accept whatever lifestyle your own choices (mostly) require for you to to have a family in the style you desire.
I know people who are raising large families working as hired hands on ranches, and many of them were making less than minimum wage when they started having families.

        Its sour grapes to me. Bloomberg did a study, since George Floyd the Fortune 500 have in their new hires, had only 6% be White, and how many of those were blue haired lesbians? [100%]. The military is openly hostile to straight White men, as is corporate life, Academia, the professions, Hollywood, and the Last Frontier, Silicon Valley, is now 100% Chinese or Indian nationals. No White men need apply.These guys will never own their own home. They will NEVER be secure in whatever jobs they have, which will not pay much and will be at-will. They will never even have a steady girlfriend much less get married and have kids. So what happens with them? They are a force, which is why Andrew Tate got crushed, same with Russell Brand, and OMB for that matter. The Regime is certainly afraid of whoever can muster the following of people with nothing much to lose. And won’t follow the obvious path — top up those guys so they HAVE all the above, courtesy of the Regime, “don’t forget to support us.”For whatever reason, the Regime will not provide patronage to ordinary Straight White men.

            It’s easy to be so down, but, ultimately, prices are what someone will pay. Thus they will have their own homes, as soon as now if their folks care enough about them to build a “guest home” on the grounds. Which is not absurdly expensive. Since we owned the land, we tipped up one for around $50k.

            Oh, incidentally, if you find yourself in the position of building your own house, if you are on acreage, for Pete’s sake, consider future expansion. We kind of screwed ourselves with where we put wet walls and bedrooms, so there isn’t much option to put on wings, apart from maybe off our great room, which kind of bites, since if there’s a party going on late, that wing would have to deal with the noise.

        Ok, just to get it out there, I’m old. Not about to keel over old (I hope) but old enough to be called a “Boomer”. It used to be when you were young you went about “sewing your wild oats”. You either went to college (to actually learn a profession), got a job or went into the military. I took the military route. I set foot in 15 different countries, almost died twice, met both the most brave and cowardly men I have ever encountered and learned a trade that has provided me and my family a good living. All before the age of 23. Seems to me that if you really try and live large when you are young, you’re more than ready to settle down with a great wife and start replenishing the gene pool. Maybe it’s the lack of satisfaction with their own lives that makes the “Zoomer’s” (I hope I got that right) feel that life is missing something. I would feel unhappy with the “mundane” life of the “average guy” if all I had to show for my first 25 years of life was achieving a certain level in a video game, drinking too much and occasionally slamming some ugly pickup.

        i changed dentist’s during Covid cause I heard this new dentist didn’t require masks which I won’t wear. He introduced himself with small talk and then got down to business of my teeth.inwas thinking, I don’t want my dentist to be like me. I don’t want him with his head full of politics and (counter) revolution. I want him to be really boring abs steady. The world needs normies.now, since most people have rejected a religious society you won’t get your feast days and festivals, so it will be a little duller in a right wing society.

        I’ve never understood the appeal of Fuentes. One look at him activates my skeevey/avoid button. I never had a job like the guy in the video; I graduated High School and went to work with hardhats for 40 years in an oil refinery.  It was great; working life with people who understood what normal was.  Someone in the comments mentioned bourgeois.  Oddly enough, that was the tag my HS friends gave me for taking good blue collar money and avoiding college. I told them all to go piss up a rope.If people like that (in those bygone days) and like Fuentes now are staying out of the gene pool, good for humanity.

        We begin to hate what we cannot have.When you realize, as Fuentes-Woods have, that you will never have an advanced degree and a stable middle class life of your parents, gradually you come to hate.Also, to defend your ego, you begin to idealized what you are currently doing.After all, Fuentes-Woods are the vanguard of the nationalist revolution. Ipso facto, what they do is good.Ultimately, taking a deep breath and then selling out to go to college and eventually settle down with a degree holding professional woman (these are the only skinny women not on drugs left) would require too much work for too little reward for e-celebs.

        Interesting video.  During dinner the other day I made a comment basically, “I’m just a guy in a building doing a thing.”  My point was only that I’m realistic about my place in the world.My 18 year old replied, “That’s very existentialist.”  Smart kid.The video strikes me that way.  He’s just a guy doing a thing.  No shrines to himself plastering the walls of his cube.  Crappy quecas for lunch.  Takes some time to stay fit, plays with the dog.Other than the fact that my wife and I have dinner every night together, pretty much my day.  It’s remarkable for it’s unremarkableness.i don’t “twitter” since I don’t suffer from ADHD.  But I suspect the Everyone Gets a Ribbon generation can’t come to grips with the fact that most of us don’t really matter all that much in the grand scheme of things.  And that’s perfectly okay.Stuff like this comes up every few years.

        I think the two camps saw the video with different polarizers and they were talking past each other. I am in the “shit this guy is lame camp”. Day in the life videos are supposed to highlight something interesting about your day like social events or even practical aspects of your job that may be routine but have some meaning. I remember being fascinated as a kid by a documentary about a guy that did maintenance on the Golden Gate bridge, those were the days. This guy’s life looks empty. I know the video is fake, but I’m having a hot take inside the video’s POV.The reason the video is not appealing is that it is part of the masculine spirit to seek adventure and if you have to work for a living at least try to make it a little bit interesting. Tim Dillon has this bit about working in a call center and everyone needing to get high to tolerate the job. Many manual jobs in the USA have very high turnover. But even white collar jobs can end in an Office Space situation and nobody wants that. And middle management can end in a The Office reenactment.Matt Walsh (and many others like him) are in a crusade to bring men back to the longhouse and the Office Space. I wonder if Walsh had ever had a real job, we know DW host is not a real gig with deadlines and politics (for advanced jobs) or soul killing routine with low IQ co workers. Nick Fuentes has this bit about trying to work two weeks for UPS and being frustrated as the only smart white guy around low IQ people that don’t even care about handling the packages carefully and on top being reprimanded for a small thing in an environment where a lot of the others did not care at all to even show up on time. A facf of life if that you are smart you try to avoid a job with hard schedules and you would rather skip lunch if you can clock out earlier.The video creator could have pointed out some social events and hobbies he had to make it more interesting. And at least suggest that he job was something meaningful or creative that can be done with a laptop like ads, accounting (I’ll allow that as this is somewhat useful and well paid), software, engineering, architecture, CAD designs for glasses, cat pajama designs, anything!The low effort quality of his life is the signature of a beta male. He could have pointed out how he spent an hour at the gym after his 5hr with 2hr lunch-break job (LOL) and played in an amateur ultimate team two times a week. IPA beers with the fellow soy bois would had qualified as having a life too. Even a quirky hobby like origami. Or playing video games with the homies. A fact of life is that spending your free time in a Wathaburger drive thru does not count as living the life.

            Kids who are more online are recognizing it, at least unconsciously, as a video in an established genre: a day in the life of a “professional” who doesn’t do anything. Every prior viral video like this stars a young woman, and is about watching her consume (with quasi-sexual interest).The upper middle class career without work and the “normal life” without *events* are very expensive consumer goods, increasingly inaccessible.Sex-swapping the protagonist in an advertisement for that life makes it even more repulsive.Fuentes just wants to call everybody a loser. He’s gay. That’s what they do.Woods’s complaint is serious. A man decided to show us his life, and what he thought we should see is *nothing* (in a women’s video genre). What produced this perversion?My take: Any young white man with an office job in today’s America—a job young white men are statistically *forbidden* from having—is doing something terrible to the world. He should be hated much more seriously than this.

        The greatest thing Fuentes could do would be to find a good girl, get married, have a ton of kids and encourage all his zoomer followers to do the same. I think many of them would follow him to the ends of the earth.He seemed like a bright kid, it’s unfortunate that he is proving to be such an annoying egomaniac. Maybe he should begin a training routine with Sam Hyde and challenge Shapiro to a match.

        I think males in the younger set realize the landscape has changed to entirely uphill and the smart ones are thinking outside the box. Anecdote, my friend’s 6’3+ ripped and handsome son could be college-bound on a football scholarship. Instead, he resigned from the team, personally thanking everybody especially his coach. The kid had worked multiple jobs to save for a professional camera system. He took courses and apprenticed under a mentor photographer. Now he’s age 17 and pulling down $8,000 per weekend as a high-end wedding photographer with steady work and a portfolio — I didn’t believe this at first but my friend can’t lie well. The son has already taught himself investing and purchased a well-depreciated car with his company logo painted on it. He catches the eyes of many ladies but none his age will date him because he’s sweet and good-natured and still a virgin until marriage, a Christ-fearing Lutheran, he asks them out and gets “ghosted” once the gossip flows and his nature is discussed by the hens. I wish I had that self-awareness at his age but at least I had the opportunity to date girls. That’s gotta retard development somewhat.

            That’s really good! I’m a few hours SE of you, and I know people can pull in $2-5K per gig doing just lighting and DJ for weddings, but, holy crap, $8K for the photographer? Is that just because Chicago, or should I be suggesting people look into it?

                St. Joseph Michigan area. One of my h.s. girlfriends earns even more photographing race horses around the world. But the young man is still a h.s. student and far more centered than I was at his age. I was still taking Latin, running interference for my all-state tailback and working overtime on my sex life.

        The video isn’t disturbing because the subject is shown as holding down a middle-class white-collar job. It’s disturbing–or, rather, depressing because he comes into contact with not a single fellow human being during the course of his very long workday, lunching all by himself, no office chitchat of any kind, no human interaction before or after work that we can see, etc. He looks as though he’s in solitary confinement. Someone has informed me that he has a wife (he’s wearing a wedding ring that I didn’t spot) with a child on the way (how did my informant know that?). In short, the post has nothing to do with “right-wing romanticism,” but rather with a natural human response to sensory deprivation. Man is a social animal, as Aristotle said.

            There’s certainly some truth to that. However, there is also creeping misanthropy in AINO, and perhaps the West in general. And for people so inclined, the lack of human contact might actually be quite appealing.

            I noticed that, too.  No family, just the dog.  Now I’m sure some of that has to do with not wanting to plaster his wife and kid all over the internet.  But they’re not mentioned.my wife and I have a sit down cooked-at-home dinner every night.  TV is off.  Kids sit at the table (if they’re home).I thought we were normal until one of my oldest friends was in town and joined us for dinner.  We sat around the table as a family and said grace like we always do.He changed the subject quickly because I think he was embarrassed, but commented how he wish his dinners had been like this with his wife and three kids.They just made a different choice to be sports parents.  They traveled every night and ate fast food from their cars for 20 years.

        Good insight, Z.
Looking back, it feels to me that the “coffee house right” emerged in the wake of the disastrous Bush administration. (I think Rod Dreher called them “Crunchy Cons”).
Even then it was clear that something new was emerging. Spencer was able to market it and take it for a ride.

        My 17 year old son is a junior in an international high school in Europe. He is so right wing and white-centric it even shocks me…and so is every one of his friends, both here in Central Europe and back in SoCal. He has already let me know that he isn’t going to college, but to welding school. He has no interest in women or a relationship, he thinks modern white western women are useless. I don’t know what to say to him, because, well…I more or less agree. I hope he finds a sort of happiness in his views, God knows I am an 80s guy who found the same thing after 4 kids and 2 wives.

        One of the most self defeating ideas of the Dissident Right is to encourage young men to shun universities and only go into trades. If we want to ever be more than a defeated people and instead run the country again we will have to have doctors, lawyers, bankers, heads of large organizations, architects, etc.You can’t run a country with just welders and truck drivers.There is a lot to be said for welding and the trades rather than corporations but only having those types of jobs condemn the right to always being marginalized.Granted, in the short run the prospects look dim for us but this is where we need to learn from the tribe. Long term thinking and in group bias helped them get power over us. On our side of the divide wealthy men just want to be the richest in the graveyard. We need to do like the left, get money and then use it socially for our cultural benefit

        I know I’m late to join the conversation, but what about the thought that it’s frankly quite disturbing that people record and post the most mundane aspects of their life on the internet…or even that everyday Joe posts anything on the internet for all to see?Is it a kind of narcissism to post that? Or possibly his way of trying to make a human connection? I mean I kinda infer from his shirt and cup to Normalize the Norm or whatever it says that the intent was to show that there’s boring parts of everyone’s life and that’s ok, but maybe that just what I infer from the 1:00 clip and I missed the real point?If we go back in time 50 years and all sit down for Aunt Edna’s trip to the Grand Canyon, it’s like she only took photos of the road side rest stops along the way and no sunsets of the actual destination. And maybe that’s it, maybe the implied reaction is that through individualism it’s impossible to have consensus on what the goal even is? Maybe the social malaise is actually the fact that people have to create their own goals? And let’s be  honest, a great many people are unfit to create goals for themselves (always have been).I guess I just don’t really understand social media and most people’s drive to post anything at all for unfiltered public consumption. And to take it a step further, I don’t know if that’s always been part of the human condition that we couldn’t see because it wasn’t possible before the internet or if it’s a new thing. And maybe what I think is my purposeful interaction with online communities of the like minded with the intent of back and forth feedback is the same thing as this video, but I can’t see the forest for the trees?

        ” His younger fans were right there with him in condemning the traditional definition of success, while the old guys like Matt Walsh werebaffledby the response. From his point of view, the old American right’s point of view, the video guy is living the best life. It is impossible for Walsh to grasp why people like Woods reacted negatively to the video.’“It is important to him that the world knows he rejects the conventional life. His critique of women, heterosexuality and marriage all come from the same rejection of the conventional.”So it’s almost as if the Culture of Critique has infected the entire host population and social media is a massive accelerate.Recognizing the detriments of extreme materialism is certainly valid, but what’s the healthy  opposite of materialism?  Living in a cave?  Meditating all day?   Maybe, but spending a weekend afternoon on my boat drinking beer sounds pretty good, and more beneficial than going online and publishing provocative nonsense (citing Z’s examples, not Z himself) in the hopes for some advert money.

        The issue has nothing to do with tradition- It is the Boomers who have caused this and it is totally the fault of the Boomer’s. They lived in a idyllic world and trashed it for equality and total rejection of Christianity. What we see is the Generation Z and even the younger Gen Alpha  embrace new technology, remote work, independent work and not post high school education.

        Does it truly escape you that, without an ulterior end, one may see no point to the material world, and making it possible, and being in it?I have to work, in order to earn, and live. What if that life isn’t living at all to me? What do I have to work and earn for, in that case?If “life” doesn’t make me feel alive at all?I may try to stomach it, because I know Christ is real (it’s the only really real reality, in fact), and I know I nail It once more to the Cross if I self-kill.But who doesn’t know about Christ, and Its Cross, and the nails of its Cross, why would they stomach a matter-bound existence of toil? What for?

            If I didn’t read this blog I’m not sure I’d be aware Fuentes exists. But then I’m not the best pop culture barometer. Maybe I’m not looking at the websites the cool people look at.
