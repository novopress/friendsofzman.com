        Donald Trump used to be a Clinton Democrat. So maybe it shouldn’t have surprised anyone when he didn’t lock her up, and when he governs like a 1990s Democrat, and “has a heart” for “dreamers.” I remember “hillbillies” getting rather rough treatment in JD Vance’s book/movie. So maybe it shouldn’t surprise anyone when he appears not all that enthusiastic about pardoning J6ers. Sure these guys are better than the alternative. So what else is new? Same old “lesser evil” politics.If I thought it mattered who the Secretary of Defense was, then I might spend more time questioning the judgment of a man twice divorced at 38 who was covered in tattoos. (not that my questioning would matter either, but I enjoy posting here).

            Interesting observation wrt Trump.  We have a “need” to think of “converts” coming over to “our side”.  But really, the converse could also be true.  The country has swung so far to the left, that Rep’s now really are little more than “Clinton era” Dem’s.

                I thought this was obvious (that Trump was basically a ’90s Democrat who looks conservative by the ZOG’s giant leap leftward). But as JZ says, what was the alternative (other than disengagement)?

                    It has always been difficult if not impossible for me (a former Buchanan staffer in 1992 and 1996) to take Trump’s “America First” claims even remotely seriously, given that he called Pat an anti-Semite in 2000 for his use of the term and views of Israel. If it didn’t appeal to Trump in 2000, it sure as hell didn’t in 2015 — but he knew it would work on voters, who are about to get it good and hard from him for a 2nd time.

                        I voted for Trump as the “not totally crazy” and “possibly likes some Americans” candidate.  I don’t understand the rock star/savior treatment at this point. His first term was lackluster on anything people at his rallies actually cared about it. I don’t have high hopes for the 2nd.

                            If you notice, he is much greyer and thinner than just several months ago. He has aged more since November than in the eight years previous. He was given a deal to go to prison for the rest of his life and lose most of his money, or get four years and fight a war.

        I think Z’s “bus theory” applies here. I, like our host, thoroughly enjoyed Vivek destroying the GOP field on the debate stage. It served an end and it was great entertainment.Vivek grew too big for his britches as we say down South by saying we need infinite Indian immigration to create a new South Asian overlord class to replace the Jewish/WASP regime that runs the country.At that moment, I realized his usefulness to the cause had come to an end. For him to do so on Christmas of all days was telling of his alien nature.When one of these guys serve the cause, great. But don’t have emotional ties to these people because they’ll shiv you the next day if it serves their purposes.Trust no one except your friends and family. Or if you do, trust but verify.

            This is a bit of a tangent but personally I’ve always had more contempt for the WASP elite than the Jewish one. The reason is that the WASPs seem to have slavishly copied all the Jews’ ideology (especially the part about “a nation of immigrants”) without understanding that it made no sense outside the Jewish context. Flooding your country with alien migrants makes some sense if it’s not really your country anyway and your main concern is to turn the society into the Star Wars cantina so thatyoudon’t look any more weird than anyone else. It also sure helps if you can backstop all your plans by having a ready-made refuge nation that you can always “go back” to.The WASPs had none of that and are now predictably finding that all the swarthy hordes they invited in to spite the White peasants regard them as just another group of whiteys to be plundered. Watching AOC and the squad attack people like Hillary or Nancy Pelosi is like watching a Three Stooges routine. It’s funnybecauseit’s so stupid and predictable.

It appears “It’s ALL da Jews fault” in the Anglosphere is occasionally also about not facing how traitorous and idiotic our elite have been.. If it’s all the Jews who brought us down, we don’t have took at the people who were meant to rule, at our near relations that threw us under the bus.The Jews POV is understandable, almost. The WASP POV seems to be that they can replace their poorer relatives with “merited” ones that will appreciate them. Then utopia or freedom or something.The Chinese elite appear to have been offered a similar “deal” by the Jews. Relatively speaking, other than a short stint under Mao, they manipulated the situation to get they wanted  and then turned it down flat. To be envious of an otherwise authoritarian government because they care about the people and the future is a weird place to be.“Watching AOC and the squad attack people like Hillary or Nancy Pelosi is like watching a Three Stooges routine.

                “certificate expired”. To anyone who’s having a problem, try Firefox. The site is virtually unreadable in Chrome even if you click “advanced options” and then make a security exception for the site. I’m using the site just fine in Firefox though after making an exception for it.

            Cenk is an easy one to spot as he was such a vitriolic lier for the Left in his previous incarnation. Ana I’ve never heard of.  In any event, I took today’s missive as pertaining to those more borderline grifters.  Hard to believe anyone with adequate prior knowledge can fall for such conversions.

                Ana was every bit the lunatic as Cenk.  Watch her comical performance on election night 2016, for evidence.  But women like her are true believers at every turn.  It she comes to the right, she’ll remain rabidly partisan on its behalf.  Until she isn’t.  And the warning signs will be quite obvious.  In other words, she won’t be prone to subterfuge.  What you see is what you get.

        The Soviet view of traitors broke down into two distinct groups: those who were motivated by money, and those motivated by ideology. The former group was looked down on, while the latter, which included Philby were viewed more favorably, although never entirely trusted. The KGB was not persuaded that Philby’s loyalties were genuine, even up until the time he passed away.
FWIW, Philby was also a serial adulterer.

        I’d say dogs bringing and (mostly) taking bones pretty much describes all our politicians at every level in the US and across the entire west, for that matter.  Morality has been so perverted and nuanced over the past few decades, will the clear distinction between right and wrong, trustworthiness and untrustworthiness ever make a comeback?

This! I can no longer trust anyone except in my personal, close circle of friends whom I’ve known for years. Trust simply can’t be earned through media contact anymore. That is what we’ve (and others) have discussed before. We have lost our innocence and now live in a society of distrust. Multiracialism has destroyed this society’s greatest strength.

Causal oversimplification. You belong to a people who have casually dissembled about reality for thousands of years. Many of you are so fond of fiction that, to amuse yourselves, you bamboozle your own children to believe happy drivel like Santa Claus and his gifts, but this is just one of your many small lies. Gigantic lies include “We the People…do ordain and establish…” and “Jesus is lord”. When the lies are exposed you feign innocence and shift blame to the dusky replacements.
Ye have no shame.

                    Robert Putnam desperately wanted to agree with you about multiracialism, but his research in “Bowling Alone” forced him to agree with Compsci.  Although Putnam was a liberal, he could not go against the European respect for truth, which Z Man mentioned.

                        “European respect for truth”? LOL.That’s found among very few Europeans, esp. those of the USA, and Compsci isn’t one of these people. How can we know that I’m right? Think of the Religious Wars of a few centuries ago. While not exclusively religious, they were fired up by disgreement about how best to idolize a dirty, rotten Israelite who premeditated his own death at the hands of the Sanhedrin and the Romans. (Fyi, that’s like suicide by cop.)Had there been any great and widespread respect in Europe for truth, the rulers and many of the people would have agreed that mass apostasy is a good remedy to religious disputes between protesters and papists. Apostasy would have drained the Religious Wars of the fanaticism which made them so deadly. Sustaining that mass apostasy would have assured that today there’e be no tolerance for an abomination called theCharlemagne Prize, named for one of the worst scoundrels of (((Western))) history. The deceitfulness of Jesus’ ministers and enthusiasts would play at most a trivial role in ruining trust and obstructing its cultivation where found lacking.

                            “Whether or not there is multiracial discord now is irrelevant to the point”… that multiracialism destroys trust?  Fascinating deductive reasoning there.  You’re a real intellectual heavyweight.
The falsity is so obvious you can’t even explain it, can you?
Our greatest strength was homogeneity and the unity that comes with a homogeneous society.  Unity produces trust since most everyone is of the same race/culture/religion and is working towards the same goal.  I could see why this would upset you.

You can feel the disappointment and fear.Sure, the MAGA army will be there on the 20th in DC, much like the convention this summer (Tattoo MAGA, ex-porn star MAGA, Rappin’ MAGA), but for serious people, the finality of this has been extremely sobering over the past few weeks. It’s like a steel door has shut forever. The fires in California are an exclamation point on something that many are realizing, which is that there is no way back to 1991 now, and the future is a blue tarp on the side of the interstate.

        Watched a video of Jean Chretien last night.  When speaking of the house of parliament he said “a leader needs to remember, his opponents face him on the other bench.  His enemies are behind him…..

        Another spot on observation Z man- Ben Shapiro was and still is a “never Trumper”;The thing is that NPCs, normies and many Boomer Cons and Grill Cons do not care- The Republicans will fail to make significant change and  suffer defeat in 2026.The laws and crack downs will impact far more low social/ economic class Americans with fines and long prison time. I can say we will have a big was in the middle east- it will whip up military recruitment and shut down debate of the conservative and nationalist and many of those peoples children will be forced into service. Many of the new administration  appointees are globalist and clown world neocons. Yes, they will do whatever it takes to maintain power.

        The version I’ve heard is: “If he’ll cheat with you, he’ll cheat on you.” There is a scene in the John Ford movie “The Informer” that illustrates the attitude toward a traitor: A Black and Tan is tasked with giving the reward to the informer. He slides the money across the table, careful not to make any contact with the man.

        Ratio scorecards for media?
Why not start with the legacy print and broadcast media as they have broad and deep commentary and stenography. Use some type of metric that is less subject to bots or NPC inputs. League tables to show who is doing what to whom.
Results should show that outlets once trusted have earned the opprobrium of their shrinking customer base.
Beta test that, then expand to include politicians.
