        I can understand the power of mass delusion, having voted for Carter back in the day. When Obama first ran, I kept trying to point out to people how unqualified he was for the office. They looked at me like I was crazy. I mentioned the “57 states” quote and they didn’t believe it. They were so happy and smug when he won.When we look back on American history, there are Presidents that make us question what they were thinking when they elected them. It may take some time for the good press to fade but some day, history will recognize what an awful President Barack Obama has been
