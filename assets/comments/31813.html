        A reading, for harmony and constructive teamwork a few years from now. Twenty-seven verses.

As before, there are several instances of lev, the pump in our chests, yet we read, “Let thine lev retain my words”. For how long could Israel’s leaders, or Christian leaders, tolerate rigorous biology and textual criticism in their own midst without subverting their political goal—conquest of all nations and the whole world?

This is one of those things that shows there is a difference between looking at things empirically/statistically and intuitively and how they don’t always overlap.
Bill Clinton, at least according to this tweet was a statesman who helped bring the US into the 21st century. He also self policed the American left wing. Yet I know z hated Bill Clinton in the 90s and if you listen to William pierces old broadcasts from then, you’d think wjc had devil horns.
So maybe Bill Clinton was far left, but that he changed the definition of what it was.

        “Mark Cuban assumes people make these judgements about race, thus making it more difficult for qualified nonwhites to gain access to positions for which they are qualified.”Sounds like basic stat’s and some sampling theory.  In stat’s, what is the probability of selecting a qualified candidate from a pool containing 90% unqualified vs 10% qualified.  Now compare that question to another pool (White) where 50% are unqualified and 50% qualified.  Mix the two pools and then ask, what are the chances of picking a qualified candidate from the combined pools given the proportions of each pool?  What is the probability that the qualified candidate is White as compared to say, Black?In any event, the solution to maximizing employer success *is* to separate such pools of candidates by race.  This would not occur if meritocracy was the determining factor in who entered each pool instead of AA.  Yes, as pointed out the resulting numbers of Blacks would be less, but they’d have the same “chance” as any particular White candidate in selection.  This of course will never change since a fair chance is not what minorities want—they want payback on YT, and seem to have no shame wrt how they got it.  Shame and embarrassment is a White thang.

        I think what Zman is driving at with this essay is that unless “meritocracy” is merely a dog whistle for true freedom of association, it will end in tears for the majority of whites remaining in AINO. The elites, who have no compunction about defining a term to satisfy their predilections, will simply reject any conception of meritocracy that doesn’t serve their interests. Note that IQ proxies like the SAT, the ACT and the GRE have become “optional” in deciding access to the most selective tertiary education programs. Are whites prepared to be told that, despite excellent markers of traditional academic success, their sons or daughters should only aspire to trades or the retail service economy. This is not a knock on welders, electricians, waitresses and retail clerks, all of which are good and necessary roles in our society; but the reality is that choices will be limited for ideological reasons and some “merit” will be be made more worthy than another. At its root social hierarchy is about power dominance; and in AINO today money is power. He who pays the piper calls the tune. I know next to nothing about Rufo; but the problem with Cuban is that he’s a billionaire, pure and simple.So, the real issue is that we have to change the source if power (and it’s not likely to be meritocracy) or we need billionaires who support our agenda of restoring free association. That’s why you see a lot of dissident chatter about Elon Musk. But, call me a cynic, I think that path is a quest for a unicorn. At this stage, I think the only realistic option is to throw sand into the gears of their power structures. In other words, Sampson’s got to bring the temple of finance down, which is going to immiserate everyone painfully in the short term. The wisest course of action for most of us is to become antifragile, or at least far more resilient, to the impact of economic collapse.

            I think the best example of the fakeness of “merit” was when the ching chongs were trying to take over the Ivy Leagues from the juice.   When little Schmoikel has his violin lesson that’s him demonstrating the kind of creative passion and breadth of interest that makes for a Harvard man.  When little Ping Pong has his violin lesson he’s simply mechanically playing the instrument in a cynical attempt to get admitted,  Sort of like in Star Trek when Data would play a musical instrument flawlessly and the rest of the crew were suddenly expert music critics that derided his playing as soulless.

            Even if it were the case that all non-white groups would accept strict meritocracy, even if it meant fewer of them in lucrative, prestigious positions, diversity would still be terrible for whites for all sorts of other reasons. The debate over meritocracy and freedom of association is merely one thread in a complex tapestry.

            “ Note that IQ proxies like the SAT, the ACT and the GRE have become “optional” in deciding access to the most selective tertiary education programs.”Indeed, but not quite how people think of the process.  Unqualified, or lessor qualified minorities were being given a “helping hand” waaay before such proxies were being considered for elimination. They simply added “bonus” points to the overall evaluation scoring, and viola, the SAT, ACT, and GRE disadvantage was eliminated.The problem was that these candidates now had a record in their transcript of their original SAT, ACT, and GRE scores.  These scores became known and used to evaluate the minority’s outcomes as compared to other candidates not so given a “helping” hand.  Since the minority students inevitable ranked lower in their class standings, career progress, or even failed to graduate at all, the failure of AA became widely displayed to the public.  Hence the entrance exams had to go.

        This isn’t just a race thing. Men are not allowed to have their own spaces.Sports leagues, private clubs, gyms, golf courses you name it.We know what happens when women invade male spaces. It becomes something other than what it originally was…But women can have their own males excluded spaces. Of course little is ever made of this because men aren’t interested in invading female spaces unless they are gay or weirdo’s. But that’s besides the point.The constitution guarantees the right to freedom of assembly. Which means you are not legally obligated to admit anyone into a groups or individuals private club, group, or organization, business or property.All peoples from the beginning of time have understood this basic concept.The govt has no business telling any individual, group, club, organization, company, league or whatever whom they must admit.Force the women and blacks in and what do you get? You get the chaos  and disfunction we are currently living with.

            Freedom of Association from what I can gather is based mostly on the first amendment, specifically “the right of the people to peaceably assemble.” But I can see (without researching it) that it would be limited to public protests and that sort of thing. Incidentally, that would make DeSantis style anti-BDS legislation problematic with an honest judiciary.
I suppose you could make a tenth Amd. argument,  but those don’t seem to do well.

                    Don’t get me wrong, I 100% agree with freedom of association.  Just don’t expect the current AINO to accept it, and would not rely on the “Constitution” to help much.
On the other hand, FoA has become such a strong part of the American lexicon that most people  believe it is in there, somewhere, so maybe it is (hence my reference to the 10th).  What a SCrOTUS would do with it, who knows.

            I’m coming to see destruction of men’s spaces as *the* disaster of our time.   The backbone of society is male social bonds.  Women can’t do it.   Telling a woman to ‘know her place’ is the unspeakable crime yet ‘knowing our place’ is what men do day in day out, in the workplace, at church, or on a football field.  Men are good at knowing our place.  That’s how a system works.  Once women are admitted, the system freezes up because the usual social cues are out of place.  Society becomes dominated by grifters and freaks.Probably the breakdown of men’s spaces is a somewhat natural phenomenon caused by the alienating social distances of large-scale society.  But elites are more than happy to encourage it.  The rich are pleased to see troublesome men’s spaces such as labor unions, and other guilds neutralized.  The trouble now is, these places were society’s feeder teams, and now our society has no bench.  There’s nowhere for the next generation of men to emerge from, and instead of having backbone, our society is a blob.

                I love what you’re saying here. As a child my family belonged to a private yacht club. I enjoyed learning to swim and sail there in the summer. In the winter we would go to dinner and enjoy things like the annual Christmas party. However, there was one place where we were not welcome. It was on the Men’s Porch, a short distance from the Tap Room bar. You could see the old gentlemen sitting on the several rockers there, screened with a trellis, looking out at the boats in the harbor and on the Sound. The Victorian-era clubhouse itself was full of masculine relics, models of ships, a library full of books about ships and sailing, also wars upon the seas such as the steam whistle from the USS Maine, sunk in Havana Bay!  I understood as a (girl) child that these men deserved to be left with their thoughts and discussions with their friends out of hearing women’s chatter and socializing. I’m a woman and enjoy this aspect of femininity but it does not diminish me one bit to stay away from the Men’s Porch and let them be. Being ‘pushy’ was always something to avoid when I was growing up. No one was ‘clubworthy’ who found this a problem!

        Rufo has managed to carve out a niche for himself in a smart way, but in the end, the colorblind meritocracy is not going to work and cannot work. We all know this. Yet normies are starting to get it too. Rufo talks a lot about overturning Griggs vs. Duke Energy, which was the famous case that helped establish disparate impact. I agree with him that it should be overturned. Yet what will that accomplish? The same thing tht happened when the Court overturned AA in college admissions – they’ll just find a way to do the same thing, differently. People notice this. People notice that Boeing ran headlines trumpeting their diversity push a few years ago and now their planes are falling apart in the sky. We all know about the story Bloomberg ran last year, trumpeting the fact that 94% of hires in Fortune 500 companies were vibrant. I think Bloomberg actually wrote that story with pride, thinking, “look at what we have done!”. I think they were also shocked at the backlash amongst White people that the story produced, since it confirmed what everybody has observed and known to be true for years. It was so bad that they had to roll out some people to claim that Bloomberg botched the math.I don’t think Rufo is a bad guy, a grifter, a con man, like many in conservative circles. I think he’s done good work in Florida. His fatal flaw is that he does not realize that a colorblind meritocracy can only work in a society that is majority of European descent.

It could probably work in any society where a significant majority are committed to it. Problem is, with few exceptions, Europeans are pretty much the only ones willing to play by those rules. And not even all whites; somewhere around half are fine with racism, so long as it’s against whites.
There are vanishingly few who are OK with racism against anyone you damn well please.

                I have seen absolutely no evidence whatsoever that some non-White group of people will be fine with running a colorblind meritocracy, especially when it means their people will be displaced by Whites. All studies show that only Whites have the out-group preferences that make it possible. Everybody else sees taking care of their own as their first priority.

                    I’m not talking about groups of people. Whites are the group that is most amenable to a meritocracy, and half of us are opposed. Many whites who support meritocracy would not benefit from it anyway.
There are a minority of people in other races who are pro-meritocracy, but so far as I can tell, they are exclusively the ones who would benefit.
That’s one reason Rawls is completely scooters. The only ones who would play “fair” under his “veil of ignorance” are the melanin-challenged.

                “There are vanishingly few who are OK with racism against anyone you damn well please.”I’d agree that few Whites take a “principled” view of racism as you set out here because of course it legitimizes the anti-White racism we see all through society today. There are many, myself included, however, who are fine with tribalism (call it racism if you like) for Whites since everyone else is going to do it. In other words when I get the invitation that says “Please come to the gunfight at the OK Corral at high noon today. Do not bring a gun!” Well, I’m bringing my gun. Actually several with extra preloaded mags.Real world example – I was laid off months ago and am still looking (the tech scene is terrible right now because of all the lay offs). Every day I get recruiter spam from utterly noxious Pajeets. Sometimes I respond out of desperation but of course I would love to not have to deal with these slimy fuckers. They have almost totally taken over tech recruiting and it wasn’t because they believed in “meritocracy”. I’m pretty sure most couldn’t even pronounce the word but then they can barely pronounce any normal English words either.TL;DR: as Lineman would say, tribe up or die.

                    I’m a bad one to talk, because I essentially “tribed up” through white flight 20+ years ago, but while tribalism is an answer, it’s a poor answer. Might be the best we can do, but I hate the thought of abandoning the “man of his word” society that essentially built Western civilization.
Look at a map of all the fiefdoms of Europe after the fall of Rome. Many were less than a day’s walk across. Similarly-sized autarkic tribes would put us back to Dark Age in a hurry.

Division of labor. It was only those fiefdoms willing to trade, to capitalize on their comparative advantage, instead of being autarkic (Is that a word? It is now.) that made it possible to develop the civilization we did.
No one else has done that anywhere else in the world. If one wanted evidence of white superiority, that’s it. I’d hate to toss that advantage in the dustbin over ideology.

                    Where I live the “pajeets” are either doctors (surgeons? I hope not!) or proprietors of liquor stores. Same last names, the Hindu equivalents of Smith or Jones! The surgeons’ wives are very involved in the local social ladies’ swim. Not sure how the old-time local families like this but they do pay up for the various important parties. In other words, no one really likes them but their money is good (Hindus) for the various local charity projects. Their children are also at the best schools, preferably private, and do very well academically. Sports not so much. And in recent years the under-forties are running for public office! As I said, they are pushy!

            Mycale: “Rufo talks a lot about overturning Griggs vs. Duke Energy, which was the famous case that helped establish disparate impact. I agree with him that it should be overturned.”“Griggs” is just one edge of the knife: “Griggs” says that employers are FORBIDDEN to discriminate against a COLORED job applicant on the basis of the applicant’s stupidity.But the other edge of the knife is “Jordan versus New London”, which states that employers are ALLOWED [encouraged even] to discriminate against a WHITE job applicant on the basis of the applicant’s acuity.Both Griggs &amp; Jordan have to go.Obviously everything in Klownworld/Hellscape has to go.But the destruction of Klownworld/Hellscape gets us immediately into Ph3d P0@sting territory, so I’ll just stick to the legalistics, and call it quits for the rest of this thread.

        “Rufo thinks you should be required to hire the black guy as long as he meets the objective criteria for the job”I agree with the thesis of today’s article. However, the above statement seems falsifiable. I have only read reviews of Rufo’s book, but I think he is aiming to get rid of affirmative action now called DEI. I don’t know if I have ever heard him argue in favor of freedom of association, (cowards have replaced that value with merit as a disguise/proxy), nor against it.It is true that it would be best if the yet another proxy called merit was not used as a substitute for freedom of association, but I don’t know that Rufo is against the latter. Happy to be proven wrong here.

        The uniparty model scales up and it scales down. People are much easier to herd and control when their “choices” come from a limited menu. Up at the top of the menu it says FREEDOM in bold. Look at all the choices!I used to watch Shark Tank sometimes. As late night CNBC programming goes, I prefer American Greed. Anyhow, Cuban never impressed me. But I get the feeling we’re supposed to think he’s “reasonable,” or “moderate,” or something like that. People floated the idea of him running for president. Evidently he’s one of the billionaires we’re supposed to like, not one of the billionaires we’re supposed to hate.Zman, I appreciate your telling me about what the smart set is arguing about, because God knows I couldn’t bear to witness it myself.

            “People are much easier to herd and control when their ‘choices’ come from a limited menu.”
This realization was one of the shocks that radicalized me.
When I still had hope for our political system, my main concern was immigration and border control.
Eventually, I realized that I would never get a candidate who expressed my ideas because they would never get financial backing from the small number of donors who control the politicians whose most people even recognize.
Burn it all down.

        “As we see with the race issue, it is not always clear that they both agree on the ends, but once you strip away the rhetoric it is clear that at the minimum, they agree with one another”This general situation over what looks like clear differences happens very often in Normieworld, and not just with respect to race. Two sides, “left” and “right,” smugly have an argument over something where the real issues never arise. Take neocons versus neoliberals. Both want to overthrow governments and start wars but use different excuses. “We have to fight those guys over there because they don’t like our freedom!” “We have to topple that regime because they’re mean to homosexuals!” But we always have to kill people far away and keep expanding the MIC. Take immigration. “We have to put a stop to illegal entry! We have to make legal immigration work because they will become future businessmen!” “No person is illegal! We have to let them in because they fled oppression and seek a better life!” Yet the hordes must flow, either way.As the saying goes, it’s all so tiresome. Seeing some righteous, highly opinionated normie of either stripe revel in “owning” the other side merely looks absurd now. Watching some retard on The Daily Show take a smug jab at some Republican or Ben Shapiro “destroy” some halfwit woke college student proves nothing except you cannot find real discussion anywhere in mainstream media, or even on its fringes.

        One day, while drifting in the human stream, I saw a log float by – the sturdy old log was intelligence. Instead of grabbing it and hanging on, I let it drift by.
A while later I struck a rock in the stream – a large rock that was jagged and the shock slammed me to the core. The rock was reality. As I attempted to gather my wits and recover from the hard hit against the rock, the log slammed into me. And I am no longer the same as I once was.

        Is there strategic value to be gained from high level analysis of societal pathology as described in today’s post? Yes, but it’s not for the sake of education, awareness, or even future debating success. The real value is in its use as camouflage. Sometimes you have to get in close, and in order to do that, you must adopt the correct appearance and demeanor in order to gain access to the inner sanctum. Tradecraft is a high level skill. Think outside the box.

                To reinvigorate your brain (and have some fun in the process), its best to use this knowledge resource provided by our host in service to the development of potential solutions for what ails us. This solution matrix can take many forms (per the skill and preferences of the originator), but it is a worthy use of one’s time. Think of it as contingency planning if that makes it more palatable.

        The problem is they both have the same priors.  Those priors were inculcated in them as children and reinforced daily ever since.  Most people have never been exposed to any counter information. It’s not just bad information they’ve been exposed to, it’s how it was (and is) exposed to them.  It’s done in emotionally manipulative ways so that when or if they are briefly exposed to different information, they react emotionally to it. Not only do they have this emotional priming, they are well aware that deviating from the approved narrative will have extremely devastating consequences.

            Or that Israel needs more Arabs and Africans.  It’s good to remember Mark “Cuban” is not a Cuban.  He doesn’t care about the US. It’s not his home.  It’s just where he happens to reside at the moment.  He’s not an American, he never will be American and most importantly, he knows it.
As preposterous as it sounds to us, in his sick and twisted mind, we could suddenly and for no reason whatsoever, break out in a fit of antisemitism and start building our own Sobibors and Auschwitzes.  For this reason, this is not his home.

            Strictly speaking, you are correct. However, “diversity,” as understood today in AINO, means non-white. And increasingly, it means negro. So, in selecting 90+% negroes for his roster, he’s hewing strongly to the diktats of diversity. Far better, of course, would be comprising his rosters of nuttin’ but nuggs. I imagine Steven A. Smith has rapped him on the knuckles about that a time or two.

                I’ve been watching some of the March sportsball. I note that the two favored teams in the final 4 are heavily white, frequently with 4 or 5 white guys on the floor simultaneously. Even Alabama, historically known for coal black teams, has a couple of white guys out there on the regular. So far it seems like people are pretending this isn’t happening, I don’t hear a word about it. But I wonder if it is an early stage trend.

                    As the anti-white pogrom progresses in tandem with a popular culture that is effectively black culture you will probably see more and more white athletes excelling even in fast-twitch muscle fiber sports like basketball.
Sports will be at once a place where young white men can escape their new ghetto or in some cases embrace going into or coming out of the black ghetto.

                    Right now, two of the best players in the NBA are European Whites. They’re on such a high tier relative to the rest of the league that the sports shouters will call you racist if you support them over their chosen black players. This is how one of them (Jokic) lost a MVP to an inferior player (Embiid) last year.Many, many of the White players in the NBA are European, to the point where it’s hard not to notice. I have long thought that the AAU system that basketball players grow in discriminates against Whites. It’s dominated by blacks and chosen neither of whom want to help Whites out. I think athletic White kids are told to play another sport, or if they really want to play basketball, they have to go about it through other means.They’re also not looked at as serious NBA prospects which means they stay in school longer, which means that the college teams are more cohesive and experienced. Last year Alabama had a much touted black player, Brandon Miller, who was mixed up in a murder case (seriously), and a #1 seed… and the team flamed out before the Final Four.

                    The reality is that white football and basketball players are undervalued, and the coaches who realize this–Danny Hurley, Matt Painter, etc.–have a huge advantage because it’s far easier to recruit these guys. The competition for their services is nowhere near as intense as it is for Shaq’Slay’vion Hembrick.As an aside, I strongly suspect whites, despite the institutionalized descrimination against them, will become increasingly prominent in basketball over the next 20 years or so. The reason for this is that white parents’ fear over concusions in football will cause them to veto little Kayden playing football and push him into basketball instead. Sassy Mammies, OTOH, don’t care much if little Ty’Reeko gets his brain scrambled just so long as he’s buying her infinite weaves 10 years down the road with his NFL bucks.

                    Ah, someone else noticed this too. I had literally paid no attention whatsoever to this year’s NCAA tournament until I decided to look at some UConn highlights just because they have been so dominant. I expected to see the usual dreadlocks, palming, travelling, showboating antics that have made basketball unwatchable. Imagine my surprise seeing three white starters anchoring a team that passes well, runs the floor, plays relentless defense and appears unbeatable. Maybe there is hope for basketball after all.

                I think that’s a better summary of Cuban’s views. It’s not that he opposes racism. He’s fully supports racism directed against whites.
That’s why they decided to redefine things such that blacks could not be racist. Even in a majority black city, run by majority or even exclusively black politicians, police, etc., they are victims of white oppression. Notice whenever we talk about the hellholes those cities become, they completely skip over the power angle they use elsewhere?

        Left out of your picture, but clearly part of the same propaganda, is the owner of Twitter. Cuban and Musk have also gone back and forth on the topic too.
Yet, you reserve your criticism for these two. Why?
Put together your waxing poetic about Musk and the politics you promote, and you can’t help but wonder if the purpose here is to funnel dissidents to–and eventually get them to accept–the Thiel-Yarvin technocracy.

            I cannot ever recall Mr. Z Man “waxing poetic” about Musk. He seems to discuss his various merits and failings, always with an eye on the fact thathe isn’t really on this side.
I must say, the commentaries on X or Twitter or whatever it is (Musk in this example), tend to bore me. But I’ve never looked at Z as a champion for Musk by any stretch.

                I think of Musk (and people in his league of wealth) somewhat the way I would think about an alien who came to Earth openly and started interacting with people the way they do with each other. He has the freedom to evaluate all this “human stuff” objectively and dispassionately just like our alien friend. So now you know what that freedom costs too – about 1/4 trillion.

        It’s all so tiresome.  I think what depresses me the most is that Rufoism is about as far as you’re going to get normal white people to go.  Getting them to our side is nearly impossible.  Even if they know it, it is considered unthinkable to accept that blacks are an inferior cognitive race.  They will point to their black friend who has a high IQ and say “see?!  You’re generalizing!”.To be fair, I’m sensitive to this issue because IMHO it is the only issue that matters and it is the foundation of the left’s existence.Diversity also doesn’t mean actual diversity.  For instance, a team of 10 people consisting of all black males is considered “diverse”.   What does that tell you?  As long as there are no whites allowed, it’s a diverse team.I work in software which is obviously a heavy STEM field.  My black worship center desperately tries to hire non whites but has struggled to do so.  Outside of our fat, angry black lady (chief diversity officer) – yes that’s her actual title, there are a whopping ZERO black engineers.  Plenty of Asians, plenty of whites.  It is a reminder that reality greatly disagrees with fantasy.The way my company gets around the diversity requirements is they have a whole batch of low IQ morons offshore who are non white.  These “engineers” can’t think or solve problems and they cost the company millions, but hey, they raise the ESG score.I can’t see how this will ever be “fixed”.  Most young people who are wait have already been programmed to hate themselves and are either transgender or some other spiteful mutant to shed their “oppressor” status.  It is a hopeless endeavor to get civ nats to accept race realism.  I was once a color blind conservative too I guess, but for me the jump to this side of the divide came quickly.  For most whites, it is a bridge too far, the brainwashing is just far too strong.

                Putting in my two cents worth, civnats (I was once one too) cannot be persuaded into race realism by force of argument.  Some thing, or some process, will cause a civnat to realize that not all men and races are created equal, that evolution affected races differently, and that racial differences are largely responsible for different racial performances and comportment.
As the Good Witch of the North tells the characters in Oz before Dorothy returns to Kansas, “She had to find it out for herself.”

                    Excellent point. From my teenage years through my early 40s I fought valiantly to reject race realism. God only knows the casuistry, theology and rationalizations I deployed to deny the obvious truth of negro inferiority. To my mind, the truth was simply too monstrous to accept. Then, in the year 2010, a Hutu pack moved into the house across the street. And here I am at Z-man’s blog…

                        I think that is what it take but it’s still not enough for some.  What comes to mind is the retired police chief who was killed by the vibrants in the stolen car or Ethan Liming who was stomped to death.
The father rushed to tell the world it’s not about race.  The chief’s daughter did the same thing.
Your son was murdered by violent animals and that isn’t enough…. Remarkable.

                        I never express an opinion about how tough it is for normal Whites to “convert” because I feel that my upbringing in Baltimore gave me an edge. Indeed, one of the few good things about growing up one of our East Coast or Midwestern big city shitholes is that you get a first hand, unfiltered look at the Negro. For me becoming a dissident was just a matter of abandoning what I had always felt was an ill-fitting false facade. I do not know if Whites from whiter parts of the country would find the transition as easy.I can say definitively, that most of the White shitlibs here in the PNW do actually seem to believe the egalitarian narrative that blacks are where they are due to “systemic racism”. Portland and the other cities along the I-5 corridor, though, are themselves fake and gay. The white populations of these places are almost entirely from other parts of the country and moved here specifically to participate in shitlib culture.A more important question is what does that Iowa farm kid think? He grew up and still lives in a very White place. He’s been brainwashed as well but doesn’t have the unfiltered view of blacks that I got. How hard is it for him to dissent?

                        I was a confirmed CivNat until Obama’s election, whereupon I discovered that black Americans had apparently voted en-massse for the Hawaiian stoner regardless of their previously-stated political affiliation. Many, increasingly uncomfortable questions followed this initial shock to my earnestly-held assumptions about race at the time…

                    civnats (I was once one too) cannot be persuaded into race realism by force of argument.True, so far as it goes. Civnats have a picture in their minds of how a colorblind society would work, kumbyah and all. In order to compete with that, you need not argument, but a better vision of the future that comports with their moral framing. It can’t just be, “Take that picture and erase all the Jews and blacks and browns” unless you can explain a path to that place that also comports with morality.You are never going to argue whites into being immoral.

In my experience, no. NAXALT and all that, but on the whole, they are convinced that they are taking the moral high road, and only rarely will one abandon his morality for argument. And it’s a little dangerous to trust anyone whose morals were so easily set aside.

Short answer, no. CivNats are what they are because of principle. They will not abandon their moral answer for empirical evidence, particularly after the games that have been played with climate change and COVID. You need to replace their moral principle with a better moral principle.

            As to your friend accusing you of generalizing about blacks, a quote from Goethe sums it up nicely:“I have often felt a bitter sorrow at the thought of the German people, which is so estimable in the individual and so wretched in the generality…”Just substitute ‘the black people’ for the ‘German people’ and there you have it.

            Diversity is good, more diversity is better, and complete diversity is best. Ergo, bye bye whitey.
Diversity is nothing more than the rhetorical device cloaking the plot to effectively eliminate whites by submerging them in a sea of non-whites.

            “My black worship center desperately tries to hire non whites but has struggled to do so.”
That was true in my grad school program thirty years ago. Our department chair told the student newspaper, verbatim, that he was “bending over backwards” trying to hire a black professor.
He finally did, and the guy lasted a year. The black dude kept moving on from one university to the next, playing the affirmative action con.
I recently looked him up — thirty years later, he’s doing visiting professor gigs and isn’t tenured. Apparently his “academic work” is on “racism in academe”…

            Hey TC. It was you who coined the term Black Worship Center. That is brilliant and spot on. Well done. I’ve done time in a BWC or two the past 15 years.I have to agree with J Zoar. I have a similar background and path as him. We cannot despair. There are those who the BWC humiliations and who can foresee the endgame who this pogrom have woken up early. I am one of them. More and more white people are finding themselves left out or pushed out. Once you take away the promises and it is no longer someone else’s problem you will have a huge host of people who are joining us. Better to prepare to lead in some way than to waste time in despair.Brilliant and most apt description of corporate America I have ever seen. Take that mainstream. Well done.

                And Norway is Norway because it is filled with Norwegians. We used to get lectures in the 1980s about the successful “socialisms” of northern Europe. Don’t hear that stuff anymore.

        Conservatives like Rufo believe those to his left are racist, whereas Cuban believes those to his right are racist. I’ve never seen any difference between mainstream American progressivism and conservativism when it comes to this.
For example, if you dropped into a conversation between these two without any knowledge of their other political beliefs, one would be justified — after listening to them call each other racist for 30 minutes — that these are children and nothing more. It is pathetic to have to live among these fools.

            Too much credit. He’s not even smart enough to understand what you’re implying—as in, Kevin MacDonald-like formulations are beyond Cuban’s ability to recognize, let alone to scheme.His hostility to white Americans, evident even in his choice of Mavericks, may be rooted in an ethnic tendency. And it’s encouraged by the billionaire/media social milieu, also highly “ethnic.” But the reason he claims diversity is a universal good is because he’s stupid. Reality and his mind have never met.Additionally—“Despite being a billionaire…” Listen to a billionaire talk, or if you really want to be stunned, read his book. Any billionaire’s. Elon’s normie-con tweets tower above them all, and he’s not even a midwit.“But—!”AOC is an economist, graduate cum laude from a highly ranked, highly selective university to which *not one of us* reading this blog would be admitted today.

        Aw, come on! Lay off Rufo! It’s like dwarves griping about elves’ efforts against Mordor in here!
He literally just got the University of Texas to abolish its DEI apparatus:
https://christopherrufo.com/p/abolished?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1248321&amp;post_id=143244653&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=b725u&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email
No wonder he gets regular death threats from the Left. He’s actually out there fighting – and winning – while too many on our side are whining and carping, caught up in purity spirals that only lead to inaction. The few bucks I throw his way (as with Z) I consider money well spent.

            Jannie:  Zman is not attacking him.  He’s simply using him as an example of one of the many flaws of conservatards.  The “enemy” is anyone who is not explicitly pro-White.  Since Rufo is pushing standard color-blindness, he is not “winning” anything for White people generally and the dissident right specifically.He is also married to a Thai – who may be a lovely woman – but as the father of mixed-race children he is of minimal utility as a purported ‘defender’ of White people.  Just like J.D. Vance, who’s married to a subcon and has brown children.This makes people like Rufo and Vance just slightly whiter versions of Candance Owens or Thomas Sowell – yet another non-White talisman to protect them from feeling raycist for taking their own side.

                Show me the “explicitly pro-White” activist who is having Rufo’s impact.In France there is Marion Marechal and Eric Zemmour (Jewish and also a French patriot – yes, we used to have those in America, like Irving Berlin), I don’t see anyone like them in America. So who do we have? Rufo’s work is importantly rolling back the enemy. We can argue the toss with him over race later. The reality is that we live in a multiracial society, and we either enforce an apartheid system for winners and losers, enforce a colorblind system like Singapore (https://says.com/my/news/lee-kuan-yew-on-race-based-politics-and-why-it-will-destroy-our-society), Balkanize like Yugoslavia, let everyone just do their own thing (good luck!), or move towards a two-tier Latin American/Californian model of lip-service to platitudes with unwritten de facto apartheid. Pick your poison!However, if we allow pure merit, say, for our elite universities, East Asians will dominate and we will end up with an East Asian ruling class – with all that entails. Otherwise we have to favor some kind of de jure racial affirmative action/discrimination for other races (including Whites)…or “colorblind” may end up with more like a color spectrum.As for marriage, ideally people with the same race and culture marry since (based on my own experience) those kind of differences tend to explode into massive problems under the pressures of cohabitation. But at the same time, marriage is a highly personal institution, and some mixed unions do work out. I don’t think it’s generally advisable, but people are all different. Women especially are more rooted in their own place and culture, while men more easily “go native”. Just my own observations.The immediate priority is defeating the enemy. Rufo is accomplishing this and should be supported, whatever our differences. Too many on our side seem to be waiting for the Based Aryan Superman to shake himself free of the Antarctic ice and come flying to our rescue. Ain’t gonna happen.

                    I like your post, especially your penultimate sentence. However, colorblind admissions to universities won’t result in an East Asian ruling class for two reasons. First, their IQ advantage over whites is only marginal. Second, the percentage of East Asians in AINO is much smaller than the white percentage.

                        Truth. I’m not in the slightest worried about Asians. While they are great at copying and making minor improvements, very few of them create anything new. To be fair, that’s true of all groups, but whites disproportionately have that little extra perseverance or stubbornness or whatever that puts them over the top. Edison’s 99% perspiration.
Now if the civnats turn out to be right and that’s not genetic but cultural, well, we still outnumber them…

                    Jannie:  In regards to any public pundit’s success and impact, I have to honestly admit I don’t follow or listen to any of them – so I only know what I read about them elsewhere.  All I know about Rufo is what Zman has discussed here.  And as far as UT dropping DEI, my understanding was that was now required by state law, broadly supported by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (much more pro-White than phony Abbott)  – I don’t know that the law can be attributed to Rufo’s influence.I understand your point that we live in a multiracial society, and you list various ways of best accommodating it to Whites’ needs.  Here I can only say that I can back no accommodation – it will mean the extinction of White people.  How or when or even if multiracial societies can be destroyed – I don’t know, but I will never, ever consider any version of diversity workable or good.  I vehemently oppose “pure merit” within so-called diversity.  Only within a homogeneous White society.  I don’t care how smart or capable a particular Asian may be – let him get educated and succeed in his own nation amongst his own people.I am aware of both Marechal and Zemmour in France – and I would argue that Jewish Zemmour is motivated by anti-Muslim animus far more than any legitimate French patriotism.And Singapore (where I spent 2 years) is in no way a “color-blind” society.  The Han are firmly in control of every institution and regulate who and how many others they allow in – and on what terms.  And that is perfectly fine – it’s their city-state.   Malaysians (definitely 2nd class citizens in practice) have their own and much larger country where they explicitly favor their own – Bumiputera.  The Indians in Singapore are at the bottom of the totem pole – hired mostly as unarmed ‘security guards’ and for manual labor.I will agree that marriage – as currently practiced in Western societies – is a highly personal institution.  It ought not be so – any legitimate state has an interest in marriage as the fundamental building block of any civilized society.  That’s precisely why the feminists and leftists and non-Whites have attacked it so viciously for so long.  The state ought to both encourage and reward stable unions – and since in my view a legitimate state will prioritize its own people, it will strongly discourage or outright ban miscegenation.  Yes, such unions can occasionally work, but I’ve known many of them and I would argue the dynamics are not normal and healthy in any Western sense.

Agree 100%.  Moreover, marriage is a public act and demands public recognition, therefore the public has every right to set parameters of what it will publicly recognize.  If you want to playhouse on your own, fine.  If you want to force everyone else to play along, then everyone else gets a say.

            Z pushes the “losers lose becaues they are stupid and play by the winners’ rules” bit.  Which is a great bit, because it happens to be true.But you see that he only applies this to moral claims surrounding blacks.In other words, he only punches down. Which is, as he has pointed out ad nauseum, right out of the Ben Shapiro playbook.  It is also, as I and others have pointed out, Jared Taylor’s MO as well.When it comes to Jews, Z slaps on a midwit cap and reinforces regime morality: he wants you to know he is not an “anti-semite” and attacks “anti-semites” because they are rude and socially disagreeable.So explicitly identifying an enemy who is destroying your society is wrong because it is bad manners, see?I’ve never heard a logical explanation for this self-defeating behavior.  My sense is, if there is one, it is as tortured as Greg Johnson’s rationale for being pro-Ukraine.

            I have no problem with Rufo. He’s useful to my cause, but we aren’t on the same side. That’s fine. That’s the beauty of knowing who your people are. You can ally with other groups who might benefit your groups, but both sides understand the arrangement.
People like him move the ball in the general direction that we want it to go, but they want to take it in a different direction down the road. That’s okay. We part ways at that point.

            Fair enough and all to the good. However, it does nothing to vitiate Z’s point that neither of those guys, in the long term, are on our side. But, yes, to the extent Rufo is a thorn in the Left’s side and manages to win a few battles, functionally if not philosophically, for whites, I’ll raise my flagon of ale to the man.

        While the X exchange was fun to watch, it really had “Ben Shapiro DESTORYS another brain dead Marxist 20 year old at local community college” vibes.Nothing changes, nothing happens.Clever arguments by Rufo don’t do anything.The left may concede your carefully argued point, then proceed to smash you in the mouth, burn down your business, take away your bank account, shut down your internet access, and make you toxic to be seen with.Then the right will point out this was “wrong”.  Ad infinitum. Sigh.I’d put my money on Mark “Chabenisky” Cuban.  His grandfather was smart enought to read the room and insert himself seamlessly into the local customs, not try to fight for anything.He’s a billionaire and he knows who he’s supposed to fluff in public.

        “Rufo thinks using race to make decisions is immoral, while Cuban thinks whites use race to make decisions, which is bad.”
An example of “false dichotomy.” An old trick in demagoguery and fallacious reasoning. And this particular false dichotomy means excluding the stance that differences between races are real and that making judgements and decisions on this basis is wrong.

            Arshad Ali:  But the basic issue, as Zman notes, is even more fundamental than that.  Does one have a right to one’s own preferences, for any reason at all?  Even if a particular non-White is genuinely qualified, it’s perfectly legitimate to not wish to hire him because of the automatic limits it will place on workplace conversations and cooperation.  It’s also perfectly legitimate to not wish to hire him for any reason at all – simply because that is one’s preference and prerogative.When I was interviewing people to replace me when I returned to grad school (for my second MS that I did not ever complete!), my Korean boss specifically told me he didn’t want to work with any blacks.  This was essentially a two-man office, and I understood and complied with his preference.  There was one African man, who claimed to have a PhD, who applied rather aggressively, and he immediately accused me/the office of racism when I called to say we had filled the position with someone else.  I was a White American female hired as a “secretary/executive assistant,”  so my Korean boss felt comfortable asking me questions, and utilizing my research and writing as his own.  There was no way that sort of partnership would have worked with a black man.

                    My wife works at a libertarian think tank of sorts that, believe it or not, is housed by a university. This organization dispenses fellowships for which they receive numerous applicants. Recently, they gave one of these fellowships to an applicant from Malawi. His application packet was suitably impressive. Once he arrived, however, it was discovered that he was literally too stupid to perform the function of alphabetization. He’s no longer with the program. But, being libertarians, they won’t learn the proper lesson and subject future sub-Saharan applicants to extra-strict scrutiny.

        There’s a third side, or perhaps a second wing to Rufo’s side: the Sailer/Murray (SM) wing.SM acknowledge genetic racial differences but fall back to colorblindness. Yes, there will be more Asian engineers per capita than blacks due to differing group IQs, but any individual Asian or black could fall on the left or right side of the bell curve so you must to treat everyone as an individual.However, as subversive as SM seem on first glance, they still fully accept the moral framework of our ruling class. Both Sailer and Murray are firmly against freedom of association, especially for whites. Sailer and Murry understand that whites joining the identity politics game or, worse, truly embracing freedom of association is the deathknell of the current order.If you’ve ever wondered why Sailer and Murray are allowed to continue operating despite seemingly heretical, this is why. They are morally in lockstep the ruling class.

            One reason I drifted away from the HBD scene is most of them refuse to consider the implications of what they are saying. In this regards, their hysterical critics are correct about biological reality. Once you accept that evolution is real and genetics are real, you have to accept that sex is real, race is real and ethnicity is really. At that point the progressive project explodes. People assume that guys like Sailer and Murray see it too, but are are afraid to make that next step, but I am not so sure they do see it. There is a myopia there that is not intensional.

                Sailer and Murray fall back into individualism. They are true believers in colorblind civic nationalism.The irony of CivNat dream team is that while they accept differences in group IQ and other behavioral characteristics, they simultaneously refuse to accept that those genetic differences might extend into political beliefs or societal norms.It comes back to your debate with Anton about natural rights.Sailer and Murray are no different than liberal whites who might reluctantly accept that there may be group genetic differences in athletic ability or skin color or height or bone structure, but then insist that the brain is somehow exempt.  Sailer and Murry do the same thing with race and political/societal views.

                    I have not thought about HBD Chick in years. She is a kook. I wrote a post many years ago about an event in Ireland and embedded a pic I found online that was supposedly from the event in question. It turned out that she had posted the pic on Twitter and it got circulated around the internet as often happens. Before long she was peppering me on Twitter to take down the pic. Then other harpies joined in on the action.

                    pyrrhus:  I used to skim HBD Chick’s blog, but I deliberately avoided JayMan.  I know, I’ve said before someone can be ‘x’ and also correct, but I just couldn’t do it.  He is, I believe, married to a White, which I find totally out of bounds.  Plus my government work experience in Jamaica left me with less than charitable feelings towards the denizens of that benighted island.

                        HBD had an annoying practice of disregarding the capitalization rules of standard written English. Some people don’t realize that these rules exist for a reason, and that when they are not followed it makes text difficult to read.

I remember only one direct slight/response from Z-man to ID—that of accusing him of having basically a rudimentary, freshman, understanding of the topic at large.  For a man of ID’s ego, this must have been crushing.

                        Citizen of a Silly Country: “Of course, he’s insane, so there’s that.”Oh, glad I’m not the only one who noticed. And I mean insane literally. Found out one day when I got into an exchange with him on the old Audacious Epigone blog when it was at Unz.He started saying really crazy things, such as (in the context of a discussion on the agricultural revolution and maybe the industrial revolution — it’s been a while) it is impossible to build a machine that saves labor because the design, construction, support and maintenance of the machine will always require more labor than the machine saves. And I’m trying to be as fair to his “argument” as possible.Turns out, we’d be just as well off banging a couple rocks together and poking things with pointy sticks. Who knew?

                    Yanking Steve’s chain and, really, the vast majority of his readers is a guilty pleasure of mine.I have to say that his comments board is getting more and more narrow. It’s a good sign that people have moved on.Sailer is an (inadvertent, I think) gatekeeper. It’s always easy to tell. A gatekeeper will always be against whites having the choice to identify as a group, i.e., true freedom of association.Now, they’ll couch it in being against anyone identifying as part of a racial group and organizing to protect and promote that group, but they’ll give a pass to other races but not whites. Never whites.It’s easy test to apply. Sailer, Murray, Rufo, all of them always fail. Doesn’t make them the enemy, but they aren’t allies either.

                        Citizen: Spot on as usual.  The utility of someone (to the dissident right cause) ultimately boils down to one question – which I believe you, yourself, first posed thusly:  Who are your people?  Anyone – no matter how kind, likeable, or erudite – who cannot unequivocally reply “White” is not an ally.Mixed marriages and mixed-race children are also dead giveaways.  No, I’m not personally attacking Derbyshire’s wife – I’m sure she’s perfectly nice – but he’s always made a point of promoting Western Civilization without making it explicit that such would not exist without White people.  He has to make this distinction, because of his children’s mixed heritage.

            I’ve never really read much Sailer, perhaps something at Taki’s many moons ago, but can’t recall what it was. My understanding however, is that he harps endlessly on about ‘IQ’ and ‘statisticks’ until it becomes rather tiresome.I find the old trope about ‘smart Asians’ highly amusing. As if IQ is the guarantee of life success and scientific and engineering ingenuity. My thought has always been: “If you boys were so smart, how come Europe industrialised?”.I’m told that there were many sophisticated thinkers and the like in Asiatic society. That’s fair enough, but a huge gulf appears between European civilization (for want of a better term) and the rest of the world. All the men involved in this this rapid technological progress, in the early years, had high motivation and tackled problems without any framework to guide them; consider John Harrison, for example.Far more ingenuity there than in modern academics who have been through the framework of school + college + PhD, or whatever. People like to say it was ‘low-hanging fruit’ in the old days. Right! Go back and tell that to Isaac Newton and Leibniz! To build a new field from nothing requires incredible mental tenacity, focus, creativity as well as intelligence.

And no, it wasn’t just the Usual Suspects who led us astray.There’s something possibly cancerous at the core of Western Civ — and I’m pretty sure it comes with the whole Faustian Man type territory.We’re all very good on the You-know-whos lacking self-awareness, but this seems to be our Achilles Heel.It might just be that the East Asians make it to the stars on our shoulders because they have just a bit less of our brilliance/psychosis and a bit more of the pragmatism not to be side-tracked into designing the perfect gender-neutral hyperdrive.I’ll get downvoted for this, of course. We need confidence in ourselves and proper disdain for our inferiors… but still there has to be more sober thought about who we were and who we are and who we might become.

                Steve definitely likes to be a part of the punditry class, which steers him away from various topics or noticing too much.
He really has become pretty boring over the past few years. He mocks stupid opinion pieces in the MSM (similar to Shapiro dunking on college freshmen), but never asks who supports these outlets and why.
Other than that, he really loves black traffic statistics.
He just doesn’t have much to say anymore.

            If Steve got his way, he would inevitably have to enforce colorblindness on the non-whites.  Leaving aside the impossibility of forcing the chosen to be colorblind, Steve would have to impose colorblindness on the blacks, which would require a heavy hand similar to Jim Crow.  This wouldn’t mean enforcing sundown laws, but it would entail suppressing black power organizing.With a hat tip to our Silly Citizen for his analogy, this is like holding a chair over your head forever.  Maybe you could do it, but at some point you tire of the task.In closing, I try to be sympathetic to all of the whites ensnared in our current troubles.  While people like me are waiting for the miracle of white self-assertion, Steve is waiting for the miracle of non-white colorblindness.  We’re all waiting for some kind of miracle.  Reality will disclose who placed the most accurate bet on human nature.

        Mark Cuban? A lovely Name-Changer he is.There are 3 kinds of people I know who are the kind to piss down your back, then tell you that it’s raining- gaslighting Democrat Communists, Ivy League “educated” folk, and people whose religion tells them you can’t eat pig, and that you have to marry someone whose religion also tells them you can’t eat pig. But they can drink alcohol.Well, Mark Cuban hits two of those categories. And Rufo hits one of them. Who gives a flying shit about what they have to say. They’re Cloud People, and their last act on Earth should be where they’re put up against a brick wall and smoking that last cigarette..

        Americans think that if something is good, more of the same is always better. That’s a fallacy. Diversity can be good in particular instances. I always think of the example of the Navajo code-talkers during WWII. The Japanese could never crack the American ciphers because they were being sent in the Navajo language on top of the best cryptographic techniques available at that time. But our betters think in simplistic terms.What people mean when they speak of “Diversity” today is obviously causing great harm. Part of the dark triad of DEI. The U.S. is a nuclear power with mental midgets calling the shots. Lord help us.

This is the scariest thought of all. Our Commander in Chief, F’nJB has the power to launch or not to launch. To render our planet uninhabitable for humans. Let that sink in a moment. Should he stumble a bit, no worries, his VP can take command.

                    Zoar, I’d agree.  Really, do people think the President can simply pick up the phone or type in a code and away the missiles fly?  Not a chance.  Never was, never can be.  The military sets the targets, prepares the weapons, and so forth.  Much discussion/planning precedes such.  It’s only at the end, that the President signals through the “football” that this plan goes hot.  How does a demented old man even begin to convince the joint chiefs to plan such an attack?That being said, there are a lot of slimeballs in the back ground that probably can get the ball rolling.

                The most recent book on the subject “Nuclear War, a Scenario”suggests that yes, the president does have this capability.Worse: if it’s an inbound ICBM, he has roughly six minutes to make the decision on how to respond. That’s in a best case scenario.He can delegate this authority, but even that takes time.The “reestablish deterrence” protocols after a one off icbm from, say, North Korea require a mass response, overwhelmingly punishing nuclear response.Which, because our ICBMs have to fly over Russia, whose satellites aren’t that great, will probably mean they launch.Game over.Nuclear war isn’t a war crime, it isn’t genocide, it’s an extinction level event.  Any politician caught saber rattling with these is criminally insane.

            It’s funny that DEI is the genitive form of deus (2nd declension) given the cultish passion of some congregants. Priests and deacons, however, understand the cult’s project as

        Despite appearing to be opposites, both sides are making the same moral claims with regards to race.Heh. Isn’t this always the way? One person seems like he may be talking sense; but in the end, both would have you jailed for suggesting that blacks cannot function well in white societies. Or perhaps some other utterance that contradicts what they believe to be true.The simple fact, I believe, is that both of these people recognise the reality of race; I mean, this ‘Twitter exchange’ wouldn’t have happened without race being a thing that people have an opinion on. They just have tepid and contradictory views on the subject.My own view, from my personal life experience as well as reading is that, whilst modern whites have a heap of problems, I can findat least somewho will share my feelings. However, no matter how hard I may try, nor how nice one appears to be; my consideration is that a black fellow will tribe up when he has to… at my expense.

            So will any ethnicity except us brainwashed Whiteys.I was living in Macau back when a busload of Hong Kong Chinese tourists got shot up during a hijack in Manila. Things made worse by the typically bungled typically baked-in-comes-with-the-genes clownish Filipino SWAT team which probably did most of the damage. For the next week or so, no bus driver would stop for anyone Brown-looking. So all the Filipino and Indonesian maids had to walk.It wasn’t just ethnic solidarity, there was Han open contempt for the incompetent stupidity of an inferior race.This is the Way. Not nice. Not kind. Not even ‘fair’. But this is the Way.

        All opinions.Ah, the blogger’s attention finally cirlces around to this Mark Chabenisky, aka Mark Cuban. They have not scrubbed his early life, but at least his father apparently made an honest living.This clownworld princeling is easily examined if one spends 30 seconds.“Cuban Hops into Bed with Girls Gone Wild”https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/weird/cuban-hops-into-bed-with-girls-gone-wild/2117403/“Mark Cuban’s HDNet television network is teaming up with “Girls Gone Wild” to produce a reality show to find the hottest girl in America.Yes, this Girls Gone Wild is the same brand that is known for lewd DVDs of young women exposing themselves on camera.”And:“‘Girls Gone Wild’s’ Joe Francis Guilty of Assault, False Imprisonment”https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/celebrity-justice/girls-gone-wilds-joe-francis-guilty-of-assault-false-imprisonment/This Chabenisky stood erect, as he, in full salivated over the opportunity to become the king of cable softcore pornography. Was he aware that the felon Francis made bank on possibly date-rape drugging, or otherwise exploiting intoxicated young women then monentizing their acts? Sure, say these women ‘deserved it’ if you will until you have daughters.This Chabenisky is a monster. He enriched himself using what I surmise was insider information to get his payday before the phony dotcom bubble burst.No discussion should avoid the facts of what this Chabenisky is. a gross, caricature.

        For many years, the people in charge and their minions seemed to put a lot of energy into formally ignoring us. They’d invite the antiracists who advocated strenuously for restorative justice, and they’d invite the colorblind hustlers like Rufo to argue the opposite position. They knew we monsters who didn’t care one way or the other dwelled beyond the castle walls—and some of us were even daywalkers who kept quiet within the walls—but the game was to ignore us.Being ignored can be annoying, but I actually kind of miss those days. Now, we seem to be all they really talk about or think about. They want to take battering rams to the doors of our homes just to make sure we’re not having fun or laughing at off-color jokes. I think they also know we’re laughing at them, which they really can’t stand. Like Bill Maher or Jon Stewart, they want to believe comedy belongs to them, that they’re still the cool kids, not the butt of the joke. The Alt Right failed spectacularly in many ways, but the memeing really pissed them off.And somewhere beyond the parapets are these phantom armies of Q Anon Shamans and Boogaloo Boys in tactical gear planning the great white insurgency, or something.I think they fear—rightly—that all the doxing and cancelling and craziness has driven a large enough smart fraction of talented white guys into other spaces. They’ve banished enough of us to create a genuine counterculture, with their campaign of ostracism actually working as a selection pressure in our favor. I personally didn’t get “doxed” or “cancelled,” but just withdrew when the waterline of craziness moved up above the mouth and into the nostrils. I’m not the only one. I only hope that not too many were lured overseas—especially to China—or expatriated to Mexico. We need a community of internal exiles who can still engage with the system on the margins, monkeywrenching and culture jamming them.I endured the system long enough to get my advanced degree, and I have my talents and some money. I just share those things with other people like myself, people who don’t hate me and who reinforce my assistance with their own collaboration.I will say, though, it’s amusing that Cuban claims to be in favor of diversity. Ever seen how monochromatic (or rather, how nasally similar) all the management and ownership of the NBA is? I guess the only reason they didn’t get their ranks purged like those in Hollywood during MeToo is that it’s probably harder to rape a 7’ 5’’ black guy than it is some little blond shicksa looking for her big break.

        Mark Cuban is a billionaire because he got lucky and sold broacast.com to Yahoo shortly before the dot com bubble burst.  His net worth hasn’t really increased that much since then.  Still it is a condemnation of our education system that he doesn’t know the basics about the government.  I doubt you can even blame it on his public school education, his prep school peers wouldn’t be any better.

            Cuban hit the lottery. He was clever, for sure, but Yahoo coming in to buy what turned out to be a worthless company is what got him from being a shady millionaire in the suburbs to billionaire status. In reality, his net worth has actually declined since he hit the lottery. This is in absolute and inflation adjusted figures. In fact, he would be worth three times what he is worth now if he had just put his lottery winnings into an S&amp;P 500 fund. This is despite owning a sprots team, which always rises in value.

        Rufo has an Asian wife, so of course he’s not going to be doing white advocacy when his children are mixed race. This is also something people used to understand. Some outbreeding is beneficial to a group, but the cosmopolitans that marry outside their tribe still have to be kept at arm’s length, as their core loyalties are conflicted. It’s another obvious truth that we have to pretend doesn’t exist because it sounds mean.

            I think you can do white advocacy even if you’re mixed-race or nonwhite.
The problem comes when you’re advocating for racial purity. Folks obsessed with that should probably decide who is white or isn’t white enough, and then marry in-race.

            One of the stranger parts with Cuban is that he spends a lot of time around NBA players who on average are not just dumb, but the dumbest pro athletes.  It is impossible he doesn’t notice even with his average level of intelligence.  Maybe it is just coincidence, but his star players tend to be white Europeans.  Perhaps he is overcompensating a bit in an effort to not have blacks make too big a deal out of that.

                Cuban is a typical Jew. He loves being around basketball and blacks. (Also like a typical Jew, he doesn’t want to live around blacks.)
He’s basically just a lucky billionaire version of the Adam Sandler character in Uncut Gems.

                As a former college basketball and baseball player at a small state commuter school, I can back up that assertion. Our hoops program had more tutors than we did coaches and other on-court and off-court support staff. Why is that?Because most of my teammates read on a 3rd grade reading level and had to have their classwork done for them so they could remain eligible.They would also get in trouble in the most idiotic ways outside of the classroom, making my coach’s job that of herding cats. One teammate was arrested after he had an accidental discharge in a restaurant with his illegal pistol that wounded him in the thigh. Another got busted at a roadblock smoking a giant blunt and carrying enough weed to make Cheech and Chong blanche.That idiocy extended on the court as well, as most of them were skilled athletes who could run and jump with the best of them, but were often embarrassed by players (many white, many of them Eastern European) with higher basketball IQs.When I told my coach I wanted to double-major in two engineering disciplines, he balked and asked me if I’d rather pursue an easier major. When I told him my SAT score and reminded him that I was a multi-year member of my high school’s math team, he shut up.In baseball, where I was a relief pitcher, we had no such issues and most baseball players don’t receive a full athletic scholarship anyway due to arcane rules. Most of our guys had academic rides and deservedly so. Even the black guys who played baseball came from stable families and were in the talented tenth.

                    Wife picked up a tutoring job for the athletic department when we were graduate students.

She was given *one* instruction from the athletic department.  She was to meet with a particular assistant coach *outside* of the classroom (in the athletic center complex).She and the assistant coach would then enter the classroom and begin the session.  She was told under no circumstance to enter the classroom or begin the tutorial session early or without the assistant coach’s presence!Even the athletic department knew what animals they had for players.  We were naive in those years, but no more.
