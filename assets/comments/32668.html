        Unfortunately, the US and its foreign rulers simply aren’t built to fade away. We are a naval power ruled by a middle-man people. Our entire reason for existence is to meddle in world affairs. China, Russia, Iran and others simply want to be left alone. That won’t happen.
The West’s morality can’t allow competing moralities. In addition, the West’s rulers are not builders or leaders, but schemers and financiers. To be excluded is death for them and never tolerated. But our morality and the nature of our rulers can’t let the world live in peace.

            Reality will have the last word. No, they aren’t built that way, but the fade part has slipped from their hands. It doesn’t mean they won’t continue to be a major part of the world, but “part” is the key word. Events, some self-inflicted, others not, are making way for other moralities.

                No, our rulers can’t stop what’s happening. It’s just a question of how much trouble they cause as reality slowly wins.
We can no longer intimidate the big countries with our economy or military. All that the US has left is the global financial system and the dollar. That’s the last battle of this war.

                    Yeah, and the issue is if a nuclear exchange is a part of that trouble. We are closer to a nuclear war than anytime since Able Archer 83 and possibly closer this time. The Reagan people at least had the sense to back off once they realized what was going down. Our current people are a bunch of oblivious clowns.

                        Yeah, but nothing has happened thus far. Therefore continual escalation on our part is perfectly safe and carries no risk whatsoever of retaliation, nuclear or otherwise.
This idiocy absolutely pervades the ruling elite’s thinking on the war.

            So now I give Ned Beatty’s speech in “Network” about the recycling function of the Global Financial System. Our Overlords here surely must understand, as I know you do, that if we’re going to run perpetual trade and budget deficits, somebody has to run perpetual surpluses to finance us. Otherwise the system breaks down. At that point, morality etc. will be a sideshow. The Dollar is their ultimate Morality.

                It’s going to take a while to find an alternative or alternatives to the dollar. There’s really no replacement at the moment. But the world is working on it. Eventually, alternative systems will be created. No one wants to live under their rule anymore.

                            When/if this happens, we will be impoverished overnight.  The US runs 80 billion a month trade deficits.  Probably a lot of our exports rely on the Dollar anyway, so it could be much larger without the Dollar.

                I suspect, missiles coming into European military centers as a reprisal.  Tit for tat, so to speak.  This would be a wake up call to complacent NATO allies.  The world would recognize this as a just response.

                Won’t happen. People underestimate how important it is that the tribe looks like Europeans. Heck, genetically, they are partially. The Chinese are very ethnocentric. They’re never going to fall for the “My fellow Chinese . . .” act.
The tribe is so cocky that it hasn’t realized that it can’t take its show on the road outside of Europe and, maybe, the Middle East. (Even in the Middle East, the religion thing will keep them in check.)

                    Exactly.  As a collective, they can only run empires for 70-80 years before a collapse. China was the next place, something that showed up by the 1990’s. However,  Mark Zuckerberg’s mixed race baby lack of an official Chinese name from the Emporor, er President Xi is excellent symbol of what is going on in China.The complete disaster of the Cultural Revolution probably gave the Chinese awareness of the tribe’s incoherency and danger as “helpers”.Much of Clown World’s current chaos can be traced to what appears to be an aborted attempt to move an empire to China. They are overdue to abandon the US, but can’t make it a go of either moving or recovering American strength.

                    People underestimate how important it is that the tribe looks like Europeans.Threat recognition is genomically hardwired into our ‘hindbrain’. All animals have behavior prediction subroutines that continuously operate and trigger physiological and cognitive responses (like suspicion, fear, fight, flight) when thresholds are crossed.When there is a threat that doesn’t trigger autonomic threat assessment (because camouflage, a deception that subverts normal self preservation behaviors) then at least in the human animal the result is stress and fear resulting in a lowered chance of dealing with threat without violence. It wasn’t just punitive when the Germans made Jews wear the yellow stars. They looked like Germans, but inside their heads they were not Germans (different mores).Perhaps that Europeans look like Jews makes the rest of humanity, when dealing with us, similarly distressed because most can’t tell us from them. Maybe we should all wear blue stars (or some other symbol like a greatsword) symbolizing that we are neither Jews nor willing participants in their transnational empire.

                        This will be an unpopular thought: The current tribe blends in with Europeans because genetically, most of them are European descent.That is the reality of thing, no matter what they tell themselves or even others believe of it.That said, they don’t believe they are Europeans, so that becomes the point everyone must deal with.

                            Their genomes have been mapped. The Ashkenazi are hybrids (~half European and ~half other), like Mexicans (Asian with European admixture) and Americanized Africans (African with European admixture). That they have a lot more European sequence than they do sequence that can remotely be traced to the ancient Hebrews is yet another for both their self hatred and their hatred of us.
The Sephardi and Mizrahi, on the other hand, are basically the same as the gentile North African and Middle Eastern populations from which originate.

                    If I recall, Germany had a terrific submarine force in both world wars.
It is  kind of hard to ship cargo or invade France with a submarine fleet.
And it’s hard to impress the natives by showing up outside the harbor in a submarine.

                        The German sub fleet was indeed advanced, but perhaps more so large at the start of the war.  However, the advancement in antisubmarine warfare outmatched the German sub fleet very quickly.First, we reverted to the WWI tactic of “convoy”.  That reduced sub losses tremendously. Then of course sonar and airplane surveillancecame about, further making trips out of port dangerous.1942 was the last year that sub loses exceeded the new shipping builds of the Allies.By 1943, Germany lost more sub’s than it produced. In 1944 they recalled all subs to port and to close shore duty, rather than convoy intercept.The German submarine threat had been defeated.  So much so that even from bases *in* France, German sub’s could not disrupt the invasion.

GAE can still pack a punch. I’m not saying that. I’m saying that other countries can now punch back just as hard. China doesn’t want to invade the US. They just want the US out of their region or, at least, for the US to stop telling them what to do in their region.
The US isn’t willing to trade punches for Taiwan or Ukraine or Iran. We’re moving back to a regional power.

            Yep…but the problem with naval powers has always been technological advances that either make your navy unusable for its main purposes, or render it irrelevant…Here that development is hypersonic missiles and cheap drones, against which there is no defense, which can easily destroy $20 billion carriers (counting the cost of the crew) at little cost to the attacker…e.g.Cheap Houthi drones set the Eisenhower’s deck on fire…So most of the West’s extremely costly firepower has been negated…That leaves the nukes, which retaliation for which would see DC and London destroyed within minutes…

                            What lid?  I remember hearing about the anomalies of the attack pretty much within the same year—actually within months.  What has continued to drop out are repeated analyses and a bit more theory on the reasons why the attack. Certainly sailors were not kept quiet for 13 years.

                The handwriting was on the wall as early as 1982, when an Exocet missile from a third-world power sunk a UK warship (The Falklands “War”). That was 42 years ago, several lifetimes in terms of how technology changes. Further, I assume (but don’t know) that France didn’t sell its most sophisticated gear to Argentina.Nowadays, as already mentioned, a small flock of cheap drones, perhaps with some ballistic missiles thrown in, present a credible threat even to an Aircraft carrier equipped with the latest (and very expensive) countermeasures. If you’re sailing a defenseless civilian ship, well…Sure, that wunderwaffen can knock down an incoming threat; the only problem is each round costs $1 million or whatever and they only have a handful. It shouldn’t require a DoD procurement specialist to know that the math rapidly turns bad if goat fuckers in a desert a hundred miles away can launch ten or a hundred projectiles at you for less than the cost of one of your countermeasures.

        Mearsheimer and others have noted that the US is an Air and Sea power, not a land power, and it never has been.
The US, still drunk on it’s success over the sand peoples 20 years ago, seems to not realize that sea power is worthless in Russia and air power only works if you’re willing to bomb a country that spans 13 time zones.
Not to mention, nukes.
The narrative that the US is some kind of unstoppable giant is crumbling, but the people in charge of it are going to be the last who acknowledge it.

                Desert Storm was a walk in the sandbox, back when serious people were in charge. Not only did America go in with overwhelming force, but started by securing the approval of 195 out of 198 nations – China being one of the sole dissenters. That way, nobody noticed that GHW Bush had no Security Council resolution and that the war was technically illegal.
So how old do you feel if you can remember when the SC was a big deal?

                    Desert Storm was a success because we had the approval of much of the world and the Iraqi army essentially chose not to fight. They generally surrendered in mass. Very few of our troops actually saw combat. It was a four day march across the desert for the vast majority of them.
The good will we had with Desert Storm and 9/11 was squandered by the Bush II administration with its perpetual war for perpetual peace.

Dead Men have done all kinds of things.
Not a full-on Gibbon-thesis follower, so I wouldn’t swear by Origen’s Balls that a dead Jew took down the Western Roman Empire. It was ‘Complicated’. But yet…
You might also like to have a word with Constantine XI Palaiologos should you happen to attend a séance. Eastern Roman Empire got taken out by a Dead Arab. Sorta kinda… again.
Dead Men have been known to tell some pretty compelling tales.

            Not arguing with the US being a sea and air power, but it’s crazy that we’re the 3rd largest country by area in spite of it.
Also crazy how much area the ‘British’ Empire controlled, especially that they beat traditional land power France in N. America.

                During the colonial wars in North America, the French were limited by not having a large local population base to aid them. The British had the 13 colonies, plus the (future) Canadian Maritimes to aid them.Today’s Russian situation reminds one of the Conan movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing Conan, starts smashing mirrors in the monster room to defeat the beast. Today’s Conan is a Harvard-educated bureaucrat in Washington who is smashing his own illusions to kill the beast that is Putin.One of the casualties of illusion-loss is the sense that Russia is a fragile nation-state. It is not. The Russians can tolerate a higher degree of social incohesion and anarchy than most states, and this looks (mistakenly) like weakness. Only an insider would have predicted the rise of the Communists in the Russian Revolution. Only an insider would guess that the former Russian Empire would convert into a Soviet Union that would go on to challenge the world.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

                It has been argued that in early 1865 the US had the largest and best-equipped army in the world. It was certainly a “land power”, though its only function was to destroy fellow countrymen in the South, and was scrapped quickly thereafter.Point being, land powers emerge because they share land borders with potential enemies; since 1865 the enemies of the US happen to be thousands of miles away, on the other side of these things we call oceans. Given the difficulty of marching huge armies over water, it’s pretty obvious that air and sea power would loom large in US military thinking. Kind of a geography thing.

”Yes, Ulysses S. Grant did make a veiled threat regarding the potential invasion of Canada during a diplomatic dispute with England over the “Alabama Claims.” These claims arose after the American Civil War when the U.S. demanded reparations from Britain for the damage caused by Confederate warships built in British shipyards, particularly the CSS Alabama, which had inflicted significant losses on Union merchant ships.….”

        One of the moderators on the clown show yesterday tried to gum up Trump with a “Do you want Ukraine to win?” question. He deftly dodged it, because he’s Trump and has dealt with this nonsense his whole life, but it shows the myopia of the ruling class. A sensible person knows peoples have various interests that need to be recognized. Even if you don’t recognize the interest as valid, it doesn’t automatically mean they are evil.Trump understands this, because he’s done negotiations with people ranging from honest to outright sleazeballs his entire life, and knows what is and isn’t feasible. Tut-tutting doesn’t do anything if you don’t have the capability of backing up your scolding, and sometimes you have to deal with what you have with a bad actor. Our guys in Washington are incapable of framing issues this way, and hence where we are now.

            Well, if Trump “aced” that question, he fell for any number of obvious “traps”. Trump gave Kamala a victory in the debate as he fell for any number of other “gotcha” questions. The first mistake he made was allowing his responses to be “fact checked” by the moderators. He surely did not read Z-man in that respect. Trump just can’t help himself.So the debate rules cut off the other debater’s mic—only to have the ABC (know nothing) moderator override a Trump reply with a “fact check” pulled out of said moderators ass. Interesting that all these “fact checks” were already in the hopper waiting for Trump to give them an opening to be expressed.Clue to Trump, the debate is not, and never was about facts—it’s about “optics”. Trump supporters will remain Trump supporters, Harris supports will remain Harris supporters, but if there were any true undecideds, they’ll break for Harris. This may just be enough to send Trump packing…

                The “fact check” stuff was outrageous, as was the softballs they lobbed at Kamala along the lines of “is your opponent just a regular monster, or history’s greatest monster?”. This is especially interesting because the CNN moderators were actually pretty reasonable and fair, and they got destroyed by Democrats because of that. As for Kamala winning, I’ve been watching these things for a long time and the media always gives the Democrat the win. The only time they don’t is when it would just be ridiculous to claim otherwise, like recently or when Obama debated Romney.  As long as the Democrat is somewhat sentient, he or she always gets the win.But, it doesn’t matter. These are the rules of the road, and Trump knows it.

            I found Trump’s answers to these questions to be beyond dodging and quite excellent, because it shows a care for this nation, this world, and the people in it that is simpy lost on the evil Washington establishment, as now embodied by Kamala Harris who proudly accepted and bragged about the endorsement of the war criminal Dick Cheney.Trump said, put simply, he wants the war to end, because millions of people have died needlessly and we are getting pushed into a nuclear World War III that will kill us all if allowed to continue. To me, this answer might have, more than any other, demarcated the difference between Trump and the rest, and outlined why they hate him. If anything, it proved Trump, for all his bluster and bravado, to be a serious person as compared to the people who now rule over us.

                Trump tried to make nuclear non-proliferation a household issue back in the early 80s but the media just treated it as a joke, a passing fancy of an idle princeling rather than a serious concern highlighted by a serious citizen and patriot.

        As I have said, the Russians are fighting a 21st century version of kabinetskreig, which none of these retards in the Kagan cult have ever even considered, since the United States has never fought one. One would think that Western Europeans would get it, having actually fought 18th century cabinet wars but since they are now ruled by menopausal women or limp wristed men, they don’t see the blindingly obvious either.

        For sure war is an extension of politics, but wars also have a dramatic feedback loop that changes the politics of the participants. The longer is the war, the bigger the changes.The Neocons in charge just ignore this feedback loop. But a quick world tour shows the Taliban in charge in Afg., nobody in charge in Libya, Assad still in Syria and the Iranians de facto in control of Iraq.And yet they still think Putin is leaving? Who would come next? And now we are conducting economic warfare against China. Whatever, but China isn’t going away. Meanwhile, China now cannot let the Russians lose because it’s a matter of their prestige. There is just no second-order thinking and eventually this is going to screw us.

And speaking of WW2, it is curious that globohomo has given itself a reputation very close to what the normative narrative have Hitler when it comes to keeping one’s word and honoring agreements. “Not one inch east” is probably very close to “my final territorial demand” ib Russian.

                    I agree that it’s the standard narrative. I’m just saying it is wrong.  The British government and the press hid Hitler’s proposed solution to the Danzig problem because of how “moderate and reasonable” it was and how unreasonable Poland was being.
I have plenty of criticisms for Hitler and the National Socialist government.  But the idea that Hitler was just bound and determined to make war for territory is laughable.
Just fyi, my comment was not a criticism of you.

                            France was in on it too at various times.  But the specific time I’m referring to with Danzig is in late August 1939 (the invasion was postponed multiple times), they were communiques with Britain and her diplomats.  America was not involved in any way.  It was France and Britain that offered the war guarantees, not the US.It was the 16 point plan offered by the NS government.  Everyone who saw it was shocked at the reasonableness of it.The Poles were massacring Germans.  The Poles refused to even negotiate.  Neither Britain or France had any interests in the place.  The warmongers wanted their war.You can argue all you want that Hitler was a madman trying to light the world on fire.  But he simply wasn’t. You’ve been bombarded with propaganda your entire life and refuse to believe anything else.  Hitler wanted more than anything to be partners with the British, not to go to war with them.  The British government could have stopped the war at this time by withdrawing their war guarantee.  Not only was in not in Britain’s interest, they had absolutely no way to protect Poland and they knew it.  But after years of warmongering, they finally got their war.I have criticism here of Hitler and the NSDAP as well. Hitler could have handled the crisis much better and avoided an unwinnable war.  He knew earlier in 39 that Churchill and the other warmongers had Chamberlain over a barrel and there was no chance of Britain helping to resolve the crisis.

                                ”America was not involved…”
Not true, Roosevelt was pulling the strings behind the scenes. The British guarantee was not intended to protect Poland but its true purpose was to give Britain a pretext to declare war on Germany.  Once this war was started, (((they))) were never going to allow Chamberlin to call it off.
Also, Churchill, in 1939, knew that America would enter the war on Britain’s side.
Churchill danced with the American devil(FDR) and had his British Empire eaten alive.

                            We get into the bad habit of assuming that there must be a good guy in a conflict. Hitler obviously had ambitions for a German empire. The British obviously had ambitions to keep their empire or at least their dominance and “We’re the bestest people in the world” self bestowed title. FDR was clearly gunning for a fight too.It’s like there was bunch of high school kids running the world in the 1930’s.

                        Bifurcating Poland for permanent access to an Eastern German community is not a reasonable solution. The reasonable solution was to move Danzig closer to Germany, given WWII.But the Brits wanted war. And so did the Hilter. The most solid analysis can be exactly be like Murder On the Orient Express. That is, everyone was the bad guy in WWII. From the POV of the person who showed up in the early 20th wanting to live their life, they were pretty much surrounded by leaders determined to play Risk in real life. Only Franco will ultimately ever get credit for doing a good job from that vision of WWII.

                        “But the idea that Hitler was just bound and determined to make war for territory is laughable.”So his doctrine of acquiring ‘lebensraum’ for the German people was just empty talk? He wasn’t planning on making Ukraine and other eastern conquests economic colonies of the Reich?Setting Poland aside, why did Hitler conquer or otherwise absorb Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, France, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Yugoslavia? Just temporary expedients to winning a just war against those terrible, underhanded Brits?Of course blaming the Poles and the British for the German bombing of Warsaw and the strafing of fleeing civilians makes perfect sense in an upside down kind of way.Poor Hitler, so misunderstood…

            It is like WWI with nukes. Everything should be obvious and predictable but apparently is not. The only reason this has not gone nuclear so far is the patience of Putin. It is a bitter pill to swallow for those of us who lived through the Cold War and thought the good guys won rather than another set of bad guys took their place.

My greatest fear is that those behind Putin will be far less patient.
Recall, though he looks terrific, Putin himself is 77. His younger years under the Soviets were not easy. Thus, he is at risk of passing from the scene on a moment’s notice.

                    Great point. Putin’s strategy of studied patience so far has paid dividends, so maybe his successors will follow that tact. The problem remains, of course, that the GAE is led by emotionally incompetent people perfectly capable of burning the world to the ground.

                Putin has shown enormous restraint. NATO, aka the GAE, has demonstrated that it regards itself as at war with Russia, despite the fact that Ukraine is not a NATO member, and that Biden himself (remember him?) said that a “small incursion” by Russia into Ukraine could be overlooked. Putin – a serious man, for all his faults – recognizes that no one in the “West” can be negotiated with, and he may be scared that he’s dealing with lunatics with nukes. Which might explain his restraint. It’s as if they are taunting him:You go first. It’s terrifying but right now the GAE is the world’s leading and most dangerous ‘rogue state’.

                    The other mistake they made was putting too much faith in our market and financial indices and this is a good lesson for all. Just because a ruble doesn’t buy so many dollars, doesn’t mean it doesn’t buy adequate goods and services within Russia. The ruble as a practical matter hampers them when it comes to buying luxury goods such as Mercedes and BMWs, not so much when it comes to everyday food and necessities made within Russia. If you don’t need to do much trade with the US, you don’t really need dollars.

                    “Enemy” overstates it. They are mad at him.Elon’s vision of our enslavement differs slightly from theirs and requires that we be allowedsomefreedom, enough to allow for minimal technological progress. This includes letting white guys talk shit on Twitter as their race and civilization slowly pass from the earth, leaving our “recipes” behind for the ‘jeets to make rockets and the chinks to play symphonies for Elon’s descendants, rather than silencing and killing us all ASAP.In that sense he’s a visionary futurist. To his peers—all of them—our silence and death iseverything. They want to see it happen before they die themselves. They’re giving Elon swirly after swirly toget with the programbut he’s a nerd so he can’t get the message.Thiel should just tell him.

            I am not so sure. What the West can provide to Ukraine is what they already have provided, which is the ATACM’s and air launched cruise missiles like the Storm Shadow. The Russians have largely solved both when used on short range targets. They would have an easier time if Ukraine reaches for longer range targets. The target worth the risk are well beyond the range of anything the West can supply Ukraine.What Ukraine is angling for is the ability to do some PR stunts, like firing at the Crimea bridge. They may think they can take shots at the Kursk nuclear power plant, and thus try to blackmail the Russians. In both cases it is highly unlikely to work, but it could give the Russians an excuse to attack NATO command and control centers in Ukraine.The Russians took out the Swedish training center a few weeks back. It was full of NATO advisers. Everyone in the West denied the story, but the Swedes fired the guy responsible for running the Swedish training program. This was a warning to NATO. As a result, my guess is the Biden regime will let Ukraine fire missiles at some safe targets over the border or maybe at Crimea, but that is the limit.

                The same has happened to the French several times. The advisors were called “mercenaries” in the media after the deadliest hit back in January, but they were in fact active military according to the Russians. Possibly in anticipation of the recent election, Macron backed off somewhat in May/June sending French forces there. The Brits continue to have people on the ground getting killed from time to time, too. Do not discount an October surprise in the form of something similar happening to Americans then.

Seems to me they’re doing this intentionally at the direction of their masters.  You can’t look at what’s happening in the West and deduce that these people are working for the benefit of their nations/people.  It strikes me as a planned demolition. People like us who want what’s best for the West have a difficult time comprehending such audacious malevolence.

        I confess, I didn’t watch the circus last night, but I did peak at the comments from late yesterday. There wasn’t much there, but in the end, do these debates even matter?
Im pretty sure that anyone who is voting will not be swayed one way or the other.
Can you imagine the things that could be accomplished if all the political nonsense was replaced by productive thought and behavior?

Sure do. By this time next year thousands of AWFLs will have had their first [ahem] encounters with Hayshinz.
Yentas will find the Hayshinz. Their husbands or brothers will monetize the videos. Brothers and married cucks ofthe North Shoreand similar areas elsewhere will pretend not to know what’s going on. They will fight hate with love—provided that their masters haven’t gotten them nuked in the 2nd nuclear war of “our democracy”.

            Yes, they do matter—somewhat.  It’s the optics.  Harris showed she could talk and animate.  In that, she is not a demented corpse like Biden.  That’s enough for those with doubts.  Trump lost the optics.  Yes, he might win debating points, or on the facts, but that’s not what the debate was about.

            Post-debate coverage of the debate (reviews of a tv show) rationalizes changing the poll numbers, producing a “horserace” whose already written and over-telegraphed ending—remember Biden +10, the Red Mirage, “Will you pledge…” etc?—is thefinal decisionin Our Democracy.

John Mearsheimer, Doug McGregor, Jeffery Sach (yes, I know he is a lefty, but he is one of the good guys today), Ray McGovern, Larry Johnson, and many others give the current updates on both wars.

Perhaps reflecting upon his grandparents’ experience of Italians not being regarded as fully Europeans, he angrily dismisses any form of immigration patriotism as crass xenophobia. He is unable to perceive how our current demographics have led to the politics of agrievement and aggression he steadfastly opposes in his commentary.

            Agreed. Particularly McGregor who gives arealpolitikview and McGovern who understands the spook angle behind what’s happening. Ritter and Johnson tend to go with more of a morality angle, and, as most here probably agree, white man’s morality doesn’t map very well into some peoples and cultures.
White man morality applies in Ukraine because the combatants are white. But the more I hear from Palis themselves, the more I am convinced that Israel’s Gaza problem has a lot in common with Chicago’s South Side problem.

        Of course, if the USA was the sort of global hegemon/world power/partner that it thinks itself to be, there would be no countries ready or willing to break away from the unipolar world. The USA would just be so great, kind, benevolent, giving that it would be insane to spurn such a beneficial relationship in favor of the unknown. The fact that countries seem so eager to do so, or at least flirt with the option, shows just what it is like having being a vassal to the USA. It’s not great, and it’s gotten a lot worse since the USA started coming in and demanding feminism, open border, homosexuality, Holocaust museums, black lives matter, transgenderism, and whatever other social fad is percolating in DC/NY/LA/SF. It’s getting so bad that the perma-cucks and vassals in Germany and Englandare starting to get tired of it.

        The FT on Sep. 9: “Ukraine’s Kursk offensieve has dented Vladimir Putin’s war narrative and triggered ‘questions’ among the Russian elite about the point of the war, two of the world’s leading spy chiefs have said” — at the FT’s Weekend festival in London.They are CIA Director Burns and his poodle, MI6 chief Richard Moore.
“Narrative,” it’s always the “narrative,” however inane.

            The only Russian “discussion/descension” I hear about is between two factions:  One backs the slow grinding war of attrition via Putin’s “plan”, the other massive invasion and destruction ala WWII style war.
Neither seems to run in Ukraines favor.

        There also seems to be a schism within the West between those who think a worldwide empire still can be maintained and those who want to follow the lead of China and Russia and settle for regional dominance (North America/Western Europe in that case). The latter group clearly seems to have the upper hand, which in part is why the indigenous and heritage populations are being bullied into submission just as non-Westerners were before them. In other words, the GAE is downsizing and changing management policies even while deadenders want to continue as in the past. Those changes no longer include placating the Dirt people so they will fight wars for the Ruling Class and do other evil things on their behalf.The sun is setting on the neocons right along with the white populations, which the former ironically hated so much. Look for what was the West to become more oppressive, poorer, and vengeful as its glory days become a dim reflection in the rearview mirror. I’m not sold at all on a Pax Rus/Sino Pax, but Pax Americana clearly is done. The accelerated looting is Exhibit A. Within the truncated GAE itself, areas will fragment and over time central rule will become impossible. For those who think as we do, it is simultaneously a grim age yet the beginning of the end of those who always wanted us dead. The only realistic goal is to live through this and be ready to rebuild.

        Feeling salty so I think a renaming of The Cathedral to The Roach Infested Basement – TRIB. The TRIB has openly written of its designs to use Ukraine as a staging ground to destabilize Russia so that TRIB’s master’s in its golden halllways in the sky can resume its partition, stripping and using as a resource base to undergird their perpetual growth global ponzi.I don’t think there are secrets between the sides since we can go to any airport and read about their scheming. It is kind of like the way they handle TGR. They are brimming with hubris, and venomous hatred, so they openly talk about their designs to destroy our nations, our societies and our very people. It is ubiquitous. Then, when confronted it is dismissed with cries of conspiracy theory and other flippant dismissals. The dismissed burn hotter and hotter and hotter with rage.In that sense we probably have a lot more in common, a “lived experience”, if you care to cringe with me, shared with Chines, Russian and other statesmen and diplomats.

        The war has also shown that NATO military might isn’t.  None of the Western wonder weapons changed anything for Ukraine, and in many instances Russia is way ahead, like in super sonic missiles.  You would think this might give people pause as this is no longer F16s against RPGs in the Middle East, but no, the US keeps escalating, so we are now at serious risk of a direct war with a military peer (or better).

            It’d be a real shame if Russia sent one or ten of their hypersonic missiles to Kiev and incinerated certain high-level visiting dignitaries. I suspect it’s well within their power, and only some type of forbearance on their part keeps them from doing so. I don’t know the law of war, but to the extent this is a legitimate “war”, I would think such a target would be “legal.” In any event, it would for damned sure send a message, loud and clear, to the US and its minions that Russia is done fucking around.Assuming Russia has the ability which I bet they do, I’ll speculate on why they are staying their hand. Certainly, to turn the visiting US/NATO delegation into hamburger would be a ballsy move. But what would the US reaction be? It’d certainly influence the upcoming election, but how? I’m not privy to whether Moscow would be happier with a Harris or Trump 2.0.

        Another aspect of the political dimension of the Ukraine war that Vladimir Putin has to manage is the attempts of outside parties to persuade the Russians to negotiate with the Ukrainians.  The negotiating positions of the two sides are persently so far apart that there’s no point in talking, but other countries are trying to insert themselves as mediators.  China proposed a peace plan some time ago, but I think China has simply given up its efforts in light of the Kursk offensive and Ukrainian/NATO intransigence.  Victor Orban made trips to Kiev and Moscow, but that effort seems also to have fizzled.  Most recently, the Indians and Brazilians are trying to insert themselves as mediators. Putin has to humor them as much as possible, while still seeking to achieve Russia’s aims.  Humoring countries such as Brazil and India is, however, important, because Putin clearly wants their support in building a financial, economic and ultimately military bulwark against the Global American Empire; sort of a super-BRICS.  Fortunately, Putin is inherently very talented and he has the able support of the Russian diplomatic corps; Serge Lavrov is probably the best diplomat in the world today.  Tony Blinken isn’t fit to carry Lavrov’s briefcase.

            The Brazilians and Indians also have strong ties with America. The Indians are currently dumping their unwanted population into North America, wile slowly taking over certain sectors of the economy. Brazil is in America’s backyard. They see the old Third World game of getting free stuff from Washington by flirting with the enemies of Washington.Russia and China both imagine a post-America world. I am not sure the Indians are there yet. Brazil is not. The Saudis may be. Even so, we are a long way from the multipolar world, so Russia has to manage the Ukraine war in that context.

                “I am not sure the Indians are there yet. Brazil is not. The Saudis may be.”
Everyone sees this. Even the Brazilians. Every time I visit South America I see new inroads being made by Chinese multinationals. The Monroe Doctrine may be part of US reflexive thinking, but the world has moved on in the last quarter century. The Chinese are even in a cesspool like Haiti. Huawei, to give another example, is now in Mexico. If you have the time I urge you to watch this video on Chinese investment in Mexico:

                I take BRICS as Russia’s attempt, via rivalry, at an alliance with globohomo, not as a big play to defeat it. Most of the BRICS countries are deeply at odds with the British and American finance/military blob—they’reother countries—but some of them aren’t. There’s no sense in which, e.g., Brazil isn’t a full member of the Axis of Anal.We’ve known Putin a long time. He’s a shitlib aspirant who can’t deal with our current leadership and has a patriotic wish that Russia survive—as the kind of multiculti empire the Anglosphere claims to be, not the planetary pederasty machine it actually is. He doesn’t “win” because he doesn’t want to. He longs for our embrace (non-sexual).

                    That may have been true at one point.  It may still be true if the West mends its ways, or the right leader comes along.  But like the long departed girlfriend, I think Putin has realized it is time to move on.  Maybe he still has a small ember glowing for her in the depths of his heart, but not while she is in her current junky state.

This elocution alone is worthy of a Pulitzer Prize. It is brutally apt and funny. But how could any of this be otherwise. Our president is a pedophile dementia patient. Our VP worked her way to the top of the political pyramid on her back. Our Sec of State is a failed wannabe rock guitarist.

        There are now voices in China suggesting that China should find countries in Latin America that they can treat like Russia treats Iran – basically get friendly with them and help them develop their military and nuclear capabilities. The aim would be to distract the US away from East and South East Asia. If they can pull it off, it would be great for them, but also potentially good for Europe, so I root for the Chinks.

        This is a terrific analysis by the Z-man.The Foreign Policy establishment got high on toppling tin-pot dictators like Noriega and Milosvic, and thought they were the League of Justice. The Taliban took to the hills, Saddam was a bit of harder nut to crack, but he went too. Then Qaddaffi. It was all just giggles and glee for Albright, Hillary and the Neocons. W figured God was on his side, too.They ignored the wreckage, waste, mayhem and bloodshed left in their wake.Haiti, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Libya, Syria, and now Ukraine. “Look on my work, ye mighty, and despair!”

The Chinese are more dumbfounded about how dumb our “leaders” are.An optimistic view is that maybe they (Russia, China) realize how good is the west at creation compared to them and try to save us from our own stupidity to save the Golden Goose that is our civilization. China is great at tech adoption, but the muscle of creativity is still the US/West EU. Maybe we can persuade the Chinese to sink the ships full of invaders to save civilization. They looove our old school entertainment based on white beauty so we can tell them, sink the ships and sabotage the NGOs if you want more movies with gorgeous white chicks, amazing tech, and top notch medicine.

                “Not a China apologist, but I think at least their dishonesty is somewhat productive.”Yes, there is a baseline but annoying “Let’s see if the oppenent is smart enough to detect the error while saving face” sort of lying. Once you have an agreement however, the Chinese are honor bound to deliver it.  I might accidentally order junk that belongs in the trash in China drop shipped from there. However it will be somewhat honoring the form of the agreement and it will make it to my door. Not all Chinese goods are total garbage either.What do you with someone who says they will deliver X on this date and then delivers Y on a later date? That is if they deliver anything at all. That’s a complete disaster.

        I highly recommend reading Quigley on the subject of WWII. He gives a comprehensive, although admittedly granular and tedious, overview of the situation leading up to the war. Economic and political forces, the different factions in each nation, etc. If you have the patience, you’ll come away with a different view of things.It is bizarre that Putin is cast as Hitler, since he’s possibly been the most pro-Western Russian leader we’ll ever get. Then again, from a different POV, pro-Western Hitler might not be such a bizarre concept, just sayin’.(No, I’m not a fan. I think the Nazis sperged out with their racial science and all, and were a disaster for the West. And their anti-liberalism was obviously antagonistic to the French, British, and Americans, and people argue about that ideological crap to this day. But sorry, they weren’t anti-Western. There’s more than one Western ideological tradition.)”If the Chinese think your candor is a problem, you have a serious problem with honesty.”Lol, TRUTH.

            I place the blame on Clinton with Serbia and then W with Georgia. The former led Yeltsin to turn his country over to Putin, the latter began the slow divorce from the West. The West could have bought a few more decades of unrivaled dominance without going psycho bitch on Russia, but the scorpion and frog thing prevailed. To refresh, the Ukes started shelling the ethnic Russians in earnest the last part of 2021, and the dingbat Harris made a public display of inviting Ukraine into NATO a few months before the invasion. The war was provoked and premeditated and will end badly for the actual aggressor.Pussy Riot, the gay rights movement, adoption moratorium, and so forth simply were psyops that played complemented the violence.

                    The problem is that the West keeps trying to dominate and subjugate Russia instead of treating them like an equal. The West is afraid that Russia will surpass them, that’s why the West stops trying to sabotage Russia at every turn.

        The Chinese, who had a similar dynamic in their political elite as the Russians, experienced a similar evolution in thought about how they deal with the West, especially Washington.I recall reading that the Chinese geostrategist Wang Huning was enthusiastically ‘pro’ American, until he as a young man made an extended visit to the US. He was appalled by the disparity between his preconceptions (undoubtedly formed in large part by globohomo propaganda) and the reality he observed with his own eyes. He went back and spent a career in part warning against allowing China to become culturally ‘Americanized’. The same article noted that the usual pattern upon ascension of a new leader in China was that the new leader would always bring in a completely new set of people for senior policy and advisory positions, but that Huning was seen as above this kind of factionalism (China-first above all else, if you will) and survived every transition with his influence intact.

        Simply want to say that this is one of your best essays. The point about Merkel wanting to humiliate Putin is spot on, as is the way the managerial elite style themselves as modern Churchills, and that is the reason for their visceral reaction to Tucker.
In short, you remember to include that these are real people with, ultimately, petty, selfish motives (as we all have). So much of the modern commentators, when describing the political class (regardless of sides), act like Hamlet: making his father Hyperion and his daddy-uncle a satyr. The reality is much more mundane.Thanks.

        Somehow I managed to sit through the entirety of last night’s debacle.
The only positives-
Trump actually managed to do the, “I’m speaking,” meme, twice!
At worst, he managed to fight his 3 debate opponents to a draw.
Show notes-
Trump did get a bit rambly at times.
Somehow, the female ABC moderator was the least worst of the opposition. She also asked Cackles a few non-softball questions.

        The Clausewitz quote is actually; “War is the continuation of politicswithother means.” Subtle difference but implies the two continue together.

            Dang, I never thought to look it up.  Spot on:“We see, therefore, that war is not merely an act of policy but a true political instrument, a continuation of political intercourse, carried on with other means. What remains peculiar to war is simply the peculiar nature of its means. War in general, and the commander in any specific instance, is entitled to require that the trend and designs of policy shall not be inconsistent with these means. The art of war in its most comprehensive sense is therefore the understanding of the organization and conduct of war as part of an entire system of policy, in which the means used, and the ends achieved, must be harmonious and complementary.”

        I wanted to send you my final analysis on the 2024 presidential race and why its critical to vote for Trump.This election isn’t about Trump v Harris but about symbolism. The white symbol verses the black symbol.Europeans are thinkers, analysts, and can be objective, but blacks are strictly emotional, shallow and cannot fathom systems level analysis. They live in the here and now chasing instant gratification because that’s all they’re capable of. As a result, they are a threat to a modern world they will never understand or be able to replicate. However, because Europeans think, and analyze, many are disillusioned with the political process, its current candidates and as a result, have become alienated. This alienation process serves the jews. To cut to the chase, jews have been behind the weaponization of US blacks for over a century because it serves their interests of dividing up Europeans. They were behind the implementation of the 1960s great society welfare system that has bred millions of violent antisocial psychopaths who harbor outright hate for whites. We all know this is true. We’ve seen this acted out in the many urban riots across the US for decades. For these reasons it’s critical to understand the jews, despite a lot of misdirection, are 100% behind Harris. Don’t be fooled by jews claiming to support Trump. They are waging war against us and lying is just part of their warfare. With this in mind, its very important to understand this race is really about race, and nothing more. Regardless the positions of either candidate, in the end, it’s the symbol that matters, and we do not want the black symbol to win. If the black symbol wins, this will be even more discouraging to thinking Europeans and have only temporary emotional effects on the blacks as jews will continue monopolization of our society and the tightening of the death grip they have over us. Vote for the white symbol.

            I tend to agree. Major problem: Progressivism (Wokery, whatever historical term you prefer) is 99% is a European malady in general and an American one in particular. Perhaps we are at Peak Jew in the 21st century, but they were pretty sparse on the ground in Puritan America. Even if it were a reanimated George Floyd running on the ticket, perhaps half of Whites would still vote Democrat.Dark humor: on the debate, one of Trump’s jibes was (paraphrased): “If Harris is elected, Israel will be gone in two years.” If they could get that in writing, I suspect that millions of Dissidents would vote for her. 😈

            I get what you are saying, but the “Amish” control both candidates. They always set it up as a tails we win, heads you lose contest. So sure, vote for the symbol, but realize it is only symbol. Beatings will continue until morale improves.As for the malady of wokery, it is in large part a White female phenomenon. Offing your offspring has become a sacred right even if they themselves may not partake (or claim they would not). It is not unlike the normie bragging about his small arsenal even though he knows he doesn’t have the balls to use it.I know several otherwise well-meaning White females who would die on the hill to kill her children or gladly hand over their birthright to some foreign invader. And now that I think about it, most of it stems from ancestor hatred – hating your roots – brought to you by our greatest allies.

        An “agreement” with the United States has zero validity unless it is ratified by the various states through their representatives in the Senate. Any new occupant of the Executive Branch has the absolute right to ignore any or all “accords” “agreements” “alliances” of the previous administration. The world needs to understand this reality and proceed accordingly.

            Except the 17th amendment annuls the Senate as representative of the states’ will. I think sooner rather than later the states will forcefully reassert themselves. This may throw a monkey-wrench into the plans of the Globalists in DC, especially if Harris is elected and actively pursues the admission of DC and PR as states.
