        I have a terrific neighbor who immigrated legally from Mexico City around 40 years ago. He worked hard, built a successful construction business, invested in real estate, married and had two wonderful kids, bought a nice house for his family, and retired very well off. These days he travels the world.  To say he’s livid over the border crisis is an understatement.  Whenever he sees me he lectures me about how wrong illegal immigration is.  “When is that ##$!@%$# Obama going to fix the border and stop those illegals coming?” he rants…as if I had the answer.  He is one really piss*d off Mexican ex-pat.

        Cute Mexican waitress at a favorite Mexican restaurant in our quaint little Florida drinking town with a fishing problem tells me she doesn’t like visiting her Mexican mother in California.
Why, I asked.
Too many Mexicans, she replied.
True story.
I love most of my new Mexican neighbors.  Family oriented, good work ethic, smart; If they end up taking sizeable chunks of our country away from us, they will probably have earned it.  We’ve raised a couple of generations who know nothing of mowing lawns or processing chicken or picking avocadoes.  They’re going to own us one day.

            I fully admit to being torn on immigration. I’ve known a lot of Hispanics and even the gangsters are decent people. My own read is they make the same trek as Italians, Greeks, Poles, Irish and other Catholic immigrants a century ago. No one thinks of Italians or Irish as anything but typical white people, as Obama would put it. I feel the same way about Hindus and Chinese.
That’s only if we get control of the border and immigration policy. I’m not optimistic on that score.
