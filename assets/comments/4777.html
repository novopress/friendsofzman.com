        Here is the thing about Charleston and all the other ‘race crimes’ of late. Perfectly put by Ole Remus in a guest post at Bastion of Liberty:Frankly My Dear: A Guest Post From Ol’ Remushttp://bastionofliberty.blogspot.com/2015/06/frankly-my-dear-guest-post-from-ol-remus.htmlYou want to know the game? Today TPTB are calling this murder “Domestic Terrorism”.I used to think it too cynical for all the conspiracy sites to trumpet their latest ‘the gubmit is coming to get us’. But the Feral Gov’t of DC these days is making me rethink. Maybe the black woman from Charleston who claimed the mucker was sent is not that far off.

        I suspect that the whitey who committed the crime — if proved, of course — was arrested peacefully and “came quietly” because he knew the game was up. He had been caught and knew that further kicking and screaming was just about useless.Contrast that with the number of other shades who think that fighting back all the time is the best way to conduct oneself at the time of arrest.I once knew a copper in the UK and while admittedly he served in a very different place and time he said it was possible for many years to say to a perp “Oi! I want to see you down at the police station” and would then continue his patrol and said perp would duly go to the cop shop and tell the duty officer he was wanted for questioning. No doubt the perp thus told was a whitey but the essence of it was “it’s a fair cop” in the slang of the time. Next time a non-whitey is arrested, maybe the same thing will happen, but I am not counting on it.

            I would not be surprised to learn that her parents or grandparents took the name Attiah in the 60’s or 70’s. It was a popular thing for educated blacks in that period to adopt African names. Of course, it is still popular to take on Muslim names, even when they are not Muslim. I’ve run into so many people with tribal names I recognize, only to learn their ancestors changed the name in the sixties.The truly amusing ones are the black people who take Arabic names from tribes dominant in the Levant, given how those people feel about black Africa.Karen Attiah’s resume suggests she is “passing” for African for the piety points. Everything about her resume screams “gaming the system.”

        Affirmative action would indeed leave the lonely fellow who achieved success through merit in a state of resentment toward the posers, but affirmative action is more clever than that; it has also leveled the exceptional man.

            Derb said it best:For many American blacks, especially elite blacks like the Obamas, nothing exists outside their own blackness. Their blackness is endlessly interesting, endlessly fascinating to them. They can never get enough of thinking about it, talking about it, reading and writing about it.If they write a book, it’s about their blackness: Barack Obama’s Dreams from My Father, for example. If they write a college paper, it’s about their blackness: Mrs Obama’s Princeton thesis, for example, the seven words of whose title contain the word “black” twice. If they read a book, it’s about blackness. I’ve spent many, many hours riding the New York subway. Sitting next to a black person who’s reading a book, I take a peek: two times out of three it’s some black author writing about blackness.Black black blackety-blackety-black. It fills their consciousness and absorbs their attention. What on earth must it be like to so trapped like that, such a prisoner of your own skin? I can’t imagine. I guess, just as the T-shirt slogan says: It’s a black thing; I wouldn’t understand.
