        Whatever you say about the Republicans can equally be said over here for the Conservatives. You would think a party calling itself that might be conservative, but no! Perish the thought!The Tories have become middle of road with leftist sympathies, which seems to merely drive the usual lefties (aka Labour) even more leftward in a desire to be so utterly different from the Conservatives who have taken Labour’s traditional position. For example the Tories love the socialist NHS but to socialists they don’t love it nearly enough.Elections here are mostly “Do you want a little socialism or a lot more socialism with your European dictatorship?”

        My money is on change. The number of scalps taken continues to rise. What’s ironic is it would only have taken some effort to put a few points on the board. Instead the leadership of both houses continue to get stuffed in their lockers by a second rater.

        “Lightly managed trade, constitutional liberty … regulated immigration.”  It takes ideology to understand the importance of these, and Republicans ain’t got ideology.  Even when they win, they lose.

        The experience of Europe in the first third of the 20th century is not encouraging.You can say that again!!  I’ve long maintained that the inevitable counterweight to the ideological party of the new religion is aculturalnational socialist party.The old laissez-faire, individual-rights Right (the Burkean Right, as they might still say in poli sci classes) is as dead as disco, because it requires a strong, self-confident, openly Judeo-Christian culture that we haven’t had since the 60s… if not 1918.  Going back there isn’t an option — too many people are on unemployment, addicted to iCrap, or both — but cultural marxismcanbe defeated with strong cultural leadership at the top.  I know you read the “alt-right.” Those dudes sound like Hendrik Verwoerd, and their ideal state sounds a lot like his — socialism for the Boers, a police state for the blacks.It’s been done before, I guess I’m saying, and with great success.  Theideasare still alive and kicking; combined with the right culture — the right salesman — such a party could sweep up just about anybody who has ever felt uncomfortable around a blue-haired, nose-ringed vegan.  It’d be enough to win one election, anyway…. and one election is all they’d need.

        “The South is much more mildly opposed to immigration”. Any area that has a lot of blacks, is not so dismayed at the idea of replacing them with hispanics. Too bad for other areas that the blacks move to.Has anyone else noticed a lot of new apartments being built in “low black” areas, and an increase in black people? Around here, it’s like there’s a gold rush, what with all the new apartments being slapped up. I hope it’s more the market responding to people who want to flee the cities, and not slumlords building up in response to Obama’s “spread the misery” HUD directives.
