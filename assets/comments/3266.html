        That’s why I said pellet guns are a separate issue. They are, in fact, guns in the conventional sense of the word. They may fire a low velocity projectile of a small caliber, but they can still put an eye out, as they say. Some can kill a small animal.Frankly, I’d never let my kid go to a public park with a pellet gun for exactly that reason. Most people would not know the difference. This appears to be an urban area so it makes even less sense.Still, the cop has a responsibility to make damned sure it is a proper shoot. The fact that it is on video should establish it one way or the other.

        It was obviously the ambition of this kid to be carrying the real thing sooner rather than later. And, the cops were too quick to shoot. One does not negate the other.
Every time I hear a cop say that he has a right to go home at the end of the day I think, no, no more than I do. Maybe less.

        This Daily Mail article contains a slightly less cuddly picture of Tamir and a not cuddly at all picture of the Airsoft Colt 1911 – No way a cop, or an experienced shooter could easily know that that gun is not real in a high stress situation.
Here’s the Daily Mail’s story:http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2846824/The-cops-know-doing-doesn-t-Father-s-grief-12-year-old-son-shot-dead-Cleveland-police-waving-BB-gun-playground.html
Here’s a link to the 911 call:Not a confidence builder if you’re betting your life on a 911 operator.http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/24/cleveland-shot-boy/19471925/

        Airsoft gun.  If you’re not familiar with airsofting, it’s a recreational activity for chubby Mall Ninja types, so the guns are made to look as close to the real thing as possible.
The fact that it was missing the orange muzzle that is usually customary is somewhat telling as well.
