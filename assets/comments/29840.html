        Our regime is a branch of the folks at the very top, the private owners of the world‚Äôs central banks are attempting to aggregate all wealth in their own hands and turn the world‚Äôs population into dirt-poor serfs, or worse;This process is only warming up with much worse to come, and if their plans  continue it will likely result in the complete destruction of western civilization and possibly of humanity itself.

        General admiration: I‚Äôm pleased that Zman generates such high quality essays as today‚Äôs, as often as he does, especially given the other demands upon his time. Well worth the $5 per month I send his way to defray the cost of keeping the night light aglow in his hallway bathroom. üôÇ

            I agree entirely agree Layabout. I too pay the 5 bucks monthly. I‚Äôm sure Z will raise it soon citing inflation. I‚Äôll also point out that Z recently missed webcasting a podcast. He had some lame excuse about the editing time, background noises, throat fatigue, cats‚Ä¶blah, blah, blah. If he doesn‚Äôt go up too much I‚Äôll continue with the service. After all, I canceled Fox Nation immediately after they fired Tucker. Oh, and on that note, I was not crazy, even Tucker made comments about the functionality of the website being shit. I thought it was just me. I only dealt with it to see his interviews and some of his specials.

        What Z is describing is the Power Structure. It consists, in the main, of FedGov, Hollywood, Big Media, Big Bidniss (including Silicon Valley), and education, with higher ed in the van. The job of the Power Structure is to fool the sheeple, the better to fleece them. And to do that, it must not only have a monopoly on the right to use violence, it must have a near monopoly on the dissemination of information and narrative. Our Democracy, peace be upon its name, is a postmodern totalitarian state.

            Propaganda, in other words. Severely retarded propaganda, to be precise. The Banana Empire sill controls much of the world and will be lucky to have running water in two years. Not only are the sheeple fooled, the garbage tier cretins who run this shitshow have convinced themselves their own retarded propaganda is gospel truth. IDIOCRACY was overly optimistic. The low rent oligarchs stupidly will look up as nukes descend on us, their mouths agape like the dinosaurs who watched the meteors race across the sky. Although, to be fair, the dinosaurs were able to distinguish between males and females.

                She actually looks like a clown. I can‚Äôt stand to watch her. I think Biden picked her specifically to offend whites because she is so freakishly African-looking and because she is in an inter-racial lesbian marriage.

        The Biden regime has no choice but to turn the BS meter to eleven. It is an illegitimate regime installed through a transparently stolen election. It cannot govern by consent, so it has no choice but to rule by force. As always, propaganda is a huge part of ruling by force.The fix is already in for 2024. It certainly appears that the Republican party will play the role of stooge and will rig the primary so Trump cannot be on the ballot, in which case Republican turnout will be so bad that there will be no need for the Democrats to steal the election. But in the unlikely event that Trump is the Republican candidate the election fraud will be epic and transparent to even the dumbest normiecon. The crackdown on dissidents, including most of us here, in 2025 will make Stalin look like a piker.

        Re: the mass shooter phenomenon, I like to quote from Sundance on this point:‚Äú‚ÄúThe FBI was fully aware of the Boston Marathon bombers, the Tsarnaev brothers, before they executed their plot.  The FBI took no action.  The FBI knew about the San Bernardino terrorists, specifically Tasfeen Malik, and were monitoring her communications before her and Syed Farook executed their attack killing 14 people and leaving 22 others seriously injured.  The FBI took no action.  The FBI knew Colorado grocery store shooter Ahmad Alissa before he executed his attack.  The FBI took no action.The FBI knew in advance of the Pulse Nightclub shooter (Omar Mateen) and were tipped off by the local sheriff. The FBI knew in advance of the San Bernardino Terrorists (Tashfeen Malik). The FBI knew in advance of the Boston Marathon Bombers (the Tsarnaev brothers) tipped off by Russians.  The FBI knew in advance of the Parkland High School shooter (Nikolas Cruz). The FBI knew in advance of the Fort Hood shooter (Nidal Hasan), and the FBI knew in advance of Colorado grocery store shooter Ahmad al-Aliwi Alissa.  The FBI took no action. Consider the case of the first recorded ISIS attack on U.S. soil in Garland, Texas in 2015.  The FBI not only knew the shooters n advance, the FBI took the shooters to the venue and were standing only a few yards away when [they] opened fire.  Yes, you read that correctly ‚Äì the FBI took the terrorists to the event and then watched it unfold.  ‚ÄúAn FBI trainer suggested in an interview with ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù that, had the attack been bigger, the agency‚Äôs numerous ties to the shooter would have led to a congressional investigation.‚ÄùRemember, shortly before the 2018 mid-term election, when Ceasar Syoc ‚Äì a man living in his van ‚Äì was caught sending ‚Äúenergetic material that can become combustible when subjected to heat or friction‚Äù, or what FBI Director Christopher Wray called ‚Äúnot hoax devices‚Äú?   Remember how sketchy everything about that was, including the child-like perpetrator telling a judge later than he was trying to walk back his guilty plea because he was tricked into signing a confession for a crime he did not create. Or more recently, the goofball plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer that involved 18 suspects, twelve of them actually working for the FBI as the plot was hatched?  And we cannot forget the January 6th. DC protest turned insurrection effort, which is clearly looking like an FBI inspired and coordinated effort. Have we forgotten the Atlanta ‚ÄúOlympic Park Bombing‚Äù, and the FBI intentionally setting up transparently innocent, Richard Jewel? Then, there‚Äôs the entirety of the FBI conduct in ‚ÄúSpygate‚Äù, the demonstrably evident FBI operation to conduct political surveillance against Donald Trump using their investigative authorities; and the downstream consequences of a massive institutional effort to cover up one of the biggest justice department scandals in history‚Ä¶‚ÄùFrom:https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2022/12/22/elon-musk-perplexed-as-twitter-begins-widespread-suspensions-of-accounts-critical-of-u-s-funding-for-ukraine-and-zelenskyy-grift/

            The FBI basically wrote the manifesto of Buffalo race shooter Payton Gendron. Read it. No 18-year old community college kid wrote that, I can assure you.
Why else would the kid invite an (ahem) ‚Äúretired‚Äù FBI agent to watch the shooting live on Discord?

            As soon as I heard about the FBI‚Äôs involvement at Garland TX, it wasn‚Äôt hard to make the leap that a similar level of involvement would have been the case at some non-zero number of other mass shootings.
You know it. I know it. The MSM knows it. But unlike us, they can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt talk about it. How do they live with themselves

He‚Äôs merely swinging the pendulum back to ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù and ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù for anyone dumb enough to think there‚Äôs more than one side to this chess game.

        Speaking of Norway, Brevik was the only right wing mass killer to date that actually picked his targets logically, targeting the regime and the children of the elites being processed into activists at that summer camp.  He didn‚Äôt shoot up a jewish deli or a black church, which is what the media prefers as it feeds into preestablished normie bad guy narratives.Noteworthy though is that he accomplished next to nothing in the end.  Hunting one future AOC for sport in the woods may be fun, but two more are waiting to take her place as cogs in the regime.  Also his spergy manifesto was something like 1000 pages long, ensuring no one was going to read it.  The moral is that doing stuff in minecraft isn‚Äôt effective, it just presents the regime with an opportunity to cry out in pain as they strike back.The other moral is that narratives need to be nice and simple for normie.  The left wing story is almost subverbal, just a series of scenes in movies and cartoons throughout a normie‚Äôs life where the black guy is good and the white guy is mean.  On the right, well, the other day I listened to an audiobook by Mordekai Moldberg, and while the Orson Welles deepfake voice was pleasant most of what I got out of the text is how much Moldberg wants you to know that he‚Äôs a smart boy who can emphasize his point with foreign phrases.  ‚ÄúSi la chatte sent le fromage, il ne faut pas y mettre le nez.‚Äù

            One of the kids he didn‚Äôt kill is the mayor of a city that I‚Äôve had to change my retirement plans to avoid.AB‚Äôs lasting accomplishment was the erasure of the phrase ‚Äúcultural Marxism‚Äù from history.

        Brilliant stuff today Zman, thanks for all you doInteracting with friends of various political persuasions, I find myself unable to break their wall of denial about how fake it all is. Even when the manipulation is obvious and out in the open, government officials and media members planning together what stories to break and when to break them, govt officials controlling what is on social media, fake press conferences, none of that is secret information or hard to know about, but they just can‚Äôt bring themselves to admit the truth that it is one big informational panopticon. They can‚Äôt seem to make the mental connection that if that one is fake, then these others are probably fake too. It‚Äôs like a mental bridge too far. Until these things are acknowledged by the anchorman with the anchorman voice, they aren‚Äôt real.Was it always this way? Were 80% of people always willfully blind idiots? Mencken would definitely say yes. But I seem to remember a time when people were more thoughtful, more discerning, when there wasn‚Äôt anything that could be called a mind virus. About most things. But about GAE militarism, the mind virus was real even in the conservative white place where I grew up. Back then I was afflicted with it too. It took many years to shake it off.

            Perhaps it is literally impossible to live without a social narrative.   For the nobodies of this world, like 99% of us, that narrative is second-hand, at best (more like third hand)  The ‚Äònews‚Äô gives us that narrative.   There are alternatives to that narrative (‚Äòconspiracy theories‚Äô), but while those alternative narratives may be true or false, they are unlikely to be consistent, because a) honest men will disagree and b) most alternative narratives are no-more honest than the ‚Äònews‚Äô.    Plus, being unconstrained by truth, the mainstream news can be a lot more consistent than can honest seekers of the truth (who may have honest grounds for disagreement)It‚Äôs asking an awful lot of most people to break from the mainstream narrative.  Maybe even asking the impossible.

Maybe even asking the impossible.‚ÄùI do not disagree with your premise.What I will say is that, where there was defined a distinction between ‚Äò‚Äùpush‚Äù and ‚Äúpull‚Äù marketing, when email was in its infancy, a though occurs.Most people only receive the ‚Äúpush‚Äù, what is put under their noses. They are not intellectually curious. They are non readers. they are both. We will call them the ‚Äúsheeple‚Äù as a working term.Others, fewer, embrace the ‚Äúpull‚Äù approach. They are, by definition, intellectually curious. They read, baseline all the classics. Have some specialty that requires seeking a lot of information, the broader the spectrum the better. They FIND information because they seek it. Thirst for it.It is this last that MIGHT self cure from the mind virus. They have a frame of reference, a nose trained for other purposes, or simply their nature ‚Ä¶ to sniff out the lies. The intellectual horsepower to process the lies.

                    Agree, and this ties in with my other comment, below.  Propagandizing the non-reader is easy.   Put it on the box, repeat it three times a day, and you‚Äôre done.   It‚Äôs the ‚Äòpullers‚Äô, as you put it, who are hard to deal with.   I suggest a huge part of the burden of the narrative industrial complex is about the dealing with the ‚Äòpullers‚Äô.  They will go and actively seek out the truth.   The truth can‚Äôt be wholly hidden, but it can be obscured by a million and one false signals.  Signals, ideally, elaborately structured to draw in and exhaust the patience of the ‚Äòpuller‚Äô.   That‚Äôs what the New York Times, ‚Äòpolicy‚Äô magazines and much of the rest of intellectual life are about: chaff, to deflect the self-guided, truth-seeking mind.  Much of the ‚Äòalternative‚Äô media too no doubt.  The key to a career in media is to be interesting, but wrong.

            If I remember right, if you go back to say to the polio scare in the early 1900s, you‚Äôll find Time Magazine (with their famous iron lung cover) had all the machines in the whole US shipped in for the photo. Not one was actually in service but they said hospitals were being overwhelmed. After the photo they shipped them back but the illusion had been created that an epidemic was occurring.The media and politicians have been lying since time immortal, to varying degrees, but something has changed: the population is far more stupid, so everyone does it everywhere all the time. I find it difficult to talk to most people these days because everything‚Äôs a scam and a racket or some stupid ass gimmick.

                The propaganda acceleration is simultaneous with the IQ decline. I believe that is a statement of fact. The time I recall when people were more discerning probably isn‚Äôt just wishful thinking or a rose tinted rear view mirror. They most likely really were smarter.

            I think it was always this way. As a teen 40 years ago I heard the expression ‚ÄúThe masses are asses‚Äù and it made sense to me. If anything there is a lot more information available today that counters official narratives but only a minority of us bother to explore it. In that sense people are worse now.

        The decline of this system is hastened because it‚Äôs also no longer permitted by the state religion to select for skills, competence, or intelligence. Aisha with a 91 IQ and a flare for bossiness captaining the $3B Arleigh Burke destroyer is indicative of this nonsense.The system necessitates high levels of highly capable people for it to run. On the aggregate, this means that the outputs will decline rapidly as the able and exceptional are replaced by the stupid and politically connected. But it‚Äôs ok, because the decline is the cost of ‚Äúwho we are‚Äù and we cannot change ‚Äúwho we are.‚ÄùCouple this with the rather rapid decline of the dollar as a reserve currency and we are in for a drastic reduction in standard of living. US now has an average IQ of 97.5 and this will probably fall to the low 90s by 2035. We will get an economy, a country, and a system that reflects this reality. Closer to Queens than it will be to Fairfax County. And the powers that be simply don‚Äôt care. They‚Äôll take away your rifle, your gas stove and your meat. But they‚Äôll have all of those things and live in Fairfax while telling us how racist and evil we are.

        The USSR is a great example of this.  Something you don‚Äôt have to reach back 200 years to a different time to see.  By the mid 1980‚Äôs everyone knew it was morally bankrupt except for most hardened communists.  The ones who saw communism as a religion the way the purple hairs see things today.   But everyone shuffled along and did their thing because the ruble did indeed still buy a bottle of vodka, a loaf of bread, and a pack of terrible cigarettes.  The people themselves considered it to be a net win, barely, because they still had things like heat.   It wasn‚Äôt until the currency failed circa 1991 that it all crashed down.The vast majority of human beings can be bought, and cheaply.  It‚Äôs only when they can no longer be bought when the real problems start for a regime.  One thing I admire about the French, is at least they demand an ever so slightly higher price to be bought.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just a whore, I‚Äôm a French whore and you will pay me the value of being a French whore.‚Äù  Americans on the other hand, even with vast amounts of firearms, could likely be bribed with free Taco Bell coupons.

            Correct. The facade can (and will) be maintained as long as the money is good. The system may be blatantly, ludicrously dishonest, profoundly unfair, morally depraved, and even scorned, even scorned by a majority, but as long as most everyone has a couple of bucks and the well stocked HugeMart is just down the street, why kick up a fuss?

            Oswald Spengler: ‚ÄúWhereas, Orwell‚Äôs Winston Smith diligently altered the records of the Party‚Äôs past in Oceania, the media apparatchiks of our current regime assiduously work to alter perceptions of the present.‚ÄùIn the immortal words of Saint Joseph Djugashivili: ‚ÄúThe future is known; it is the past which is in doubt.‚Äù===============Z: ‚ÄúAgain, the media has always been run by regime toadies, but thirty years ago most of what they did was reporting. The bigshot columnists and editors were allowed to put their thumb on the scale in terms of what got promoted.‚ÄùAt some point, our society‚Äôs timeline ventured through a ‚Äúsingularity‚Äù, and everything got flipped around backwards &amp; upside-down, with the Normies being largely oblivious to what had happened.I don‚Äôt know when this occurred exactly ‚Äì you could argue that it was as early as 1896, when the Ochs family seized control of the NY Times, or as recently as September 11, 2001, when the Ochs family conspired with a number of other prominent families of their acquaintance, to bring down a pair of skyscrapers in downtown Manhattan [which had conveniently just been re-insured for acts of terrorism, netting a post-terrorism payout of almost FIVE BILLION DOLLARS].The more I think about it, it occurs to me that two other signature events were of crucial importance in the timeline:A) The premeditated murder of Charles Lindbergh‚Äôs child, and the subsequent character assassination of Charles Lindbergh‚Äôs reputation [after all, who can trust a man who can‚Äôt even successfully defend his own family?]B) David Sarnoff‚Äôs absolute decimation &amp; destruction of Philo Farnsworth [this is also where you would file the contributions of Edward Bernays, who lived to be 103, dadgum that adrenochrome tastes good!!!]So there‚Äôs your timeline: I suspect that the singularity could have been traversed as early as 1896, or as recently as 2001.But after passing through the singularity [whenever it was that the passing occurred], the result was a society with a media which no longer reported largely factual information, with blood kinsmen of the populace doing the reporting, but which instead began to mount ceaseless neverending nigh unimaginable psychological warfare campaigns, delivered by a foreign tribe which sought to destroy the populace.And here‚Äôs my point: After we passed through that singularity, the media no longer answered to the government, but rather the government answered to the media.The government, as we understand the term [the president, the speaker of the house, the senate majority leader, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, etc etc etc], the government is NOT in charge.The media is in charge, and the government is merely a serfdom which answers sycophantically to its media overlords.==========PRO-TIP: Never forget that it was a QUAKER, named Henry Alloway, which facilitated the sale of the New York Times to the Ochs family.

        The cost of empire for the US has been the loss of a huge portion of our industrial base. To keep the dollar as the global reserve currency means running big deficits, particularly with industrial countries who need the dollars to buy energy, which means that our trade deficit is heavily in manufactured goods.The cost of empire has been a hollowing out of the Rust Belt. It also means that we had huge government debt. Both of those are needed to keep the system running and GAE afloat. Just Rome needed to conquer new territories, we need to keep running big deficits.But with the rise of China, that cost is being exposed. Europe was willing to accept our dollars for manufactured goods. China is getting tired of that deal and is starting to use our dollars to buy things instead of treasuries. China also wants to develop its own domestic demand.If the world slows (not stops, just slows) its purchases of treasuries, we‚Äôll discover very quickly the true cost of empire.

                Well, Fedcoin would be a pretty terrifying development for many reasons, but not sure that it can impact the Eurodollar system and the global debt problems.The US govt (and many other countries) has a debt and deficit problem. Once a country gets past ~100% debt to GDP, it has problems. A Fedcoin doesn‚Äôt change that.We have to hold interest rates below inflation to keep the debt from spiraling out of control. The question is whether the world (investors, businesses, private banks and central banks) will accept that or even if they don‚Äôt like, have to accept it.Somebody has to buy our debt knowing that it will lose them money over time. You can say that‚Äôs crazy and that no one will do it, but they may not have much choice. If you need dollars to do day-to-day business, to pay back a dollar-denominated debt or to protect yourself in times of crisis, you need to either hold actual dollars or an asset that can be sold in the Eurodollar system for dollars when needed.Dollars don‚Äôt pay interest, but treasuries are dollars with an interest rate. Sure, the rate is lower than inflation, but it‚Äôs better than nothing.The question is can I hold another asset that can be converted into dollars at a moment‚Äôs notice? Because when the shit hits the fan, I‚Äôm going to need dollars right now, and I don‚Äôt want to sell my assets as a huge discount to get those dollars. Treasuries fit that bill perfectly. Immediate dollars at no discount.Can another asset take the place of treasuries? Maybe. Central banks are definitely hoarding gold, but is the market for gold big enough that it will handle a mass selling of gold in a crisis?Commodities don‚Äôt fit the bill that well. You have to store them, which is costly. Their price is volatile. What will the market for them be in a crisis? Etc. Bitcoin is even worse as a store of dollar value.Everyone says that they want to de-dollarize, but no other currency can take its place. Everyone says that they don‚Äôt want to hold treasuries that earn less than inflation or that can be seized, but if the dollar remains the GFC, you need a reserve asset that can access dollars at a moment‚Äôs notice with no to little loss in value. Well, outside of treasuries, what asset can do that?Really, the only asset that comes close is gold, but the size of the gold market is a joke compared to size of the treasury market.But the US debt to GDP continues to grow, making the Eurodollar system less and less stable. The whole thing is a mess.

                        You‚Äôre proving my point. What does a money market invest in? T-bills.
Putting your dollars in a money market is investing in treasuries to earn interest that you wouldn‚Äôt get by holding dollars in a checking account. The same is true for you and everyone around the world, except that they don‚Äôt have access to US-based money market, so they buy the treasuries directly.

                That‚Äôs the question. What else can foreigners hold?Well, they‚Äôve been buying something else because foreign holdings of treasuries has been flat for nearly a decade. They still hold a lot of treasuries, but they‚Äôre not buying more. China is the main player. They seem to be using their dollars to buy gold, commodities and to build infrastructure around the world.The slack has been picked up by the Social Security trust fund, US institutional investors (pension funds, endowments, etc.), US banks and the Fed. But the Fed and SS trust fund are no longer buying treasuries.So, just when the need for buyers has skyrocketed, the number of treasury buyers is dwindling. Not good. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, if the treasury market ever started to look shaky, the Fed would step in a buy treasuries. But now you‚Äôre monetizing the debt, which is inflationary.But even if private investors and central banks do buy all those treasuries, that means that other lending gets crowded out. All those dollars going to treasuries means less dollars for other debt, which means less spending elsewhere, which likely slows global growth.This is a problem, and it‚Äôs not going to go away. Govts around the world have too much debt. In fact, everyone has  too much debt. It can‚Äôt be serviced at anything like normal interest rates. If US govt somehow manages to get investors to buy its debt at below inflation rates, that leaves fewer investors for other debt, which means much higher rates, which can‚Äôt be serviced.But coming back to the dollar, so long as the world uses dollars to trade and to make loans, there will be a need for assets that reasonably hold their value and that can be sold for dollars quickly and without a discount. If investors can find something better than treasuries, they‚Äôll use it, which means the Fed has to buy treasuries to keep the interest rate down, which means inflation.

We probably disagree on a lot of this but you may want to look more closely at how things function with the Eurodollar markets. Interest rates are already below the Fed‚Äôs rate. I‚Äôll leave you to figure out what that implies.

                        Well, govt bond rates in Europe and Japan are well below US rates and, certainly, inflation.What it says is that these countries/economies are in even worse shape than our and have even less ability to handle ‚Äúnormal‚Äù rates. We can‚Äôt handle them either, at least not for very long, but they can‚Äôt handle those rates at all.I mean, European banks are pretty notorious. Credit Suisse has been a mess for a while.But this is why a crisis ‚Äì if there is one and there probably will be ‚Äì will likely start outside the US.

        It‚Äôs not just the media and Hollywood.

You might be one of the few who is willing to turn the media off but not until you‚Äôve been subjected to 12 years of forced indoctrination, and strongly encouraged to submit to another 4 years. And after all of that if you are still willing to turn the media off you are probably going to be regarded as some sort of freakish anti-social oddball..‚ÄúFreedom,‚Äù my ass.

            Yes, the public schools, colleges and universities are simply media companies.  Furthermore, due to their addiction to government funding and supination before adverse regulations like Title IX, they are even more captured by BigGov than a broadcast corporation like Fox or CNN is.
But, for a host of reasons, when Conservatives label the media ‚Äòthe enemy of the people,‚Äù they give the Uni‚Äôs a complete pass.  Until we eradicate this blind spot, we can never really reform the lying media in America.

            Right. It also gets more difficult for the narrative makers. I don‚Äôt have any confidence at all that Normie will develop an effective bullshit detector but that ability to keep pumping out more and more narratives, some contradictory, at an increasing rate may prove impossible.
I didn‚Äôt consider the off-the-rails lying as part of the collapse, either, but, yeah.

                    Much of it is a never-ending circle jerk, to be sure. But the same inability to reset and maneuver applies to the narratives created for the True Believer class.

                    I think this is true.   The insane cost of all this elaborate narrative maintenance is massive overkill for 99% of the population, who are happy literally with ‚ÄòOrange Man Bad‚Äô.   The rest, and by far the most expensive part, is for the 1%, the senior managers, the upper middle classes.   Guys who must make a serious cognitive effort to internalize the reality of the world around them (in order to make correct decisions) *and* internalize the narrative that says it all makes sense.   Fortunately, they are very, very well paid for that effort.    I suspect a lot of the economic inequality  we see around us is about keeping this 1% on-side.  It‚Äôs an expensive operation.  Remember, these guys aren‚Äôt the elite (that would be the 1% of the 1%), and there are millions of them.  They‚Äôre the regular senior managers and lawyers, the guys who run vast organizations on the day-to-day level. Every one of us (outside the underclass) has some kind of personal relationship with at least one of those people.  If those guys flip the whole boat turns over, so vast sums are spent keeping them onside.  Both in indoctrination, and in more-or-less outright bribery.

                        I suspect this is why they maintain the pretense of voting, and also why they reacted so much to the accusation that the elections are rigged.  The middle management caste needs to believe in the system, as in the Gervais Principle.

            If we only had the technology of the 60‚Äôs, they would not be able to lie so brazenly and communicate the new narrative so seamlessly. Modern social media has created the emergence of a powerful hive-mind that we haven‚Äôt found the anti-bodies for yet.
Once the social media craze starts to crash, it will be interesting to see how the dopamine addicts survive. We‚Äôre already down in attention span to one minute Tik-Tok videos of people making crazy faces, and soon attention span will be too low to send any clear signals at all.

                I think it is quite the opposite, actually. Slower dissemination of information allowed the narrative to be more carefully crafted and maintained. ‚ÄúKeeping the story straight‚Äù is easier when the Current Thing has been the Current Thing for a long time.
I do agree that the near-non-existent attention span is proving counterproductive to the narrative makers. I‚Äôve even seen instances when they forget what the most recent narrative is.

                Yes, it is a Hive Mind, one that waits eagerly preprogrammed for reception of each forthcoming Hive Command, the latest even more destructive and transgressive than the last.The Hive is largely a female/feminine entity because human females are collectivist creatures operating under syndicalist natures.  Put ‚Äôem in a house together they all start menstruating as one.When the latest luciferian decree issues forth from Goddess Columbia‚Äôs District, the bees thrill to receive the latest tool of power with which they can dishearten, demean, and destroy those outside the Hive.  This is why when you meet a Hive member, very soon he/she/zir will pose a question designed to ascertain immediately whether you are Hive or Not Hive.As the OP points out, social media technology sent the dronies into frenzy, stimulated constantly by dopamine hits and the unique thrill of being on the dominant/winning team, with others under your power.

            The ever-shifting lies on the world stage are exacting a heavy toll on the GAE‚Äôs credibility. It is rather like when police lock somebody into a lie, and then they‚Äôve got ya. It takes a whole lot more energy and inventiveness to keep track of previous lies, and somehow embelish just enough to not totally falsify the initial lies. The GAE is well past that point in the Rest of the World. A little white lying could be forgiven, but not the totality of the self-dealing falsehoods vomited forth on an ongoing basis. The ROW is looking for an exit from thralldom to the globalist economic hitmen.

        Question if you will, Z: what changed over that 30-year period? The costs or something else? I agree that it did change, but remain unclear as to why. If the costs of maintaining empire have increased, and they most certainly have, I don‚Äôt see off hand how that translates into the requirement to switch from some narratives to all narratives.As an aside, it will be impossible to keep changing and updating narratives since technology has increased the velocity and availability of information. Orwell was right in his concept of endless present but that presupposed information disseminated at a slower rate as has turned out. There is an attempt at an eternal now but it seems unworkable as things have turned out.Anyhow, thanks if you can answer.

                    For a decline and fall, I like the metaphor of falling down a very long flight of stairs. There are landings every so often between the various flights of stairs. As a result, things seem to coast along or at least are a bit gentler than the rolling down the steps.

            Tech and demographics would be my guess.  The internet and widespread technology adoption meant that what was way too much work before to even command became just as easy as sending an email.  At the exact time more weight (in every way) was being added to the government, competency began decreasing for all the usual reasons.  Now you have California sending an email to ban diesel trucks using an army of mystery-meats to implement their dreams.

            I think it goes well past 30 years.  I remember the kvetching about how people are reading less newspapers in the 80s.  A lot of the consolidation started back then.
It has always been truly amazing to me how they could blame the readers for falling circulation as they became ever more progressive and ever more anti-white.  You would think there would be even one major newspaper that would change and just try being normal and covering stuff people want to read about and without all the moralizing and anti-whiteness.  But this is too much to ask.

            I think the urgency of the Cold War kept the ruling class locked into a combination of the covenant and the creed. They had the duty to defend the free world, but the duty not to blow it up in a war with Russia. This necessitated keeping the fanatics on a tight leash. There was a time, believe it or not, when the Democrat party was embarrassed by people like Schumer and Pelosi. These types took off when the Cold War ended and the old restraints were relaxed.I wish I could say it will burn itself out and we return to normalcy, but I do not believe it.

                Thank you. Yeah, the Cold War united the leadership across the board, not just the so-called ‚Äúconservative movement.‚Äù I think that very well may be it as the time corresponds as well.
I don‚Äôt think the clock can be reset, either, and that is a terrible loss, particularly for those of us who lived at the height of empire.

                    Although it‚Äôs set in the mostly 18th century and like many of his writings somewhat fanciful, Voltaire‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Man of Forty Crowns‚Äù recounts the flight of a poor peasant having to support Church and other free riders. M. Voltaire lived a long time but checked out before the French Revolution. But writings like this one vividly show the social factors leading to such a revolution.

        ‚ÄúThe more they try to sell the latest narrative, the less likely people are to accept the next narrative.‚ÄùI want to believe that. I really do. However, a stroll over to a normie con site like dailywire makes one a bit depressed. You have plenty over there that shouted about the lies of covid, and then turned the page and believed the media was telling the stone cold truth about Ukraine. It‚Äôs remarkable really. Maybe I should look be more optimistic and see that while the majority bought into things like Iraq, now the majority (even there) seems skeptical of this war.

            Normies are psychologically incapable of grappling with the possibility that EVERYTHING their political, cultural, and economic superiors tells them may be suspect. Normies can handle the idea that 25 % or even half of what they‚Äôre expected to believe is bunk. But the possibility that ALL of it demands their utmost skepticism? That‚Äôs apparently a terrifying place where normies fear to tread.

                    You‚Äôd be shocked at how much of what the average person believes is utter bullshit. I‚Äôm not talking just about today‚Äôs topics either. Modern man laughs at the ludicrous rites of some primitive tribe. Our distant ancestors were no better, though: Draw pictures on the cave wall and the hunt will be successful. Dance and chant a certain way, and the crops will be plentiful. Etc. Yes, we‚Äôve made some useful discoveries in science and the like and it‚Äôs given us civilization with all its plusses and minuses. But did you know that biologically, we are nearly identical to those primitive humans of 100,000 years ago? Nietzsche and no doubt others say that many beliefs, even wrong ones, are useful and perhaps even necessary for life. I didn‚Äôt mean to get all philosophical here, but it‚Äôs a fact that much of what we believe in ‚Äî is not fact.

There‚Äôs a reason. It‚Äôs not that individual facts have to be replaced but that the whole conceptual framework has to be changed. The fake framework of lies that the establishment provides comes ready-made. The replacement of it by another more authentic framework requires individual cognitive work of the kind most people are not capable of. The sheep are many and the goats relatively few.

            The problem the narrative makers have isn‚Äôt gullible and stupid Normies but the ability to put out and maintain new narratives at an increasing rate due to the velocity of information. It is the old saw about keeping the ‚Äústory straight,‚Äù sort of. Orwell‚Äôs concept of an endless present has proved true like much he suggested, but he could not anticipate the technology would outstrip the ability to maintain a narrative, I think. I‚Äôm not optimistic about Normie, either, but the likely inability to maintain the pace of narrative now required offers some hope.

        Even if by the end of June ALL of Ukraine is overrun by Russia, I don‚Äôt think Normie will break free of his normalcy bias. If you point out to him that the same people who lied about Russiagate and the southern border are the same people who lied about Ukraine, it will make no difference. ‚ÄúRussia/Putin is evil‚Äù is a mantra so firmly ensconced by the L√ºgenpresse that most simply will not be able to reach escape velocity from this strange attraction to the Narrative/Industrial complex.

            I have friends who are reluctantly starting to come around to the idea that 9-11 was an inside job probably done with assistance from at least one of our so called allies.
They cannot however accept that the Ukraine bilge put out by the media is all a lie.    To me very strange psychology.

        ‚ÄúIndustrial bullshit machine.‚Äù What a glorious phrase! It distills the systems of the modern West to their essence about as succinctly as possible. Zman really crushed it with this essay today. It puts me in mind of the following quote:‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs leading industry is still the manufacture, packaging, distribution, and marketing of bullshit. High-quality, grade-A, prime-cut, pure, American bullshit.‚Äù‚Äì George CarlinThough Carlin was a leftist, he at least exhibited skepticism/cynicism toward the system. He is among those leftists of yesteryear whom I (sort of) miss, no matter how wrong-headed they may have been about a lot of matters. The spirit of rebellion is somewhat admirable even when it‚Äôs misguided. Today‚Äôs progressives have devolved into mindless lackeys.

            And yet the leftists still think of themselves as bold, independent free-thinkers, while WE are the docile servants of authority.  After all, Trump was an ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù, right? And so everyone vaguely on ‚Äúhis side‚Äù is just searching for a martinet to swing into position behind, and longing for the sharp crack of the whip.

                Suppose I‚Äôve resigned myself to leftists demonstrating rather breathtaking self-unawareness. I consequently find it perversely amusing that they can essentially control all the major apparatuses of our culture yet still consider themselves radicals in the vanguard of righteous resistance. There appears no limit to the ability of humans to delude themselves about themselves. Ego is quite the manipulator. That applies to ALL of us, not simply leftists. Beware.

                Leftists are about to experience cognitive dissonance if RFK Jr‚Äôs campaign gathers some momentum.  He polls at 19 percent currently.
Since he‚Äôs a Kennedy, the leftists should like him, right? Yet he‚Äôs talking about things like corporate control of government.  In the recent past, the leftists would be on board with that.
But now things have changed. Since the corporations (really BlackRock) push DIE and ESG scores, they‚Äôre the Good Guys to the left.   So it‚Äôs confusing.  But it‚Äôs going to be amusing to watch.

                    The best outcome of a RFKJr candidacy may be his AGW lunacy could cause the rest of the Left to back off theirs. Everything is Column A and Column B to them. Even Normiecons can wander off the reservation a wee tiny bit from time to time, but leftists, not a centimeter. So if RFKJr=bad, his climate alarmism=bad.

        ‚ÄúWhat all of this suggests is that the cost of maintaining the rationale for the Global American Empire has reached the point of diminishing returns‚ÄùFor the System as a whole, yes. For the Elite at the top, no. They can just tax us at gunpoint and force tribute by way of debt, military threats and seigniorage on foreign peoples. Just as in Rome, this can go on for a long time before the inexorable forces of Thermodynamics assert themselves.The narrative system is the Psyop that accompanies this process. The plunder requires moral justification. Enter the media toadies.Yet the system does require occasional victories and a good Caesar every now and then. We‚Äôve had a few Caligulas and Neros recently, so you would think we might get a Marcus Aurelius at some point. Or could the Persians capture Uncle Joe at some point?

        I been around now for about 2/3rds of a century, and to the best of my knowledge, have never known anyone who read the NY Times or Washington Post. Nor have I read so much as a single article in either of these publications EVER. Any yet, I am continually assaulted by references to them in other media (like this blog), which is the only exposure to them that i ever get. The experience is like stepping in dog shit diarrhea while out for a pleasant walk. I DON‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT MANUFACTURED NARRATIVES BY PEOPLE WHO ARE INSANE AND MALICIOUS. And I can‚Äôt stop it, so the best I can do is to proactively avoid it.And I think a lot of people are just like me, i.e. fed up with the permanent stink of narratives that permeate everything and everywhere. It‚Äôs like living next to a sewage treatment plant and being downwind.But this is another problem that is cured by collapse. All the worthless shit mongers will be out of work and likely starving because the demand for shit shovelers will fall to zero.

            I live in rural Pennsylvania.  I do not think I have encountered a single person in the last two years who supports Biden or anything his cabal is doing.  In fact, most people with whom I have social intercourse do not hesitate to express their disdain for him and his crew as well as a great deal of concern for the direction we are being taken by that crew.  When one uses the term ‚Äúnormie,‚Äù I can‚Äôt think of a group of people who fit that definition better than those in my immediate surroundings, yet none of them merit the scorn heaped on them by those who, like Wkathman, seem to believe they are unaware of what is transpiring and/or too passive to do anything about it.  I mean no offense, but I would not be so quick to judge everyone who fails to pass some ideological purity test.  Such a reflexive condemnation is something more suited to those on the left.

I probably know more than that, those are just the two I know for sure. Moreover, I don‚Äôt associate with many people, so from my perspective two is a big number. I deduce that there are plenty of NYT readers out there.
But I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever met anyone who reads the Washington Post.

        If one were truly blackpilled, one would see the firings of the Narrative-makers at e.g. Twitter as the Empire‚Äôs ‚Äúsaving throw.‚Äù Stick with me here: People are always asking what‚Äôs to become of all the people thrown out of work by the Robot Revolution. Since we‚Äôre Reality people, when we think about this problem, we think about the average-or-slightly-lower IQ guy who had a good factory job in the 1950s, but is now on the dole.But the AI revolution is putting the Laptop Class out of work equally fast. Musk can fire those people because they did nothing technical; but they can‚Äôt get new jobs because why does any other company need them, when ChatGPT can do their ‚Äújobs‚Äù ‚Äî Narrative Maintenance ‚Äî better than they can, faster, and for free?One traditional method for soaking up excess labor is: Cannon Fodder. And if we‚Äôre going to have a big war with China ‚Äî currently scheduled for Summer 2025, per the Pentagon itself ‚Äî we‚Äôre gonna need a much bigger army. It seems weird ‚Äî the Laptop Class are NOT, to put it mildly, physically fit ‚Äî but consider that the ones scheduling the war are True Believers, who really think that men can become women, and vice versa, just by declaring their pronouns. Why not put them all in the infantry? If Bruce isreallyCaitlyn ‚Äî and of course he is, you haters! ‚Äî then Snowflake Mc iPad reallyisan infantryman; just look at all the army stuff she‚Äôs wearing in her selfies!

            I would suggest that the unfettered importation of ‚Äúfighting age males‚Äù across our Southern border is less about replacing whitey (which may be a side benefit to the elites) but more for stockpiling warm bodies for the upcoming global war.  We‚Äôve probably imported enough hispanics in the last 3 years to sustain at least 2 years of open warfare with China. God knows young white males wont be motivated‚Ä¶and rightfully so.

        Beyond the diminishing returns of complexity, there is also the issues of diversity, distrust, and bad faith actors.The complex society we live in was built under a more homogeneous demographic, high levels of trust and better overall moral behavior.We are taking this hugely complex, intricate machine and substituting in off-brand parts from various sources that were never meant to work together.  The parts are then feeding bad functionality into the system and requiring more maintenance.Overlaying this is the dishonesty and lies that are pervasive under which the system must be maintained.  The elite may now the real score, but the low to mid level managers who must keep the machine running are basing their decisions on outright falsehoods.A severe reduction in complexity is almost inevitable unless certain AI scenarios play out.

        ‚ÄúThey promoted left-wing causes on the editorial side, but the news side was the boring stuff of the news. Today, the entirety of the mass media is engaged in the support of narratives.‚ÄùTwas always so.  Remember Walter Duranty, NYT reporter, dissolute living in Moscow and telling the world that there was no famine in Ukraine?  Robert Conquest detailed it in ‚ÄòHarvest of Sorrow.‚Äô  Duranty‚Äôs Pulitzer has never been rescinded.Then there was  Herbert Matthews, the NYT reporter who invented the mythos of Fidel Castro and happily fed State Dept. propaganda to the culterati.Judith Miller, pushing Cheney‚Äôs lies about yellow cake so Cheney could go on the Sunday talking head shows and push his own narrative that got front paged.  Kristof‚Äôs lies about Steven Hatfill and the anthrax killer.  Jayson Blair.I could go on but you get the point.

            Broken Glass is weirdly one my favorite movies. It‚Äôs just a biopic of Stephen Glass in his time at The New Republic, starring Anakin Skywalker. They highlighted a few of his completely fake stories that were obviously made up, but they fit the narrative, so they weren‚Äôt even fact-checked. As the movie tells it, he only got busted because a reporter at Wired was dressed-down by his bossm wondering why Wired didn‚Äôt break a tech story, so the Wired guy started digging.

        We need to look at Mexico as a decent example of how the culture won‚Äôt be able to support widespread complex systems except for those that seriously impact the elite.

        All these tent poles to prop up this corrupt and debauched empire. You can even see it in the funding sent out to foreign NGOs and others to promote the evil GAE agenda.
Look at this little innocuous tidbit in the news:‚Äò‚Äô Biden administration is offering a $500,000 grant to help teach the English language in Pakistan, in part by providing ‚Äúintensive professional development courses for Pakistani transgender youth.‚Äò‚Äô
Not really that much but imagine different forms times thousands across the globe and you can see an infrastructure being  being developed.

        Reporters also used to come from the dirt people. I remember when every city newspaper had some disheveled townie barfly who would report on petty corruption and the goings-on in the halls of power and in the courts. He got to know contacts over decades. He wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. He had a bias, but he was doing legwork and making calls and hanging around drab buildings.Though back then, college cost about $1000 so even a dirt person who wrote well could join a city newspaper as a cub reporter, eventually becoming a well-known columnist. Nowadays you have to go to J-school and it costs north of $100K, so only the cloud people (or diversity picks) can get a foot in the door. And you know the kind of biases they have, and none of them would dare work for thePittsburgh Post-Gazettefor more than a couple years.

            It will be the Middle East and Central Asia. Afghanistan was the start of the long withdrawal. The GAE is in retreat.

Because we can‚Äôt and we won‚Äôt. All we can do is send arms.As for Taiwan, it will be similar. If China invades, our media will just get the Taiwan pins out and send arms.

        I went to find some specific septic system regulation for my state and came upon a training manual for those hoping to get state certified to do septic work.  125 pages, of septic regs.  It‚Äôs not light reading either as it‚Äôs basically a long list of sentences where the reader can see that at some point someone thought it was a bright idea to install his system under a power pole, or discharge all the storm water runoff through it, etc.  It‚Äôs self-defeating now as getting one installed is now so prohibitively expensive (if it can be done at all) that, as I ‚Äújoke‚Äù, one is better off finding an Amish guy to pay cash to and getting it installed in the middle of the night (backhoe usage would be tricky though).

            where I live there is literally no one available (within a one year out time frame) to do affordable and reliable repairs of a septic, electrical wiring, house painting, roof repair, chimney cleaning or washer repair and they don‚Äôt even call you back to tell you they cannot help you. If I want gravel for my driveway it isn‚Äôt a stretch to saying we might have to break the rocks ourselves. This also contributes to the general deterioration of properties as the older people occupying them can no longer afford or be physically able to do these things. When your 30 year old metal roof rusts through, just throw a blue tarp over it and put a couple tires on top to hold it down.
