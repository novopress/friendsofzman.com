        This may backfire spectacularly.  Of all the lessons Trump has taught us, one of the main ones should be that Americans hate The Media more than all the other boogeymen combined.  Every time he takes a shot at Megyn (god, that stupid Millennial spelling!) Kelly, he gains a few points in the polls.  Thanks to recent Media freakouts, we’re already seeing the end of “racism” and the “-phobias” as viable tactics.  Trump probably gets double-digit support solely from the fact that the Media hates him.  They may end up pushing him past the finish line.

            My guess is the party line, so to speak, will be “Of course Trump is winning his home state and the adjacent states. He’s a liberal! He’ll never win those in the fall.” It’s stupid as Wisconsin is one of the most liberal states in America, but that’s how it goes in PR campaigns.Thinking about it a bit more, I can see them making a big push in PA. It’s a funny state. The east side is Yankee and black. The middle is German and Protestant. The West is Scots-Irish. They could push Kasich in the middle or maybe the East and Cruz in the West.While I remain skeptical of Trump getting the nomination, I’m not sure how they stop him without threatening the very existence of the party.

                I think the party’s toast regardless.  Obviously you can’t read too much into 19th century parallels, but the GOP looks more Whiggish by the minute.  In 1852 they had no reason to exist other than “we’re against the pro-slavery party, but we promise not to mention slavery either.”  A brokered convention candidate ends up like Winfield Scott, losing to a ridiculous nonentity like Franklin Pierce (himself the 16th (or whatever) choice of the Dem convention, because nobody wanted to talk about slavery in the Democratic Party, either).  Paul Ryan loses to Hillary Clinton, and then the new party — an openly white nationalist party — sweeps up all the disaffected Trump voters, *and* all the disaffected Sanders voters, with their…. well, let’s just call it a “Boer” platform.  And then the shooting starts. (Much as I think he’s a despicable clown, Trump really is the lesser of a lot of evils… Trump 2016, damn it).

                    Good points.The Cuckservative Party has proven itself so important to the degrading game of progressive democracy that were it banned outright and we conducted politics in a transparently corrupt one party state then, at least, the  soul would have space left for itself, and Progressives would have no beard.The problem is not that the Republican Party is not doing the right thing, but that universal suffrage does not permit discussion of what that is. There is every reason to think this will get worse, and that the process is accelerating. North Carolina just lost 400 PayPal jobs because they declined to check yes on  transgender choice in their toilets. Optimism is cowardice.

                        I’ll know a politician is serious — and the civil war is about to start — when I hear him talk about voting reform.  Like that true American hero, President Dwayne Herbert Mountain Dew Camacho, I have a 3 point plan that would eliminate most of our problems.  The following 3 groups are hereby disenfranchised: those on public assistance; employees of any government at any level; serving military members.  You get your vote back when you go off the dole or go private sector.

                If Trump had won the states that Cruz recently won, we’d be hearing about Trump’s “white supremacist supporters”. When Cruz wins them, he’s just popular with regular folks. And the other thing I find odd is that Cruz is running as the evangelical candidate.  Yet the “conservative” bloggers supporting him are neutral on religion at best.

        Cruz hired the Bush finance team, including Neil Bush. Phil Gramm is his economic advisor. Lindsay Graham basically endorsed Cruz. He is as establishment as they come. His wife Heidi works for Goldman Sachs and also worked in the Bush administration.
Read up a bit about Cruz on TPP/TPA.  You might also want to check his actual voting record as a Senator. He has a record he could run on, if he’d actually done anything. And as always, follow the money and see who owns him.

        Z is lumping the anti-Trump factions together, as if it’s all an orchestration of liberal neo-cons like Kristol and other left wing retreads from the 1960s.  In fact, of course there is a wide swath of anti-Trump voters that dislike Trump for traditional, paleocon reasons, including his support for abortion on demand, special rights for the gaystapo, his general alignment with cultural degradation and NYC filth, etc.   Trump’s long history of bankrolling the Democratic Party also unsettles people too, not just the Bill Kristols of the world.

            I can live with Trump’s rather checkered past on the abortion issue because let’s face it, the President simply has no real bearing on the issue. It’s a legitimate concern for SCOTUS nominees or local politicians; at the Presidential level it’s irrelevant. As far as bankrolling Democrats, frankly, I’d expect him to do that as someone doing business in real estate development in NYC. He eventually became a Republican, so why hold it against him? Everyone forgets that Reagan was a registered Democrat up until the 1960s. And saying that Trump is aligned with “general degradation and filth” is pretty hyperbolic. Sure he knows how to have a good time, and even though he’s been through a couple of wives, they still seem to like him and he obviously has wonderful children who love him and frankly is a much better family man than Reagan ever was.Of course Bill Kristol would like you to forget those annoying similarities with Reagan since he is an Archbishop in the High Church of Reagan Conservatism. Maybe you aren’t old enough to remember that back in 1976 and 1980, Reagan was being tarred with the same “phony conservative” brush as Trump is now; but that didn’t stop him from winning the nomination and beating Carter like a gong. No, what Kristol is really afraid of is the fact that Trump has no use for beltway “Conservatives” like him, who make a wonderful living being the ineffectual Loyal Opposition to the gradual progressive takeover of the Former USA.

        Don’t quite get all the disrespect for Cruz here. He’s no establishment guy, smart as hell, wants limited government, and is a bit devious, which equips him well for Washington. I’d say a lot less devious than Trump who has shafted every shareholder who ever invested with him. Tim

            Cruz simply doesn’t stand up to any level of scrutiny. First, he’s not even eligible to be POTUS, having been born in Canada to a Cuban father and a mother who may or may not have declared herself to be a Canadian citizen at the time of Cruz’ birth. If it’s the former, he’s arguably not even a U.S. Citizen! And by sealing his birth records, he hasn’t helped himself in this regard. And it gets worse from there. He’s a religious weirdo, just do a little digging on his oddball brand of Protestantism. He was a mid level Bush administration bureaucrat and Texas prosecutor who got in front of the Tea Party parade to get to the Senate; he’s a weasel who carefully nuances his positions and leaves himself convenient back doors in order to create the appearance of ideological purity when he’s really just a poser and political careerist. He’s accomplished absolutely nothing of substance in his life, most people he’s worked with find him a disagreeable weirdo, he has cheated on his wife with beltway social climbers as well as prostitutes, and he’s funny looking. But other than all that, he’s a great guy.

            If what I read a couple of weeks ago is correct, then I can explain Kasich.  Apparently, if Kasich drops out then under Ohio rules all of his delegates would go to the runner-up – Trump.  If that’s true, then the GOPe will keep funding Kasich’s run right up until the convention if that’s what it takes to keep Trump from reaching 1,237 delegates.  It would certainly explain why he’s still running because his only purpose from the get-go was to split the anti-¡Jeb! Ohio vote so that El Gobernador would win in a squeaker.I just hope that Kasich is bleeding them white in return for agreeing to stay in the race – private jets, 5 star hotels, dinners at Spago’s, the works.  At least the money so squandered isn’t going to attack ads or to fund the latest anti-Trump screeds from Conservative, Inc.

                But isn’t that why candidates generally “suspend” their campaigns, instead of dropping out– to retain control of their hard-won delegates at the convention and use them as a bargaining chip? By that logic, the GOPe would simply save the money and tell Kasich to suspend his campaign. It seems to me Kasich actually thinks he can position himself as a convention compromise candidate if he can stay in the race and win a few more states. Which he won’t of course, but you can’t blame him for trying.

            From everything I read, Trump is a bit of a tightwad by nature. He’s also used to running private ventures where you relentlessly cut costs. For example, he holds his rallies at airports because it saves money on transportation and security.
Maybe he learned a lesson in WI. He was outspent there at least 10-to-1. Time will tell.

                Outspent for sure.  I live in Crapstone, WI.  To the extent that I watched any TV or listened to radio: all Cruz. &amp; Bernie &amp; Hitlery.  Maybe one Trump ad. also, the local talk radio dudes are all railing against Trump. To be fair, they have been doing that since last summer, so not likely bought off by Soros, as some suggest. To the otherwise uninterested &amp; tuned out citizenry, Trump got himself defined in WI.  He will need to spend some media $$$ sometime.  If folks would have read his 1990 Playboy interview, they would find he is quite consistent in his views over time.  He is not especially modest.  They will also hear a guy who says what’s on his mind and really is proud of his country. He attracts &amp; takes hits, and then hits back hard, every time.http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-04-01/trumps-1990-playboy-interview-we-are-being-laughed-around-worldHe would be a remarkable contrast to all the bowing &amp; apologizing in the current administration.

Upper Midwesterners find his personality type very off-putting, and it isn’t clear to me that could be fixed with any amount of ad spend. When Scott Walker endorsed Cruz, that seemed a very bad sign for Trump’s chances. Maybe Trump decided to play the long game, and let Wisconsin be the place where he forced his opponents to spend a huge amount of money to gain relatively few delegates.
