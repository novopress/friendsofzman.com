        I’ve noticed a similar dynamic in economics; the main way for an economist to become influential/well-known/a “public intellectual” i.e. Keynes. Friedman, etc., is to offer politicians an intellectual justification to do what they wanted to do anyway

        I’ve been observing the career of Amy Schumer with morbid fascination.  A decade ago she was a regular guest on the old XM Opie &amp; Anthony show. Back then she portrayed herself as tough, completely non-PC comic.  She was able to hold her own in rough banter with people like Jim Norton and Patrice Oneal.  She made me laugh on occasion.I assume somebody in Hollywood offered her a gigantic amount of money to sell out, reveal who her uncle is, and go full-PC-retard.  Or else she decided to drop the act and be herself.  Either way, she’s no longer funny, just annoying.

            She was the one on those Bud Light election commercials, right?  Frikkin’ bizzaro ads, they were.  Could not figure out why anyone would want to buy a beer after seeing that.

        A very interesting insight about the Cloud zeitgeist during the period of the GW Bush election.  I remember the time well.  The Boomer Progs. were steadily advancing, their ecosystem of studies, commissions, NGO’s, grants, etc. was being staffed and funded left and right. Predatory sex by Cloud Alpha Males was officially validated (so long as they affirmed and fully funded feminism), etc.Then, all of a sudden in Nov 2000, the astroid hit, GWB was elected, another, earlier, great, “NOOOO_!!!,” echoed throughout the Cloud. So they made Gladwell rich when he re-assured them that any day now, their ship of full control would arrive right after The Tipping Point was reached.Yet the strange thing is, in domestic affairs, GWB didn’t defund any of their many, many projects and added others.  All he did was steady-state them, which in Cloud speak is a cruel beltway cut from their rightful 2x GDP growth rate.AND, in foreign policy, he made them look bad at Davos: Cheap shots from smug EUpers stung them ever so sharply.   And so they hated and hoped.  And THEN, in 2008, the rainbow reappeared in the form of the Magical Mulatto to resume all things good: Not a tranny studies grant went unfunded, barely a community went un-organized, no transfer payment went unpaid.And yet things tipped another direction (for now).  So, is Gladwell’s growing, well deserved, obscurity a favorable omen_?

                Right.  And yet they hate GWB to this day.  Sort of like Nixon who gave them a lot of what they said they wanted (NEA, EPA, etc.).Re Gladwell, I reread the transcript of that slobbering podcast (you were right).  He strikes me as an amiable mid-wit who got lucky and knows it at some level.  He’d have been a regular at the Paris Salons before the French Revolution.  Apparently that role is still open in a revised and far more profitable form.  I think that the salon guys only got a free lunch and a shot at Madam’s boudoir instead of $40k a crack of stockholder money so that Cloud CEO’s could look hip.

                    Re joint venture: True.  But by contrast, look how well the Malignant Mulatto did.  It’s almost as though O was serious about his spending (despite claiming the contrary in ’08) and W was not serious about not spending (despite claiming the contrary in 00).  And I say this despite still liking W as a man.

        ‘Blink’ was the only really interesting Gladwell book, and was apolitical….Gladwell should have stuck with that kind of thing. When he got into more intellectual matters, especially the Blank Slate nonsense, he was way over his head.

        Amy Schumer has NEVER been funny except to people in love with “stupid slut comedic gags” told by a politically-connected, fat, unattractive and insecure Jewish girl from Manhattan’s tony Upper Eastside who confirms/validates the audience’s Northeast US liberal establishment beliefs and values.  Like the great majority of modern female comedians, she plays the role of stupid slut to confirm to her audience it is okay not to use judgment in your daily life but demand that life still owes you happy outcomes, rainbows and butterflies, a distinctly sad failing of modern feminism.  Her success mirrors that of other successful female comedians and writers these days, e.g. Lena Dunham, Whitney Cummings, etc.  They all come from privileged backgrounds, have never worked a real job a day of their adult lives and were set up in their entertainment roles by family friends and relatives.  They all make money by playing the role of victim of the (usually white) male.

        Samantha Bee is 100 on the  annoyingness scale. A stricter enforcement of the immigration laws woul perhaps have kept her out. I don’t get the attraction- she’s not attractive, not funny? Whom did she “you know what” to get her job?
In a similar vein, I saw the Book of Mormon  on Broadway. I was prepared to like it- I’m a South Park fan. Very disappointing. Parker and Stone merely  pandered to the prejudices of their liberal NY audience. I hold out hope  that it has all been a cynical ploy by those two scamps.

                Holy crap – you watched the show?  I get annoyed with all of her ads during Seinfeld reruns.  I’m trying to relax after work and then some spinster comes on my TV and starts screeching at me.

            Pandering, got that right. It’s all tasteless and lacking in substance and class because none of it would be possible without a collective deep underlying river of contempt and envy for the dirt people. Because if I’m no mistaken, it is directed at us dirt people in one shape or form.Seems like it is predicated on another form of using media as a vehicle for the purpose of insulting and degrading dirt people. It’s no less fake than the agitprop and narrative of the fake media.I saw Whoopy Goldberg in a dive bar near Kenworth Station back around like 82′ I think. She was hilarious, make you hurl you laugh so hard funny. There wasn’t a stitch of PC or marxist signaling. It was down to earth in the gutter every day dirt people humor. Always made me wonder who she sold her soul to. You can’t be that kind of funny without understanding the honest nature of honest people. But you got to be some kind of sociopath to become an act the purpose of which is to brain wash and socially engineer millions of people.She was no fake when I sat 5 feet from her watching her routine. I see her on TV, well used to, threw that hideous contraption in the trash, and it is so contrived it makes me sick.

            Ditto here.  Tried to watch an episode. It was awful.  If my goal was simply to be screeched at by a 40-something blonde I’d prefer to just piss off my wife.  At least in the latter case there is the possibility of make-up sex at the end.

        I have watched Tyler Cowen’s intellectual descent with some amusement over the last 3 years.  That conversation with Gladwell reached new depths of intellectual mutual masturbation, however.I keep hoping that all of it is some sort of master-of-self-parody act, but I know that isn’t.  At one time, about 7-8 years ago, Cowen was one of the most consistently interesting and provocative economics writers out there, but at some point he sold his soul, and one can pretty much mark that point when he started writing opeds forThe New York Times.  What a loss, and I now feel a bit embarrassed at having been amused by it, too.

        I agree, there is no taste for Gladwell in today’s dark and angry Cloud World. “Delightful,” pseudo-insightful rumination will not do. Hence, DeRay Mckesson and Leslie Jones, the Cult’s new gibberish-spouting idiots.
Footnote: Randy Moss hated to practice and did his best to avoid it. Ditto Alan Iverson. Sorry, Malcolm. Talent— that’s the bottom line.

        Gladwell also was – and possibly still is – a very highly paid shill for the tobacco and pharma big corporates (see here:http://exiledonline.com/malcolm-gladwell-unmasked-a-look-into-the-life-work-of-america’s-most-successful-propagandist/)
