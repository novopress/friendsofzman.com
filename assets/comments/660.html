        seems like youâ€™re taking on a lion position with endorsing rationed healthcare and hastening of death to relive the burden on society.

        Yes, Pollack is firmly reaching towards discovering the obvious.  However, I consider his efforts to be basically the perpetration of a fraud.  He already knows the truth you describe.In recent weeks, you have seen an explosion of essays/studies/ruminations from the left about how so much is spent on the sick and dying that not much is left to be spent for all the other people who might actually visit a polling place in November.  For apparatchiks like Pollack, it is just soul-crushing to see this great addition to the rolls of Medicaid going on for the ACA implementation, and knowing those people will have an even greater problem accessing health care because so much of the money gets spent the much smaller numbers of people are are actually sick and/or dying.
