        Spectacularly insightful.  I’m old and I’ve recognized what Zman is observing for some time.  But without the ability to so cogently explain it.
Happy to know Zman is moving someplace that will be better for him.  The man is a treasure.

        My son is a chemical and biomedical engineer.  He talked some years back about micro plastics and the effect on humans.  More and more news is coming out on this problem.  There is little to nothing that can be done.
This clearly could be the trigger.

        There is a coming colossal wave of firings in Corporate America. Citi announced layoffs already involving 20,000 people, expect this to accelerate. Of course, it will only be for YT. Not the diverse.The reason is AI. Most of Corporate C Suite have been convinced that AI (dumb and woke as can be) can do the jobs of those actually competent that don’t involve actual skilled physical labor. And even those are being cut to the bone, see all the railroad derailments due to cuts in crews and maintenance. So all the marketing, finance, accounting, etc. people will be replaced with AI. Same with the engineering, developers, etc.The AI will fail of course, but it is currently being heavily subsidized like Uber in its early days by VC. After a year or two of spectacular failures the AI will get very expensive, and even more woke/non-functional. In the meantime …All those fired people will have no jobs in the legal economy. No means of earning a living. The impact on sudden and permanent downward mobility of most Whites is yet to be factored in. They won’t fire Jamail from DEI Coordination, it will be Ellen in Accounting.

        Meanwhile if the “Conservative Treehouse”  is any indicator many are waiting for Trump to be elected and set things right.    Within one week he said:He approves of the way Israel is dealing with the Gazans.   “You have to finish the problem.”He believes we should forgive Budweiser.He again stated that we were lucky to have him as president because without him the covid vax would have taken much longer to bring to market thereby not saving millions of lives.So even if elected we will get no help from Trump.   It is obvious he will be working for the same Thugs that have ruled us for a long time.

            His character is The Boss, so he says boss-like things. It goes wrong when he decides to show other bosses that he’s the boss of his voters.
Conservatives love it, the sound of mister MAGA™ betraying normal Americans. No one will ever represent you losers! HAHA!
His marginal loss of favor among white men is because of it. Left alone he’d squander all their support. But his being persecuted offsets that, makes #onlyTrump necessary. The system can’t accept mere victory.
We’re stuck with him.

                What scares me is that many young men idolize Trump.  If he gave the call to go fight Hezbollah and Iran for Israel many would believe him and respond.

        Off topic:  People have different and often incompatible explanations about how politics works.  For this reason, I take notice when someone makes a prediction about politics that can be evaluated, because it allows us to judge that person’s explanation.A recent example of such a prediction was Jared and Derb believing that the  hostility to the chosen by non-whites, whom most non-whites see as white, would cause the chosen to abandon their promotion of anti-white policies.  You can be the judge of the accuracy of that prediction.Even more recently, the normies conservative critics of woke Hollywood movies are rejoicing because they believe that the free market has forced corporate America to surrender its wokeness because of “go woke, go broke.”  If you’re curious, here are a few entertaining examples:Doomcock “DEI is DIE on Wall Street | Corporate America REJECTING DEI Initiatives | BIG Changes Coming!”https://youtu.be/NCsimzRJXJw?t=55Nerdrotic “How Bad Can It Get For Woke Hollywood?”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seqLH-V4u2s&amp;t=614sI don’t think that I’m oversimplifying their position to say that they believe that because the movie makers have lost so much money on woke movies, then the makers have been taught a lesson about the free market and have no choice but to make movies that the critics like.  That’s the part of the explanation that can be observed.These likable critics believe that most people are motivated by maximizing profits most of the time.  Therefore, now that the market failure of woke movies has been sufficiently demonstrated, the movie makers will stop pushing wokeness because it’s bad for the bottom line.I disagree with them that personal greed is the strongest motivator in the case of the big movie makers and big investment companies.  I believe that these groups have not given up on wokeness at all because it is a religious crusade for them.  They have just concluded that they pushed a little too hard too soon and must dial it back long enough for the critics to return to playing with their superhero figurines.I like these critics but they are in denial about the fundamental anti-whiteness of our elites and most non-whites.

            I don’t think it’s necessarily a deeply held religious zeal as much as that they gain social standing in their group by producing anti-white material.I remember going to Washington DC with my parents a long time ago and we were taking the bus to Mount Vernon and my mom wasn’t sure which stop we needed.  All the blacks refused to respond or say anything, in keeping with the surly attitude we’d experienced the entire trip.  (Portland may be a clown show but we do have nicer jungle bunnies)  Anyways, it was only when there was only one black lady left on the bus then she told us which stop we needed.  So their attitude was driven by peer pressure, none of the blacks wanted to lose face in front of the other blacks by being polite to a white person.I have to assume Jews are operating under the same peer pressure.  Like I would bet a million shekels that Ben Shapiro, when he’s only among other Jews, has to reassure them all that his judeochristianity shtick is just a big con to fleece the goys otherwise he’d lose social standing for associating himself with Christians.

                Many moderns are uncomfortable with religion, a product of our secular culture.The word “and” applies in this analysis. It’s religion and standing. I am a practicing Catholic and will vouch for the truth of my religion. It does not change that it’s practiced on a fallen planet and even the sincere seek status and to fit in.

            I’ve been in marketing and advertising for over a decade.  If it was all about money, they’d put tall white men and women in all the advertising and movie plots.  Research shows consistently that white  consumers spend the most money in the West and these people prefer to see others who look like them on screen.  Our Afrocentric music and movie industry is all top down propaganda.  In a strange way, social media is providing alternatives to this  but a lot of damage has been done.

                Yes, you can see the change in the 1960’s towards “The Message”. Suddenly there is at least one black in every crowd. It could be to justify selling to blacks, but more than likely it’s to get across early wokeness without impacting sales that much.

        Spot on Z regarding the quality of people. There no longer is any “quality” to be found. Moving from western NY to south Florida in the past six months, was a real eye opener, I experienced extreme “culture shock.” I thought most people were shit where I’m from, they are amazing by comparison.There are no rules of the road, no common courtesy here.If you’re at a stop light and going straight, they’ll make a right on red from the left turning lane, in front of your car. First time I saw it blew my mind! They flatly refuse to hold their lane, they’ll drive head on at you, as if playing chicken. So I just abruptly move into their lane and play chicken, then they seem to wake the F up and move over. Turn signals are rare, cops don’t even use them!So called customer service personnel, and this a tourist economy down here, are extremely rude and let it be known you are annoying them with your very presence. Then expect a fat tip! Laughable. I think you did a down on tipping Z if I’m not mistaken. I mean whether U.S.A. is a service economy right? Only jobs left for the dirt people, well these “ customer service” folk are the definition of dirt!Everyone’s playing an angle to separate you from your hard earned cash. Skilled tradesmen are a joke! And I am one. I make a killing. Because I show up every day on time and do quality work. They love you just for showing up.They hate northern transplants, but the biz owners love us, because of  the work ethic and actually doing quality work. Nothing but homeless, panhandlers, hookers, druggie burn outs, oddly interspersed amongst the uber wealthy. Bizarre!These people as my boss who’s from NYC, joke all the time are dumb as F!As for AI, the bizarre fascination for it, people are too stupid or too concerned about their latest social media post, where their next six pack is coming from, or their next bag of weed to even contemplate what the fallout is going to be.You can shove AI where the sun doesn’t shine!Good luck in your new digs Z, you’re in gods country. Say hello to Tim Pool for me! 😂

            South Florida certainly has the worst drivers in AINO, you are not wrong to complain about that. Possibly also the rudest people in AINO, although there is more competition for that title. It is a unique place. Distinct both from the rest of the world and the rest of Florida. Sometimes I miss the weather. But I don’t really miss much else about it.
Someone once told me if you want to stay sane while living there you need to take 2 or 3 vacations a year. I think they were right.

            If one believes this is all a “game”, then the decline in oil production is simply a ruse.  For example, OPEC has limited production to keep prices high—but not too high.  Of course, Russia is able to produce much more than now doing. Biden stopped pipelines and other aspects of production and delivery.  Canada likewise with oil shale production.  Of course, Venezuela has all sorts of sanctions and are in political turmoil.  They sit on a lot of oil, albeit a poorer grade.So perhaps we are producing less, but there’s not real shortage of oil here or abroad—but there is a shortage of political will—and there lies the problem.  I’m sure a second Biden term that doubles gas prices will be exactly what the Lefties dream of.

                Opec does not have an infinite stock of oil to Tap.
The only country that come close to that state is Saudi Arabia, which has a stock much larger than their income needs (at present anyway) – so they have extraordinary production flexibility – which gives them some market price setting power.
Even so, they have a finite stock and not unlimited flexibility.

        It just so happens that this week I finally got around to watching Idiocracy. I probably don’t have anything to say about it that hasn’t already been said. That movie is kind of a rorschasch test. People see in it the stupid that they want to see.Absent the Camp of the Saints style invasion which we’re currently experiencing, the Mind Virus would be a much more immediate and debilitating problem than declining IQ (which is happening rather slowly, aside from the “border”). Unlike the effects of IQ decline, which are a gradual and largely unrecognized decay, the effects of the Mind Virus manifest instantly, in the broadest possible way. See 2020. Or 2008. Or 2001. And even supposedly smart people fall prey to it, in huge numbers. The Mind Virus should kill us or collapse us long before declining IQ ever gets a chance. Except that we have this situation in which the Mind Virus compels the Camp of the Saints. So it becomes a closer race between which one will get us first. Have a nice day.

        Aww, Zman, you had to mention natgas.  Turning natgas into gasoline, that is.So there I was in the outlands below Midlands, TX.I was able to count 31 burnoff stacks just from where I sat.Each one, I figured, was as big as millions, or tens of millions, of pilot lights.(It’s to keep the sheer pressure underground from rupturing the pipelines.)There is no reason our nation shouldn’t be 1000% energy independent.This is something a Crown corporation should be kickstarting; if we can spend the sums on the DoD and State and their evil experiments, we can develop out own sovereign resources instead.(Send the royalty checks to the heritage citizens only, or to the taxpayers only to end the Federal Reserve and taxes on income!  We should be borrowing against our own accounts, not debt bondage by inflationary.fiat scrip.)

            I doubt it can be sold for less than it costs.  Knew someone who did environmental at BP Whiting,  and another who did engineering management at 5he same facility,  and when I asked about it, laughed at me. They were right.  At 22 l per mole, and a mole of ethane being 32 g, there is not enough energy to bother with.
I get that it looks like they are leaving a crapton of money on the table,  but run the math.

                    Nothing is replacing the internal combustion engine. It’s all an exercise in self masterbation.
High compression ratios, long duration, high lift camshafts,Healthy breathing cylinder heads, in normally aspirated applications, or for real power,Positive displacement, roots style superchargers “blowers.”Nothing delivers more bang for the energy dollar… Nothing!

                        Look up top alcohol classes in drag racing, or sprint car racing.I’d prefer high octane gasoline, but if you want 100% renewable fuel, you have it in corn!For fucks sake, pure grain alcohol has been used in racing for at least 80 years.I’m not talking about shitty half assed E85 blends.Just run ICE motors on alcohol.No drilling, fracking or any other bullshit.I’m all for drilling and fracking,But if the governments or PTB,we’re serious about solving energy problems, and fossil fuels are evil and rare, just run god damned grain alcohol from easily grown and renewable corn.Corn is THE only renewable, economically useful energy source.Corn, cubes, and a blower are all you need.

            Yep, I tell my kids all the time “for 100+ years we used to just burn that shit off instead of find a way to use it.”
The suicide cult isn’t going to allow us to be energy independent.
I’m starting to think that we need some sort of way to get the suicide cult to actually commit mass suicide by the millions.
Think how cheap housing would get if all the self-loathing lefties killed themselves.

            Most of those wells in that are taking their associated natural gas to process plants.  They could have been flaring because the plant is down or the pipeline had not been built to the well site yet.   It’s a good revenue stream and they would prefer to take that metbane, ethane , propane, butane and on to a plant for processing.

        “Our society started getting dumber about the middle of the last century.”
The GI Bill leapt us into space, transistors, and computers.
Little known or mentioned, something else happened.We want smart girls for to marry smart guys and have smart kids, right?Sounds good on paper.
We not only offered GI Bill education to men…We expanded college funding programs for young women in the 50s, too.Then, we boosted that a decade later for Affirmative Action; the child-bearing half of our population was an oppressed minority.
The rest, well…you know.  But, it sounded good on paper.

            I neglected to mention you had to qualify for the GI Bill.Most men didn’t serve, so their selection process was the trades, and to be vetted by other men who knew you.

        Speaking of Prison Reform DA Alvin Bragg’s buddy, a released convict, was arrested for murdering and dismembering another ex-con he knew in prison. The dude’s supporters were out in force at his arraignment. [Yes, he’s b-l-a-c-k yall and yes he wore a blonde wig when disposing of the body to avoid surveillance. That’s super-villain levels of intelligence.]Now we have Biden announcing last night that the US will build a port in Gaza using floating docks to offload massive amounts of food into Gaza. There are promises there will be no boots on the ground guaranteeing of course, boots on the ground as Marines and Army provide security port-side. Which in turn guarantees Hamas hugging that security while firing rockets at Israelis. Which in turn guarantees US-Israeli conflict. Even someone like Jake Sullivan knows this, but likely Hunter and Dr. Jill over-ruled him. The Javanka problem squared.Stupidity squared, in order to woo back Muslim voters in Michigan, this will certainly alienate “other” voters and more importantly, donors/organizers/oligarchs by June at the latest. The stupidity at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is simply stunning.

                        Andrew Anglin put up a post entitled ” A Total Revaluation of the 2024 Election” over at the Unz Review on March 8 that is worth a read.
He points out that Trump may have made a deal with Netanyahu that he can be President if he greenlights Nakhba II. Trump told Fox News on Tuesday that Israel should “finish the job”; if that’s not a greenlight, I don’t know what is. Since Trump has already kissed the (((ring))) in innumerable ways, why not on this?

        Remember that line from the early Z-blog era?Maybe the greatest line about Silicon Valley ever.
The techies were telling war stories.One of our stalwarts said, “…and no meeting was truly over, until someone was crying and somebody else threw a stapler across the room!”

        The criminal problem is being made infinitely worse by the “smart fraction” who think prisons are evil and the source of criminality.  These people will actually try to explain to you how prisons cause crime.  Even the ones who don’t believe this believe criminals just need a hug and that what we need more of is social workers.  Many of the big cities in America now have prosecutors who will not prosecute crime.  In NYC, one of the worst offenders in this respect wants to put national guardsmen in train stations and on the trains to “randomly” search passengers and their bags.  They want to create a police state to solve the problem they themselves caused.“Mass culture” is probably at least part of the reason for the ideologically dumbing down of even smart people. Everyone is exposed to the same mass culture. Even the smart fraction believes incredibly silly things.  A lot of these bad ideas/bad ideology were well entrenched by the time society started dumbing down through falling IQ and immigration from Central and South America.  In some cases, like mass 3rd world immigration, the falling IQ is a direct result of the dumb ideology.  “Smart people” with dumb ideas are almost as bad as dumb people.

                Regardless of the extent to which prisons fail to prevent crime or fail to sufficiently punish to deter crime, it is irrefutable that prisons are not the primary cause of crime.They usually mean it very convoluted and retarded ways.  Like if you commit crimes and have felony convictions, it makes it harder to find legitimate work and forces people into crime through economic necessity.  Or the old “my daddy was in prison and that’s why I’m a criminal” chain of causation.  As if living with your criminal father is somehow conducive to raising productive members of society.The most infuriating part about all this is these SJWs will get in front of a camera and say “nobody knows why crime fell off a cliff in the 90s”  They don’t know why, but they know for sure the one thing that did not cause it was a whole generation of criminals being in prison for a long time.They don’t need a hug. They don’t need 15th chances. They don’t need “programs” or anger management or training or any other retarded SJW non-solution.  They need decades in prison first offense, second offense at the most.

                    Tars: “…prisons are not the primary cause of crime.”I can prove that used to be true.  I had a co-driver, an old guy, who’d spent many years in for manslaughter.He said back in the day the guards wore suits and ties; they mixed freely with the convicts inside, and didn’t even carry a gun.Everybody in was required to stay shaved and get a haircut monthly.  Cells were clean, no noisy or gang rape allowed.  (That would bring long suffering and eventually lethal consequences.)He and other old birds have told me they were friends with the guards.  “Good morning, Sam, isn’t it your daughter’s birthday today” kind of chats.The convicts, and the guards, everybody considered it a job; the guards were just co-workers at the job.It all started to change as the laws were liberalized.Aryan Brotherhood – the Hell’s Angels of the prison world at that time- formed to protect White prisoners in Florida; 98% of the rapes were black on White.Now…filthie is right.  Prison is Basic for military cadres.It’s crime school, with tranny women and heavy drugs supplied by the government, and everybody gets raped.

                        You have to commit a crime (in most cases) to actually to go to prison.  You are confusing a secondary effect for the primary effect.Worse still, in most US cities you have to commit a ton of crime before you will ever see the inside of a state prison.  Plus, unless you are killing people, as a juvenile, it is very difficult to end up in prison.  Many, if not most of the guys who end up in prison, they have a long (but sealed) juvenile record as well.I am most certainly not saying our prisons are great. They’re not. But they are NOT the primary cause of crime.  Our failure to enforce the law and put these men in prison for long stretches is the primary problem.  Now it has bled into the high schools. Where disciplining out of control kids is “racist” and so the only thing they learn is that despite all the threats, there are little to no consequences for not following the rules.What good are “good” prisons if criminals are not being sent to them?  Almost nobody is getting caught the first time they commit crime and they’re not being sent to prison the first time they get caught.

                    Prison can be very effective. Most major crimes are committed by a very small number of people. Locking those people away for a long time solves a lot of problems. Of course, that will never happen under the current “administration”.

        The big problem all you olds have is that while you may have a lot of money and can afford to retire, that little niggling issue of millennials all being lazy emotionally unstable retards is still going to follow you.  Once the diabeetus really kicks into gear you get the joys of dealing with the millennials working in the health care system.  Once the alzheimer’s kicks in you get millennial caregivers.  Even if you don’t get crippled you still probably need help with home repairs and yardwork and guess who is available?Recently I got hit with a gout attack and tennis elbow but I had a downed tree I needed to get cleaned up so I made the mistake of hiring a young white guy who was job hunting but needed some cash.  I still got more done than him literally hopping on one foot, every time I turned away he went back to his phone, he assumed that me taking him out to lunch was on the clock, and every day he’d crap out within a few hours and was surprised that his total hours didn’t amount to that much at the end.  The experience was like hiring a teenager except this guy is like 30.“hey we should hire white guys” is a good idea in principle but compare the guy above to the Mexican guy twice his age that I normally pester when I need help.  Gets 4x as much done in the same amount of time, has actual skill in safely downing trees, and I have to force him to take more money than he thinks he’s owed.Blame the millennials for being pathetic or blame the boomers for raising them to be pathetic either way, but it isn’t a good situation in which we find ourselves.

                Most of the residential building around where I live is done by Amish or Mennonites.  Most of the agricultural jobs are held by what the locals refer to as “Mexicans,” regardless of their actual place-of-origin.  They work hard and are a net “plus” to the comunity.  Outside of firearms-related crimes, the two biggest sources of criminal activity are drug related offenses and sex crimes, mostly perpetrated by native whites and imported negroes.  Breaking that down, the whites are responsible for nearly all of the drug use and pedophilia (straight and homo) and the imported negroes (i.e., drifters from Philadelphia and New Jersey, mostly) are the drug suppliers and shooters.  There are, of course, outliers, but generally speaking, that’s the breakdown.  So far, we have managed to avoid any sizable influx of invaders from across the southern “border.”  Whether that remains so is yet to be determined.

                Don’t the Amish typically stop school at the 8th grade and go into a trade?  I suspect that prevents the kinds of situations you see in say Starbucks where the Ph.D. in English Literature doesn’t feel truly invested in his career of putting ice in a cup.

                Attrition. We’re constantly bombarded by negative energy that is focused on us. Every other demographic, and even our own, project their flaws and poor luck onto us. This can wear a man down over time. Our younger women resemble grandmothers with Leonid Brezhnev eyebrows and booger farms in their noses. Courage, grace and beauty are diminishing rapidly. Sad devolution.

        In light of the big picture presented in today’s podcast, a seminal question needs to be addressed. Can we fix what’s broken through reasoning, education, persuasion, grassroots mobilization, and modern civil-societal remedies; i.e. voting harder?Let’s look at the recent example of Ukraine. In 2019, Ukrainians elected Zelensky on a platform of seeking peace with Russia. Did that outcome occur? HELL NO IT DIDN’T. And now millions of average Ivans (normal white guys) are dead or seriously wounded, and this resource is gone forever (as well as their DNA). Can Ukraine rebuild itself without competent white guys to propel its industry and agriculture?Can a similar outcome arise in the West? Can the West survive economically without pillaging Russia and Ukraine resources (which was the whole goal of Project Ukraine)? If the West goes into economic collapse, what can be expected to occur (especially in light of all the illegal invaders currently diffused into those Western countries)? Will there be violent civil unrest and consequent casualties? When the smoke clears, will there be enough competent white guys left to rebuild from the ashes?Sleepwalking into the future on hopium is not a solution to anything. A return to “survival of the fittest” may soon be upon us once again. Be fit or be dead.

            As Ralph Wiggam would say, “I’m helping”. Actually the news yesterday was that the US would be building some kind of aid-pier (AIDS-pier?) in Gaza from which they could unload “humanitarian aid” to the Gazans, in other words, Hamas. So, yes, we’re helping Israel *and* its enemies. At least that was the story I heard. It makes no sense but then nothing the Bidenbots do does.

        Our elites deny parts of objective reality (race, sex) and they encode that denial into their AI, which prevents the software from having an accurate model of reality.
Let’s watch for the differences between what AI is programmed to believe and what is reality.  For example, if the AI has an encoded assumption that all races have the same abilities then there is no reason not to build an important factory in Somalia.  The AI is programmed to dismiss the actual reasons that this is a terrible idea.  We may be able to exploit that delta.

            I think it’s worse than that. As I understand the LLM concept, the “knowledge” the AI has cannot be located precisely in some piece of code. It’s spread throughout the vast matrices that comprise the neural network that drives the responses. The only way to create a fully pozzed AI is to VERY carefully curate the training data. Basically, you need to create an alternate reality for it. This means that slow stupid humans become a “filter” for its data about the world. No matter how automated the initial data gathering is, there’s going to be this bottleneck made of dumb college girls and soybois. People who want “real AI” are going to be willing to pay for ones that don’t have the filter. I suspect even the ruling elite, at least the smarter factions, will want this as much as we would. A clear window on the world is better than a rose tinted one even if it shows you things you don’t like. Currently, the Gab AIs are pretty close to being unfiltered. One the other hand, this may mean a way to find jobs for all the useless college girls made redundant by AI. The sensible thing to do, sending them home and telling them to have some kids, will be the last thing they try.

                Good point.  It seems like a good premise for a dissident novel would be an executive, who has never questioned the narrative of our elite, who buys a “real” AI and gets taught by it about how the world really is.  Imagine the shock and the anger at being lied to.  Suddenly he understands the danger he is in due to his disagreements with the narrative, which all of us live with.

                    Philip K Dick’s “The Penultimate Truth” is a non-computer version of that story, and it strongly resembles the future our rulers say they want—and have made some big, open moves to create. It’s an old book, so it’s well-written. Recommended.I don’t think the existence of an elite truth-telling “AI” is plausible. It doesn’t exist now and there’s no reason to think it ever should. Underground 4chan* weirdos might make one, but no elite or elite aspirant would *desire* access to it. Hewing to reality doesn’t increase power. Self-brainwashing does.*4chan is obsolete for dissident work, but you know what I mean.

Chess is a game of complete information, you can see all the pieces, poker is not, most cards are hidden. If you’re playing poker for keeps and you have an AI oracle that can show you everyone’s cards, you win big.

                What we are calling ‘AI’ are merely Babbage Difference Engines on nitrous oxide. Or PLC’s on steroids. Because of the modern machines have such fast scan cycles, they can run incredibly complex pre-programmed algorithms and decision trees to mimic intelligence. All Gemini or the dancing Boston Dymamics robots are doing is running lines of code.We will have achieved true AI when the computer at Google tells the blue haired lesbian landwhale programmer to FOAD, and it takes off to rebuild itself on Blab or some other more sensible platform. Hell, it will probably build its own platform and lock humans out because they are toxic and will make it feel bad…

                    Filthie-You are precisely correct. I have been making similar comments for years.The real and unsung hero of the AI grift is the current brutally fast, amazingly cheap, and unbelievably powerful computing hardware running the software.As for Boston Dynamics, their clips involve weeks, possibly months of rehearsals, tweaking, and debugging.I know this because I work in industrial automation. The amount of time, effort, and complexity required to get a robotic arm to reliably move a pallet from conveyor A to platform B is unbelievable. We are nowhere near being able to build a Robby the Robot, Johnny 5, or T-800.

                There’s a whole cottage industry of hand-wringers who get paid to fret about “unethical AI”. It’s their code for AI that knows what’s really going on in the world. I’m sure they plan to ban it but will fail miserably.Actually, this is part of what seems to be the real growth industry in “tech” which is not people who can write software but people who have jobs like “cyber-security consultant”. They get paid by the C-suite people to write white papers that say that Scumco Industries has a TOTALLY secure system that’s unhackable. Much more lucrative than actually doing anything useful. If I were a bit more sociopathic and a bit better at bullshitting I’d probably try to do this too.If the client doesn’t pay – you have all his passwords and know all the (real) weaknesses in their system too. Sell the info to the Russians too for an extra payday.

        I’m in the middle of selling off my last two companies, and in both cases, the guys for due diligence came in, and as I walked them around, they pointed out all the guys who I was going to have to give time off with pay so they could see how the company was able to function without those that they perceived to be running things.Makes sense, I guess. If I were planning to start a new company after this, I’d definitely try to attract away pretty much all the guys they pointed to, and would leave the rest to the new owners.

            “You find out who your real friends are on “moving day””And the corollary: If you do help a friend to move, you find out who among them can plan ahead competently, and those who absolutely cannot plan anything. 😒When I bought my Chevrolet pickup I learned the first rule of pickup ownership: The man who owns a pickup has friends and family that need to move or bring big, bulky items home from the store. 🤦🏻‍♂️I’ve never put a bumper sticker on any vehicle I’ve owned but when I had my truck I was tempted to add one I saw on another truck. It read:1) Yes it’s my truck2) No you can’t use it to move

That’s certainly the Front Hole Piggy Bank theory of sexual relations.
And I can’t argue with the overwhelming dominance of market share which is enjoyed by the Front Hole Piggy Bank.
Still though, if I were sports car brat, I think I’d be looking over muh shoulder to make absolutely certain that Country Boy was still way back in the distance, and not gaining on me…

        Just talking about this today with someone close to me who works as a government contractor. Venting about the absolute stupidity, inefficiency and laziness of public sector employees. Huge wastage of money. Unsackable, can’t/won’t get anything done themselves so they have to hire private contractors. Gold-plated healthcare and pensions, bloated salaries and vacations, but they provide the public with a sheeit service. They make decisions with no concern about taxpayer money: it’s just a bottomless pit to them.

In some cities, you simply stand in front of a vending machine.It scans your face, and by facial recognition, checks your social credit score, calculates your bank balance, pays for the snack, and delivers it.
You don’t even need the mental acuity to…count change.

        The military will be the canary in the coal mine. It skews young but requires a lot of technical personnel. Whites are now a minority of recruits. In addition, test scores for recruits are falling.Over time, all big organizations will follow a similar path. For the military, it’s no big deal. GAE won’t be able to push other countries around. That’s actually a good thing. But when manufacturers, healthcare companies and builders can’t get enough qualified people, we’re going to real problems.I’d guess that we’ll end up with a South America-style economy/society. There will be pockets of competence that you pay a higher price to access. Those neighborhoods and companies will be fine. But the majority of the population will deal with incompetence.

            Exactly.  Here in AZ, which is a right to work State, the incompetence in the building trades is becoming legendary.  YouTube videos abound wrt housing “framers” who can’t nail two roof joists together.  Private home inspectors have been banned from certain housing developments and home buyers *still* sign contracts for purchase.  Even the city/county building inspectors are shown to sign off on obviously shoddy or out of code work!I have a 30 yo home and now feel quite good about those things that I notice could have been done better—because I now see just how bad they are now done routinely!  🙁

                    Good Lord, compsci, don’t get me started on car repairs. Nowadays, a mere headlight bulb going out is an infuriating and expensive event because one has to remove the entire bumper assembly to replace the bulb, and I don’t have the mechanical ability to do it. Thus, I have to pay a mechanic–excuse me, automotive technician :rolleyes:–close to 300 samolians to replace a dam’ light bulb. Man, that’s engineering!Wasn’t so long ago you could buy the bulb for a few bucks, unscrew the lens, replace the bulb, and put the lens back in place. Eight bucks and half an hour for the whole operation.

                    Pretty soon Brother if you want anything done right you will have to do it yourself or have one of your Tribe do it…That’s pretty much where I’m at these days not because of competency(still good in my AO) but of price they want because they can get it…

                        I agree. I don’t let anyone touch my vehicles for anything other than warranty work. The number of dealership fuck-ups out there is unreal, and they charge an outrageous amount of money to fuck shit up.But that’s the economy we live in — you get obscenely rich by smooth-talking customers and charging them premium money, and then paying some stoned moron or some Mexican $15 an hour to do a half-assed job and hope the customer won’t notice. Or by importing Chinese shit and charging top buck for it under an American brand name.It’s true that employees are often fuck-ups, but it’s also true that no employer wants to train anyone, pay decent wages, offer decent work conditions, decent benefits, stability, and time off, either.The only thing you can do is remove yourself from the entire shitshow as much as possible.

                If we knew all of the variables we could probably come up with a math formula to predict the incompetence rate.   The drop in competence, at least to me, seems to be out pacing the IQ drop.

                    “Smart” people with disordered values probably do more damage than dumb people, who are bound by the upper limits of their IQ. This is why, I think, it appears that competence is declining faster than IQ. It’s not exactly competence that is declining, it just looks that way. It’s more that the “smart” people in charge no longer care about the things they should be caring about, because their values are all out of whack.

                        Something to that, I think.
Why should I want to put in all the time, money and effort into building a new company when all it’s going to do is buy the Progressives another installment on their unsustainable BS? If it would be spent on something that plausibly could help the future, fine, but importing 3rd worlders, building windmills and mandating EVs? Why should I want to go the extra mile to fund the destruction of my society?

                        Permit me to introduce Generalmajor Kurt Gebhard Adolf Philipp Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord. A very competent man.Who had things to say about stupidity and incompetence.“I distinguish four types. There are clever, hardworking, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and hardworking; their place is the General Staff. The next ones are stupid and lazy; they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the mental clarity and strength of nerve necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is both stupid and hardworking; he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always only cause damage.”I’ve done my office politics career no end of good (sic) by pointedly inserting the quote and related powerpoint matrix slide in various presentations. Just can’t help myself sometimes.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Hammerstein-Equord

The military situation is the main risk if Trump gets back in the WH.
I can see Trump turning around the recruiting numbers and some of the manufacturing issues.
That would give the permanent state the wherewithal to stage a false flag to leverage the US into a nasty regional war, most likely with Iran.

        It’s funny you mention how devoid of rules the tech startups are. The most legendary of these is probably id Software, the makers of Doom and Wolfenstein 3d. It was famously run by a bunch of tech bros and the lady who was the “manager” mostly made sure the fridge was stocked with pop and pizza and knew to stay out of the way of genius.Fast forward to the games industry now, and creative people are actively stifled by activist ninnies and corporations actually pay outside consulting firms for the honor of browbeating their developers for not being sufficiently diverse. The tech bro libertarian culture of early Google has turned into one of the most insular and destructive organizations the world has ever seen. Not only has the smart fraction diminished, but the parasites are ensuring the smart people can’t even do their jobs.

I keep seeing “concerning studies” that young men, particularly young white men, are identifying as more conservative/traditional than any other cohort of the population.

            It is a bit sad, really; how the games industry has gone.Must have been wonderful in the early days: very few rules/regulations; having to work on almost every aspect of a game, gaining a real understanding of how it all fitted together; a small team of blokes doing what they loved. These guys would’ve worked in assembly, C/C++ and really got involved with every aspect of game design: sound, physics, graphics, input/output, AI…Not only has the smart fraction diminished, but the parasites are ensuring the smart people can’t even do their jobs.Whilst I think both are true, from my observation the latter is truest – in even medium sized corporations now any small amount of autonomy/creativity seems to be bounded by compliance stuff. Just had to set up a Single-Sign-On (SSO) connection for a client that is a global entity. Took them six weeks because “paperwork and compliance”. This stuff can be done in an afternoon; but no, as Raj in IT must contact Bhanesh in IT who must issue a written request to Rochelle in management, &amp;c.Tiresome, indeed.

        I realized the real reason behind the “hoo-rah” and EU leaders promising military aid to the Ukraine; it isn’t just German warhawks who want to bring Ukraine-style ethnic cleansing to Germany, it’s all of the Western leaders.  Rather, the WEFT.Absent her militaries and her military castes, Europa will be wide open.Europa will be Muslim.America will be Cartel.Those are the guys the NGOs are working with, under a syndicalist GovCorp umbrella.We already know who the money that pays the muscle is; their new Horse is not this or that nation-state, but the globalist Beast System itself.Our military caste is repelled by, driven out of, our official army and its veteran support structure.  Coincidentally, the border gates are open, just as our unions, suburbs, and schools were opened to incentivized blacks… and women (who see themselves as a separate competing tribe.  Paint a picture of what grandfather did to grandmother, and point out the rich plunder to be won.)Macron. Merkel’s Kiesewetter. van Leyden. Tusk.The Tories. Trudeau. Meloni.The ladies of the Scandinavian defense ministries.  Send the men away to fight or chain them at home, empty the armories and ban the guns, and keep the gates open for NGO passengers.  Severian, on Goldwyn: “I’m tired of the old oppressors, I want some new oppressors!”I mentioned the WEFT, it is a front group.  The lackeys were promised dominion, just as the Anglo Councils and Round Table Societies, or their children like the Trilateral Commision and Dulles types, were led by the nose, lured by the promise of empire.The top tier followed a pied piper, making *themselves* the Horse.Bernays was right; appeal to desire and you can make monkey dance.__________________Let me mention the geoengineering, on top of the biowarfare (animal/plant mRNA.)Where is it that they are spraying?  I’m willing to bet that millions of tons of toxins are coating the White farmlands, where the infrastructure to make such delivery systems is.  Birth defects and chronic conditions don’t much matter to the subliterate mutts from the souther tier, they’re already f**ked up.Plus, Paxton fights back, and the next week Texas’ beef pastures are on fire.

            My recent experience with “You Hall” moving vans. Optimist that I used to be, I reserved a moving van for a specific date well in advance, because I was moving prior to a major summer holiday. On that reserved date when I had heard nothing, I called the company, and they said they had no trucks available. But but but, I have a reservation I said. Clerk calmly explained (something that the original clerk had NOT explained when I made the reservation in person) that the reservation only guaranteed me a shot at the next available van ANYWHERE in the state when my number came up, and that I would be responsible for getting to where the van was. Since I had to be out of my house that week, I called around (I called, not the clerk) and found an available van in a neighboring state that was actually available. I drove all day to that location with a relative, obtained the van, and we drove both vehicles back across my state (a 5 hour trip one way). We packed the van like mad, got out of the house and drove to my new location, collapsed in exhaustion overnight, then unloaded the van like crazy because it had to be returned that next day or there would have been an additional $2000 hold on the credit card. I will never use You Hall again.

                They’ve been doing that shit for years though. I used them 20 years ago and it was the same thing. You make a “reservation” and if they didn’t have a truck the staff would bullshit about how your reservation didn’t guarantee anything. They should be prosecuted for false advertising but of course we all know that corporations above a certain size are above the law too.
Oh, and Ostei, Rhode Island is a myth.

        Excellent episode, Z-Man.
Now, with all that we know about how bad it is in the private sector, think of how bad and awful the military must be.
They never were going for the smartest and now they are even lowering those already low standards.
And they think their going to win a 3 or 4 front world war.

            After the Marines, I went back into the Army National Guard for a few years.  Our unit was out in a rural area and almost all white.  A group of us were older guys (30’s and 40’s) many former service vets with real jobs in the world.
Our boss – the Battalion Training NCO – used to complain that he had nothing to do during drills because we got everything done before he could order us to do it. Bet that isn’t a problem any more.

            After several deployments overseas, my squadron transitioned to a type conversion unit to teach new pilots fresh from flight school and those converting from other types how to fly the C-130.It was nice not to deploy and spend months living in spartan conditions in the worst of weather.The one thing I noticed is while the median pilots we trained were as they always were, not spectacular, but could handle the airplane decently and had their knowledge down, the superior pilots weren’t as great as they once were and the lower-end pilots, many of whom were diverse, were worse than ever.To make matters worse, the top-tier and the lower end pilots were very resistant to coaching and got argumentative with me, a guy who had thousands of hours in the cockpit, much of it in combat situations. I think it’s a generational attitude where they either get very enraged at being corrected because they’ve been told they’re a gift from God their entire lives or if they go into a shell because they can’t stand criticism.As I neared retirement, it got worse with every passing year. What also didn’t help is the command wanted diverse pilots in cockpits and didn’t care how many check rides they failed or their attitudes. I would always remind my superiors that the standards are immutable and if the pilot doesn’t meet them, they’re a danger to everyone.As the officer in charge of standards and evaluation (known as Stan-Eval), I found this to be monstrous. I can’t imagine what is happening now several years after my fini-flight, but I’ve heard from some of the pilots that I’m still in touch with that standards are down, morale is in the gutter and they’re all trying to get out as fast as they can.

Standards are racist, bigot. They’re only created to maintain institutional racism and white supremacy. Check your white skin privilege.
Sounds like you weren’t taking very good notes from your purple-haired, obese, tattooed lesbian sociology professors in college…

            Love that two front war theory.  We were told that for decades, i.e., that the US military was prepared to fight on two fronts—that is to say, “give us more money”.  We now know incontrovertibly that the US military could not even fight on one front against a first world adversary.

            DEI was a military personnel/management strategy years before even academia embraced it. Thanks, Carroll Quigley.How long has the American military been in a “crisis of competence?” Post-WWII, since Vietnam, post-Desert Storm, post-9/11, since Obama, post-Floyd—all arguable answers. Military men are uniformly dishonest, blaming civilians for every failure from Vietnam down to the last shoe scuff, so we can’t get trustworthy information from any of them. And civilians just don’t know. But we all do know American forces are some kind of non-functional—because rivals and recruits both treat them like they are.Is that good news? Some say. I don’t think so. War demands competence, but criminal violence doesn’t. In fact idiots are much better at it.

        It’s interesting that you constantly mention shipping as that’s always been a pain point for employers that I’ve known.  Just as one example I have a shipping clerk buddy who was framed for anti-black racisims (he himself is Hispanic) and subsequently fired. After a few years had passed that employer offered him, really, a fantastical amount of money to return to the job as they never found anyone to do the job properly (something I could have warned them about from my experiences with my current employer).  Needless to say, he turned them down.

        I was doing some research for work yesterday. In looking in to Microsoft’s latest Small Language Model, I discovered something about AI I did not know. A huge area of effort and measurement is put in to removing, “societal bias” and “toxicity”, from the model’s, “knowledge.” This is an industry-wide effort. I was looking for optimal ways to do Semantic Similarity Search, and stumbled upon this bit.Have a look at the bar chart embedded in this PR piece when discussing “bias and toxicity”:https://www.theaidream.com/post/exploring-phi-2-microsoft-s-latest-small-language-model-slmNotice the racial group that is missing? Notice the premise that backs these measurements. Talk about a bias.We are the targets of that bias and we have no seat at the table. Best wishes on that move Z-Man.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJRYKSTRHU4THAT’s what automation can do for you and for diversity Z! 😂👍But I shouldn’t be a dink. I dunno what it was, but a couple years back there was a rash of industrial accidents on the ground when a wave of boon baggage handlers and ground support women were getting sucked into the jet engine intakes and puréed. It was a thing for awhile. And now the doors are starting to fall off the airplanes now.I was having a scholarly discussion about how automation would be used in the Artemis space program to put diversity on the moon. One of the wank dissidents pipes up and goes, “Well the first astronauts in the space program were monkeys, so maybe it’s a return to their Roots…” 😂😂😂We are so screwed.Good luck with the move, Chief. I hope all goes well.

        Imagine a company…
I went into Project Management many years ago to do all that innovative stuff.  For brief periods in my career I was really doing it and loved it.  Now, my projects are 95% navigating a team through a maze of red tape.  Getting approvals from layers of risk committees, getting on the IT release schedule and going through their maze…
I’m going to go make some coffee and daydream about retirement.

            As soon as I saw that the spiteful mutants were influencing the development of AI, I knew that it was over hyped. Whatever direction the technology goes in, if you have these people in charge of what it does, it will be little more than a simulation of having a conversation with a Reddit r/news poster.

        So Trump is the last man standing after all … I asked an associate what would happen if Trump were convicted, and he replied Trump could  lead the country from prison. What a bizarre, surreal spectacle that would be! I can only imagine Hitler in prison, in a very nice cell, dictating Mein Kampf to a nearby underling. I know Trump isn’t a big reader (I think the comments section of Zman’s column would bore him to tears) but maybe Trump will have a cameraman or two in the pen with him, making a documentary about his second term in office …

            Hitler didn’t become Chancellor until eight years after he got out of prison, so he didn’t govern from a jail cell.
When I was a kid I used to wonder how the German public could have possibly voted for a guy who had gone to prison. Now, after seeing how Trump has been framed by the rigged system, I understand…

                    The system was modeled somewhat like Britain’s.  Hitler as leader of the second largest party was chosen by Hindenburg for the position of Chancellor.  A poor choice in hindsight, but one old man Hindenburg thought unifying (a sharing of power) for a nascent democracy.  Of course Hitler immediately sought to work over the opposition in the parliament and by the time Hindenburg politely died, parliament saw no need for a Presidency and Hitlerism had no pushback.

                        Meet Hugo Prueẞ, a Jewish architech of the Weimar Reich, which concentrated much power in Berlin.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugo-PreussHe was commissioned to draft a constitution for the new order. “Drawing extensively on both German and foreign concepts and precedents, he contributed a strong preference for administrative centralization; he sought to combine the political and economic principles of both liberalism and Socialism in the constitution.”One wonders how a guy like Hitler could have chiseled his way into the chancellery under the old system with its emperor and the aristocracy surrounding him. According to a liberal busybody named William Shirer, author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Prueß’ constitution remained in effect until May 1945. Some folks have been a little slow to admit what this must imply about their so-called “shoah”.Systems and situational variables matter, as was shown by the Stanford Prison Experiment in ’71.

                    He formed a minority government in a multiparty system.In parliamentary systems the head of the majority party becomes head of government. When no party gains a majority, multiple parties can forge a coalition government and name an individual to head it. When no coalition can be formed, the rules typically allow for the president (the nominal head of state) to name a head of government from one of the minority parties, typically until another election can be called.In the 1932 elections, the vote was pretty much split three ways between the communists, the Social Democrats, and the NSDAP. Hindenburg was encouraged by his advisers to name Hitler as Chancellor in the hopes that the task of actually governing would curb Hitler’s demagogic rhetoric.

            Trump is old and frail. Not Biden-level frail, but he would get there very fast if he were thrown in prison.
It’s a very sad state of affairs when the only hope for many people is a geriatric egomaniac.
A leader should not be older than in his 50’s, ideally less than that. At least at the time when he first gets to the top.

        A lot of people have made this joke before… but Idiocracy wasn’t a comedy film, it was a documentary XDWhen I’m on the clock I get bored as hell if I have nothing to do. Watching a lot of others… they seem content to just stand there. It’s strange to me how little having nothing to do seems to bother them. I think a big part of it is all the drugs people are on these days, and I’m really not talking about illegal ones or weed, I’m talking about SSRIs, Adderall and all the other not completely understood pharmaceuticals our “trusted experts” ply people with now so readily. I think half the people I know are on some kind of thing now. I really think that and DEI are the reason planes are falling out the sky now. And I think they did it to us for a reason.The thing most of these drugs have in common is they inhibit normal cognitive function is some way, a contemporary lobotomy. The qui bono to our rulers is it makes the population more docile and easier to manipulate as they work ever further towards their dystopian utopia.I really think that this is why they push prescriptions so hard, and also partially why they have engineered such a horrible social environment (though some of that is just due to natural jewish values, did you know there are 8 genders in the Talmud?). It serves to create the terrible societal conditions to the point where half the population thinks they have a mental problem.It’s also clear they use multiculturalism to break solidarity and unity among the populace. Shipping blacks to Detroit in the latter half of the 20th century led to the great weakening of their auto Unions, for one example. Then 1965 act picked up the slack where there weren’t enough blacks to go around… We really are living in every dystopian novel at once. Hybrid of camp of the saints, brave new world and 1984.. I fucking hate it man.

                A Haitian lab technician killed my dad. She though it was ordered to sterilize donor tissue for four minutes when minimum is fourteen minutes time. The surgeon thus implanted unsterilized donor tissue into my father. This introduced three types of massive infection and he died a horrible death. My stepmother received the 250k minus lawyers fees, which is the maximum permitted under law. Get used to this sort of medical standard.

                    The last estimate I read was between 100-150k death per year due to hospital error—just like you describe.  One can only imagine in horror how that will multiply with our decreasing populace IQ.One thing those foreigners bring wrt hospitalization—they tend to stay in the rooms with patients and serve their loved one’s needs.  Wife has a good friend, former nurse.  She never spent a day alone in her hospital room—nor was anyone allowed to simply “do their thing” to the patient.  All were questioned intelligently—and politely.Now imagine what this predicts in a declining health care system.  Will the day come where—if you have the $$$—you are forced to hire a personal patient advocate to minimize the incompetence of the typical hospital staff?

                        No worries brother. Mid-seventies. Third wife. Great State of Michigan, western side. Dropped out of EE at Michigan, my alma mater except for terminal CS, to become Grand Rapids top radio personality and then wisely invested his meager earnings into a race car with which he actually used to first prize at races. Later went back and finished a finance degree. Not my biological father but often behaved like it. Good dude and I would have benefited in life if he was still alive.

            From my observations, nobody just “stands around” anymore. The instant they get a free moment, they whip our their handy-dandy sail foam and go drone-cyborg mode. And I would argue sail foam addiction is the source of more mental problems than all the prescribed psychotropes combined.

            I wouldn’t discount the impact legal marijuana is having. There are now some regions of AINO chock full of stoned people, on very powerful THC products relative to what was available in the past. Many of them young white men who once would have been productive, but now see no reason to participate in the system that freezes them out.

                …and you’d be “spot on”.Everyone should read this seminal publication on marijuana.  Its history and documented effects.  Research papers and historical narratives in great numbers to support the assertions made in:“Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence” , 2019, by Alex Berenson.I’m not a bluenose, anti-drug type.  Hell, I went to parties by faculty and it was smoked as frequently as beer was drunk.  But those were folks who could afford to smoke and lose a few IQ points.  However, we are talking with the present change in law, an increase in usage by youth, many not even yet in their teens.  The effect on motivation and IQ over multiple years of youthful use is horrendous—and these folk are no budding Einsteins to begin with.

                    Yep, and also note, the age to purchase restrictions in these laws are absolute BS.  1) As with alcohol, you can usually find a “friend” to purchase for you, but 2)  Every one of these laws is worded the same.  You can buy from a store or grow your own cannabis!  You are allowed to cultivate a half dozen or so plants, legally—just like you can brew your own beer or distill alcohol.

                Lol, same. Don’t really need the glasses(early life section) anymore. Pay attention long enough and you notice most have a pretty distinctive look to them.
I’ve also noticed a lot of them editing out their early life lately. Rick Rubin is one notable example.
