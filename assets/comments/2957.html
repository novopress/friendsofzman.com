        You seem to be taking Ralph Peter’s position on Europe —  that the Euros will go Fascist before they go Arab or African.Normally, I try to stake out the corner cases and then postulate the “playing field” in between.  However, I don’t think I can frame this problem that way.  I believe that the Euros at this juncture face a very polar solution set.  They can try to blockade the barbarian hordes… they might even outsource the really ugly bits as you suggest.  Or they commit suicide.   I think Spengler the Younger would take the second option.  I always thought a debate between him and Peters would be pretty kick ass.The Spanish have been fighting off the migrant waves fairly well at Ceuta and Melilla.  So there’s some hope there.  Alternatively, the Euros seem to be acting like they are already conquered in places like Rotherham and Malmo.I’m kind of in an interesting situation right now and hanging out with a lot of Euros.  I don’t think they have the will to resist effectively.  If there are any Sobieskis or Martels out there, I’m not meeting them.  And so far, La Virgen is silent… no entreaties to pray for the conversion of the Musselmen.

        I would love to know where you get the figure of 1 in 6 to be murdered, and also where will the drug-addled youths will get their drugs? The common sense here is that as the state withdraws its money to pay the underclass to lounge around and do nothing except drink and take drugs then there will be trouble. That’s a given: I think as the anti-riot payments stop the word anti becomes redundant, but there won’t be many drugs being made or sold among it.Most cannabis farms in the UK use vast amounts of electricity to make the weed grow, and heat-detection is the usual way the cops find them. But once the power supply fails, weed growing is not going to be very lucrative.But, the future will unfold in some interesting ways I have no doubt.

            I was merely painting a picture of a bleak future where food shortages implode the civil structures. But when you’re murder rate is 40/100,000 in the best of times, it’s not hard to imagine it rising to ten times that rate in a famine.

        I suspect that African women of every race are capable of changing their breeding habits, which actually appears to be what the Yemenis did in response to free food.
Even some of the most unintelligent people on earth have practiced reproductive control for eons. What is more difficult is convincing the Eloi to stop feeding the bears. Only a few hundred hangings would leave that peculiar class in a more productive relationship with gravity, and possibly save billions from short lives of misery. But this will play out the other way.
