        And why are so many of these judges foreigners? This alone should be a deal-breaker. If someone wasn’t legally born in the United States to American parents, they shouldn’t be sitting on any bench, period.

            Imagine a hypothetical Judge Williams on the 2nd Circuit in Hangzhou, China,  ruling that lawless Nigerian gangs must stay in Hangzhou. Justice Williams would be removed or killed and Chinese would be racist against white people forever.
JK, the Chinese would never allow a white man to be a judge, even if he was a Chinese citizen and spoke perfect Mandarin.

                    There was no shortage of (((Fellow Chinese))) and other Foreign Friends during the revolutionary period and the first half century of the PRC. All died off now.The Chinese were never so stupid as to give them actual power as commissars or ministers though — tended to keep them around as doctors, technical specialists, academics, translators, foreign language propagandists, etc. Many of them had a rough time during the Cultural Revolution, but not as rough as the Chinese themselves.Hereis the autobiography of one of them. Makes for interesting reading. You see occasional flashes of self-awareness as he looks back on his rather varied career.The Chinese of Current Year are in the enviable position of not needing any foreign help or trouble makers and have no qualms about saying so.

                This could not happen in China.  Why?  Because China is not a “democracy”, but rather rule of an elite body, or rather the CCP.  A country of 1.4B ruled perhaps by a clique of a few dozen people.  Example, the ruling political body, the PSG, constitutes *7* people.

                        China is ruled by Han for the Han.
They have their problems, but they don’t have a misalignment problem. There is no truly viable way for members of their elite to defect or sell out.

            That has been the biggest surprise in all this, as bad as I thought things were, I didn’t know we so many judges who are in no meaningful way Americans.The biggest reason I think Roberts will try to defend the judges as best he can is that they are members in good standing of the blob and he has devoted his life to defending the blob.  The one judge’s wife was praised by the Biden Admin for opening an abortion mill in Virginia and is on various boards in the area. Every time a blob member does something like this, look up the spouse and consider the possibility he cares far more about avoiding uncomfortable conversations at home or with friends than anything else.

                    Nobody has anything on anybody. Roberts acts how he acts because that’s how he is.
The ruling class isn’t bullied into hating and mistreating you. Itishating and mistreating you. That’s the vocation.
And they knew that this was how it would go, that it would end in Trump (the people) vs. the judges. In preparation, “kritarchy” was made awhite nationalist antisemitic trope—in 2019. Timely!Remember?

                        This.  I  do not understand why so many assume someone ‘has something’ on someone else to account for their anti-White or anti-right stance.  It’s yet another cope.  How about accepting these people hate you?  They don’t give a f**k about your supposed ‘rights.’  They value the system that has enriched and empowered them – they always have.  That’s why they will do anything to ensure they and their children remain part of it.

                            Projection. If you wouldn’t cave on a matter of principle, why would you assume someone else would?
As a hardened cynic, I have the opposite problem. Until proven otherwise, I assume everyone is pulling a“It depends on what the definition of “is” is.”

                                Because I don’t assume other people are just like me – I know for a fact that they are not.  And what most people call ‘principles’ are convenient delusions they will jettison at the first challenge or difficulty.  If one of my boys had come to be and said he was a trannie or luvved a non-White, my principles would have come first.  Not so for most people – I’ve seen it repeatedly.

                                    This is indeed true.  From experience, I’ve come to the same conclusion.  Even as it refers to me.  I ought to avoid such people as you describe, but more often than not would bite my lower lip to keep dissension within the family down and tolerate their presence at gatherings.
The right thing to do of course is to shun them.  Toleration in these matters is not a virtue.

                                        This. Thanks for taking leadership on this topic.The number 1 reason American men abdicated their position in the family, and indeed their masculinity, is this desire for smoothness, for compatibility, for lack of confrontation . . . to keep a quiet house, in short.Do you not imagine that women and their State know this?U.S. men gained material wealth and hard-charging careers (but no children) for their daughters, but they lost their God and their nation. Their wives and children therefore rule over them, even as:‘Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. My people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.’  (Isaiah 3:12)There is a price to men for being faithful to God. And there is a price to men for tolerating evil in preference of personal tranquility and/or material gain.

                            Upper class whites have embraced a religion of hating lower class whites.
Higher education communicates that a precondition to joining the upper class is accepting the religion.
The civil rights revolution as promoted by the media anathematized traditional white americans as racists. I remember being convinced of this in many classes starting in junior high school in Seattle.
Did anyone else watch Roots in class? I remember a scene in “Great Santini” of racist good old boys bullying an angelic black man, which they also made us watch.

                                I was in college when Roots premiered, and I did not watch tv.  I was still largely a shitlib, but I had already taken the first steps towards race realism.  I recall a beloved neighbor – who had been a mother figure to me – gushing about the show when I was home on break, and even then it rubbed me the wrong way.  Prescient of where she and her family went culturally and politically.

                                The “Great Santini” was even worse than simply idolizing an “angelic” Black man.  It taught a subtle lesson to naive Whites—that redemption (from the “original” sin of slavery) could only be achieved through active “anti” racism in one’s actions and words.  In short, you had to be “woke”.
This lesson was being taught at least a 30 years ago before it went mainstream in the literature under the rubric of “critical whiteness studies” ala Ibram X. Kendi (How to Be an Antiracist) and Robin DiAngelo (White Fragility),

SCOTUS is the Wizard in the Wizard of Oz. Man behind the curtain with no real power.
When confronted, it tucks its tail and runs to lick its wounds and rebuild the illusion.
But it does have to be confronted.

            Yes. Recently there was a state government official arraigned for taking bribes from China. The official was Chinese. The arraignment took place in Brooklyn and the judge was a Chinawoman who threw the case out.
People do not realize how far gone this thing is in certain jurisdictions. The task of the moment is finding and building your own jurisdiction.

                When you get down to it, the J6 trials and prosecutions were little more than nons punishing whites for racial reasons, and the same applied to the failure to go after the Floyd rioters. If people did not understand the racial implications of the courts then, will they now? The Chinese thing, btw, is of a piece with Hans in the US military caught spying recently for their actual countrymen. That story has been memoryholed, of course.

            Who decides is all that matters. What is happening with the courts is no surprise. Unless the executive and legislative branches can muster the will to gut the courts, and they have shown no ability to do so, who/whom will reach the breaking point in short order.

                “Kritarchy” is probably the worst form of government ever devised, and we have been living under one at least since Brown, which is nearly seventy years. Of course, the kritarchs have aligned with the managers to enforce their edicts against both the Executive and Legislative branches, which is how they get around Jacksonian contempt.Going after the bureaucracy is fine, but the real enemy is the kritarchy. My hope is that Trump will launch a full scale assault on the judiciary, including disavowing Marbury, the root of all this poisoned fruit (Jefferson was right about that). My fear is that he will quietly comply while impotently thumping his chest, and reform will die an ignominious death in the reconciliation bill.

                    In the Old Testament God thought the Hebrews were idiots for wanting to move away from the rule of judges and have a king. He warned them against it, but then when they continued to be stupid he said, basically, “Fine. Have it your way. You can get what you asked for, good and hard.”Kritarchy isn’t a “bad” form of government any more than any other. The problem comes down to who the judges are and from whom they derive their authority.The judges in our system are generally globalists and they derive their authority from theruler of this world.

                            True, but the reason they were “judges” and not “kings” was, I think, they they were not sovereign over the people — the people were not subjects of the judge they way they were subjects of the king. God was supposed to be their sovereign and they shouldn’t need an earthly king. Thus a lot of the OT judges’ functions were, actually, judging — mediating disputes between the people and enforcing God’s word among them.

            A gripping read from Zman today. Clearly, Trump is going to have to “drain the swamp.” The question is how? I think the answer is lying right before Trump’s eyes. It comes in the form of a surprise gift — Elon Musk’s DOGE. Trump can pretend to be saving taxpayer money 💰 while in reality he is taking the sharp blade of a shovel to the gnarled roots of the Cypress trees (Deep State) in the swamp. In a glorious turnaround, the Mainstays of the managerial class will be vanquished. The only danger? That the civil society of the United States succumbs to Caesarism in the form of a new imperial presidency of the 21st Century…— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            Trump needs to say that  these are not judges but political actors and thus they, and their family,  friends, and associates will now be receiving intense unending scrutiny.  You know there are a lot of people close to these leftist judges that were feeding at the illegitimate NGO troughs. Arrest anyone associated with at least  the slightest bit of impropriety. Let their sweet little blue haired princess daughters rot in jail for years without trial. The precedent was set with the J6rs.

        I don’t know what the answer is, but these damned judges HAVE to be dealt with.  No reform at all will be accomplished if they are allowed to continue to jam it up.  Further, the legal system in this country is a joke.  The number of lawyers, judges and laws need a serious culling.

            As Zman notes, these judges really are playing with fire. It’s only a matter of time before some red hat whose relative got run over by a drunk illegal, or some blue hat who thinks the judges aren’t doing enough to thwart the orange man, decide to make a  Mario Bros statement on one of the judges similar to that CEO in NYC.

            Musk has posted frequently that the rogue judges need to be impeached, but generations of pussification has made Congress too weak to do even it’s most basic functions.  As Z points out though, they’ll need to “man up” if they have any desire of saving the system.

                    You can impeach, just can’t convict.  But what you can do is turn the process into punishment.  And against the right targets shred their credibility publicly.

                It’s bizarre that one of our three branches of government have totally abdicated their duty and responsibility and everyone just accepts it. They handed their legislative functions to the executive and their oversight functions to the judiciary and wiped their hands of it. Of course, our system cannot function in this way, and sure enough, it doesn’t. Heck, the Supreme Court has even tried to wrest control of some of this stuff away from the executive/judicial branch and back to the legislative, most notably with Chevron, but even then they’re not interested.

            “We are now seeing another phase of this as district judges claim authority over vast parts of the executive branch.”When a District Court judge issues a ruling striking down an blue state gun control law, the ruling is strictly limited to his district, immediately stayed, and then overturned on appeal.When a District Court judge issues an injunction claiming national power over the Executive Branch (if the president’s name happens to be “Trump”)… it’s OK.The courts in this country are completely full of shit. There is no objective principle governing them. They exist to create contradictory sophisms to justify whatever it is the ruling class wants.

        It is interesting to see the way these institutions just trundle on like nothing happened. For example, to name two, the media and the public health authorities torched all the trust people had in them. But I will read articles from WaPo and the New York Times where the NIH/CDC/etc. and doctors whine that people don’t listen to them anymore. The fact that people dont listen to them because they proved themselves to be not just untrustworthy but malicious does not factor into it. It’s just a weird dynamic.Likewise, we are told by these scoundrels that guys like Judge Boasberg is a thoughtful, neutral, independent magistrate who only cares about the facts. This is years after he was shown to be a totally partisan and malicious actor who helped push the Russia hoax and cover the tracks of the scumbags who engineered it. Well, we have information now. They can’t engineer consent. It’s over.

        Long past time judges were ignored.  Back in the 90s, CA was still fighting to remain great and the people overwhelmingly voted for a proposition to NOT allow illegals welfare or education.
With one stroke of a pen, a judge overruled millions of people and killed the state.  It’s time to realize we are in a WAR; the other side must be ignored and destroyed.  If Trump is unable to summon the power to ignore these unelected judges, then it’s just all for show.

        In other words, this dip into lawlessness we are seeing could very well portend a general descent into lawlessness. Like post-Soviet Russia, we could very well be entering a period where we get poorer as the rule of law collapses. Unlike Russia, America is not a homogenous society with a thousand years of history. America is a diverse country which is a polite way of saying it is a collection of people who would just as soon not share a country with one another.There is much to unpack there, and it is true in part and wrong in part.The United States is utterly lawlessnow and has been for a long time. The Constitution and Rule of Law were eviscerated years ago, and you have to go almost to the founding to be in a time when that was not the case. The district court judges are behaving in a vulgar and blatant manner but it is only an undisguised version of their actions over the last few decades. The appellate courts are fine with it, too, and often join in the criminality.The United States is poorernow. There is an abundance of consumer goods, but the previous indicators of a settled, stable life such as housing are out of reach of younger people. Yes, the country could get poorer, but the process started at least as far back as the Seventies oil shock.All heterogeneous societies eventually descend into violence and bloodshed. Arguably that is the intent on the part of many of throwing open the borders. The Soviet Union indeed was fortunate in that regard.The United States is fragmentingnow. It isn’t formalized, and likely will not be for several decades out, but otherwise oppositional people are sharing a country now only due to (a) the aforementioned abundance, which is going away, and (b) the force of arms.People in Third World countries recognize the judicial insurrection now underway; Bukele in Salvador explicitly called it such. Unlike those countries, though, the United States is a vast empire with enormous wealth even though it is concentrated in few hands. The elite, who will suffer the most, would be we wise to localize economic collapses in such places as the D.C. metro area, Silicon Valley and NYC and to build up the rest of the country. That may in fact be happening. The internal migration underway can be accelerated further this way, and setting up a new Constantinople outside the Banana Empire’s corrupt capitol city might be the way to go. In that sense, at least, there are remarkable similarities between the GAE and the Roman Empire.Yes, the ideal is to preserve a somewhat viable legal system–Chesterton’s Fence and all–but that probably cannot be done now.

                    Although Madison and the founders were careful architects, the conflict exposed by Marbury seems to be something that they overlooked (like citizenship for whites only).  Can the court declare legislation unconstitutional?
Chief Justice Marshall’s ruling established the Court as the most powerful branch of government.  The only problem is that, as Old Hickory said to Marshall, the Court has no army.
Steve, would you have decided Marbury differently?
HEY Z MAN, perhaps the topic is too wonky for you and RAMZ, but you should do a show on Marbury versus Madison!

                        Personally, I I were the lazy SOB who hadn’t done my job delivering the commissions, I’d recuse myself. It was Marshall himself who screwed the pooch, then took it out on Madison.
They should have brought back tarring and feathering with that decision. A little reminder for the judiciary to stay in its lane.
If I did not have Marshall’s conflict of interest, I’d like to think my decision would have paralleled the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves — that each individual state had the power to declare a given federal act unconstitutional and unenforceable in their state.

            “The United States is fragmentingnow. It isn’t formalized, and likely will not be for several decades out . . .  .”The USA will fragment “officially,” if you want to use that word, by 2032 b/c so many people still believe that there are political solutions to … well, everything. I expect the Dems to retake the House next year and probably the White House in ’28. They will go for revenge–literallyrevanchisme. Those who still believe in voting willstillbelieve in voting, so they will hang on until 2032, and then there will be a breakup; a national divorce–and not for the first time.So I can’t agree that the final breakup is decades away. I think it’s two election cycles away. A great many people already understand that we cant vote our way out of this, but we haven’t yet reached “critical mass.” Too many people still have too much faith in the System; in voting.call them “normies” or whatever you like, but their minds are still captive to the notion that there are political solutions and that those solutions are available through voting. So they’ll hang on till the bitter end–two cycles away–2032.

                As far as the welfare of our people, from your lips to God’s ears, but I suspect it will take much greater economic pain–which is coming eventually–to formalize the divorce. I also think, from a political standpoint, if the Left thinks it will be shut out of absolute power for much longer it might very well take the lead in the separation. That probably would be the most peaceful way about it if we are so lucky. I’m sticking with “decades,” though. We have thede factoversion even now and that is somewhat of a release valve while houses are warm and bellies full.

            The US has already TRIED to fragment via “Sanctuary Cities,” which the right has pretty much ignored until recently.
The problem with this “soft” assertion of States’ Rights is it’s only allowed one direction.
The Feds have been openly dumping human refuse into non compliant states for over a decade now in order to take them over via the ballot box.

                That started to change with Covid, which is why I think it was brought to an end. The reputed other side actually refused to follow federal Covid mandates and edicts and that scared the hell out of the Regime. More than just tried, fragmentation is well underway.

            For this to work they will have to drop the Boomer Truth Regime in its entirety. This will require open defiance and then dismantling of its pillar that we call Civil Rights and that legal regime. For what good is moving the capital and setting up a new civilization if you bring all of the problems and albatross populations with you?I don’t think the current regime even believes in doing that much less wants to do it. Maybe more light bulbs went off during Connor MacGregor’s visit on St. Patrick’s Day. There have to be open and frank discussions of TGR and its implications, not on civic nationalism, but on the very existence of our people and our homelands.This is a great post. It is better if the project you talk about continues as a grassroots, self-organized movement for a long time than to be officially sanctioned. Until officialdom adopts the views that everyone here holds, they should stay out of it so they don’t ruin it all over again – 1619 and Ellis Island all over again and such.

            “The United States is poorernow.”
Yep, but such is subtly masked even today.  An example, housing.  My first home in 1980 was $90k at 13% interest.  Median home price was $40-50k at that time.  In 2020, the median home price exceeded $300k!  Median income in that time went from $20k to $50k.
I’ll let you run the numbers, but no matter how you run them, you can see that one of our time honor American tenets of “home ownership” has vanished for the middle class—even at 3-4% mortgages.  Our Trump 1 years of 2% interest merely masked the decline.

                    Of course.  Perhaps a better way to put it is that the America I talk about is the vaunted “middle class”, which is now destroyed—although they may not quite realize it yet.  80% of the wealth in the nation is in possession of the top 20% of the populace—really the top 10%.  The rest of the peonies can fight over the 20% left.  This is quite third worldish.
Disclaimer:  I’m doing just fine, but am not blind to see what my fellow citizens are facing in their “golden years”.  It disgusts and frightens me.

        As Jack Dobson wisely noted a few hours ago, many of the premises in today’s essay are not true.  The US is already poorer and far more lawless than a homogeneous citizenry would have tolerated in my youth.  All the complaints about the disappearance of ‘common’ courtesy, of competence, of cheerful and capable service – attest to the degradation of the public square.  The dollar is essentially worthless.  The government (yes, even the magic ‘local’ one) is sclerotic and/or alien.  The ‘rule of law’ has been a fiction for at least 25 years (yes, I personally would go back much further).Just what are we supposed to be preserving?  Personal safety and security?  The right of self defense?  The right to privacy?  The right to property?  These all have been perverted.  Wants now equal needs and rights.  Safety means Orwellian surveillance and living, speaking, and thinking in the shadows.  Privacy means the public parading of deviance and degeneracy.  Property means you’ve been unfairly ‘privileged’ and it will be damaged or stolen at will, and you will be decried as ‘greedy’ and ‘elitist.’I do not love the mob.  I do not believe in the ‘wisdom of the common man.’  The average level of intellect and ability in AINO is now so degraded that minimal effort is notable.  Nations have always been ruled by specific factions or groups or ‘elites.’  The fiction that we are or were a democracy just meant we didn’t have enough people with the power and means to enforce their views on others, although not for lack of trying.  The Puritans banning the Quakers?The Whiskyrebellion?  The War of Northern Aggression? Wilson banning German newspapers?  Prohibition?  Eisenhower using armed troops to force White schoolchildren to associate with savages?  I could go on and on and on.  Everything you were taught as ‘history’ was written by the victors, and is a lie.We did not move to the woods because we fear ‘peak oil,’ or nuclear war, or an EMP.  We moved because we no longer felt safe in our supposedly wealthy and safe suburb.  No one looked like us or spoke our language.  Our thoughts and beliefs were publicly anathematized.    I don’t long to be a ‘pioneer’ and live without modern conveniences – I have merely seen the increasing degradation of ‘public’ services and I no longer trust them to be available when needed.  Beingresponsible for oneself is generally considered the mark of an adult.  Well, it’s way past time for Merkans to grow up.Like it or not, welcome it or not, there will be a breakup and a cataclysm.  No state or political order lasts forever.  Ours had a goodrun, but proved fatally flawed from the beginning  – no, not muh slavery, but muh equality and the ‘enlightened’ assumption that reason and wisdom could rule mankind’s passions.Mankind is now diverse personhood, and it is insane and evil.  We are overdue a massive culling.  I fear for the future of my progeny, and still I say “Let it all burn.”

            Well said. Years ago I bought an AR-15 rifle. It’s still in its original packaging, unused and (hopefully) not rusting. As I don’t intend to fire it, I don’t have a cleaning kit. I don’t expect it’ll ever need to be cleaned: either in the happy case that it’s eventually sold as new or in the unhappy case…

                My recommendation is to fire it.  Possession is not the same as proficiency.  Once you pick up this weapon and expose yourself, you are fair game for annihilation, best to at least have some proficiency.  Otherwise you’ll be target practice for the other side.

        I’d just add two points to a great essay. First, Congress is to blame for overspending and forcing the Executive to jump over hurdles to rein it in. The crooked judges then frame this as a conflict between the Executive and Legislative branches requiring their intercession. Amazingly, the President can bomb whomever he wants (unconstitutional) but is forced to use trannies to drop the bombs if a judge says so.Second, legislation from the bench is completely out of control. If the Regime wants something, like abortion, gay marriage, domestic surveillance or Citizens United (corporate speech/campaign finance), they just rig some case to rise to the Supreme Court and fix it. The Founders never intended this.

        “If today’s reformers want to be winners, then these judges need to be made into losers, without making the rule of law a loser as well.”Depends on what is meant by the “rule of law.” The rule of what law? If it’s the law as an outgrowth of the common sense of the majority white population, that makes sense. If it’s the present convoluted garbage concocted by the Kosher Nostra, where we’re all supposedly committing three felonies a day, forget it. It’s not just the crooked judges that are causing the contempt for the law — it’s current law itself, and as practiced by fork-tongued liars.

        Since 2016, we’ve seen the collapse in trust of one managerial class institution after another. First, it was the media and Con Inc.Then, with Covid, it was the health experts – and, once again, the media. BLM and Covid caused many normies to no longer trust the police who kneeled to BLM rioters whiles arrest pastors for holding church services.Biden and Harris fully destroyed trust in the Dems.Now, it’s the judiciary’s turn. Sure, people on our side of the divide have known it for decades, but normies didn’t. They’re learning.Really, the only thing left, to some degree, is the military, though it lost a lot of its shine during the Forever Wars. The Blob has generally hidden our defeat in Ukraine via various lies, but a carrier burning in the Middle East would put the nail in that coffin.

            We are outliers in our opinions, and it always is best to keep that in mind, but the masses are slowly learning. The Regime apparently forgot, if it ever knew, that the American system relied very heavily on trust; this is particularly true of the judiciary. The Regime can and has used the force of arms since that trust evaporated, but after a point bullying and terror are countered. And make no mistake, the judicial tyranny being imposed is bullying and terror beneath a thin veneer of procedural niceties. There are elites with enough money now to raise armies and hire assassins and impose their own version of law. The death squads in Latin America bear witness to how that works, as an example. We are going in that direction and it seems to me what amounts to madness has precluded the managerial state and its judicial branch from seeing it.

        I knew some Russians in the 1990s. They had some crazy stories about how Russia was like then, and how shocked they were about the general societal trust and respect for the law they saw in suburban USA. For example, American stores would often put products OUTSIDE the stores, not locked or watched or anything. Удивительный!Then later when I lived in Estonia, the native Estonians told tales of roving gangs of Russians in the 1990s, as Estonia was getting back on its feet, who were stealing and raping. This could have been an exaggeration, but I don’t think so. Matt Taibbi has some good writings on what Russia was like in the Nineties, which confirms what I’ve heard.It’s no wonder that Russians love Putin and wish he was 20 years younger.

                Comment understood by the tone in which it was intended.  But to be serious – any woman who prioritizes an alien race’s children over her own is profoundly broken – and dangerous.  This goes for all those who adopted Han girls, and Guatemalans.  A cuckservative example is Laura Ingraham.  All the women who have ‘fur babies’ instead of real, White babies.  We are a profoundly sick society.

                        Yes. And rather than adopting children, a highly intelligent Nordic woman like Ingraham should be selecting an alpha chad and having children with him – using her intelligence to raise a stronger future for our people.

            Just look at the kids who ACB adopted. Trump should have disqualified her based only on that. Her ‘evolving’ views on the Court were entirely predictable. And now she’s likely to be the deciding vote that hands Trumps a bunch of losses on key issues.

                I think that was Z’s point. Courts were supposed to issue decisions, not rulings. I don’t know when we decided that lawyers wearing dresses are the ultimate deciders of all that is true and just, but here we are.
Until we see judges as the corrupt, vile crossdressers they are, there is no path forward.

        Boasberg and his whole family have made destroying America their life’s work. And Roberts put Boasberg where he is. Which tells you everything you need to know about Roberts, which tells you everything you need to know about the federal judiciary. Big surprise, when asked to make a ruling that diminishes their own power, the courts refuse to do so. The real mystery is how Alito managed to get up there. Who screwed up and let him in? They haven’t made that mistake again. And won’t, as long as they remain in power.Trump shouldn’t be afraid of ignoring the courts and making them irrelevant. It’s either that or admit defeat at their hands. What are they going to do, impeach him? Ha. But then he is not his own man. Controlled, handled.

        This is heavy hitting today Z-Man. You captured something that gets lost in the absurdity of the post-2016 reaction. That is that Trump initially was as much a revolt against the GOP establishment as the DNC. I heard Trump say a few weeks ago that that old Republican party is dead.It is easy to forget that at the same time Clinton was cheerleading TGR, offshoring, service-economy and incorporating foreign predation … … Bush/Cheney/Neocons were upping from the Cold War to Full Spectrum Dominance and massive military belligerence.This thing was way off the rails in the era of the Information Superhighway and The Fresh Prince Masking the OJ Trial Implications.This post-nation is a powder keg. Obama/Biden has fully destroyed the legitimacy of nearly every aspect of the core institutions. What is very evident is that the core of the middle and upper middle class – professionals – are deeply emotionally unstable and lack any intelligible capability on civilizational matters. Going on LinkedIn is frightening. The people calling the deplorables idiots and other names are checked out of reality. They are children. They are infantile and childish and they cannot see it. This is the grave danger. When the core that should be wanting to hold up civilization are so checked out into childish and infantile scolding and moralizing there is a vacuum. Instead of helping with all their might to push toward shore they are shooting holes in the boat and hauling up rocks on board.Nothing shows the incoherence more than the fiction in every image of how wonderful the diverse utopia is and this depiction of the reality on the ground in places like Baton Rouge where civilization’s collapse is fed on by savagery. In many places lawlessness is already the rule. Let us all pray that the reformers can pull this together. It is going to take those insane people on LinkedIn to grow up in a hurry.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBUF4lUFCsE

                Absolutely ProZNov. A while back some judges in Hawaii cited a TV show to support nullification of the 2nd Amendment. I think it was The Wire and the citation was of the criminal mastermind in that series.
To say this thing has been taking on water is an understatement.

        The courts have been politicized since the Eighties, when I worked in court admin.  The Great Gyno Wave rolled in from law school and begin filling judicial appointments.Even worked for a chick chief justice — decent person but deluded about the world, and about human nature, as females tend to be.  She was All The Rage in the nation tho!  lol  Watched the ‘family courts’ gleefully be weaponized by women, starting with separate created sections at the level of Administrative Offices for Judicial Councils.I neither trust nor permit a female (i.e., feminist) ‘judge’ to sit in rule over me.  It’s degrading and emasculating.  As is intended.Iniquity unchecked breeds unrest and war.  Some jive effort at reform won’t feed this bulldog.  Barky O’Blahma was right: America needs fundamental transformation.

                Yessir. No juries, no voting, no public offices. First things first — restore the fundament, which is the natural order of relations between male and female. Political stuff comes after.
The sexes are NOT equal partners; the woman is the helpmeet of the man. Not his superior, not his competitor, and damn sure not his ‘judge’. What an effing travesty of a nation.

            I must say you are far more right about this than I am. (Plus, your scholarship is tighter, your observations more immediate and practical.)How do we walk this cat back? I say remove the Pernicious Influence and the many social maladies it has brought to us (nearly all of them, btw); yours is a more practical “get through the defensive line before trying for quarterbacks”.I blame those who radicalize any group and exploit their foibles; as you have shown, the fact that women have had and will always have such foibles is what makes them, as the Zman said years ago, “the soft underbelly of society.”Mystery societies and sex magic are ever their forte, as it is with the Chosen.I note that women gain “independence” from government or government affiliated jobs. As Zman, again, noted, when women take over a corporate environment, they turn it into a matriarchal African village wherein the men are pushed out to the fringes and the institution made a women’s benefit society.Should we blame corporate capitalism for its exploitation of a service economy?Should we blame government for incentivizing blind loyalists and filtering out everyone else?Of course, I blame the wrecker symbiotes, but they are powerful near-peer competition who have successfully remained ensconced for millenia.I say kick their influence out first, but how, if we can’t even take our women back?———-As noted above, it seems the judaic Inner Council that brought Mao to power aged out or was pushed out, but only after the death of tens of millions, the abortion of a full generation, and Deng’s rise. First the gangs (the teenage Red Guard) was squashed, then the Party harridans somehow lost their power; were they replaced by men? Even so China has a problem with their golddiggers and ‘leftbehind women.’ (Each Saturday women parade in parks with signs listing their assets. But, not a civilizational problem, as the leftbehinds are aging out.)Now Russia, it turns out, went through a long period where judaic pedophile gangs sold children and oligarchs, a majority of them the “over-represented”, sold off pieces of SOEs, state-owned enterprises. Putin then simply sent in Spetsnaz to gang buildings to kill everyone inside, thus solving the gangster economy problem, a corollary to the Red Guard’s fate. The Russian women lost their government-affiliated sinecures but remain valuable workers in the economy; the problem there is trying to reincentivize motherhood and family formation.Kick out the malicious jews (instead of worshipping and protecting them), kill the gangbangers and to hades with corrupt “legal process” (a legacy of a vanished system), defund and prosecute the corrupted government institutions that give power to women, small hats, and nonwhites.That seems to be the core of Chinese and Russian reform; will such a total reform of at scale be possible, especially in a half White country?I accede, though, you are right in first steps first. Half of our women have been lost to, empowered by, and transformed as the managerial class. It is government mandate that brought them there, and their governance is lethal.We have to get them out of power before we can get to the small hats and nonwhites. Captured government, captured society; Eve is rightfully feared.(Please forgive the overlong and overly personal comment; the existential questions you raise vex me greatly, because you are right in this.)p.s.- perhaps the solution is to go full Irgun on the small hat oligarchs, hostile nonwhites, and bureaucrats; reinvigorating merit by martial prowess, the basis of monarchy and aristocracy, is key to resuscitating our younger males, and the women will flock to their worthy banner.

        It’s only tangentially related to the topic, but there is a book calledThe Five Stages of Collapsethat is well worth the read if for no other reason than its anecdotes about living through the collapse of the USSR.
Most Americans have so many assumptions about the way things work that are going to be radically challenged if the USA goes through a period of systematic collapse.

                Orlov used to live in Boston for most of his life, but about 6 years back, he packed up and moved to Russia. He noticed a collapse in intellectual environment in US and could not take it any more.
Orlov also says that the Soviet-style collapse already underway in US, but is happening in reverse order as of USSR. Therefore political collapse may come last, whereas in Russia it was the first step.

                Oof, sad but true:For Orlov, attempting to effect political change in a collapsing society is more than futile. Not only is political collapse unavoidable, but as resources further deplete, the methods of communication on which we have relied for so long will eventually vanish. He suggests that we could make better use of our time by learning some effective ways of communication that do not rely on the Internet. Of this he says: “And so, if you want to achieve a serious political effect, my suggestion is that you sit back Buddha-like, fold your arms, and do some deep breathing exercises. Then you should work on developing some interpersonal skills that don’t need to be mediated by electronics.”

        The missing link, only recently provided courtesy of Musk et al, is just how much free cash is sloshing around the DC system to fund the Leftists.  Now those rice bowls are being broken.  Already seen how many of these judges are connected to that spigot via wives, children, siblings etc. They ain’t going to go softly into the night…and would gladly burn it all down to rule over the ashes.

            Sad, but true. They’d rather burn the whole world down than have to move to a lower-class zip code. (As Trump would probably make a deal with some of them to not even have to go to jail.)I guess they want to make these rich neighborhoods of taxpayer money eaters while the taxpayers live in constant financial struggle. Third-world heaven to them, I guess. Americans probably pay for these type set-ups all over the world and these thugs see that it works there so why not here. They are invested in it working out in America, too, it seems.It’s like that snake eating its tail symbol and if they can make America a wealthy tax-eater/poor taxpayer third world they will have ‘won’ the prize, the whole thing, and the snake will finally have eaten itself.

        This a compelling post – I agree that the managerialism of the 20th century is coming to an end, and that this is very confusing for the (small) portion of arrogant old people still trying to cling to a system and world view that has not been relevant for a while.The reason it’s coming to an end is technology.  Social media has destroyed the 1-way I speak-you-listen communication channels of the old way of talking to the public, and a different kind of elite (with different talents) is selected in response.  The Revolt of the Public by Martin Gurri is instructive on this.  AI, and other tech (zoom, slack, bots, email, internal process systems of all kinds, etc.) enable much flatter organizations; you no longer need 14 layers of management in a massive hierarchical bureaucracy to run at scale.  For orgs unwilling to change, new companies are being built faster than ever (a result of the tech mentioned above) to disrupt and eventually destroy them.Even in the tech world, I don’t think the above was properly understood.  I think a pivotal moment was Elon buying Twitter, going in and laying off 75% of the employees and 2 years later…. the thing still runs.  Better even.  Whoa. Combined with AI, combined with a new type of leadership where you hear directly from Elon, Trump on X, combined with massive loss of legitimacy from the old system during COVID, combined with AI, etc.  Meta has done massive layoffs this year, same with Google (how are there almost 185k employees who work there?!), Amazon is supposed to be laying off 14,000(!) managers this year.The old managerialism is dead; a new system, with a new type of leader, is replacing it.

            I lack enthusiasm for AI. Elon’s description of the future with AI sounds like a particularly detestable dystopia. Robots and AI do the work and the government sends money to all those who are no longer employable. It sounds worse than communism, where at least  people still worked. It’s the sort of thing that appeals to billionaires (no more wages to pay) but is otherwise nightmarish.

                Respectfully, I disagree.  I don’t think work automated by AI and robots is inherently noble, and in the long run it’ll be a relief that humans no longer need to perform such work (similar to work that was automated in the past and no longer needs to be performed by humans today).
If done right, I think this latest wave of automation will lead to a future where many less humans are needed – which works well with current demographic trends and eliminates need for mass migration.

        The parallels with the Soviet Union are indeed similar in many respects, though we should bear in mind that bankrupt evil system staggered on for decades before finally collapsing under its unsolvable contradictions. The United States is well on its way to the same fate, the bridge is oscillating wildly now, the camel is staggering under the weight of so many straws, but as has been noted before “there is a lot of ruin in a nation”. We are the richest most powerful nation ever seen, so that’s a lot of ruin to work through.The big question is whether the change will be slow, taking years of gradual decline, or fast, happening in perhaps a couple weeks. Since Americans like to do everything fast I know where my bet is.

            The collapse already happened and we haven’t acknowledged it, like in movies where the protagonist “doesn’t know she’s dead” and the increasing implausibility of her surroundings is the world trying to tell her it’s over.It’s almost always a woman, because not many filmmakers can make the audience care what happens to a man. The great exception isJacob’s Ladder, which never makes it onto anyone’s list of the fictional dystopias we currently inhabit. (The twist makes people forget the rest of the movie, ironically.) There as here, the world ended in 1971.If our collapsestartedthen, as some economics- fundamentalist types think, and it hasn’t ended yet, then it hasn’t been fast at all.

            I vote for faster rather than slower. Russia wasn’t full of recent arrivals when the Soviet system was collapsing. I expect the immigrants to cause even greater chaosdue to their opportunism and greedwhen the system starts to fail. Many will turn to crime or fraud when the corporate system that brought them here fails them. Those Indian IT workers will be stealing credit cards and birth certificates – even more than they probably are now.

        It seems so crazy what these judges are doing, basically telling the citizens yes, we don’t care who or what you vote for, we will take your money and enrich our families and friends with USAID/NGO monies (probably the tip of the iceberg), and we will flood your towns and cities with foreign gangbangers, and give them your money, too. While the citizens suffer more and more every year and many can’t buy a house or even a car or afford to go to the dentist or doctor.It’s almost like some of these judges are purposely exposing themselves, maybe a deal that was made with them that they can’t refuse? Some are just traitors and their aim is to weaken America for wherever their allegiance lies. Some are true believers and think since these other judges are giving them cover and legitimacy, they are going to go hog wild on their misguided beliefs.But I mean c’mon the 2016 FISA judge popping up and saying look at me, look at me. It seems forced. Is he the pied piper leading the rest of them to exposure thinking they have cover? Something seems strange about this. Why would they expose themselves on these issues? Foreign gangbangers and an audit of USAID and the NGO’s stealing the people’s money. Why would they go hard and expose themselves like this? Seems like a stupid hill to die on.

        The only people who care about something like a high trust judiciary are right of the divide White people, mainly the men. The only thing anyone else cares about, including fellow Whites, is whether these rulings help them.Flooding the country with people from low trust societies was brilliant. Of course, in the long run it will prove to be a disaster but in the meantime it frees the elite up from acting in a legitimate manner.These judges will never rule against anything helpful to Israel so they provide a check on anything that Trump wants to do that goes against Jewish interests (E.g., replacing whites) while allowing him power to help Israel.

        A couple of things maybe off topic, but interesting/amusing:
1. The French media said it, then Candace Owen said it and now Tucker Carlson is kind of confirming it: Brigitte Macron is a man. Emmanuel Macron was groomed.

2. Somebody posted this graphic on another page and this is the sort of thing that must drive the managerial class crazy about the internet. They just can’t control the narrative anymore.

            Except therepukes are not genuinely nationalist, nor many of the other positions attributed to them.  I believe it is important to distinguish between ‘patriotism,’ which now means supporting and defending the existence of the US bureaucratic state and its laws and mechanisms, and genuine nationalism, which means supporting and defending the heritage American people.  I was a ‘patriot’ back when I was a conservatard.  I am no longer.  But I am a full-on nationalist, because so long as the people survive, they can build another (and hopefully better) state.  The whole “notsees are . . . ” is tiresome.  It’s not left versus right – it’s nationalist versus globalist, or the sane versus the satanic.

            I’d say Hylton. That was when the judiciary decided the Constitution did not mean what it said, that pretty much everything is a valid federal power, even though the words on paper say the exact opposite.

        Yeah, but the Judicial branch would prefer to rule over the ashes, so…The best they can do it probably something like what they’ve done so far: ignore the rulings while claiming to adhere to the rulings and point out that a ruling that is an overreach is not a ruling at all. It won’t work, because it turns out Roberts is really an idiot (or else blackmailed by Team A, but that’s the same thing).Here. We. Go. If Trump has the stomach for it. Patel thinks he does have the stomach for it and is changing his security team to men who are not FBI.

            Trump is now spending most of his energy trying to deal with the foreign forever wars that he was supposed to end. He needs to get back to his REAL job which was sorting out the domestic front. And where that is concerned your are spot on. This is THE big one – where we finally learn if DJT is the real thing or all hat and no cattle. I have no idea which way this is going to go.

        “The challenge, as with all reforms, is in dealing with the problem while not undermining the legitimacy of the system. These judges think they are heroes defending the system against the monster, when in reality they are a cancer threatening the last functioning part of the system.”Sage words.  However, these judges are part of the problem.  They were appointed in the absence of “merit”, they are political appointees/apparatchiks.  No more, no less—except that they now operate according to rules not normally found in politics, but rather the old “rule of law” where meritocracy and judicial independence was protected against undermining by political concerns.  Now it is quite the opposite since they have assumed power.  They are now protected from accountability as they work toward political goals while wearing the “skin suit” of administration of “law”.I see no way to mend such a system once corrupted, but to wipe it out and begin anew.  To do such would seem to necessitate a plunge into strong man rule as the system is expunged.  Was it any different in modern examples such as as the USSR, Chile, Spain, heck I’d even argue Weimar Germany?

            The point was to bring the issue for a SCOTUS decision as soon as possible.  This was not a miscalculation.  It was a gambit to produce binding decisions while the Court was in his favor.  It might fail, but it is the best chance the conservatives have had in 50+ years.

                I wonder what Clarence Thomas would have been like on the Court if they wouldn’t have personally trashed him the way they did.  Maybe he would have been exactly the same, but there is no way George HW Bush would have appointed him knowing he was going to be this far right. As with Trump it may have been another case of the left’s lack of restraint backfiring on them.

                Spot onre the ‘message.’  But as you know, don’t put your trust in normie.  He will back the strong horse, or whomever best protects ‘his’ social security and 401k.  He will tolerate just about anything as long as it maintains the pretense ofrules and order.  When pushed too far some normies may lash out as a mob – but they are never an organized force for dramatic and systemic change.

        This column explains why you don’t impeach the judges.  You use your control of Congress and the Presidency to descope the size of the Federal court system (fewer judges, less mischief) and remove certain topics like immigration from their jurisdiction.SCOTUS could not possibly handle the Lawfare waves of lawsuits.  So you strangle the courts, but you don’t get rid of them because you still need the law for legitimate purposes.  And you don’t impeach because that helps destroy their legitimacy.Congress creates the inferior courts.  Congress alone can boil off the unnecessary parts.  That which remains is blocked from things like nationwide injunctions and meddling in immigration enforcement.When it comes to the courts, I think the GOP could pull this off.They have to.  These same judges are going to facilitate election fraud in 2026.  Better neuter them.  Better hurry.

            Columbia is a diseased slag who needs to be put down and buried ignominiously. This will involve immense anxiety and suffering among AWFL Americans, Jewish supremacists, conservatards, and grillers but the slag’s death is a necessary condition. She has no good or correct form.
It’s btw that it was the lawyers who established the courts in India, and without the courts the English could not [have] rule[d].

        I wonder if Trump will take a page from the FDR playbook and threaten to (or actually do) pack the court.

            I think we are was past time for packing the court. Some of these district judges need to disappear, without a trace, and the entire DC court system needs to be done away with in its entirety.

                What you do is take the DC Circuit and reorganize it out of existence, while shrinking the size of the rest of the system.  Then merge some of the appellate courts as well.  Create bottlenecks, make it difficult to create mischief.  We also need to limit their jurisdiction and remove their ability to issue nationwide injunctions.  Hose are all things that Congress can do.Will they?  Maybe.  The GOP is generally hostile to the courts.  And the matter of court overreach is so severe at this point – unelected dictators in robes – that the Senate can implement the nuclear option to pass reforms using 51 votes.
