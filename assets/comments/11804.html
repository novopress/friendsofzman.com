        The more things change, the more they stay the same. And the older I get, the more I realize that all of politics boils down to Two Rules:
(1) It’s always about the money.(2) When they say it’s not about the money, that means it’s about a sh**-load of money.

        “….The thing with Hillary Clinton is that all of her scandals over the years have been about money……..”True.And also true is that the Clinton’s are above the law.She and Bubba have never been investigated, indicted, tried, etc. . They literally could commit murder and their powerful friends within the  govt/media/legal profession circle the wagons and protect them.Copious quantities of $$$$ + political power = immunity from any and all laws (but only if you are a democrat).So, this latest revelation is just another re-wind of the same old Clinton corruption/scandal movie.No need to get your knickers in a twist folks;  the Clintons will emerge from this scandal totally unscathed – you’ll see.Bubba will continue to rake in big $$$ giving speeches (I am simply dumbfounded that anybody or any organization would voluntarily pay to listen to him speak) and his bull-dyke, psychotic “wife,” Hillary will be granted interviews on TV all over the the planet (as if ANYTHING she says is worth listening to).Really, this is F’n unbelievable.

            I would agree with you if any other person were POTUS, but Trump has to see that examples need to be made.

            Both will be dead soon, so a fuller picture will emerge in the coming decade. Political corruption in the South has always favored a model where the proceeds are spread out among many people. It’s a lot like how the Mafia would “protect” the neighborhood so the neighborhood would protect them. It often works like that in the south. The big man gets the first taste and the biggest taste, but everyone gets a taste. That makes it hard to police.I suspect that is the model the Clintons brought to Washington. They got everyone in on the action. It’s normalized now. No one rats on anyone, not even across party lines.

                Since I am quoting movie lines today.In the Road to Perdition Tom Hanks confronts Paul Newman on killing someone close, Newman says:There are only murderers in this room.
I suppose that’s how the political parties view corruption.

        Most likely, the FBI and Mueller investigative teams have come to the obvious conclusion that there is no Trump/Russia concern, and so somebody in the FBI has “leaked” this information in an attempt to resume the earlier investigation.  I sincerely doubt that it’ll happen seeing as how “off limits” the Clinton Foundation has been.  That corrupt scam of a charity is the Harvey Weinstein of D.C. politics: everybody is in on it, a lot of very important and powerful people stand to be taken down by it, and if the dam breaks at the Clinton Foundation, heads are gonna roll by the dozens in D.C.There are too many people in all wings of the Government Party who stand to have their careers and fortunes destroyed if the Clinton Foundation were ever subjected to something resembling legitimate scrutiny.

            We are long overdue for a massive scandal. Abscam was the late 70’s and early 80’s. There were the HUD scandals of the 80’s. Other than some Kabuki theater, we have not had a lot of pols going to the can since the Clintons arrived in DC.

                This is one of those areas where Trump shows his naiveté about politics.  He could flip a switch, and Sessions and the FBI resume this Clinton Foundation (and email) fraud.  He could agree to shut it down if Mueller closes up shop and goes home.  Once Mueller closes up shop, press on with the investigation anyway.
The narrative in the last 10-15 days has shifted to “25th Amendment” and Trump is “unstable”.  The Russia investigation is unofficially over as a pretext for removing Trump from office.

                    Alternatively, Trump may be holding some cards for later. His negotiating style has always been a variation of the nibble. Instead of making one grand deal, he strikes a bunch of small deals, holding out the hope of the big bonanza. He may think it is best to hold these cards. That may be why someone leaked this story to the Hill. Keep in mind that The Hill is nothing but leaks from Congressional staffers. This story came from Congress to pump some attention into their upcoming hearings.

                        Many knives are out for Trump, so he just might be holding back the most damning stuff for leverage.  The closer he gets to quitting or terming out, the more dangerous it is for those who oppose him.  A guy who has operated successfully in NYC for decades knows exactly how the games are played and must be very good at it.  That he can go that long and not get easily muddied up in any substantial way is extraordinary.Beyond that, I have always viewed Progressive accusations as projection, and a fascinating view as to how those people think and operate.

                            I just don’t see that “go in for the kill” instinct in Trump.  A lot of the people around him are a) New York libs and b) long-time Government Party types (e.g. John Kelly).The thing about the Clinton Foundation is that none of those people wants to look under the hood.  Over in the Senate, it’s just politics, so the Senate can have these committee hearings that are quickly brushed aside.The Clinton Foundation = Harvey Weinstein.  They still have enough money and power to keep people from taking them down.  They still are playing the card that Hillary will be back in 2020, so nobody wants to cross them.  On top of that, a lot of the loony left still thinks Trump is going to be “removed”, the election results invalidated, and Hillary “installed” as the rightful President.  So that keeps the $$$ in the coffers and the Clinton’s out of jail.It would really only be if the Clinton Foundation and CGI really started to collapse financially that the long knives would come out.  Other than in “paranoia media”, there’s not much sense that CF is going away anytime soon.  They only have financial disclosures up to 2015 available on their website, which means if there has been a big impact in 2017, we won’t know about it for 2+ years.In 2015 they raked in $299M in donations and grants.  2016 was very likely a BANNER YEAR for them due to the election.  Their best year in the last decade of course being the stretch when Hillary was Secretary of State, then the revenues declined before ramping up again prior to the last election.Half a billion dollars will last awhile.

                                The Clinton Foundation and CGI will not collapse.  Their budgets consist almost exclusively of paying all the pilot fish that provide various services that make the Clintons and their friends comfortable.  Most of them probably work for almost nothing, as they are promised big things later if they do well.  The budget for such things will be expanded or cut back to fit the situation.  It’s not like these entities have a fixed production payroll to meet.

                                I am guessing that the Clintons are behind all the media and chat room speculations about Hillary’s claiming the presidency from Trump or running in 2020.  The grift can’t keep going if the reason for it appears to be drying up and going away.

                        My guess is the issue is timing. Trump is going to release the Clinton/Obama/Uranium info in two tranches, the first in the run up to the 2018 elections, the second in the run up to the 2020 elections. I just hope he has enough control over the justice department to pull this off.

                The most obvious exception to your observation about the dearth of politicians going to the clink would be the hapless Rod Blagojevich.Blago made theHUUUUGEmistake of crossing Chocolate Jesus in his own town, and one has to suppose that Blago was told, in no uncertain terms, that not only was he going away for 14 years, but if he uttered as much as aPEEP, his wife and daughters would start to disappear.Nothing else explains the silence coming from Rod since his own side sent him away. This is, let’s remember, a man who prior was famous for running his mouth.

One of the surprises of this ( why should I be) is the authority given to a department or official. ” authority to approve foreign energy deals”No temptations there, huh?

        A more likely possibility is that Rosenstein was corrupted and appointed Mueller with the understanding that Mueller would bury any evidence that might expose the pervasive corruption at the Department of Justice during the Obama era.Nobody held a gun to Rosenstein’s head and forced him to appoint a special prosecutor. Once he decided to proceed, Rosenstein could have appointed anyone he wanted to the position. And somehow Rosenstein decided that the best person to lead the investigation into alleged Russian interference in U.S elections was Mueller, who headed the FBI during the relevant time period.We’ve seen this play before when Jamie Gorelick was appointed to the 9/11 Commission in order to cover up the role the Clinton DoJ played in providing cover for terrorists. The fact thatThe DoJ is thoroughly and completely corrupt and needs to be completely gutted. The corruption began in the Clinton era and was perfected in the Obama era. This was Jeff Sessions’ biggest challenge and, so far, his biggest failure.

            Also note that the hedge fund run by Chelsea Clinton’s husband collapsed in December 2016.  It had racked up huge losses on Greek debt that had been well-known for months.  I am convinced that, if the Clintons had won, they would have ordered various crony-capitalists to “invest” enormous amounts in the fund, thereby keeping it alive for at least four more years.

        I’m no stranger to corruption (I’m Irish and live in South America), but I’ve come to accept the reality of it, however lamentable (a favorite word where I live) it may be. I was born in and lived many years in the USA and in spite of the obvious, it continues to sadden me that the USA has become sooo corrupt that my contemporaries the Clintons continue to get away with… well, what might even include murder for hire.

            Long and short, No.The US was founded on slavery for cheap labor  treason to evade taxes and genocide to increase land. And while yes Liberty all that , its more about having a mileau in which screwing people over is easier. That this happens to allow real economic growth  is more accident than designWe kind of ran out of room and opportunity to everyone has a little side thing now.Once corruption sets in deep enough  it becomes the new permanent social model , throw in a society where many  people are atomized and don’t even have enough loyalty for amoral familism and you have a recipe for corruption on an epic scaleThere is no reason not to be as corrupt as you can stand since honest labor just gets you screwed over. in game theory , everyone else is defecting all the time.worse with so few people really rooted into society and many people not even having family to threaten and increasing less regard for life or ethic, things are going to get interesting in the Chinese curse senseSuper empowered people wit a grudge and a DNA synthesizer or hacking tool should scare any sane person since the possibility for destruction is Mandalay Bay  x100 or moreIt may  make the almost certain bullets, battery acid, pliers and blow torch future seem peacefulThere is one caveat, a  non democratic regime with a rigid moral code a rabid hatred of corruption and enough power who was willing to use all the tools down to export system monitoring could break the back of corruptionThis will have huge economic effects of course, when India dropped the hammer on corruption, a lot of people who knew no other way ended up basically doing no business and of course Sarbanes Oxley helped contribute to killing the IPO since people were expected to behave in an honest and conscientious manner , well and that it was a complex regulation with real teethif such a regime grabbed power, kept it, used it , hanged a lot of people and deported a lot of people from low trust countries, we could hugely reduce corruption and after a few decades , be very honest if somewhat poorer.

        Well, can personally vouch for the description of the Clinton Foundation/CGI.  Did a lot of “cleaner” work in my old firm…one assignment was vetting CGI when two large trading partners put the arm on us to join.  Had to attend two meetings (including the one where Chelsea introduced Braverman), plus a pitch session over at the 6th ave. offices.  This was simply a bundle and skim operation–the sales pitch was all about “access to decision makers”.  Cash flowed in, favors flowed out, and the entire Clinton lifestyle was “Foundation business”.  The trick was gracefully declining, nothing in their finances met any of the firm’s requirements.  Entry price was $350k + getting solicited to “sponsor” projects and events.  Everybody floating around the meetings was either on the make or the take. The most curious thing to watch at the second general meeting was watching Bill and Hill in the same room.  Bill has magnetism and fills the room…problem is when both are on the same stage it simply highlights her grating, wet dishrag personality.

            I worked the other side of the CGI fence, trying to get a small grant for electrification and water purification work in the middle of nowheresville Africa, back about 2010 or so.  CGI gave us the polite runaround and deferred decision making, without actually telling us “no”, and with no guidance as to how to follow up our application with any meaningful information that could be used in their process.  There wasn’t actually a process that I could detect, just an on-line storefront that made them look good.  Our app and project were lean and tight, with little room for graft.

                    Some relatives were doing the work in Africa and thought this was a good way to add to the capitalization (especially as the financial commitment was high risk and the project would look great on the CGI resume).  I did some foot work on this end, but found that there was a black hole where the application process was supposed to be.  The old Hollywood “don’t call us, we’ll call you”.
After I made the post, I thought about it myself, it looked rather ridiculous, once it was all laid out in black and white.

                Doesn’t surprise at all.   And one of the crimes was the number of people floating around at these meetings looking for funds that probably were never going to get a dime, but it made a good show for the Clinton’s benefit. From the other side we kept asking for metrics on programs but got rope-a-doped.  And what data they gave really was just stuff that was subcontracted.   More efficient to give to that org directly.   And the meetings, between plenary sessions would have these Seinfeld-esque ‘working sessions” on problems like “community resilience”.   And the membership model was a pyramid scheme.  Companies that go sucked in were expected to go out and recruit their business partners.  The political problem was having two multi-100mm trading partners pressuring to join in the scam, though rudimentary due diligence showed it was….a scam.  Finally, when it became apparent that the old show pony Hillary was trotting out for another Presidential run we begged off on the excuse we did not want to be wrapped up in partisan politics.

            Sam;$350k_?  Wow, price sure went up.  I was slightly involved on the (far) periphery when The Clinton Crime Family was just getting started on a national scale.  Our firm was invited to send a rep. or two on Commerce Sec. Ron Brown’s ‘business promotion’ trips for a mere $100k per each per trip DNC donation in the early-mid ’90s.  I was queried as to what business for us might be promoted.  A quick look at the itinerary showed that the obvious answer was “None.”  It was clearly a junket for any senior exec’s with nothing else important to do to act as transfer agents to sluice shareholder money to the then gearing up Prog. parallel economy.  As is typical of the Clintons, this was completely done at taxpayer expense using USAF aircraft.I like to think that I saved some EVP’s life since a later flight ran into a mountain near Dubrovnik in the fog. Once on the plane you had pressure to stay on for all future trips.  Why Dubrovnik_?  There was no business for any of the passengers there but the Adriatic coast was lovely that time of year.  My surmise is that, on account of his high paying passengers (and to show off his power), Brown pressured the pilot (a junior AF Capt.) to go around and try again despite the local destination airport lacking nav aids and being well below minimums (hence against regs to approach).  Brown paid for this with his own life.  Too bad about the others.

        The main significance of this story is that the cancer of corruption is now at Stage 4 in Washington DC. Virtually all players and power centers are fully complicit in selling out the country for personal gain (politicians, media, law enforcement). It’s insane to cross your fingers and hope for a white knight to arrive and clean things up. Even if someone took down the Clintons (which is not going to happen), you can’t cure cancer by taking out a few cells here and there. We’re still in the denial phase.

        This is strong evidence to support the idea that the Russians, even if they did meddle in the election, would have backed Clinton and not Trump. The Russians owned Clinton, she had been bought and paid for. As President Clinton the Russians would have had this incident to threaten her and say, “If you don’t go along with us on this policy/action we will let it be known that the monies paid to Bill and the Clinton Foundation were bribes.”  They would have no such leverage over a President Trump. The Russians would have been better off under a President Clinton, and they knew/know that.

        As a connoisseur of Chicago politics in my youth I always thought that the Clintons Inc. lacked the sense of proportion and self-restraint of the the Daily Machine.  The Daily’s practiced ‘honest graft’.  You want something special, you pay one guy one time, otherwise it’s business as usual.
This is why Chicago didn’t resemble the 3rd world at the time (but now_?).  There you have to pay everybody all the time until you get big enough that everybody has to pay you.

            To quote a friend of mine, “Under the Daly Machine, it cost ten times as much as it should to get something done, and when it was paid for it got done within ten or twenty percent of the projected due date, or heads rolled – into the river.  (And then it got done very fast indeed for no extra money.)
Now in Chicago it costs twenty times as much, and it doesn’t get done, and heads don’t roll.  No one should wonder why Chicagoans are nostalgic for the old regime.”

            The Arkansas Borgias no doubt are in possession of a Burn Book of epic scope. They will not go down without a nukefest. PDJT is the wild card-just wish he would awaken AG Sessions from his coma.

        The funny thing is, what does Hillary do with all that ill gotten lucre?   Nothing that I can see.  Lives in an ok house, but nothing special.  Wears clothes made out of carpet samples.  Gets drunk early and often.  And that’s about it.  But that is the nature of madness I suppose; mindless behavior for it’s own sake.

            Great point!  She has more lucre than any 1,000 average people put together, and yet she is a miserable old wretch, by her own choice.

        I have no confidence that anything will come from this. The Clinton’s are like Teflon. Nothing ever sticks to them. Which tells more about the wholesale corruption of our justice system than it does about their criminal personalities. This is why I have faith in God and heaven, becasue it will literally take a supernatural and divine court to see these two and others like them receive true justice. Otherwise, they will just have the last laugh on their death beds, having cheated the very system they were suppose to uphold.

        Screwing around with Russia and the Crimea, and playing regime-change games with countries that aren’t just the provenance of inbred sand people (i.e. the Ukraine) and doing shady deals involving uranium, sounds like a recipe for something to go very, very wrong. I’m not ready to build a fallout shelter, but what if (consciously or unconsciously) the adherents of the prog religion are secretly hoping to bring about the eschaton, to destroy the world now that the anti-Christ Trump is in ascendancy? I forget who said (paraphrase) religions can survive without Gods, but they need devils. The derangement syndrome caused by Trump makes the liberal mindset during the Bush years look sane. I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that Hilligula and her Praetorian guard in media, education, and politics (especially the female cohort) are so enraged that their chance for matriarchy was undercut by pale penis people that maybe they would prefer to see the world go down in conflagration literally than admit they lost or accept the consequences.

        Progressives have a habit, an instinct, for accusing their enemies of crimes committed by ProgressivesThat is so true. Look at the latest “me,too” campaign on Facebook. So another rich powerful liberal, this time a Hollywood titan and Clinton supporter, behaves abominably towards women, and now the focus is on what scum men are in general.

        Prediction:  This investigation, like all others involving the Clintons, peters out after the expenditure of uncounted funds with no definite finding of culpability.  Clintons declare themselves as having been found completely innocent.  Like OJ.

        Most of the story is not new information.  We already knew about Uranium One, the $145 million to Clinton Inc., the $500K speaking fees for Bill, and Hillary’s sign-off on Russia acquiring control of 20% of our uranium in return.
I suppose the new information adds a bit of depth and detail – but the only question that really matters remains: IS ANYONE GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?
