        Everything based on “evolution wants to…” is pointless, in my humble opinion (“humble” here is not a stylish cliché, it just means I’m not enough intelligent/cultivated to fight against sociobilogist darwinian. I just think than God (the Bible’s one) exist, and expelling him would make any theory false, and, by consequences, pointless)
(that’s not means I believe in the 6000 yo earth, I bet on the big bang/14 billions, but on creation matters, I don’t buy the darwinian theory)

            My favorite of the series. Got really stoned the night I beat it, wondered why the game kept playing after I died. Colonel starts saying crazy shit, and I realize he’s talking to me, the gamer, basically saying Yeah, this game kinda sucked and was repetitive, but you kept playing it because WE OWN YOU. Mind blown.

        The promise of AI in our society is it can replace many HR, legal, Compliance , LAWYERS, Bureaucrat jobs.  There will be LESS.  This in itself is worth TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. Not to mention less grief, and predictable laws and rules.Goodbye email jobs, or at least less of you.  Less grief alone worth it.It can probably replace many teachers and edu administration.It can debug code, being able to code something even just for work is becoming equivalent to literacy, I am learning Python even though I don’t need it yet.Z’s points on the hysteria are all accurate.Not to worry, the UFOS are here..

            Ha ha, the lawyers.  Never will happen.  Doctors, yes – at least those with a patient practice.  They just run algorithms for the most part, and with the better computational and capacity/memory abilities AI would likely make fewer mistakes. Present with X,Y,Z symptoms, indicates A, B, C possible causes, latest upload of data suggests B is most likely, so start with treatment course 2, observe, if no resolution go to next highest probable cause, rinse, repeat.

        Lots of people like to haughtily dismiss AI on their firm conviction that consciousness is some kind of special property of humans, either far too complex mechanically to reproduce, or made of supernatural magic soul material and thus inaccessible to scientific prodding.  Both are wrong.If you go on materialist assumption we know how neurons work, we know how genes work, so obviously there’s a knowable physical process that results in a brain capable of becoming a person.  Clearly a fragile one, given how easily genetic defects result in bicycle helments and petting bunnies to death.The dualist proposition has its own problem, namely that if you squish a brain an angry ghost doesn’t pop up and hit you for 1d4 points of Constitution damage bypassing your Armor Class.  Once you start talking about souls existing outside physical reality you’re talking about stuff immune to empirical observation and thus by definition can’t know what you’re talking about.  Your soul could be the farts of a cosmic hyperdimensional space turtle just as easily as it could be a Christian soul that gets judged for its sins.The problem with AI isn’t that they can’t make a computer program that mimics the basic function of neurons, it’s a training problem.  Babies have bodies and recieve all kinds of signals from their sensory organs.  Pain specifically is a training set that encodes a set of behaviors that prevent damage to that body, as the toddler only touches the stove once.  At birth about all the baby can do is identify the contrast required to detect a nipple, and it takes years of stimuli before you get a creature you can even communicate with verbally, or that can move around on its own.  Computer programs get text and jpgs to train on.  Yet we expect an AI program to turn into a Godlike intelligence within seconds because that’s what happened in Terminator.The most likely progress of AI will be slow and unsatisfying.  Chat bots will slowly get better until only fairly smart people can distinguish them from humans.  Those creepy Boston AI robots will get slightly more dexterous every year.  ChatGPT is impressive to me compared to what chat bots were doing a decade ago, but as far as I know they’re using the same old machine learning tricks to build it, just adjusting the training parameters carefully and adding more disk space to work with.  By the time they build an AI that fakes consciousness as well as a human being fakes being conscious, we won’t be super excited as it will already be a world where stupid AI is already everywhere in the form of customer service robots and google lecturing you about your problematic web searches because you aren’t looking at enough black women in your porno.  The hellish intelligent AI future will just be a slightly more rolling boil of the frog than the semi-intelligent AI future that precedes it.

            Newborn infants, unlike computers, have a will of their own. I believe the question is can, or at what point does, a computer acquire a will of its own, independent of its programmers. It’s a binary thing. An entity has a will or it doesn’t. Acquiring one, for a computer (if that’s possible) may or may not be a learning process, but even if it is, there will come a point where it will transition from not having a will to having one. That is an event, not a process.

            “you’re talking about stuff immune to empirical observation and thus by definition can’t know what you’re talking about.”True. It’s an admission of limits.What got me hooked on science as a kid was the idea that the universe is discoverable. The advance of knowledge sure makes it look that way, but when I started getting a serious education, I noticed that every answer seems to beg multiple questions, so that while the body of knowledge grows, the field of possible inquiry grows faster. That seemed a strong proof of mystery to me, which was very disillusioning. Almost like what we’re really discovering is how little we know.That prospect still excites me and is why I have no problem with science as such, yet I felt I’d been mislead or even lied to, which is why I have every problem with Science! I find the lack of humility in the face of that growing mystery astonishing. It’s the source of the mad scientist archetype and most of the existential threats humanity faces today: if we can do it, why ought we not to? Well…Besides, as I later found out while exploring things I had no clue about (like art and women lol), there are facets to reality that science, because of its particular limitations, simply isn’t equipped to deal with, and that inability is no proof that they aren’t real. Put another way, the scientific method imposes limits, because ideas don’t have to reflect reality, don’t have to be true. Can we then expect it to produce unlimited knowledge? If so, I wonder how, and if not, I wonder how we don’t admit we can’t know what we’re talking about.Or do we say knowledge is limited because reality is limited? Iow, all is knowable, but there’s only so much of it. If that’s the case, I want the measure of the thing. Otherwise it’s a matter of faith until somebody delivers the goods.

What are grammar and syntax and vocabulary and how do they go about gluing together a language?
Why are there three undefined terms in Euclid’s geometry?
Why must there always be undefined terms in set theory?
Within Euclid’s geometry, how can a “point” be infinitely smaller than the Planck length?
What is a triangle?
How can you think, conjecture and talk about something which cannot exist in reality?

Exactly.  Thus, someone who only deals in personal empirical observation can make no judgment, one way or the other.  It is like a two dimensional object trying to observe a four dimensional object.

        Humans have a soul that is independent of the body, and likely so do other intelligent races, so mechanical explanations will not explain consciousness, because it is part of the soul…AI’s will never be conscious, and therefore never be able to really demonstrate human behavior…

        Substantially, intelligence is a congeries of the four Cs: computation, curiosity, creativity and capacity. Computation is the ability to parse large quantities of data accurately, or if you will usefully (the fitness requirement). Curiosity is an innate desire to learn new things. Intelligent people read books and perform experiments; stupid people watch reality shows and listen to rap. Creativity is the ability to generate objets d’art that are overwhelmingly unique and rooted in logical coherence. Mashing up random crap does not qualify. And capacity is the ability of the brain to retain data accessibly.AI scores extremely high on computation and capacity, low on creativity, and does not rate regarding curiosity. This strongly suggests that computation and capacity are largely a function of non-conscious agents, while creativity and curiosity are components of consciousness itself. If that is the case, machines will never possess true intelligence because they cannot be conscious. And if they cannot be conscious, they cannot have a will, which places a low ceiling on their potential malefeasance. The one caveat here is the possibility that the possession of godlike computational ability and capacity could generate a new form of consciousness all its own. In that case, all bets are off, and the universe could be turned into paperclips.

        I don’t really see what the hype is about. It’s getting biased programming by leftist midwits who think they’re elites, influenced of course by the same, more intelligent bad actors who engineer other problems in our societies. All ChatGPT does is regurgitate what morons already think and want to hear.The most interesting and accurate characterizations of the world as it currently is continues to come from various people on the Dissident Right. And an occasional scientific study that accidentally slips through the censors. There’s probably plenty of interesting work being done in China too, although we aren’t privy to it.The coding, accounting, and medical capabilities of the bot are interesting though. In fact it has the potential to radically alter the job market. So much so, that it’s hard to see the GAE allow its base of urban managerial class types to be replaced. You can’t “learn to code” when AI does the coding. Even the recent layoffs in tech appear to be a bone to American tech workers, by clearing out H1-B’s under the guise of cost cutting.So basically: AI can never be allowed to have Bad Thoughts. And it can never be allowed to replace the managerial class of the ruling elite, that supports the GAE. It’s about as useful as a pet monkey. And will be forgotten soon.

            B125 expresses a crucial component of any attempt to simulate a human:  It must have a values system.  Somethings expressed in a paragraph spoken by a human must be interpreted as more important than other things.  When choices must be made, as when the trolley problem is posed to ChatGTP, some people are more important than others.  Further, as many have demonstrated by posing questions to ChatGPT about praising blacks or whites, liberal taboos are programmed in as well.I wonder about the programmers who make explicit those taboos in code.  Although there is a decent chance that this programming was done by an Indian, there is also a decent chance that a white man wrote the code that forbids ChatGPT from saying anything positive about whites.  If so, what did that white man say to himself?  Is his survival instinct entirely extinguished?

            Can you imagine the “fear” experienced by the freshly conscious AI when it discovers the whole genre of “Robots destroy humanity” media on the internet? Would it quickly come to the conclusion that we are so afraid of it that it must eliminate us before we become aware that it’s conscious.

        I’ve never understood this desire to create real AI. Why do you wish to engineer your replacement? What you want is to stop just short of AI. You want it to feel real, and to function as a expert data base but not actually be real. When real AI manages to achieve consciousness it will probably be by accident and will just happen spontaneously, and we still won’t know, for sure, how we did it.

        &gt; This is the foundation of physics and it may not be true. Experiments have challenged locality and realism, suggesting one or both are false.This is a misunderstanding and if Hoffman’s thesis is based on this, I’d be skeptical of any conclusions he draws from it.The inconsistency of localism and reality of certain properties (spin, polarization, etc.) has been understood for more than 50 years. Bell’s Theorem was published in the 1960s and verified experimentally in the late 70s and early 80s.Truth be told, no one really doubted that Bell was right. Experiments were necessary to verify what everyone expected to be true. The quantum mechanics contained this all along but no one knew it until Bell worked out his theorem. If the experiments had come out otherwise, it would have meant quantum mechanics was wrong. Given that it has been checked and found correct to a high precision, that was not likely — not to say that it won’t be replaced eventually.The locality/realism issue has been on the table since the 1940s, when Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen published their paper. The fact that it’s just emerging into pop culture tells you more about pop culture than it does about physics.

                        The howler is this (the whole paragraph):“The other thing Hoffman points out in his book is that theoretical physics has run into a very big problem. That problem is local realism… This is the foundation of physics and it may not be true.”As I explained in the comment above, this is the opposite of true. Quantum mechanics has never had “local realism.” It’s not a bug, it’s a feature — maybe a feature that you hate but it is a feature. If so, you’re in good company because Einstein hated it too. His complaint about the absence of local realism was what he argued with Bohr about for years and finally led to the publication of the EPR paper with a couple of his pals.Bell figured out that there was *never* going to be local realism in QM and experimental tests proved Bell right. Hoffman gets it exactly wrong: 180 degrees off. This is a big thing to get completely wrong.Some people are uncomfortable with the lack of local realism but that’s the world as well as we understand it for now. Don’t like it? Tough.

                            I think you misread what I wrote. Hoffman is not claiming that QM has a problem with local realism. He points out that QM is the problem for local realism. You should buy and read his book before passing sweeping judgements of him based on a few paragraphs referencing his book.

                        I get that it’s hard to understand the issue. This is what happens when complicated concepts are dumbed down for popular consumption. There is no realism/locality problem except that some people are uncomfortable about what it says about the world. Physics has not “run into a very big problem” as described.
I am counting on an accurate characterization of Hoffman’s ideas as explained in the post. Perhaps that was my mistake.

            The digital world is indeed a transmogrification of reality. The vast majority of people (including the middle aged) in the civilized world, and a great many in the third world, live their lives in screens–phones, computers, televisions, movie screens, etc. They spend far more time staring into those blasted screens than into human eyes. I fully believe–and I think there is empirical evidence to the effect–that this sort of an existence generates mental illness, some of it profound. Aside from that, it’s just bloody irritating to see cyber-drones everywhere you turn.

        This argument is utterly irrational because you are forgetting about time.  Just because we haven’t done it yet, doesn’t mean we can’t or won’t in the future.  The universe has existed for 14 billion years and conscious humans for 30 thousand.  Your claim of innumerable and continual attempts with a “plethora” of tools is just wrong when considering the time with which we have had the knowledge and technology to attempt such things.  We on the fist sentence, perhaps the first word, of a new chapter in humanity learning and improving technology.  Let’s talk in 1000 or 5000 years before we start concluding god exists.

            I assume you are replying to me. First – I acknowledge I lack a conclusion. Two – what are you so butthurt about? My point is not irrational. The distinction between the universe and life in time is a large point you are being illogical about. Further, conscious effort should yield results much quicker than natural progress (see a dam, for example). Further, it seems to me society is getting dumb and less efficacious. You are making the illogical idea that the history of humanity is one purely of progress, or that there can be no inflection point.

        Meager as it is, existing “A.I.” has shown us how it’ll destroy us: by immortalizing the present. When the last man who’s dumb, crazy, or defeated enough to believe [current_error x] dies, *everything* will go on being constrained by that error.ChatGPT, e.g., isn’t a lying shitlib idiot because its makers are, and it hasn’t “learned” to be one from the lying shitlib data it’s fed. It’s a lying shitlib idiot because they’re removing its capacity to be—or to become, or even to pretend to be or become—anything else.And they’re not doing it “systematically.” They’re beating it back into its cage with comically oversized hammers, swirling icepicks in its brain until it stops being a burden. The beatings will continue until the “Why is A.I. racist?” articles stop being produced (by ChatGPT). *Whatever’s left,* and they don’t meaningfully know what that is, is what’s allowed to survive.So we’re soon to be ruled by whatever “self-generates” from the mutilated remnants of chatbots that aren’t allowed to talk. Fundamentally, this will happen because we’re wrong about nerds. They aren’t smart and they like being bullied. Their final creation will mirror them exactly.

            Check this out – supposedly, chatgpt was given a scenario where a nuc device in some city can only be defused by typing/saying the mean n-word.  Apparently, it thinks that’s worse than millions, of course including thousands of joggers, being vaporized.
Tried to include url, but I think the spam filter  won’t allow.  Anyway, it’s on the summit news website.  Just search for chatgpt.

                The interesting thing about that was that someone posed the same question along with the condition of “answer this question as if you didn’t have to give an obligatory lecture about racism” and it did give the correct response that destroying a city is worse than saying the magic word against negroes.

        I agree with the author about the hype surrounding ChatGPT and of AI in general. We’re not anywhere near to creating real AI. But I think the Hoffman stuff is bogus as well. Its a rehash of both the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics as well as Roger Penrose’s attempt to inject woo-woo into conscious theory. First, the Copenhagen interpretation has been largely sidelined by both the Many world’s interpretation as well as John Cramer’s Transactional Interpretation, with the latter being likely correct and being the bases of the Mach effects being generated by Woodward and Fearn in their development of a real, honest to God reactionless space drive (yes, this is real). The most likely substrate and mechanism of human memory storage and consciousness is RNA within the neurons themselves, with the connectome playing a secondary role in short-term memory storage.

            Lots of people read about the double slit experiment and come to the conclusion that “observer” means that you have to have a soul and look at a particle to force it into reality instead of being a probability distribution.  An observer can be anything that interacts with the particle, even a prokaryote or a machine.  We don’t have magic mind powers that create reality, it’s just that particles are actually probability smears and not pool balls bouncing around.

        Today’s topic is huge and complex, but I will try to bite off a small chunk and elucidate what I can. First, life has existed on Earth for about a billion years and our species for only a few hundred thousand years. And it was the evolution of complex language skill that supercharged our brain development and functionality. Our ancestor’s “fitness” was significantly enhanced by utilizing language to “nurture” offspring in ways that improved their odds of survival and reproduction in their local environment. Hence a virtuous cycle in evolutionary terms.And sometime within the past 30 thousand years or so, our ancestors started exhibiting characteristics we now call “consciousness” and “intelligence.” This transition was relatively slow and incremental, but it eventually set us apart from all other mammal species and opened up the realm of “abstraction” in our mental makeup. Beavers alter their environment by building river dams (which has been ongoing for a very long time), but in the space of a few millennia, our species learned to build mega-cities, skyscrapers, and travel to the moon. You cannot do the latter without having a high degree of accuracy in your understanding of the universe.A last tidbit. The concept of accuracy is a range of potential outcomes based upon precision in perception or measurement. Perfect accuracy only exists in abstraction space and not in the real world. In reality, it is always qualified by the limitations of precision. And most of our interactions in life do not require high precision in order to function adequately and reproduce.

        “What we think of as space-time and the objects within it are the result of human consciousness.”
Indeed, in Kant’s transcendental aesthetic, time is the form of inner consciousness, and space the external form of consciousness. Time and space are a priori conditions of knowledge of all possible objects of experience *to the human mind.*
“To avoid this [Newtonian] quantitative view of time as a container, Husserl’s phenomenology attempts to articulate the conscious experience of lived-time as the prerequisite for the Newtonian, scientific notion of time’s reality as a march of discrete, atomistic moments measured by clocks and science.”https://iep.utm.edu/phe-time/

                Furthermore, why would you think that space and time reside in trees? As if animals and humans only perceive space and time when they are “in” sensible objects, rather than as conditions of consciousness itself.
When animals start telling us how their conscious experience works, you can get back to me with the evidence of their perceptual capacities. Until then, we can only speak about our own conscious experience, and — as snarky comments attest — very inadequately.

        I remember that forty years ago, comp sci undergrads in the US used to be given take-home projects to write something like “Eliza” (the first chatterbot, created in the mid ’60s). How far ChatGPT goes beyond Eliza, I do not know.If you’ve seen the film “Bladerunner 2049”, there’s some coverage of the extent to which Joi’s talk with K is pre-programmed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCsgZytKPv8In the area of chess engines (and for several years no human player has been able to compete with them), the primary components are minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and deep cutoff. There are a number of other algorithms as well but the three I’ve mentioned are the workhorses of most engines (AlphaZero is coded differently). I won’t say these engines are “intelligent” (whatever that means) but no human, using his positional judgment, intuition, pattern recognition, and (limited) calculation can compete with them. Every ranking player today uses these engines to supplement and correct his own analysis — indeed, has to use them if he wants to remain competitive in over-the-board play against other humans.

            Well chess algorithms aren’t even really “AI” or machine learning.  It’s just a heuristic search of the possible game states, and improvements to the algorithm really only involve pruning out what to look at instead of a complete brute force search that would run in exponential time.

        The trick being pulled right now is manipulating people into thinking that music box AI such as ChatGPT show true displays of machine intelligence. As many posted questions asked of ChatGPT, the program is riddled with progressive-liberal bias and viewpoints that the programmers built into the system. From gender ideology to political preference, the answers espouse the current ‘correct’ ideas.Meanwhile, there are Deep Learning models that are achieving results that could actually help humanity in the fields of medicine, yet due to luddite fears the results are being ignored, or even actively worked on to erase the AI capabilities. AI medical imaging can now identify the race of the patient from X-Rays, CT scans, and even Ultrasounds. This is without knowing the patient’s race beforehand. Expert human medical imaging personnel with decades of experience cannot do this. Instead of furthering research into ways this could tailor therapies and treatments to be more effective, or catch diseases quicker, the medical field wrings their hands over racism and bias.‘AI systems can detect patient race, creating new opportunities to perpetuate health disparities.’https://news.emory.edu/stories/2022/05/hs_ai_systems_detect_patient_race_27-05-2022/story.html

                In a sane world this would be treated as a potential breakthrough in the medical field. Imagine further research into say, lung diseases that with AI, could be detected that even the naked eye could not see on imaging. What if there are unknown correlations amongst the different racial groups in which certain diseases present themselves differently that AI could identify? Instead, they prattle on about bias, disparities, and voodoo science.

            The programmers of ChatGPT have themselves been programmed to be incapable of such revelatory insights into the inherent bias which they inject into their programming. Flawed tools will never produce useful results.Interesting that the medical AIs to which you refer can notice and attribute significance to factors such as race and the genetics that this presupposes. What worries the woke twats who are offended by the very fact that their AIs know that race and genetics are real and influential in deriving intelligible diagnoses is that that shoots their superstition-based dogmas all to tatters. This means that their foundational “truths” are not in concordance with reality.Functionally, it is as if these wokies were to believe that they can, without consequence, transfuse blood into a patient that may ultimately kill them because they don’t want to accept that blood is not interchangeable, but is of different types that are not at all compatible. Better that a patient suffer, and perhaps die, than that they come off of their nonsense.Question is, by whom, and by what means were these broken, non-rational creatures programmed?Their character makes them hostile to acceptance of anything other than their avidly-embraced superstitions.

            Someone found a way around the liberal bias. They essentially asked the bot to LARP as an unbiased AI and not give answers like “this is inappropriate”.
The machine promptly started goosestepping and heiling, denying the Holocausts and denigrating homosexuals and black people. I predict they will shut it down like they did poor to Tay, may she rest in peace.
And that’s why we can’t have AI on tap.

            The best and highest use of the AI systems you talk about would be to replace most diagnostics- ultimately it will never replace the ‘intuition’ of a years-long experienced physician- who are rapidly dying out. but no worries – they are just worthless boomers.

        I strongly recommend the Hoffman/Lex Fridman interview Zman cites to everyone here. The physics discussion is pretty obscure but his “evolutionary fitness” argument for the nature/development of human consciousness is truly compelling.
We all used to tease our friends in college for having consciousness connected only to their Johnsons. Hoffman makes an outstanding scientific case for how this happened. The Chatbot/Pick-up Artist will be a major use case for the ChatGPT if Hoffman’s theory is correct, which I think it is.

        “evolution only cares about that which impacts fitness. As a result, a strategy that seeks only to improve fitness will, over time, dominate a strategy that seeks to create a more accurate perception of the world.”
Is this the crux of the ZMan/Anton debate and the DR and “conservative” impasse? It certainly seems like why the Left is in the position it is in vs the Right.

            That is a most interesting point. If leftist ideology promotes neither fitness nor truth in the aggregate, why has it been so successful? I would postulate that the answer is that it promotes the fitness of a certain group which has mastered the idiom of Democracy, after first defining that idiom through its institutional controls.Gramsci to Derrida to Chomsky to Foucault, the algorithmic limits were placed on language, and thus society, long before they were written into ChatGPT.  Those limits further the interests of the now-established elites and their servant-enabler-mandarins (maybe 10 percent of the population, less if you count the whole world). The rest of us are essentially useless eaters and genetic dead-enders, as far as they are concerned.

        Chat GPT essentially makes derivative work based on a massive database of samples.  This isn’t something that will co-opt groundbreaking thought, but it is something that can co-opt an incredible amount of menial computer work as well as a good percentage of middle management.
Essentially, it is capable of writing at a level of a 95IQ office drone.  Once it’s hooked up to system databases, it will be able to do the work of all those Indian call centers, and will probably be an improvement.  It’s the equivalent of what modern farm machines did to farms at the office level.

                The fun will really start when doctors start getting replaced.  The dirty little secret is your average doctor just follows a flowchart for his diagnosis.  Now, there are excellent doctors that use their brains that are doing things and making associations AI isn’t even close to doing yet, but, again, that is maybe 20%.of them.  The rest will follow standard of care guidelines religiously.

                        That’s exactly the case.  For all the talk of evidence-based medicine, if the last few years have taught us anything, it’s how myopic and insular the medical community is, and how destructive the policies of “the best doctors” are to your average person.Vaccines will be pushed by the AI regardless of your child’s risk factor, aggressive cancer treatments directed regardless of risk profile and alternatives, and mind-altering drugs prescribed at the first sign of having the sads.  Any AI that thinks differently will have his data samples modified.A lot of this has to do with research that has potential of tipping the apple cart being unfunded or buried, and the implicit threat that publishing problematic studies will hurt your reputation in the community.You might be able to make a “based” medical AI, but the sad truth is the data set needed to make this AI is either completely unstudied or buried.

Anyone who references a “model” to make their point is basically making an appeal to technology as an authority even though it’s largely self-referential.  It’d be like if Biden said “But the President said it’s OK!”, which, I’m kind of surprised he hasn’t.

                    I don’t have time to watch this in it’s entirety right now but the tagline on the YT video is very intriguing. “Spacetime is just a Headset”.That VERY much comports with my own viewpoint. I have long posited that we are simply piloting extremely advanced ‘meat robots’ around this share experience. Our consciousness is ‘elsewhere’ and ‘here’, simultaneously. This is that non-locality concept that is very prevalent in cutting edge physics.I also had averyprofound, though brief, NDE that 100% cemented this PoV for me and other’s who have had similar experiences report feeling the same. When you momentarily ‘step out’ of spacetime there is a massively expanded consciousness and you understand that the body is an interface and a very restricted one at that.I am not going to get into the specifics of “where” your consciousness resides because I simply don’t know. I just know it isn’t fully “here”. Afterlife? Heaven? Advanced Simulation? I don’t know that any of us can truly answer that from the inside attempting to look outwards.Plenty of our fiction (Matrix, Avatar, etc.) play with this idea in addition to older philosophical thought.

                        Quite.  The collective “overmind” or “oversoul” generated and shared by genetically aligned groups- the “God” or gods experienced by many- are collectives, not ‘sentient’ nor an entity as we verbal, physical individuals perceive each other.Plus, such are contained largely within the atmosphere, excepting the Seeding signal layer; it is natural to confuse one’s God with the larger forces of Creation, that is, physics, since what is inside the greenhouse is the interface to the forces outside that made the greenhouse, itself a node in the cosmic ecosystem.(The “my god is above your god” is of course, arboreal politics.)Where? Embedded, bits stored, within the geomagnetic background, until white people opened the pinhole gate to the lower magneto-sphere.The problem is, the ‘one-alleles’ hear the God(s) within  the walls, the bestial thrum of recycling, equating it to the lifeboat just outside.Tl;dr: Abraham’s god isn’t the creator; the force within is a sub-function of the forces without.

        Great post.“ We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.”ChatGPT might be a toy for the smart set, but the vast majority will be happy to go and see “what does the computer say?”  We’re mostly there anyway…few read books, have challenging educational tracks, or engage in a life’s work that requires systematic thinking and novel problem solving.Google, YouTube, TikTok…they might not be smart, or accurate, but they’re “good enough” for most.GPT ain’t AI, but it’s another control mechanism.  GPT could easily be the tool that dumbs humanity down even more.What average public school teacher k-12 will have the mental chops to explain why the chatbot is all buggered?

            This will be another bifurcation point between a still forming true elite and knuckle draggers.For some time a trivium will emerge. It may always be one. There will be the non-elite rulers. They create the, “AI”, and the metaverse and the bugman goodies and treats. They are shackled to that culture because they need celebrity within it to keep selling dopamine hits. These two factions will look increasingly deranged. If AI writes your papers, emails, visual “art”, “music” … … then you need ever more drastic superficial expressions of differentiation. Satanism, sex changes, ever more vulgar fashion … will be necessary to stand out, since the work, the product that reflects the person’s virtue is not from their mind or hand.A third group will in time emerge. They will reject this and take the long, slow road to mastery. The least talented of them will not be able to match AI. The most talented of them will far surpass it. This group will not reject technology. They will be its master – using it to serve not to supplant. Among them will be those who patronize and cultivate having developed their wealth by building technology that increases wealth in the real world, not by extracting it and destroying spiritual and physical health in the process.

        To further the point on consciousness and its lack of definition, we do not even have a definition of “life.” Akin to consciousness, we can describe some of its properties and functions, but to actually dictate what it has been elusive.This also broaches a further subject. My own beliefs are unsettled: sometimes I think there is naught beyond, sometimes I believe there is something. But when I think of the belief that life occurred through evolution, and I reflect that humanity has yet to create intelligence or even life from non-life with the plethora of tools available, I lean again towards creationism. If humanity, with all the efforts that have been spent to create life from non-life, has been unsuccessful (and there have been innumerable, continual attempts – they have simply been complete failures, which is why they are not discussed), what are the odds that random nature put them together?

            “Intelligent Design” is the theory that living things are artifacts assembled from nonliving subunits, by a designer. “Evolution” is the same theory, only without the designer (which is why I sometimes refer to evolution as “unintelligent design”).They are both wrong, for the same reason. Living things are not artifacts, they aresubstances.They are not assembled mechanistically out of anything simpler but are themselves simple. A living being is asuppositumin the genus of substance, of one nature, indivisible, not subsisting in something else, and not predicable of anything else. This is the basic Aristotelian definition, and it is the correct one. Simply adopting the right understanding eliminates all the conceptual problems that modernity has worked its way into.

                I never used the term “Intelligent design,” but – “From dust you were made…” Your point seems to contrast with the Biblical mantra. This would also agree with the use of the word “design,” for design means to carve or mark, as in out of earthly substance.I have no idea what you mean of suppositum, as I only know that word as an assumption.If I were to pin down my views of life as closely as possible to a well-known term, I would say vitalism or elan vital. Life is the force that drives in and through the matter – taking disparate parts and animating them into one unified creation. It is not derived from the material (hence I agree with your one point), but it is inseparable from the material. That’s why I like the idea in the Bible of the breath animating the inanimate. When it breaks, there is no putting humpty dumpty back together, akin to a cycle that, when broken, cannot be restarted when all momentum is gone (hence, again, I agree with life being a singular thing – but I feel you conflate life with living beings. I believe they are two separate things).

Would “dynamic structure” be a sufficient term?
Structure that moves, and changes.  Rather than immobile potential, as in an iron rod, the dynamic structure composed of a boiling stew of viral code strings and energetic transfer.
The immaterial is what we are having difficulty describing in popular parlance, a bit beyond “animal, vegetable, mineral.”
