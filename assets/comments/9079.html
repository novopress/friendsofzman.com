        Well, that brings back some memories. I too wanted to “make love, not war” when I was serving overseas, but somehow it didn’t work out that way.
Still, though me &amp; Arlo are politically a long long way apart, I will always have a fondness for this ballad. Oh, and hold the pickle!
Happy Thanksgiving, Zman! What a wonderful blog you’ve built, and I certainly give thanks for that, and a Happy Thanksgiving as well to your wonderfully erudite commenters, who have taught me so much!

        I’m sorry, but every time I see one of the Guthrie’s it reminds me of Huntington’s Chorea. But this will be a happy Thanksgiving anyway. Bless us all.

        What a sense of humor Arlo had with that song!  “Drats, foiled again!”  But the lessons about the powers that be are still relevant today.  Even with Trump at the helm, the beast is still capable of crushing our spirit and our soul.  Half the country is dedicated to doing just that and using the government as their heavy hand.I thank God for the breathe of fresh air we are enjoying today.  It is palpable.  Let’s all take  some deep breathes and exhale our CO2 and make the lives of those who want to destroy our way of life miserable.  “In your face!”

        Happy Thanksgiving and thanks for so much for all your keenly observed and timely essays Zman.I look forward to every new post, as well as the excellent comments that accompany them.BTW, I first heard Alice’s Restaurant live on WBAI-FM on the Bob Fass’ show,where it was first introduced to the public.This was before it was recorded commercially and of course, it then became a huge counter-culture hit.WBAI was the lefty Pacifica ‘alternative’ radio station in NYC.Fass also introduced the first radio performance of Jerry Jeff Walker’s Mr Bojangles.Funny what sticks in one’s memory.The 60’s were interesting times to be young, dumb, etc….https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Fasshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice&#x27;s_Restaurant

        Happy Thanksgiving to all Americans from all of us up here in the frozen Canadian north, so cold we have to give thanks in mid October.
And I hope everyone knows that Arlo Guthrie became a Republican in about 2004.

        This is a historic year in 2016. Thanksgiving is a time of reflection on that year for me, and I look back and find many new and unexpected reasons to give thanks.  I share these thoughts inhttp://www.michaelfmartin.com/all-the-new-reasons-to-give-thanks/. This is a damned good blog too, so I say with much appreciation, Happy Thanksgiving.
