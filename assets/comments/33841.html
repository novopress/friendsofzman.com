        I do not followJohn Derbyshire enough to understand his full sentiment with the “It’s time for us to take responsibility for the defence of Europe!” segment. The face value take is that this is a bad case of compartmentalization and living in the past.The point about a post-national ruling class leading America and Britain into a civil war between identities is that the American and European ruling classes have destroyed any sense of true unity that is worthy of defending. They are fully deracinated and have attempted to make the people they rule just like them: a fully transactional and predatory conglomerate of power and wealth.You see this with America’s foreign policy vis a vis the Arab nations of the Middle East. They bribe, they threaten, and then they bomb to “send a message” until they get their way.The only army* that a transactional and predatory people can field is a mercenary one, because bribery is the only tool available to them.Contra Mr. Kubilius, the 450M EU citizens combined with the 340M Americans will never defeat the 140M Russians. Russians are Russian and loyal to the survival of Russia. There is not nearly enough wealth in all of Europe and America to field a mercenary force equal to Russia’s military might.That is before we move to the 21st Century where wars are additionally fought with domestic energy and manufacturing capacity. The fully transactional, fully predatory ruling class has gutted both in favor of a financialized economy that allows them to be fully transactional and fully predatory.*The exception being zealots from the Zionist cult, but that force has an expiration date.

            Putin has been reduced to begging the Norks for help after he ran out of prisoners to use as cannon fodder. About 800,000 Russians, most of them Russia’s best and brightest, fled the country since the invasion.  And Russia’s fertility rate has dropped to 1.4. Don’t get me started on the alcoholism.“Russia’s military might,” indeed.

        The senate holding a hearing about itthe very next day,after the news broke about the Signal chat, tells you everything you need to know. As far as I can tell, nobody outside the Beltway cares. It doesn’t engender a lot of confidence in the “deep state” that they haven’t updated their playbook much since the Nixon era. Funny how nobody is asking why “we” are bombing Yemen. It is apparently just taken as a matter of course, normal state of affairs, that we are.I feel certain that not a single person voted for Trump with the hope of joining the British commonwealth. And probably pretty close to the same number desired to annex Canada. Although I doubt they’d have much of a problem taking over Greenland, even if they hadn’t really thought about it. Personally I think a takeover of Canada could work if it were brought into a polity ruled by a white nationalist strongman who was busily deporting every wog, mud, negro and chingchong, but would be a disaster if Canada was made into just another set of electoral districts in our “democracy.”

            The only interesting thing in the story was Vance’s comment about the wastefulness of military action on behalf of Europe.As a matter of capitalist/numerical fact, the “maritime chokepoint” that the Houthis threaten is Europe’s. America ships almost nothing through it. If it’s terrorized into ade factoblockade, it costs us nothing. Bombing it open is waste on Europe’s behalf—to a neutral observer.That’s not at all how the American government thinks of Yemen™. To them it’s a crusade for Israel.Vance appears to have learned about it by reading about it, instead of being told about it. So his opinion about it isn’t insane. (It’s also not real, because it’s Vance.)

            Correct. This entire scandal is a phony one. No one was harmed by this Signal leak.Jeffrey Goldbergis an Israeli agent. He supports the bombing of Yemen. By all means, we must strengthen our communications security, so that there are no more leaks. We have been too lackadaisical. But nothing bad happened this time.And you are right about Canada. No Trump voter wants a trade war. And we certainly don’t want Canadians voting in our elections. They’d all vote Democrat.

        maybe I’m not cynical enough, or maybe I’m even gullible. But sometimes I wonder if a movie like top gun maverick was purposely made to make Americans  FEEL America still exists when it really doesn’t.

        We are doomed! In just 5 years you say? I know an author who made a similar prediction more than 15 years ago.
But for the number, 5, plus or minus, no clear headed thinker could say that such a forecast is unlikely. It has happened before, it will happen again. Civilization today is ever so much more fragile, vulnerable. There were no gain of function biolabs or electricity or nukes or cyber criminals, the internet, only just a few centuries ago. Crossbows, spears, triremes, gunpowder, hand grenades, napalm, all pale in comparison. Major defects in the human genome.

        If we must tolerate a USA with a president, let the president of anewUSA be selected in a less ridiculous way with fewer ridiculous openings through which to slipa turdinto office. We could, for example, select the president once every five years from among the governors of the “States”, that is, the provinces which we have been pretending are states.Hecould be selected by a vote of the states’ own senators. The Beltway will have no input, nor shall any person who has ever sworn an oath of office with a promise to uphold the Con of AH and his fellow fools.Or the president could be selected at random, again from among the governors.Hemust have at least two years experience as governor, be thesonof native born parents, and have been elected without a single vote or peppercorn of material contribution from Jews, except as suggested below.Just to be clear: Only males are qualfied. All queers and other black lives will be exempted. Only men of our breed are eligible, except that there may be no Jew who lacks a long track record of denouncing the nation of Israel and its state (if any), and campaigning for the extinction of the Israels. Masons, Freemasons, Zionists, and fellows of any and all similar organizations are ineligible.The oath of office will include a Latin phrase affirming that Zion must be destroyed, except possibly forFort Antonia, a western wall of which appears to be a popular shrine for Levites and Jews. (The claim about the temple’scompletedestruction needs to be investigated again and confirmed. Jesus said it would be so, did he not?) The constitutions of eligible states must affirm the need to destroy virtually all of Zion. AH’s toxic Con and ridiculous quadrennial circus need to go, and the City of Washington will be given an appropriate new name.

        As someone with British heritage, it is extremely sad to witness the course Britain is on.I have also noticed the plethora of interviews that Professor Betz has been giving in recent weeks. He and Louise Perry are both new to me as well.At this time I would recommend listening to only one of Professor Betz’s interviews because his current spate of talks are very similar.Or, as recommended in the podcast, head to Mr. Derbyshire’s site and simply read the transcript.For me, Louise Perry is pretty good on most issues. I concur that she has a pleasant manner and voice. YouTube has tons of short clips featuring her for those interested.

            “As someone with British heritage, it is extremely sad to witness the course Britain is on.”What informed man in his right mind would expect otherwise given the past five hundred or so years of British history?? Consider just for a moment the following sovereigns.Elizabeth – a childless woman with a Heebish name on the throne for more than fourty-four years in a realm called a kingdom. Women are unfit for such a position, and the men of England are still making liars out of theirselves by refusing to speak a correct name, e.g. Queendom of England, for the realm during her reign. It’s btw that she was not the first female to be installed on the throne.James – his name is an extreme corruption of Jacob, that is, יַעֲקֹב‎, indicating deracination and subjugation under the cultural and national imperialism of hostile aliens. He was on the throne of England for twenty-two years and on the throne of Scotland for fifty-eight. Preceded in Scotland by a deracinated woman who was queen for more than twenty-four years. (Scottish men, too, it appears like to be liars.) He was likely queer, and if so surely unfit to rule.Victoria – another unfit one on the throne, this time for more than sixty-three years. A less dishonest title for her is Queen of the United Queendom of Great Britain and Ireland. By the time of her death the British male’s habit of delusion and self-deceit cannot by written off as a fleeting character flaw.Elizabeth the Second – yet another unfit soveign. On the throne of a “Kingdom” for more than seventy years. Few honest men dared publicly to call the realm of her time the United Queendom of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Her slimy, eldest son betrays no part of the manhood needed to speak out against the dishonesty of his mother and the typical British male.So, just these four account for more than one hundred-ninety nine years of the past four hundred sixty-seven years. What is 199/467 written in decimal form? How much when converted to a percentage?The “United Kingdom” has an expiration date, and it’s 2053 ± 7 years. William will be about 71, should he live that long.

        Great as Shakespeare is, I never lose sleep over anything he said … By the same token nobody ever feels guilty about anything Plato or Aristotle said … We aren’t tempted to resist them as we are tempted to resist Christ(Subtracting Christianity Sobran pp. 1-2).

        Here’s a UK political item that’s a perfect example of the issues Betz discusses:https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/04/01/crowdfunding-a-proper-inquiry-into-the-rape-gang/It’s worth mentioning that the author, Rupert Lowe, was until recently a member of Reform UK but was forced out. Leaving aside the entirety rational suspicions of jockeying for power, which is inevitable in political organizations, it remains a fact that the UK has studiously ignored the burning issue of the rape gangs. Lowe mentions some of these background issues, which is pretty bold of him. It’s even more eye-opening that this article appears inTelegraphwhich remains one of the top UK news organizations.The UK government has known for decades that (primarily) Pakistani ethnics, whether immigrant, naturalized or born there, were involved in the so-called “grooming gangs” which exploit young White girls into lives of prostitution, drugs, and other misery.There are charges, apparently not without reason, that government at all levels has been reticent to even acknowledge, much less crack down on, such crime, primarily since it would be seen as “racist” etc. to demand that a volatile minority obey the nation’s laws.Knock-on effects of these policies have, not surpassingly, led to varying degrees of White social unrest, protests, further distrust of Muslims and of their own Government.Government has already responded to the legacy population with ever-harsher measures including rigorous censorship on social media, arresting suspects on the slightest charges (“non-crime hate incident”) and convicting and jailing some solely for statements made on social media or non-violent actions at public protests.Government seems to have decided that, rather than address chronic issues, it is more expedient to discourage the aggrieved from even complaining. If necessary, by marginalizing, fining or even incarcerating them.These, and many more, are prime examples of what Betz discusses and are the ominous mileposts on the road to civil war.

        It doesn’t take an “expert” to realize that the Signal fiasco is inexcusable. Anyone with the slightest common sense or basic knowledge of DoD security procedures would instantly realize that any conversation involving sensitive information should take place only on secure devices in a secure location using a secure network with secure, non-commercial software. There is someone responsible for this, find them. There’s a lot more involved here than just placing the wrong person on some list.

        im getting a lecture:Attraction is subjective and can differ greatly from person to person. In the context of Top Gun: Maverick, Jennifer Connelly’s character, Penny, is portrayed as confident, intelligent, and independent, qualities that can make someone appealing regardless of age. Physical appearance is only one aspect of attraction, and many people find qualities like personality, intelligence, and life experience to be just as (if not more) important when it comes to relationships.Additionally, in Hollywood and in real life, there are many examples of people in their 50s or older being portrayed as attractive and having relationships with people of various ages. In Top Gun: Maverick, Maverick’s attraction to Penny likely stems from the connection they share, not just her looks.

        eh , no
To estimate Penny’s age in Top Gun: Maverick, we can assume she was around 20 years old in the mid-1980s when Maverick and she briefly dated, placing her in her 50s by the time of the 2022 movie.
So, Penny’s age in the two movies would be:• In Top Gun (1986): Likely in her early 20s (based on when Maverick and Penny were romantically involved).• In Top Gun: Maverick (2022): Likely in her early 50s.

        According to Wikipedia,Andrius Kubiliusserves as the“European Commissioner for Defence Industry and Space in the Second von der Leyen Commission”– whatever that means.What he said is true, however. Europe does have the resources to defend itself, if they want to. But they don’t. They are too decadent. They subsidize phony “refugees” invading their countries. This will destroy them worse than anything Russia can do.Jews &amp; their tools rule Europe. They are now plotting to import 8 million Negro “refugees” from Africa, and settle them in Ukraine. They want to turn Ukraine into a Negro state, thereby killing it. They think that’s funny. Ukraine would be better off as part of Russia.

            Ukrainians are profoundly retarded people. Take the stupidity of the average Polok and add that to the stupidity of the avg. Irish American papist. This is the idiocy of the avg. Ukrainian, which exceeds that of the avg. Englishman and even the USA’s ASPy, slow progressives who call theirselves “conservative”.

        You can totally rule out the possibility Jeffrey Goldberg was in any way responsible for the breach–If the administration thought there was the slightest possibility that any outsider was at fault, they would have called in the FBI immediately (which they should have done anyway, to determine the extent of the damage and whether any laws were broken). Handing the matter over to Elon is exactly the sort of thing you want to do if you want to pretend that you’re doing something.As far as I know, Elon’s people are not law enforcement officers and have no background in criminal investigations. Good luck getting any evidence of criminality admitted in a court of law after they’ve been doing who-knows-what with the phone(s) before an actual criminal investigation was opened. The only conclusion that can be drawn under these circumstances is that Trump’s people are either totally incompetent or don’twantanyone prosecuted, possibly both.

        Top gun maverick is on tv now. I remember when this came out . It was after the malaise of covid. When those 80s keyboards sounded out, I cried a little.
