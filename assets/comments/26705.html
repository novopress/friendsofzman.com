        Managerialism suffers from a lack of charismatic leaders. Quick who among the managerial class inspires loyalty and devotion? Tim Cook of Apple? Mark Zuckerberg? Jacinda Ardern? Justin Trudeau? Macron?Charisma and leadership matter. Particularly in times of hardship and crisis where bloodless, remove, “respek mah authoritah!” shoutings from the equivalent of South Park’s Cartman do not move people to sacrifice. Anyone can be in the Captain’s Chair in a warship in peacetime under calm seas. Almost no one can be there during wartime with shells raining down on the ship. Over and over again, when bloodless managers of one type or another emerge, they are undone by a crisis where they cannot act quickly nor can they mobilize and inspire large groups of people.“This western-front business couldn’t be done again, not for a long time. The young men think they could do it but they couldn’t. They could fight the first Marne again but not this. This took religion and years of plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that existed between the classes. The Russians and Italians weren’t any good on this front. You had to have a whole-souled sentimental equipment going back further than you could remember. You had to remember Christmas, and postcards of the Crown Prince and his fiancée, and little cafés in Valence and beer gardens in Unter den Linden and weddings at the mairie, and going to the Derby, and your grandfather’s whiskers.” –F Scott Fitzgerald, Tender is the Night.

            Managerialism uses control of information to exercise control over people.   It’s similar to the Catholic Church in that regard.  And like the Catholic Church it has very few charismatic leaders.

        “This shift from practical issues to abstract issues coincides with a growing incompetence and inefficiency in the system. This is where you see a comparison between both fascism and communism. Both of those systems started with great efficiency and energy, but that quickly dissipated. Fascism, of course, was smashed in the war, but …”But indeed. Once again people talking about “fascism” as if Franco and Salazar never existed, or disappeared after Pearl Harbor. Both led peaceful, prosperous nations for decades, until each died in the 70s. Spain, at least (fuzzy on Portugal) even had a peaceful transition to constitutional monarchy, if you insist on fascism being a temporary emergency fix. And Germany was doing pretty well — excellently, in fact — until that war came along (funny how that just happened). So yeah, “fascism” might have some useful ideas to share.

            Portugal’s exit from Salazar’s rule was bloodless as a military coup was staged during the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation_Revolution
IIRC, Portuguese forces engaged in a fairly successful struggle with Marxist guerillas in the future Mozambique. It was less well known than the struggles in Rhodesia and Angola, but there is at least one worthwhile article floating around.

                Salazar had passed away by the time of the Carnation Revolution, the only revolution to which I was an eye-witness. It was impressive! I lived in Spain at the tail end of Franco´s regime, but was visiting Portugal when the revolution took place. Those countries were relatively poor, but wonderful places in many ways. Today? I emigrated from Spain 18 years ago, well before what’s happened since.

        “Managerialism is a self-licking ice cream cone.”
I’m dating myself here, but this brought to mind a wise owl licking a tootsie roll pop 3 times to determine how many licks it took before he impatiently bit into it.
How many licks does western civilization take before it finally collapses? We wait with bated breath

        I would say Managerialism is both an absolute triumph, and likely absolute failure. State systems face the same constraints throughout time: organizing and deploying manpower against available resources: agricultural, weapons, military, commodities, etc. and maintaining internal stability among both elites and the lower classes while fending off foreign attempts at conquest and subjugation. This does not change because people have Iphones and Nikes around the Globe.Managerialism is a triumph so far as it has united elites nearly universally in the West, along hate hate hate for Dirt People Whites and worship of magical black people as sacred holy redeemers for the original sin of paleness and the industrial revolution. Which in turn allowed Dirt People to get all uppity. Consider cities, they have been turned under Managerialism from engines of commerce and money-making into gigantic money pits. Crime and violence drives away corporations and the middle class. The homeless attract vast sums of federal, state and local money. Each homeless person in LA generates AT LEAST $250,000 a year and more like half a million. That’s enormous amounts of graft for the political/managerial class to grift from, no good government oversight by the fled middle class that worked at Big Corp, and vote factories from the native criminal class (black) for the dominant political party. This system has thrived during the Cold War and after with no serious challenge to its supremacy.HOWEVER, with primarily China competing for scarce fossil fuel and agricultural resources, and most manufacturing sent to China or other Asian nations, this is likely no longer the case (no serious outside challenge). The primacy of the Elite Managerial class is breaking down all over the West with Freedom being made “racist” = uppity guaranteeing a revolt as big shots flout rules openly and enforce them on Dirt People. The Middle and Working classes no longer trust or like: government, media, corporations, the military, police, medical professionals (who ration care based on race, Whites back of the line), etc. Various rolling revolts are likely a permanent feature of Western society. Can Managers who inspire little/no loyalty lead Western society to ever declining living standards while fending off Chinese and other external challenges? My answer is no.

            Agreed. Putting aside the MIC’s obvious greed and self-serving manipulations, much of the frenzied motivation to put down “rogue” foreign governments is the Managerial State’s inability to simultaneously concentrate on domestic oppression. The recent humiliations in Afghanistan and Russia (yes, that was a total humiliation for The Sick Man of the West) have the upside to slowing and perhaps stopping the Managerial State’s strangulation of the heritage people within its borders.
They cannot do both, so let’s hope they keep trying.

            The homeless are able to “generate” $250k a year because the managers control the money printer and actually buy into MMT.
The real world effect is to simply accelerate the devaluation of the USD, which is one of the main techno-commie goals on the way to the installation of a global, carbon-controlled currency that can be used to manage each AI-nudged meatbot on highly granular, individualized basis.

        “Instead, managerialism needs to be viewed as one manifestation of something that also produced fascism and communism.”This “something” is called popularization of “higher” education. The left has always been the party of the “educated”. The working classes were an alibi to get power (today the alibi is the coalition of the fringes).More people go to universities. This means that midwits go to universities, where they don’t belong. As a result, the requirements to get a degree get lower and lower.You end up with a mass of credentialed midwits who they think they are very intelligent, because they repeat the ideas of the dominant class. They think they are too good to have a blue collar job (which is where they belong, because useful white collar jobs are few and apt for better people than them).The number of white collar jobs increases to include all these people, who are completely useless so these jobs must do nothing useful: such as paperwork or demanding “inclusive” language. You have to tax blue collar jobs and print dollars to finance these useless jobs.This is the root of managerialism: an overproduction of [candidates to] elites, as Peter Turchin has studied. This overproduction precedes the collapse of a society.The left is only a machine to produce jobs and give more influence for this kind of people. “Consultant of climate change”? That sounds good, baby.

        Here’s an example of rule by experts in 1885.  This example is an duplicate of Canada today, where the police are shaking citizen’s hands as they sing the national anthem.
Smallpox wasn’t cured by vaccinations demanded by the medical industry and mandated by government:

So, modern representation becomes a question of who gets to command first, and who can tell them to stop.

            I came across that same smallpox article yesterday.  Perhaps the truth about smallpox isn’t as presented in this article, but it’s almost certain that the established narrative is also little more than Swiss cheese.

                What I’d like in these type articles are *citations* for the historical data presented.  The story is nice, but without such pointing to original source, the whole essay is one large “gratuitous” assumption.Those blog’s I most like to read are those by knowledge people who are willing to identify themselves and cite their references.  There are no shortage of doctors/scientists who cite published studies which support their critiques—and the best of the best simply explain and analyze such studies for the layman.Anonymous writings are not necessary and I find them suspicious.  Certainly, I can never refer other to these sources.  But that’s just me and my bias from a lifetime at university.

            I’ll be going back to Ottawa soon (assuming the thugs don’t end up shooting all the protestors before the weekend). I’ll let you guys know how it is.
Going to protests is one of the few recreational activities I can take part in as part of the unvaxxed underclass. Turns out that removing the bread and circuses leaves a whole lot of angry people with nothing to lose. Many of the people protesting say they will keep coming because they literally have nothing else to do.

        Capital is the ownership claim on an income stream, risk adjusted and present value discounted. The trend we are within is that ownership and control are being centralized.  The corner market replaced by the Walmart and especially the Amazon.  The local bank replaced by a branch of Goldman Isaac.   Giga Wealth funds Blackrock, Vanguard, and oligarchs are drivers, government rides shotgun.  Ever fewer oligarchs control ever more of the economy. Owner operators are squashed out; the middle class denuded.They don’t want you to have any means to evade the rules they impose.If the oligarchs didn’t want smash and grabs to occur, they would be stopped. They would manage government “deciders.”   They would use their media to dole out goodboy badboy attention-units. They would dispatch their Bribery Blackmail teams.  Rebellion from oligarch authority will be dwelt with.Smash and grabs, along with covids, along with riots, serve to dismantle small business to consolidate power into their few hands.Managerialism reflects separation of ownership and operation.  Owners hire the managers to oversee operations. It permits fewer owners to control more operations.It seems that the dream being sold is that a group of wise and benevolent owners will own everything. A sort of trust fund that will create a global happy meal.

            Definitely trying to close the loop so we are not exactly in a free open marketplace but something like Disneyland where everything is owned by the same people and we are essentially locked inside the park.  Yes, free to roam around, but you’re still inside the fences like cattle.You see that a lot in suburban places where everything is pretty much a franchise with few mom and popsOne thing nice about Los Angeles, among its many downsides, is that it is dense and populated enough where mom and pops can thrive and survive and fill in the gaps left by big business.  Although there are a few franchise restaurants I like ok, such as Texas Roadhouse, it is nice that in large cities you get lots of local mom and pops and more creativity.  The suburbs and smaller cities definitely have their upsides, but having great commercial variety isn’t one of them.

                Falcone:  I think there needs to be a distinction between the historic concept of the American “mom and pop” stores, and today’s ethnic markets.  The Amish farm produce stand or the small town general store I will happily engage with and purchase from; the illegal Mestizo market or reeking Chinatown shop not so much.. . . Even the large, gleaming supermarkets in Singapore had that same distinctive smell – not as strong or quite as unpleasant, but still very noticeable to my Western olfactory glands.

                    You make a good point, wrt ethnic markets and restaurants.  Yes, they probably do comprise the majority of local mom and pops, but then you have Melrose Avenue or La Brea or La Cienega or even Sunset and Ventura where there are thousands of local shops and stores catering to “whites” for lack of a better term. Restaurants, home furnishing, clothing, etc.  And downtown we have the Fashion District where any aspiring clothing designer can choose from thousands of imported garments to craft whatever they want.  That business is booming btw.  And not all the garments are from China or perhaps Korea but also from Italy or Spain etc.  Also we have a ton of small local businesses up by me that are producing tons of creative content for the internet that gets beamed out to every white kid in the world.There is just A LOT going on in a big city, even one where whites are a clear minority, that operates outside of big business.  When I drove to Florida last month, I will use Amarillo as an example.  Now I liked Amarillo, the vibe was pleasant and the people friendly.  But at least where I was it was franchises for miles packed to the gills with locals and travelers.  Restaurants, clothing, furniture, all big name franchises.  With only a few local restaurants and the like intermixed.  Not to mention that Wal Mart or Target were the biggest things in town.  Out here, we have two Wal Marts within driving distance of my house, a new one in Burbank and one “barrio” and older one in Panorama City.  We have many other options for the things they sell so that they aren’t that crucial to the local scene.  I don’t see this in the Tampa area or Ocala, didn’t see it traveling through Texas, but maybe in Miami it is more like L.A.I get your point that the first thing that may come to mind is the ethnic restaurant or market, but there is a lot more than that.  In fact we have Italian, Cuban, Peruvian, Spanish, German, Russian markets within a few miles of my home.  Then you have Armenian, Persian, etc on top of it.  So not all of it is 3rd worlders stuff but good high quality European and South American stuff.  The Italian and German markets have some of the best cold cuts and breads and pastas one can imagine — all from the old country.  Now I contrast that to the major grocers where everything is pretty much Boar’s Head — yuck.

                    That’s just being tribal which is the best thing to do.
Philosophically they are still “mom and pop” stores which is good same as roof Korans  but as they aren’t my people I avoid shopping from them.

                The only sensible goal for a partisan is to have total control.They are small in number in comparison to us and they don’t have complete control. Yet. So as they string the perimeter wire they have to keep up illusions.One can map physical territory and metaphorical territory back and worth.  There are many similarities one can find with the Palestinians.Notice how they pali terriories are being cut up.  Once surrounded, the peculiar people cut up the territories into smaller and smaller chunks that were isolated.  And cut off so they can more easily subjugate and eliminate each chunk separately.Their media paints the pali as terrorists, extremists, etc.  Same as they do to all their enemies from Canaanite  to Canadian to everybody in between.—When faced with invaders, Alfred the Great, unified and fortified England.  He built roads between towns and fortified towns.  That way town A could hold off long enough for folks from Town B to show up and help.

        To come at it in yet another way, those who rise to the top and make the decisions that affect the masses are rarely the best and the brightest. The chemistry of interpersonal relations and the ever changing context of the times are imponderables that often make the difference.Example: consider an office pool in which everyone tosses ten bucks into the basket along with a prediction, say a week long time window,:of when will it be okay to say “all life matters” again? Or “when will the mask/vax obsession end?” It’s a crapshoot. Today is yesterday’s unanticipated consequence. We can analyze how incompetence and corruption overtake an elite and then place our bets on the composition and likely direction of the coming elite.It’s a jejune analogy but Tom Brady, now considered the GOAT, was a sixth round draft pick frim whom the Pats didn’t expect much. The five QB’s who were drafted ahead of him? A recent documentary’s been made about them.So, like the dark eyes of the lady whom, in the sombre night, the Russian balalaikist awaits, “we watch and wait, by the postern gate, full of heaviness, full of care…”

        In Canada the managerial state is now moving in to teach those uppity redneck truckers their true helot place. Vile threats, unlawful under civilized jurisprudence, to steal people’s money, livelihoods not to mention self-respect, are being issued left and right by Globohomo’s local commandants. Of course, this total control is the result for all eventually, if the wicked weirdos win.
If Free Canada folds under the strains, it will be endless tyranny or a sea of blood. They want our complete freedoms handed over and nothing less will do. What do we say?

            The truckers showed how fragile the managerial state is, and how dependent they are on financial attacks and moral browbeating.  Both the financial attacks and browbeating they are outsourcing to third parties, they the government is too incompetent to do both, as one can see by Trudeau throwing out the racist word like a man making a magical incantation.
At some point, even the pozzed private actors are going to look around and ask themselves why they should take orders from these clowns.

                I agree Trudeau seems somewhat desperate. This is probably also why they’re overreacting by invoking the emergency powers act. They’re sweating, it would be a tragedy to fold now. Of course easier to say than do. But we’re all descending into totalitarian imprisonment.

Notice Harper, Trudeau, Singh, Scheer all heads of the different parties.  Then NGOs, charities, Blackrock etc. The list goes on.
I wonder if the fact all the party heads are part of the same org has ever been mentioned in the main press in any detail?
I can answer my own question.
Vote harder.

                        I wonder if Canada, and Australia and Austria, have been serving as test beds for how far you can push the helots. They are smaller (not small) countries than what would probably be the main targets of WEF plans, the US in North America and Germany (and France) in Europe. And culturally and linguistically, conspicously close the two ‘fat cows’ (US and Ger).But I’m also assuming WEF is busy infiltrating Germany, America and all other Western countries. Buttigieg is one example. These people are anything but innocent and realize it. Which will probably make their responses wilder in the near future.

I believe that is exactly what SPECTRE….I mean the WEF is doing with the countries you mentioned. Shocking the rats in the cage, as Chris Martenson put it the other day.
I bet that if we sat down and went through the WEF site we could put together lists similar to trumpton’s for each of the countries you mentioned.

                    Agreed. In addition to the systemic weakness, the trucker protests have revealed how stupid Globohomo has become. In the not-too-distant past–pre-Covid, pre-2020 riots, really–the propaganda organs could have whipped the Canadian public into a frenzy in opposition to the truckers. There has been some of that but it has been relatively minor.
I really doubt it is Peak Globohomo, but it might be closer than we think.

                        What “leader” pisses on the guys who bring food to the city?
On the one hand, Trudeau KNOWS that he needs these guys, knows that they have to work as a team, but still knowing that can’t let his snobbery not get the better of him.  He HAS to show that he is in a higher social class.  Like they don’t already know that?  Like they even give a shit?  A complete child.

                        If they are in fact on the ropes, we should brace for desperate measures from them. Assuming a moral lobotomy, would you give up control of the West’s riches without a fight? We should brace for brace for financial, professional, media and, especially if those fail, possibly violent persecution from them now.

                I’m a little surprised the Deep State hasn’t rolled out their BLM and Antifa auxiliaries yet.
I think they could potentially get away with that because most normies continue to exist under the delusion that mid-2020 was an organic protest movement, rather than a deeply cynical, organized, and paid for insurrection that was part of a larger Deep State coup.
Then again, maybe more people are awake than I realize.

                    As to BLM/Antifa riots, I do think people have come to realize they are state-sponsored terrorism. If they happen again, there will be at least one and perhaps many mass casualty counter-attacks. Globohomo isn’t ready for that, at least yet.

        I thought “white supremacy,” was the answer to the question, “Who will the new enemy be?” It runs into the problem of there not being enough (or hardly any) white supremacists, and that they’re not a military threat besides. You can make money with contracts for spying hardware, and drones, but you can’t trick someone with an IQ north of Hank “Guam’s Gonna Capsize” Johnson that you need aircraft carriers to take out a David Duke. Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, and General Dynamics can’t pretend they need new missile-guidance systems to take out Bill who’s got a RAHOWA newsletter he prints on a mimeo machine in his basement while wearing an old Sturmmbahnführer cap.But the educational complex, NGOS, etc. find their main reason to exist in antiwhite hatred. It’s codified in schools now, which I think is one of the red flags (along with iconoclasm) that genocide is imminent. I remember in “Europa, Europa” how the teacher demonstrated for the kids how the Jew skulks. That’s basically what Robin DeAngelo and all of these “Dear White People,” things are doing, mocking and dehumanizing preparatory to something else. I imagine it takes a lot of concrete and barbed wire to build a camp, so at least general contractors will get work. Most of them are white, but people have been forced to dig their own graves before. Just tell people you’re building new sportsball stadium. What red-blooded American would go against that?

            Yep, Whitey is going to be the next big, bad bogeyman – and you don’t even have to be a “White supremacist” – skin color will do just fine.  See J6 folks or Canadian truckers for prime, early examples.  Hopefully, we’re getting close to a serious inflection point.  Maybe the American trucker convoy will be the straw the breaks the camel’s back.Oh, and the soft on crime schtick only applies to jogger crime.  I can guarantee if I walk out of the hardware store w/o paying for my three dollar can of spray paint, the full force of the law will undoubtedly crash down on my head.  But hey, I’m White, so it’s all good.

                usNthem:  After weeks of Daily Mail headlines about the massive shoplifting going on in LA in NY by all the usual suspects, the other day they finally featured and headlined yet another example now accompanied by close-up photos.  A White woman of course.  And while civnat conservatard websites focus on all those imaginary black, brown, and yellow patriotic Canadian truckers, Trudeau specifies the real problem is rayciss notsee Whites.  Oh, and they’ve found/planted some scary black guns on some of them, too.It’s all of a piece.  I was thinking about the cops in Canada going around and carefully photographing and taking note of all the names and license plates, and now people’s insurance is being cancelled and their bank accounts seized.  And then I mused about the cyber takedown of GiveSendGo, and Canada declaring non-approved crowdfunding akin to terrorist money laundering.  Add to this the pervasive cameras everywhere – Walmart is using facial recognition cameras on every aisle as well as every self-checkout.  And it purportedly monitors a shopper’s emotional response to a product.Of course, avoid all the anti-White stores like Target and try to avoid the worst of the Chinese-made stuff from Walmart or Dollar Tree, and avoid the masses of diversity and masks at malls, and one is left with online shopping – again awash with various personal identifiers.  I know I’ve been on every possible government list for years, so perhaps it’s just personal paranoia that I sense the net tightening.  I still expect, before the end of the next few years, to be denied permission to shop (unvaxxed, wrong facial expressions, ‘terrorist’ donations, etc.).Meanwhile my husband’s now-retired high school friend still expects to live off his government pension for the next 20 years, and my son’s in-laws went off on a cruise.  And I, well, I frequent Z blog and the gym and homesteading videos.  I may have emotionally seceded from the system, but I remain physically trapped within it amidst all the see-no-evil GoodWhites and diverse asylees.

It seems to me that TPTB realized that the dark side of consumer convenience is complete control, and they are running with it.
The best you can do with online shopping is attempting to buy directly from the manufacturer. That can be interesting because their shipping departments are not nearly as optimized as Amazon or UPS.
The only thing to do with those who are still asleep is assume you are already living in a zombie movie. Some may awake on their own in time. Till then it’s best to leave them alone.

        A couple of generations  ago there was a concept calledHigh Modernismthat described both later stage capitalism and communism (at least the soviet variety).  It centered around the idea that science and technology with government direction could build utopia, perfect societies and end poverty, hunger and every other negative aspect of life.It fell out of favor in the 70s, being repudiated by diverse movements including environmentalism, nimbyism, hippies etc.But it never really went away, instead the focus was shifted from mega engineering projects to digital technology and using that as the means to re-engineering society and humanity.IMO it’s all an outgrowth of the enlightenments tabula rasa and replacement of god with man.    Those beliefs set us on a path that led inexorably to the point we are at today.   The only real difference between the capitalism and communism is the speed with which dystopia is achieved.

            To be honest, sometimes the most simple, childlike responses are pretty much bang on target.
For a long while now, and markedly more so through the Shamdemic, our governments have been howling, over-exaggerating, back-biting and blaming like the most sex-starved, over-credentialed shrew ever to walk the Earth.

            Here is some hilarious obviously paid for content on Putin and Ukraine in NATO from National Review.  Some engineer named Robert Zubrin brings up Hitler, but of course he isn’t comparing Putin to Hitler.  Even their own comments are ripping into him.  I wonder if they put it in the NR Plus section in hopes fewer people will read it.

        I think the problem is actually worse than described in this post.Yes, the systemic rot of managerialism is a big problem that will eventually force a collapse, but an even bigger problem is that there is no effective civil remedy. Politicians are just actors whose only function is to perpetuate the charade that voting matters. And a majority of voters are either on the government dole as parasites or have no skin in the game and can be easily bribed for a pittance. So the viscous cycle spins faster as we circle the toilet bowl.And the only non-civil feedback mechanism is the Jackboot cadre owned by the Cloud Rulers. And their purpose is to crack heads or worse in defense of the Citadel. And as long as Joe Normie’s credit card still works at Starbucks when he buys his daily latte, he will remain on the couch watching sports ball.Nothing will change until the environment changes. Without a quick collapse, we are doomed to a slow motion death spiral that likely ends with a lot of bodies in trenches.

Ezzackly.  “The vote” is ALL they know and talk about, as if voting is some kind of magic that builds water treatment sites and improves reading scores.
It’s like listening to E! Entertainment Tonight or reading Sports Illustrated.  All they know is their narrow industry.

                These politicians are addicted to the voteWithout they start getting the Jones and antsyI think in their hearts and minds, seeing those vote tallies roll in on election night is similar to what I felt when I would hit the jackpot in old Vegas and my plastic cup would keep  filling up with quarters.  Then I had to keep playing to get that feeling back.Add in the fact that, like with actors, they crave public approval.  The applause completes them, fills that hole in their heart.  I think we have a hard time relating to it because what completes us is a good steak and a loving dog and a wife nearby in the kitchen but not too nearby.  You need your space.

        Out of my depth, but I’ll take a stab at it. In the middle ages, the state had near-absolute power in theory, but a limited ability to project that power. Religion was the old media— transmitting values and culture. The combination of distance and the church as a moral force checked state power.Technology changed that. The printing press enlightened the people. Democracy, liberalism, laissez-faire, etc., rose concurrently. Meanwhile, the war machine became democratized and deadlier. All of this lifted up private interests to the point where they were on par with the state. The force-multiplying effects of technology were never addressed. Somewhere along the way, God died.Technology is the unconquerable demon, it seems. So far, anyhow. Without it, the Enlightenment couldn’t have been as revolutionary, the last century couldn’t have been as bloody, this century couldn’t be as insane. Soul, body, and mind destroyed in turn. It’s been dehumanizing.Don’t know if that’s on target, or off base, but that’s what comes to mind this morning.

            I think you are spot on. This is why I joke when people talk about 2nd amendment based revolts. Okay – you got an AK… good for you. If you revolted, the gub would blast you from 30000 feet with a drone (hey – those videogames are good for training drone pilots) and then the media would call you a white supremist (the ole’ Lavoy Finicum, if memory serves). You would be forgotten by the time your bloody mist settled on the grass.Technology’s infiltration of our mind, and the ability to monitor that data, has created an unprecedented moment in time – both in the imbalance of power and the invasiveness of that technology. The medieval peasant’s mind was free most of the hours of the day – he was only proselytized for an hour on his day off. When is your average American’s mind free?Of course, the ultimate struggle in TPTB right now is how to manage that data. Hence, the push for AI to sift through the incalculable and indecipherable amount of data being gathered. Right now, they are good at pulling records. What terrifies me is when they are good at sifting at a near present moment rate.Happy thoughts!

        Hmm, I’ll take a stab…The state exists to both serve and exploit the population under its power. Different forms of rule (fascism, communism, managerialism) have various methods of doing this and take on balances of who gets taken from and who gets given to. Fascism is probably more preferable because it acknowledges the reality that the rich are powerful and capital is important for industry, but it also maintains kinship among the people and protects workers. A harmony is hopefully struck between the elite and the masses and those running the state get to enjoy a secure position of power (with killer aesthetics) over a stable society.Communism sucks because it denies the natural order in so many ways. Instead of power and wealth going to people who are able to use capital productively, the state acts as the Giant parasite and sucks off the capital for itself while trickling off some of the loot to the Little parasites. Neither parasite is productive so the society becomes poor. The state pretends to punish capital and reward workers but all it does is enrich itself.Managerialism is much closer to communism than fascism. Under the guise of expertise the state (and state like entities) siphon off capital and influence in order to use for itself. The managers are rewarded with wealth and prestige and some capitalists do very well but only because they’re connected to the right managers who create artificial conditions, e.g. Elon Musk. Everything becomes inefficient and most everyone becomes poorer and less free. Like communism everything is done behind an ideological veneer but the powerful act exclusively in self-interest.I haven’t studied enough about fascism but clearly it’s the winner here. I suspect it failed only because the managerial/communist (Anglo-Judeo) world order crushed it with sheer force.What all of these systems have in common is they are godless, in that it’s all throne and no altar. Without a pervasive religious notion there is nothing to check self-interest. Ideology is always fake. Fascism/NS at least had the volkish / zeitgeist-thing going for it and it wasn’t explicitly anti Christian and atheist the other two were. And fascism is motivated by popular interest in fighting off the all-destroying forces of communism and managerialism, giving it a vitalism that can ultimately claim victory.

            Fascism WAS religious at least in the academic side of it, the intellectuals expounding on it, etc.   if you read the fascist theorists you will see as much.    fascism, at least in Italy and also probably in Germany among the southern Catholic areas, was something like the last gasp of traditionalists in the Catholic Church to fight off communism and keep God alive and in society.  Meanwhile acknowledging that life had changed in terms of industry etc.  it was a way to marry the old and new.  More importantly, or perhaps crucially, it had to have a charismatic  leader on top holding all the “sticks” together, the sticks being the various institutions such as commerce, church, academia, etc. in that way I suppose it was something of a heresy because what it really did was subordinate the pope to the head of state.  But I’m sure there were various theorists and so forth who were able to justify this to calm the nerves of many a Catholic.Ok, so maybe fascism was not explicitly religious, but it was not godless and it did make room for religion and had a seat at the table available to the heads of organized religion.  Religious people were part of the team. Communism was entirely godless, as we all know.   Managerialism ?   Hard to say but it seems more godless than not.   Funny enough but the amount of godlessness in any of them tracks with the percentage of juice in senior positions.  Shocking.

            In order to assume fascism would work any better you would have to demonstrate some sort of self-correction mechanism in that system that would prevent the same elite parasitism issue present in communism or managerialism.  After Hitler pissed away an entire army in Stalingrad he blamed the soldiers for not fighting hard enough, and by the end of the war his attitude was that the German people had failed him.  It really doesn’t sound any different from our current elites who think of us as disposable cattle and useless eaters.

        One feature all of them share (managerialism, communism, and fascism) is that they have to provide jobs to family members of important people and/or favored classes such as blacks.  This can always only snowball as time crawls along, at least for a few generations.Another thing they all share is that their initial impetus was in rebuilding and/or expansion.  I remember many Americans always putting down France or Italy for example for being socialists, but what they never understood was that this was a rebuilding effort.  These places were devastated in a war so the promise was made, you help us rebuild everything, you do your part, and we promise we will take care of you in any way we can.  There was a team camaraderie aspect to it lost on Americans.   But now that the effort is compete and everyone getting older, the original purpose and energy is no longer there.Similarly our managerialism was a response to a massive expansion in the labor force either through blacks getting involved or later women and later yet millions of immigrants.  In addition to westward population growth. It served a purpose and helped guide through those changing times but now really has no purpose as things are beginning to settle into a steady state and the “frontier is dead”So at, least two things seem to be in play here.  The cruder and crass reality of having a mechanism and means to help out your political supporters, which all of these -isms provide, and yet even bigger yet is you need some massive undertaking that gets everyone revved up and involved.   So if managerialism is to survive, it will need a massive new project to busy itself with.   And what might that be?

        Some have deemed the marriage of fascism and modern managerialism “expertocracy,” but the most appropriate term for it is TECHNOCRACY. It will be totalist. “Into the pods you go! You will eat ze bugs!” All that jazz. Imagination may prove the only limit on the humiliations to which the technocrats will subject their fellow humans. Should be fun.

            The technocracy is clearly on display in the 60 pages of Xirl Science writing masquerading as my engineering college’s alumni mag.
I am continually struck by the limited range of research topics.
It’s the AI singularity, self-driving EVs (now including bulk cargo carriers!), the renewable energy hoax, and transhumanism, all the way down.

                Women in science always stuck me as ridiculousThey couldn’t even stand to see the sight of a cricket getting its leg torn off as children but they were going to become great scientists?   Going to take nature head on without fear?  Probe the intricacies of nature with no preconceived notions of what to expect?   Like sailing into the unknown?  Yeah, surePlus women have far less natural curiosity and minds that tend toward the pedestrian, so it’s perfectly in keeping that the range of topics they put forward is going to strike men as stale garbage.They really need to get back in the kitchen.  The charade has gone on long enough.  And the men and children are hungry.

        “For example, the bum problem that has plagued every city in America since the 1980’s was not deliberate.”
It may not have been deliberate at the start, but the refusal to do something about the problem for the last 40 years has been deliberate. We have a problem with vagrants for the same reason there is a problem with illegal immigration: some powerful people have decided that’s how they want things to be.

                “One Flew…” was great read for its time.  We were all young then and full of psychedelic “vigor”.  😉 I can remember reading this novel in a single night—too gripped by it to put it down.  Of course, I wanted Kirk Douglas to play the lead role in the movie (so did his son, Michael).
But I grew up.  Many I see about me did not.

        I thought this commentator had an interesting take on the fusion of communism and fascism in China:
https://mobile.twitter.com/Ne_pas_couvrir/status/1493443488893050880
The points about how fascism was used to solve the production issues almost sound like they wrote the old joke about what Chairman Mao would be told by the Party if he rose from the dead today.

        The managerial elite of the Fistagon like Milley exist to fight (but not win, as victory used to be defined) interminable, low risk, low casualty “interventions”, “conflicts”, “insurgencies”, “separatists”, “extremists” or “terrorists”, not actual wars, with aircraft and high technology in Third World backwaters.
How that would work against Russia is something the political managerial elite will never consider until they get a real war with Ivan to teach them a hard lesson.

            As Russian forces withdraw from the borders of Ukraine, and Biden (or whoever writes his stuff) proclaims “victory”, remember Sun Tzu: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting”.
I imagine the actions of the Ukrainians (and the Poles, and especially the Germans) will be more congenial to Putin than they were before the show of force on Ukraine’s borders.
Russia has learned, and we have not, that demonstrations of force do not require the deaths of thousands of young men. Good for them.
Let Biden claim victory. Moscow knows who won, and so does Berlin.

                Looks like I correctly predicted that the Russians wouldn’t move yet. Why would they when they have three more years of misrule by Old Joe and his merry band of ass clowns to flush American power down the toilet and make the job easier?You think the mighty AINO military will be in any better shape to take on Ivan in his back yard three years from now? Vladimir Putin asked himself that question too.

                    Even though the United States will claim to have stood strong, Russia thus far has experienced a smashing success without firing a shot. NATO is more fractured than ever, the United States looks like a fool and liar (shocker) among certain allies, and the Ukraine knows it probably needs to negotiate because it has been used as a pawn and would be again. A decent guess is France and Germany cut a deal with Putin and the eastern Ukraine will achieve some sort of Northern Ireland quasi-autonomous status after a decent interval, Ukranian NATO membership will never get mentioned again (it never would have happened in the first place due to the unanimous consent requirement), and intermediate-range missiles will be removed from the Empire’s easternmost outposts.Winners: Russia, Germany, France.Losers: United States, the United Kingdom.Draw: the Ukraine (almost a win since it avoided a bloodbath)Both Russia and China realize they can wait the United States out at this point, but the fly in the ointment is the USA is batshit crazy. Another fly in the ointment, to be fair, is that the Duma appears to want outright annexation of the Donbas (I had assumed it would happen but Putin appears opposed). Also, it is notable the Biden junta refuses to acknowledge the Russians have backed away from the Ukranian border. Geez, seems they wanted the confrontation.It sounds insane but there is a direct correlation between the open border, Covid fascism, Brexit, the 2020 election theft, 1/6, and the truckers strike, and what just happened in the Ukraine. The Regime could not whip up the “go ‘Murica” fervor with the rubes to the normal extent because it has lost legitimacy among much of the usually pliable and gullible cannon fodder. Hope the Covid fascism and alien invasions were worth it, motherf******.Of course, the Regime may well become more vicious and oppressive, but we should see the green shots, as Z frequently writes, when they appear.

        One of the key features of complex societies is that most of the foundational work—across all disciplines—has been done by the giants on whose shoulders we stand.  Moreover, that foundation was laid at nominal cost.  Edison’s filament was basically the result of a handful of men.  With 80% of the innovations and discoveries accomplished, that 20% comes at a staggering cost, and more and more specialization.  Hence the rise of the managerial ‘elite.’  Yet, with the proliferation and insane funding of the technocrats, the needle barely moved, and, in fact, complexity is shown to be a rabbit’s hole with no end in sight.  At some point, the foundation cannot support the mushrooming, metastasizing superstructure.  It will by necessity, collapse.  The insane truly are running loose and the asylum.“Ol’ Charley stole the handle, and the train it won’t stop running no way to slow down.”

        Sorry but the only solution is to abandon cities. It is no coincidence that modern problem arose as people abandoned the countryside in significant numbers. And this movement predates the industrial revolution as we see with the Levelers of the English Civil War.
All these movements, communism, fascism, managerialism, have arisen in response to that initial burning of social capital.

            I’m not sure fascism could have survived the death of its leaders and probably would have gone down the same path to managerialism.  From what I can tell, fascism and managerialism had similar goals of using the organizational and political power of the state to solve large scale problems plaguing the then modern society.

                It is hard to imagine Hitler surviving at the top of the system without the war. I’m not even sure Nazism would last without war. Latin fascism was much more coherent and practical. Nazism lacked a governing principle, beyond the cult of personality around Hitler.

                    As has often been commented upon, had Mussolini stayed neutral, or better yet double-crossed Hitler and joined the Allies, he would have died in bed, a respected elder statesman. Whether Fascism would have lasted as a system after his death  is much more questionable. Franco, probably the most competent of all the fascist between-wars leaders, couldn’t get it to last in Spain.

                        When looking for a system to produce a series of “enlightened” despots, I tend to look at the CCP.  True, they are an experiment in progress, and their demographics are way better than ours, but they have after Mao and “Mrs Mao” produced several despots in a row that have propelled the country to the top of the world economic ladder in two generations.  Not sure however that making Xi eligible to lead for life was a good move.

                        Salazar and Franco were the longest-serving European leaders of the modern era, if memory serves, including the dictators of communist countries in Russia and the East Bloc and most if not all of the monarchs. Franco got it “to last” about 40 years and Salazar even more.

                        On the flipside of the China coin, would any of those Chinese leaders of the past 40 or 50 years have done nearly as well if they had not had the benefit of the entire West showering them with cash and prizes on a scale that rivaled the US’ post-WW2 economic boom?

                    Z-Man, how can you know about Hitler/Nazis when you yourself if exposed to the mainstream would be called a Nazi?  They call everbody to the right of Stalin a Nazi!  Even baby-faced Rittenhouse!And if you say you’re not a nazi, then that begs the questions:  were the Nazis really “nazis” in the sense of being the cartoonish metaphysically evil gassers of all that is good and innocent?I myself don’t know, I wasn’t there.  But I realize all we have to go on is what the media/schools have told us about history.  And if we look at how the media reports history we ourselves saw and the PRESENT that we see with our own eyes; then we know that the media is the Lord of Lies.So how can we trust what they say about the past at all if we can’t trust what they say about what’s in front of our own eyes?For all we know, Hitler was the “good guy” trying to liberate the nations from the antecedents of Soros and all that is diversity globo-homo!Thought experiment:  if defeated by globo-homo, what kind of man would be depicted for all eternity as the embodiment of total evil?

                        Your point is an excellent one. This is one of the great questions when trying to learn from history. I generally lean towards believing that most death camps were probably cruel labor camps that turned into starvation prisons as the war escalated. I do not doubt that much cruelty was done there, and the possibility of a coordinated killing, but if you actually look at the passages that justify a view of the Nazi’s as engaging in genocide, they never use full passages. The ‘academics’ will quote a line, insert several sentences of commentary to bridge to another quoted line. Nowhere is overt planning of a systematic destruction ever quoted directly, to my knowledge.It seems to me there was great antipathy towards many minority groups, and the idea of isolating them as partisans opposed to the regime is quite likely, and mass murder is undoubtedly employed at times and places. As a true, country wide, “Final Solution,” ehhh….Even the Red Cross denied mass executions back in the day.But, as your point illustrates, how can we evaluate the reality of the circumstances in the age of lies? Good point. I think it is fair to first argue that they must have been desperate people after the Weimar Republic and WWI – I mean, twenty years of misery will make a populace desperate. No doubt this led to a desperate people looking for desperate solutions.However, what is often left out of the mainstream reports is just how involved foreign (meaning US, British) industrial magnates investing and exploiting Germany due to their vulnerable status. These people control the media, and how many know that Ford sued the US government for bombing the plants making engines in Germany, or Ma Bell built the phones. I think it is a lot murkier than made out, and the involvement and complicity of various factions bury the truth.I support this with a final reference to Smedley Butler. If you know about the coup planned, and the big names involved, you start to question the official narrative. I either believe one of the greatest soldiers in American history or the US media. See fakeemail’s point to arrive at my conclusion.

                        Eloi- Germans are always the victims when people like you “describe” history. How unfortunate for them that they somehow attract corpses around their military formations or documents in their thousands appear filled with plans of starving to death millions of Ukrainians , Poles and Russians.What a pathetic people they must be to always be on the receiving end of these injustices. Notice how primary evidence that shows German complicity is “taken out of context” but vague assurances of British interference are confidently made without presentation ofany evidence. I’ll grant you that American business was a key aid to the Nazis eg General Motors was responsible for one third of all repairs to German armored fighting vehicles throughout the war. I’d mention IBM and their role in the death camps but you don’t believe the camps existed.

            Isn’t the abandonment of cities exactly what we have seen during the past two years of Beer Flu restrictions and the Floydian insurrection?
This is in direct contravention of the stated globalist goal to cram us into Smart Cities so we can sleep in the pod, eat bugs, and have our waste water watched for Beer Flu particles by the Smart Sewers.
People voted with their feet to resoundingly reject this part of the globalist plan.

        One aspect of managerialism is the insane level of utopianism involved.  Any sane society knows there are tradeoffs, and no problem can be completely solved on a society-wide scale.  Nature never operated like a sterile corporate workspace, and always finds a workaround to at least partially foil the best thought out plan.  This is what we saw with the zero-covid hysteria, inequity in criminality, mental illness, etc.A sane society knows that there’s collateral damage, where people end up in seedy areas in a state of near anarchy, and they accepted it as long as it did not seep into working class neighborhoods.  They somewhat tolerated bums as long as they didn’t harass people in the retail sector.  There would be services and charities to try and help, but with the implicit understanding that some were simply a lost cause.Now petty crime is everywhere, and people get harassed by street crazies as a matter of daily life, all because they don’t like the racial demographics of criminality or institutionalizing people who need to be institutionalized.  any attempt to crack down so normal people can live normal lives is now followed by bellowing about human rights or racism.

            You touch on something that does not get nearly enough attention. That is the gap between the actual competence of these elites and their perceptions of themselves and their fellow elites. The managerial elite is increasingly incompetnant, while increasingly confident in themselves. I’ve been following Jake Sullivan, Biden’s National Security Advisor. He is a great example of this phenomenon. He is brimming with confidence in himself and his fellow “experts” despite no knowing much about anything that would be useful in his job.

I don’t know how they do it. If someone tried appointing me to that job, I’d be like “why? What the hell do I know about infrastructure?  Can’t you hire someone who at least has some experience as a civil engineer?” The guy studied  history and literature at university.   I would feel like such an ass.

This group dwells in sort of a bubble, we are at a level where we “know” what we “don’t know”, and of course hesitate to attempt more than we are capable of accomplishing.  A “know thy self” phenomenon.
The real world is full of Leftist hacks.  Call them ideologues, Dutton midwits, Dunning-Kruger examples, whatever.  It’s pretty much the same.

                Respectfully, I would counter that this phenomenon is well-documented (Dunning-Kruger etc.) and frequently discussed at your typical management retreat in the private sector.
I think the difference is that there is no “feedback loop” in the public sector (since elections change nothing). That is, there are no consequences for failure (look at all these incompetent Generals and politicians). People in the public sector “fail upwards”.
Private businesses that fail to examine and refine their decision-making processes generally go bankrupt. The Government, in contrast, marches on…….

Zero chance.Example.   It would be impossible for a smart man and highly competent and accomplished military person to be in the same room as Lloyd Austin and not want to tell him to his face that he needs to shut up because he’s just a dumb nogger and token hire and if he doesn’t accept his role then it’s time to go out back and settle it for good.  But of course that can never happen.  You have to pretend they’re your equal.Think about that.  How can anyone survive this total lie day in and day out?

                        I suspect a minority of the types who survive the idiocy are highly intelligent sociopaths. Sullivan may be a sociopath but he’s a rare stupid one and that doesn’t count.

                        One other option: ZFG.  I suspect there are a lot of fairly smart guys who simply don’t give a shit if it pays well enough.
May be depressing and frustrating, but that’s what the money is for.

                Incompetence is an easy answer, but it does not explain why the effects of this alleged incompetence go only one way. Not even the flawed perception they have that they are competent explains it. At some point, I think you have to go back to some form of evil, at least as defined by the desire to dominate others.Could you someday go over why it matters that managerialism was a response to political “shortcomings” while fascism was a response to communism? I’ve gone over Gottfried’s works dozens of times and have never understood the distinction either of you are making there.I guess specifically why the distinction between using regulations to proscribe any industrial outcome other than the desired one, and the threat of confiscation of the capital equipment for failure to produce what the state demands. For example, in America, they used regulations like CAFE and wokeness to force electric cars on the populace, while Hitler would have just said, “Make electric cars or off to the camps with you.” Having been on the receiving end of the regulatory state, it seems a distinction without a difference.

                    Others have brought it up, but the system still relies heavily on volutnary cooperation.  Perhaps that is why the approaches are different.  And perhaps tactics will change as the voluntary compliance diminishes (cf. Canada).

            Yes, their incompetence is astounding.  I wouldn’t even have that much of a problem with them if they were ruthlessly efficient (like the good ol’ fascists of yesteryear were supposed to be).
But after waiting for two hours for a local ‘Bureaucracy’ to fix something petty, and having been told rudely that ‘It wasn’t THEIR job to fix it’, and going back out into the street where feces, garbage and homeless abound, one is struck by how utterly incompetent and worthless they are, and how completely their cosmopolitan utopia has failed.

                Zorro:  Their cosmopolitan utopia was designed to fail, in the sense that any traditional values (truth, beauty, morality) were deliberately shut out as relics of White patriarchy.  The American elite all live in sterile NY apartments or LA mansions, and shun traditional architecture (consider the beauty of some of the Victorian civic buildings) as rayciss.  The ugliness and filth and chaos are part and parcel of not merely their incompetence but also their distorted perception of reality and, at the heart of it, their hatred for historic White Western civilization and who and what built it.. . . For the past 3-5 months there has been a group of Romanian gypsies begging on the street corners all over various northern suburbs of DFW.  Same people, usually with their children, and I’ve seen them at half a dozen different locations miles apart.  A decade ago I got a local Walmart to call the cops on a lone female gypsy beggar outside their door.  Today, I wouldn’t be fool enough to call – the cops would be far more interested in documenting the dangerous White woman reporting these downtrodden brown people.  And because the gypsies wouldn’t have been there if the local politicians and cops didn’t want them to be.  It’s all by design.  Welcome to the physical manifestation of rat utopia.

                    Good comment, particularly your point about the architecture. The Soviets and other communist nations sometimes deliberately (and, yes, unintentionally) used bland and sterile architecture to make an ideological point, which I suspect you know, about equalitarianism or whatever.
The NYC and Hollywood “elite” are such conformist airheads, though, that it is likely their ugly “anti-racist” architecture and general zeitgeist are motivated more by peer pressure than any actual belief. The ideologues of old sometimes actually believed their BS.

            The utopianism means that there isn’t just a belief that every problem has a solution, but that every problem has a *perfect* solution. I got a masters degree in a humanities field about 18 years ago – my employer paid for it – after getting an engineering bachelors, and what struck me was the near complete inability of the other students to appreciate the basic concept of trade-offs. This mindset, coupled with a complete lack of understanding of anything technical, also coupled with their profound sense of self-importance, led to some mind-boggling stupid ideas, such as the guy who seriously suggested we power houses with stationary bicycles hooked up to batteries. (He had no idea about the difference between AC and DC electricity, much less electrical power). And if people didn’t like these ideas? The default solution was always, always, always government regulation to compel compliance.

                Absolutely.  General population lack of knowledge and critical reasoning will be our demise.  It pervades our current society top down.Look at all the Elon Musk groupies.  Musk muses (over a joint?) about our need to colonize Mars in the next decade or so and his minions sing his praises loudly and sign up for the first “ticket”.No where does anyone ask about how one survives such a lengthy trip in the cosmic ray hazard of space, or even Mars.  How we economically push such huge payloads required out of earth’s gravity.  The fuel/engine requirements of such a ship.  What self-sustaining enclosed human habitat has been tested on earth—say in Antarctica—which has a milder environment than Mars.No.  Musk said we must/can do it and In Musk we trust…the rest is just detail.

                    A necessary first step prior to trying Mars colonization would be to seal ten people in a small aluminum box underground for years and see how long it takes to turn out like in Event Horizon.
