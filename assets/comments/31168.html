        Argentine hereI didn’t vote for Milei, and I didn’t vote for Massa eitherI am just ultra jaded about democracy and too bitter for almost everything at this point (And I get more jaded the more anti-human things get).I sneer at the retards who voted for Milei out of hopium, and I have no illusions about anything.This is all I have to say.Cheers

        “… the voters in democracies have repeatedly picked the genuine clowns. Trump, Bolsonaro, Meloni and now Milei have come to power this way.”
I hope Zelenski does not read this. Seems the poor bugger is feeling pretty neglected as it is.

        I stopped trying to understand Argentine economy and culture decades ago. Just like trying to understand Israel and the Arabs/Muslims and the “road to peace”.Argentina went from being a outstanding first-world nation to a basket case. How? I could never understand. Then someone, maybe it was Ed Dutton, pointed out they were slowly flooded with lower IQ people. Makes sense. A crisis of competence.Explains the childish voters who swing from one extreme candidate to another. Each one is their new Messiah. Every election the same pics of cheering ecstatic  idiots.I will be long cold in the grave and the Israelis will still be bombing Arabs, and the Argies will still be enjoying economic crises and elected new saviours.

If a “leader” were to emerge – that is the charismatic, strong-willed person who becomes overwhelmingly popular, would he (she – not likely) come from a background of:

            “Whether the black of the negro resides in the reticular membrane between the skin and scarf-skin, or in the scarf-skin itself; whether it proceeds from the colour of the blood, the colour of the bile, or from that of some other secretion, the difference is fixed in nature, and is as real as if its seat and cause were better known to us. And is this difference of no importance? Is it not the foundation of a greater or less share of beauty in the two races? Are not the fine mixtures of red and white, the expressions of every passion by greater or less suffusions of colour in the one, preferable to that eternal monotony, which reigns in the countenances, that immoveable veil of black which covers all the emotions of the other race? Add to these, flowing hair, a more elegant symmetry of form, their own judgment in favour of the whites, declared by their preference of them, as uniformly as is the preference of the Oranootan for the black women over those of his own species. The circumstance of superior beauty, is thought worthy attention in the propagation of our horses, dogs, and other domestic animals; why not in that of man?”-Thomas Jefferson, “Notes on the State of Virginia,” Query XIV

        for Friday show –
how much of the political divide in the united states is real and how much of it is superficial? In my mind it seems less like Northern Ireland or Yugoslavia and more like internet fandoms juxtaposed into real life.

        Here is ‘news’ of yet another “NEW” political great hope.  A Turkish Kurd pretending to be Dutch whom the BBC labels “tough” on immigration and supposedly willing to work with  Geert Wilders (a supposed anti-immigrant populist who’s a zionist).  Another election, another country, another phony.  But people keep falling for the latest product, because he/she/it will finally change things.
I don’t care what label anyone supposedly carries – populist, anti-immigrant, libertarian, etc.  Until I see unabashed pro-White separatist advocacy, I’m not buying what they’re selling.  And I’m continually amazed by how many – here and elsewhere – do.

        Agreed Javier got elected on theatre.But he won (by a lot), and the other guy didn’t.
And more professionally, he’s an economist who doesn’t like government meddling in business, and says flat out that woke is poison.

        At this point I am fully convinced that the elites install guys like Milei just to provide some temporary distraction and to get some cynical people back to voting. The one thing they want from us – the only thing, maybe – is to vote, because it is their way of  manufacturing consent. Nothing ever changes though. Look at Italy, people voted for that woman to cut back on immigration and she’s opened the floodgates. In Britain, after Brexit, immigration is higher than ever with no signs of slowing down, except it’s coming from the global south instead of Eastern Europe. Look at what voting for Trump got us, not in the vote for Trump himself but the response by the system – a total collapse in the rule of law, show trials, mass censorship, brutal anarcho-tyranny, institutionalized second-class citizen for Whites, open borders, global war for Israel, etc. All things that, of course, the elites want and have been pushing for. It really comes down to the one thing the dissidents say, including on this blog, you can’t fix the system by participating in the system.

            Mycale:   ” . . . you can’t fix the system by participating in the system.”Preach.  It doesn’t matter if you put ‘parents’ on the school board or economic reformers in charge of the budget.  It’s all theater.  They’re all liars.  The system co-opts everyone.  The problem is democracy and voting itself, all based on the assumptions of equality and representation.  Aliens oughtn’t be represented.  Nor stronk women with face tackle.  Nor the sexually degenerate.Stop rearranging the pieces.  Either risk it all by tipping over the board, or personally secede from the filth that is modern ‘society’ and work on your own resilience.  Time’s a wasting.

        Here’s something for the mailbag:So lately the left outside of the Democrat establishment has been pretty vehemently anti-Israel over the Gaza invasion.  This seems like an opportunity to for us to actually accomplish something for a change, namely diminishing Jewish power by taking away their control over the lefty golem.  Most people only want to go along with the ideology that will get them laid at a house party, and our problem has always been existing as the designated bad guys so getting at least something we want pushed by the left would be a win.I guess the way to do that would be to push as many sob stories about butchered Palestinian children as possible to activate the repressed mothering instinct in leftist women and get them on the warpath against Israel and by extension the bagel-Americans who keep howling for blood.  Imagine if the only hold the Jews had left over the culture was establishment Republicans…just a bunch of liver-spotted ugly old neocons bleating about our greatest ally.  The Jewish identity would become profoundly uncool and lefty Jews themselves would rapidly move to drop the identity similar to self-hating white liberals.Is this just a pipe dream or potentially a viable win?  The obvious problems are the left wanting to resettle the Palestinians here (which will probably happen anyways), and the “we can’t sink to their level of using emotional rhetoric” objection.

            Every people have their myths and legends, Jews among them. The issue is that a politically powerful group of them believe it as fact. Given the vicious self entitlement in their myths, this is bad.What is calamitous is that they demand that the rest of the world go along with their bullshit.Every word they utter is a lie  (remember that?) they are the people of the lie : the Bronze Age Death cult was founded by Jacob, the Father of Israel, who as we know, was a liar, a thief, a fraud.How else do you explain the Kole Nidre?That’s the recitation at the commencement of their their most sacred ritual, which makes it right with their god, not for the lies and oath-breaking of the past year but gets the OK for the ones they’ll tell next year.Here’s a bit from the Wikki.“The formula proactively annuls any personal or religious oaths or prohibitions which are made between oneself and God in the course of the next year, so as to preemptively avoid the sin of breaking vows which are made to God but are not or cannot be upheld. ”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kol_Nidre

        Mailbag: Previous generations of racially aware, ethnically sensitive White Americans ignored the duty of maintaining their dominance and instead prioritized everything from Prohibition to landing on the Moon. If a core dissident belief is that people more or less “are what they are”, can we hope for different behavior from White Americans in the future?

            Excellent question.  It reminds me of when I asked a friend who knows his Spengler really well, if being conscious of the life cycle of a civilization can allow the civilization to avoid its death.  He smiled grimly.  “Spengler says no.”If there is a solution, it seems to me it must involve:•  whites being persecuted enough that they come to see each other as necessary brothers against the other racial tribes who will probably never see beyond race•  some kind of religious awakeningor some combination of the two.Finally, I would add that previous racially aware white generations were convinced that setting up a race-blind government was worth a try.  My hope is that we learn from their failure.

            It’s certainly true that whites have been a crusading race at least as far back as the crusades. Were they one before that? It’s hard to get the sense that they were. It seems to be connected more with christianity than with anything about the biological nature of whites.

                Depends on how you define “crusade”. The Vikings went on many little “crusades”, if you want to think of piracy that way. And why not? Battle was their religion. And come to think of it, a lot of the crusaders were landless second sons, restless and hungry. The Holy Land beckoned and they carved out kingdoms.
If you think of any kind of expansion into space, whether that space is empty or sparsely occupied or crowded, as a crusade, then yes, we are the crusaders par excellence.

                    I think there’s a clear distinction between crusading and plundering, even if some of the latter went on in what are called The Crusades. Crusading, whether to “liberate” the “holy land,” to free slaves, or to prohibit alcohol, or to make the world safe for sexual degenerates, is imbued with some sense (however true or false) of a higher purpose. Plundering has no such aspirations or illusions.

                    “…aot of the crusaders were landless second sons, restless and hungry. The Holy Land beckoned and they carved out kingdoms.”
A lot of them were kings in their own right, actually, and many of them beggared themselves crusading in Outremer.

        Question: What type of cats do you have? I remember you posting that you have something called jungle cats, or some equivalent, but what are they? I know you have the old one with two new ones, but I have been curious about what they are, as the term seems to be a generic one. How big/ heavy are they? Just my curiosity of visualizing when listening.
Bonus question: On your podcasts, particularly the Sunday ones, you, once or twice a show, have a low frequency boom. Is that you hitting the mic by accident?

        Not voting your way out was cemented at least as far back as FDR. Maybe folks could have voted their way out with Huey Long, had he lived, but after that it was too late. Or maybe his death is evidence that it was already too late. The Permanent State was firmly in place. From that point, national politics became a contest not between who could control it, but between who it would tolerate. As Mark Knopfler sang, “The Man’s too big, The Man’s too strong.”It’s really been an incredible run, when you think about it, that it took about a whole century for any sizeable number of people to start noticing.

            Speaking of Huey – just viewed an old movie (circa 1950) All The Presidents Men.  Loosely based on his life, and interesting to note the Hollywood take on politics then (as well as parallels to now).

        “Clown,” like “comedian” and many other public roles, are forms of acting.  Politician might well be consider as acting.    Trump, Milei, and others are well received by members of the constituency which chooses, and this is what we can see when we aren’t distracted by grease paint.The Jewish Telegraph Agency  gushes over him:Milei’s passionate love of Judaism and Israel has been one of the several unexpected qualities that Argentines and political analysts have become accustomed to during his rapid rise over the past year.He demonstrates his passion for Judaism at rallies and public events, often walking out on stage to the sound of a shofar, the ram’s horn blown on Rosh Hashanah. At one rally in August, the shofar sound was accompanied on a screen by a photo of a man wearing a Jewish prayer shawl.He is also an outspoken supporter of Israel, having stated before the start of Israel’s war on Oct. 7 that he would like to make an early diplomatic trip to Jerusalem and to move Argentina’s embassy to that city. In one of his final public appearances before the election, Milei was seen waving an Israeli flag among a large crowd in Rosario.… study with Rabbi Shimon Axel Wahnish, who heads ACILBA, an Argentine-Moroccan Jewish community based in Buenos Aires. Milei said he has considered converting to Judaism but worries about how Shabbat observance would clash with the duties of the presidency.Argentina’s shocking primary winner could become the country’s first Jewish president

            Many theories abound on this phenomenon.I’m of the Occam’s Razor camp on it. The simplest explanation is the most likely. He is aware who the controllers of the world are. May as well bend the knee publicly particularly if you are an eccentric outsider if you want to even get on the dance card. Doubly so, if you want to win.I’ve also heard it is part of his minstrel act, not to be taken too seriously. It is 1488D chess and he is actually a master gaslighter who will position himself with the tribe only to later pull them completely out of all levers of power.The list goes on and on but as I said, the simplest explanation generally is the right one. He wants to convert their entire economy into Jewbucks, so this one isn’t all that puzzling, right?

        To the Z man and all other commentators: drop this autistic stuff. Autism is a disease. Milei is anything but from what I have seen. He is gregarious and engaging (anti-autistic if anything). His problem is that his libertarian philosophy is a pipe dream and his program could only be pushed through in a dictatorship. Liberal democracy is unreformable. Let us hope it is not also indestructible.

                The first diagnoses of autism were in the 1940s by a child psychologist named Kanner (it was once known as Kanner’s autism). He was the pre-eminent American child psychologist of the time and recognized autism as a new phenomenon. The attempt to associate prominent figures of the past with autism is part of a psy-op to minimize the severity of autism and to obscure the meteoric rise in diagnoses in the last thirty years or so. Along with this is the attempt to characterize autism as a genetic condition, as though genes could explain a greater than hundredfold incidence in autism. It is clearly (as Dr. Robert Naviaux of UCSD terms it), an ecogenetic disease, with the genetically vulnerable subjected to an environmental insult. Those providing the insult (Big Pharma) control the government/medical/scientific response to the autism explosion and do everything in their power to hide the cause: the explosion of vaccines given to vulnerable children.

                Correct. Dr.Robert Naviaux at UCSD believes the condition is caused by the cell danger response, induced by a toxic insult to the brain. The CDR prevents proper cell communication.He is cagey about exactly what that insult is  but cites the administration of multiple vaccines at once as a risk factor (administration of multiple vaccines at once is a routine practice).Read all about it:http://naviauxlab.ucsd.edu/science-item/autism-research/

        “People like Grillo and now Meloni offer some hope for a purpose.”
A completely fake and gay false hope.  Vox Day made a post just yesterday with the following quote:
“Italy’s Meloni is now pushing for more immigration after running her election campaign on stopping immigration.”
The Argentine clown has proclaimed his love for Israel and open borders.
Under all the clown makeup lies a bunch of demonic satanists who are just as hell bent on destroying nations as their “mainstream” counterparts.

            It’s because no one who is actually based is going to want to go into politics.  Imagine having to work around all those slimy compulsive liar sex perverts all day long.  And the greasy little shits trying to climb the ladder working for you, remember those dorks in college that did their little United Nations D&amp;D?

        Let’s not forget Zelenskyy, who was an actual, professional clown but is now being upheld as a paragon of democracy. Yet he is very much a frontman for The System, which indicates that the wire-pullers know damn well they can bamboozle the rubes with a clown when it suits their interests. Plato understood 2,500 years ago that the hoi polloi would always support the guy who could put on the best show in the Assembly.When you get right down to it, we have had a fair number of professional clowns in our politics who were endorsed by the Establishment — Reagan, Al Franken, Schwarzenegger, Sonny Bono. It’s a feature of democracy, not a bug. The Establishment only freaks out when they get a rogue clown who goes off script, like Trump.

            The main reason why Ukrainians voted for Zelensky (besides the heavy advertising campaign on TV), was that he promised to end the war in Donbas and to come to some sort of an agreement with Russia. Once in power, he did the opposite and it appears that everybody forgot his promises.

        Thoughts for Friday–in a perfect world, no one could stand for public office until/unless they could demonstrate they had successfully run a business (without major government assistance) for at least 5 years. This would eliminate much of the “straight from college to politics” teatsuckers. And age limitations would be another biggie, everyone out at age 62. Also, after 8 years of any kind of public service, whether elected OR appointed, they could not remain in public service ever again so it would behoove them to act quickly on issues so as to leave a “lasting legacy”. Then the only 30 year drones would be the ladies at the state licensing bureaus. This might eliminate the old boys network as there would be a slow turnover. School boards could only be comprised of parents with school age children.

            In a white society where women couldn’t vote, something like that would probably work pretty well. Until some opportunistic office holders decided to change it. Standing for public office at all is part of the problem.

                Yes, it’s tempting and fun to try to construct the perfect constitution that will anticipate all future problems and solve them before they arise.  Our founders made an excellent attempt.  But ultimately, the success of a nation comes down to the people.
It’s like that old jab at gold bugs, “If you believe that the financial system is so corrupt that only a gold standard can fix it, then that very corruption will make reform impossible.”

        “They currently have inflation at 120%, a swelling debt crisis and a stagnant economy.”There have been periods when inflation has been in the thousands of percent and even in the ten thousands of percent. The debit crisis is another mainstay of the Argentinian economy, as well as a faltering economy.If you look at the history, things were hunky-dory until 1914. Argentina was and has been an exporter of agricultural and meat products. Until 1914 it was an advanced society, with a per capital income twice that of Italy and Spain. And hence it attracted migrants from these countries. After WW1 the pattern of trade shifted, with North America benefiting and Argentina suffering. The interwar years were ones of stagnation. After WW2 and the ascent of Juan Peron is when the fun really began. In other words massive deficit financing with the concomitant consequences of debt crises and staggeringly high rates of inflation.During the ’90s, in the Carlos Menem era, there was some price stability because the peso was pegged at parity with the US dollar. But this was unsustainable and a new crisis emerged in 2000. By way of anecdote there was one old lady — known to an acquaintance of mine — who had 200,000 USD in the bank. The bank then converted her USD to pesos without her consent at the official rate of 1-to-1. The black market rate was already 3-to-1. A few days later the authorities changed the exchange rate to the black market rate of 3-to-1. In other words the old lady got swindled out of $133,000 by the bank. So no-one trusts the banks and everyone keeps their hard currency in the mattress.When I was in Argentina in 2005 and 2006, the rate was still three pesos to one dollar. Today it’s 352 to a dollar. This gives an idea of the inflation rate during the last 18 years.I don’t think Argentina’s problems have any solution. It depends on agriculture, beef, and some light manufacturing and assembly work. The workforce is largely lumpenproles working in the “informal economy” (i.e., off the books). Though the same can be said of every Latin American country. There’s a lesson in it for the USA: good times don’t last forever.

            I think our fundamental problems are cultural not economic. And Argentina seems like a busted flush of a country. Major food producers, reasonably high IQ/western population, amble land, not exactly crowded. This should have been a success story. Instead it’s the macro version of a bum that used to be successful. Cultural idiocy must be why they went down the drain.
But one small economic idea, which is not original; except when in a declared state of war, no deficit spending, period. Culture and fiscal discipline are related, both on macro and micro levels

If you are an Argentinian, you know that there’s tremendous pressure for deficit financing. The trade unions are powerful and vociferous in their demands. Other sectors of society are also vociferous. Street protests are common. You probably remember 2000, when five presidents changed in four weeks — because of street demos.
My knowledge of Argentinian history is not so great — maybe when the generals were in power in the ’70s and early ’80s, with their reign of terror, there was not much protesting?

                “I think our fundamental problems are cultural not economic.”
Would you elaborate on why you feel this way?  I don’t disagree that we have massive cultural problems that are probably more important to us than the economic problems. However, the way I see it, the US has massive economic problems that are probably at least partially responsible for the cultural problems.
Our main exports are variations of clown masks in the form of music, movies and software along with machinery. We’re running trillion Dollar (945B)yearly trade deficits.

                    What I mean is, the culture produces the politics. Culture today promotes greed, legal loophole gaming, short-term gratification. In short total frivolity. This is strikingly reminiscent of Rome, golden age Arabia, ancient China, ancient India, before they nosedived and we’re overrun by foreigners.
Frivolity produces nihilism and cynicism. The main purpose of a culture is to produce meaning. We must get back to a culture that can deliver that. That is far more important than being able to produce artillery shells and microchips again

                I’d agree. There are various studies that show that once a country’s debt to GDP exceeds 100%, things tend to go very badly. Certainly, once you get to 120% or higher.But I believe that the economists had it backward. It’s not the debt that destroys the society; it’s the society that got the debt to 100% or above that destroys society.Sure, having debt to GDP above 100% is going to cause problems for a society, but something is wrong with your leaders and society in general that gets the debt above 100% in the first place – outside of a foreign invasion that cause debt to soar to deal with the war.The US dealt with its WWII debt is a way that didn’t blow things up. (Granted, you could argue that we shouldn’t have been in WWII and that this was a sign of our decline.)High debt to GDP is a sign that there’s something wrong with your society. The debt issues with almost every developed country and China are a sign that we are heading off the rails. At least China has some excuse as it was trying to modernize, but the West has no excuse.High debt to GDP during a time of relative peace (or what should have been peaceful) is absolutely a sign that you have no plan and are decaying.

            Argentina’s problems arise from Argentina’s incorrigibly childlike people (mostly European and papist). Since the people with diarrheamouth won’t let theirselves be corrected, the solution is obvious. The children of Europe must be crushed throughout Argentina, and their precious Jew must be driven into the sea—or put down on the land with his inferiors. In fact, why don’t we just admit that this is much of the solution needed for ALL of América, from the Arctic to Isla Hornos? 531 years of Abrahamic cryptosecularism and Western despotism is 531 too many. That dirty, rotten stuff needs to go.

            What should also be mentioned is that Argentina toward the end of the 19th century instituted a “population replacement program” through immigration the like of which we so decry here today.  Except at that time it was from European nations.  The strongman at the time had little use for a primarily Indio population.It worked and made Argentina *the* standout country of South America.  The USA is now going to be proof that such replacement can be good—or bad—depending on the quality of the immigrants encouraged.  We will demonstrate the reverse of the Argentinean “experiment”—how a primarily European population can be destroyed via an influx of non-European “browns”.

                The problem is they got their immigrant working class populations from Naples + Italian points further South as well as Spanish Galicia — i.e. the human dregs of Western Europe. Peoples who were despised in their own countries of origin.
Argentina was always pretty White — not polite to ask what happened to the original inhabitants roaming the Pampas. Apparently now there is massive illegal immigration of Browns from neighbouring counties — encouraged by the Argie Left because never hurts to have more client voters.
Either way, poor human stock –&gt; poor outcomes.

        I still think that Europe is going to be the leading indicator of what comes next after the collapse. One of their weaker economies will fall first and start a domino effect that results in serious and widespread social unrest. And we will be able to learn a lot based on how things evolve there when it happens. But South America could beat them to the punch and Argentina is a likely candidate to get the ball rolling if that pans out. Triple digit inflation leads to endless social stress which eventually must be released. Massive street protests are the safest means of relief, but rioting and wanton destruction of property is a close second in terms of probability. But neither of those solve the root problem.Its best think of a nation (large agglomeration of people under one identifiable government) via the human body analogy. The body has been infected by pathogens which are few number but have lethal potential. Society grows progressively sicker as the pathogens do their dirty work in the shadowy nooks and crannies of the organs that make everything work. The sooner the antibodies recognize the threat (and respond), the greater the likelihood that remedy will win out over death.Antibodies do not vote for a solution to the pathogen problem because that does not work. That reality has existed for existed for about a billion years now.

        What is interesting is how we have allowed our soi-disant elites to define the important concepts of our society; two examples:
1. Democracy, rule by the people, has been reduced to the ritual of voting whereas it should be a system of distributed decision making.
2. A long the same lines, free market capitalism has come to mean markets controlled by a few, favoured, actors, whereas it ought to mean lots of buyers and sellers together with the ruthless suppression of monopoly

        The European blogger Kynosarges has a similar argument in 2019 where he castigated the short-sightedness of right wing populism, which he believes has six major deficiencies:1. Right-wing populists have no awareness of the depth of the [societal] problem and the necessity of a massive social transformation.2. Right-wing populists consider metapolitics irrelevant. They view our plight as strictly a matter of state policy, therefore solvable by the legislative and executive branches (which is understandable given point 1).3. Right-wing populists do not command parliamentary majorities or sole governments – neither in the past nor in the present, nor likely in the future. They are always in opposition or dependent on coalition partners who are not right-wing populists.4. The institutional corset of late liberalism narrows the factual scope for political action to such a degree that profound changes are impossible.5. Right-wing populists offer no grand designs for solutions because they lack a positive alternative framework beyond “liberalism without foreigners” (which is closely linked to points 1 and 2).6. Right-wing populists are objectively too slow even where they bring about changes. A critical comparison between the development of right-wing populism and demographics during recent decades clearly shows that this approach is impossible solely due to lack of time (ignoring points 1–5)…Because of these issues, according to Kynosarges, “[Right wing populists] have no concept of how to actively solve the problems of late modernity or liberalism. They offer no counter-culture that goes beyond reactionary ideas. They become almost apolitical when they merely retreat into their nation-state bunkers (typical for Poland or Slovakia). They lack a dynamic counter-ideal, and they are not at all equipped to propagate such an ideal to the furthest corners of the West (and beyond), as the chief enemy is (still) capable of doing.  The equation of our identity with the liberal state (e.g. the Federal Republic of Germany as the land of the Germans) inevitably leads to disappointments and at best to the realization that this state neither defends nor recognizes our identity, sometimes even destroys it. No Western constitution has a decidedly identitarian foundation, nor is there any trend in that direction. Anyway such a foundation would be incompatible with the self-concept of liberalism (universalism, egalitarianism, individualism) – the left is correct on that point! But right-wing populists believe that liberalism would only need a “right-wing” orientation to solve the problem, thanks to insufficient analysis….  Modernity can only be overcome with the experiences of modernity, not by an utterly impossible return to an earlier or pre-modern era. The profound change that is now necessary is not genuinely political but belongs to the cultural, metapolitical sphere. Such a counter-enlightenment or counter-culture requires – in contrast to the liberalist eclecticism of right-wing populists – a spiritual preparation for a new European myth that binds us to our oldest past and reconciles us with our future. Nothing less than such an attempt at European rebirth is our task and the most promising exit from political modernity.”From:https://news.kynosarges.org/full-speed-into-the-void/

In LineInTheSand’s Republic, the constitution would be short and the most important sentences would be:  the highest goal of this government is to promote the flourishing of the white people within its lands.  No law can be made, or government action taken, which contradicts this highest goal.

        Did the people of El Salvador vote themselves out of the problems of liberal democracy?  Bukele seems to be correcting many of the problems that plagued that country.  He is wildly popular so he would probably be reelected even if his governing style is somewhat authoritarian.
Maybe we need to elect an authoritarian who wants to improve his country and not loot it?  Singapore and South Korea seemed to follow this path.
Just musing on my part as I do not know the intricacies of El Salvador’s politics.

                Singapore and South Korea are prototype globohomo societies, tests for what to do to the rest of us. Singapore is a refinement of Brazil, of (you could call it) libertarian apartheid, with a small free consumer class and a repressed servant mass that barely touch, roughly on the “fifteen minute” model that England is implementing. South Korea is super-America, operating on no principle but anti-masculinity, with everything that’s not female or gay being “phased out” (especially reproduction). It’s easy to mistake them for high-function/high-trust societies because they’re full of well-behaved East Asians. What they’re doing is dying politely.

        For the mailbag: “You cannot reform an illegitimate system by participating in it.” – quoting myself here.  Discuss.Are these clown candidates actually the voters demonstrating that they are increasingly aware not only that the current system is broken, but that it is fundamentally illegitimate?  So they send candidates who are illegitimate in the eyes of the ruling class to the Capitol to create chaos.Trump’s policies were stymied, but his real purpose (I think you called him “the mule” years ago) was to disrupt the system and illustrate the core illegitimacy of our current system.  Within 6 months of his election, Republicans in the House and Senate were actively participating in an administrative coup d’etat to overthrow him, and they were working to defeat Trump’s core agenda items like immigration/wall and repealing Obamacare.  It took only 6 months (really less, once you consider the collapse of Conservative Inc. media) to prove to Normie that Republicans had been outright lying to us for 30 years.  That was the great value of Trump.  People call him a carnival barker, but the point of the carnival barker is to get your attention.Anyway, I believe that the only way to reform our current system to something that actually represents the people who live within it is to go outside the system and attack its structures.  Don’t vote for more Republicans.  Everyone should stay home and ensure the defeat of *every* Republican.  Just lay waste to the system.  We also do not use our greatest weapon to lasting effect: economic soft power.

            As I’m not the first to note, South Africa is a great argument against accelerationism. In the face of failure and collapse after 30 years of one party ANC rule, they are clinging to the rainbow as hard as ever.

                Agreed, and what comes next always may be worse, but wasn’t SA initially propped up by Britain and America and now by China/BRICS? Which is to say, accelerationism will not work if there is a backstop for the lunacy.

                Everything must be weighed against the alternative.  Acceleration no different.  Since collapse is inevitable for real change to occur, then the faster, the better.  That SA suffers to this day as its collapse is prolonged is not an argument against acceleration—not if you believe in inevitable collapse.  SA is simply an example of how long collapse can take in a first world Western country.  It is an interesting experiment in testing the limits of “Smart Fraction” theory in the meantime.

                It’s an interesting comparison given that we live in a country that, like the SA Apartheid government, is ruled by a minority population that lacks popular legitimacy.We have a strange inverse of SA.  Instead of being banished to tribal lands, the tribes are bussed INTO communities for the express purpose of breaking up those communities.  Various HUD programs moved blacks out of the inner cities and into white suburbs…driving whites to the exurbs as crime waves followed.  Blacks have not been spared as Latin Americans are dropped off in black neighborhoods where they are cratering whatever is left of social services there.All of this orchestrated by a minority government and ruling class that is utterly alien to the people over whom they rule.  And like SA, increasingly feels the need to use force to compel behavior.  They, of course, live in socially stratified communities with classes of people and political rank, preferential treatment for education, jobs, etc based race, etc.The big difference?  If our culture and ruling elite collapsed, the majority population that remains would not be millions of black Africans, but (presently) a majority or (future) plurality white population.  60-70% of this country is not an economic or social basket case.  Inner cities would pose problems, but those places are pretty much one cop shooting away from devolving into Mogadishu anyway.Would a collapse of the system send the USA into anarchy?  I don’t think so.  Besides, we don’t have to accelerate it into collapse.  We need to accelerate the removal of people from the ruling class who do not represent our interests.

            All good point. It also raises something for the mail bag:
Is the GAE ruling by brute force at this point? It certainly appears so with the indictment and trial of Trump and open disregard for the Rule of Law. Mao’s axiom that all power comes from the barrel of a gun seems to have been adopted openly but it would be nice to hear Z’s musings on it.

This sounds like a lot, but nobody likes journalists, politicians, and academics are highly suspect. This is just a Latin American soap opera being staged by and for the 60% who are smart enough to read and understandHarry Potterbut lack critical and lateral thinking skills. The reason why it happens is because 60% is a lot of people.

                Not until they throw him in jail.  Right now they’re warning each other against doing this, because they fear a wave of political assassinations.Our shared fragility is how exposed everyone is to their neighbors.  I think with COVID they found they couple shove people around a lot further than they realized.  But that only lasted about 10-12 months and then people started disobeying which is bad.  By the end, the FAA was literally the only government office sort of holding the whole power grab together via mask mandates.  They were able to hold people hostage for a total of about 18 months until a Federal judge saw what was coming and wisely saved them from themselves.

            As long as we’re posing questions for Z Man’s next podcast, I’ll offer one.“…proof that there is no voting your way out of the problems of liberal democracy.”Over the years, you’ve made a strong case against liberal democracy.  However, even though I am a fairly consistent reader and listener, I don’t have a sense of what systems that you may prefer as possible replacements.If I were to guess, I would say that you are waiting for the great white awakening, which we hope has more ontological substance than the great pumpkin, and then that after that, you would like a sort of paleoconservative, race-realist small government.This seems similar to the sense that I get from Derb.  If and when whites regain their cultural self-confidence, then we can be a small goverment mertantile republic.

        There may be no voting our way out of this, but the elections of people like Trump and Milei are a good sign. As Apex Predator was pointing out yesterday, the Milei’s victory isn’t really about Milei. It’s about the people being willing to break away from system and vote for an outsider.Sure, you could argue that he’s not really an outsider and maybe that’s true. But the point is that the people think that he’s an outsider. Same with Trump. It’s a sign of progress, a sign that the people are rejecting the system and, more importantly, the morality underpinning the system.Indeed, the fact that Melei, like Trump, won’t accomplish his agenda is another step in the process of the people realizing that the system is rigged. Think how many more people have been red pilled by the GOP thwarting Trump. Think how many of those people are now getting pretty damn pissed that Trump is being arrested and railroaded in the courts.It’s all part of the waking-up process. First, you vote for an “outsider” because the normal politicians no longer represent you. Second, the outsider either turns out to be fake or is stopped by the system. Now, you begin to realize that there really is a Deep State that controls things, that you never really had a choice, that the system has always hated you.Millions of people in the US (and soon in Argentina) are somewhere in stage two. And once you hit stage two, there’s no real going back. Now, what comes next is hard to say, but it either involves overturning the system or breaking away from the system as best you can.So, I applaud Melei even if he turns out to be a fake or if the system crushes him. He’s a sign that we’re moving in the right direction.

                It will require a revolution and a means of dispersing power away from the megacities. The Federal Reserve system must go away. A strictly limited franchise must be put in place: only white males of means and IQ should be allowed to vote. Can this be achieved nationally? NO. The country must be broken up into autonomous regions with the power of veto over any federal legislation they do not like. If the regional powers cannot regain a sense of ethnic identity, then they will sink into a cesspool of diversity from which it will be impossible to escape. May the best region win.

                        arthur bryant:  As dated as the Covington books are (no facial recognition cameras and smartphones and invasive tech everywhere), I still find myself referring back to them because they contain so many excellent ideas.
A clearly-defined White nation and government.  Prohibition and punishment of degeneracy.   No importing others to do requisite manual labor.  A sense of loyalty to society.  Lower level civic autonomy, with an overarching authoritarian state.
I would put more controls on women  (in politics and society in general) than Covington proposes, but the books are still an excellent starting point and blueprint.

        Question: Has any right-wing leader in the last 100 years accomplished anything without an Army behind him/her?
Maybe only Reagan (although he screwed up immigration bigtime) and Thatcher (ditto). Orban has slowed the descent of Hungary. I cannot think of anyone else. All the others were strongmen types (Franco, Pinochet, De Gaulle)
What do you all think?

            Through his vice-president, Milei has significant military support. I live (20 yrs) in the country, am bilingual and do lots of research. I participated in the campaign and have agreed to work with a committee designed to form coalitions with local, “county” and provincial parties, this from a guy who’s never much bothered with politics. I’m a long way from throwing in the towel on Milei, more so on the platform. I’m also a long way from being alone on this.

Never let reaganism die, eh?What Argentina needs is a coherent national identity, a homogeneous populace, and heavily controlled borders.  Then one can attempt to implement a culture of meritocracy and/or fiscal restraint.
The foundation of it all is human capital.  Without that understanding and basis, you end up with XINO and policy wonks.

Ask any Italian from points further North of Rome about Naples today and he’ll just mutter ‘Africa’… and he’s not even talking about the illegal immigrants :).Things were great in Argentina until they weren’t. They were a people who could only flourish and build during a resources boom (Other People invented refrigerated shipping for their beef or would never have been any boom time ). First hint of the cold winds of austerity and they fell apart. Compare and contrast with the more Teutonic bits of Southern Brazil. More Solid Folk who just keep on trucking and quietly prospering.Breeding will always out given enough time. Pretty sure you’d agree.

        My mailbag question:Dissident politics is more or less the project of reversing all the claims of The Enlightenment: men are not equal, democracy is a scam, women do not have a place in politics, hierarchies should be supported not destroyed, etc. Wouldn’t this extend to the idea of freedom of religion?Obviously, a society that refuses to establish a church will find its enemies establishing one for it. You only need to look at the American experience or, for the more historically inclined, have a look at the early years of Maryland.So, if a person who insists all races are equal cannot be /ourguy/, and a person who supports feminism cannot be /ourguy/, and a person who thinks democracy is the proper form of government is not /ourguy/, doesn’t it seem that we must also apply the friend/enemy distinction to those who support free exercise of religion?

            Yes, you’re exactly right.The idea of free religion (and its close corollary, free speech) are not traditional values and are in fact the fundamental wellspring of all the other Enlightenment problems you mentioned. You’ve pretty much put your finger on that part. A Church which claims to be the repository of a unique revelation concerning the salvation of mankind, but which doesn’tactlike it (by, say, taking the greatest care about doctrinal purity, insisting on the traditional rites, condemning heresy, and punishing heretics if they are obstinate) is no Church at all. People will pick up on that hypocrisy and cease to take the Church seriously, which is what has happened today.I think anyone who is genuinely interested in understanding the problems of the modern West will eventually come to the same conclusion about the establishment of religion. The problem going forward (which is a problem one can clearly see in the Z-Man and in many other Dissident Right personalities) is that they want to understand this process purelyfunctionally.The point, for them, is not whether the Church’s doctrines are true, but whether the Church is uncompromising and brutal enough to force everybody into compliance with the “moral code.” They recognize the social and psychological benefits of having a firm lawgiver, but they are much less precise about what the law should be.It doesn’t quite work that way. Simply having a firm Church will not be enough if the Church is not also the truth. The mind of man will seek for answers, and once you’ve raised it to the point of asking ultimate questions, it will seek for ultimate answers. A Church which is a mere intellectual tyranny may reign for a generation or two, but it will never withstand the questions of determined truth-seekers willing to risk all to see what is behind the veil.Thus, the establishment of religion is not simply a social phenomenon, it is an emblem of the fact that truth matters. It will force men to consider what is real and what is not. The consequences of such a thing are earth-shattering, which is why a reluctance to embrace religion is the last redoubt even among dissidents.

                    One point not mentioned is the government’s support of religion via the churches (tax exempt status, grants, parochial schools, etc.). The churches have been emboldened to step into the public sector and politics. Since there is no national religion, or church, we have a pretty messy unification problem.  But even if there were a national religion or church, what of it if others were still inclined to be more political organizations rather than spiritual.  UK has a national Church and they are little better off as I see it.One wonders what would happen if more churches took the “…render onto Caesar what is Caesar’s…” dictum to heart.

            Not only will there be very little freedom of religion, there will be very little free speech. Or, more to the point, Leftist speech will be forbidden and its authors punished severely. As we now know, Leftism is the death watch beetle in any society. It must be crushed before it has an opportunity to infest.

        If you deign to run for office, you are part of the problem. I don’t care how loveable you are with piercing blue eyes, like Milei. These people may be decent, but they are decently deranged. Even a small company (such as the one I work at) won’t abide an aggressive newbie full of piss and vinegar, much MUCH less a sovereign government controlling millions of people and billions of dollars.We need a Caesar…maybe not a military Caesar, but a Caesar of the boardroom. Someone who looks good, can sell ideas, get along with people, inspire confidence, which leads to factionalism which we sorely need in our uniparty era. I can see that kind of Caesar getting traction. The American Sun has a good article about that:https://theamericansun.substack.com/p/why-is-vivek-ramaswamy

            “We need a Caesar…maybe not a military Caesar…”
A Caesar without an army is no Caesar at all. You are imagining things that are impossible. Caesar could do what he did because he had eleven legions behind him.
We on our side must — absolutely must — come to understand that no man, no program, no platform, no clever idea, can possibly succeed without force.
The other side sees this clearly — as did Napoleon, Lenin, Sulla, Washington, Cromwell and all such men. Why can’t we? Have we really become too delicate to understand the demands of History?

This x1000. When differences cannot be bridged with compromise, it always comes down to the killing. The institutional left all over the West has abandoned the cause of defense of the working class against oligarchy and take up the cause of facilitating the genocide of their own peoples. There is no compromise possible here.

                Well, the Left did not come to absolute power by force…nor did liberal democracy for that matter. It came because a few confident guys persuaded moneyed interests and other influencers, then BIG moneyed interests, and then comes the political, financial, and military systems.Other civilizations are powered by big men who kill. Our Western civilization is currently run by managerial types who love narratives and abstract concepts. I wonder if we don’t need Caesar’s army as much as we need Caesar’s graph charts. Not exactly Bronze Age, but maybe this is the key to the same bloodless revolution that the Left imposed on us. And I know, facts and logic doesn’t work on Lefty. I know. But we don’t need Lefty to agree with us…we just need the millions of 95-105 IQ peasants, some with money and influence, to agree with us, or at least agree with a confident rightist such as Vivek.This is actually happening now. There is a groundswell of New Right thinkers that are making an impact politically. Think of all the normiecons that have turned against the ADL and Israel recently. Mere confidence works.

            That’s the wrong way to look at our situation. Forget the big, dramatic event. We need to a million little events to slowly create our own communities that slowly gain more and more autonomy. Boring but far more likely than a Caesar.

Such communities are being demolished by a rapacious ruling class right before your eyes. Your fantasy about “autonomy” runs directly counter to the absolute demands of the State. What do intend to do about it?
My last sentence perfectly describes your attitude.

                    You play the hand that you’re dealt. At the moment, we truly are dissidents. The state has the power and there’s no chance that we can confront that power with a force of our own.The best that we can do for now is try and build local communities (very quietly) and wait for the system to slowly break down, which it is doing.Now, if we were a more cohesive group with people willing to die or go to jail for the cause, sure, we could cripple TPTB. The Irish Troubles come to mind.Our rulers absolutely can deliver a punch but they can’t take a punch. But for now, we can’t throw that punch.

Then what of the Vietcong? Of the Taliban?
The system is indeed slowly breaking down, but like a wounded animal, it is here that it is most dangerous
I was thinking of the “Irish Troubles” as well. A few hundred Provos kept the British Army occupied for thirty years. Such an outcome is certainly possible. As is Spain 1936 – 1939. Or, as in a Matt Bracken nightmare, “Bosnia x Rwanda”.

                        The Vietcong and Taliban had men willing to die for their cause. We don’t.The Vietcong also had outside help.But, yes, I agree that our system and rulers are in a very weak position. It’s why they’re always hysterical. They have no real support.The various law enforcement and military personnel are beginning to realize that they aren’t beloved by the rulers, but they have nice jobs and nice pensions. They don’t want to lose that. But the competent members of those organizations don’t have real loyalty to the system. It’s just about the money.But a pension doesn’t do you much good if you’re worried that something might happen to you as you walk down the street.Our rulers stay in power via fear and bribes. That works for a time, but it can’t beat a group that believes in its cause and has a loyal to that cause and to a people.

                    Central power is becoming more decrepit and illigitimate with each passing day. In less than half a century, it will be too weak to project force to the hinterlands of AINO let alone the GAE. It is then that we secede, and we won’t need 11 legions to do it. Of course, many of us will be dead before that happens. Not very satisfying perhaps, but them’s the breaks.

                        Dear Zaphod: I just returned from three months of solo backpacking and hiking in Guatemala. I was waiting in the jungles of Peten for those damn peccaries. They never showed, the cowards.As for “Founding Questions”: I know nothing about it. I do, however know, that after living for fifteen years south of the Rio Grande and spending my time looking for lost cities, gold mines and hidden pyramids, and being being chased by Latin American militaries and Indigenous tribes, I have learned a few things about how things really are on the ground in Central and South America. Most of what is written is nonsense.I just turned 70 and have acquired a Chiweenie puppy, Marvel by name. As I will never abandon her to go galivanting south of the Rio Grande, my time spent alone in the forests, Andes and jungles of Latin America are at an end.One can only tweak the Grim Reaper for so long.

All the best for your non-jungly Third Act. When Marvel grows up a little you still have the High Plains Drifter type thing to enjoy. No small thing.
You might enjoy the tone and comments at Founding Questions. Guest posts from domain experts are welcomed and popular. Worth googling. You’ll know you’ve found the right place when you see the fine and tasteful escutcheon he’s got parked as the site header.

                Right, but I think that is happening on a very small scale with the ongoing dissolution and fragmentation. Covid came to an “end” because governors and mayors were straying off the plantation. That’s hardly a precise analogy but bolsters your point.

                    The IRA had state backing(US) and didn’t tie up much of the British army. The RUC was the main manpower weapon wielded by the British intelligence agencies.The IRA were treated with kid gloves because of US support and the British elite couldn’t give a fig about Northern Ireland.The IRA also became a creature of the Left so had all kinds of gobal support and the usual Leftist ability to break all the rules and suffer no consequences.Using the IRA as a model: get a foreign power’s support and operate in a part of the country the elite is disinterested in. Maybe adopt a Leftist narrative to explain your struggle.Not sure how useful the IRA is in terms of a template!

            &gt; We need a Caesar…As many have noted, a Caesar is not possible without legions supporting him. That is simply not possible in the modern world.The best we could hope for would be a Putin. A patriot from within the system who’s deep understanding of how the system operates allows him to both advance his agenda and neutralize his opposition. Someone with a *long* memory, diplomatic and patient but ruthless. Who always rewards his loyal allies and finds a way to not just punish, but utterly destroy his enemies.Scanning the list of clowns, diversity hires, and dual-citizens that currently operate in our government, I don’t have much confidence that this sort of person exists at all in the West.

                Our Caesar is a dude who no one’s heard of. He may only be 4 years old now. Or yet to be born. He will take advantage of the situation: if the GAE is still functioning, he will take advantage of a dissident or non-aligned faction, curry favor with them and other skeptics, and win them over with his alpha-male qualities, and most importantly will lift the fortunes and fame of those around him. People will want a piece of his action. He will throw a giant spotlight on the System, not unlike what Trump did. The media will try to ignore him, but he’ll find a way to get through. He will win an election, probably the highest one: President. Without holding any other political office. After that, his main goal is staying alive and keeping his people happy &amp; motivated as the System tries to destroy him. If he stays alive and his support grows, he’ll have to act the tyrant and abolish parts of the system. He can not and will not step down. He’ll be somewhere between a Marius and a Putin. Then after he dies, we hope his successor is as capable as he…The next scenario is easy. The economy and the infrastructure collapses. Someone will step in to take charge. More than likely will be a manly man. Maybe not a dissident, but will be a rightist.

                    Precisely.  He’ll rise through the system, perhaps just one office, the Presidency, and then work like hell to retain that office/power.  This of course can only be done via the destruction of the old process/system.  That destruction might be “rule based” or via violence. That will be the way our “democracy” dies/restructures and a new political system arises to take its place.There are ample precedents.  Folk hate to use the Weimar Republic, but it seems reasonable here.  Mustache man held one office, Chancellor.  He worked like hell to change the elected legislature to his party and when Hindenburg died, he took over the government for good—and boy did things change, that’s the bad part about the story.

            What sort of person seeks office in a “democracy”? A person so crazed by the desire for power that she will say and do anything to attain it, and even more to retain it. No person who gets elected, should.

        Unlike Trump and other phonies, there seems to now be a large number of predictions that Milei will obviously fail to accomplish much of anything.
Perhaps some part of the right is finally learning.
Then there is also another contingent on X-twitter that is very upset with these predictions of failure, so there are still many who refuse to learn.

What I meant to say here is that unlike right after Trumps victory, there I are more people who see are seeing through the act and not giving in to unjustified enthusiasm.

        Question for your Friday show: What is your answer to the low birthrate problem plaguing whites? My answer: Return to the Catholic faith all our ancestors once believed in: not only no abortion, but no contraception and no divorce. Granted the current leadership, beginning with Pope F, is failing badly, even pushing heresy. But when when I got to traditional, Latin Mass parishes, I see many children. It’s true some Evangelical Protestants have large families. But Protestantism always splits into factions, such as those currently hoping the Israel-Hamas War brings on the End Times. Mormonism has large families, but is a weird, quasi-Masonic cult. That leaves Catholicism and waiting for a good, restorationist pope, like St. Pius V.https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12130a.htm

            Are the Catholic laity totally impotent? Or just unconcerned or uninformed or just stupid? They/you *can* take action; there’s no need to wait for a restorationist pope or for anything or anybody else to “do something.”There was, after all, Archbishop Lefebvre, and there is Vigano in Italy and (former) Bishop Strickland and Taylor Marshall in Texas and plenty of others.Get to it! Ignore or defy Francis. The Pachamama Alliance has done it with remarkable results.Cut off the money except to those parishes and dioceses .and organizations that are contending for what is right.Whatever. But waiting is a recipe for disaster.

                It’s going to be weird in a couple generations when the majority of Catholics still going to Church will completely ignore the Vatican, and they will have an underground legion of Bishops to ordain priests the Vatican doesn’t like.

                    Until he got *really* famous, Springsteen had some capacity to transcend solipsism—just a little, just enough to write a couple lines per song that strongly echoed the thoughts of normal men (or normal-man literary characters).
Swift’s popular songs are bitchy celebrity social media posts and, increasingly, “regime messaging,” because to her *and her audience* nothing else is worth communicating—or, really, imaginable.
Springsteen was Reagan, Swift is Obama.
The future has no songs in it.

            There is no such thing as a “Pope Francis”. This degenerate beast is as much a pope as Biden is a president. Bergoglio is an anti-Pope.
The last Pope was Benedict XVI. The Holy See is vacant.

            Catholicism has informal factions. Do you think French Catholicism is the same as that of Spain?
Many of the cultural pathologies people like you try to attribute to Protestantism first manifested in France.

        “We are seeing this in Argentina where the voters elected what can best be described as an autistic Austin Powers character as their next president.”I have visited Argentina several times and noticed that someone looking like Milei is not that exotic there. The country has a retro-vibe, not only because it has been in decline for a long time, but there is something about the local culture that comes off as a mix of the 70’s, 80’s and current year. I kind of liked it, actually.Now, Milei is weird in the sense that he claims to be an anarcho-capitalist who would like to become a “chosen” person… but again, even this somehow fits into what I have seen in Buenos Aires.

            I have never been and I know no one who has been there. It is one of those places that does not turn up in a lot of travel sites for some reason. Tons of Americans go to Brazil and Mexico. The thought a country in leisure suits and sideburns is amusing.

                I think there may be tens of thousands of American expats in Buenos Aires, or at least they used to be there.
The first time I went there, in 2007, was when I read Doug Casey’s words: “This place is going to boom, I can feel it!” But after I met some local business people, I realized that Argentina is a country of infinitely unfulfilled potential… forever. I still loved the vibe though. It reminded me of old Italian or French movies.

                        Yes, if you like hot and humid weather. I always went between December to March and it was great. December may be better, because there are not that many mosquitos yet.
If you want to go to Buenos Aires, going in January/February also has the added advantage of less people and relative calmness, because many locals are away on their vacations.

                        Buenos Aires doesn’t get that cold even in July — a sweater and light jacket is enough. Maybe some heating in the evenings. Further south it must be getting colder. In January and February it can get hot and you would want some air-conditioning.

                        Plenty of Argentine restaurants exist, but the cuisine may seem plain to someone who is used to the usual American multi-culti experience.
As for “unremarkable” sights – Aconcagua, the highest mountain outside of the Himalayas is located in Argentina, the Iguazu falls, the largest waterfall system in the world, are located in Argentina; the lake district around Bariloche is amazing, the vineyards in Mendoza are some of the best in the world, etc. etc.

Nothing is forever. Yeah, I’ve been waiting 20 years for that to change. I’ve got a son, his wife and my three grandchildren living 60 yards away. He’s an engineer with a water-well drilling business which is going well (no pun intended) but if Milei’s gov. can institute the promised reforms, the business can begin to realize its full potential and the kid’ll be able to hire someone to peel my grapes.

                        I posed a late question to you yesterday that got lost in the shuffle: has Milei taken a position on migration? I shudder at the thought as he is a libertarian. I know migration has been a problem there for a long time, and most likely ethnic Europeans are a minority or close to it at this point.

                    I lived and worked in Buenos Aires for ten years (1993 – 2003). Some observations:1. The Argentines positively, absolutely hate blacks. Not a criticism mind you.2. The ruling classes of Argentina are the most loathsome I have ever encountered. Their children are worse.3. Argentine women are some of the most stunningly beautiful one could imagine. Only Israelis and Venezuelans can compete.4. Backpacking in Argentina is superb, second only to that in Peru.5. There is no food in Argentina save for beef. It is the finest on earth. The wines are drinkable.6. If your skin is not lily white, you are suspect. North West Argentina resembles Peru in demographics and geography, but is ignored by by most Argentines.

Another thing about Argentina is that it is one of the biggest places for psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Tons of therapists and patients, maybe the most outside of NYC. I don’t know if the original Freudian model is dominant or whether as in the US that’s largely been supplanted by modified versions.
The climate in the non-mountainous regions is roughly similar to that of the southeast US.

            It’s one of my favorite countries to visit and a lot safer than Brazil although I advise leaving your bling back home — you’ll have a gun in your face within a few minutes if you wear a Rolex in Buenos Aries for example as happened to a MARSOC colonel friend. The culture is European combined with S. American pizzaz. Price is right. The rural areas and Patagonia provide gorgeous views. I highly recommend a visit if you employ smart travel practices.

Sounds like a paradise compared to the USA.
Is the crime mostly generated by that mestizo contingent?

                        TBH, I am not sure about their crime stats.
I did notice a complete absence of blacks.When I asked a local about it, he said “We used to have them, but they have mysteriously disappeared”.

                        “Is the crime mostly generated by that mestizo contingent?”
Depends on the kind of crime you mean. Most crime is committed by gov’t officials.
Bolivians and Paraguayans are flooding into Argentina, and they are not white. It’s become as real problem:

                There is still something of a Catholic undercurrent in Argentina as well. You can see this when you stop at a roadside cafe/gas station and inside there will be yards of curios that are all various crucifixes and representations of the Virgin Mary.In the countryside, there are lots of fairly friendly stray dogs around. The beef and wine are excellent, as others have also reported.In Argentina, it is extremely difficult to find anywhere that takes credit cards, other than the typical US fast food franchises (Burger King, etc.). Trying to get a local SIM for my cell was also difficult.As far as cash exchange, I’d avoid trying to get the unofficial ‘blue rate’ from the groups of street hustlers unless your Spanish is on point and you have 2 or 3 friends with you. As a solo traveler, you’re better off finding a Western Union with a wizened older fellow that is happy to help a semi-bumbling yanqui get some pesos.

                    Be sure to save a chunk of those pesos for the “leaving the country tax” the regime hits you with before they let you on your flight.
