        It seems people will work harder to change things than they will to keep things from changing. And lunatic fanatics are more dedicated to their cause than are those who are satisfied with the way things are, and just want to be left alone. Change can even get politicians elected.

        Goy,Your comments are appreciated. A related observation I have made in recent years is that while children today aspire to being adolescents (when before they looked forward to becoming adults, a critical devolution), adults today also aspire to be adolescents! It is the ideal state where mindless hedonism and raging hormones can flourish. If you make enough money you can go right back there again.Tangential to the “endless compromise” you cite, I just had a conversation with one of those liberals who believes the nation has been only trending conservative since the 1960s. I have encountered this type before and it is quite a curious outlook. They are typically Boomers and how they miss the fact that the Republicans have been only a half-step behind the Dems as they slash their way through anything and anyone that smells of tradition for the last 50 years is beyond me.As for cycling, it is one of the merciful aspects of the natural order.

        Hannon, IMHO you have hit the nail squarely, and have also echoed here a thesis I have promoted for years. That is, only ‘adult children’ – or Moral Adolescents as I have come to see them – are attracted to the socially suicidal, narcissist fetish that comprises collectivist, nanny-state ideology.Once examined from a clinical standpoint, where the moral sensibilities that drive one’s notions of ethical priority can be analyzed, it turns out that this behavior is actually quite predictable. The problem we face as a society today is that moral adolescence is not only self-reaffirming in a lateral sense, but also self-perpetuating in a generational sense. That each successive generation of Americans since, oh, the New Deal, appears to exhibit a more pervasive level of moral adolescence does not bode well for the sustainability of this nation.Self-labeled ‘conservatives’ (i.e., classical liberals) haven’t recognized any of this as yet, and persist in endless compromise with morally adolescent ideologues as if they were fully realized adults with a legitimate point of view. The resulting policy ratchets our society and our culture closer to the abyss with each successive session of Congress.As time goes on, I become convinced that some version or form of this phenomenon is responsible for the rise-and-fall cycle of every past civilization/culture – from the Greeks’ to the Brits’.http://bit.ly/DmoX7

        Your last point is one that has been observed often: that leftward thinkers capable of rational thought tend to plan and execute the future they want to see. They have been very successful over the last 2-3 generations. Conservatives and the mainstream are their foil, essential for traction but remaining relatively inert and hardly generating inspired, energetic planning of their own. This is essentially an unchanging relationship owing to the nature of both groups. We are the responsibility-minded parents and they are the adult children run amok in the toy store. They will inherit the wind.
