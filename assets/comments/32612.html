        The Western welfare state has eclipsed the Church. A large portion of the Church’s success was not necessarily its theology or its mythology, but the actual parallel society it created and the social services it provided when the government served no purpose other then to kill you and take your money. As Augustine wrote, “What are kingdoms but a great band of robbers?”Church provided entertainment, festivals, meals, and care for infants, the sick and the old. Over time politicians, starting with Constantine, saw the appeal of this and aligned themselves with Christianity. (As Machiavelli pointed out, this was not always sincere, but it was necessary if they wanted to hold power).But the 20th century welfare state took this to an entirely new level. The services provided by the Catholic Church in particular — thousands of hospitals and schools, homes for the aged staffed by nuns, etc. — have been wholly co-opted by the government, which does not ask for donations from the pews to pay for it but forces taxpayers to pay for it. Consequently the services can be greater and more expensive (compare the athletic grounds or the art department — and the teacher salaries — of your local Catholic school to a wealthy suburban public school). The recipients of those services are not lectured about avoiding mortal sin, either; to the contrary the government actively promotes the Seven Deadly Sins.Thus the elites are creating an entirely new moral framework and a pseudo-official state religion to replace Christianity.This will not end well, probably as a Huxleyan dystopia, but the public will be assured by the government they no longer live in a society of “homophobic bigotry” or “slut shaming” or “religious intolerance” and they enjoy “reproductive rights” as consolation.

            This was excellent thanks! I would only add that these Elites care only for power and define the “people” and their “welfare” way differently from what our definitions are.

            A lot of commenters here have the odd belief that every thing needs to be practical or useful . Christianity “works” so let’s use it.
humans want to know. Having a fake religion that works for entertaining or collecting and distributing charity is worthless. A religion s either true or it isn’t.
if a false religion just works than to hell with it. Where’s the real thing that’s what I want.

                The problem as I see it, Hi-ya, is in trying to use a political history and language as a framework for understanding the afterlife or observed spiritual phenomena.
It’s like trying to write an engine manual using a woman’s romance novel as the scientific foundation, instead of metallurgy, fuels, machining, etc.
You’re right, we want toknow.What, how, why- what’s it for?

        Erwin Chemerinsky is the dean of Berkeley’s law school, the most prestigious on the West Coast. He was a student at Harvard Law with Merrick Garland, where both were taught by Lawrence Tribe. There’s a video of C. telling students to ignore court rulings agains affirmative action, and just do it anyway, but don’t tell anybody. C. just came out for entirely junking the Constitution because it is “undemocratic” and starting over with what inevitably would be a Bolshevik document.https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-08-23/constitution-undemocratic-amendments-rewrite

            A very similar article, that even referenced Chemerinsky and people of similar ethnic origins, was put up by the New York Times a few days ago. I doubt it is a coincidence. They are trying to lay the groundwork for something.

            The first open call for internet censorship I remember seeing, a column at Slate or Vox or whatever (same people), had an odd honesty: The First Amendment must be destroyed because Laurence Tribe looks stupid on Twitter.America’sgreatest legal minddoes nothing but get “owned by randos” (refuted by any slightly knowledgeable layman) and repeat stupid nonsense he half-overheard on MSNBC. The public being able to see that this man held up as ourmostrightful leader is just another retarded propaganda victim undermines Our Democracy—the faith of the people in their rulers’ election.Itcannot bethat the elect—political, professional, ethnic, etc.—are frauds. Our Hierarchy isrightand it getsrighter every day(and says so).If its trajectory toward perfection can’t be maintained in a Constitutional environment, then, hey ho, Western Civ has got to go.

            Every. Single. Time.again? One wonders which of the world repairers have the right stuff to become theHugo Preußof the USA.
Probably many readers here still don’t know the significant role of EST in the rise of the so-called Third Reich. Hugo’s centralizing, authoritarian constitution was designed with despotism in mind and imposed in 1919, same year as the Bavarian Soviet Republic (also very EST). The constitution of the “Weimar” republic remainedthebasic law for almost 26 years.

                Wikipedia: “The Jewish background of the main author of its constitution was one reason why the Weimar Republic was referred to asJudenrepublik(“Jews’ Republic”) by its detractors on the right.”
Wait, what? Weimar Germany was internally occupied, in the same vein as MacArthur’s Japan?
Further, “Only a few days after the abdication ofEmperor Wilhelm IIhad been announced during theGerman Revolution of 1918–19…”, when the Eastern commies, in overthrowing the Russian monarchy (Tsar), then went for the German Kaiser…

                TL;DR they’re all jewish.The framing of why they wanted somethingBolzhevikisn’t terribly important, the point is the outcome they are seeking*.If it was framed as Libertarian open-borders, the intention is the same even if one wants to argue those are theoretically diametrically opposed ideologies.Whatever reasoning or story the car salesman gives you is almost entirely beside the point; the essential piece is the goal of getting you to buy.Similarly, I don’t agree with Zed’s thrust in this post, such that the rulers are fanatically tied to their goal of Public Welfare or whatever, but are misguided.The people that matter know exactly what they are doing and their goal, regardless of what cover story they are giving you.*These people want you broke, dead, your kids raped and brainwashed, and they think it’s funny.

            Unfortunately is is basically afait accompli— they already ignore the Constitution, and it has already been scrapped, starting with Lincoln.
Look, I admire and support the republican principles outlined in the Constitution as much as anybody, but let’s face it, the document was written by and for white Protestants.
When you have the likes of (((Chemerinsky))) and (((Tribe))) instructing legions of law students on what the Constitution supposedly does or does not mean, it’s already been lost.
Conservatives need to start understanding this reality.

            Erwin Chemerinsky used to be a regular on the Hugh Hewitt show when based in CA. Hugh would have him and a fellow prof from Chapmen University on his show. It was sort of a Mutt and Jeff (faux) debate. In any event Chemerinsky always appeared to be a rabid Leftie and could be sure to take the opposite position from anything even remotely resembling the conservative point of view. Those days the discussion was most often upon how SCOTUS ruled on a particular case or perhaps the selection of new justices.Even in those days of my benightedness, I always wondered how a professor of Constitutional law could have so little regard for, well, The Constitution. If he’s jumped the shark, then that’s perhaps a good sign. For one, there’s no deniability left for him, and two he sounds desperate. I suspect that’s because for the first time in decades and decades, the SCOTUS is undeniably “conservative” (as Leftists see it, not necessarily the DR).  I might also add the “jury nullification” has most often come up in the conservative circles I entertain wrt gun laws and their imposition.  It’s not for Lefties per se.  It’s a tactic for all.

        “It will be how well they safeguard the welfare of the people.”
I find it extremely hard to believe that they think they are safeguarding the welfare of the people.  Everything they do shows how much they hate us.  They would not be doing most of what they do if they didn’t hate us or even gave a minor thought of our welfare.
They are the sworn enemies of the people, not our protectors.

                Exactly, Line, and once official history had been re-written to hide the crime, the ethnic origination was also forgotten, even by its writers. The allegiance becomes one of class rather than “race”.
Just as the conservatives think as themselves as a New Israel of the New Covenant, the liberals also identify as a New Israel, under a New Covenant.  Thus we have our own people seeing themselves as a new Volk, and our old rules don’t apply to their morally superior selves.

        We are very near a point in the Ukraine where we either have to accelerate or withdraw. Acceleration will burden and harm the American public as well as Europes peoples. Withdrawal will harm NATO and the American empires hold on Europe.I am hoping Europe can somehow break away from our caretakers of the new religion and stand on their own feet again.We are heading for hard times but perhaps hard times is what we must have to break this new religions power.

            The ruling elite here will destroy Europe before they let them go. In a supreme bit of insanity, the ruling elite in Europe are happy to go along with that plan.

            We will withdraw, we are simply looking for an off ramp.  If this was not already decided, we’d be escalating immediately as time is not on our side.  If the neocons were not so decided, they’d drive the war up into a conflict that the new government come next year could not afford to lose.  This is not saying the neocons have been defeated, just that they’ve turned their future intentions elsewhere.

                Yes. The neocons cannot be embarrassed. The political actors, despite their sociopathy, can be. They will try to delay the utterly predictable outcome until after November. I have no idea whether this is possible, but it is the plan.

                    And Putin will continue to strengthen his military forces and economy and not be goaded into any precipitous actions.  The man has no ego to assuage.  He’s already thinking to futures and that lies within Europe as a trading partner.  Europe “may” be on the verge of change as well as seen by nascent political movements.
That’s the problem with short term, next election thinking, as we have in the US.  It’s really not conducive to 3D chess.

            It seems to me that the global economy has did it’s job, too well for our ruling elites. The citizens of the West will not tolerate a real war. The military can play in the desert and drone sheep herders but they can’t go to war with China or Russia, because it would have too much of an impact on the economy. There is a lot of economic inertia that will have to be overcome to have a war.Perhaps this is why they are swamping the West with people who have much lower expectations. A ruined economy is much better than the poverty in their villages in South America, and so even an America in ruins still looks good to them.

        Here’s the thing: Any casual reader of Zman knows his dissatisfaction for what is known as democracy. Fine. The problem is that the governing bodies currently in control of the US, GB, and most of the rest of the West are not democracies. The US was never a democracy to begin with. Even most of the more loony leftist normies in the US never physically voted for unchecked immigration and or sending billions of dollars to Ukraine. I’m not sure any political candidates have recently campaigned on “vote for me, and I’ll ensure your tax dollars get sent overseas to fund foreign conflicts!”It’s similar to the people who condemn capitalism based upon the current economic/financial situation in the US. Guess what, that ain’t capitalism. Crony corporatism is a more accurate description of our current economic model, but even that probably doesn’t fully describe it.Anyway, the point is calling the current form of tyranny “democracy” so it can be condemned is dishonest. Literally almost not a single person has voted for Komoto Harris to be president, and yet here she stands as the Democratic (not democratic) nominee for president. That ain’t democracy. It ain’t republicanism either.Further, in a multiculty mess, of course democracy cannot work. Neither can socialism for that matter. Modern political models can only work with homogeneous populations. So condemning it simply isn’t looking far enough upstream. Politics and economics can’t even be realistically addressed until the population is fixed.That leaves nothing else to talk about though does it? No money in that….

                He does have a point about the current western system not being an actual democracy, but the same can be said about the formerly communist countries (“real communism has not been tried”), and while we’re at it, UK is not a real monarchy either.

                    The error here is in thinking “democracy” only means the mechanism, as in voting. That is not how our rulers use the term. They use it to mean the general will of the people, even if the people do not realize it. All ideologues must embrace the concept of false consciousness, as it is the only suitable explanation for why the masses do not agree with the ideology.

You assume these people are rational and therefore know what they are saying is false, which means they are cynical in their presentation. In reality, these people believe what they are saying.

                                We can agree to disagree.“Saving our monarchy” or “saving our communism” wouldn’t make sense. Hence, we must “save our democracy”. It’s just a thing they say. When I talk to someone who spouts this nonsense, they can’t really explain why they say that. They just “know” that the other side is bad and they were thought that democracy is good. They are not necessarily rational.In my experience, the true believers are usually at the lower ranks. Like the local bureaucrats or regional politicians. This was obvious even during the Covid fiasco. There is no way the actual decision makers at the top and centre of it all were sincere in their efforts to save humanity from a deadly virus. It’s the same with “democracy”.

                                        Perhaps. However, if I call you antisemitic, it doesn’t have to be because I think you hate jews, but because it’s an effective way to shut you up and if I “defend democracy”, maybe it’s for the same reasons and it gives me an advantage over you. For example when my name is Zelensky and I am banning and locking up all opposition. That’s because I believe in democracy.Words have meanings, but in the current year, those meanings are a little more flexible than usual.Full disclosure: I don’t care about the arguments whether the US a republic or a democracy etc. I just don’t believe that our rulers are misunderstood creatures that want to do what they believe is the will of the masses.

                                You are absolutely correct. If I didn’t have close family who fall squarely into the category of “these people” who I have been analyzing and attempting to un-social-engineer for a decade now, I might have fallen into this mistake too.The meaning of labels change. 200 years ago if a European called himself a ‘conservative’ then other Europeans and the educated from other civilizations would have know exactly what he meant: he was self-identifying as a monarchist. Later, in an American context at least, it changed to mean someone who opposed the excesses of progressivism, but only to the extent of cleaning up their messes, not ending their evil. Now it means whore-traitor lickspittle servant of the transnational oligarchy.Their belief in “our democracy” is inextricably tied up into their personal identity formation. The meaning they attach to “democracy” is not most people think. They are Janissaries, but not for Islam, for a Jewish project of ‘repairing the world’ which can only come to fruition when it has been conquered and enslaved with (non-Jewish) ethnic identity erased and replaced with “citizen-(slave) of the the world”.The destruction of traditional culture and mores has left Americans rootless. I consider rootlessness even more of a contributing vulnerability than the godlessness. Ethnocentrism and the expulsion of transnationalism is the only way to preserve the civilizational immune system.People from other civilizations should take note. If these beasts succeed in destroying Europeanity they are coming for you next, with our miscegenated children as their cannon fodder.

                        Exactly. How I tired of these midwits pointing out that the term “democracy” is specific to a bunch of ancient Greeks sitting around the agora to vote on political matters and therefore we are not a democracy.
The term “democracy” is used conventionally to mean *any* political system where the citizenry have a voice in their leadership. This takes many forms, electing representatives to voice one’s concerns and desires being one of them.  That our present form of democracy works poorly—or not at all—is not the issue.

Our betters have internalized this. Not cynically. Like our host, I agree the most parsimonious explanation is that they are true believers. They genuinely believe there is no difference between boys and girls.

                        While the observation is hardly original by me, our rulers currently define “democracy” as preservation of institutions that protect and enrich them rather than anything to do with the individual. This wasn’t a widely accepted definition in the West even a generation or so back although there was truth to it even then. The “general will” you reference are those institutions and while the ideology evolves as needed, those power monopoly mechanisms do not. Information and to some extent voting is harder to control now so the Ruling Class is doubling down on protecting the institutions and will redefine “democracy” continuously to preserve and maintain status. It is a constant throughout history and rule by force almost always is the endpoint.

                            “Democracy” is more of a malleable process, or even a fungible, collective state of mind than it is an actual form of government. That is one reason it has historically been held in such low regard. Universal suffrage, in particular, is especially noxious, as it is always nothing but camouflage for a plutocratic type of oligarchy. The poor sell their votes to the rich, and the rich, who didn’t get rich by being stupid, pay for those votes with the money of the middle class (or borrow it, which is the same thing).Voting, to the extent it exists at all, should be a privilege earned, rather than a right granted.

                                    No, but many of the nouveau rich are *lucky*.  Take Zuckerberg for example.  He dabbled on a piece of software while at Harvard to attract an audience of his peers (and perhaps get laid at the same time).  The timing and conditions—technology &amp; social media beginnings—coincided.He got there basically first, but that was never his original intention—MySpace notwithstanding—and here he is today, using his wealth (power) to change election results, dealing with the Fed’s (i.e. the devil) to the detriment of free speech, and selling our personal data to the highest bidder.  All while we squabble over whether he is a “true believer” or not.  Does it matter?

                            The raison d’etre of the Left is accretion of raw power. Things are defined and redefined with that endpoint in mind. If a change in terminology will not suffice, something like “mistakes were made” will be deployed. With power accumulation as the only goal, any tool or mode of thought that helps is used. Democracy is a train to a certain destination, and if not that, Leninism or any other mode of transportation. One will be called the other as needed.

                        Perhaps you should have waited a bit longer and calmed down before replying to my comment as to avoid looking like a petulant asshole.  Using the term democracy in any sense other than what it really means is in fact, dishonest.  YOU saying that I called you a liar is also, in fact, dishonest.  I did no such thing. And our rulers absolutely do not use the term democracy to mean “the general will of the people.” – they could care less what the will of the people is.  If anything they use it to mean the will of their own. Or simply “what we say is Good.”The fact that you immediately resort to silly insults and threats merely speaks to your own insecurities about what you wrote, not me projecting.Democracy means exactly what it is defined as, not what we want it to mean so we can make a point.If you want to ban me, go ahead.  I could literally not care less.

                                    Mike Tre.  You had an implication wrt Z-man being intentionally dishonest.  I myself overlooked it.  Hell, this is a forum and with time constraints, we can’t spend hours writing and rewriting because someone’s “feelings” might be hurt.
Which brings us to the second observation, Z-man has loyal followers who are most often more sensitive wrt “feelings” than Z-man himself.  This is also normal and expected.
Your follow up reply to Z-man clarifies things greatly—your comment was a valid observation worth sharing, whereas strongly felt, but not designed to gratuitously attack.  I’d let the initial reply from Z-man go.

            Oh give me a break. You’re just like the Communists who bleat about how “real Communism has never been tried!” I am so sick and tired of being told that every abuse against us by the monied elite isn’t “true Capitalism.” The problem with any abstract ideology or system of polity is they never deliver on their promised ends because human nature will always, always find a way to mess things up. All you do with this “well ackshully” BS is divert people from focusing on the problem of our evil masters who never cared about your precious ideology to begin with.

                I never said capitalism hasn’t been tried.  All I said was what is called capitalism now, isn’t acksually capitalism.  You have a point about what you call abstract ideologies, but be serious, are we in the US right at this moment living our lives under the workings of a legitimate constitutional republic?  Be serious. You’re just white knighting like so many people do when another person dares not completely agree in lockstep with the article’s author.

            I can’t find it, but there was a great democracy-talk apothegm or precis here (post to main Z blog), went something like: voters define “democracy” as getting what they want via hired officials, and hired officials define it as getting what they want via persuasion of the voters. Saying that low-quality input deciders leads you to the same hijacking status quo is merely a semantic point– professional democracy detractors already agreed with that. It’s an inherently defective system. End of quote, as Brandon might say

            Boomer, the fact that the ideas of Democracy and Capitalism have failed proves that either they were faulty or the people were faulty, either way arguing that we just haven’t tried democracy/capitalism hard enough yet is….. tiresome. I personally, believe that the people are the secret ingredient and nearly any system will be made to work by an honest, and intelligent people. Remember the Scandanivians make socialism spin like a top, but we’re about to bankrupt the country trying to follow their example.

                Not true. Sweden frittered away basically all the capital stock including most of the social capital before wisely pivoting away. Their fortune was at that time, they still had not been overrun by the darker and swarthier. They have been more capitalist than the US for decades. Norway is running behind Sweden, but, like the Gulf states and Venezuela, they have massive oil income that lets them conceal the loss of capital, but the capital consumption is nonetheless real.

        “Despite most Americans never having heard of Cicero, the spirit of this age is animated by the simple concept behind that Latin phrase. It is what lies behind the urge to censor speech online, for example. The welfare in question when demanding you get booted from social media is the psychological health of the people. The censors assume that they are the guardians of the mental peace and tranquility, so they must make sure that deviationists like you are silenced.”It pleases you to jest with us. That may be the ostensible reason given but not the real one.“Of course, Cicero would have been baffled by what is happening in this age, especially since he was murdered by agents of the Second Triumvirate, for the crime of speaking out against the tyranny of Mark Antony.”I doubt it, and he certainly wouldn’t have been baffled once he had his head lopped off. Throughout history, question or criticise the powerful, or their narrative, and nasty things happen to you.“From the perspective of the ancient world, what we are seeing today is the worst form of government, democracy.”Not democracy the way they understood it, which was essentially mob rule. What we have is an entrenched oligarchy which never shows its face and camouflages itself behind democratic trappings.“Your efforts to reason with them or point to tradition are viewed by the ruling class as a radical rejection of their primary duty, which is to safeguard the welfare of the people.”Again, you jest with us. What “people?” A great replacement is underway in all western countries. And the ruling class is not rooted in what used to be the people of two generations ago. It doesn’t see their welfare as its responsibility and is perhaps even hostile to it.

            If the ruling elite were to take the task of protecting the welfare of the people seriously, they certainly would not tolerate an invasion by foreigners, sacrifice the people’s blood and treasure for the sake of imperial adventurism, and permit the enervation of vast swaths of the people by opioids.So, “what people” indeed. The function of the ruling class is to promote, or at least defend, the welfare of the people, wherethe peopleis understood as the citizens of the country. Suppressing speech or incarcerating citizens for complaining can in no way be construed as being in service of the people. To represent it as such is lying, plain and simple.

        “Your efforts to reason with them or point to tradition are viewed by the ruling class as a radical rejection of their primary duty, which is to safeguard the welfare of the people.”If the above is to be believed, then one must assume benign intentions on the part of the ruling elite.  However, that is an assumption not in evidence.  Rather my perception is that “safeguarding the welfare of the people” is mere pretext for power and control meant to benefit themselves, rather than the “people”.Yes, there are those in the service of the elite who actually believe in the goodness of their intentions.  They are but “useful idiots” so to speak.  I reject today’s missive—wholly and completely.  We are not under attack by well meaning people.Better, as Hans-Hermann Hoppe points out, to have a King in charge.  A king will protect the people, because in essence the people and the kingdom belong to him, and that which weakens this, weakens him

                That’s the real question are they really “benign intentions” and I would say for the puppets maybe but for the shot callers no they know exactly what they are doing and it’s not benign at all…
To be honest though does it even matter why they are doing it? The real question I think is does it cause you harm and then what are you doing to minimize/mitigate that harm…

                    This has always been the case. The poor, since they don’t have anything, are free to focus upon their faith, but the ruling class are forced to balance faith against the pragmatic demands of maintaining the institutions, and if they make a meager profit from those efforts then surely it can be justified by the importance of their work.

                I believe I take exception to your assertion of “primary duty” and that being the “welfare of the people”. I reject this assertion. I don’t believe they care one wit about the people, as in the masses. They do care about themselves and their position within society—as in sitting on top of it and controlling it to “their” benefit. The “welfare of society” only interests them as to their own benefit, not society’s.We may be talking past each other here. I’ve mentioned the elites’ “useful idiots” who may indeed think they operate from benign intentions. Those folk would be closer to the concept of the managerial State you often decry. But those who have true controlling power are but a tiny few. Those are the ones who run the show. Those are the ones I speak about.

                    While I am extremely sympathetic to your view here, it’s not really in evidence.  We suspect there is a shadowy cabal (the real power) behind the scenes, even if we have guessed right, it’s not like we know who these people are (as opposed to the deepstate).  There are too many rich people to say it’s just a cabal of the wealthy. Different rich people have different interests that are often at odds with the interests of other rich people.  While we can be sure our owners are rich, we don’t know which ones.When we see the “elite” talking about their beloved globohomo, their minds are twisted into knots justifying all their beliefs.  It is possible that a large majority really are true believers.  Of course, their true beliefs are satanic.

                        Being rich isn’t enough for entry into the Power Structure. You have to be mega-rich (such people are rare), and hold the korrekt views. Alternately, you must hold a position of very high status in academia or the media.

                            True. There also is something of a caste system at play. Bill Gates, for example, checks all those boxes yet he gets dragged as needed. For example, he is one of the more prominent Clouds swept up in the Epstein op. His Beyond Meat is on its death bed. Public divorce with hints of perversion. Etc. My take is he never can be one of the elect despite his money and views. It may be due to something as ridiculous as his lack of academic credentials, but regardless he will never be part of the club. It likely makes him bitter.

                        No, they don’t have conference calls to discuss “affairs”, but they have great wealth, which translates into power—and their number one interest is to retain that wealth.  To that effect they do what they need to do for themselves to retain/increase such wealth.  I do not believe there is thought wrt the “little people”—either for society’s benefit or otherwise.That rich folk squabble among themselves means little to me.  That there are even some elites who seem to profess the common persons’ interests—example, Musk lately—is the exception that proves the rule (IMO).Perhaps I’m too much into “the banality of evil” as was coined by philosopher and political theorist Hannah Arendt.  In short, the whole thing may simply be organic and a byproduct of extreme wealth.

                        Pretty sure you are right. I used to rub shoulders with deca-millionaires back when that was enough to get on Forbes’ List, and they were nothing like the popular characterizations. They weren’t grasping to maintain wealth. They knew if hard times struck, it didn’t really matter. They would rise above it again. Lot of truth to that. Most of them were objectively better than the common man. But they also genuinely thought that their business acumen meant that whatever other opinions they had were right, too. Even the beliefs that were objectively Satanic.The biggest hurdle for most or maybe all people is projection. Because most of us have to be careful with the pennies, we assume everyone else is similarly “greedy”, and those with the most the most “greedy”. Those with more power more power-mad. It’s an easy trap to fall into, and leads to irrational anger or despair, depending on the person.Like Zman says, you can’t know a man’s real motive. The closest you can come is imagining what you might think and do if you were in that same situation.

                    I don’t think so. There exist sociopaths, sure, but not in numbers sufficient to explain it. The caricature that gets drawn of them is almost always wrong, IMO. They genuinely see themselves as saviors of society. The good guys. Even the full-on commies do this, via the rationalization of “mystification” or “false consciousness”. To them, J6 really was an “insurrection”, a coup to overthrow the country.

                        “Science” says 1 in 100 of us are sociopaths, at the low end. That’s a lot of people. 3 or 4 million in AINO alone. Some say as high as 1 in 25. Now we’re up to 12 million. In current year, I can believe the bigger number.

                            Fair, though I take that with a grain of salt. The shrinks only get paid if they treat someone for something, so obviously their incentive is to expand the number of people who are in need of their help. Heck, one of the more recent entries in DSM is ODD, Oppositional Defiance Disorder. Anyone who questions the authorities is presumptively suffering from ODD unless proven otherwise.
Oh, and forgot. Sociopaths are all over the economic spectrum. Some are highly intelligent, high functioning individuals, while others are trailer trash. And nogs are disproportionately affected, as one might predict from violence propensity.

                                Sure, there’s variation in sociopaths, but typically we find an unusual—as in nonrandom—distribution among top leaders in the business world and other essential areas.  To me this makes sense as often a strategy to get “ahead” is to use and abuse people in your way to the top.

                                    Maybe. I tend to think most cases of “mental illness” are just cases of “first world problems”. The shrink boom of the 70s was driven by it becoming trendy for one to speak of “his therapist”.
Similarly, “sociopathy” is probably not to the degree we are told, any more than is trannyism. It’s just that there are situations where it is to one’s advantage. No sociopath cares about his employees, so presenting as an aloof sociopath can be a winning strategy in labor disputes.
There’s a reason the officers don’t fraternize with the enlisted. And it’s not mental illness.

                            And a sociopath believes in one thing above all else- him or herself, and the rightness of their cause. You can’t argue them out of that fundamental foundation.
Those around them, like have self-doubt, because they’re normal.  The confidence of a socio draws us in like moths to a flame, as we’d all like to share some of that confident certainty.

                Fair enough. In the end, a distinction without a difference. We are both being screwed, but there won’t be a “Forgive them for they know not what they do” as my last words.

                I always note that morally, or in any schema, the anointed try to outdo the normies. To be betterer in whatever they’ve concocted.
I’m not going to adopt some poor white’s baby, I’m going to adopt a Haitian with AIDS!
I’m not going to mow that old lady’s lawn down the street, I’m going to save heathens in Africa!
I’m not going to get a 40% reduction in pollution with natural gas, I’m going NetZero to save the planet!

        I suspect Europe, and probably the US willover the next 40-yearsturn into some form of what we are all familiar with in South Africa.Of course the US will fare much better since it is a more resource rich country and is energy independent. Of course Europe could return to nuclear, but until then, our economy will remain stunted with businesses closing due to higher energy costs making it impossible for us to compete in cheaper energy countries. In both cases, the local brain power to keep the lights on and the water running will begin to disappear just like in South Africa.But let’s not kid ourselves, the so called immigration crisis is just a distraction.We all know the demographic balance tipped 40 years ago. The on-rush since 2015 certainly didn’t help Europe, and recent arrival of over 8+ million in the past 4-years in the US with the recent uncontrolled border crossing. However none of that changes anything. It simply pushes us ahead on a path we’ve been on for decades.With Christianity successfully nullified in the West and removed from our cultural values and morals, the next major clash will be between secular humanism and Islam as we are already starting to see in the UK.

            Perhaps it is the sunny optimism for which I am known, but I think things break long before the great extinction many assume is an inevitable end to what we are seeing. The West will get suddenly poorer in the next decade. This will change the math of immigration. If Germany, for example, is unable to provide generous social welfare benefits, will the migrants stay? Will the native population remain passive about such policies? Much of what has happened over the last three decades was made possible by the relative high standard of living in the West. This bourgeois ideology is only possible in a bourgeois society.

                I hope you’re right, especially with your timeline, and I hope that countries like Germany don’t find some external source to fund the migrant welfare programs.
Currently, these kind of external sources exist in poorer EU countries, like Portugal and former commie block. The EU is providing money to allow Indian and African invaders settle in their cities and rural areas. Germany won’t have that option, unless the ECB is willing to destroy the Euro for it or the US decides to print a few trillion more to help out.

                The response of the Wogs to the disappearance of gibs will be interesting. On the one hand, they could pack up their ol’ kit bag and beat a retreat to the Stans and the jungles. On the other, they could engage their penchant for violence and destruction by burning Europe down to the studs and stealing anything of value. It’s not as if anybody will say boo to them if they do.
Which outcome is more likely? Difficult to say, and I wouldn’t want to live on the difference.

                I believe immigration reform across Europe is inevitable at various levels as we are seeing with Poland, Hungary and now Denmark. Not so much because of the concerns for human rights or to reduce crime against European citizens, but because politicians are terrified these recent knife attacks and published crime statistics will promote public sympathy to far-right wing group; aka – the AfD. These changes in policy have nothing to do with the will of the people, but the desperate and deliberate attempt by the established elites to remain in power.The following article may be of interest. Sorry, this is only in German, but you can right click on the page and select “Translate to English”.https://www.nzz.ch/international/zukunft-der-asylpolitik-deutschland-schaut-nach-daenemark-und-schweden-ld.1844768?mktcid=nled&amp;mktcval=146&amp;kid=nl146_2024-9-2&amp;ga=1Miguel Berger, who is the Ambassador of Germany to the UK said in a recent interview that “Politicians have to stop calling voters neo-Nazis and take them seriously”. Without coming out and saying it directly, this is a result of the recent voting outcome where in Thüringen the AfD got 32% of the vote, second after the CDU and the greens were kicked out entirely. In Sachsen the AfD took 40%, again second only after the CDU. However, since none of the opposition parties are likely to work with the AfD at all, the coalition governments will join around the leading CDU party in their respective States in a direct effort against any policy changes pushed by the AfD.You must understandThüringenis a relatively poor state by German standards owing to severe economic problems following German reunification in 1990 and like Sachsen, while some production still exists, employment has declined drastically and has become worse with the recent energy policies which have made production less and less competitive in Germany.Of course these are and always have been hard-core East German states with a very anti-foreigner (anti-American) attitudes. But also a very high educational standards thanks to the former DDR and USSR influence.As for those immigrants or refugees who are here, I don’t believe immigrants will leave on their own accord because the worst day in Europe is still better than the best day where they came from – even if benefits are reduced or cut. They will settle and remain just as they have in the UK and France. Some will make a living for themselves as barbers, shop keepers, maybe mechanics (there are some with skills) while the majority will most likely turn to crime supported by extended families and move into slums and other locations where Germans won’t live if they have another choice.

                    Agree with you but remember that Hungary and Poland have never encouraged mass immigration, so I don’t know how they’re “reforming.” Denmark is another matter.

                “The West will get suddenly poorer in the next decade. This will change the math of immigration.”Yes, I find this eminently plausible. Until now the chasm between the living standards of Western Europe and North America (along with welfare state provisions, mostly in Europe) on the one hand and the rest of the world on the other, has been a draw for migration. When that divide between the West and the rest of the world becomes less pronounced — as it was a few centuries back — the impetus to migrate will dwindle. At the same time, when living standards in the West become closer to subsistence level, the hearts of even the most liberal will harden. Even in 1900 most Europeans were living at subsistence level.

        Ironically, Cicero was a reactionary defender of a republican system that was already rotted out by Roman imperialism and therefore an enemy the health of the people. A republic requires a large class of freeholders. Roman imperialism and the civil wars had created a large slave class and driven Italian freeholders off the land and into the cities. The land was increasingly in the hands of the wealthy who ran their latifundia with slave labor. Attempts to reform this system had been crushed by the Roman elite, which played into the hands of ambitious generals like Caesar. Our current situation is not unlike ancient Rome, with our own elite importing a serf class, claiming an ever greater share of wealth, hiding behind democratic rhetoric to justify their tyranny, and crushing attempts to derail the gravy train they have created for themselves. They seem to think Trump is a Caesar-like figure (they are wrong) and they would love to have him meet Caesar’s fate.

        I would add, that “our democracy” as the elites like to proclaim, is their vision of themselves as morally superior and more intelligent supreme technocrats controlling the lumpenproletariat towards “usefulness” which generally involves the extinction of said lumpenproletariat.This is why Fauci, a man redolent of failure, evoked such a response of religious ecstasy, particularly from Karens. Here, here was the man they had waited for. Credentialed. “He is the science!” Having authority of both position and holy sacred Academic degrees.“Our democracy’ is nothing more than unfettered, Aristocratic Rule by semi-hereditary “experts” with credentials and a bureaucratic position of authority. It is a very strange Aristocracy, which is why it gives most ordinary people the creeps. Like a moldy piece of fruit or rotten cut of meat, people instinctively know its wrong and off.A guy like Fauci is good with media support to use the power of the State against hairdressers, barbers, bartenders, and cafe owners. Those, he can crush easily. Against Houthis, Russians, Iranians, and the Chinese, not so much. Indeed the complete and total failure of the model of “our democracy” is seen by the Houthis, aided by Iran, completely shutting down the Suez Canal (with dire consequences for Egypt which is likely looking at an islamist revolution and thus war with Israel). The US Navy has completely failed to stop the Houthis/Iran. Which themselves are relatively shambolic regional powers with limitations of their own.Given that the Elite Ruling class depends on the State actually using and ensuring “American Defense” (per the old Monty Python skit) to make sure that their is not global chaos and shutting down sea lanes, etc. you can see the ickiness and revulsion people instinctively have for “our democracy.”Real power is not using the media and bureaucracy to crush the owner of a barbershop or cafe. That sort of think is like the late Kimbo Slice fighting bums off the street literally. Real power is marshaling industrial production on a massive scale, to have such a powerful military including a big, powerful navy, air force, and army that no foe or combination of foes would dare challenge your nation. That HAD been the function of US policy up until the Clintons, and the techno-priestly caste can only push aside the warrior caste so much until catastrophic defeats and collapse means the end of the system.

Why is it important to put the blame on the media owners instead of the state? Because we may only get one shot and it needs to be aimed at the head of the snake.

            This is the Greg Hood argument. I am sympathetic, but the thing is, the media exists because of the state. It is all access media now, where media members compete for access to people with power. If you are working the State department desk for the WaPo, your life depends on having and keeping friends in the State Department, who reward you with copy for your reports.That said, I would agree that the media compete with one another to amplify the current trends and often these trends originate outside of the state, but ultimately power lies with the state. If they do not like the trend, the media stops doing the bit.

                I agree that there is a back and forth between the media and the state and that, on paper, the state holds the ultimate power. But then, look at Trump’s term and judge the value of the words in the Constitution and laws.
Where do the ethics of anti-white and anti-tradition emanate? My best guess is that it is the owners of the media.
(On a recent podcast, Hood said that he didn’t originate the phrase. He guesses he picked it up from Mike Enoch, but isn’t sure.)

        I would argue that you are incorrect, insofar as the ruling elite in “our democracy” does NOT have the health of the people as their goal. Only some people, and very much not others.You are quite correct in that the State has taken over the Spiritual duties of the Church, but those spiritual duties are quite different. The Religion of the Elite is totally post-Christian, based on the absolute depravity and genetic evil of White people, the hereditary blood guilt of all Whites for everything bad particularly 1933-45, and the redemption of black and muslim peoples from Whiteness.THIS is their jihad. Their religious duty. One they express every day. It is why the West is overrun with non-White males of military age. Our rulers hate us and want us dead, for religious reasons.It is why the “flight from White” in first homosexuality, and now transgenderism, has taken place. “It is no longer enough” to be be gay, as one Hollywood insider put it, WHITE people must be transgender. The rulers holy duty, their religious beliefs, compel them to eradicate all Whites and White civilization. So that the Lennonist utopia of “Imagine” can come into being. Holding hands, drinking a Coke, celebrating no more White people or civilization ever.My guess is that there will be some coordinated line of attack should Trump win. Jailing him immediately with no Secret Service protection, to Epstein him. Abolishing by decree the Constitution as signaled in advance by the Times, various law profs, etc. We might even see Obama take direct rule, with all that implies (camps for YT, military rule, etc).I would even say Steve Sailer was more right than he knew, in that KKKrazy Glue is the only thing holding together elite coalitions: muslims, jews, blacks, hispanics, indians, gays, lesbians, transgenders, etc. And the more “diverse” members who really hate each other get added (example: muslims added to jews), the more HATE HATE HATE is required organically against Whites to keep the KKKrazy Glue fast. Hate for White people can only grow in Elite rulers, and that hate is now in the UK, soon here, to be put into direct action. No one should think voting will change that.

        How can a society be “healthy” if it’s infected with pathogenic parasites? It cannot. Either the antibodies arise or the body dies. The elites want to proactively direct these antibodies at healthy tissue (blue on blue) in a mutual slaughter that kills off all means of remedy. This is why they spin up the anger. They want the pitchfork mob to confront the police line in a fury of revenge, while they hide in dark bunkers. No! No! No! Bunkers first. LEOs and NGs must turn and march with us. It’ the only way to be sure.

        they will be judged at how well they perform their priestly roles and the reasonableness of their new religions edictsIt will depend on who writes the history. That normally is who wins. Grotesque sycophants such as Michael Beschloss and Jonathan Meachum had assumed it would fall to them to render the judgment but their object of desire was vanquished. Along these lines, the thuggish authoritarianism of the Wilson Administration was hidden until that no longer was possible (the revision was not because of the pogrom on German Americans, for example, but the race realism displayed toward blacks–quite fitting).We are told daily they perform their priestly roles superbly and their religious edicts are quite reasonable, but as you say reality is not the thing that goes away when you no longer believe it, and thus far it cannot be hidden, either. Memoryholing may be the only option.

        I enjoyed today’s post and subsequent discussion without the need to comment myself.  I do wish to say that your interview on Coffee and a Mike was great. That young man certainly punches above his weight class and has most of the heavy hitters from our side on his show. I would suggest that you keep your phone with you when wrestling heavy timber in the back 40.
