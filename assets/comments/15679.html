        Sorry guys but I just have to say this: if any of my male friends ever say ‚ÄòI am getting a new vagina next week‚Äô that had better mean that he intends to get laid next week. That was one really, unusually messed up story, even for an age where every kind of freak and pervert, and many new ones that no healthy brain could ever conceive of, seem to crawl out of every hole and even orifice. These ppl are not just sick, they are PROFOUNDLY perverse.

            Darn right! We should sue Z for our hurt feelings. All we need is a sleazy lawyer with no scruples or self respect! Wherever will we find one of those?
Great show as usual, both in the presentation and the comments! Keep up the good work boys!

        Love the blog, and have begun listening to the Podcasts.  (For a bout 2 months now).  One technical complaint:  the music is MUCH louder than the speaking.  This is jarring in the same way TV commercials being 800 times louder than the program itself is jarring.
I get the need to spruce the show up with some fun audio, but the YUGE volume increases are tough to slog through.
Keep up the great work.

        I‚Äôm a listener since the podcast started. I often skip past the xirl sciences section. Nothing personnal, I can understand the humour in it. I just find it a total black pill. You think of the humanities and its contribution to The West and Humanity in general. And then you hear that shit, and it feels like a kick in the stomach. The horrible thing is that it‚Äôs spreading like a malignant cancer from the Anglophone World to the rest of The West. It feels at times like we‚Äôre a civilization with a shotgun buried in it‚Äôs mouth with an itchy trigger finger. I‚Äôve a son 18 months old, sometimes my wife and I dread his future. But you see those young lads in the class photo doing a Roman salute and it makes you a bit more philosophical. If we survive, the way out is true. What we become at the end of it is open to interpretation. The Visigoths lost almost all of they‚Äôre home. The Spanish took it all back and drove the Orkish hordes back to the desert. I look forward to your moral philosophy Z. We need a new religion. No pressure üòâ

            It‚Äôs funny, but the people either love or hate the Xirl science stuff. People with college age kids really hate it. I‚Äôve had more than a few college professors write me to say they had no idea this lunacy was happening for real.

                I can confirm that the author of that ground-breaking scholarly masterpiece ‚Äú‚ÄòWe swam before we breathed or walked‚Äô: able-bodied belonging in popular stories of evolutionary biology‚Äù, Touko Vaahtera, is indeed xim:https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Touko_Vaahtera
Besides critical disability studies xi seems to be intrested in gender studies and feminist theory, and judging by the picture, probably consumes large quantities of soy, so it is understandable if xone mistakes xim for a xirl.

                Can‚Äôt believe I live in a time of mass insanity. Even the granddaughter in Oklahoma is a tyranny, from a girl to a boy. It‚Äôs in the air. It is like They Live. You never know if you‚Äôre talking to a dangerous creature.  I‚Äôm having a difficult time‚Ä¶. so hard to accept that this is part of the human nature to drift into civilisational insanity then collapse.  I sometimes daydream that we all woke up and discovered it was mass ergotism causing hallucinations and attendant irrational behaviour,‚Ä¶the little spores drifted around western civilisation. And then we all woke up.  But no.

            Shane, I am inclined to agree with you  because the laughter induced by the ridiculousness of xirl science is insufficient to dispel the bitter sorrow I feel at the degradation of the Humanities.  When I studied for my A.B. in rhetoric, I gloried in the wisdom of Aristotle, Quintillian, Erasmus, Castiglione and Mirandola.  I loathed the post-modernists and the corrosive influence of Derrrida and Foucault.  It was easy to see that even in the mid 80s the academy was tainted beyond reformation; so I and most of my peers found ourselves studying law with varying degrees of reluctance or enthusiasm.  One thing that never occurred to me at the time, or anyone else that ever admitted as much, was the utter lack of any serious female paradigm of rhetorical practice or theory.  Plenty of women professors in the academy, but no remarkable female master (mistress?) in all of Western history.  No doubt the feminists have retconned the field to find a few since the Enlightenment; but I‚Äôd wager those would be mostly xirl rhetors as risible as the others in Zman‚Äôs xirl science hall of shame.

        Re: Hitler‚Äôs Revenge, why assume that Stephen Miller is unique? As for whiteness, a high-pedigree WASP would find little to distinguish between a Pole, an Italian and a European Jew.  As to religion, there‚Äôs little to distinguish a WASP (usually a godless Episcopalian) from a reform Jew. As to voting patterns, white ethnics in blue counties all vote the same. The Jews are no exception. Lots of people are wrong on the immigration issue. I‚Äôd prefer not to make enemies of potential friends. The Jews shouldn‚Äôt be faulted for permitting themselves to be used for an eschatological experiment by the most fervent Christians in our midst.

Picked up the new Camry lunchtime yesterday. Hit a deer at 6:16 this morning. It‚Äôs totaled. Did less than 30 miles in it . Deer had to be shot. If anyone wants it there‚Äôs a couple hundred pounds of nice venison on the Hampstead to Mexico road in Carroll County MD.

I can abide bad x-rated talk from someone sexy, but this just would not do. Unfortunately, Ralph was much less understanding than Dave.

I am probably going to regret admitting this, but I gave him head because it just seemed like the easiest and quickest way out of the situation. The whole time, he talked about my cheerleading uniform and Catholic school jumpers.Afterwards, he gave me $300 and asked when he could see me again. I told him I would be out of town for the next two weeks (true) and would get in touch when I got back.

        Thought experiment: take a five minute break, have a cup of very good coffee, then sit down and actually read the original text of the Declaration of Independence.  Read it with a clear head, as a serious text, not as a series of exciting rhetorical flourishes (which it also is), but as a text reflecting the sober, serious-minded judgement of well-educated and reflective men: men who had looked about them, surveyed the landscape, and drawn the necessary conclusions.You have to make a few minor contextual adjustments: for ‚Äúthe King of Great Britain‚Äù you should read ‚ÄúHawaiian Federal Judge‚Äù and/or ‚ÄúGoldman Sachs‚Äù; for ‚Äúthe merciless Indian savages‚Äù you should read ‚Äúthe dindus‚Äù; and for ‚Äúswarms of officers‚Ä¶ who eat out our substance‚Äù you should read ‚ÄúH1-Bs, student visas and  Squatemalans.‚Äù  Otherwise, with a few other key-changes, it scans pretty clear.Pay particular attention to your own hermeneutic take on what exactly is meant by words like ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù and ‚Äúours.‚ÄùSoooo‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ whaddaya think?

            It would have been more accurate for Jefferson to have written, ‚ÄúWe are your equals‚Äù rather than the universalist sentence he wrote. However, doing so would have been even more confrontational. He went for the universal rather than the particular as a way of appealing to natural law, which would have some domestic appeal in Britain, hoping to raise up a little bit of antiwar sentiment there.

        It‚Äôs true what you are saying about the sex change surgeons, that they are making false promises to mentally ill people.  Not all medicine is benevolent of course, and there is a significant business component.  The snake oil salesmen are still with us.  You see a similar phenomenon with the neonatal surgeons who are ‚Äúsaving‚Äù ridiculously premature, brain dead crack babies for we the tax payers to support(in some cases.)  neonatal surgery and organ transplant(who do great work btw) are the two most expensive branches of medicine.these transsexuals are low iq people or delusional who really believe, are deceived that, that they will become women in all respects, which we realize is physically impossible.  The surgeons play to their deep, delusional desires, and then the patients/victims discover that they are not true females, but rather born on the forth of July men with their Phalluses chopped off.  A ridiculously high percentage commit suicide.What we need is psychiatrists who suffer with the same mental defect to develop treatment and coping mechanisms that will help these people, who are after all a microscopic minority of humanity.

            Long ago I met my friend‚Äôs-parent‚Äôs-friends, a nice couple from the north shore of Long Island (Plandome Manor actually; a rather upscale area). The wife was a blonde British woman, the husband was a verrry genteel British-raised Pakistani. He was a urologist of the highest caliber, worked at the most prestigious hospital around .. North Shore University Hospital. They also had two beautiful well-mannered mixed race children. Belonged to the Lutheran church. Lovely people.You would never suspect that his main work was chopping dicks off.Ah, Dr. Hashmid. Also authored a great textbook ‚ÄúThe Penis‚Äù.

            NRO closed their comments because they could not take the criticism. I was a regular commenter there and I know the NR writers loathed me. In fact, at various times Rich Lowry, Kevin Williamson, Charlie Cooke and some other guy I forget called me ‚Äúloathsome.‚Äù John Podhoretz looked up my e-mail and sent me a note telling me how much he detested me. That said, the reason they had traffic was the comment section. Once they closed it down, their traffic collapsed.Taki is a curious case. I suspect that Jim Goad just closed it out of spite. He‚Äôs one of those middle aged guys whose politics have curdled into a general sourness. It happens.

                        Ya know, there has been a general quelling of comment threads of late, and now that you mention it, (shock scream) antisemitism seems to be the uniting theme.  Seems like just a year ago I was reading lengthy, sometimes fascinating comment threads at occidental observer and related sites, and now only a paltry few nutty sounding comments appear, and they update the comments maybe once every couple days.  Do you think there could be some sort of trump justice department led crack down on anti Semitic and anti Israel forums?  Similar to what‚Äôs happening to the proud boys, etc?

        On the subject of the libertarians, I do wonder if they appear to have run out of steam due to the fact that they have pretty much achieved their goals? With the benefit of some distance, I believe that the entire ‚Äúfree market‚Äù movement was nothing but a foot-stamping demand for lots of yummy stuff to eat and endless toys to play with. I think there is at least an arguable case that the libertarian movement was really nothing more than a rationalisation for the cupidinous appetites of 12 year-old boys who just wanted to be left alone with all their stuff.And that‚Äôs pretty much what they‚Äôve got now; tasty treats, toys, games, interwebs, pr0n are all on tap and inexpensive. Why bother continuing the fight when there is nothing else they ever really wanted to fight for? They‚Äôve arrived at the end of their rainbow. Job done.

                I so enjoyed working with mostly men in water treatment and distribution.  Two engineers, two sr. treatment operators, an instrument tech, and a maintenance mechanic where standing next to me as I ran the system discussing the construction of the new chlorine injection system when their brains flipped in a nanosecond and I heard, ‚ÄúBut if she had Susan‚Äôs legs‚Ä¶don‚Äôt forget Nadine‚Äôs tits..well add Michelle‚Äôs gorgeous face‚Ä¶.how about Karen‚Äôs ass‚Äù all in 15 seconds the perfect woman then right back to construction planning.  Didn‚Äôt say a peep and lightly smiled as delightfully amusing and glad I could witness the inner sanctum! Guess I was accepted! It was nice to step back and savour the difference.

As a depressing side-note, the guy who plays Stan, Eric Idle, is a boring, typical shitlib in interviews.

            John Cheese is rabidly anti-Trump, recently  making disparaging remarks about him. I guess, as much as I enjoyed Monty Python, they have turned into limousine liberals and thus must be ignored.Speaking of our cousins across the pond, the last few posts have featured comments from some Brit‚Äôs previously unheard. I,  for one, enjoy reading these and get a kick out of their slightly ‚Äútilted‚Äù point of view. It is very enlightening to hear what the rest of the civilized world thinks about us in ‚Äúthe colonies‚Äù. Bear in mind, cousins, that the only perspective the average American gets about your opinions of us is heavily filtered thru the Globohomo-Trump-is-the-devil media.

                Please, please, please don‚Äôt assume that manufactured pablum you read in the British press is either (a) true or (b) representative of ordinary Brits. Our MSM is as bad as yours and maybe worse; a 24/7 poz-machine. Our culture is similarly entirely in enemy hands.When DJT came to the UK the media was turned over to blanket coverage of the anti-Trump marches. The following day there were massive pro-Trump rallies all over Britain. Media blackout.Our TV ‚Äúdebates‚Äù are hilarious. 4 globohomo diversitoids and one quivering, sweating, babbling cuckservative for ‚Äúbalance‚Äù.Anyway, trust me when I tell you that Trump has a massive wellspring of support in this country. We are an army in the dark.

        The Globe ?  Do they still print that fish wrap ?  Can remember growing up in Dorchester, white, safe, everybody knew their neighbors.
But the black horde kept marching up Dorchester Avenue. We moved several times finally making it over the bridge into South Boston. Held the line for many years but the feds wouldn‚Äôt have it.
Now the place is overrun with yuppies and their little pets. My hometown is gone. It only lives on in memories.

        The only people threatened by confident experienced women are loser incels.
Mia love is exactly RIGHT. How come non-whites and white women feel the same way about things and white men are the only outliers.
That tells you something right there.

            ‚ÄúWestern man towers over the rest of the world in ways so large as to be almost inexpressible. It‚Äôs Western exploration, science, and conquest that have revealed the world to itself.Other races feel like subjects of Western power long after colonialism, imperialism, and slavery have disappeared.The charge of racism puzzles whites who feel not hostility, but only baffled good will, because they don‚Äôt grasp what it really means: humiliation.The white man presents an image of superiority even when he isn‚Äôt conscious of it.And, superiority excites envy.Destroying white civilization is the inmost desire of the league of designated victims we call minorities.‚ÄùJoseph Sobran, April 1997Anything else you need to know?
