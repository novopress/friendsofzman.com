        First Indian to serve as PM of the UK tells his staff he has no interest in attending the D-Day ceremonies, no interest in “the past,” is reluctantly dragged to Normandy and leaves an hour later for a teevee interview back in London.
Magic soil, folks! They’re just like us!

            The longer they keep performing them, the more tedious and hollow become the homages to the GAE’s foundational stories. It is particularly curious to see the “left” transform into the greatest champions of GAE militarism, as they equate all resistance to the GAE’s vision with the foundational Satan from Austria. I can remember when they styled themselves too sophisticated to be real enthusiastic about such jingoism. Doesn’t seem that long ago.Tom Hanks D-Day Warning: ‘Don’t Let That Happen Again’ (msn.com)

            Well, that really gets to the heart of it, doesn’t it? How could the wogs possibly be like us when they share none of our culture and customs and very little of our history? They cannot. They have no sympathy with our past, only antipathy. The fact that anybody was stupid enough to believe multiculti could possibly work beggars belief.

                Not for me.  I grew up in NYC.  Multiculturalism was as common as pizzerias.  However, it was predominantly White—and where it wasn’t, it was in segregated neighborhood’s.  Whites, of the non-mutant form, controlled the political structure.  Massive immigration and therefore demographic imbalance was limited via quotas.  Given those parameters, multiculturalism did work—or at least was tolerable.
However, we did not have the understanding of “why” it worked.  The theorists came up with explanations such as what we derisively the “magic dirt theory”—anything but White majority coupled with segregation.

                    Well, let me rephrase. It cannot work over the long haul because the political will to suppress and segregate will inevitably weaken and vanish. All hell will then break loose, and there will be no putting the multiculti djinn back in the bottle. That is where we are now in the western world.

                        Djinn reference: The 1997 SF/horror movieWishmaster(and maybe sequel) show the perils of getting what one wishes for. Without giving too much away, perhaps it’s best to not wish for anything. Yet all is made well by one clever victim hitting upon the perfect wish. In the movie universe, the Djinn was imprisoned in a gem rather than a bottle, although “the bottle” in the common usage (e.g. what you’re currently holding in your hand) does figure in the story’s plot. Yeah, they’re probably bombs, but Z might review them if business is slow.

        Prediction:Merchan will jail Trump*, full stop, and the GOP will try to substitute a nominee. Biden will step aside due to “health concerns.” “See, it’s all fair–both are removed! Go back to your grilling, comrades!”It is just retarded enough to be tried.Support for the Regime will continue to collapse, states will grow more and more independent, and the Republican Party will die nationally even though the Regime will try to prop it up. Look for a false flag or even troops deployed to Europe to face off against Russia, and a surprising number of people realizing they are being gaslit in the same way they light their grills. The Regime will rule by raw force from this point until the GAE falls apart, and while it still likely will be some time out the collapse also could be sudden.The 800 lb. gorilla in the room is the economy, as you suggested, and it may tank this fall.*Not only is Merchan a lunatic, he’s under the same peer pressure–potentially fatal–as the jurors were.

            He’s not a lunatic, he’s been promised something for notching all the trees to fall in the regimes direction. If biden stays, again, look for merchan to wind up on a federal bench. If biden goes, look for merchan to high-tail it back to whatever third-world shithole that spawned him, never to be heard from again.

This guy was drafted decades ago, trained, and kept on reserve. They have hundreds like him. That is why he is an “acting judge.” They won’t sully their system by giving their hitmen their own royal titles.
Merchan was given all three of Trump’s NYC cases. The odds of that are the same as rolling the same number on a six-sided die five times in a row.
Ordinary people will not accept that they are in the grips of evil.

                I feel there will be some ‘two weeks’ aspect of this because the democrats want to meme. So, maybe they will lock him up for two weeks? I don’t know, but they are desperate to meme and think meme’ing is not serious, it’s just fun and games.

                Very true. But they can’t kneecap him quite as well as they used to be able to do. He will trust his first instincts more than he used to and he won’t be so willing to compromise on things he knows aren’t right.

As an aside – is Merchan a Happy Merchan? Wikipedia’s Early Life section doesn’t mention it, but it has been gutted recently.

                Re: Briggs
I had not considered the leftwing violence angle. The only reason this hasn’t spun into a full blown civil war is because times are relatively good and, most importantly, the non-Left has not responded in kind. Once the economic incentives not to respond disappear, it is on. I wouldn’t count on leftwing violence being answered without an economic collapse.

                    Few years ago, around the 2020 election, I used to have a nice old lady neighbor. She was a leftie, living alone with her chihuahua and every time we met on the street she rambled about the coming civil war. She seemed fired up about it.

                    Leftwing violence is, for the present, more or less confined to feral negroes and soy-fed underweight white punks who’d shit their pants at the sight of a serious, no-shit adversary. But that is changing rapidly, given the deliberate deployment of hundreds of thousands of lean, male “newcomers” across the fruited plain. Our ruling junta knows what it’s doing. The only hope we – the conquered – have for liberation, is widespread economic collapse. Such a collapse means a free-for-all, and we still have the numbers…

                        I see a lot of young imported males all over Europe. I travel a lot across many EU countries, often to relatively remote places. The invaders are everywhere. It used to be that they were only in big cities. Now I see them in small villages, even in poorer EU countries. It all happened in less than one year. Many of them are Indians. They did not come by foot, but were rather imported by the EU governments after agreements with India, Bangladesh and other south-Asian countries.All that being said, the point I actually wanted to make was different. I do not believe that they are brought in to fight locals. They are brought in to compete with the local males for women. Of course, most women don’t want them, but a few will want them and many will be raped and coerced. That is the actual plan of our demonic masters. They love race-mixing and they want to see as much of it as possible, by any means.

            Lawfare:
Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska (R) (very powerful) was convicted by a jury in 2008. Barak Obama and John McCain immediately weighed in and said he should resign.
He went on to run anyway and lost by 1.3%.
A year later a whistleblower in the FBI leaked enough info to prove that the FBI had hid evidence during his trial. The verdict was voided, but by then it was too late.
He then died in an airplane crash less than a year later..so no running again.
So yeah, there’s some precedence for all this.

        The obstinate refusal of Americans to simply swallow the narrative and abandon Trump is definitely worth noting.  When announcing his candidacy for Parliament this week, Nigel Farage mentioned, “I promise you, something is happening out there.  I’ve been in this game 30 years.  I’ve fought lots of elections.  I’ve generally got a pretty good sense of timing.  Something is happening out there.”

            Why would they have a Plan B? They’ve been winning without much effort from the 1960’s on and arguably from 1900 on.
The plan is to win, just like their fathers and grandfathers before them.
That they might have made the US such a degenerate place that we’ve all been desensitized to felonies anyway, let alone obviously fake trials does not compute. We’re supposed upset that Trump is now a “felon” somehow, when tomorrow the “wrongly convicted” felon joggers will need sympathy.

                    What does “winning” look like? Much as you hate to think about ideology, you have to have both a vision of where you want to be, and an idea of the means to get there. And, someone added last time, means consistent with human nature.
White supremacy has no chance of being adopted — way too many whites actively oppose it. Even white separatism has less support than “school choice.”
Given that utopia is not an option, how can we make the lives and our progeny better? What can be done that is more effective than nodding or grilling?

                            Personally, I think white supremacy is just a fact. Not only do whites produce a superior culture / society, non-whites want a piece of it as an entitlement. It’s just that there are way too many whites who feel guilty for their superiority that even they have to subconsciously admit. I do not believe they are reachable. And the SMs are a step beyond that — if not everyone can have it, none can.
But a society overtly based on that, in today’s world? Utopia.

                                Well, let’s just call a spade a spade–so to speak–then, and call it white superiority rather than white supremacy, which strikes me as a weasel phrase. What’s more, it sows confusion because supremacy, to my mind, strongly implies the right to rule. One can believe in white superiority without believing that gives whites the right to rule over other peoples.

                                        That’s not what I mean. Of course we have a right to rule a white country, but we don’t have the right to rule Angola or to import Angolans into Whiteland and rule over them. As far as white rule in AINO goes, that’s clearly a non-starter. In point of fact, we never should have allowed non-whites into the country, in which case this wouldn’t even be an issue.

                            Supremacy is the view, held by every race on the planet in varying degrees, that our particular group’s skills, culture, and preference are the bestest.Our open borders society is built on the premise. We apparently are such masters of the universe that we can improve people by simply living near them. We’re helping! No amount of people is too many! Everyone can be an American and should want to be! Thus the endless drum beat of blacks/asians who take up white habits and culture in advertisements and such.Our overlords really do believe in magic soil and the general supremacy of whites.

We try to get kids established in businesses, but it seems everyone else is either not doing it, or, at best, doing it for their firstborn, and all other whites can just go screw.
If DR isn’t doing anything to advance our interests, it’s little different than a debating and grilling club.

                        We tried open white supremacy in the early 20th century. It resulted on white nationalism on steroids. From a certain POV, the cucked society you see around is also the result of white supremacy but with inverted values. (We’re so awesome, we don’t even have to reproduce!)
I do have a clear vision of better and winning, but I suspect most here and in the modern world would not like the vision.

                            That wasn’t the American experience, though. We had that spat about states rights and secession, so at least the losers there weren’t ultra-nationalists, and even the victors had no qualms about keeping non-whites (and even some whites) in their place.
It wasn’t until America had to have its Precious, (socialism) andright now, dammit, that the nationalist character started flourishing.

                    We’re in a social decay. Winning/improvement involves a whole lot of discipline that nobody wants to exercise anymore. Modern conservative political movements only are deploying brakes against a liberalism they largely agree with. It would take a reactionary to really have a vision.
For example, are we interested in shaming people who live together again? That would help, believe it or not. As would the reinstitution of any number of “backward” social rules. But that’s not exactly popular.

                        Exactly. When I’m thinking actions that might lead towards something better for my grandkids, I’m excluding things like rainbow unicorns rampaging through South Chicago.
While what we are doing here in my community isn’t much, I’d like to think it makes a difference in a few peoples’ lives. Ultimately, though, it’s mostly a futile delaying tactic. Without fresh ideas about how to advance at least the best of our people, we lose.

                            Your comment strikes a cord.  Perhaps we’ve had our “time in the sun” and failed.  Time to “pass the baton” to the next generation.  To do so entails supporting/encouraging them in any future effort to survive and prosper in a White and hopefully sane enclave that they can carve out in what’s left of AINO.For example, what’s a dollar worth today as to what it will be worth 20 years from now?  If you wait until you die to leave it to children/grandchildren, what have you left of value?  A bad day for the markets is coming soon.  Cash will be king.  Would a gift of money to secure a reasonable plot of land somewhere of minimal “diversity” be your greatest investment in your DNA?  There are other examples, some we’ve used today, like tuition for private schooling, and so forth.

            It has happened too many times in the past for it to be a coincidence- Formerly Great Britain has presaged huge shifts in the American political scene in the last decade. The stunning result of the Brexit referendum presaged the same unexpected election of the BOM. Then the reaction by the elites to destroy the results of those democratic solutions by any means necessary, “legal” and extralegal, along with shrill propaganda. Now it appears that Britain, in the Zero Seats campaign, will utterly destroy the Vichy Party of the current Pajeet PM. That certainly presages repudiating the current American regime led by Chomo Joe and his merry band of mutants, and possibly the far overdue and unlamented death of America’s Vichy party in the Republicans if they attempt to block the BOM.Nigel is right.

                    Look at the monthly BLS jobs report – it’s been totally fake and has been for years now. The report they put out yesterday is especially ridiculous. If/when Orange Man Bad gets into the Oval Office, they will just start telling the truth. They’ll put out an incredibly brutal report in February 2025, a few weeks into his term, and put him on his heels right away. There won’t be any time for him to fix anything.
Remember, they engineered a color revolution to get the guy out in 2020, there is nothing they won’t do.

                Look at the evolution of Mount St. Helens in 1980, which probably unfolded the same way many volcanic eruptions do.  In March, there was an initial eruption, not too big, that put it on everyone’s radar.  Then for two months it alternated between quiescence and tremors.  In May a large bulge was observed growing on the side of it and the tremors picked up their pace.  Finally, on May 18 half the mountain fell off and devastated the area.I just wonder if we’re not in a similar pattern with our politics?  Did the drivers of 2015-2016 actually go away, or have their gone underground and built up pressure?

        If there’s one certainty in all this it’s that the GOP will findsomewayto fink on their voters.  It’s arguably the only reason the regime allows the party to exist at this point.I suspect a big part of the reason for the silence of the cucks in the aftermath of the Trump verdict is that they saw how much money he was raising and they’re determined to grift a part of that for themselves.  I’m sure part of the regime plan however involves commissioning a bunch of phony polls that will say something to the effect that “68% of the American people are uncomfortable will a felon running for President” and the GOP will then use that as an excuse to remove him – especially if he’s in prison during the convention.I’m still quite fearful that one of the summer surprises in store is NATO boots on the ground in the Ukraine.  The people in charge wouldn’t hesitate in the slightest to start WWIII if they thought it would further cement them in charge.  I’m sure that one of the narratives they believe is that people would “rally ’round the flag” and support the regime if American troops were in the field.

            Yes. The old “Rally around the Flag”  con.   They do live in the past don’t they.   The elite will soon discover that rally around the flag isn’t a thing anymore.
I still feel sympathy for veterans who have been fooled in the past.   I have no such sympathy for people in the military today.  They should understand by now who they are working for.

                    The relative obsession with D-Day belongs to the Boomers/older Gen X and it will die with them. The WWII generation I remember mostly wanted to put WWII in closet somewhere and to go to Florida in the winter.

The only thing that really stuck out about D-Day was the complexity of it.

Putting boots in the Kraine will take time. If those idiots try, Vlad will flatten Kiev, send his forces flooding west, and start menacing NATO assets from the Polish border. That, and he’ll start dealing out long range weapons to all America’s enemies around the world.

                Vlad is smarter than that. He would probably keep the obvious stuff for the obviously valid military targets. KEEEEEEVVV, sure. Staging ground and airfields in eastern Poland, maybe, certainly if those troop muster into Ukraine.
But long range missiles? Why? Hack the EBT system and Chicago goes up in flames. The idiots in government have already pre-placed the diverse forces that will take them out.  And as much as they’ve cried wolf, who is going to believe it was Russia?

                    I’ve already seen articles in MSM (no links tho, sorry) that hint that Russian operatives are already engaging in sabotage and espionage in EU and USA. Russia pre-emptively disrupting a potential adversary or simply NATO propaganda, either or both could be true. Or less dramatically, perhaps the occasional factory fire, derailed trains or ship taking out important bridges could be merely coincidences.

                    No, therainbow flagsymbolizes all that. You can burn the Stars &amp; Stripes and be hailed as a “free thinker”. Go ahead and burn the real imperial flag – the rainbow flag – and just see what happens.
Anal love is among those cherished freedoms that our “men and women in uniform” stand tall to protect in places like Japan, Oman, Korea, Italy, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, etc. Our aged B-52s still fly at the ready to annihilate – if need be – the enemies of buttlove, cross-dressing and pedophilia.

                        Ask Daniel Rosemark, he’ll tell you all about it.  From an AP article:
“Daniel Rosemark was sentenced last month to the 361 days he had already served while being held on charges in the case…… Police said that in November 2019, Rosemark torn down a rainbow pride flag that had been outside The Blazing Saddle in the East Village. Rosemark told officers he did it because he was angry that the gay community had adopted adopted the rainbow as a symbol of pride.”
You mess with the rainbow flag and you’ll get got with the rainbow dildo.

                I suspect that’s probably true, and goes way beyond the President. I doubt one would  be allowed to gain national stature in politics without being compromised. So long as you play ball, all that dirty laundry stays in the hamper.

            More importantly, all legislative bills attempting to fix election/ballot “holes” have been veto’d by our Dem Governor.  Now the latest round is in the courts attempting to get the voter registration rolls reviewed and reduced to only legitimate voters—this is Federal law!.  Several AZ Counties have more registered voters than eligible residents!  Our two biggest Counties have voter registration of 98% of the theoretical eligible voters—a number unheard of when compared to other Counties in the country, where 69% is average.I still say why vote when the system is corrupt?  I heard Trump yesterday speaking in Phx and he is now of the “beat the cheat” ilk when telling supporters to vote in record turnout numbers.  He says they can’t cheat “that much”, we shall see.

        It is now blatantly obvious that the pace of the crazy is accelerating. A former president has been convicted of a fake crime and is being driven out of the campaign. We have a raging $35 trillion national debt that cannot be repaid. We have illegally imported 30 million sociopathic young males who are now just hanging around waiting for a chance wreak havoc upon us. This is all unprecedented. And we are being distracted by a corrupted election process to obscure the realty of our precarious situation. If you’re not now prepared to fight for the future, please off yourself and at least not be a useless mouth to feed.

        I start with the premise that ex presidents aren’t prosecuted for “felonies” without their being some kind of plan in place, that it is not some random DA acting independently, who would be shut down by people farther up the food chain were it unapproved. Unlike Nathan Wade, at least Alvin Bragg was smart enough not to log and bill his meetings with White House counsel.Then I look at the timing. The very next week after the Orange Man is convicted, the sitting president’s son begins his own felony trial. What an incredible coincidence! Which is expected to conclude in a week or 2, which will soon be followed by BOM’s sentencing, which will be immediately followed by the GOP convention.As I posted the other day in a reply to Whiskey, after Hunter is found guilty (why else is he being tried? and why now?), the narrative will be set that the justice system is fair. Even the president’s son is not above it! Then it is open season for draconian punishment of Trump by this proven fair justice system. Which provides the GOP with their excuse to nominate someone else. By the time Hunter is sentenced, his punishment will be lost in the news cycle, and if it’s light, will receive little attention aside from the usual charges of leftist hypocrisy by the usual “conservative” pundits, Trump and his fate being old news by that time, probably overtaken by other large world events of significant import.

We are talking about the very same people who concocted the Russia Hoax and kept it atop the news cycle for 2 years. Their media reach, staying power, mendacity, will, and the comprehensive and complex nature of their plans should not be underestimated.

                    It shouldn’t be overestimated, either. Every Con Man has one last con. The propaganda organs and their organ grinders blew their wad with the Russia Hoax, Covid, the open border and the stolen election. It looks like they very well may remove much of the vestigial traces of credibility with Ukraine this summer.

            I’m not sure that would wash, even with the nincompoops, numbskulls and knuckleheads who make up the majority of AINO’s populace. I mean, really. Can there be any meaningful comparison between a decadent, ne’er do well son of a lame duck president and the once and future president of AINO? Jailing Crackpipe Biden is utterly meaningless. Jailing Trump, OTOH, is justification for war. CP Biden is a filthy lamb the Power Structure can easily afford to sacrifice. BoM is probably the most important person on the planet.

                So far, all I’ve seen Hunter Biden charged with are Fed crimes. Biden will pardon him and has the authority to do so.  Given an excuse of “drug addled” impairment, it won’t sound as bad either.

        I dunno if that is one of the best or worst shows you ever did, Z. I may have to actually listen to it again because it does make you think. This is not a show of idle prattle to pass the time on the lawn mower and chores.one thing that leaps out at me: it seems to be a (valid) cornerstone of dissident thought: the political class are merely paid actors for the money men and donors. But here you speak in many cases where they are calling the shots and making the decisions. So which is it? Cue the “Who’s on first?” routine.Not trying to be a dink; I think this gets to the root of the problem with America today: nobody is in charge. Nobody will take ownership of the problems or propose meaningful ways to deal with them.The other brewing question is how much longer Americans stay engaged and play ball with the fragmenting team in charge. How do you deal with a crazy or corrupt New York judge blatantly engaging in election interference? If you are a disgruntled redneck from flyover country, or a dirt person that list everything during the Covid scam or someone who’s just had enough… it’s mighty tempting just to throw bombs at these guys and get the fight over with… or fire up the killdozer…Without leaders herds can do anything. I think the Great American Stampede is about to begin…But whadda I know?

When no one is in charge everyone is in charge, to adjust a great line from Dostoevsky. The most powerful faction at the moment is hard to discern, at it likely shifts constantly.

                That was one of the main points of the awful Netflix movie the Obamas put their names on called “Leave the World Behind.”  There is no one in charge and no master plan being executed behind the scenes.  Elites are mostly reacting to events like the way they followed the herd on Covid and trying to placate BLM rioters.  Every so often, one grows a spine and decides he is sick of a trend and pushes back.  Usually this ends up like the DEI rebranding that is happening now, where they realize their terminology is unpopular so they try to do the same thing under a different name.

                Everyone with proper authority is running his/her/zer own show.  The department heads of the DOD, State, Justice etc… are perfectly happy to have Joey Diapers shuffling around ineffectively.  It allows them to each do whatever they want in their sphere of authority.Some folks insist the Obama’s are running things.  That’s silly.  First of all Obama is lazy and Moochelle doesn’t care about anything but bitching.  But even if they were to try to tell Blinken or Myjerkass what to do, Blink and Myjorkas etc. would tell them “F*ck off;  Who elected you?  You have no authority, I am running things here and I don’t work for you.”When my boss isn’t telling me what to do, I do what I want and run things the way I want to.  The difference is I am not trying to drive the company into the ground or enrich myself, and I am conscientous so it works to the favor of my boss and the company.

            There are people in charge all right, just not who you may think. They don’t want anyone to look to closely at that the façade in Washington.
There are lackeys, Kompromat victims, starry-eyed Wokesters and other fringe-istas all committed to some vague notion of a new America. Those notions do not stand up to scrutiny, and all tend to favor the delusions of those wanna-be insiders. They are wreckers, even if they don’t recognize the concept or their assigned roles in the destruction of institutions and the country.

That’s just it. Obviously someone, or some cabal of someones, rules. The chaos we are living through has a kind of unity to it, suggesting intention and planning. When not a single government policy or initiative fails to defy common sense, when all the hallmarks of a healthy society are trampled one institution after another, and all the propaganda organs trumpet perversion 24/7, a normal sane person can only conclude that it’s all deliberate, that behind it all is an “intelligent design”, a hidden hand.

            Without leaders, most people won’t throw bombs they will just quit. Quit in whatever way they can to stop helping a society that treats them like shit and thinks it doesn’t matter because they have all the power. But do they?

                    Normie conservatives… so, I work with two guys in their sixties who are (almost) literally glued to their portable radios from sunup to sundown, listening to talk radio. They drive me nuts, for several reasons: (1) it doesn’t occur to them that I don’t necessarily want to listen to the same stuff, certainly not every day; (2) they think that in some way they are “in the fight” by listening to 3 hours of Glenn Beck, 3 hours of Clay &amp; Buck, 3 hours of Dan Bongino, and after dinner maybe an hour or two of Mark Levin… well, shit, ok, skip mowing your lawn and tending to your investments, take up arms and fight… but no, the fight ends up as buying their latest books or subscribing to their web TV. That’ll show the libs!*They are actually quite pathetic. Once in awhile I try to break through to them, like for example pointing out that without the talk radio, I wouldn’t know Rachel Maddow from Rachel Carson, or have to hear her inane babble. Larger point being, if all you have is hour after hour of “owning the Left” between ads for pillows, gold, and pain meds, then you really have nothing. You want it to be 1985 forever.*One of these guys owns every Mark Levin and Bill O’Reilly book ever written. ConInc does very well by him. He should get a ribbon or a free drink package on one of their cruises.

                Agree – riots and protests can be put down if wanted (see the recent pro-pali events).  But quiet quitting?  No real way to counter that.  It is not as flashy, has no focal point and its effects are not as immediate – but it is lethally effective (see former USSR).

        Most of us here have known that 2024 would be a wild year for this staggering wounded monster we call the USA. So far, we have watched a former president convicted in criminal court, massive pro-Palestinian demonstrations on prestigious campuses, hints of open war against Russia, millions of “newcomers” pouring into our country without vetting and immediately granted benefits and privileges closed to actual citizens, ongoing chatter about a war with China over the Taiwanese question, burgeoning inflation, disaster and malfeasance in Ukraine… and yet, for all this, things are strangely quiet, The big surprises are still to hatch. Our rulers can’t let us alone at a time like now. Riots, rumors of war, urban violence, a lethal new disease, a spike in white supremacist terror, climate perturbations… something. 2024 has been a slow-burning catastrophe, but it feels as though the “prestige” hasn’t been revealed.

As I like to note, compare early June 2024 to the same point in 2020.
Thankfully, we don’t have anything presently close to the mass terror ops we saw in 2020.
Yes, they are trying to start a new health scare, but that has failed to take root in the public consciousness for a variety of reasons.

        Did anyone have this weird sort of “what is this really about” vibe that z talks about, in late 2019 and early 2020 when they were impeaching trump.
It seemed, like clockwork, that covid happened almost as soon as the impeachment ended in acquittal. My suspicion that this was no coincidence has never been shaken.
Someone needs to foia all the emails from that time. What happened specifically on March 10-11 of 2020 to cause the left/media to do a 180/about-face on covid. Some marching order got sent out.

        Ipreviously predictedthat globohomo would lock up Trump to smash the symbol of defiant white middle America.That said, there are also a rising number of signs that the establishment may allow Trump to win in 2024 and govern as a sick facsimile of himself, a kind of skinsuited Jeb Bush type, or to crash the economy around him and blame him for the failure of the existing system.  These signs include:1: Trump’s other trials have been pushed out past the election instead of cascading.2: Trump caved entirely on the fraud $95 billion Ukraine/Israel/Taiwan “aid” bill, suggesting a backroom deal may have been worked out.3: Within the “aid” bill was a provision triggering automatic impeachment if Trump tries to pull out of Ukraine.4: Dementia Joe passed regulations that will make it essentially impossible to fire any of the globohomo civil service workers in DC.5: Trump said that neocon never-Trumper Nikki Haley would play a role in his administration.It’s important to remember:all these globohomo unelected, unfireable civil service hyenas/parasites do is plot.So whether they want Dementia Joe or Trump to win, they want all their bases covered this time around (unlike in 2016 where they were caught flat-footed given Hillary was so far ahead in every poll).

            I think the bit about letting Haley play in the sandbox is just hot air to try and woo some of her supporters and make them think they have a seat at the table.As for the new rule prohibiting anyone from firing the collection of freaks, if it’s an executive order, it can be undone just as easily as it passed.

I recall a certain executive order signed by The Precious to count illegal aliens in the census. Trump cancelled it, was sued, and John Roberts said he couldn’t. Because racism.

                    Thank you for reminding me of that. That douchebag should be retired and replaced with an Alito-type.One other thing I forgot to mention was the backing off of the prosecution of the other two cases. I think this was done after TPTB saw the haul of cash that Trump took in after that sham verdict in NY and thought “Holy shit! We do this again before the election, we might put him up over the billion dollar mark!”As Z mentioned in the podcast, the cucks got very quiet after the verdict and all of that money that Trump raked in, that’s my guess.

                Unfortunately it can’t be undone easily — Obama passed an executive order for DACA, Trump rescinded it but globohomo judges put out an executive order preventing it from being effectuated.  Such would happen again with this EO.

                    The delicious irony wrt DACA is that these million or so recipients—who have for the most part already assimilated into the population—are argued about incessantly and to the neglect of the elephant in the room, unenforced illegal immigrant deportation.
While we argued over peanuts, perhaps 30M+ have entered—almost all as adults who have little chance of assimilation or education to US norms.

                        I believe the judge in this matter was not deciding per se on one executive order overturning another.  This happens all the time and for good reason.  But rather deciding that DACA rights are now in play given their status change and reversion.  The may simply be a rationale/figleaf/hangout for subverting the law by a corrupt/biased judge, nevertheless it’s not considered a change in Presidential power to control the government agencies he’s in charge of.

            The difficulty in successfully impeaching him is it would require some number of red state senators to sacrifice their political careers, and that is a lot to ask from those leeches. The charges would need to be something that even his supporters would want him impeached for, like slaughtering puppies for fun. Just pulling out of Ukraine ain’t gonna cut it for that.

                Mitch Mcconnell, who is a uniparty globohomo stooge and who helped destroy the Tea Party movement, controls about 1/3 of the Republican Senate outright.  Yes, optically they need cover for impeaching him, but they would love to do it if given the opportunity.  Most of the rest of the Republican Senate are squishy in their views and certainly not dissidents or populists.

        I stick with my prediction that the plan is to kill him soon. I’d bet on sentencing day or the day he’s “led out of Trump Tower” (symbolically deposed as king of NYC).  The regime is cultivating riot/brawl conditions—a “happening” that ends in Trump being shot by a cop—at the big Trump spots in NYC.Someone definitely got some esoteric enjoyment from setting up the De Niro courthouse stunt. De Niro began his career as a ’68-era Living Theater / The Performance Group guy—improv actors who’d have real fights with the crowd, etc. He and De Palma got their start together as marginal characters in that scene. Nothing much happened at theDe Niro show, but he’s famous so it was a big story, and the film wasloud, reinforcing an equation we’ve heard the regime repeat for years now: Trump = chaos.Yesterday the cops crushed some MAGA idiots for unfurling a back-the-blue banner outside Trump Tower.No matter how many of our guys they kill, “the right” will never get the message that cops are ourunconditionalenemies.

            Telling the voters that they’re wrong, and/or insulting the voters, is a very new phenomenon in AINO politics, beginning as best as I can remember with The Precious in 2007 or ’08. I have not noticed it being done by Republicans yet. Slow with the new trends as always. Anyhow, I wonder if this is some kind of marker of late stage decline.

        They are going to roll out the bird flu scare, except they’ll claim it can be transmitted through the Internet and will kill 110 billion people in the first three months. The solution will be to vaccinate your computer by installing software (NoDissenticus – trademark to Pfizer) which stops you from going to infected sites, as listed by the regime. After all, if you catch bird flu off the Internet you could spread it to vulnerable people WHO WILL DIE HORRIBLY! In one such case, a white unvaccinated dude (who refused to wear a mask while on the internet) will spread bird flu to one of his ebony hued superiors who will die two days before the election. The resulting race riots will take place only in Trump strongholds, leading to Biden winning by such a huge margin they have to create more Electoral College votes out of thin air to award to him.

            I’m hoping the last “pandemic” was lightening in a bottle. It mostly caught people by surprise. There’s no surface level acknowledgement that we may have been scammed at a global scale. However, I don’t think most of the masses are ready to have their lives upended again for what they experienced as a bad cold. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

                Possibly true, but the lockdowns were the main point and a different means to that end may be tried such as a war that requires people to remain in their homes, just to spitball. It was no coincidence that the “15-minute city” emerged after the Covid tyranny.

                All depends on how they enforce it.  Some states will be more draconian, others will simply ignore it.  Likely the same states as last time.  There really wasn’t much enforcement in my neck of the woods other than shaming, and given that the mask Karens were proven ridiculous, it will have even less effect this time around.

I’m not surprised the green firms are tapping out because they can’t exist at 5% interest.
What is a bit surprising is that medical and defense customers are starting to put projects on hold, given what we know about the Fed’s money printing activities.
Yes, I contradicted myself a bit.

        lol Biden didn’t poop himself, or maybe he did who knows, but one thing is for sure, he wanted to sit down, and didn’t feel much like being there. He’d rather be on his beach in Rehoboth or wherever with Dr. Jill because he is tired, (unless they tell him he can jail a MAGA that’s the only time he has any energy. Dark Bradon energy they call it I guess.)

        There won’t be an election. That’s why they’re not even campaigning yet. They will have an “event” that will be the pretext to suspending or postponing indefinitely the election. It’s the only way they survive. This has been the plan since 2020.

            Agreed on that. And Biden is so unpopular that he’s creating Trump votes constantly. Just like Zelensky, he will find an emergency to cancel elections. He literally cannot lose power, his family owes so much grift to those both higher up (Obama) and lower (Garland, various black politicos) that he has to keep the grift going just to make the vig. Not to mention that if he loses, all his stunts targeting not just Trump but those around him and adjacent and those next (like Musk and his Defense backers — Musk did not buy Twitter on his own he was put up to it by certain parties in the Pentagon who did not like what they saw). So there is that.

        “Westerners who believe that the virtues and sins they are familiar with are fixed elements of the firmament or part of the natural law may not realize that they think that way merely because they grew up with them in their culture, which is a product of several millennia of intertwining classical western philosophy, Christianity and the honor system. Without that cultural fabric, they would have never consciously known if they felt envious or covetous, and there would be no guilt or shame associated with what is known as sinful behavior. Without the European cultural fabric, they would have never known the concept of sins and virtues, let alone a way to differentiate them.”Materials for Zman’s future article –https://www.lewrockwell.com/2024/02/jayant-bhandari/the-discovery-of-civilization/

        This June Debate thing isveryweird.  Regime toadies are trying to cast it as a way for Biden to get around “fake news” and tell “his story” which makes no sense.  More likely is that Biden is so bad off that they know that by early fall that all the coke in the world wouldn’t drag him across the finish line in a debate with a self-aware turnip.

        Good podcast and you made some great points of Biden. The reality is he is old and dumb. He is no longer resonating with voters.However, I feel like you let Trump off the hook for his carnie behavior. Trump is the celebrity television culture personified. While he says things that many on our side agree with, his behavior and character are awful. During the 2020 election he ran a recurring donation scam where he set up recurring payments from his supporters. He surrounds himself with shady characters and has a history of stiffing contractors.I feel like the election is a choice between two awful and unworthy men.

        Fairly big happening this weekend. The White House is surrounded, by Palestinian protestors holding up bloody paper mache masks/heads of Biden and Blinken, monuments defaced, the flag burnt. Police in retreat and inept. It not only shows to ordinary people the two standards: Hard Left Good, Whitey Bad, but the anti-Saturday people stuff is scaring big money men who wear funny hats on Saturday. The Regime (Dr. Jill, Obama, Garland and Blinken) are either unable or unwilling to cork stuff up.The other is the hostage rescue of four Israelis. Apparently both US and Israeli special forces hid out in one of the Gaza pier trucks and when discovered deep in Gaza had a firefight, entered homes where the hostages were and slotted the hostage keepers including an Al Jazerra journalist who was also the spokesperson for Hamas Medical ministry. The hostage was a young woman, over/under on the men in the house doing what Hamas does best?A bunch of civilians got killed, the Democratic hard left reaction is that civilian deaths outweigh the hostages, which again goes to the money men on Wall Street. They are making their own calculation. They have money, and are finding that is not enough. Like Crassus against Caesar, money loses to power of men under arms. The Hard Left has men under arms who are under protection of the police, thus those police are also under arms for the Hard Left. Who does Bill Ackman have to call out? No one.

            I am thinking this is a Mao Hundred Flowers boob bait for bubba moment. Let people think there will be no clampdown, see who acts like a secret Trump supporter, then the clampdown. They are not going to throw out the ability to jail Trump now, and remove him. Its probably aimed at some on Wall Street and in the government, to smoke them out and then destroy them as open Trump supporters and enemy of “Our Democracy.”

        Zman — Yes certain aspects of Wall Street, the Pentagon, Fortune 500 etc. would prefer Trump as the more stable, however their Faustian bargain cannot be undone. Its Joey Depends all the way. Joey Depends is unstoppable because the people behind him will not stop, ever.If you look at the signaling in Europe, the future is clear: A. US troops about 200K sent to Ukraine with very aggressive attempts to take out Russian air defenses and likely very high casualties both among airmen and on the ground. B. A draft, including up to age 75, but only for Straight White men, the older draftees working in various defense industries. C. Both happening around August. D. Mass arrests of any and all Trump supporters, voters, donors. E. Of course elimination of Trump Epstein-style.The FT has clearly signaled that mass deployment of US troops and mass conscription (but only of straight White males) is coming very, very soon. Yes including for defense work.Hillary!, Maxine Waters, and a whole bunch of Media/Democratic commentators have called for mass arrests of Trump voters, supporters, and donors. If budget Castreau can seize a waitress’s bank account for a $10 donation to truckers, Joey Depends can put you in a camp. Don’t ever doubt it. He can also arrest any dissenting Governor.Next, you have to look at who has real power. There are really on three people deciding things. Obama, who gets his vig from Joey Depends who gets his from First Crackhead. [Which is why the OJ style set up jury will find First Crackhead innocent of all charges — it was rigged that way from the start — First Crackhead is needed as the bag man most effective]. Next, Blinken, in charge of War with Russia and China. Finally, Garland, a true fanatic determined to eliminate White people everywhere. Garland is the most powerful and vengeful out of the three. No more  than Krupp or the Prussian Army Generals could influence policy in Germany 1942-45, can Wall Street, the military, or anyone else influence these three. They cannot be touched and are immune to any and all pressure.[Gianni Versace is the last celebrity to ever get killed by some dirt person back in the 1990s. No Cloud person ever needs to fear the Dirts as the security, surveillance cameras, AI, biometrics, cell phone cameras, and dna analysis makes getting to a cloud simply impossible.]Trump is likely to be sent to jail for 100 years, and dead before the convention ala Epstein. Republicans will nominate Nikki Haley and Mitt Romney as mass arrests sweep the nation and a state of emergency is declared to censor whatever Trump has on Biden/Obama (the only reason he’s still alive now). Hence all the AI fraud hysteria — preparation for whatever Trump has on a dead man switch. I would expect arrests of Abbot, and DeSantis, and Garland ruling Texas and Florida and other states himself personally. All those illegal alien criminals let in will be sent to run wild against YT. People like Musk, Thiel, etc. must know their time is limited too. Their wealth is no shield against the FBI and DOJ. The purge is coming, just like the movie.Obama, Blinken, and Garland decide who lives, and who dies. They are not ever giving up that power. They can prop up Joey Depends as a “hologram” President for years. If the public does not matter, and they do not, neither does Wall Street, the Pentagon, or any other power center. They will do what they are told, or else. That is the whole purpose of the slow-motion stuff they are doing to Trump — to scare other groups into compliance.

                Steve Sailer keeps reminding people that David Bazelov father of Emily, made a fortune selling off the assets of the Nisei interned during WWII. Similar to the fortunes made selling off the assets of the Soviet Union in 1992. So a bunch of very connected companies: Blackrock, State Street, and Vanguard, with trillions under management, would love to get your stuff. The arrests can always be privatized. There are a lot of young military age men from other countries with nothing to do and various paid cell phones. Many of them are criminals released form Venezuelan and African jails.If there is no dead man’s switch, why is Trump still alive? They have shown no hesitation with any Clinton associates or Epstein or Seth Rich. I still wonder, why is Trump even alive at this point?

                Germany did “ok” from 1941-45 using mostly forced labor from: France, the Netherlands, Poland, Denmark, and the Balkans. They even made the V-2s with forced labor, sometimes there would be sabotage, the enforcement against it was so brutal and severe in terms of crimes against humanity and basic human decency that overall, the sabotage had an effect but not decisive.It can work, and has worked, for a while. Where it falls apart is high-quality, complex weapons systems that require SCALE, that is mass production on the very highest quality, because it gives a decisive fighting edge. Two examples being the B-29 Stratofortress, that cost more than the Atomic Bomb, and the Bomb itself. The B-29, the only pressurized long range heavy bomber of the war, was the delivery system and the Bomb the decisive war-ending weapon. There was no way the Axis could ever have pulled that off with their forced labor systems. However our betters think they know better. And that AI is the magic beans that will get them up to the Giant’s land.

            An actual in the wild Q-Tard still exists?! I thought they had rounded like 95% of you up after Jan 6th. Still trusting the plan Q bro? Just 2 more weeks!
