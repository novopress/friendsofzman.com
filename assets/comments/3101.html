To an American, there are three parts to Canada. The really white section that speaks English. The section full of red necks who speak French and then the land of the little mushroom people called Nova Scotia.

        Here’s the interesting stuff from the Ottawa shootings. When the shootings started, Harper was in a meeting with MPs. They hussled him into a closet and some stood guard. Some of the MPs took the flag poles and made them into spears. Can you imagine anyone in our House of Representatives with the wit to do that?  And Mr Vickers, the guy that stopped it?  He got up next to where the shooter was hidden, dropped and rolled to the guy, firing straight up while lying on his back. Mr Vickers looks like Batmans butler, Alfred. He would have had to have practiced that move at some point in his career. Again, can you imagine a Secret Service guy doing that?

        Showing empathy for the victim(s) is the excuse-du-jour for not expressing anger towards the perpetrator.   Can you imagine anyone in authority saying anything in public about taking revenge for such a heinous killing?  Think of the children!

        While I get your point about male emotions on display, I do think there’s a difference between getting “choked up” and squirting tears. And in the particular example you’ve referenced, I think there’s more at play here than just public emotional displays. Notice that no one made mention of the elephant in the room. Was this just any random gunman? It was not. The killer was a soldier for Islam, a jihadist. He struck at the seat of Ottawa’s government, right in their parliament building. That is a total in-your-face by the Moslems, and has given the Ottawans some food for thought. Given our citizenrys’ propensity to despise Congress, maybe we wouldn’t be as shook up if it happened here, but then again, who knows. I would expect these sorts of strikes to continue because Islam is on the march.

        Sob stories and public sobbing.
Whether sobbing for donations for some “worthwhile cause’ or another to the sobbing on cue of some unfortunate put upon victim or their family members scoring their fifteen seconds of fame, tears are the gold standard of TV news. Tears of sorrow, tears of joy, sometimes I feel the need to put a bucket under the screen.
Tears used to be reserved for very private expression of loss, at home with family and friends. Public sobbing is a sad reflection of our very sick society.

        “But it’s also a country that supported the U.S. in some of its decisions and more than likely those are the consequences that it faces because of that.”
Fuck that guy. Fuck him right in the ear.

        I suspect that not enough 11yr old boys have been told to dispatch ‘bessy’ or ‘floppy’ in time to have it cleaned and on the plate for dinner.

        “Why do public figures have to pretend to be emotionally distraught over events happening far away from them?….It seems like the high status males in modern times feel the need to blubber in public.”
