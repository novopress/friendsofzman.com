        I get virtue-signaled for my Avatar on a pretty regular basis. Today it was some obviously cucked mainstream conservative. Warms my heart every time that happens. They see the flag and it just starts them foaming at the mouth and spewing crazy non sequiturs.

        I’m not one of the old guard, though I’m not young enough to be considered of the same generation as the kids in this thing, but I tend to think people beating up on Taylor for his approach just don’t understand what it will take to get the “Chad/Stacy” normals involved, and grow the movement. I’ve played a couple of Jared Taylor videos for people I know (center-left and center-right boomers) and their reaction is to be attentive, and to come away with a good opinion of this guy and his ideas, even though he is cast as a devil by CNN and the SPLC. That kind of thing is worth its weight in gold to our movement. The younger kids with the sweep undercut hairstyles and the fascination with Italian futurism, etc., are harder-edged and harder for the normies to digest, but in their defense the young kids of the left are much more psychotic and vicious than their older Great Society counterparts, so I can’t blame the kids on the dissident right for their attraction to types like Evola or even Hitler. They’re facing a future that may be an annihilating abyss, not a debate. Fire can’t be met with anything but fire.

            If the goal is to build a white identity movement it’s necessary to recognize that there are whites with a wide range of views and attitudes and that a wide range of approaches is required to reach them.

        Fuentes is…..NINETEEN?  Holy moly.  He’s a lot more confident and assured than I was at that age, and by a long shot, when my thoughts were mostly occupied by my bong and mostly elusive (at the time) fafuna.

        Don’t sell yourself short, Z. You are my favorite blogger on the intrawebz, and I read just about everybody within a stone’s throw of Alt-rightism. Sailer does make me laugh the most though, the snarky bastard.I’m moving up to the DelMarVa next month to do my part to help the .gov spend itself into oblivion. I’d be honored to buy you a drink sometime.

            Yeah …hope it doesn’t go to his head, but Z’s always one of my first 5 stops of the morning.  (From there usually over to SS, then I skim Maggie’s for Outrage d’jour.   Catch Derb @ Takis.  I know I am only skimming the surface, but it’s enough to red-pill me for the rest of the day….LOL LOL)  Z’s output is prodigious, considering he has a life to live as well.   A national treasure, right up there with our (hopefully-soon-slimmed-down) National Monument system…=)

            That could be a fun little geurrilla action. Make a bunch of little confederate flag stickers sized to just cover the (((x))) on your typical coexist bumper sticker, stick them on Prius’ and Subarus all over town, hang back and watch the freakout.

                No chit. Today on the bike I fell in behind an econo-chitbox with bumper stickers that informed me that the vehicle was powered by b*tchdust, and that strong was the new sexy. I didn’t get a look at that swamp mamma driving it as I passed, but I did wish I still chewed tobacco and spit a lot.Putting the Stars And Bars on a car like that would be entertaining for the hysteria it would create… but it would also be a mockery of the men that fought under that flag too.If we don’t take our history and symbols seriously we can hardly complain when others don’t either.

            It would be more fun to make a Trump bumper sticker that sort of looked like the “coexist” one, and put it on cars with the latter….

        1) on the addictive nature of e-celeb infighting. I’ve been realizing this myself lately. For months now I’ve been strangely proud to have given up TV almost entirely since there have been so many YouTube things to watch every night. But lately I’m getting exhausted, and realize I don’t care about the drama and it’s not even really that entertaining. Also, even the more content-driven creators don’t really excite me that much. So much of it is repetitive. The live streams are perhaps something like talk radio used to be–a way for people to vicariously “socialize” by listening to like-minded hosts gab about stuff. Considering how socially  dangerous it is to be “out” as a red-pilled citizen, I can understand the impulse to assuage loneliness this way (and I do it myself). But I still wonder what “the next step” is.2) On the Confederate battle flag. I remember a State Fair I went to as a kid in the 1980s where they sold mini (maybe 12 inch) US and Confederate flags, and no one batted an eye. Lots of people could be seen carrying around the CSA flags. (this was around the time The Dukes of Hazzard was on in prime time TV)

        Fuentes is obviously sharp, too sharp for his age. Eventually, with his talents he will end up with a good paying safe gig. God knows where if we aren’t all gulaged soon. Of course he touched the third rail repeatedly,so who knows.
Still would like to know about Sailer’s absense on Taki. His only full article appeared there.

        Mr. Derbyshire was quite complimentary about your output/quality ratio when I had the pleasure of meeting him a few weeks ago.  Good to see a focus on de-emphasizing the e-drama queens.  Success depends on depth and breadth of organization.  Having a couple of those college age offspring, its interesting to see how they are managing the dissonance of having grown up in a “color blind” world, yet now increasingly find that race and gender are increasingly the only thing that matters.   Seeing things like Google’s “purge all the white, cis-gendered, male” candidates from the pool (regardless of qualification) has been shocking to them.

                It may be Sailer’s IQ is too high for most people to follow his thoughts. Irony drips from his pen. His mind sprouts spontaneously myriad insights and corralling them is not easy for readers to do hence he is blamed as being a poor writer.

            Sailer is great, but sometimes his bemused reaction, his arch in the face of tragedy, wears on my nerves. I understand you need a sense of humor to survive these times, but I always keep waiting for him to break bad, and he never does. He’s aware (very aware) for instance of the JQ, but he always tiptoes, and a cynical part of me thinks he is still holding out hope that one of the larger media organs may eventually come calling if there’s ever a big enough shift in the culture in our direction. All those shitbags like Ross Douthat read him (and steal liberally from him) though they’ll never admit it, so I guess I can’t blame Steve for hoping to get some credit or an invite from the people who constantly crib from him.

                Sailer is radioactive to big media. His support of Eugenics and using genetic tech to create superior humans alone makes him a pariah.
Then there’s the JQ that he’s always banging on. Again another reason why no one in the old media will acknowledge him.

        As in any war, there are many campaigns and methodologies of opposition that typically come to bear during the course of events. The organizing campaign is indeed necessary and fundamental, but ultimately it may not be determinative because of macro issues. Some of us are working the problem from a different perspective (think skunk works) and there is robustness in this diversity of opposition.

        It was a common idea, not so long ago, that there would have been many (more) notable women artists, and scientists, etc from the past — if men hadn’t kept them from doing their thing.   Then all of the so called restraints on female creativity and entrepreneurial energy were “removed” (i.e. acknowledged as having never existed in the first place) we still don’t get anything meaningful from the ladies.   Why is that Zman?

        I’d be most appreciative z if you could expand and comment on the apparent contentious generational debate in the q and a Fuentes presentation in a future post.

        One excellent insight that Spencer has shared since he went into semi-hiatus is that the identity movement can’t be led by anonymous people.That has always resulted in disaster.  Leaders need to be known and public.  They need to be vetted for skeletons and fake resumes.  They need to work up to leadership.I think if you decide to make the move you could possibly be a speaker at a future AmRen conference.Until then we’ll enjoy the blog, but take your criticisms of the public figures in the movement with many grains of salt.Derby is a great writer, but he’s still not operating at Jared’s level.  Who organized the conference?  How many has he held now?Epigone is still a man of mystery, like you.  That’s the A league, not the bigs.

            I don’t know if anyone ever thought otherwise. Spencer’s troubles have nothing to do with anonymity or the lack of it.
As far as myself, I do what I do, because I can do it well and it needs to be done.

        Your description of Pat Casey, Greg hood, nick Fuentes perfectly illustrates three different types that a movement needs. Leaders, intellectuals, content creators. Totally different skillsets.
Our thing has accidentally combined those roles in many cases.
If everybody stays in their lane, good things can get done.
