        Bill, you and I read the post the same way.  It starts out discussing one issue and then switches to finish up on an entirely separate issue.  Doubtless that zig-zag accounts for how the zman got his screen name.

        Limbaugh will win because what the DCCC is claiming about him is provably false.

        “The law is clear about interfering with the business dealings of others for the purpose of causing one of more parties harm.”I’m fairly certain you’re wrong about that. The 1st Amendment generally guarantees us the right to say what we want about another person, as long as it isn’t false. If I decide to petition a company to stop doing business with someone, you can be 1,000% certain that this is protected speech.If, on the other hand, your opinion is correct, then no one could ever say anything negative about a person or a company, ever.I understand where you’re coming from, it’s just obvious to me you’re wrong.Also, note that Limbaugh is suing for defamation, not for tortuous interference or anything similar.

        The left feels confident that the judicial and media systems have their backs, and they do. But overconfidence will lead to recklessness, and Limbaugh is not the type to bring a lawsuit he cannot win. The discovery process alone is going to create hell for Democrats. This will actually be very interesting.

            It is a no lose for Limbaugh. It is free publicity that his audience can support. It comes as the Cult is on its heals. Inside the DNC they are about to engage in a night of many knives. Discovery would be a very unpleasant process.

        Then again, there was that petition signed off byseated members of the legislature….Some of us are better than others at recognizing patterns.Perhaps Mr. Obama should consult with Mr. Sharpton on the “optics” on this?
