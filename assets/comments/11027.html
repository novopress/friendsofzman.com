        Your point on smart White guys is spot on. A commenter on Sailers’ notes that being smart is now considered White Privilege or something, from InfoWars.https://www.infowars.com/not-being-stupid-is-cognitive-privilege-now/.Essentially smart White guys are being chased out of everywhere. Even Silicon Valley is under assault, to replace Smart White dudes with various Oprah watching women, racial grievance mongers, and the like. Per Heartiste’s showcasing of the latest research, women while ovulating value social dominance and aggression the most and find intelligence and warmth the least attractive traits in men; we can see what the sex market does when women suddenly find all the power balance tilts their way. Not just from sexual marketplace power but consumerist purchasing power.I think the story of the 21st Century will be that of Smart White guys making themselves enough of a pain point that endless female-driven SJW jihads pass them over, for fear of retaliation and payback which can be considerable. I am not optimistic about the continuance of the American nation state, other than a giant melange of Muslims, Africans, and the rest; but I do think as only the Alt-Right or whatever you want to call it will be the home for smart White guys that rabble can be persuaded by spectacular examples to refrain from pursuing us into the weeds.Certainly the party and status quo of Oprah, various Kardashians and rappers, Allahu-snackbar, and the like have little attraction for smart White guys who are waking up to the fact that they are on the menu as the main course.

        Years ago Cass Sunstein, Obama’s “legal  scholar” par excellence wrote an article for Bloomberg titled (and I’m not making this up), “Could Bowling Leagues and the PTA Breed Nazis?” Reading this article was the moment I realized that it wasn’t enough just to “meet” online, like here: a physical presence and encounter is an important act of defiance and scares all the right (left) people. Manlet Rick Wilson wants them to believe we’re “mostly childless single men who masturbate to anime.” It’s harder to believe this when we meet in public.Everyone I know who’s been to the conferences says Sam Dickson is usually the best speaker there. Greg Johnson’s “Waking up from the American Dream” is the best, most important and most accessible of the dissident right books I’ve read not by Taylor or Sam Francis.

            Sunstein was just insulting the people he considered the enemy. In reality the Left given how it radicalizes young females into feminazis ensures that most male Lefties have very little chance for sex or a healthy relationship with a female.
The only way most Lefty whites can reproduce is by converting others to their cult.

            Excellent comment, but my upvote is for “manlet Rick Wilson.”
From Cass Sunstein’s bowling alley “Nazis,” to Robert Putnam’s “Bowling Alone,” one has to wonder, what’s the deal w/lefties and bowling?!?

        Z is a polymath. I assume there is a topic he has yet to study and does not have a thoughtful perspective on. That assumption is based entirely on an understanding that no man is omniscient. I’m entirely lacking any empirical evidence to back up my assumption, though.
He’s even more accessible in person than he is in written form. I didn’t think it was possible, either, but it is.

        Read Jared Taylor’s book ‘White Identity’ when it came out in 2011.  I felt like I was walking alone in a wasteland until then.  Big turning point for me.  Glad you are able to experience this, Zman.  Looking forward to hearing more.

            When you hear people complaining about the USA it is because we can envision how much better things can be. But we would not want to live anywhere else. I’ve been and lived in various corners of the earth and like them very much. The USA has always been home base, and when coming back always appreciate the peace and freedom we enjoy and realize that we have more of these things than any other people.

        The rest of the comments make the serious points, and I agree with nearly all of them.  What Z has – that very few do – are the Hidden Gems he tucks away….

        Let’s hope that International Man of Mystery doesn’t turn out to be an FBI informant taking names. I know some (very paranoid) people who believe the left is only biding its time before going full Bolshevik on us. Please tell me they’re wrong.

            That’s not a bad suspicion about the IMM. No healthy movement should be so dependent upon one person.It’s btw that leftists are always on the lookout for opportunities to go full Bolshevik. Even the piecemeal communism of “progressivism” is just a makeshift bundle of strategy and tactics for biding time until circumstances favor a revolution for totalitarianism. The alarming popularity of Bernie Sanders last year among children should have reminded everyone of this important truth about “progressives”. It’s also no secret that governement schooling is a vast left-wing indoctrination racket into which millions are dragooned in anticipation of making them comfortable with the idea of the expected Bolshevik moment. So I don’t think that your aquaintances’ fear of commie revolution is unjustified. Rather, their paranoia, as you call it, is motivated by self-evident facts.

            Spent some time on the TRS boards, have you? There’s healthy paranoia and then there’s autistic paranoia. Many people give the left altogether too much credit. It’s not that they lack the desire to round us all up, it’s that the vast majority of them are so up their own asses, it’s nigh impossible for them to even formulate the plan.

                For a movement that “gets too much credit”, the left has completely had their way for an entire century, and a lot of people who got in their way had their careers ruined, or simply died untimely deaths.
Is it paranoia when they really ARE out to get you? The body counts racked up by Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot speak for themselves.

            Thanks. So far the podcast is confirming something I’ve always suspected. There’s some overlap between podcasts people and blog readers, it is not the same crowd. I’ve had a few people tell me they found the podcast and then went to the blog, never having heard of it. This means I am trying to poison the minds of a whole new set of people!

        I notice the word smart seems a bit over used here today.  Not because I have any particular insight about the IQ of our host, readers or the AmRen attendees, but rather I’ve learned to be very cautious when too many people at the edge of any distribution think they have things figured out about or for the rest of us.  Even more so when I seem to be getting exactly the messages that resonate so well in my particular personal echo chamber.  Nonetheless, I will figure out a way to explore Jared Taylor’s work on your recommendation.

                “Smart” can be used badly or well. Badly when it is used as a proxy for intelligence, well when it is meant to convey that someone is being smart.

            caution. always good idea. however. consider. it is much more difficult to live in a echo chamber on the right than it is if you are on the left, as the former is under constant attack, while the latter is endlessly reenforced. not sure how much of your “caution” is due to guilt you feel for having thoughts that big media and academia has trained us to be shameful.

            Maybe. A big thing there is respecting anonymity, for obvious reasons. I did not make any effort to notice anyone’s name, real or otherwise. That makes it easier to avoid mistakes.

        “I thought that AmRen was an older crowd ”Older than who?  These are relative terms.How old are you, Z Man?  It would certainly make parsing your frequent comments on age and generations simpler.

            I’m 50. The guys featured on AmRen are all late 60’s and 70’s. That does not sound like a big gap, but it really is a huge leap from Gen X to Boomer.

                The Baby Boom years are usually considered 1946 to 1964, there are obviously big gaps between those born in 1946, the true kids of the returning war vets, and those born in 1964.    Assuming you were born in 1967 you are sort of on the cusp of the boom itself.Of course some demographers and sociologists have gone further and broken out Generation Jones from the Boomers.  This seems pretty smart to me;  in 2000 election Jones’ers were far more conservative in voting patterns than either Boomers or X’ers.   You might find it a useful mental construct if you continue to view things using generational filters, as is a little trend on the Alt Right at the moment.http://www.generationjones.com/?page_id=6Leaving aside the ideal of Jones, you are left with the fact that Late Boomers and early X’ers have a lot more in common with each other than with Millennials, which starts with those born in the mid 1980s till about 2000.  If you had kids when you were 25 to 30 they would be millennials.There are more millennials than boomers now, they are the biggest cohort, and they will all be eligible to vote in 2018

                At first I was offended by Zman’s focus on age.However, there is an important point underlying those observations.A movement has to be comprised of thinkers and doers. JT, et al, are the thinkers. Not that others are not smart, but wisdom – experience – is essential for crafting the leading principles.The doers are the young. Full of passion and energy, but also a bit clumsy.The last year has seen the bringing together of the two. The young-uns are maturing rapidly, becoming cohesive and disciplined. The oldsters are smiling warmly and watching the wobbly legs strengthen and stretch.It’s amazing and inspiring.
