        Good Morning Z,Again thanks for the excellent debate coverage and analysis.While Trump did not ‘win’ the ‘debate’, Trump did not lose.“The guerrilla wins by not losing.”Most polls seem to indicate that Trump’s supporters were fine with his performance.Howie’s listeners were 3 to 1 okay with Trump’s performance,when I was listening yesterday.I didn’t watch because there was no else on the stage that I wouldvote for besides Trump.I have only two issues: Guns &amp; Immigration.Everything else is fixable, but these two issues cannot be reversed.As Trump has pointed out, the only reason immigration is even an issue is because of him.If you replace large swaths of the US population with peasants from Mexico,Central America and other Third World Hell-holes, as Howie would say,we will have our very own Third World Hell-hole right here.America as we know it will be ‘voted’ out of existence – If it isn’t gone already.If we lose our gun rights, we lose the Constitution’s “Doomsday Provision”,See: Judge Kosinski’s dissent – Silveira v. Lockyer.http://www.thegunzone.com/rkba/rkba-9.htmlEvery other candidate up there will have to depend on the Open Borders Lobby for their funding: the Chamber of Commerce, the Kochs, Sheldon Adelson,the Marriotts, the Silicon Valley billionaires, etc.So ‘immigration reform’/’pathway to citizenship’/’we can’t deport 12 million people’, will be the order of the day for all but Trump.Every Republican candidate will also need Rupert Murdoch and Fox News.(I posted what follows earlier, on LotB)It’s no real surprise that Fox had the long knives out for The Donald,but Trump should have been ready for it.The boss at Fox, Murdoch, is an “Immigration Reform”/”Pathway to Citizenship”/’Amnesty’ enthusiast.The anti ‘open-borders’ argument has always been MIA at Fox News(and the Wall Street Journal).Here’s Rupert in his own words:“Is the idea of immigration reform complicated by the fact that some immigrants went outside the legal system to be here? Yes. It is complicated even more by the fear some Americans have, quite naturally, of how changing populations might also change our culture, communities and economic circumstances.”“We need to give those individuals who are already here—after they have passed checks to ensure they are not dangerous criminals—a path to citizenship so they can pay their full taxes, be counted, and become more productive members of our community. ”http://www.wsj.com/articles/rupert-murdoch-immigration-reform-cant-wait-1403134311Now Murdoch has the NY Post and the WSJ attacking Trump – Again no surprise.Ugh! With allies like Fox, the WSJ &amp; Murdoch, conservatives don’t need enemies.Don’t forget to order your ¡Jeb!

        I think you’re wrong about Carson. Except for the first question directed to him, I think he acquitted himself beautifully, with grace and humor. I’ve seen many interviews with him and he’s pretty solid on the issues that matter to most people, including the values that are sorely missing. Yes, sometimes he’s a little rough “off the cuff”, and speaks more slowly than most. Not surprising, as he isn’t a professional pol.Bush went nowhere and will continue to maintain his low polling numbers. He was a great gov for Florida. That’s not gonna translate to what the country needs today. Too bad, Repub Establishment. This time, you’re not getting your way.I’ve also seen many interviews with Fiorina. She’s great on most of the issues, articulate, and willing to attack Shrillary. I’ll be taking a closer look.Trump didn’t shine, but he was deliberately “gotcha-ed” by Fox News. He should have anticipated and prepared better. Still, he didn’t flame out. Still the front runner.You are spot-on about Kasich. And I’m not supporting him, but I thought Huckabee did really well.

        your dead wrong. this debate was fox vs. trump. trump won. the base is pissed and right now they are getting to see who the bought off insiders are. in supporting trump the people are showing their contempt for the beltway crowd just as much as they’re showing support for trump. the beltway crowd  thinks trumps success is proof of the stupidity of people and not a reaction to their failings, a desperate reaction but one long overdue. and in trying to take trump down they have shown their contempt for the people. they went to take that piss they say is rain and the wind turned.

        “…the feel of a beauty pageant.” I thought the same, especially considering Fox’s ever-present blonde representative with the “Bring ‘em on out!” order, ‘cause the contestants need reminding who is in charge of this thing. Missing was Peggy Lee singing “Is That All There Is?”

        I know you don’t care what I think about You Know What, so I generally keep my mouth shut around here, but I did want to chime in to say this was hilarious, particularly the bits about Jindal and Will. I find I generally agree with what you say (never mind about You Know What), and it’s pretty much always amusingly put.

        My first memory of politics is watching the 1952 Democratic Convention on TV (7 inch screen, rabbit ears). I have some random thoughts about the guys I like.Walker reminds me of Eisenhower. Nobody really remembers much of what he says but somehow he gets things done and people wonder how it happened.Cruz is Barry Goldwater redux. The difference is that he won’t be running against the memory of a a martyred prince. That said, we haven’t had real good luck with Senators (Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Obama), not in a policy sense but rather in forging a semblance of unity.Perry is an enigma. Things went too well in Texas to discount his governing chops. He just hasn’t caught on. Maybe because he reminds people of Bush 43 with his Texas drawl. I think GWB was the best of the lot since Reagan but he’s a political liability these days.That leaves me with Jeb Bush as the best bet if my guys don’t make it. I live in Florida now and he is fondly remembered as Governor. He won’t roll back the regulations much or shut down the cronies but I hope He can get a handle on the more radical policies foisted on us by Obama.
