        It’s really too bad that the HBD crowd largely self-destructed over Covid. They did a lot of great work, but falling for that hype irreparably damaged their credibility. The story of why and how this happened would make an interesting column.

            They failed to differentiate between science in the abstract and science as actually practiced in the real world, dominated by commercial and ideological interests focused on money and power, not truth.

                Dutchboy: “science as actually practiced in the real world, dominated by commercial and ideological interests focused on money and power“I completely agree with what you wrote, but muh gut instinct tells me that the lust for money and power simply pales in comparison to the charismatic religious fervor which the Oligarchs bring to the cause in promulgating the Depopulationist agenda.The Oligarchs want us all dead [or at least sterilized].Truth be told, it would be fascinating to know how many of the HBDers also want us dead.There’s likely a non-trivial intersection between the set of all HBDers and the set of all Depopulationist Oligarchs.

                    The intersection between the two is Social Darwinism. At least some HBDers would like to eliminate those they think don’t measure up to their standards (e.g., those with low IQs, handicaps or the wrong skin tone). The oligarchs would like to eliminate just about everybody but themselves. It is  remarkable how riches seem to breed misanthropy, frequently disguised as philanthropy (Bill Gates being a prime example).

                Z got Covid right.  Why I first learned to respect his opinion.  And why I will always be grateful to him.  Not saying I agree with him on everything, especially evolution, but when the rubber hit the road he got it right.

            Anti-Dem: “It’s really too bad that the HBD crowd largely self-destructed over Covid.”
They proved to have been Group Thinkers [Herd Creatures] masquerading in the psychological costumes of Free Thinkers.
There’s nothing quite like an existential crisis to separate the wheat from the chaff.

            The HBD crowd has the same worldview as the blank slate crowd. Namely, they have the same belief in the validity of science, and believe that science should shape political decision-making. The difference between the two is basically an argument over interpreting data. Thus, the HBD crowd was caught up in covid hysteria because they accept the left wing premise of science’s role in human affairs, and in this instance agreed with the official claims. These guys aren’t skeptics.

                Science should shape decision-making, the emphasis on shape rather than determine. Other factors like cultural mores should, of course, play a role. One of the problems of the blank slate crowd is that they only do limited science.I have seen this from the inside and it was one of the things that redpilled me. It’s not so much a disagreement over science (observations and the meaning that can be drawn from them within the context of known natural law) as it is a belief that science mustALWAYSplay a secondary role to ephemeral political considerations. The global warming crisis used to be the global cooling crisis, if you are old enough to remember.They are perfectly capable of looking at a data set, correctly understanding what it means, realizing that the conclusions do not support their political objectives, then lying about it in the most plausible way possible,sometimes skillfully. They have no shame for having deviated from the scientific trail of truth, because in their own eyes they answer to a higher truth.

            What was clear early on is that many of the mouthpieces of HBD were aging boomers (Sailer Cochran, Derb, Unz) who were simply afraid of dying.  Extremely well read and researched commenters (like Hail and AE Newman) regularly took Sailer to task at the time, but Sailer’s believe in covid was/is religious. Arguing with him was like arguing with a Born Again that there is no God.

            Probably because Unz and Sailer are both boomers who were at a higher risk for the flu.  My dad never got the mRNA gene therapy but all his co-maga boomer friends did.

                In my circle of acquaintances it was the Millennials and Gen X who ran out and got the jab and still test themselves for “covid” whenever they get a sniffle. But then they’re all lefties so I think that’s the common denominator. The lefties l know of all ages are also big on mandatory fluoridation because “poor people”(i.e. blacks) don’t take care of their teeth and don’t question giving their kids 36 vaccines before they turn two.    Freethinkers they’re not unless it’s degenerate stuff.

        “In other words, if the people with real power refuse to go where science about human nature must lead, then what is the point of knowing any of this?”I was reading another article on a separate topic and came across this –https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-forgotten-science-of-vaccine“Disease enhancement from a mismatching vaccine is a rarely discussed but well-known problem. For example, a reader and physician who worked in the NIH was assigned to study this issue from 2009-2011 and followed a cohort of vaccinated children and pregnant months over 3 flu seasons also discovered a cleartrend of negative vaccine efficacy. When she submitted her analysis, however,she was removed from the NIH and blacklisted from future employment(and as a result, she understandably harbors great disdain for Anthony Fauci).”I guess the people with real power allow these studies to identify rebels from early on 🙂

            The segment of the right that considers itself atemporarily embarrassedelite has an endless,endlessrefrain/lament: We need to get some of the existing elite on our side to get that “cycle” going and take our rightful place at (or groveling near) the top.Here’s the problem: No wealthy man shares any understanding with any of us, and there’s no sign anywhere that they might. Thiel will pay Moldbug to say Thiel should be king, and Musk will let half of us talk half of our usual shit on Twitter (in exchange for our personally identifiable “data,” deliverable to…). That’s the limit of it.The system is massively retarded in many ways, but it’s ruthlessly competent at screening. The regime, the Cathedral, “leftism”—whatever—isn’t ideological. It’s social. They’refriends.

                Under some legal systems it is my understanding that one can be convicted of slander or libel even if what one is charged with saying is true. Similarly witness the German AfD fräulein convicted of hate speech for posting reportedly true facts.

            ZMan: “In other words, if the people with real power refuse to go where science about human nature must lead, then what is the point of knowing any of this? Further, there must be some material explanation for why people with heads full of oogily-boogily seem to rise to the top of liberal societies. Perhaps evolution does not care about empiricism as much as the fans of evolutionary biology insist.”Paul Gottfried: “When she submitted her analysis, however, she was removed from the NIH and blacklisted from future employment (and as a result, she understandably harbors great disdain for Anthony Fauci)”There’s something of an ever-so-slight categorical problem here [verging on a categorical error].We’re dealing with two types of behaviors, and two types of DNA propelling the behaviors.The first type of behavior belongs to the solitary isolated hominid, existing in situ.The second type of behavior belongs to the hominid as it interacts with fellow hominids, flourishing [or declining or floating along catatonically] in vivo.Apparently hominids have developed competing personality types which [at the extremes] largely prefer either rank solitude or full immersion in the social aspects of society.Most of us here in the Dissident Right likely are of relatively solitary personality types.Whereas likely 110% of all Sh!tlibs [on the Left] are of fully sociable personality types.To the extent that the solitary personality type has a great deal of time to wonder &amp; ponder &amp; experiment &amp; introspect &amp; extrospect &amp; reflect &amp; remember &amp; reminisce, the solitary personality type can make great strides in singular pursuits.However, Mother Nature has also imbued in hominids the capacity for GROUP behavior; behavior which is not confined to the self, but which in fact flourishes in the combined energies of the group, and those personalities will have an entirely different set of genes propelling their behavior.In particular, genetically-propelled group behavior inevitably becomes scleroticly oncologically hepatically parasitized by the Hive Mind of Passive Aggression [what Z calls “Managerialism”, the Ne Plus Ultra of which is of course the Deep State itself]; and, over time, these increasingly Byzantine hominid social structures inevitably start collapsing from within, due to the overwhelming psycho-sociological weight of the inevitable dissembling &amp; disingenousness &amp; dishonesty &amp; pure rank dastardliness of group-driven behavior.So we’re dealing with two entirely different genetic strategies for hominid survival: genes for Free Thought versus genes for Group Thought.What’s really scary is when the two camps intermingle sexually, producing children with one Free Thinking parent and one Group Thinking parent; I’m not sure whether that hybridism strengthens the child’s evolutionary survival potential, or weakens the child’s evolutionarysurvivalpotential.And then there’s the question of whether a predilection for Free Thought tends to be determined by a dominant gene or a recessive gene, and whether a predilection for Group Thought tends to be determined by a dominant gene or a recessive gene.These are extremely complicated [arguably infinitely complex] phenomena.PS: The above is not meant to imply that Free Thinkers are necessarily moral creatures, although there is a great deal to be said for Immanual Kant’s fundamental thesis, which holds that Logic is a necessarily a subspecialty of Morality.

        “Thirty years ago whenThe Bell Curvewas released, what would become the HBD world was primarily focused on intelligence.”But of course the focus was on intelligence because people who fancy themselves as being fucking armchair geniuses only consider that, similar to how negro social justice grifters only focus on skin color.The focus should be on behavior, not intelligence – because for example, even highly intelligent negroes are still prone to chimping out if their extremely fragile inferiority complex is triggered.Everybody lauds Sailer for his supposed genius, but I get the impression the guy wouldn’t last 3 fucking days in a remote area due to the inability to actually provide food and shelter for himself.the intelligence worshipers are disloyal turds anyway.  The white ones will gladly trade lower IQ whites (but perfectly law abiding and hard working) for supposed high IQ Hans even though those people do not share whites’ moral framework, and will just as easily cheat their way into power as they would torture an animal to death for pleasure.

            Mike Tre:  You get it, but most of the newbies (and plenty of the regulars) here do not.  IQ does not equal wisdom and/or common sense, let alone practicality.  That is why we need White people across the IQ spectrum, not some diverse society of supposed smart people.  The HBD purists are like the attendees at a Mensa meeting – high on their own supply.  And – as another Sailer commenter who is wasting his time there says – Loyalty to one’s own people matters at least as much as anything else, and often a good deal more.

                IQ is fascinating to people who like to play with measurements that reduce to numbers. It correlates well with some talents and outcomes but, as you point out, not with all the attributes that matter.

            I read the other day that IQ testing is just a measure of language intelligence. I’m going to give this some more thought, but it does lead me to think that any conclusions based on IQ are all talk.

                Thanks.  One thing that should be blindingly clear is that IQ absolutely does not automatically translate to moral or good or even loyal.

                    True, but it ought to be just as clear that ethnicity doesn’t do so, either. Unqualified race chauvinism is not any better than unqualified IQ chauvinism.

                        That is perfectly acceptable, but people should still be free to associate with whom they choose.  Forced integration is no more just and moral than forced segregation.  Probably worse. Strong nations are built upon ethic homogeneity.  .

        If the purpose of education is to teach logical thinking, it is a complete and total failure.  Most people do not and cannot think logically in a general way.  They might be able to think perfectly logically in their own narrow specialty, but not generally.  This is especially true if the consequences of logical thinking is to become an outcast.

            It seems that for many years society survived and thrived as hunter-gatherers relying on their own wits about themselves and instinct. As we evolved, structure became important and with structure logical thinking. Maybe that’s what you need to thrive within the logical box we have constructed, but it seems to me the hunter-gatherer didn’t have too much time to ponder all that.

                A variation: the dizzying, accelerating pace of technological change. Human beings are very adaptable but surely there are limits and stuff starts to break down at some point. As a recent Dark Horse podcast put it, to a large degree a child grows up in a different world from what awaits him when he reaches adulthood.

The internet, the cell phone and the computerization of everything have made life more dizzyingly different than our parents could have conceived. It is the only life our children have known.

                            Cecil sharpe, the great ethnomusicologist had an assistant who makes an excellent firsthand observation of this:In the summer of 1951, with the assistance of the Library of Congress, I spent three-and-a-half weeks in the mountains of Virginia, North Carolina, a Tennessee, accompanied by Mrs. Sidney Robertson Cowell. With a tape recording machine lent by the Library we recorded ninety-one songs and instrumental tunes, of which sixty-nine were from singers who had previously sung for Cecil Sharp or from near relations of these singers.I found, as I had been led to expect, that mountain life has been complete revolutionized during the last twenty to twenty-five years. Roads and electricity have brought ‘civilization’ to the mountains. The roads have made markets accessible and the people are now so busy making money in order to buy electric appliances and to improve the general material standard of life that they no longer have the leisure that they formerly possessed. The radio, which now operates in nearly every mountain home, has let loose a flood of ‘hilly-billy’ and other popular music, and this is gradually submerging the traditional song. Primary education is another force that is weakening the hold of tradition.Maude Karpeles

                            Arguably, however, the profoundest change is sociological and cultural. And in that respect, America changed more from 1964 to 1969 than it did from 1970 to 2019. All of that change was for the worse, needless to say.

        By now, most dissidents understand that we cannot either talk or vote our way of the mess we’re in. So I ask, can we educate our way out of the mess we’re in? My answer is no, we cannot. We have passed the tipping point in which too many idiots occupy space within the borders of the USA. Ditto for Europe. This malady is a direct consequence of being too affluent for too long and the concurrent death of evolutionary culling based on fitness selection. We dissidents are now just non-conformist ping pong balls being swept down the Mississippi River.If we continue as we are, Idiocracy is not our future, but an insect model is. There will be an elite class ruling over peon workers and enforcement drones. See Mexico as an example. And in this model, the only culling that will occur is with dissidents.NO, we must not roll over and acquiesce to this madness. But to win, we must be smarter; as evolution intends. A billion years of evolutionary biology gave us the antibody. We would be foolish to ignore that reality.

        For example, if what science tells us about male homosexuality is largely correct, then logically we should never permit male homosexuals to be around young males without strict supervision.

        “In other words, if the people with real power refuse to go where science about human nature must lead, then what is the point of knowing any of this? Further, there must be some material explanation for why people with heads full of oogily-boogily seem to rise to the top of liberal societies.”I think the point of knowing this is for that time when AINO and its deranged power structure no longer exist or have the power to impose their lunacy on everybody else. There’s nothing we can do about AINO. It’s psychological disorder is too profound to be cured. OTOH, when new states, including at least one ethnostate, emerge from AINO’s ashes, they can be built, in part, upon HBD knowledge. We, therefore, must vouchsafe and husband those truths.The question of why deluded loons rule the Western roost is more difficult. Part of it is surely force of will in the service of fanaticism (and these traits don’t require genius-level intelligence). The New Left, to its credit, set as its task taking over America’s nodes of information–education, media, culture and ultimately big business–and they did so by dint of monomania. Once they accomplished this task, they had in their hands the most powerful propaganda organ in the history of the human race. The rest was, as they say, all academic.Of course, there is a less materialistic and more metaphysical explanation. The New Left received an inestimable subvention from unclean forces. Hence the Satanic Inversion.

        You guys in these circles are fixated on IQ, but that’s only one component. Intelligence is a function of both nature and nurture. IQ without honing and training often isn’t going to test as well.Just a small example that’s not really IQ, but I think is applicable here. I took one of the graduate entrance exams. Now I’m just an immigrant kid. (Born in the USA and to legal parents, I might add.) I didn’t know all this stuff about taking review courses and any of that garbage. I just always walked into tests and did well. Not this time, though. I fell flat on my face. I think I got 40 percentile or something like that.Well, I got a little pissed. I said to myself, I may not be the sharpest tack, but I know I’m smarter than that. So I bought one of their review books and probably went through all the questions three or four times. Went into the test and knocked it out of the park. I’m MENSA material according to the results. (No, I didn’t join MENSA.)So, in a small way, this makes me suspect that a lot of the testing is biased just because people haven’t been trained in the proper skills to take these kinds of tests, including IQ tests. And who’s to say that you’re stupid just because maybe you are weak at reading. Maybe if they give you an IQ test that involves more active participation, you also knock it out of the park. Or maybe you just don’t know what they’re expecting out of you when they throw logic at you.Then we have other things going on like autism. Autistic people are whip smart or non-functioning vegetables.I’m not saying there aren’t variations in smarts, but like I said in the second sentence, it’s  both nature and nurture.Go ahead and downvote to your heart’s content.

That’s a fair concern, but it’s also an obvious one that any honest researcher is going to have cross his mind at some point and thus there has been a lot of work done on things such as A) IQ tests that don’t depend on pre-training, so aren’t biased in favor of test-taking skills, and B) Normalizing the results based on such skills.

            IQ is basically computing speed and power. It serves a purpose but is not the end all and be all of a person.  I agree, there is a fixation on IQ. Among some. But if this was an after school high school club it would be the Evolution Club.  I find all of that somewhat lacking but I find the people who make that an important part of their identity to be enjoyable and agreeable. So I bite my tongue sometimes.

            No, he says homosexuality might be 0.3 by genetics, so at best it’s kind of a forcing. Borderline cases might be tipped one way or the other by heredity. The majority is still environment, and, though I don’t have the book yet, might have some epigenetic forcing, too. If you have several elder brothers, because of the male hormones your mom “endured” bringing them to term, you might have a higher chance of homosexuality.
Waiting to see. The studies I’ve seen to date all have Briggsian Wee Ps, but Dutton isn’t a slouch — he’d likely have recognized that.

Correct. Consider, for example, the phenomenon of prison homosexuality and prison rape by men who would otherwise be attracted to women.

        There is a strong correlation between high-risk homosexual behaviors (read: bug chasing) and Toxoplasmosis infection, which begs the larger question whether some sort of parasitic infection drives homosexual behavior in general. There is no evolutionary advantage to homosexuality, so it should eventually die out, or at least become exceedingly rare, over generations. Instead, we see precisely the opposite, which indicates it is behavioral, not genetic.
Although I have to admit that the older I get I wish I were gay. Modern women are utterly impossible.

                With respect, I disagree. Outside of certain fields (government employment, fashion, working at Google, maybe advertising?) there is no advantage to being openly gay. Many young people, especially young women, go through a phase. I’m old, and even I know the term LUG (Lesbian Until Graduation). One of my daughters experimented openly in college, claiming to be bisexual. She is through that phase now, and exclusively dating men. My brother’s daughter is still claiming to be a lesbian but she just hates men, like her bi**h mom.My comment may have been more directed at men. Male homosexuality has more characteristics of compulsive behavior. They trend toward ever increasing risks, as if they can’t help themselves. It’s utterly self destructive, as if their behavior is being driven by an unknown parasite (and probably a lot of drugs). Ergo, the AIDS “epidemic”. I recall in the 80s or 90s reading an article about the AIDs epidemic spreading through bath houses in SF and NY and how men would have unprotected sex with a man who they know was infected from the sores on his body, but they just could not help themselves. Toxoplasmosis (or drugs) is the only explanation I can see.

                    Well, to put what you suggest more bluntly, homosexuality, particularly the male type, is a severe mental illness, and was, until fairly recently, recognized as such. This is why many heauxmeaux behaviors are completely irrational.
PS–Pomo philosopher Michel Foucault, in the early 80s, was infected with the disease later known as AIDS and he knew it. Nevertheless, he continued frequenting SF bathhouses and almost certainly infected many men with the disease, effectively sentencing them to death.

                    it’s hard to see how homosexuality could be an evolutionary advantage. But maybe it’s a case of excessive amounts of tendencies which are advantageous?male gays might be a case of excessive need to breed? Men are obviously built to be very pushy about getting laid. I would characterize the gays I’ve known as actually bi, or even “will screw anything that can’t outrun him”. Damn right they should not be allowed near boys, that’s the whole point of being anti-gay. Allowing openly gay men near boys means that boys activities will become unsafe for them – a lot like letting transmen compete against women: such allowances ruin those activities for legitimate participants.female gays might be excessive solipsism/ narcissim, which I think it’s a natural advantage for mothers to be very selfish about securing a safe and cushy nest, to hell with the costs to society in general

                Entire institutional sectors in America are now predominantly homosexual. And not just in “cultural” circles. If you meet someone in the US diplomatic corps, or who went to Yale, you can safely assume he’s gay.

            As Dutton has pointed out, ever since the Industrial Revolution, all sorts of dysgenic forces and people (the spiteful mutants, which includes pervs of every stripe) have waxed. Material largess has dampened evolutionary culling to a great degree, and this accounts for much of our current misery.

        Dutton sure uses a lot of “scare” quotes…Finished the first chapter, not bad, but he does three things that irritate the heck out of me.  First, he simply drops “Woke” in there (like the scare quotes?) with no discussion of what it is.  Second, he spends too much time defending himself as not being some sort of crypto-Nazi.  Why would you open that door?  Maybe he will get to that later.  Third, if religions are the result of adaptation, then liberalism (the people who lock shields and demand conformity) is a genetic adaptation as well.  Signaling is just another way of saying, “Breed with me.  We’re alike.”  So far, he has not accepted his conclusion or applied it to the New Religion.We’ll see how it goes with the rest of the book.  Maybe he’ll tackle some of this later on.

        I wasn’t exactly convinced by the review that the book is worth reading or skimming, but I decided to check Amazon for an inside look anyway. Oh my. The table of contents makes the book look immediately like a syllabus of Thoughtcrime. No wonder I didn’t find it on the websites of the public libraries of NYC, Chicago, and San Fran. It could make the regime go wobbly, if only there were some critical mass of rebels who are interested in developing a replacement culture.Better culture requires resolutely condemning and turning away from the errors of ancestors and forebears. Wrong, failed culture and religion such as American republicanism, Judeo-European capitalism, and Medieval European Christendom need not apply for the open position. Conservatism is crapservatism.Here are the chapter titles, which in the table are followed by section titles, some quite amusing:1: Why is Science So Badly Taught?2: Sex Differences3: Sexuality, Cliques and Bullying4: Race5: Social Class6: Physical Appearance7: Science Need Not Be DullSections include “Dysgenics and Social Class”, “Politics and Physiognomy”, and “Teaching As a ‘Girls’ Game&#x27;”.Maybe I’m too enthusiastic about the text, like when I first reada short story about womenas understood in India, too, more than 2000 years ago. Still, Dutton’s book is just 172 pages. A day’s reading, maybe two, for anyone who isn’t much distracted.

        “Further, there must be some material explanation for why people with heads full of oogily-boogily seem to rise to the top of liberal societies. Perhaps evolution does not care about empiricism as much as the fans of evolutionary biology insist.”
This video does a pretty good job of answering your objection.
The summary is that in the long run (mid to end of the century) liberalism is doomed

            I only watched the first couple minutes, but I am formulating a fairly long comment along the same line. The entire Earth is heading toward demographic collapse as fertility rates enter freefall. Our elites know this, which is why they are supporting mass immigration.People blame fertility collapse on the elites, but I don’t buy that. Elites suffer massively in eras of population collapse. It causes asset deflation and wage inflation, massively increasing the bargaining power of the working class at the expense of the societal elite. The bubonic plague was a huge win for the peasant class, at least those who did not die.The only groups who will survive are those who cling to traditional religious beliefs. It is the single indicator of fertility.

                Agreed, this is why we have to blame women lol.  Every institution is behaving more erratically because we’ve shoehorned women into every major decision. Even if no women are in the board room, the men can lose half of their net worth if their business or politics don’t align with their wives hormones

        Correction: the second largest factor contributing to the differences in most behavioral and psychological traits in adulthood are in fact not due to home environment after additive genetic factors. They are due to something we call non shared environment which compromises everything not shared within the same family, including measurement inaccuracies.

            I’ve seen a lot of the same conclusions. I’ve seen as much as 60% is determined by peer group. Which might be why @Zman said if the science was understood, you would never let gays, trannies, pedos, etc., within a gazillion miles of adolescents and pre-adolescents, because they will influence your kids.

To redeem the public schools I’d take every second “public educator” and publicly hang them as a warning to the others. Or I’d just skip to burning public schools down to the ground with the teachers locked inside. Public schools are hot houses for drugs, promiscuity and faggotry as well as toxic politics.

            Still waiting for you to disclose what you’ve gotten up to recently. Beaten down any minorities. Kidnapped an illegal beaner into the trunk of your car and took him back over the Rio Grande? Lullabied any LEOs / enforcers? No, nothing?
Just pecking away at the keyboard still innit? Waiting for everyone else to do something. Stop talking, you are a poser and a provocateur and I tire of your lame “do something” shtick while you comfortably sit your flabby ass in front of a screen.

                You should tell him the story about the one time you tried to be a man, and got your rear-end pounded out in prison.  How it made you the docile, compliant fem you now are.

        Humans naturally self-segregate and that is both natural and based in natural properties.And this, of course, is manifest and rudimentarily demonstrable malarky, and the fact that it is so simply disposed of pretty much illustrates the caliber of thesoi-disantintellectuals in the HBD-osphere. It is a fact universally acknowledged (my apologies, Ms. Austen) that wherever the male sex has sojourned in this world, he has put all his earnest efforts into consorting with the local females (of whom a few willing members could always be found), whatever race or color they happened to be. Thus, when it comes to the most intimate form of congregation, acting under the rawest and most natural of all the “natural properties,” the only color that really seems to matter is pink, and sovereign “biology” is satisfied, in this case, that they’re all pink on the inside.To attribute human social self-segregation to some inchoate biological imperative is the very height of goal-seeked nonsense. It is a clear example of HBDers talking their book when reality has weighed in decisively on the other side of the question. What they’ve actually proven by arguing in this inept manner is that the kind of race they are most interested in, meaning the kind of people they do not want to share the social space with, is, contrary to their incessant protestations, very mucha social construct.Prediction: There will be much junking of this post, but no effective counterargument to the point.

            Just because you go for a bit of native tail doesn’t mean you want hordes of Mau Maus and wogs shacking up next to you in Knightsbridge or the 5th arrondissement.

                Chasing tail and/or “making do” with what is available is a far different thing than an intentional commitment when options are available.  The data available from dating apps shows strong in-race preferences across all groups although some are stronger than others.
Simply observing your environs displays a similar selection bias. That the rare adventurous explorers were adventurous in other aspects is hardly surprising. And they remain the exception rather than the rule.
