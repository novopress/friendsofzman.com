        There’s no doubt the US and the west in general are headed down the craphole.  The apparent insanity of the leadership as well as significant percentages of the populations seems to bear this out.  No way this republic/empire makes it 500 years without a massively cleansing fire…

        I newly discovered Derb and am much comforted by his views which are mine; delighted that he not only knew about the Habsburg Empire but mildly favored it. I am particularly fond of its cultural aspects, obsessively even, but find few to share these inclinations with …

            I would love to know more about the Hapsburg era.
Was that the Austro-Hungarian Empire?(Ah!  Derb just anwered my question.)
I believe that’s where Michael Hudson pointed out the invention of the income tax, that is, making the nation responsible for the king’s war loans.  Much history and economics ensued.

            To quote Derb from an article he posted in NRO in 2012:‘In Berlin the situation is serious but not desperate; in Vienna, the situation is desperate but not serious.” This quip was heard around Central Europe in the closing days of both world wars, but certainly predates 1918. Political scientist Paul Gottfried, my go-to guy on mattersMitteleuropäisch, thinks it originated with one of the late-Habsburg Hungarian statesmen — Andrássy or Tisza. The point of the quip is to show the different outlooks of Prussians and Austrians: the first soldiering on to the end in dogged hope, the second in fatalistic acknowledgment that while the curtain may indeed be about to fall, there is no point forgoing life’s normal pleasures in the interim.Indeed, there was a comic opera vibe to the Austro-Hungarian Empire in its last decades, which is captured in several novels, such as Joseph Roth’sThe Radetsky March, Jaroslav Hasek’sThe Good Soldier Zwejk, Miklos Banffy’sTransylvania Trilogy, and most famously Kafka’sThe Trial. Another book very much worth one’s time is Stefan Zweig’s memoirThe World of Yesterday.

        kamala was asked by Anderson Cooper if Trump was a fascist and she said yes. Given two prior assassination attempts this is reckless, and it sounds to me like she wants him dead. There are enough unhinged people out there that will take that charge seriously and she knows it. We are really moving into dangerous territory. Or it’s possible she is so dumb she doesn’t know what a fascist is.

            “Fascist” is just another slur like “racist” which means a subhuman whom it is acceptable to destroy.
The Left/Globocap are monsters that lack the ability to see the plank in their own eye.  These “champions of democracy” are among the most tyrannical and vicious people to ever live.  Anyone who objects to being ruled by them is a “fascist.”

        Happy 29000 indeed, Derb (though I guess it’s 29002 as I write this). Nice to know I’m not the only one who keeps track of his age in days (27488 for me today). It lets me amuse myself with telemarketers; most of them ask my age since they’re selling Medicare plans or life insurance.

        I’m only 24600 days old. I didn’t realize you were that old, Mr. Derbyshire. I hope my faculties are as good as yours if I see 29k. Here’s wishing you make it to 36500 and then some with ease.

        1) Trump will be an obstacle to the 2nd Pandemic.
2) Kamala, the granddaughter of Rhodesia’s destroyers, will pull off the 2nd Pandemic without hesitation or thought.
3) Biden was simply the trojan horse to get Kamala in.
Kamala is the granddaughter of PV Gopalan, the right-hand man to Kenneth Kaunda and Robert Mugabe/Joseph Nkomo;
Kaunda, Mugabe, and Nkomo were the Communists who tore Rhodesia apart, creating Kaunda’s Zambia (North Rhodesia) and Zimbabwe (South Rhodesia) under Mugabe and Nkomo.(deleted: the Organizers, with USSR backing. Yes, Every Single Time, both Rho &amp; S.A.)

            It’s hard to say how things will play out.
It’s possible that a 2nd Trump term will be used to push digital ID under the guise of tracking and controlling the illegals to protect the children.

        Elsewhere, at a clandestine blog I frequent, was what I think is a relatively cogent observation on the 2020 vote rigging. The common conspiracy aficionado g3li3r (sorry, fingers not on home row…) belief is that such voter fraud is directed from the top down. It’s an instance of the generalized belief that most of the world’s ills are hatched by an all-powerful secret cabal, e.g. of elderly billionaire Jews in their underground bunker, perhaps underneath a famous Swiss resort, or was it inside a hollowed-out volcano a la James Bond movies? [Adjust details to taste as you like] A much more realistic, albeit pedestrian and boring, explanation is that a lot of the evils of the world are best attributed to good old human greed, sloth and stupidity. After that brief digression, let’s return to voting irregularities, shall we? Anyway, the unnamed author’s sage opinion was that in 2020 much of the fraud was local volunteers, bottom-up if you like, doing what they thought was best to help their favored candidate(s) get elected.We’re expecting a repeat this year, on steroids.California humor [rated “R” for a dirty word, please don’t click if you would be offended]

        If the count is close run, with Trump apparently the winner, Kamala could suddenly acquire a reputation as a great American stateswoman by conceding the race to him and refusing to support any Dem lawfare against him. Fat chance, I suspect, but maybe somebody should whisper it in her ear.  After all she must be well aware that she’s not remotely up to the job of President.My prediction: Trump will win the election but Kamala will win the count.My alternative prediction is that the Dems will assassinate Kamala, jail Trump for it, and retain The Vegetable as President “temporarily”.

            Here’s a hypothetical-
What if they cheat Trump in, then turn around and admit it AND come up with a mountain of detailed, credible evidence that causes the courts to rule against Trump so Kamala can be installed?
Then the media can screech, “Look everyone! The system still works great!”

        Derb mentions the nontrivial possibility of a government-sponsored Trump assassination. I think they would hesitate. Once they go the hitman route, they’re opening Pandora’s Box and they know it. If one side kills for political reasons, then *both* sides kill for political reasons. There’s a real reticence to taking the gloves off.
