        The Old Totalitarianism was a product of masculine society. Shoot the dissident in the back of the head; throw the corpse in the ditch; cover it with a bulldozer. Next victim.The New Totalitarianism is a product of feminized society. As any guy who has ever gone through a bad divorce or break-up knows, it’s all about the drama: gaslighting, lying, manipulating, blame-shifting, projection, gossiping, rumor-spreading, faux victimization, calling the cops, restraining orders, “I’m afraid of him,” “He hit me,” and on and on and on. Endlessly. If “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,” just look at the reaction of the Democrats to Hillary’s loss in 2016: lies about Trump being a stooge of the Russians, the fake sex dossier, the FBI/NSA spying operation, the prosecution of his associates, the fake impeachment, and on and on for four fucking years.Pelosi, Harris, Klobuchar and AOC aren’t going to line people up and have them shot. They’re going to get their panties in a bunch and never stop pissing, moaning, bitching, carping, whining, crying and hysterically shrieking about white supremacy and misogyny and racism and gender identity and they’ll henpeck the white man into submission with a thicket of “woke” rules and regulations and bullshit like the Lilliputians tying up Gulliver with a thousand threads.

Couldn’t agree more. You can tell the health of a society based on the relationship between its men and women. Obviously we live in a mortally sick society. Until we return to traditional gender roles, and become more masculine, we are doomed.
It starts with each one of us and how we conduct ourselves and raise our families. Long term we need to return to a hierarchical system, and create honor based values and rules.

            This is why it will never end until women are removed from power positions.From a male point of view it looks like an insanity that will burn itself out eventually.However, it is really just how most women think (for wont of a better term). For them it is not crazy at all.We are just living in this mindset being externalized into the power structures. You see the same thing happen in every sphere women gain entry into.

        For the army of the woke, the suffering of the victim and the fame for inflicting that suffering is what matters.Lest anyone think this doxing just happens to the other guy, to famous rich people like the My Pillow guy, learn that it can happen to anyone.After my doxing, my self-righteous, a woke customer of mine researched and contacted my other customers, even old customers, some of which they didn’t even know! A cabal of my customers organized to sign a symbolic, phony legal letter meant solely to intimidate me, spread my infamy abroad, and humiliate me.Imagine the above: people that did not know each other, and were brought together solely to destroy me! I was their rallying cry!A volunteer organization in which I spent HOURS a month helping people,  got wind that I was a racist, and kicked me out of their organization not for violating any rule. But their lawyers send me an intimidating letter that said that my presence would “disrupt” and make others uncomfortable. This was a volunteer position!I had done nothing but GOOD for these cunts. I NEVER talked politics in front of them, even when THEY would bring it up. I was nothing but professional in all my dealings, professionally and in the volunteer job.I may not be able to work in my profession again, something I have dedicated decades to, and am very good at. Heck, I may never be able to work a job that requires a reputation.This shit is real as a heart attack. I found out the hard way.   Wokeness, or whatever the hell is going on now, is demonic and sadistic. If ya’ll have kids, wake THEM up to the dangers. Theses people do not play, (BLM/ADL/ANTIFA) and it is their pleasure and costs them nothing to set traps and create permanent, online WANTED posters of you.These are not people that can be reasoned with. They seem driven with a religious fervor that needs public venting. They are the enemy of goodness.

            So how have your responded? Beyond your summary of the warning (which I appreciate), did you respond with any pressure on the culprits? In real life, I mean?If my ability to feed my children is destroyed by someone, why should they not realize the consequences? Asking for a friend.

            Whether you like it or not, you have now become a modern day ronin, and you can and should fight back with righteous justification. One way (as here) is to spread the word of your personal experience and help others to avoid falling into the same trap. But there are others means as well. You would do well to convert your anger into as many alternative solution methods as you’re able. Cast off your victimhood and act.

                        Well no. The cat can’t physically kill the dog but it’s instinct is to claw it right on the nose, which for a dog is like getting booted in the fork multiplied.Saw a video once of a cat who had been corned by three coyotes who just started smacking noses and the coyotes stopped wanting to play.

                            We had one cat that was cornered by the three vicious dogs that our back neighbor routinely let roam her yard.  They killed her, but apparently all three had to taken to the vet to be sewn up.  Since they used to routinely terrorize kids in our neighborhood it afforded me the pleasure of letting the owner know that even under NY law (oddly farmer friendly) I was entitled to shoot them if ever found in my yard.

            When restaurants open, the 25% will be ignored in most of the suburban / rural areas away from the capital.  Even here in NJ, restaurants in the little towns around me operate at maybe 25% – of their standing or fire-code capacity.  Basically the tables have been moved slightly farther apart.  And people wear a mask into the gym, then immediately remove it because who would exercise with a face cover?It’s good because people are being conditioned to ignore the idiotic ruling class.

                Small operators can get away with ignoring the rules until they want to make an example out of someone.  Then they come in and crush you.  Minnesota has been threatening to pull liquor licenses from rural bars and restaurants that opened in violation of their shutdowns.

                in brooklyn, the restaurants that are still in business have all built shacks in the street (where the parking spots used to be) as “outdoor” dining. most of them are completely enclosed, so they’re no different from indoor dining, except you get to freeze your ass off.

                    The gym down the street decided one day to hold one of their yoga classes all over the sidewalk I need to use to get to my car.  I made a point of walking right through them while others were walking out into the street.  Of course it didn’t hurt that it was a typical bunch of useless UMC white wammen doing their version of outdoor ghetto twerking.  God I hate these bitches.

        As more and more businesses close around here, I see more and more of the Bezos fleet driving around. It looks like he’s taking over the world, but each one of those drivers is probably silently humming the old Johnny Paycheck song in his head (Bezos, unlike UPS or USPS, does a lot to alienate his workforce). Even if they replace those drivers with bots, the ones who really make those bots work will be white guys. They won’t be “our” guys, and will be mostly the ponytailed libertarian white guys who look like Styx, but they’ve still got brains and an axe to grind most of the time and will only allow themselves to be pushed so hard. I’m not saying do nothing, but I am saying that if you really look around and listen, it seems to all outward appearances that you’re doing nothing while you’re taking in quite a bit. In Vietnam, the subservient Mama San smiling and Yassah-ing as she washed GI laundry was sharpening punji sticks every night in her little hut after she went home. Being the underdog and the outsider can suck, but you can make it fun, too.

            If the My Pillow Man is to be believed, he was a victim of a variation of the Fake Account Syndrome. Mike Lindell claimed that once locked out of his Twitter account, it was accessed internally and tweeted pro-junta memes, the best I understand his claim. Social media is on it’s way down so efforts will be made to coerce usage for the reasons you cited.I differ somewhat with your analysis. We have an interesting divorce taking place, and parallel societies forming. It drives the totalitarian to even more extremes and forced participation will be one aspect. Forcible voting may be attempted as people refuse to participate in the fraud, as happens in Australia  now. Vlacek Havel nailed it years ago: live as if you are free. In an illegitimate, vicious system, that is solid advice.

Oddly, I think the numerous Indian tech workers around here would get the joke and actually approve. They would probably smile and think “here’s at least one white guy who gets it.It’s not that they didn’t support Harris/Biden but they knewwhy.  No false consciousness there.

                Yes. Australia does have compulsory voting. But that doesn’t mean you have to vote. As long as you attend a polling venue and have your name crossed off the roll, you can lodge an ‘informal’ vote, if you want. Instead of numbering the squares (we have a ‘preferential’ system here) you can write something like “None of the above is acceptable”. Our Constitution and the Electoral Office are silent on what would happen if a majority of ballots were invalid and it’s never happened. But I do wonder what the authorities woul do if such a circumstance were to occur.

                    It occurs to me that compulsory voting would really curtail election fraud because you’d know in advance the exact number of visits you’d receive per voting district, and you’d know the maximum number of votes a candidate could receive as well.

            Recently I’ve found myself feeling almost enthused about what’s happening, because I keep feeling these minor thrills when I consider the gloves are off.  If you’re inclined to have a little fun, and you do it smartly (which only increases the satisfaction), this is a great time to be alive.

                    Not giving a shit about a lot of things that used to waste my energy is nice.  Sportball, patriotic crap, support for the military/police, getting angry about red/blue team nonsense, caring about taxes and the economy from a libertarian/fairness perspective, worrying about foreign affairs, etc.   It’s as much an attitude thing as actively throwing sand in the gears.  The sand will come naturally.

                        Same. Its liberating once you realize this isn’t our country anymore. And as such is merely a location, an economic opportunity to build wealth for the chilrens. One doesn’t fight for such a location anymore than ((())) would take up a rifle and join the (US) Army. As for the mass immigration, the systemic racism and the rest of the mayhem created by the increasingly fascist cloudies- the only question one asks is ”How can I profit from this?”  When the universe of what you care about, and what you’re willing to fight for is downsized to me, family, tribe then hope and optimism are restored. You cant save the country. But you might save your family, maybe your Nation.

            And this proclivity exists because it works. Corrosion is ubiquitous and relentless, and extremely difficult to stamp out. Yes, the Jackboots will kill off a few peons in the public square in an attempt to frighten everyone else into submission, but then a new form of corrosion arises somewhere else and it too is much more severe. Evolutionary escalation back &amp; forth, and Civil war by attrition. But Jackboots can only kill, not grow their own food.

                    Something like that. Our vibrant security agents were looking very excited to get to boss white people around in the COVID lines. Glaring at the customers and directing them forcefully. They love having power of whites.
When the cops go to shut down non-compliance businesses in Toronto, almost all the cops are smug looking non-whites. They’re getting a taste of what they want.
They do hate us all, bad or good white, I’m sure they would be more than happy to open fire on us if asked to do so.

        &gt;  To the contrary, they hope the victim will cry out in agony and make his misery into a long-drawn-out public performance. They revel in seeing the victim moan about how his PayPal was deleted or how he lost his job. For the army of the woke, the suffering of the victim and the fame for inflicting that suffering is what matters.Which is why the right needs to stop whining on social media.  It just feeds the monster and makes them look weak.  If someone loses their job, you find him a new job and fund his family during the transition, quietly.

                I think its fair to say the right’s own performance art is whining about how unfair the world is regarding the tech garbage. They get a thrill out of it. You’re not a serious person if you get off on owning the libs with their hypocrisy and MUH FREE SPEECH. We get it.

No doubt. There’s got to be more than a few white men, shoved out of their defence job (perhaps for Pajeet) that could take up the mantle.
The wife and I watched it the other day. I think we laughed our heads off at the ‘Nazi Santa Claus’ in the skinhead’s basement.

Start killing off Gulf drilling and all the refit work for rigs and you’ve got a lot of pissed off people whose skills probably include driving rifles reliably at 500 yards.

        It’s Witch Trial Syndrome. When the PTB can’t recognize, let alone manage, a cultural sea change, they persecute witches. It burns itself out once the PTB themselves start getting accused (in Salem, the governor’s wife). It took a little over a year in 1692; given modern information velocity (and the Special Needs Toddlers’ clear determination to go all in right away) I give it no longer than that.

            I think Trump is going to be laughing like a loon in the days ahead, and will be thankful he was ousted. As our esteemed host is fond of saying, these are the good ol’ days. When the foreclosures start, the food banks and flop houses and soup kitchens become our major industries – it will be Mutiny On The Bounty – especially for our leaders.

                    Covid stimmies may now be seen as an entitlement. What happens when they’re cut off? Then again, the AWRs are also making noises about guaranteed incomes, so perhaps those will take the place of the stimmies. We’re through the looking-glass, which means that no form of fiscal malpractice is off the table.

                Remember that Versailles was created out of wilderness after the monarchy had formerly resided in Paris.
I have to wonder if things get too hairy in DC whether the government won’t relocate itself to a safe zone.  Perhaps somewhere protected by natural barriers, etc.
or will they just go down with a burning ship ?

                    I think Versailles was more-or-less the attempt by the monarchy to reset, rather like Constantine abandoning Rome for a new city he named after himself. An early version of draining the swamp, if you will – finding the swamp un-drainable, the only alternative might be to start a new swamp.
The critters of the swamp will never choose to leave it.

                    They’re still buying up everything in Martha’s Vineyard, despite the fact that their nonprofits say it will be underwater due to global warming soon enough. Maybe they’re all planning on “transitioning” to mermen and naiads. Speaking of our rich elite and their wonderful charities, did you see where the bigwig at Apollo had to resign because he paid Epstein something like 150 million  in “consultancy fees”? That’s steep for blackmail, but if you can afford Edvard Munch’s “Scream” you can probably afford it.

                    Burning ship. They need the symbols of power that fill up DC. Underground bunkers are not an option for them because the Elites can only sit on the throne, not actually lead, and the throne of ‘Murica is bolted down in DC.
It’s why they tore down our statues to replace with their own. They’re that dependent on symbolic power.

                        I think a great move for our team would be to move en masse to around DC and just live our lives there quietly.  It would freak them out knowing that at any time the beast could awaken.
In fact I am looking for a place around DC.  A lot of it our of pure curiosity to see how they live.  Plus I like the landscape of Virginia.

            Paul Ramsey has a good take on what’s going on:The far left defined themselves through their opposition to the bad old Orange Man (TM); they were “the resistance” fighting the man. But they are the man, they are the bad guys and they always were. Pretending otherwise was the only way they could rationalize their hypocrisy as the oppressor. Since Trump is gone, they’re left with nothing to sustain this fiction — no identity of their own outside of hate — so they are lashing out in an attempt to get their hate mojo back.This is the end result of a multicultural empire with no common bonds — no loyalty to the national interest and a constant need for a boogeyman to validate their existence and provide fraternity with others in this bleak era.

One small red pill…I met a couple last night who was completely red pilled on the beer flu.  They were probably 10-15 years my junior but they were disgusted by our rulers and their reaction to the virus.
I tried not to get too excited and data dump my dissident thoughts on them but I did encourage them on their journey to the dark side.

My instinct when the “white privilege” thing started was to double down on it.  So I started dressing well or better than I normally do, making sure to be well groomed, showing a quiet resolve in public
You should see their faces lol.  It was both anger and awe and ended up as respect

                    Well, it had a lot of help. After it was becoming clear that communism was not working you had the death of Lenin then the power struggle to replace him. Then followed Stalin consolidating his power then the run up to the war and then the war itself. You had about 30 years of things happening that prevented the system from following its logical arc. What we thing=k of of communism did not last a full human lifetime. If you were 20 years old when Stalin died, you were a middle aged man when the system collapsed.In reality it lasted less than 60 years and half of that was consumed by events outside the revolution.

                    Depends on when you mark the start of it. I’d argue no later than the mid 60s, trending that way a long time before that.  Heck maybe this is what America was fated to become.

        Mostly off topic: Has anyone else notice the buyers’ remorse in the Biden voting crowd? “I didn’t vote for this!” seems to be their refrain.This is the world they voted for, now they get to live in it. The mighty ship of state has had its course corrected in short order, and cruises at full steam. Are there icebergs about?

                They foolishly thought the far-left could be talked off their woke ledge and that Joe Biden would embrace populism and heal the country by being a moderate on economics. They reasoned Trump was the reason they were deplatformed and their statues were torn down, and they thought with him gone that would change. A certain Huey Long loving internet blogger I’m familiar with is losing his shit as Biden screws up, refusing to take his and Richard Spencer’s good advice on how to run the country.Pure folly. As I’ve pointed out before, absolute power corrupts absolutely. The only thing that restrains violence is the threat of reciprocal violence; that’s why mobs form &amp; mass looting suddenly starts when the threat of policing wanes. Now that the woke Left has absolute power, the mask is off and they are free to be as evil as their hearts desire with no threat of punishment for their crimes.Science shows us that the far Left is more likely to be manipulative, fanatical and hypocritical … and they are in charge of everything now. There is no reason for these people to compromise with you when they can simply enforce their will through violence, political and even kinetic — especially since they are predisposed to those things anyway. There will be no one to hold them accountable for their monstrous crimes, so they do not feel the need to heal anything or to check their excesses. Things aren’t going back to the way they once were.

Anyways, welcome to hell. This is the normal and has been for quite some time.
Normal literally cannot come back, as “normal” was only possible in a white supermajority, Christian and Anglo Saxon – derived society. That’s gone now. What we’re seeing is the present taking root.

                        It’s a good point. These people bring their neighbourhoods down – and we say they look like crap. But considering where they came from, it all seems to make sense.Years ago, my landlord at the time told me of the problems he’d had with the former tenant – an African who slept on a mattress on the floor. The place was filthy, but then again, to someone who may well have escaped becoming a child soldier, various exotic diseases and had to negotiate African cities I am sure it was like the Hilton.Look! running water! Look! Reliable electricity! Look! Reliable buses and trains! Of course, all these things would fall under the category of white supremacy.

            I was at a thing this morning where the 7 people to arrive first were all white men- no women yet, I mentioned that this was thus  a group of bigoted racists and explained the Biden Regime teaching Critical Race Theory. My closing line was that this bullshit wouldn’t effect me much but was likely to make life harder for my son and that meant that anybody who voted for Biden was my enemy and I was going to do what I could to each and every one of them.There was general agreement with one exception who had the sense to keep his mouth shut.

        I have a client that has barely left her house since March, everything is delivered she also has imprisoned her teenage daughter and her husband. I would have divorced her by now and taking the child. Anyway,  she’s gotten the vaccine and she is still not going to leave her house. It does not matter with these people. We need to hope for Bronze Age collapse part 2

            If the vaccine is as dangerous as some say and we can keep it from being made mandatory… I’ll admit I can sometimes see tptb’s point of view, though I wouldn’t want to answer for it.

                An untrialled genetic experiment that permanently alters human DNA to protect against a mutating virus with a 99.7% survival rate, promoted by outspoken depopulation advocates?? Yeah, it’s just a vaccine. Think about it. It is not a vaccine in the traditional sense, yet they enjoy liability immunity for any bad that comes of it. Who would not take advantage of this great opportunity to simply use the global population to trial many varieties of genetic splicing, “enhancement”, time  bombs, targeting, etc.? How uch of the “testing” has simply been DNA collection??

        I am glad you mentioned the covid nonsense. That’s what immediately came to mind for me. Especially the masks.If someone wants to look like a fool and go around with their face covered for no effective reason (because a facemask doesn’t prevent viral spread), I have no problem with it. But my problem IS with being told that I also have to look like a fool, if only because it calms the fears of the dumbasses around me. Masks are just a symbol of submission and compliance to the narrative at this point.There is an essay by Vaclav Havel (“The Power of the Powerless”) that explains that the point of totalitarianism is to atomize the individual and prevent them from realizing that there are other people who disagree. He used the analogy of a shopkeeper who was expected to put a “Workers of the World Unite!” sign in his window. Not because he agreed with it, but because it was an effective means of humiliating him and the others around him into spreading a message that they didn’t want to.Propaganda isn’t meant to convince the believers, because they don’t need to be convinced. Nor is it meant to convince the disbelievers, because they can’t be convinced. The real purpose of propaganda is to humiliate the dissidents and force them into despair.Same thing with the masks. They are the 2020 (now 2021) equivalent of Havel’s “Greengrocer’s Sign”. This is being made even more clear this week as expectations are being disseminated that now you have to look even more ridiculous by putting TWO “I’m stupid” signs over your face. If you don’t do it, you are a terrible person.Highly recommend that people on this side go read that essay. It’s available online and is very illuminating when you think about all of the nonsense – covid, boys pretending to be girls, Washington DC melodrama – in the media these days.

            Yes. The wearing of the mask – and the entire tranche of rules around it – does seem to be an exercise in humiliation. I suspect that many people who don’t like wearing the mask, but are afraid to lose it, get annoyed at those who ‘act out’ because they themselves lack the courage to do the same. My goodness, that what it takes now for ‘courage’; not to wear a mask! Mind you, we also live in a time of ‘illegal’ children’s birthday parties.

        I must say, regarding the Covid madness, as I am up in the capital of The Isles today, I have been maskless. Everywhere I have been. I have greeted store assistants with a smile and enquired as to business: nice chats were the results. Who knows, maybe they thought it nice to speak to a non-droid like entity.

                    Notice that while you get the stank eye, nobody actually *does* anything. “Sir, masks are required to enter this store.” “Oh, okay”… he says, walking right past them and getting on with his shopping, maskless. On the very rare occasions someone tries to enforce it, I say ” I have a disability” and walk away, getting on with my shopping. Let THEM try to figure out the risks of kicking a “disabled” guy out of their public accommodation (and yes, I’m really looking forward to unleashing my inner Karen when one of them dares to ask me which disability.

        You are crushing it these days with your writing at least!  Might be that your “prison notebooks” turn out to be your best writing.  I have read a lot about the Gulags lately, several books anyway, and the main thing to note is that they were in fact very pleasant prison camps for socialists and anarchist enemies of the communists immediately after the revolution, where people could read books and hang out in mixed gender settings that were a lot like a college dorm.  Totalitarians have the problem that they will apply their power towhoever is nearest to them and easiest to catch.The Czarist white russian armies were far from being easy to catch or boss around.  Ultimately the gulags developed into the nightmarish labor camps in the frozen arctic mainly because of the fact that it was a way of generating raw materials that the Communist party elite could sell for cold hard cash.  Basically, the communists invented a slave system for their leadership to use to get money.  Unlike American slavery, the communist leadership had zero investment in the people enslaved so they had no reason to help them or keep them healthy.  American Plantations at least had doctors for slaves because slaves were very expensive and it wasn’t good business to just have them keel over all the time.  Gulags just enslaved new people whenever they were low on workers.  So there never was a real “ideological” reason for why you were put in a gulag in Russia.  They would just arrest crowds of men on the street sometimes because they needed labor. Our new totalitarians are motivated by a sort of racial retribution, so they want to make us into low status males for the enjoyment of feminists and non-white people.  The whole point is to make a public spectacle of our humiliation to confirm their power.  So, we are living in a time where, unlike gulags or death camps, our overlords have no end in mind at all other than to watch us suffer.  As long as we have no status, and they can lord it over us that we have no status, they are content to just watch us suffer forever because they want to be “over” someone else in the power structure.

            Yes to all of this, but inevitably the Alphas will fight back (the days of quietly forming queues at the gas chamber door are long gone) and no tyranny can survive without Jackboots to enforce their edicts. That is the modern gambit; pit Patriot militias against LEOs and foster mutual decimation of the Alphas on both sides. But we don’t have to play that game. There is a better option, and focus is the key to success.

                I dunno.  Other than the absolutely hilarious dude in the horns taking a selfie in Congress on the 6th, nobody seems to be fighting back at all to be honest.

                    “nobody seems to be fighting back”Yes, exactly and correctly. From the shadows only, leave no trace, don’t get caught. Best yet, if time-delayed and no one notices. If your truck axle is corroding, you likely won’t notice it until it breaks.

        The Cat &amp; Dog Analogy fits well into this recurring topic of being ruled by Gynarcho-Tyrannical Feminism. Cat by nature is feminine, dog by nature is masculine.The cat like behavior is passive aggressive. Inflicting torments, social shame, ostracization, being ‘outside the group’. These are incredibly feminine behaviors so of course our “betters” wish to inflict them.The other examples provided of more muscular historical regimes fit the Dog / Masculine motif. Problem (person), solution (bullet). Move on to next logical step…It is unfortunate because if we had more masculine dog like enemies this entire thing would come to a head much more quickly. Where I’ll disagree is the last paragraph, re: the unsustainability of feminized passive clown world.This passive cat like toying can go on in perpetuity basically until a strong man appears (probably a radical muzz infiltrator) who will start to implement more ahh, ‘direct’ methods of reeducation. It is only then we will see who will get on the boxcars or against the wall as directed and who attempts to push back and die on their feet.

            The thing about pitbulls seizing power from plucky passive aggressive pussies is that there is no telling what happens when actual masculinity is displayed as unapologetic aggression-aggression.Legitimizing this power via overt masculinity will have its own set of consequences indeed. A cascade perhaps.As polarity begins to reverse it is always sloppy but it will reach a point when suddenly the slumbering and sedated hindbrain of a latte of males will awaken.The macro of a strong independent womyn adopting a pit bull puppy comes to mind. So misunderstood those gentle pups.The TBD of course is whether it will simply open her neck over a bowl of mislaid kibble or if it will eat the three kids in the apartment next door because no extreme of myopic matriarchy can uncurl a double helix.Much like the coal toll of the great new blackdeal, its not whether or not it gets paid but rather who ends up paying and when.A few generations of suppression and repression culminating in peak absurdities of clown world are but a few seconds on the genetic clock of men.Our culture has strapped men in rocking chairs and locked them in a room full of cats. When men stop apologizing, maybe thats a sign.I am quite tedious of all the poosy footin around these fake and gay hierarchies. I know I am far from alone in this.But unlike our femme zoo keepers, my optimism is growing thin.

                I had to evict a tenant last year, single girl with a pit bull.  I shouldn’t have even let her move in, but live and learn. After the thing bit an insurance agent inspecting my new roof it was sayonara.  And of course I got umpteen tear-filled choruses of “he’s really sweet!”

                    Modern AWFLs have lost their danger sense to a large degree due to several generations of living in gilded safety bubbles. This is why you see the ‘refugees welcome’ idiot blond women in Sweden who later end up getting savaged by rape apes. Ditto for the ‘backpackers’ that go to Morocco only to have their necks opened by a misunderstood jihadi wielding a ~Blade of Peace~. The list goes on and on. Pitbulls are another symptom of this syndrome. The best outcome as I’ve said before would be immediate consequences for poor decisions like the pitbull gnawing their faces off.I’m becoming more convinced as times goes on that if you gave women everything they wanted (we are nearly there) they would destroy society and themselves utterly and then b-tch about men causing it all.

            You are about to see how fake and gay our “free market system” is. The Lil’ Hats will claim they are being targeted because of their ethnicity and Congress will respond to make it a crime to foil shorts on the basis of ethnicity. When people start to go after Chinese concerns on the same basis, expect the same.
Whether for profit or whatever reason, this was freaking brilliant. A millions cuts such as this one can cause the system to implode.

There’s more to a share’s price than volume, and I’m certain that just as many insiders stood to benefit as to lose.I expect this to be the beginning of a round of market regulations designed to limit Joe’s potential profit on the stock market.

        Pinochet had a simple rule.  Don’t be a Commie.  Otherwise, no problems.  Many years ago had to work on an evaluation of all my firms SA businesses.  The only two that did’nt suck were Chile and Columbia.  Chile because of a growing economy and reliable rule of law (Pinochet).  Columbia b/c of remarkably large middle class of consumers for our products.  Recommended selling the Venezuela business, significantly reducing Brazil and limiting Argentina to a single product line, denominated in dollars.  See a theme?  Was interesting to see some poor literary agent got canceled for joining Parler and Gab, only to post a single solicitation for manuscripts on each–no politics.  Another rule change. Seems to have backfired.

        The biggest fear of our masters is that we pick up our marbles and go home. They need us – both as playthings to satisfy their moral preening and as worker bees to keep the system running.We have absolutely no need for them. Indeed, we are far, far better off without them.They came to power through propaganda, but that is quickly losing its potency. They will hold on to power through threats of destroying a person’s life, but that only works if we have no home base. If whites manage to form their own communities that protect them, it’s game over for TPTB – and they know it.

            There’s an old saw that basically says “A law that is flouted/ignored by around 10% of the population becomes unenforceable”…I wonder what percentage of the population needs to check out on this social media regime to cause its deflation?
Look, somewhere north of 40% of the public believes and KNOWS the election was bullshit.  Look at the inauguration and the media coverage; these guys aren’t confident.  Propaganda needs to be subtle to work.

                Whites need an alternative. Right now, they have to play by the Progressives’ rules because it’s the only game in town. Show whites a community where whites are openly proud of who they are, have friends and businesses that don’t crap on them, and you’ll see a mass exodus.
Of course, that is why TPTB will do everything in their power to stop such communities forming, which is why they need to form quietly. Then when the system starts to lose its ability to function very well, those communities come out of the shadows.

                Prohibition is a great example. I still can’t believe they were dumb enough to commit the Federal Government to policing private behavior, but there it was. It was absolutely unenforceable, as everyone but the goofs who voted for it saw at the time, and it made FedGov look both overweening and incompetent – they couldn’t even get Capone for Volstead Act violations; they had to get him on income tax evasion (itself only deemed constitutional two decades before, in 1913). Mass exodus from social media — or, better yet, mass reportage of the Kommissars for making us “uncomfortable” — would crash the whole system overnight.

            Already checked out. Work my cube monkey job with minimum effort, get paid. I don’t buy much stuff, no debt. I certainly don’t eat out at third world fast food joints or Uber Eats / Uber which is a welfare program for vibrants. I only help people out from my own tribe. I redpill people and point young guys in the right direction.
Young guys are totally checked out. If not in the basement playing video games, they’re on drugs. The guys with “careers” like me do the minimum work to get by and alot of grifting. Nobody cares anymore.

                        Central KY has multiple counties that are 98%+ white. Land and houses are cheap (relatively speaking). There’s even a decent-sized Amish community in Hart county, near Munfordville. Elizabethtown is pretty, affordable and has a low cost of living while being traditionally conservative, orderly and offers most of the modern conveniences people are used to. Masks aren’t commonly worn.

        This is a rare instance in which I disagree with the Zman’s conclusions. The stolen election of 2020 represents the beginning of what is going to be a decades-long slide into left-wing totalitarianism. The only thing that stops it is a kinetic, corrective action by the right.The initial wave of executive action and crackdowns is, to use a Bush-era metaphor, more like a shock and awe campaign designed to demonstrate who is in charge and to intimidate the opposition into submission. The next steps will be more calculated, tactical efforts to concentrate power in the Executive branch. Schumer has already suggested that Biden declare a Climate Emergency so he can rule by fiat under emergency powers, which I expect him to do after the next natural disaster event. The courts will do nothing of significance to stop it.By 2024 the Democrats will hold a significant majority in the House and will secure a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, which is when the real game starts. Tax rates will soar and retirement assets will be subjected to confiscatory taxation in the name of retirement equity. By this time I suspect most people will be far too conditioned to raise any material opposition.Biden’s not lying when he said dark days are ahead. Best to prepare now. I’m focusing on ways to get assets out of the country and to get a second passport.

            As Z has said, it looks like the endgame is corporate fiefdoms. Yet business never created a state. That takes legitimate force, law, culture— all the things being undermined to create a blob of helpless consumers. I can’t see how it doesn’t collapse under its own greed.

                I have spoken with dozens of Boomercon/Civnat types since the election. At least 90% of them firmly believe that American politics are inherently centrist and self-correcting, and that Republicans can take back the government. They have a rude awakening coming at them.

                    One might hope they awaken, but that assumes some rational basis for their current belief.  I’m guessing their current belief is an emotional coping response—which, to abandon it, is to enter into despair and hopelessness.  Like the Jews to the gas chamber, they hoped that they really were going to take a shower—right up til the gas was seen pouring out.

            I think it’s wishful thinking to believe this is going to end soon; the Soviet Union lasted 80 years, and it could have lasted longer had better leadership arisen. Boomers and Gen-X types want to imagine things will clear up and get back to normal by the time they are ready to enter the grave.They want to die in peace, but it won’t be so. They’ll die in a totalitarian state knowing their people will meet the same fate as the Indians before: broken, ruined, and exterminated. If there is a God, that’s a fitting punishment for the people who destroyed this country back in the 1960s. I wish them long lives and hope they get to live to see the fruits of their schemes.

                then the question is is how long has this really been happening?
It’s been going on for a long time already and yet seems to be reaching a crescendo.  This is the golden age for the tyrants but they have been working at it hard for over 100 years
Maybe we are near the end of it?  Who knows.

That’s like a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking on history that fails to take into account that these institutions cannot act against their nature. Imperial Japan can’t not attack Pearl Harbor, blacks in Zimbabwe can’t not steal and ruin white farms, and our overclass can’t not destroy that which makes the place run. The nature of the beast that rules over us must be taken into account and it’s nature is…not great.

                That is something watch. The market topped out toward the end of the Trump reign. That means two choices are ahead. One is it stays flat while the fundamentals catch up and the happy juice from the Fed drains away. or, it corrects to match reality. This attack on the shorts could easily turn into an attack on the longs.

                        They are taking a run at movie theater chain AMC today.  The hedge funds claim they have covered their shorts, but we will see how they fare long term.  At a minimum there have been a lot of angry phone calls from high net worth clients who blindly let these people manage their wealth.

Not “could”. This is absolutely inevitable, at least in the specific case of the Gamestop stock. It will crash just as spectacularly as it grew.

                    Asset returns over the next decade are something to watch. Return expectations are historically low. A reasonable estimate for a 60/40 portfolio using the S&amp;P and treasury/corporate bonds is ~1% to 2% annual above inflation, maybe a touch higher but not much.That’s dramatically below its historic average of ~4% to 5%. Pension funds are in a world of hurt. They’re already doing all kinds of things to generate income, including selling options which could turn out very poorly.  Retired Boomers are also in trouble.My point is that we’re staring at a decade of likely low economic growth and poor asset returns. (The Fed can only push up prices so long. At some point, corporate earning matter.) Combine that with the costs of the Boomers and the government will be pinched.

                        I have been assuming we are near the front end of a significant cycle out of stocks from boomers needing to pay for nursing homes. In talking to a couple of people who manage money, a significant number of their boomer clients do not pull back much on their stock investments even after they retire.  Some “keep the pedal to the floor” as one put it.  Something has to give eventually.

                            They’re right. Most retired people don’t dramatically change their portfolios. A lot have a decent amount of money so they’re not worried about running out; therefore, they design their portfolios more for passing along to heirs, so they keep the portfolio at ~50/50.Wealth is pretty concentrated. Most Boomers don’t have much money. Probably 10% to 20% have the vast majority of Boomer wealth. Portfolios that size don’t need to move huge portions to bonds. Also, bonds are paying anything, so people keep money in stocks. (Thanks Fed.)What’s going to give is the low returns. If wealthy Boomers are only getting 1% a year above inflation, but they’re taking out 4% a year plus inflation, they’re going to start draining the portfolio and become net sellers of stock. Also, corporations may cut back on buybacks.Finally, foreigners who kept the market afloat along with share buybacks over the past decade might switch to non-US stocks, which are dramatically cheaper than US stocks.Boomers selling stocks due to low returns plus less share buybacks plus foreigners becoming net sellers could combine for very crappy stock returns, at least for big US stocks.

                    I think the powers-that-be realized the best way to handle inflation now that they are just flagrantly inventing money was to direct all the extra cash into the price of stocks.  The price of SOMETHING has to skyrocket to absorb all that extra money.

        The totalitarians of the 20th century at least had balls and muscles behind it if not real bullets, the 20th century totalitarians were masculine in nature. The gynocracy as Z has spoken of in his past essays seems to be the character of our new totalitarians which would explain their cat nature I suppose. Women and men in skinny jeans tormenting us with soft totalitarianism with a 7th grade girls mentality.

        The chaotic change of rules has to do with the davos reset, one of their main goals is to collapse US in order to build it back better(this is their actual slogan) as part of a world confederation, this is supposed to happen in 2030(the latest), z got it right, current system won’t last more than a decade.

I like the guy on WSB that claimed to be $35 million up on his GME YOLO.
He was smart enough to harvest $3-4 million, after which it sounded like he couldn’t find buyers for his positions.

        I’ve noticed something about cats which applies to the ruling progressive cabal. Cats that are feral or wild and starving don’t seem to want to torture their pray. They quickly kill, hide it (if they can) and guard it, and eat it. But the ‘satiated’ cats do torture and play with their pray. Sometimes, they don’t even bother to deliver thecoup de grâce,and lose interest once the critter stops writhing.This applies to our rulers as well. These are not people whose survival is at stake (despite their cries of being the underdogs, or some other shit). They are secure in their bubble, well satiated with food, disposable stuff and media. They are just playing at being predators. I think I prefer the feral cat treatment over the satiated cat.

        Why endure such weaklings for a decade?  Worse – why think their replacements won’t be sane, professional totalitarians who may endure decades, centuries, millennia?  China has been “totalitarian” for 2000 years.
India same in their own way.

Worst; what makes you think we survive at all?  We’re passive in the face of weaklings.  We may not even deserve survival, they don’t think we do.

            The problem in China isn’t the totalitarianism at this point so much as it is the corruption.  These can be said to be two sides of the same coin, though I would posit the idea that the place would still be just as corrupt, Communist party or no.  It’s not too different in Japan where a thin veneer of democracy masks the fact that organized crime sits at every level of the system.

        From the shadows, only from the shadows.Going Dark (Cont)After TV, social media is the worst mental disease vector in existence. But this scourge is also an insidious surveillance vulnerability. Photos posted on social media incorporate time stamps and GPS coordinates, and texts are data-mined for all manner of personal analysis including pattern matching &amp; forecasting. And all of this data is used for many malicious purposes including behavior manipulation via social credit/demerit scoring, and it’s attendant rewards/punishments. If your credit card gets turned off, this could well be what caused it. Don’t be a patsy, stop using social media today.

        The old totalitarians generally had limited resources and toying with the victim for needless pleasure was a waste of resources.  They didn’t want the problem to linger.  Which is why I never understood the gassing and incineration of the Jews (and supposedly just as many gypsies but no one cares about them).  Assuming the death toll, wouldn’t it just be easier to put a bullet in someone’s head above an open trench?  That’s what other regimes like the Khmer Rouge did.  It all seems too exotic for a regime that was busy fighting a world war.

            It was always a function of speed and secrecy. The initial extermination was too public, too slow, albeit effective in the Baltic States initially. It was deemed easier to round up a more compliant population with the promise of relocation. A train of thousands of “relocatees” could be eliminated within a few hours of arrival at a “camp”. Also, such facilities of extermination were often attached to production facilities where slave labor was used in the war effort. The dead slave labor of course being constantly replaced by new arrivals.

            The Nazis did start with bullets. But the numbers of people being killed were so large that the soldiers were psychologically breaking under the strain of shooting them all. Turns out that even the most hardened killers do have limits as to how many people they can PERSONALLY kill with their own trigger fingers. Flipping a switch to gas hundreds at a time was easier.

        Everything that’s being done to white people is being done with the cooperation and collusion of white people. We’re still a majority. The “woke” whites who are driving this seem to possess a majority within that majority, for now. Some people say it’s a very slim majority, others say it’s not a majority at all, it only seems like one.All I know is that in any group of friends, acquaintances, or strangers, some shitlib, usually a woman, will cock off loudly and confidently about their latest cause du jour, and no one will argue with her, especially lately.More and more white people are quietly getting fed up, however. Older white people who just want everyone to get along, so they can hang on to what they have, are dying – more of them every day. At the same time, more and more white people are feeling the effects of this “woke” bullshit, and seeing what it’s doing to their children.A day will come – maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will come – when the “woke” bitch in the group starts up, and a man will look past the bitch at her cuck husband and say “Shut her fucking mouth, or I will,” and her jaw will drop, and they’ll both look around the group for support and see nothing but angry glares.When that day comes, it won’t matter if whites have become a minority in our own country. The only credible threat to whites is other whites, and once it becomes clear to everyone that the “woke” are afraid of the rest of us, we will take back everything that has been taken from us.Any browns who try to stop us won’t know what hit them, and the ones who are left will be relieved that we’re on top again.

                I’m fond of pointing out that our greatest enemy – indeed, the only enemy that has ever been a serious threat – has been other whites, since at least 1860 (Zman would say since 1642).(((They))) didn’t create this division, they just exploited it cleverly.

                    would be wise for someone to exploit the internal divisions and hatreds between the seculars and the hasidics / orthodox.  But who among white people would be such a type?  You would have to find a  real true JJJ hater with a brilliant and devious mind. No one comes to mind.One of my corporate jobs was with a company founded by a JJJ.  At our office, the VP and office manger and manger of another division were secular members of the tribe.  Two things always struck me: the vitriol and burning hatred they expressed toward 1) evangelicals and 2) orthodox JJJs.  I suspect with the latter it was more of a family squabbling, but it was always pretty nasty even so.

            Look, the only thing you really accomplish when arguing with woketards is proving that you’re stupid, too. Interpreting someone else’s expression of opinion as a personal affront is juvenile and feminine. Arguing with the unteachable in a poor use of time. As a famous carpenter once said, don’t cast pearls before swine. Pigs are going to put things. Don’t take it personally and don’t worry about correcting it. Let it go.

        Dogs and Cats is one analogy. Werewolves (essentially fierce but mindless brutes) and demons (shrewd and sadistic monsters) is another. At any rate, this ominous piece concludes on a surprisingly hopeful note. Let us hope that, indeed, this totalitarian instantiation vanishes swiftly. But I don’t think it will unless there is mass rebellion against it. The “people” have to get the bit in their mouth. Right now, alas, they show little inclination to do so.

        Along those lines a lot of the Biden executive orders are just replays of the Obama orders (or sometimes new variations thereof).  Forgotten, even though it was only a few years ago, was the damage Obama’s fitful fancies did to the nation and economy, like he would wake up one day and decide that businesses had a moral obligation to hire only people with a extra toe, or something.  It got to the point that no one would ever hire anyone ever since it wasn’t worth the risk.

The politicians themselves are reprising their Obama roles. I just found out that John Kerry is back, telling oil workers that the government that just killed their entire industry will give them better-paying, Green jobs in their home communities.
As meth dealers, I assume.

            I’ve been around many dogs, and the big ones inhale food was fast as their throat can pass it to the stomach (unless it has bones, which necessitates some gnawing and chewing). And the small yappy dogs tend to attack it with smaller bites and a snarl; that is unless they’ve been spoiled by their owner with “gourmet” dog food and develop a snotty attitude about what they will eat.

            Imagine say you’re Italy and you only let in Americans with vax docs.  Only maskers allowed.  You are limiting your country’s tourism to the most neurotic fukked up people there are lol
I can just see the poor people of Italy having to deal with them, but they need the money so they have no choice.  But behind the scenes the mockery and jokes will be off the charts.  Good times.

        There’s a lot of people making all sorts of analogies here using cats as an example – who don’t seem to know a damn thing about cats.Riddle me this:  If two people were walking their pets down the street – and one had a 100 pound dog on a leash , and the other one had a 100 pound cat – which one would lead to almost immediate pants-shitting among a good portion of the population?I have had a probably a couple of dozen cats over my lifetime – and among those, were a couple that were just stone cold killers.  Both of them had been “feral” before they decided to take up residence under my roof – and the difference between their behavior and the cats I’ve had that lived their lives completely around humans – couldn’t be more stark.The “domesticated” cats – do indeed play with their prey.  But it’s like they have a latent killer streak – they don’t know what to do with.  The feral raised cats – don’t play with anything.The best example of that I ever saw was one “domestic” cat – that had a caught a chipmunk,  he was indeed playing with it.  I got the cat away from the chipmunk – when out of left field came the ex-feral on the run and he scooped that chipmunk up in his mouth without even breaking stride  and killed the thing while he was running with it.The “man” doesn’t let people own anything but “domesticated” cats – for what is probably a pretty good reason.They tend to kill shit with great efficiency.15 pound dogs tend to be whiny paranoid little bitches that live in a purse.

        I’ve observed both cats and dogs kill and eat what they’ve killed.
Cats like to play with their prey before they kill it, usually partially severing the spinal cord, rendering it helpless.
A cat I used to own would jump in bed with me and gift me a half-dead mouse to share her ecstatic experience (no contact high on my part).
Most interesting is how they will lie in wait in a timeless state waiting for the right moment.

            if “humans” means white people, then probably yeahWe have to always be wary of thinking the world behaves and will respond as we doCase in point, prison.  It was designed by white people for white people on the premise that men don’t like being told what to do and being in cages, so it worked as a disincentive to crime.  But doesn’t work on blacks, who actually prefer the simplicity of the lifestyle and not having to work and manage a home.Larger point being is that everything we have read on totalitarian societies has involved white people doing things to other white people.  Asians don’t mind wearing masks 24/7.  Mexicans don’t seem to mind it.  Etc etcUncharted waters

                    whatever the case, I would not look to any non-white country for clues on what we should expect and/or solutions
And I know that the Asians here in America are big into mask wearing and a number of the women have proven natural Karens.   And there are lots of them here.  I don’t think we can expect any of them as spiritual allies or sympathizers in the fight against tyranny.  Or Mexicans or Indians.    Although blacks like to disrupt life for whitey, I don’t see them leaving the plantation and joining our side.

        Would add to the analogy, that the dog is dumber than the cat, but also more faithful to its (human) God, and therefore it has risen up above other canids and domestics in general. The cat is smarter but less faithful, and while he has risen above many other felines and domestics too, he dies more often on the streets as a wanderlust.Also, the fascist states would have settled into order even more (they already had), had they not been constantly attacked by the alliance of democratics and commies that owns the world since 1945.Also, Torquemada was race realist iirc.

                Honestly, cats are just retards with incredible reflexes. They get fascinated by the dumbest things and are constantly doing stupid things for apparent reason. However, they are extremely good at clawing their escape from threats. I don’t really get their appeal.

        Excellent piece. I would also recommend on this subject the great Ann Barnhardt. She has a whole series on “diabolical narcissism” that I recommend highly if you want to understand Soros, Gates, Obama, and other government tyrants down to the most mundane mid-level bureaucrat. Though she doesn’t use your excellent cat analogy, she describes how watching us squirm is the biggest part of the sadists’ thrill.

        What if the cat is a pussy, and willingly declawed?  It then…summons dogs.
Dogs who doubted coming but kept faith with the other dogs in danger?  I can attest personally to this evil choice.  I am not proud, shamed a bit actually, but in that evil choice chose my friends in need.  If you know a better way show me.  (Show, not talk).

That trick played will not work again, and already frays apart…

        OT.  It’s disappointing to see, at latest report, that 45 Republican senators helped their friends on the Left by saying they were solid no votes on a second “impeachment.” A second “trial” could make DC look even more insane to any sane observers outside of the Imperial desmene, but trust the GOP to prevent their progressive buddies from making serious mistakes.

        I can’t stand either and once threw a former roommates cat into the dryer to teach it a lesson. It came out alive but was taught a painful lesson of repentance in the process. Perhaps we should do the same with those who try to rule against us?

            Well there is one thing that cats WILL do – and that is take vengeance.I’ve never really seen it myself – but I’ve known multiple people who have had cats that basically did a “phuck you” – on their owners.  Sometimes it was something as simple as knocking over a picture on the mantle of somebody who just yelled at them.But the most epic one was the guy I met at a friend’s bachelor party – who hated cats.  His wife had two – and he admitted to constantly torturing them , kicking them – things like that.  Well one morning he starts coming out of sleep – and he is having a dream that he’s drowning.  He wakes up …………….  to find the cat taking a piss …………….. in his mouth.Read a story on Quora a few weeks back about a tiger in India that turned up in a town in India – hunting down specific people , who had been out in the bush trying to track him down.

                I don’t doubt your story, but my opinion of cats remains unchanged.
