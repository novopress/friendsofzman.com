        “Another reason the political class of Europe is carrying on as if Genghis Khan is about to cross the Dnieper is they think it builds popular support for rebuilding their militaries.”Everything said about the lack of asabiyyah in yesterday’s op-ed applies tenfold to Europe. The political class of Europe can try to gin up popular support for the military all they want, they aren’t going to find anyone to find in it. The average Frenchman or Brit or German is not going to go sign up to fight and die for Ursula von der Leyen and Mark Rutte. They’re not going to go and die so a bunch of Africans can “comfort” their women afterwards. The idea is ludicrous. It’s not happening. Europe is over.

            Politicians don’t need to convince drones to fight. Popular support matters not anymore.
If we are to have a nasty war with Russia, then it will be drones doing the majority of destroying while the people run for their lives while listening to their “leaders” trying to sound like Churchill.

                The drones make for flashy headlines but you still need boots on the ground to fight. Hence why Russia is still gobbling up territory in Ukraine while the media is creaming their pants over Ukraine’s latest drone terrorist attack.

                    Like previous stunts, the drone attack is more of a publicity stunt than a military operation. For a few years now, the sole focus of Ukraine military operations has been subordinated to the political need to involve the United States directly in the war. It is not irrational. It is the reality of their situation.This is why the Russians ignore these things for now. They know that as long as they do not take the bait, Washington cannot declare war on them. As long as the US is not directly involved in the ear, the Russians will win and avoid a nuclear apocalypse.

                        The only way that the Russians can lose the war is for the US to get directly involved. The only way the US would get directly involved is if Russia attacked NATO territory or ships.
It must be incredibly frustrating for the Russians, but, ultimately, they just need to ignore what amounts to taunts to win the most important war in Europe since WWII.

                            The US will not get involved. If they do they will encounter a peer enemy. The Russians will inflict the same casualties on us as they did to the Ukes. It doesn’t matter to them who drives the tanks or Bradley fighting vehicles…they will scrap them regardless.Americans don’t have the stomach for that.

                                If we had had hard time with the Afghans, and we avoid war with the Persians, then I would assume the Russians are a cut above. The USA is built to bully armed insurgents, not engage great powers.

                                Washington would also be going to war with a hostile public at home that opposes direct war with Russia.  Hence the proxy war and multiple attempts to get the American people to support escalation.  To this, the public as repeated said 80%+ majorities, “eff off”.

                    Correct. I’m crrtain the monsters want to develop AI soldiers but that seems out of reach. They face the prospect of massive uprising with a draft and technology has limits. FUBAR.

                        These people truly are monsters who salivate over their vision of a monstrous world. In that world, their toys are made by robots, the code for their phones and porn sites is written by robots (or Pajeets in the interim), and their food is grown by robot field hands (or migrant labor in the interim). As for what the vast majority of the people will DO – they don’t care. If they werenotmonsters, they would be thinking about some sort of UBI scheme to keep everyone from starving but you don’t hear about that anymore. The phony “Left” used to talk about it but has now completely shifted focus to “mor wogs” and “mor buttsecks”.They won’t actually get their twisted utopia. Instead people will start forming terrorist cells that exist solely to send drone swarms to bomb their villas, shoot down their private jets, and sink their megayachts. The Ukies and Ruskies have shown the way.

                            You got it. When there is no way for men to rise, but they can obtain the same near peer technology, they will be under constant assault. If they go to Mars, well, that would be like the monarchies of Spain, Portugal, Holland and England moving to China during those centuries of expedition. The logistics of the European global sea navigations were massive. The logistics to support the most basic Mars outpost will be way more massive.In addition to their villas being under seige so will their runways be. Finally, the robot utopia works unless the population of the earth revolts and just dismantles and sabotages the robots, which the people will do.When you forsake people that badly by abandoning all morality, then all bets are off. They have already abandoned all morality by invading us, subjecting us to a clearly planned social engineering experiment of mass miscegenation and forced integration. I think they have no idea how many capable enemies they have made.Once enough people realize that they don’t have to honor the old rules long abandoned by the ruling plutocracy, and they will, Larry Ellison better get his robocop bots and a fresh set of plastic surgery and de-wrinkled fish lips so he can look good for the wrath he and his buddies are summoning.This is BS and it has already gone way to far. Having that irradiated ant larvae pillow biter in Tel Aviv mock us and call us useless should have been the final provocation. Soon enough

                    This is absolutely correct. The Russians, once the initial phase was over and they realized that a negotiated settlement was not forthcoming, revamped their doctrine and force structure. One summary is that they went from heavy brigade-centric to more mixed-divisional elements. The primary thing they added that their after-action analysis decided was lacking was INFANTRY.

                        Also important to note that once the initial peace talks were scuttled the Russians realized they were in for the long haul and went back to their attrition warfare that they’ve excelled at for a long time. I grow weary of trying to explain this to joe normie who has been convinced that Russia is getting their ass kicked and can’t even beat a “small” country like Ukraine. Their reasoning is always the same: Russia didn’t carpet bomb the entire country and win in 96 hours so they must be losing.

                    Hilariously, a lot of it is in China, you know, the ally of the country they’re trying to start a war with. I’ll be loads of fun watching the drones turn around and kill their operators.

                How can the banksters start a war if there is no one to fight it? What I am saying is that the banksters are ruling over a pile of rubble. There is no civilization left to take advantage of and draw from. They’ve bled it dry. They already smashed European civilization in 1919 and then finished it off in 1945 and the idea that they are coming back for more is ludicrous. There is nothing left.

                        How’s that working out for them? Also – the Ukrainians actually did possess a nationalist conscience and had an army that fought hard when the Russians invaded. That army got totally destroyed. Then Ukraine raised another army, trained by NATO, that it sent out to try to reclaim what the Russians took. It got destroyed. This “pull a kid off the sidewalk and throw him in a van” stuff is a sign of the end and what it definitely is NOT a sign of is a functional fighting force. By all accounts Britain and Germany and France and Finland and Sweden will have to do this at the start. You can’t fight a war like this.Like, on some level I get it, we are ruled over by people who are both evil and hate us, a very bad combination, but they have to live in reality too.

                                As was noted, the Ukrainians had some national spirit. The last time they did any polling no German was willing to fight for their country, let alone some border skirmish.

                            I believe the Ukrainians would have given the Russians a hard time if they crossed the Dnieper River from the outset and tried to subjugate the country–whether or not they tried some sort of Schlieffen Plan and attacked south through Belarus. It should be obvious that Russia’s desire was to rescue the ethnic Russians in the Donbass oblasts. Now, having taken serious losses in fools-errand counterattacks, the AFU might not be able to defend the rest of the country, let alone take back regions with a hostile, territory-savvy armed citizenry backing the Russian military. I’ve riled up more than a few folks who continue to Stand With Ukraine ™, but I bear no malice toward either of the combatants; rather, I’m enraged at the neocons with their ancient, atavistic  animosities that have become “enshrined” in what passes for foreign policy. I don’t know what Trump is up to (which might include Trump), but we can only hope that the BlackRock War comes to an end ASAP–likely to the satisfaction of the Russians and the resignation of the Ukrainians–Brest-Litovsk 2.0.

            I mentioned it previously, but after Starmer suggested a draft, young actual Englishmen put out vids and otherwise publicly stated they would go to prison first.

                        Of course, if you’re in prison your wife and daughter may be raped. And perhaps you, too. It’s an awful predicament. However, if you don’t have any womenfolk to worry about, prison is definitely your best bet.

                Imagine if Britain or France lose a war today. I would imagine that they would get flooded with foreigners, dispossessed of their birthrights, pushed out of their historical lands, and become second-class citizens in their own nations. In other words, nothing would change. People will sign up to fight and die for a society they feel is worth fighting for, and Europe ceased to be that long ago. The US is getting there as well.

                    The United States is there. Without evidence, I suspect the recruitment numbers also are falsified.

                        The claim that recruitment instantly jumped after last election day seemed like “priming” (or whatever salesmen/scammers call it). There is apretenseof “putting the woke away,” to calm the angry white man and give credibility to commentators who claimed it would happen—all recent converts to the right (i.e., not rightists). The real thing isn’t happening at all.I’m sure there was a little bump. Some people are really stupid. We all saw some boomer-con types saying online that their sons were relieved to be entering a military that was back in the business of fighting for America. They were gonna sign up anyway, to kill for child buttsex. “Warriors” don’t care. Theyserve, no matter how gay that is.Reminder, since these days the news goes by without our seeing it: Trump didn’t know about Ukraine’s latest stunt, or about their recent attempt to assassinate Putin, until after the events. So these were American attacks, to demonstrate Trump’s exclusion from the chain of command. As such, effective but unnecessary. Like Putin doesn’t know. As actual acts of war, taken at face value, they’re womanly provocations.Hit me back so I can call the cops.Embarrassing.

                            When I see the YT channel promotions of military exercises or the move to the border, it still has the now standard might negro front and center and a lot of fat and dumpy sows who look entirely useless getting a lot of the screen time as well.
I am sure they are bumping White men as you can’t change it overnight, but a bad sign is that the camera work and editing is still emphasizing a post-White post-American military.

                        From my albeit limited vantage point, the USO at O’ Hare, we seem to be receiving more recruits. They tromp into one of the USOs and register with us for future USO benefits prior to proceeding to a corner of baggage claim to complete their recruitment process, before they “catch” (ha-ha) the bus to Great Lakes. Also, there seem to be more white males than in previous years, when the USN was looking more like a maritime Foreign Legion or coed Merchant Marine than our nation’s blue water force. The young ladies seem to make up a smaller proportion than in the past, but they too seem not to be uncertain of what they signed up for. In the short term at least, the Trump Effect has made parents appear less inclined to discourage or forbid their sons to enlist. We shall see.

                            This, combined with some of the comments above about how hardly any young native Europeans would fight for their “countries”, suggests an interesting question. Is there just something inevitable about the fall ofallof Europe at this point?Here’s what I’m getting at. Several things are happening at once. America is backing away from it’s defense of the continent, the Russians and Chinese have built an enormous industrial and military machine, and the European elite have deliberately flooded the continent with millions of useless and violent wogs.Nature abhors a vacuum. Eventually, someone, Russia, China, or the wog Jihaddis dreaming of a new Caliphate, will simply roll into London, Paris, or Berlin and announce “that’s it Eurofags, this place is ours now!”. They will then produce an automatic rifle, let off a burst of fire at the sky, and yell “who wants to dispute this?”. No one will take them up on it. In fact, a lot of people will probably breathe a sigh of relief – finally, we can stop taking orders from women and queers!I would also be watching for well organized religious cults, or “security” companies, tired of being paid tens of millions by effete Eurocrats who control billions, billions that could just as easily be enjoyed by the security company’s executives and spread around to its hired goons. At some point Europe will become so obviously worthless that it will be unable to defend itself from just about anyone with half a brain, a bit of courage, and a gun.

                        Sweden just announced forced integration. I believe the state sponsored educational TV and school propaganda now has Muslims as indigenous Swedes.
Similarly, King Charles just supported Carney continuing mass replacement migration. The elites are going to do this. They are all in. The solutions cannot be posted.

                    That’s another scenario like the others I pointed out in my other post. A group of disaffected young men in the military deciding they would rather use their guns to shoot the people who destroyed their nations instead of Russians, Iranians, or whoever the Eurotrash elites try to get them to kill. Police or MPs sent in to arrest them might actually join the fun, followed soon by many angry citizens. I believe they call this a revolution!

                Nah. Forced conscription only worked with white people who already had a sense of nationalism and a sense of duty, and even then it only worked some of the time — cf. the Irish riots of 1863 and the hippie riots of 1968.
It will never work with Muslims and other nonwhites and in the post-Sixties West whites won’t go along with it either.

                    Exactly. I suspected Trump was allowed to win because of the need for cannon fodder. That isn’t going to do it, and a false flag wouldn’t, either. Draft riots today would present even bigger challenges due to exposed infrastructure, weapons know-how, etc. They made their bed and will sleep in m it one way or another.

                “If they decide to make war, all of the young men will be forcibly conscripted”Forcibly conscripted by whom? Who is going to exert the force? If memory serves, even Roosevelt had to introduce conscription cautiously and gradually in WW2. And young men who didn’t want to go to war formed the backbone of the anti-war movement in the late 1960s. Cars and buildings on fire, clashes with the police, and the urban situation spiraling out of control. When Nixon stopped the draft, the anti-war movement collapsed. Starmer, Merz, and Macron have sh!t for brains but even these morons know conscription won’t wash.

            Europe is indeed finished, at any rate the western half of it. It was a great run, but now it’s as gone as gone can be. I am just glad that I got to hang out in London in the early eighties when it was still an English city, and attend Mass at Notre Dame de Paris before the fire.For that matter, eating lunch in the Capitol, ca 1985. Oh yeah, ordinary people could do that. I met Ted Kennedy, eating lunch in the cafeteria where my wife and I decided to eat. I walked up to him, and said, “Senator Kennedy, I presume”? He shook my hand, I told him it was a pleasure to meet him, and that was that. In my mundane life, that stands out as a highlight. Of course I detested the man as a politician, but still…That was the republic I grew up in and believed in. All gone now, of course.

        “They say all wars are banker’s wars and this has been true since the spread of popular government in the 18th century. “This is correct. It appears that many in both World Wars were aware they were fighting on behalf of arms dealers. However, the underlying population had patriotism on steroids, large/reasonably healthy families, and an appetite for war then. Now we’re dealing with “citizens of the world” from tiny families who get PTSD from a week of rain. That’s why banging war drums are even more absurd. Nobody is going to die to defend a a government and place that’s handing over home to millions of strangers. Call up a draft. It doesn’t matter, because the masses don’t want it. Even being in prison means they don’t get shot at.

For most of my adult life, I’ve been reading about hawks and MIC midwits and warmongers and neocons littering the various administrations. Both Democrat and Republican and self fart-sniffing NYT columnists.Yet nothing has happened, even when far more cranks and bloodthirsty types were in positions of power. I wonder if we had our chance, and now it’s impossible to fight, and we’re just hearing the last impotent sputtering as Western societies decline further.Let’s suppose Russia declares war. What does the MSM, the blob, and all those Tesla-burning libtards do about the Trump administration? Do they hold their nose and support our troops and our Commander in Chief and wave flags? Will they tolerate more bombastic speeches from Trump about how we’re stopping the Russians? Will they tolerate Trump winning a war?I think the hatred of Trump is stronger than the need to fight Russia. Plus, for the first time in a long time, we have a rather anti-war administration, and a whole lot more questioning and skepticism coming from the Republican side than would normally be.We’ll just be pussyfooting for a few more years like we have been doing. That’s all we can do: pussyfoot.

            America appeared to be very isolationist and sensible around 1939-40. Then things changed. I don’t know if they can pull off a switcheroo like that nowadays. Maybe, maybe not. Of course that relates only to popular sentiment, not to warfighting capability/industry.

            This gets into the op-ed from yesterday. By the mid-2000s it became obvious to me that if there was another major terrorist attack on US soil, the response would not be what it was in 2001. Things would devolve into partisan bickering and pointing the finger. Now this was largely a result of how Dubya’s gang of crooks mismanaged the PNAC projects post-9/11, but it set the tone and things are far worse now. The Democrats support the CIA and the deep state but isn’t sending soldiers to go fight the wars it has pushed for. The Republican party largely supports the same things that Democrats do, but normie grillers support Trump, not the Republican party. They’re still sending soldiers into the military but also support Trump’s anti-war tack.

            Yes. I Think you are correct.   All of their easy wars are over never to return.   The wars they want to fight are currently impossible for them to fight and win so they screech like a bunch of scorned women.The MIC is designed to steal tax dollars not to fight real wars.   For the MIC to become an actual war fighting machine it would take at least a decade to adjust the culture.   You would also need a huge industrial capacity and competent, intelligent and  loyal workers in large numbers.   We will never have that again.Trump made possibly the most ridiculous statement to date recently:“We have the strongest military we have ever had including the fact that we are stockpiling weapons at a rate never seen before in our country.”What on earth is that man smoking?

                At this point Trump is pretty much a figurehead who knows nothing and controls nothing. You would have to be insane to believe that our intel agencies had nothing to do with the drone attacks and the bridges being blown. He is being mushroomed and may give us a real war at this rate. A real war we can’t win either nuclear or conventional.We aren’t stockpiling weapons; we’re just making the MIC drunker on profits and starving the rest of the country. If we were serious about rearming with effective weapons we would call a timeout for about twenty years and nationalize the MIC and imprison every general, admiral, Congressman and upper management in the actual companies. Were I draft age I’d probably fight for the other side. I’d have no desire to die for what we have now.

                    Yes.  Another thing is the Russians just put forth a very reasonable plan to end the war.   Basically Istanbul plus.   Bottom line is Ukraine remains a country and they also keep Odessa.   Russia keeps Crimea and the four new annexed regions.
If Trump was well informed about anything he should take this deal and run.   The fact that he won’t, IMHO,  tells me the neocons and their oligarch bosses are in charge.

            The Titanic’s maiden journey was going very well until it hit the iceberg. As for Trump’s administration, how on Earth can anyone see them as desiring peace? Trump is funding the genocide in Gaza and continues to arm, fund and share intelligence with Ukraine. Either he or his myrmidons almost certainly knew about the airfield attacks, and he has resorted to calling Putin “crazy”. Not the behaviour of a peacemaker.

            The problem with assuming just because we have reduced capacity and the event has not occurred, that it cannot occur in the future. That’s the issue I see, is that our dipshit leaders think they can just preen and strut and nothing will happen because they think it’s theater, and for the most part it is. But the history of war is replete with misunderstandings. Lindsay Graham is the poster boy for this. He’s out there threatening sanctions and carrying on like he’s a shot caller. Any one remember when he called for the assassination of Putin on Twitter? He needs to get a polonium umbrella to the leg on a dark DC night. “Guys” like Graham are the ones that start wars, not by signalling weakness but by signaling some BS tough guy boast that gets answered in a big way and escalates from there.

        “why [do] Western leaders seem so desperate for war?”LOL who’s going to fight it? Women, queers, blacks and Muslims? Every Western army is shot through with DEI. Whites no longer have birthrates high enough to produce enough cannon fodder, and white boys in the U.S. and the UK have been redpilled by the Iraq and Afghanistan farces. There’s no way any Western country will ever have a successful draft again. Nonwhites would evade it. Nonwhites within the military will mutiny. Women will get pregnant or become disabled.Every Western military is a grift. None of these countries has an army that is going to do bayonet charges against Russians over Donbas or against Chinese over Taiwan.

        The Russia obsession defies all logic, except that of the McGuffin. After the GFC and then the immigration crisis, the EU was totally broken. Onward came Farage, Geert Wilders, Le Pen, Orban, Cinque Strelle and Salvini, Vox, AfD et al. So Russia and Project Ukraine became the McGuffin/fuel that would get the EU show back on the road, providing the excuse for repression of reform movements and centralization of more power. Wrecking Ukraine and risking WWIII means nothing to these theater-kid EU psychos. In this regard, EU motives are different from US (money) motives. But it will all look the same in the end. I doubt Trump can stop this train.

            The European natpops – every single one of the names you listed – are globalist sock puppets. They don’t need a McGuffin because they own the opposition and they will obediently shoot themselves in the foot to avoid the embarrassment of winning an election.

Well put.  Shows our rulers understand mass population control in the various Western nations thoroughly.  We are a Managed People, as our host frequently points out.
Donald doesn’t blow the whistle on women — assuming he is sufficiently bright to know their grift — and that got him over the Woman Candidate hump.
Trump’s cut from the old Romanticist mode, add on his two daughters, and he ain’t bucking the gynocracy, to say the least.

        All true. But the elephant in the room is that the European Central Banks were counting on the looting of Ukraine to provide an illusion of captured collateral to backstop their refinancing of sovereign bonds, i.e. keep their bonds markets from collapsing. That ain’t happening now thanks to Russia, and they can’t keep the illusion viable much longer. And that means a financial collapse in Europe may be coming on sooner than anyone thinks. What will follow is serious civil unrest. And all of that is a harbinger for the US.

Is it possible the immigrants are a pincer movement?Not just the obvious placement of troops, but with the social spending intentionally meant to backrupt European countries, either breaking the will of their heritage population (deNazification), or making them destitute and desperate enough to take soldier’s pay (and rationing, for that matter)- pacification and janissaries.
And, ensuring enough wealth for their satraps, of course, by participating in theonly game in town.

            How most people in this crowd have evolved should shake the powers that be to the core. Back in the early 1980s, I remember sitting in a movie theater cheering when Rocky knocked out Ivan Drago in Rocky IV. They’ve misused the war card so much that I don’t think they can get that feeling out of too many people anymore, not to mention that I’m not going to send my kid to die for the benefit of “diverse America.”

        I wish Russia would just steamroll the Ukraine and just be done with it, but perhaps even they can’t.  Which further reinforces the fact that neither could the “vaunted” US and especially any European country.  As others here have stated, no one is going to be able to raise any kind of serious fighting force, let alone get into whatever theater there is.  No one in dirt people land gives two s**** about Ukraine or Russia and are more likely than not sick of hearing about them as well as the impotent bellicose yammering from their “leaders”.  Unfortunately, if the blackrock crew and their fellow travelers can’t be brought to heel, everything may go up in flames regardless.

            I think Russia can steamroll if they wanted to. What they don’t want is to conquer a bunch of territory and then have to battle a bunch of insurgents afterwards. (Kind of like our situation in Afghanistan.) Russia’s methodical approach is the better way of doing things, even if it is slower.

            I believe that Russia can steamroll if they desired but they have to hold back in case NATO were to commit troops. It is prudent to not exhaust your military winning the easy fight when there is another looming on the horizon. They have long practiced attrition style warfare, only they’ve gotten better and don’t waste their troops, in stead choosing to methodically grind down the Ukrainians. This doesn’t appear to be winning from the West’s gnat-level attention span perspective, or the West does understand it and is just lying, but it is effective. It also delays the fight for them so they are not taking on Ukraine and NATO at once but eliminating the threat of the first and then in a better position to take on the next.

There are legal mechanisms in Western countries to actually do this, but no one actually has the stones to do it.Probably because unlike a flu scare, a war will have real consequences that have the potential to turn the sheep into wolves against their nominal leaders.So it’s all fake.

            Covidiocy had and continues to have real and deadly consequences via the jabs. It was much more than a ‘flu scare’. It was war, to be sure, against us, our elders, our children, our livelihoods –  just not of the military variety. Disgustingly, the vast majority – like sheep – went along with it.

Lacking any self-awareness, the usual suspects just assumed that they could run their usual playbook on China (and the rest of Asia and India). It never dawned on them that Asians are different nor that they are a parasite evolved to a certain host. They’re slowly waking up to that reality and trying to figure out a new game plan.

        “A question that is never asked in official circles, or even much in unofficial ones, is why Western leaders seem so desperate for war? For the last three-plus years, they have been scheming to start a direct war with Russia. The rhetoric has been so crazed it suggests they have a death wish. It is not just Russia. They want war with China and Iran, which would mean a regional war in the Middle East. The one thing the West seems sure about is the need for a big war.”Team Biden was, with the European poodles yapping in support. Though I’ve posted critical comments about Trump here, I will not call him a warmonger. He has to his credit consistently tried to avoid war, both now and in his first term.I think Asimov says somewhere in the Foundation trilogy (maybe more than once) that violence is the last recourse of the incompetent. And that may be what we’re seeing now as the West continues on its downward trajectory. A kind of derangement, where the rationale is perhaps that if we’re going down, we’ll take everyone else with us.Coincidentally, I just read this morning Alastair Crooke’s latestessayon Unz, where he cites the French academic Todd:“This [Trump revolution] is, in my opinion, linked to defeat. Various people have reported to me conversations between members of the Trump team, and what is striking is their awareness of defeat. People like J.D. Vance, the Vice President, and many others, are people who understood that America has lost this war”.Crooke goes on to argue as follows:“Today, with the U.S. in an era of unsustainable structural budget deficits, Trump is laser-focused on America’s financial core: The Treasury bond market (America’s lifeline) and the stock market (America’s wallet). Both are fragile. And any external pressure could trigger a chain reaction.”This strikes me as eminently plausible. Though I don’t think Trump can be successful in this — it would be like putting Humpty-Dumpty together again. Still, he has to try.My French is non-existent so I’ve had to use DeepSeek to translate Todd’s recent essay — delivered as a speech in Moscow — bit by bit. But it has been a rewarding read. I’m still waiting — maybe futilely — for an English translation of Todd’s book,The Defeat of the West.

            I’ve been waiting for that too. I would bet money it’s never translated; Todd is too observant and prescient to let that book over here and be widely read. I wish I could speak and read French.

        We are ahead of the curve, but the truths we are learning are slowly working their way through society: Bankers starting wars, the president having no power, installed governments, a deep state that does what it wants. Things are changing, ever so slowly. People are realizing that the conspiracy theories are rooted in truth.
$60 billion to bail out Larry Fink? The fact that people don’t have a date with the gallows over this is mind boggling.
Wait until they figure out that all this global warming stuff was also primarily to benefit the Larry Finks of the world.

            As we’re (and Trump is) discovering. Sen. Lady Bug taking control of Ukraine policy is stunning to watch. Trump, really Miller, is doing some good work on immigration, though neither can push thru legislation to go after the employers of illegals. The elites still control the levers of power.
The only question is whether the tech elites will start having issues with the Wall Street elites.

                Trump has full legal authority now to go after employers. In fact he is  required by law to do so although the Supreme Court says immigration enforcement is optional. Not doing so is a choice.

I’d like to see the receipts, cool numbers. Sending back a few thousand gangbangers is all fine and well but the important statistics is net immigration, all types included.
Mind you, I haven’t been paying much attention in the last six months, but I find it very hard to believe that the globalists suddenly decided to roll back the ethnocide, rising anti-Semitism or no; Jews love anti-Semitism, it gives them leverage.

                        It works like a charm here in Denmark, especially since you have the international media – mainstream and dissident – talking up how tough Denmark is on immigration, while the influx has risen 140% per annum under the current administration.
What they’ve done is rolling back asylum grants, while dialling up “student”- and “work” visas. From what I”m seeing in Copenhagen, we’ve been getting a lot of subs – continentals and Saharans – and a lot of Chinese these last 18 months.

                            Same here. The border issort ofclosed to wanderers (Hispanic) and more open to fake credentials, a specialty of India and Nigeria.
Starmer is doing it too, stopping (perhaps) the “Syrians” while mail-ordering half of India to come and live tax-free.
Trump going after “foreign students” (for dubious reasons) looks like an attempt to thwart this. Must be Miller’s idea. It’s a dump in the face of the “tech bros.”

                                The thing is, I don’t believe Trump is real either – nor Pim Fortuyn, for that matter.Trump might have been legitimately shot (or he might not) but while it’s probably true that you’re not real if you’re alive and not in jail, the opposite does not follow: sometimes politicians get shot by actual wackos, especially if you’re cast as the heel of the show. If Trump is real, he’d be the  first real natpop in modern history.The problem with the “everything is theater”-stance is that then, discussing politics is futile, and that’s a very hard notion to accept, psychologically, because it leaves you the choice of being a mug or accept that you’re as disempowered as any Czarist serf.

        I don’t think Ukrainian resources were the primary target. Russian resources were. Since Plan A failed, they have been trying to make chicken salad out of chicken shit. Which is why things don’t make any sense, appear chaotic. Because they are.
This latest “Ukrainian” drone attack being declared to be Russia’s “Pearl Harbor” was all the confirmation I needed to know that it’s not as big of a deal as proclaimed. Putler is the reigning world champion of not taking the bait, and evidently they will have to do better still to force his hand.

        Caught a bit of Stephen Miller being hounded by CNN’s Jim Acosta. Acosta thinks Emma Lazarus’ poem is the law of the land.Costa is a Cuban immigrant. ELandE check says his ancestors are from the Canary Islands. So, it is probably a safe bet that he is of the same stock as Alejandro Mayorkas. That probably explains his idea that Emma Lazarus’ poem is the law of the land.In any case, the only solutions are ones we can’t talk about. What a disaster.As far as the gold goes, it was acquired by hijacking the legal system. What was taken by making usury and theft legal can be taken back by other means.

They can sometimes buy influence of people with real power, but they cannot do it themselves and they would be crushed if they tried.  A single SWAT team could take down the whole America based leadership of the company.The state is the source of all power.  They have a monopoly on legal violence. It has the final say in all matters within the state.  While having influence on the men who run the state, the power ultimately rests in the state.  That Blackrock is losing their investment in Ukraine is a fine example of the difference between influence and power.  If Blackrock had power, the US army would be in Ukraine.The funny thing is that America has plenty of natural resources. We just make it near impossible to produce them.  We don’t need Ukrainian resources.

            I must disagree.  In AINO, money = power.  Both the ability to buy it and the influence to wield it.  Who’s going to send in your SWAT team (now with new and improved women and diversity)?  The Generals – and the politicians – are all bought and paid for.

        The entire West is facing the problem of enormous Government debt without adequate collateral…A nice world war would allow a general default under the shield of patriotic necessity…The only problem with this scenario is that it has to be able to claim victory, but Russia, China and Iran are far too well armed and unified for victory to be possible…what to do, what to do….,.

            We’ve got the collateral. What I’m concerned with is the mispricing of it all. Theoretically, we have to issue debt so that we don’t dilute the value of the existing currency. Yet $1 today only has 50% of the buying power of a dollar in 1998 or something like that. (I forget who it was, it may have been Bessent who said that.) And even if we do have the collateral, there is also the issue of wasting our national wealth on frivolous things.

                That 50% figure seems as much a lie as the regularly issued inflation stats. Rent  (just to pick one) is at least triple what it was in 1998. Maybe quadruple.

                    Economists have a special term for the phenomenon where some prices, like real estate and stocks, actually track with inflation (instead of with nominal inflation): “cost disease.”
Of course they exclude stuff like real estate and stocks from the discussion—just as necessities are excluded from “inflation.” It’s aboutservices, the ones the rich use too, like medicine and college andvacation. Something must be done!
You can’t hate nerds enough.

        We should actually listen to the crazy pseudo-religious cult infecting our countries. The one with regular sized hats.I remember listening to prog review “A Canticle for Leibowitz.” When he started talking about the post racial nature of the apocalypse his voice started shaking like he was having a spiritual orgasm. It was incredibly disturbing. There is an immense longing for a nuclear Year Zero among the progs. Prog Eschatology holds that all we need is another big war so that Roosevelt II can emerge and rewrite society. WW2 nostalgia abounds.Don’t doubt that there is a large faction in the empire that thinks they’ll win the nuclear exchange.

        Good article.Yes, all major modern wars are wars for the interests of bankers and multi-nationals.  Think I.G. Farben.  Ford.  Coca-Cola.  O yeah baby money ain’t patriotic.My uncle was a POW for many years in Japan, so this betrayal is very personal.Bankers and corporations dictate to political officers and governments.  The London banks are probably still the locus of power in the West.The major banking houses are interconnected with the transgenerational ‘great houses’ of the planet. . . Rothschild, Rockefeller, Warburg, DuPont, Astor etc.  These in turn are interconnected with various ‘occult’ organizations and belief systems so the whole show stays in-house.Scripture refers to these persons as ‘powers’ of the Earth, along with attendant ‘principalities’, referring to the angelic rulers or counselors of these families and groups.The Book of Revelation condemns these persons and groups at various points but acknowledges that during our hour they rule over the planet.  You are correct, collectively they represent a Death Cult.  The cultures they prefer to spawn likewise are death cults, as in mass abortion and war economies.

        The Rammstein boys are to the left of Lenin, but they hit it out of the park with this broadside against U.S. martial and cultural imperialism called “Amerika.”We’re all living in Amerika.Coca-Cola, Wonderbra.We’re all living in Amerika,Amerika, Amerika.This is not a love song.This is not a love song.I don’t sing my mother tongue.No, this is not a love song.We’re all living in Amerika.Amerika ist wunderbar.We’re all living in Amerika,Amerika, Amerika.We’re all living in Amerika.Coca-Cola, sometimes war.We’re all living in Amerika,Amerika, Amerika.There are too many people from my high school class (I’m a Gen-Xer) who believed the post-9/11 propaganda and went off to war in AFG and Iraq and too many who didn’t come home. I can’t forgive that of our oligarchs and I wonder if many more people feel the same way.A collapse is coming. Whether it’s tomorrow or in ten years doesn’t matter. But what does matter is when the plates stop spinning, things have the potential in the West to get really ugly, really fast.

        My impression is that, although they are not eager to fight, many Europeans have a genuine fear of Russia. This seems to be particularly true in eastern Europe, where they have a memory of the previous occupation by the Soviets. I believe it is this fear and not just bankster maneuvering that drives the current anti-Russia policy of European leaders.  It may well be irrational but fear is emotion rather than reason.

            While this is true superficially at least in part, it is misappropriation of blame. There were two successive revolutions in Russia 1917-1918. The first was a genuine broad-based Russian revolution centered about land reform. The second, which did not overthrow Tsarism but rather its provisional government successor of agrarian socialists, liberal democrats, and constitutionalists, was a Jewish project backed by Jewish bankers most notably from America and Sweden.The upper leadership of Bolshevism were mostly Jews and half-Jews, and the great majority of the non-Jews were good self haters, Russians steeped in virtue signaling their superiority to farmers and small businessman. They saw their own people as animals who needed be be reengineered. This minority may have been Russian genomically, but they were not, by their own choice, Russians memetically/culturally.One lens through which to see the 7 decades of Soviet history is re-Russification. There were ZERO ethnonational/ethnocentric Russians ruling over the Russian people, or the other peoples of the Russian then Soviet empire, at the start of the Soviet Union. Russian high level organizers/leadership cadres were either dead or had fled to Paris, London, NYC, and San Francisco.The Soviet project was a Jewish project that used Russian bodies simply because they couldn’t conquer anyone else. There was a great split in planetary communism at the time because most of their theorists didn’t believe it was possible to implement their project with agrarian Russians without the industrials powers further west. (Their post-WW1 revolutions elsewhere, like in Germany, had failed hard.)The Russians (a smart white people with a multi-centurial cognitive tradition) simply rebuilt a ruling class within the communist system that ruled over them. Eventually, they were able to take control over the government which ruled over them, tried to reform it, failed, then disbanded it. They then instantiated the Russian Federation, which I like to think of as an attempt to recreate the promise of the heady days following their first revolution, which was stolen from them at gunpoint by Blackrock’s predecessors.The bottom-line is that those who have bad memories and revulsion of Soviet occupation are focusing on the wrong political actor. Sure, the gun-carriers/shooters at Katyn who did their best to wipe out the Polish ruling class were Russians, but the people who organized and ordered it were not. Don’t blame the cattle if they stampede over your crops while ignoring the cattlemaster who whipped them into stampeding in the first place.If Europeans actually fear totalitarianism, then they should be focusing inward on those of their own kind bending the knee either directly to Blackrock or to other transnational entities like the EU who are in large part the inheritors of a transnational political culture which has mutual ancestors with the early Soviet Union.The current Russian Federation is noteworthy for REJECTING these peoples and their values. The notion that they are going to invade Europe to impose them upon Europeans is ludicrous.

        fwiw, John Helmer said on a Dialogue Works youtube podcast a few weeks back that the primary geostrategic aim of the U.S. now is to — at all costs — prevent Russia from forming a peaceful relationship with Germany. If that happens then Europe is off the board as an American colony, possibly the one exception being the U.K. But this goal is obscure as official policy. In fact, today no one is going to be arrogant enough to issue something like the PNAC again. They learned that lesson.So there is this schizophrenia driving foreign policy today in D.C. The realists no longer take seriously the idea of “carving up Russia.”. Still, there remains an (((influential faction))) that does secretly hope to dismember Russia.This is not going to happen. They’re essentially hoping for adeus ex machina. The problem is, the adjusted scenario does not work either, which was evident even before this war began but made crystal-clear in the desperate act of blowing up Nordstream. Really, the only outcome is binary. Either Europe remains an American colony or Russia transforms it into an economic vassal. The Russians continue to take it slow, watching the disarray at the highest levels in D.C. and knowing they have all the cards.And then over all this hangs the shadow of nuclear annihilation. Will the West play that card? I guess we’ll find out if they really are that crazy.

        The anti-Russian hatred/paranoia started in the mid-1800’s. I honestly believe the Great Game didn’t begin because of Britains fear of Russia taking India or Iran, but Russia defeating the Ottoman Empire and taking Constantinople and Jerusalem. There was probably much gnashing of teeth from bankers and oligarchs over this.
