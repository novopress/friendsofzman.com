        Off topic but I need advice from Americans:
In France, untill the 60’s, people from the US were physically described as tall, strong, fit.
Since the 80’s, they were described as fatties (with bad tastes in clothes and haircut, but those aspects were also present before).
As you know, the situation is obviously worse now.But what happened in the US economy and US behaviours, between 1965 untill 1985,to create such big biological transformation?

            Help us with context. During the same timeframes, the french people were understood in the U.S. as being sophisticated, well-read and creative with panache.
But today the french people are none of these things. For starters, one quarter of the population is not even french. France is becoming a sub-85 g IQ arab and african land.
The young people are becomimg as fat as Americans. French creative works today are plebian.
Without blaming America, what big transformation has occurred to bring this about?

            The US highly-processed food supply has poisoned the population.FDA “food pyramids” have been corrupted by Big Ag and Advertising to addict children to high Fructose Corn Syrup containing products which has resulted in skyrocketing rates of obesity. The obesity creates chronic inflammatory conditions such as Diabetes, heart disease, cancers, bowel disease.In turn, the Medical Industrial Complex gets more sick people to extort money from in the form of “treatments” and expensive e medications that may have utility and may not.Poor childhood nutrition results in worse educational performance over time. The result is a chronically ill dumber population.

                Young people have also been filled with toxins from vaccinations. The vaccine schedule for children has exploded in the last 35 years, with a consequent increase in developmental and behavioral disorders. Almost 5% of boys are now diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and ADD and learning disorders are off the charts.

                    A new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report shows that the percentage of American children who have been diagnosed with a developmental disability has increased, with now more than 1 in 10 boys having an intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or another developmental delay. Based on data from the National Health Interview Survey compiled between 2019 and 2021 for children ages 3-17, the report found that the rates of ID and ASD did not increase significantly, but parents who have been told that their child had an “other developmental delay” increased considerably. “Other developmental delay” includes a range of issues such as cerebral palsy or struggles forming words. This group’s rate increased from 5.08% of kids in 2019 to 6.06% in 2021. The report also determined that among both sexes, 8.56% have been diagnosed with any developmental disability. Additionally, the report found 1.65% of children had an intellectual disability, while 3.05% had autism (4.66% boys, 1.5% girls). Rates of developmental disabilities remained significantly lower in girls, and Asian children were the least likely to be diagnosed with any developmental disability. Interestingly, this report did not find Black and Hispanic children more likely to be diagnosed with ASD compared to White children, unlike recent reports.

        So much of modern day discourse can actually be boiled down to envy. I’ve seen this play out as a sideline watcher. It is absolutely bonkers how the envious are willing to turn everything to shit out of pure hatred and spite.
Vox Day may be a clown, but the word gamma really did sum up the envious and incompetent. Plato, the fool he was, actually advocated for the philosopher-king, which is no more than a gamma in charge (the Elon Musks of the world).
A story beautifully told in archetypical movies like The Lion King.

        When I was Christmas shopping I saw this screwdriver that has an LED light in the handle that would shine on whatever you were screwing.  I really wish I had this thing a couple months ago when I was shoulder deep in a boiler trying to screw the new thermocouple in and the little fucker screw kept wanting to pop out of the seating if I didn’t hold it in place with the third arm I needed.

            Problem is, it’s likely cheap, injection molded Chinese “steel” that will either break or strip by the 2nd use.  As others on here have pointed out, we need old-school quality materials paired with modern design &amp; engineering.

            attach the screw to the driver with a pinch of sticky sealing putty ( thumb gum is one brand). Nebo makes a 400 lumen pocket sized light with magnets on bottom and back and a clip on the back that you can stick anywhere. More tools are not always the answer.

            “the ice people and others didn’t just survive their environments, they built things to overcome it”
Yes, their only mistake was violating the sanctity of other environments. Civilization for example is the corruption of the Forest/Nature by Ice People, which the Forest inevitably punishing with the clown show that represents the decline of every Civilization in history.
So much will self-correct when Ice People fuck back off to the ice, as they are now slowly doing (see Dutch/Flemish shows like “Het Hoge Noorden”, where supposed natives of the forests of West Europe return to the iciest parts of Norway).

        I was just detaching and cutting old electrical lines yesterday in my old house. My technique is to hope I threw the right breaker then turn my face away as I cut the wire I assume is cold.
On that note, speaking of improvements, you can’t get much more convenient than modern polymer safety glasses especially considering the price some people must have payed before they were a thing.

                While I agree, there’s just something satisfying about the moment a wire nut cinches down on the wires being spliced.  No matter how many times I do it I still think the nut’s going to keep spinning around and never tighten down.  But it always does.  In their day, wire nuts were the kind of practical and ingenious invention being discussed in this thread.

                Wild Geese:  Saw those on a YT video and bought a bunch for a rainy day.  We may never have the funds to build a larger house or even an extension, but when wiring needs to be redone or replaced, I don’t want to wait 6 weeks to see when supplies might get back in stock at the hardware store.  Same with flexible gasket (not wax) toilet rings, and a few other things.  My husband thinks I’m nuts sometimes, but I buy odds and ends as I notice things that I think could come in handy.  Not really a large quantity or expense, but just different things that strike me as a good idea.

                    Not really a large quantity or expense, but just different things that strike me as a good idea.
This is an excellent trait to have. It also gets honed after time.There’s nothing like working on something and then quietly smiling to yourself as you know have the exact bobbet you need to finish the task.Quite satisfying.

        So many battery-pack-powered tools and gizmos . . . a zillion small-scale Teslas. (!)
Worst of modern tech is that almost all of it has become disposable. I can recall when most old tech was often repaired, restored to function: there were radio shops, TV shops, shoemakers, all sorts of repair shops. My last three crappy radio-alarm clocks were irreparable, had to be thrown out despite the simple causes of their malfunctions would, in Olden Days, have been easily remedied.
Ah, well, let’s be thankful for what we have, and for who we are: MERRY CHRISTMAS!

            My wife is generally sensible when it comes to consumer goods but she has a few blind spots. One of those was the Dyson roller ball vacuum cleaners. The moment she got a better paying job she got one. They seem to be a commentary on the way everything is built and designed today. The design is ingenious and it’s relatively easy to take apart and clean. At the same time, the parts are over-complicated and the whole thing is made of that kind of hard plastic that’s actually very breakable. I have to constantly be careful that I’m not misunderstanding the way a part goes together with another one and using too much force. So far I’ve managed to avoid breaking it.I would have preferred something with a less gimmicky design but more robust construction featuring metal and much tougher plastic where they had to use plastic. I suppose this is why reconditioned antique vacuum cleaners are still quite prized. There’s a store up the street from me that sells them. I wish she had gone there.So many modern things are like this. Brilliant engineering but the manufacturing is clearly done in the cheapest factory in China. There’s no understanding of the fact the product has to be well done in all aspects, that it needs to seen as an organic whole and that clever design can’t make up for crappy implementation. This seems to be an affliction of our whole society in fact. It’s like the elite thinks they can cut corners as long as they get to show off how “smart” they are in some narrow sense.Well, Merry Christmas to Z-man and to all of you here! May you all avoid falling off ladders for another year!

                My old Riccar vacuum went out, I think it was the motor or the cord, (which is beyond the scope of my very modest vacuum tool and repair shoppe) and the repair estimate was 100, so I tossed it. Now am sad for having done so. Shoulda ponied up and kept the old bitch.

            The reality is that most older products of all types were much less reliable and much more expensive.  We don’t have TV repair shops anymore because a modern flat screen is unbelievably superior and so inexpensive that in the unlikely event that it fails outside of warranty it’s cheaper to buy a new one.  The garbage cars this country cranked out in the seventies when I was a new driver were such pieces of shit that they were literally a waste of raw materials.  Despite the massive increase in complexity, cars are much safer, much more reliable, crash worthy, and require almost no maintenance for the first 100k miles.  Most cars from the seventies were rattle traps ready for the junkyard by 100k.  These examples apply to nearly every consumer and industrial product you can name.  The repeatable tolerances, material advances, and build quality that is routine in manufacturing today was simply impossible fifty years ago.  I feel nostalgic for the social norms and conventions of yore, but as a retired engineer/pilot and life long DIYer, I’m grateful for the countless creative and brilliant minds to whom we all owe a debt of eternal gratitude.

        I expect that many of you are familiar with this incident from WW1, but if you haven’t heard about it before, it is heartening and instructive.During the wretched trench warfare of WW1, a Christmas truce spontaneously arose between the British and German troops.  They sang carols, shared cigarettes, and played soccer.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truceThis temporary refuge in hell occurred because of their shared Christianity.Merry Christmas to all.Thanks to Z Man for his insightful and prodigious writing and for creating a place where so many intelligent commenters can converse.No more brother wars!

            That incident always makes me think of the Paul McCartney song “Pipes of Peace”.  The video, which was a staple in MTV’s early days, is based off the Christmas truce.  Today, half the troops depicted would be African, and a few Germans would have suspiciously large noses, because of course they would.

        A request to those really smart guys who work out ladder improvements: I need a truly magic ladder.  Some months back, I was on the volunteer job, using my impact driver up there off the floor a ways.  Needed something out of my tool bucket, descended the ladder, then started to move the ladder to a better place to continue work.  Was only reminded that I’d left the driver up there at the top when it fell off and bounced off my melon on the way to the floor.  Really need a magic ladder that, somehow, will prevent this in the future.  Tall order, I know.

        Yet another excellent post— and a great way to wrap up a year of the same—reminding us that despite all the idiocy, lies, and ongoing degeneration of standards that characterizes George Floyd America, so much continues to go right.Z’s mention of of the unknown and unheralded ladder designers of the world, serves as a reminder that the vast majority of the discoveries and accomplishments that together make up the comfortable, civilized life we so often take for granted— in philosophy, government, the arts, science, invention and innovation, technology and manufacturing— have been accomplished by that most maligned of modern characters, the dreaded white male.Chances are good that the guy who conceived and designed that useful magnetic ladder tray was not the clever-black-guy-with-a-smiling-white-wife-and-happy-mixed-race-kids— or the adoring-white-guy-grateful-to-be-married-to-the-capable-and-proud-black-female-doctor— that we see in the TV commercials.He likely wasn’t a Biden voter with a man-bun and a rainbow sticker on his electric car.Chances are good that he was a ‘cis-hetero-normative’ white guy driving a pickup truck to work every day, who knows in his heart of hearts that woke is a joke and diversity is not our strength; and worries that our once-great nation is rapidly going to hell in a handbasket..

            “Chances are good that he was a ‘cis-hetero-normative’ white guy driving a pickup truck to work every day”Probably he’s a guy with a college degree, some relatives who work(ed) in the trades, and a Callaway driver in his golf bag. Maybe he votes Democratic, because he’s a clueless Boomer or Gen Xer with an engineering degree, and it’s even more likely true that his girlfriend or wife is AWFL. She rolls her eyes when she overhears him talking earnestly about the merits of GOP candidates. His friends know that he’s p-whipped, like his father was in his middle 20’s, and if he’s married, he paid far too much for the Jewrock on his wife’s engangement ring. When a subsaharan guy and his wife moved in down the street, our inventor was quick to invite them over for a barbecue featuring the new smoker. When he signed up for a Gab account, he identified as a “Constitutional Conservative”, and massive immigration is probably ok, just so long as it’s legal. Victor Davis Hanson sure knows a lot about the importance of supporting civilization by supporting Israel, thinks the golfer on his way out of the house for some practice at the driving range. Those anti-Semites on college campuses need to be stopped.

        Cordless Tools (including weed-walkers and saws-alls).  LED flashlights.  $600 ARs.  (with high-capacity molded magazines and red-dot optics), Blue-tooth speakers.  These are few of my favorite consolations of modernity.

            I thought that was a new name for a weed eater.  I remember watching a video from Britain a few years ago and they used the word “strimmer” which I assume is a portmanteau of string and trimmer.  Had never heard of it before that.

            Not me. I hate the battery revolution or at least the idea of putting a battery in anything you can think of.    Cordless tools are great, I absolutely despise extension cords, but so are 2 cycle engines.  Weedwackers are the perfect example of the utility of small high power 2-stroke engines.  About the only thing worse than a battery powered weed wacker is a battery powered snow-thrower. I  doubt they will last 5 years or more than 50 cycles before you need a new snowblower’s worth of batteries. By then, there will probably be a new battery standard that is incompatible with the old one.Other than having to replace fuel lines periodically on gas appliances, they’re pretty hassle free, powerful, serviceable and something you only have to buy once.

                While it may last a lifetime, your gas powered snowblower is still a major hastle to wrestle up the top of a professional 8-foot ladder. I still prefer my cordless electric model for ceiling-level snowblowings especially indoors.
Merry Christmas, all, especially to Z and his saber toothed tigers.

        ***—***“Men are different [from animals]. They propound mathematical theorems in beleaguered cities, conduct metaphysical arguments in condemned cells, make jokes on scaffolds, discuss the last new poem while advancing to the walls of Quebec, and comb their hair at Thermopylae. This is not panache; it is our nature.”   -C.S. Lewis***—***This season reminds us that hope never fails and never will.  Our ultimate foe, the author of all confusion and discord, builder of a false globalist Babel and enemy of everything good and decent and once called “normal” has already been defeated. Our own lives and struggles aim at the realization of a victory already decided.If you are not a Christian, encourage yourself instead with the quote above.  Resignation is unmanly.  Come what may, there are things to build, things to fix, things to improve, learn, teach and savor in the midst of it.  Doing so is the stuff of life and the seed of any future revival.  Z-man’s post about tools and ladders captures the idea perfectly.Merry Christmas, all.  I greatly enjoy this comments section.

        I must disagree with Hemid up above. There are decent guitars in the $200 – $400 range from Ibanez, Schecter, Eart, Fender (Squire series) and Harley Benton. CNC machines really helped to improve the quality and consistency of guitars while bringing the cost down. Solid state amps have also improved. I’ve seen many bands play small gigs with a Boss Katana or Line 6 and they sound good. They also only run $250 – $350. So there you go, a decent guitar and amp combo that should last you several years all for under $1000.

            A perspectival difference, I think. When I was a kid mid-priced guitars were, e.g., the Holdsworth signature Ibanez, and the average-priced amp was a Roland JC120. These are “pro gear” made for serious work. It’s absolutely possible to make great music with the contemporary price-range equivalents—the things you mention and many more—but the *quality* equivalents are boutique products now, and their prices are inflation++. The “hollowing of the middle class” has happened to everything.

            It’s already happening.Raytheon has been begging retirees to come back and teach newbies how to build Stinger missiles. No one is even talking about modernizing that system or designing a new replacement system.That story about how Japan is going to start building Patriot missiles for Ukraine? Also because Raytheon could not recruit sufficient talent to Tuscon, even after months of offering signing bonuses of up to $50k.Finally, there is the much ballyhooed TSMC semiconductor plant in Arizona. That is at a standstill because TSMC recruiters found that DIE initiatives have totally failed to produce the GAE-promised army of vibrant Phillip Noyce clones to staff the place. The Taiwanese don’t seem all that interested in relocating to an arid desert.

                I have been trying to find Tool and Die Makers for three years.  The only ones with required skills are the old men.  I can’t find any young people willing to even learn the trade.  When the last of the old guys retire, or a fired for being exacting a-holes, well, I guess we’ll outsource the work to Taiwan and accept the poor  quality and late deliveries.

                I think he said that to justify his own atheism.  Actually the NAS crowd is subject to fashions even more so than prison inmates.  That wasn’t the case in the past in regard to religion (think:  Newton, Maxwell, Millikan, Planck, Compton etc etc)  Gervais sounds like an interesting character, however, and probably would be fun to have a beer with.

I may be demonstrating one of the white man’s greatest vulnerabilities:  gullibility, naiveté, and assuming that other races have values and an inner life similar to whites.  But this vulnerability is probably why we built the high trust societies that everyone else on this earth wants to live in.
Tribalism, although mandatory for our survival, does not come easy to my heart.

        May I offer a suggestion for a home project that is both novel and useful. If you have a portion of the house with lots of large south-facing windows (a window wall is ideal), then you can easily construct a narrow vertical planter with shelved planting beds and incorporate a drip watering system that descends from a top trough. Mine is on a trolley wheel cart for mobility and its very easy to water and tend the plants. Lots of edible options that will provide you with auxiliary food year-round.

        I was setting up to do some outdoor painting where I’d need to utilize my six foot ladder.  It’s made of fiberglass and I can easily carry it around with one hand.  When I prepared to work, I also noticed it had a perfect notch for a quart sized paint can, which is what I had – now I didn’t have to try and balance it on the top step – el perfecto.  I also have a fifteen foot or so extension ladder, made of light weight aluminum, which I can also carry around one handed.  I used to have a wooden one which was at least three times as heavy – many things in the DIY workspace have improved markedly.  A very Merry Christmas to all.

        Boy, speaking of battery-powered tools, the Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread has to be the 1/2″ drive battery-powered impact wrenches. Ho-lee fook, bro. Rusted pinion nut? Hub nut? Crank pulley bolt? Transmission crossmember? Head bolts? Braaap, brap, brap. Effortless. No more compressors, hoses, none of that grief.Speaking of the practical people vs. the political nutjobs, one thing I have never been able to figure out is how and why the smart people allow themselves to be put into the service of the political class — who are at best useless teat-suckers, moral defectives, and liars of inferior intellect, and at worst, outright criminals.I have a bit of an interest in aviation, and I am utterly fascinated by the incredible strides made in aviation technology during World War II. All in the service of a rich cripple in a wheelchair, a demagogic vegan, an obese drunk and a murderous communist thug.The military technology employed in Afghanistan more recently was pretty impressive, too — and it was used by a bisexual mulatto stoner from Kenya to give Afghan girls birth control and to celebrate Pride Month at the Jew-S embassy in Kabul.SMDH, man… none of it makes any sense.All I can say is thank God Mary’s son survived Herod’s murderous purge after she went into labor in a f–ing barn… Hillary would have told her to just have an abortion.Merry Christmas, y’all!

            The Chinese stuff has its uses. If you’re stuck with buying a usually expensive tool for a one-off project or just need it for light duty work, a trip to Harbor Freight can save you some major bucks. It’s made possible projects that would have been prohibitively expensive if I’d had to spring for quality tools. Just make sure you’re wearing your safety glasses before turning the stuff on.

        I have a wired hammer-drill even now because every now and then an application calling for limitless torque comes up.  Otherwise I got a sack of battery drills from an Amish Auction for like $70 so I went through and put a commonly used bit into each drill so I don’ even have to change out bits most of the time.Your post brought that to mind because most of them have a little magnetic tray on them to hold an extra screw or two (or bit).  A different drill has a light that comes on which shines just at the point of the drill work, and a different one has a handy level built in.Oh, and the sack had a little battery powered circular saw in it.  I wish it had a laser, but even without it is the handiest little thing.  It will be a shame if the electric cars eat up all the material needed for portable tools which are actually a benefit to mankind.(Of note are the cheap, portable, one-handed chainsaws sold by fly-by-night Chinese tool manufacturers on Amazon.  No reputable company will sell them as they’re a horrible safety risk, but they’re oh-so-handy.  Get one while you can.).Merry Christmas.And Merry Christmas.to y’all too!

                Hmm, Ryobi had (has?) one too but it costs like twice as much as that Milwaukee and required two hands.  Looks like the Milwaukee just needs two hands to get going?  (As the action shots show both one-hand and two-hand use).
Our contractor used both Ryobi and (mostly) Milwaukee which I liked better, but I got battery-locked into Ryobi since, like I said, I got several of the tools for next-to-nothing.

            I have used many corded and battery operated hammerdrills. My Bosch rotary hammer 24v handles every task , even face brick. People are cutting small lawns with battery operated mowers now. It’s a new age my friends!
Merry Christmas to all here.

        First off Z, I apologize for the crack about you being in a full body cast.(Although, you COULD be using talk to type, so . . . . . .)Secondly, I do have some ladders that have holes in the top rung for placing screwdrivers, drill bits, or other items to be held securely, and bins for placing the screws, light bulbs, and other things you need held ready and steady. 1000 times smarter design than a flip-out shelf like on my older ladder which means everything unstable takes a sickening eight foot drop to the pavement below. 🙄Thirdly, what’s frustrating is the halfwits and lunatics you describe ARE impeding the betterment of things like automobiles. Automobiles by the late 1990s and into the 21st Century HAD improved markedly over the bad old days of the 1960s, 70s, and 1980s in terms of reliability and economy. But it’s never enough for The Smartest People In The Room. (Just ask ’em, they’ll tell you they are) So now you suffer through a car with a 1.2L 3 Cylinder Engine with a turbocharger (No exaggeration, that tiny mill powers the latest Buick small CUV) because some pointy head in a Government Bureau demands all the manufacturers cars average 50 MPG.Right Slick, your Engineering Degree is from what University? Oh, you have a Law degree. Yeah STFU until you can design a car, or at least components of them. Otherwise go invent some imagined right that doesn’t exist.(I won’t rant about electric cars, I might have a conniption fit, and that’s not cool. Although I agree with you on Cybertruck.)We suffer from “smart people” who won’t get out of the way of truly smart people because, well, if they don’t tell you what to do, how can they prove they’re “smart”?And finally, to prove I am not a random crochety commenter, Merry Christmas to you and your family and friends, and congratulations on the new digs. May you live there comfortably for many years with many happy memories. And may your improvements and sweat equity make it a home you enjoy.Just no more thinking you’re twenty-something and stomping around a roof, we need you upright with no broken bones.

            Like banning gas stoves, ruining water heaters and lord knows what they’re doing to the evil that is air conditioning, they want the universe to bend itself to their dreams.  Cars are the preeminent example as the mid-nineties were (at the latest) when “peak auto” could be had in terms of reliability, safety, and fuel efficiency (I’m leaving “looks” off because even by then all cars were looking the same, only so many ways to get air out of the way).  Everything since then has been a trade-off.

                    One steamy summer night our air conditioner went out and a desperate call was made.  I was certain we’d have to spend a miserable night, maybe several. But in an hour a man in a truck came and soon we had cool air. He said, “What I done was put a band-aid on it.” Well, this hero’s band-aid lasted us two years. He had just sat down at the supper table when he got the call, but left promptly because he lived 36 miles away. This repair man was a godsend and I will never forget his kindness and talent! Merry Christmas!

                Off topic, but it occurred to me while watching the annual replaying of 1984 Bob Geldof’s “Do they know it’s Christmas time” music video and I can name almost all the participants, how many can you name? And I know all the lyrics to the Dixie Chicks “Merry Christmas from the family” (Mom got drunk and Dad got drunk…)

        There’s a great dichotomy in our everyday stuff.My friends and I are mostly old musicians, and the tools of everyday use to us are better than they’ve ever been, but the *average quality* of musical equipment is lower than ever. The stuff professionals/artists buy is near perfection, and the sonic possibilities available to serious artists are unprecedented, but the “starter” guitar and amp your nephew gets for Christmas are so crappy that Jimi Hendrix couldn’t coax music out of them, so he’s very likely to be frustrated and quit—and far over the standard 90% of new music, from the radio to the concert hall, is artless and retarded.Materials science is at a peak, but everything at the (normie) store—and our “infrastructure” as a whole—is disintegrating garbage at ever-increasing prices.Etc.These remnants of our greatness make our apocalypse—a political apocalypse that’s *almost* engulfed the technological and biological—more poignant.

            The quality has fallen on most things, especially consumer goods.  They can get technically better with modern tech, but get far worse in build quality or needlessly complex.  Toasters with a big LCD screen, an app and an IOT internet connection.  Or a toaster oven that scans foods and calls home to find the best way to heat it up.  Pretty neat tech, but you just know the thing is spying on you.
