        ‚ÄúIf Volkswagen made cars that exploded at the same rate as Muslims, the president of the company would be in jail and the company in bankruptcy‚Äù  Brilliant.  I‚Äôm going to use this often.  Maybe use it in the way Trump would say: ‚ÄúIf VW made cars that exploded at the same rate as Muslims, we would stop importing them.‚Äù

            I remember the Ford Pinto got some press about the fact it tended to explode. Now if Ford would export Pintos to EMO countries, we might be onto something.

                The Pinto did not explode on its own. The owners, being so depressed at having to drive a Pinto, blew up their own cars.
Although, given the ugly styling of modern cars, the Pinto would be a striking design today.

                    Awww, c‚Äômon! The Pinto was sort of fun to drive! Far fewer Pintos exploded than Corvairs ran off the roads into death spirals.

                        My recollection is they built the Mustang II on the Pinto chassis. That was the Charlie Angels car. Mustang enthusiasts pretend the Mustang II never existed.

                            We WISH the Mustang II never existed.If it hadn‚Äôt, many a current hotrod would have a properly designed front suspension instead of that abortion that adorned the MII (and now hobbles huge numbers of otherwise awesome home built cars).If only the aftermarket had found a way to knock off the original Camaro front suspension instead of the MII.Happily, with older modern era Corvettes getting into the price range where people are willing to buy and dismantle them, the C5 &amp; C6 Corvette suspensions are becoming the new standard because they are literally a bolt-on proposition.  Much easier to build the mounting cradle for them even than the MII, which is why they‚Äôre winning the market share.  Eventually the aftermarket will switch over as well, and THEN the world can truly begin healing from the damage done by the Mustang II.  üòâ

                                Europeans often mock the American car culture because American cars have poor handling. They have (had) a point. Long after the Euros were running rack and pinion American cars had the tired old steering box with the worm gear.

                                        The car culture here evolved from the ground up. Poor guys would fix up their car and hit the open road for some cheap fun. In Europe, car ownership was a rich man‚Äôs game for a long time so the car culture evolved from the top down. In Europe, F1 drivers are king. In America, NASCAR is the top motor sport. Even drag racing gets better crowds and coverage than open wheel racing.
That said, America is a big country with lots of sub-culture. If you‚Äôre into the nimble handling cars, you‚Äôll have plenty of company.

Yes, but you should also note that we take out a big, big chunk of the people that supported this  view as well. Purges don‚Äôt stop at the top and their are far more lamp posts than rulers.

        I have long held the view that the people we elect are incapable (or unprepared) for the job they are doing. They are elected ‚Äî should the process be honest and fair ‚Äî on a string of vague promises which is more a wish list than a reality. These leaders don‚Äôt even have to adhere to these so called pledges. A manifesto is nothing more than hot air, and the people who make it lack any sort of cold reasoning ability.I don‚Äôt want to love my leaders: I want them to actually do something other than hold hands in a pathetic show of ‚Äòsolidarity‚Äô to which the Exploding Ones must find highly amusing. To borrow from Shakespeare, politics and leadership now is a tale told by idiots full of sound and (pretend) fury from our great and good, signifying nothing at all. But as you say, once the parade is over and the platitudes uttered these people can congratulate themselves, retreat home under protection and dine well. They don‚Äôt even have to pick up any pieces, just as they don‚Äôt have to wash their own dinner plates.

            The problem is no longer the people we elect, it is the people who elect them. This was always at the center of the progressive design.  Progressives remain safe from retribution because conservatives cannot even imagine that type of malice exists, only right wing nuts can do that.Tocqueville‚ÄìUniversal suffrage the most detestable element of democratic government, and more so a powerful revolutionary instrument.
