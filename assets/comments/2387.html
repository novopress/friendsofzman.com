        To know whether separate entrances make any sense in terms of the building layout, you’d have to see the construction plans for the entire building.  Apparently the affordable units will occupy one separate chunk of the structure and will face the street.  The market priced units will face a different orientation that comes with a panoramic view. From the POV of the building layout, it may make sense to build a separate lobby entrance for the upscale units on the opposite side of the building from the lobby entrance to the affordable units. The location of any on-site commercial properties or the entrance to the parking garage(s) for residents could also affect the decision of where the lobby entrance(s) should be located.

        It is really, really, disheartening when you find out the truth you just posted, i.e., that you will never, ever, be one of the elite, ruling class, no matter what you do, even should you win the Powerball Lottery for $400 million.
It’s not just the money that makes the difference.
