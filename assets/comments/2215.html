        The Powers That Be cannot shortchange the bondholders, as more bonds will need to be floated going forward. They cannot wipe out the taxpayers, because they need more taxes again later on. But savers, those selfish people that keep it all for themselves, now they must be given a haircut. Yup, that’s it, haircut the savings accounts, those people are not doing anything for the rest of us, by not buying bonds or paying taxes on the principal. The taxpayers and bond holders will be kept whole, you can count on it.

        “100k and thirty years gets you 30k per year. It is good but nothing crazy.”The issue raised was the unsupportable debt associated with LOCAL public pensions, not Federal pensions. In various cases that have made national news, local CA government pensions have been obscenely generous.In any case, 30k + 18k Social Security X 2 retired wage earners per family = 96K a year to live on in retirement, long after the mortgage has been paid off and the kiddies (if any) have left the nest. This  is more than enough for most older couples to live on very comfortably.  Plus, some states exempt pensions and social security benefits from their income tax, which reduces the bite of local taxes.

        Federal pensions are only one percent multiplied by years of service. So 100k and thirty years gets you 30k per year. It is good but nothing crazy.

        Florida is sinking fast under the weight of New Yorkers, et al.  Seven thousand people move here each week and what we used to call “government in the sunshine” is getting cloudy fast.
When newcomers comment on the great life here and the positive and friendly outlook of the natives we thank them and politely ask them to stay away from the polls if they want the status quo to continue.  Florida went for Obama, which was a shocker, so it may be too late for us, but I like your suggestion on the voting thing.  Next constitution.

            Virginia went lunatic the last two elections and it used to be a solidly normal state. New Hampshire went lunatic when all the Massholes moved in. I suspect that researchers in the future will discover that a microbe of some sort caused this mass lunacy in the same way the plague wiped out millions. Natures way to keeping the human population down.

        “life time health benefits are included in the retirement plans”
True, but once the retiree reaches full SS retirement age and goes on Medicare, which applies to the large majority of such people, the local government is off the hook for any major healthcare expense and the cost is passed on to the Federal government.  Where local governments foot the bill is for public employees who take early retirement before they’re old enough to go on Medicare.

        I don’t know what kind (meaning amount) of pensions these city/state employees have. I’ve heard and read that they get ridiculous amounts of money, relative to their salaries while employed.I am on a pension from the chemical company I worked at for over 30 years. The major reason I hung in there and kept showing up for work every day after the first 15, when the job lost some of the luster of discovery in experimentation, was the idea of that pension.It’s not much, relative to what I was making, but I saved, and tried to eliminate as many big debts before my income was whacked as possible. That makes it fairly easy to get by, so far.Now, however, increasing health care costs as we age, and inflation, are racing with death. It will be interesting to see which wins out. Seems like, though, the employees you refer to did not do much planning for their senescence.

            Public pensions are extravagant compared to private pensions. In many cases, life time health benefits are included in the retirement plans.

        One possibility is that crushing debt may spur a breakup of the country.  The National Debt could be left with a rump United States.
