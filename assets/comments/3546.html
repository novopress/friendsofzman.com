        Off topic, in one of your previous posts you said:
“Western fanatics are convinced they are Turing machines, processing the data of reality with flawless logic.”
Then i stumbled upon thisSalon quotedescribingAmerican Renaissance:
“Modern science now undermines all of their basic premises, and there is no reason to tolerate their hateful, dangerous, ancient, and outdated assertions.”
That’s in a nutshell how liberals think about us and ties exactly into your Turing quote.
The left, just good solid science!
