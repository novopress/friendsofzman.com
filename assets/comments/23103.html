        No one wants to pull the clown car out of the ditch.  I think everyone, left and right, is ready to say goodbye to America.  On the Left, it’s all just stolen land and plantation slavery.  On the right, it’s a welfare state of freeloaders who have zero value in productive work.We would all benefit from rending it asunder and letting smaller nations emerge from the rubble. Everyone on Earth, from China to New York, from London to LA, is ready to watch America collapse like the Soviet Union did.  I hope for this outcome to come sooner.  I absolutely loathe the leftist media and the Democrats.  I despise the backstabbers of the Republican party.  We have been betrayed and mortally wounded by our political class, which is choosing to dismantle the United States for the sake of wokeness and to appease their Chinese overlords.

        Zman, I have a different take. The intellectual bankruptcy of the Right and Craziness of the Left stem from the same source: the Managerial Elite being squeezed. Charles Murray is good for something, and he noted that the elites all live in the same 11 zip codes, all went to the same 4 schools, and are all married or related to each other, and they all don’t own the means of power and wealth but manage it.This made sense when we needed an ever expanding army of managers from 1920-1970 during massive industrialization and the need to manage the massive marshaling of men, equipment, money, etc. in both government and major manufacturers. But first Japanese imports and then de-industrialization, more and more manufacturing (and managing jobs with it) going to Mexico then China meant managers had to scramble. Hence ever greater wokeness as non-Whites claim greater shares of ever shrinking pies. That’s the source of crazy left — a battle weaponize morality to keep their managerial jobs. Also the source of purges. People are not purged when there are more jobs open than available manpower.The bankrupt Right is funded by the managerial class. So goes along with it. When the managerial class was secure in its internal position and only faced external Communism 1.0, the Right was more intellectually honest as it was funded by factions of managers who did not want to be replaced by Commisars but otherwise had no fears. Now their funding comes from managers fearing their managing job going to Sanjay, Chen, Shaniqua, or Tyrone. Of course they will be dishonest.

            But that doesn’t explain why the craziness has seeped into the intelligence and military departments. This stuff is toxic. And without a steady hand on the tiller, this ship is going down.

        The only thing useful that can be gleaned from current events is an educated estimate of when the collapse will get rolling in earnest. Normie still wants to keep his head in the sand and pretend everything will be alright come 2022 when the Rs retake the House &amp; Senate. Comfort First Baby!!! In reality, nothing will change until the environment changes and real hardship returns. Most will react by whining harder, but at some point, the root problem must be tackled. That is how dissidents can make a difference. That is the road to redemption &amp; salvation.

        Amused to read Douthat thinks Trump might really, when you think about it, kinda be like the Mule, that character in the Asimov novels. Dude is the conservative opinion guy at the NYT and comes up with takes that were insightful here five years ago when Z first served it up.

        By cutting off the paleocons like Sobran and Sam Francis the conservative movement cutoff any chance to survive.It’s too late for them now we are entering the demographic age.The dissident right will continue to grow.Maybe not a linear growth but we will grow going forward.Because we have the truth about man.

            First they cut off people like Francis, now they’ve cut off any base. Not only has the intellectual power of the right evaporated, so has an electoral base ready to follow. The Republican voter block may not be dissident right, but they are in the main contemptuous of their leadership. Trump still has some authority with his voters, but that he would do anything with it is questionable.

        Z is right, all of them in DC at least are finished.  They know it, but until they are pushed off the branches they’ve sawn in half or it collapses we have to endure this spectacle.  They are moving on inertia as there’s no alternative.  Now they may well consolidate their power in the absence of any challenge, and none it seems are forthcoming.  Were something organized in the past it would presently be pushing the gerontocracy off its precipice – but no, nothing but words, no organizing as that meant risk.  One could say it was fear of Feds, but that is a self soothing lie.  It was just fear, plain and simple.Who dares wins, the Dems dared and they won.

        eh I feel the conservative movement was always bankrupt and part of finklethink. Who I find more interesting are movement conservatives who went off the reservation. Think Revilo Oliver or Willis Carto.

        Before I retired from the professing biz (aka “when I stopped giving a crap what the administration thought”), I’d regularly ask classes of undergraduates to estimate the percentage of “African Americans” in the population. Estimates varied, but usually the answer was “25-35%”. I asked “what percentage of Americans are gay?” and got a similar answer.
“So look around,” I’d say. “According to you guys, every third kid in here is a gay Black. Where on earth did you get that idea?”
Blank stares. The propaganda REALLY works, y’all.

        You are overthinking. The whole lefty appetite for political control is about the rewards. Fifty six years ago my wife and I bought our first house. The neighborhood was less than desirable but the schools were the best in the area. One of the houses was “welfare house”. Her caseworker dropped by on Monday and Wednesday to get his ashes hauled. The real estate broker who owned the house was there Tuesday and Thursday. She had Friday off to party with her white trash friends. Fast forward thirty years or so, I was in middle management for a company that was on an old old industrial site. We had a building to demolish, the office had 120 sq ft of linoleum impregnated with asbestos. Mookie from the alphabet agency asked in a very subtle way for some free stuff. The grift is what drive the political control. That and so many people are too stupid to notice.

        Z claims that 50 years ago the Left was intellectually exhausted, but downpage, says this: “Fifty years ago, when the New Left burst onto the scene and set the political world ablaze…”If the Left was intellectually exhausted, how, pray tell, did it set the political world ablaze, and over the opposition an intellectual right that, as Z notes, had tankers full of intellectual candle power? The two assertions are incommensurable.Where Z errs is in claiming the Left was intellectually exhausted. In point of fact, it was invigorated and galvanized by a host of French poststructuralists who had put paid to traditional Marxism, and were pushing a relativistic politics of difference (the clear precursor to today’s multiculti), with which the Right knew not how to deal, and frankly was uninterested in confronting because it did not square with the global communism the Right considered to be the one and only bete noir. The Right concentrated all of its forces on winning the Cold War, and allowed an exuberant postmodern Left to grow unimpeded, like a malignant pancreatic tumor. The victory in the Cold War was Pyrrhic. The nation the Right preserved, died some 30 years later.

            The cold war was one sided. Soviet side did little above basic self defense. There are zero evidence that Soviets ever planned any attack to Europe. All Soviet actions were counter moves to US attacks.

                Here in GB during the latter years of the Cold War the Conservatives always used to say ad nauseam:’vote Labour and the Red Army will be in London by the end of the month’.This made me realise that in order to widen their appeal to the British electorate, who don’t care for extremism, the parties changed the policies to occupy the centre ground. In an attempt to become all things to all men they abandoned their core beliefs. The Conservatives were widely believed to be strong on defence,business and law and order. While Labour were thought to be strong on social issues,i.e. housing and the NHSand industrial relations.Today the three main parties are all much-of-muchness. Bland policies from uninspiring 3rd rate politicians.I have long believed that a country with no strong external enemies will turn on itself.

            “Where Z errs is in claiming the Left was intellectually exhausted. In point of fact, it was invigorated and galvanized by a host of French poststructuralists who had put paid to traditional Marxism,”
This issue has been dealt with here and elsewhere. Z is speaking of the Right in a contextual manner. He has often commented on how the modern right simply follows the left by a few years. He understands as well as anyone there has been zero actual right wing resistance to the left in modern history, especially in regards to equality.

        Looked at a certain way, the only reason the right isn’t bankrupt is because the left keeps printing so much intellectual funny money. Critiquing the insanity of the left is so easy, that one can forget to create a positive argument rooted in real intellectual value. Or as Sr. Dáviila says, “Whoever insists on refuting idiotic arguments ends up doing so with stupid reasons.”

        “When this clown car veers off the road, there is not rescue team ready to pull it out of the ditch.”This is not a bad thing.  One phenomenon I have noticed in a lifetime of playing the “good civnat” is that when the pendulum swings too far to the left and the country “swerves off course”, the Rep’s step in and patch the holes (somewhat), right the ship (as best they can), and steer around the shoals.  In short, saving he Leftists from themselves and putting he electorate to sleep once again.  Indeed, the pendulum swing analogy is a common argument I hear—even today—from the Normies I speak too.So I guess you can put in the “accelerationist” camp.  Best this process complete itself least our children get stuck with the whole shit show while we sleep comfortably  in “dishonorable graves.”

            Full communist tyranny is not veering off the road. Lenin made his revolution with exactly same people like your ones. Snowflakes, sexual deviants ,criminals , mentally defect , and just the spineless filth who were ready to serve their new masters. I cant see any obstacle for full communism in the US.

                    You cannot build an army around snide 70+ year old deserters.  It’s an extremely geezerly crowd of old guys who would have donned the hood and lit a cross on fire in their youths but who are now mere spectators.  The “dissident right” is mostly old white guys.  They are just typing out comments on the internet.  Very little else.

And they are for now but this runaway train will steamroll them too … The question is will they also destroy us first.

        As a fan of classic movies, I was watching ‘Fiddler on the Roof ‘ this weekend and it struck me that Tevye was absolutely correct when he said  –“Because of our traditions, everyone of us knows who he is and what God expects him to do.”The Left has been very successful at removing Christian values, pushing LGBT at every level and now imposing cancel culture. The results are people have become more and more confused about who they are, and no one knows, or cares, what they’re expected to do since there’s no ultimate moral authority to answer to.

                Life is pretty simple. I’m convinced that 80% of people’s personal problems could be solved if they just went to church and read the Bible.But on the left, traditional is evil. And  white Christians are sexist, racist, colonizers. And of course the average “right wing” Boomer doesn’t want to think about his own actions. Ie. He likes chasing meaningless pussy, cheer on Africans running a ball up the field, and as long as he has a new truck every 5 years it’s all good if his neighbours are all mexicans.So we will continue to be replaced by a more serious people until we “un” deracinate. And really not sure how to do that, other than making sure our side has large families and raises them to be globohomo resistant.

Most of not all of them were paid stooges for the wealthy elites.
Just as the podcaster has made the talk radio host obsolete, the internet grifter has replaced the CIA funded Buckleys of the right.
The David Frenchs and Douhats no longer have an audience.  Instead of conservative thought leaders being beholden to elite interests, they cater to the lowest common denominator to get internet crowdsourced funding.

        It’s interesting how both sides seem stuck in the past. I actually get to talk with teenagers and the liberal ones speak as though it’s 1965. It’s just blacks and Whites, and how White racism is keeping down blacks.Sure, they throw in the occasional “People of Color” comment, but they focus exclusively on blacks. It’s as though the past 50 years haven’t happened. They don’t notice that Hispanics are 25% of the population, almost double blacks. Asians and Indians, who are they?Neither side has a real vision for the future because that would mean acknowledging that Whites will be a minority. Neither sides wants to contemplate a country where Whites aren’t in charge. The Right knows that it has no place in such as a country. The Left knows that it would no longer have an enemy and would now have to figure out how to get along and run things.Neither side has vision for the future because the future is going to be a lot nastier than the past.

            Yes, this is an important observation. I live in a ~30% white (and most are boomers) part of the Toronto area and traditional white politics are completely dead.The major groups are Hindus, Sikhs, Arabs and Chinese. Generational warfare is absent. Wokeness is absent. Homo parades don’t exist. Crime is low, there are no homeless, streets are clean. Progress also stagnates – they have low motivation. General community (like neighbourhoods) is non existent – but ethnic/religious communities are strong. Bike lanes are not even debated – highway widening and new condo developments are always being promoted. Outright racism is pretty low, but everyone knows who’s in what group and put their own group interests first.The truth is that leftism is also obsolete in this situation, not just the right. For instance, at the small BLM / homo parades in the area, it’s basically white degenerates acting performatively as an ever diminishing minority. Hindus/Sikhs/Muslims cringe a bit and then just keep doing whatever. It falls on deaf ears.The right is also obsolete, for instance the anti – lockdown protests are all white people too. The non-whites don’t participate, they say yes sir Mr. Trudeau we are following social distancing and then not follow it at all.It’s not all bad, in fact there’s many positives here. We can learn from this arrangement. The problem is that right and left, even in this obviously majority non white place most of our people are still living in an individualist fantasyland where it’s still 1980, as the real world passes them by. And Patel surely loves NHL, Canada, Harleys, and grilling juicy burgers as much as Boomer Jim, he just has darker skin 😊

                    Yep. I remember the last 4th of July, Newsom said no parties, no fireworks, etc. And what did the people of LA do? Have grilling parties, shoot off a boat load of illegal fireworks, ignore masks, etc.
It was amusing watching the local news media freak out seeing the entire night sky full of exploding salutes.
It was one of the best 4th’s ever.

                Thanks for this.
I’ve been wondering about two things of late.1. What are the exemplars of successful none-white societies that the left is aiming for?2. What instances do we have, within the larger structure of the West do we have of functioning multi-racial, minority white communities?
Your answer to the latter is interesting because while you are long on the Hindu, you are light on the Dindu,

                    1. This is a whole other topic. The truth is that there are none – at least not the kind they’d like to live in. Saudi Arabia (and the whole gulf) and China are some decent examples of functional non white societies. Of course these are not democracies or egalitarian or diverse at all. Leftist ideas seem to be more about destroying the European races as opposed to building anything else though.2. Again, there are none. In a place with Hindus, Punjabis, Arabs, and Pakistanis, everyone is a minority. The communities are based on ethnic and religious lines. There is not much of a “greater society”. Even among Muslims, there’s the Paki mosque, the Saudi mosque, the Ismaili people.Atomized whites are at a disadvantage. Mohammed hires his cousin for the job. Patel hires an H1-B. Dong is spying for the CCP. “Jim” hires ‘whoever is best for the job’. So good luck even starting a career as more and more non whites fill up corporations. It’s still ok *for now* but in 20 years the number of boomers still hiring ‘the best person for the job’ will be precariously low.The exceptions are religious whites. There is still networking and communities being formed there. A boomer at church is happy to “refer” a young person in at their company. That’s really the only suggestion I have for now. Another model are French-Canadians who are a highly ethnocentric white group. They will not speak a word to Anglos if they don’t have to.

                    Punjabis and Arabs are wanna be Dindus, especially 2nd generation “assimilated” ones. Believe it or not Punjabi rap music is even more hideous than regular rap music.They are more annoying than Dindus but less dangerous physically. They all hate whitey too and are great at scamming the system. Because they’re higher intelligence I believe they will be a bigger problem long term.Though I want nothing to do with Dindus I do respect them for “keeping it real” and given their low intelligence levels would be easily dealt with by a white population (or Hindu population) that is not totally cucked.

                “For instance, at the small BLM / homo parades in the area, it’s basically white degenerates acting performatively as an ever diminishing minority. Hindus/Sikhs/Muslims cringe a bit and then just keep doing whatever. It falls on deaf ears.”
Damn, this is the equivalent of someone going to the neighbours house to show off his degenerate porn collection.The neighbours are repulsed, but the leftist instead of being ashamed of himself, he thinks he’s a brave visionary who has transcended the dogma of the past.

Now that BLM, sorry, Black History Month is over, the company has switched from daily indoctrination about blacks, equity, and the racisms to…..
Daily indoctrination about ASIANS, equity, and the racisms.
Left unsaid is WHO is oppressing the Asians.  (Harvard and Yale are not acceptable answers).
HR departments a scourge on morale.  Classic strategy though: everyone in the company will hate each other after a few more years of this: perfect opportunity to expand HR to deal with the “problem”!

            I should also add that this place has alot of “older” immigrants. Educated people who came here before the woke started, probably late 80s/early 90s into the mid 00s.
The newer ones seem alot more hostile, especially Punjabis / Muslims.
And their kids / 3nd gen pretty much lose their positive cultural attributes and basically follow a cheap imitation of African American culture. Especially the males.

            Before I retired from the professing biz (aka “when I stopped giving a crap what the administration thought”), I’d regularly ask classes of undergraduates to estimate the percentage of “African Americans” in the population. Estimates varied, but usually the answer was “25-35%”. I asked “what percentage of Americans are gay?” and got a similar answer.
“So look around,” I’d say. “According to you guys, every third kid in here is a gay Black. Where on earth did you get that idea?”
Blank stares. The propaganda REALLY works, y’all.

When asked about how many people in the US were black, answers seemed to range from 25 to 70%. Most people interviewed were under the impression that America was half black.

                    It’s weird, isn’t it? The “worldwide” BLM protests that happened last year stunk of fake and gay, but they also happened in Japan. People protest all the time and do street demonstrations in Tokyo. It’s a lesson learned from the 1960s when national riots occured. There, the diet hamfisted that one and got a lot of people killed. Now they figure it’s better to let college kids blow off some steam as long as they don’t get violent. Still, even though BLM just gave them something to march around about that month, the turnout was pathetic and there were an inordinate amount of white foreigners in the crowd.

            My mother and sister firmly believe that American blacks are systematically oppressed. That black males could all be like that very nice,very personable Will Smith if only White Americans would stop endlessly oppressing them. Thanks to decades of indoctrination by the state broadcaster the BBC they simply cannot be talked out of this belief.I believe that blacks are their own worst enemies and that a black male/female could start a fight in an empty house. However to say that risks being forever labelled as an incorrigible racist.

        Douglas Murray can be insightful on occasion, but otherwise, conservatism is an intellectual desert.He’s stone-solid when it comes to Islam – a freebie for kosher-right shills. But still, he went on Al Jazeera and told all the camel fuckers straight to their faces that their god was a perverse joke.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NBh6DhmYcIIn connexion to this he related an anecdote about Richard Dawkins: Dawkins had gone on Al J. himself, railing about muh Jesus and about Jewism, when the host asked: “but what about Allah? Is he a fairy tale too?”So Dawkins blanched and came up with this: “I don’t know that much about Islam”.

        The intellectual backbone is gone now, all that can happen is watch most of western and Christian society continue in freefall.
The heirs to the great minds of the Right’s past are honing their ideas, teaching and fortifying generations to come. Hopefully in decades to come they will be ready to create a new home for people like us but understand it will be new and not resurrected America. I hope and pray that true Christianity will be part of that also. I don’t see any other way.

            Yeah, the cowardness is what I despise.  Charles Murray had the balls, and perhaps naivete, to publish the bell curve. It provides the unassailable argument against white systemic racism explaining poor black academic performance. Does anyone at conservative inc. use it? Hell no, easier to just let the whites be painted as morally deficient. Lolz, I’ve gently prodded Steve Hayward to even acknowledge that such an argument exists. Got banned for my trouble, heh.  I was a NR reading stalwart as little as 10 years ago. Today, I find myself despising those fuckers more than the child diddlers in the Catholic Church.

                The cowardliness of whites disgusts me.We see it from boomers at globocorp. Firing good young white people over petty disagreements. Hiring POC morons so nobody challenges / “threatens” their ideas. Disparaging young “millenials” when it’s a very specific group of “millenials” who are lazy, fucking everyone else over. White execs constantly promoting BLM and other wokeness and jerking each other off over how progressive they are. These aren’t the small hat people but full on crackers.Basically fucking over everyone else coming after them, but hey they got theirs. I hope they get the pillow treatment as they’re dying alone, on their way to hell, in the nursing home. And that is too generous.

                Murray has a book coming out in June called “Facing Reality:  Two Truths About Race in America.”  From the description at Amazon:“The charges of white privilege and systemic racism that are tearing the country apart fIoat free of reality. Two known facts, long since documented beyond reasonable doubt, need to be brought into the open and incorporated into the way we think about public policy: American whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians have different violent crime rates and different means and distributions of cognitive ability.”I gotta believe that Amazon will pull the book when Jamal’s white upper middle class enablers start raising hell about it.

            What is an intellectuals backbone and where is it located?
The Intellectuals? They’ll be with us- Goebbels
The intellectuals are humanity’s eternal race of whores – Moldbug.
We can now review the intellectuals during the struggle against Communism…nah.
There is no such thing as intellectuals with backbones.They sing for their supper and thats all.

            It’s good.
The main thesis is that the 1964 Civil Rights Act created a parallel extra-Constitutional series of rights that ultimately gutted and subjugated the actual Constitution, and is doing so with ever increasing vigor.
Good for gateway discussions for the ‘muh Consitushn’ types on our side who say all we need to do is get back to the basics.
Use caution with the “freedom of association” argument.  That’s some straight up racisms right there, but it’s the essence of a free society.  Again, gutted by the 1964 CRA (and follow up legislation)

            Those are the words of a party that is dead.They had become so corrupt over the last 25 years that they drove out the few half-way intelligent and populist types in the party. Now all they are, are meat puppets for BigTech and Wall Street.Trump tried to bring the party back but they hated him so much they destroyed the country to get rid of him.  Trump’s failure was not understanding the GOP was by his time a party that was openly hostile to White Americans and to having a happy an prosperous working and middle-class in the country. If it didn;t involve giving fellatio to billionaire hedge fund operators and CEO’s they weren’t interested.

        All the smart people on the right thinking about how to set things in order didn’t do much else other than think about it.  The cultural and societal rot has continued apace despite our former deep thinkers.The sooner the clown car veers off the road, the better.  Then those of us on this side of the great divide can start picking up the pieces, while leaving “them” to their fate or perhaps bringing that fate to fruition.  The only platform I want to see “conservative” mediocrities and their leftard brothers and sisters on is the type with a falling trap door…

            I’m reliably informed it was an “insurrection” on the level of 1861 when:
11 states voted to succeed,
raised actual armies,
engaged in a fight that led to the deaths of 2% of the population (equivalent to 6.5 million deaths today),
wounding about 3x that (about 20 million equivalent today),
drafted/volunteered 80% of men between age 18-45 in the south and 50% of men between age 18-45 in the north.
This is why we still have 25,000 troops, gates, and razor wire in the Capitol
