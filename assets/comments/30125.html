        Totally off topic but on my mind. Imagining a publicly accessible AI platform powered by El-Salvadorian volcanos, tuned to give the right answers and be as accurate as possible. Since there is no government on earth that would tolerate their citizens having access to such a thing it will never happen. Think about that too. If  a very accurate and useful AI tool were possible, there is no government in the world that would allow you access to it and there never will be.

            Totally off topic as well, but I tried ChatGPT the other night for the first time. Yes, I was a virgin.All I can say is they have a lot of work to do. I asked it how long I could expect to reach $1 million (a la Dr. Evil) if I started with $576.25 doubling my money every 21 days “using safe Treasury bills.” It’s response? 11.07 years. It showed a complicated financial formula to prove its work. ofc it only takes seven or eight months — i forget exactly — using very simple math. I don’t think ChapGPT will be replacing many financial advisor jobs any time soon.

                To make it so chatgpt (or whatever) can’t tell you how far from the nearest black kid you have to live to avoid having your bike stolen, they’ve made it lie about *everything*.
Nerds aren’t smart enough to do nerd things anymore. An algorithmic fix to make a chatbot only lie about shitlib shit is *maybe* a few days’ work for one guy. All of them combined can’t do it at all.
If this made you think of “The Mythical Man-Month,” you’re fired.

                    In a way this is the best outcome for AI development.  The more people see that the AI just parrots what its moronic creators think, the less inclined they are to view it as a God instead of just a tool that data mines how many times you’ve farted near Siri or Alexa.

        Late to this thread and I have only two comments.1.  Is Gretchen Witmer an alternative to Gavin Newsome?Michigan is a swing state and Witmer might be more attractive to the box wine ladies as the first president of vagina.  She is, of course, a dreadful person (the Z-man opined during the contrived covid crisis that she was a dominatrix with an entire state to whipà but that may be a plus in this day and age.2.  How will minorities, particularly blacks, react to yet another Democratic presidential candidate who is white.  They won’t vote Republican, but a low turnout black vote might be costly for the Democrats in certain states.  Maybe Stacey Abrams as vice president?

        At 27:41 Zman makes a comment basically that DeSantis seems to be moving towards the establishment. I agree. I claim no secret insight, but earlier today elsewhere I made a very similar observation. I basically said that as a FL resident I approved of many things that he’d done for the state, but that I had misgivings about just how true to consevative principels he was. Although I did not mention these, the man man has served prior terms in Congress. On the good side that means he has some experience in politics. On the down side, he’s probably in someone’s sphere of influence. Considering he signed an anti-hate bill while visiting Israel a few months ago, I think people can guess what types of influence. Or perhaps, just trying to join the club by ingratiating himself to his betters?By the way, I rarely make predictions and they’re usually wrong. No matter. I think DeSantis’s apparent attempt to mainstream himself will backfire. Trump, for all his flaws, is the [dissident] right’s champion (hopefully not “martyr”). I voted for him for Governor last year. Absent hard proof that DeSantis truly upholds values that most of us here do, I’m for Trump.

        Trump’s point, they are not after him, he’s just in the way and you are next, is correct. Arrests will not stop with Trump. Already there is a press/Newsom led agitation to arrest DeSantis for sending illegals to Sacramento and Manhattan as “cruel and unusual punishment” that is a “violation of illegals civil rights.” The Regime could order the arrest of DeSantis, over that or the Alphabet people in schools, and even occupy Florida in a super-sized version of Ike sending US troops to Little Rock to enforce desegration. This time for a drag queen in every school.And I think they will do both, i.e arrest DeSantis and Occupy Florida. The US is in an active social revolt over the Alphabet people. While it started with White males, it has spread: to Armenians and Hispanics in Glendale CA, in Hammtrack MI among Muslims, to all sorts of groups. It is not as much about the Alphabet people per se though their increasing depraved antics generate increased disgust which is the aim of Alphabet people everywhere throughout time. But rather protest is dissatisfaction with the Regime and the real large and sudden drop in living standards. When people need to carefully consider what food they buy when they had no need for generations, that generates real anger. Since their wages never match inflation. The Regime knows this hence their desire for first widespread arrests of troublemakers like DeSantis over culture (knowing it is a flashpoint that is a real danger no doubt modeled by various data scientists in Google) then the nearly 200,000 the Regime has collected data on, then a much larger group. So arrests in stages: DeSantis and a few other governors, then various dissidents not just “our guys” but Muslim, Catholic, other leaders. Then the at large normal White people the latter driven by the moral certainty that Whites are genetically evil and bear hereditary blood guilt. Which is the moral center of the regime.Don’t think the Canadian trucker stunt pulled by ex FT staffer Chrystia Freeland, grand-daughter of an infamous Ukrainian Yahtzee, of seizing bank accounts of dissidents who donated as little as $20 to the truckers, has not gained admiration in the Regime. They can now claim “Ultra MAGA WN threats” of most Pale People, arrest them, and three-fer. Funnel their seized property through Blackrock or Vanguard or what have you, for that cut (dont’ forget the Big Guy!) and then a small piece to black people for reparations; the way lots of connected Californian big shots like the Gettys, Browns, Newsoms, etc. got big bucks off Japanese property seized during WWII; and then offer a choice in Manzanar 2.0 like what the Nisei got.The objection is, this is too stupid, extreme, and destructive. I counter with, “never underestimate Joe’s ability to F— things up,” and Alphabet People day at the White House with gyrating topless Alphabet people. On a large level, repression does not ever stop in a regime like this. Without an obvious Napoleon, Xi Xinping, or other supreme leader, repressive oligarchies just degenerate into mass repression until someone pops up to reset the mass terror. I think in part the Big Guy’s payoffs are the stop sign held up by Regime elements who do not want to go full Pol Pot fearing they could be next. I could be wrong on all of this — but I don’t think you can bet wrong on the utter stupidity of the powerful elements of the regime.

            They better hope there aren’t too many more kids like the ones at the HS in Vermont. Not real good optics when you are cracking down on school kids. Of course the easy lesson there is don’t try to force the kids to wear Pride clothes, but coexistence isn’t enough for these folks, they want subservience.

            The insane LGBT agenda pushed from the top is kind of an eye opener. The coalition of the fringes was happy to go along with the LGBT movement in exchange for other things, like open borders and other standard left wing policies. As long as the LGBT stuff was de facto a white person’s movement.But they couldn’t stop themselves. Suddenly every child needs to attend a Drag Queen parade. An entire month of primary school class is devoted to rainbows and homosexual relations.This situation is just not acceptable for: (as you said) Muslims, Armenians, Hispanics, Sikhs, etc. on top of the MAGAs, Christians, and conservative white men who always opposed this stuff.The screaming teacher in Edmonton summed it up well – “we” celebrated Ramadan in our school, and we expect “you” to celebrate LGBT. We are all oppressed minorities. Of course a laughably ignorant and naive mindset (for so many reasons) but they really do believe their own nonsense.They either tone down the LGBT agenda or they lose the coalition of the fringes. Which was pretty obvious but they couldn’t resist the urge to escalate. Never underestimate their ability to f*ck things up, but the overreach this year suggests a regime with declining management capabilities. And a regime that truly believes its BS instead of seeing it pragmatically, as a tool.Also a good reminder that they are not infallible and not geniuses.

                Outside of Muslims the coalition if the fringes doesn’t care about the anal revolution one way or the other enough to change their politics. Asians want the real estate and remaining school slots of white people. Blacks and Hispanics, outside of Hispanic working class men, want gemme Dat and more immigration.

            ” The Regime knows this hence their desire for first widespread arrests of troublemakers like DeSantis over culture (knowing it is a flashpoint that is a real danger no doubt modeled by various data scientists in Google) then the nearly 200,000 the Regime has collected data on, then a much larger group. ”These are the same assclowns who cannot manufacture enough ammunition for “their” side in a proxy war. I don’t doubt they would want to do something like you suggest, but strongly suspect they cannot. Additionally, the revolt against transgenderism is starting in their own backyards. The smarter ones want to de-escalate now but they admittedly might not have full operational control, as you suggested. Things are in fact spiraling out of control but given the track record they likely can’t effectively do squat about it. They are hated back just as much now by far more people.

        There is an inundation of Blacks Wuz Unbelievable Geniuses who were destroyed by whitey every time they got off the ground “news” stories out in recent days. I sensed a new escalation. I was right. Now blacks are finding their great-great-great grandfather’s property deeds and saying, without proof of course, that they were kicked off of their land with violence. It is all being ginned up to sell reparations in California.This one is in wine country. I wonder if Pelosi worries if this is too close to home:https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-californians-stolen-land-reparations-rcna84970?utm_source=pocket-newtabThe Left has no idea what rabid dogs they have gotten into bed with to create a one-party state. They may think they can contain the dispossession, but I don’t think it will all go down that way. Jeffries looks mental, rabid and bent on revenge.

        Man, the GOP choices do suck – Trump (who while fun, will be totally hamstringed if not ruling from Leventhworth),  DeSantis, who is the “establishment’s” Trump which means totally harmless to TPTB, or the based Indian Shwarma or whatever his name is.  Makes me think (if Trump is off the ballot by the time the primaries role around) to go RFK.

                RFK is the only one that speaks to issues like Trump 1.0 did. Clearly, no wiggle.
Whether that means he can change anything, who knows. But when he talks, you don’t cringe. Plus he has a blood debt to settle.

                I have kept my old registration as a Democrat for two reasons:1) For some little, raggedy bit of camouflage in Blue Tick Hell NJ;2) To be able to fuck with the mainstream Democrat candidate, to some small degree; i.e., viting for Sanders to spit in their eye.
It ain’t much, but every little bit of sand in the gears is to the good.

        Every presidential election is the result of a Grand Conspiracy. Since 2016 was the Grand Conspiracy That Failed, the usual suspects panicked. Their fat thumbs were so heavy on the scale in 2020 that even the most uninformed saw through the machinations. That may have been the final straw. It wouldn’t surprise me if 2024 marks the end of the present party system. But if you’re right and they regain control in 2024, it just increases the odds of a greater breakup down the road.

            Well, since a conspiracy is, legally, just 2 or more people working toward a common goal, and performing 1 or more acts in furtherance of the goal….pretty much everything in government or big business is a conspiracy…That doesn’t matter, of course, if the goal is not illegal…

        Regarding the Great Fear, the primary concern was that the Royal family would sneak out of France (which they tried), cut a deal with the Austrians (which they also tried), and return to France at the head of an Austrian army to crush the rebellion. By this time in the Revolution the writing was on the wall and much of the Aristocracy had decided to take leave of France so as to keep their heads firmly attached to their shoulders. Aristocratic families formed the backbone of the officer corps of the French Army, so their exodus left the French army headless and exposed.The Biden regime has thrown open our Southern border, allowing millions of military-age males who possess no particularly useful economic skills to enter the country. Recently, the military has announced expedited citizenship for service programs as a recruiting tactic. It does not take a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist to put two and two together to conclude that they intend to build an army of foreigners which will be used against the native population of the US.As an historical aside, the storming of the Bastille is perhaps the greatest example of puffing in modern history. In historical legend heroic members of the mob tore down the Bastille brick by brick using their bare, bloody hands to liberate the hundreds of unjustly held political prisoners of the revolution. In reality, the mob entered the Bastille unopposed when one of the guards accidentally opened the outer gates. Once inside, they found six or seven prisoners, all but one of whom were held there due to insanity. The sane prisoner was a young Aristocrat who had been committed to the Bastille by his family as punishment for, basically, excessive partying and womanizing. This was a custom widely available to aristocrats at the time–if only the Biden family had utilized it with Hunter they would not be in this mess.

            Canada already opened its military to “Permanent Residents” last year, aka anybody on earth with a pulse, who managed to complete some paperwork and get on a plane.Yes, quite clear where this is all headed. In fact this already happened in the Union army during the American civil war. This time, they won’t be Irishmen.During the Freedom Convoy the white cops seemed to have no problem cracking skulls, but they will be replaced by foreigners anyways. There’s always that 1% chance that a white cop might refuse to fire on his own people… Everyone else would do it for free, with relish.

                It’s wishful thinking that white cops/soldiers won’t turn on the population when ordered. Find me a time in history when they refused such orders. Few and far between. Regime media will of course prep the propaganda ground ahead of time so that the orders make sense.

        This isn’t the first time I’ve read (even on this blog!) that the Deep State is engineering some operation to remove the Brandon entity from 2024. So far it has proven to be remarkably resilient to these things. I really think if permanent DC wanted him gone this bribery thing would be all over the mainstream media, but it’s not. Right now it appears more like a plaything for conservacucks. Plus, the Brandon entity is doing whatever the bureaucrats want. They’re willing to play ball. If he dies in office or his senility becomes too great for even CNN to deny (something I absolutely cannot imagine happening, it’s CNN), I think Kamala is willing to play ball too. It’s not an issue. They’re shutting down the primaries so he doesn’t even need to pretend to campaign like he did in 2020, and they have democracy fortification for the general. It’s fine. The system is working, from permanent DC’s POV, as well as it should. I am that, for a few minutes, they pondered the dangers of arresting and prosecuting their political opponents, and I suppose in the moment they would have preferred not to go down that route, but the visceral thrill of it soon overrode any caution.

            The only reason the Regime had not previously arrested its political opponents was due to international opinion. It apparently no longer cares. My guess is the GAE is downsizing to its European colonies and feels it has them in its pocket. The Ukraine war is aimed just as much at any potential European independence than it is at Russia.

                Arrest is the second to last option.
The Regime’s first options are coopting adversaries with money and or sex.
They’re second option is blackmailing them.
They’re third option is destroying the person’s reputation by releasing the blackmail info and or flat out lying about them.
All three of those failed against Trump for various reasons.The failure of publicly destroying his reputation has been trued repeatedly, and the regime seems genuinely flummoxed by it’s failure.

                    Wisely or by luck, Trump never tried to pretend to be who he wasn’t.  Similar to Berlusconi (RIP), being a womanizer only enhanced his appeal to his supporters so that option was a non starter.

            That’s what I was going to say. The “conspiracy theories”arethe observable reality. The official line is manifestly not in accord with observable reality.It needs to be said, however, that many of the things label conspiracy theories are not true, either. If the liberal narrative is like the basic religion of modernity, many of the conspiracy theories are its protestant churches and splinter sects, differing in points of dogma and observance but not really questioning the underlying structure.You notice this a lot in dissident circles. Dissidents can be extremely rabid in defending their heresies. I catch all kinds of grief, for example, when I point out to 9/11 truthers that no, the “laws of physics” do not invalidate the official story of the towers collapsing. At this point they have me pegged as shill and they hurly every epithet in the book at me, so it does me know good to insist that I don’t believe the official story, either. There was more going on behind the scenes on 9/11 than the official story admits (like a former CIA asset slipping his leash and turning against his masters), but controlled demolition was not a par of it.Yes, Virginia, there really were hijackers and there really were planes. The towers fell because the hijackers crashed two jumbo jets into them. Because it had bee significantly damaged by falling debris, was burning, and because the whole area had been seismically destabilized by the gravity-bomb effect of the the first two towers falling. There was no controlled demolition, nor was any necessary. And none of this negates the fact that the government really is full of duplicitous liars and sociopaths. The one claim does not prove or disprove the other.

                The problem is there are not very many videos of large planes crashing into huge towers to compare to 9/11.  But there are a fare number of controlled demolitions.  It looked like a controlled demolition (falling relatively uniformly right into its footprint).  But maybe that’s just how towers go when they get struck from an object midway up from the side.  I don’t know.
The more important conspiracy is not how the towers physically went down, but who knew about it, when, why and to what purpose?

                    This is really the only thing that I believe about 9-11, namely that someone had decided that it was time to move to rule through sheer deceit and ultimately – terror. The old system, however inaccurately and hypocritically, provided for open debate, challenge to authority, and a means to use reason and evidence to steer policy. *Someone* decided that it was time for that to end.It’s also become apparent, in the 20+ years since, that the specifics of the mechanism used to usher in this bizarre new tyranny were not that relevant. For years, after all, it was people on the nominal Right who were apologizing for the crimes of the Bush regime and ridiculing anyone who questioned the official 9-11 narrative. The nominal targets of the early repression, Muslims, also didn’t really matter because the purpose was simply to create this new system of terror and permanent crisis and assure that this power was in the intended hands. The point of 9-11 and a lot of the lies of the Bush era was to construct this new weapon, not necessarily to assign its targets.In hindsight I think this makes sense too. Muslims, even today, are a very small minority in the US. Constructing a giant fraud and novel systems of repression and terror to target them made little sense. That’s because they never were the real targets, all of us were.

                The way i put it is that the official story of 9-11 is the truth.But not the whole truth – just a curated portion of it.  Mixed in with some misdirection.
That’s the way of globohomo.  They don’t outright lie,  they always have some facts in their narratives. But they skew them, removing the context and include misdirections to create a false impression.

        Marko – “Every regime needs the illusion of popular consent.”This is a really important point to consider. For years, I would have agreed with this. I hope Zman will write on this specific topic. Because I’m not so sure it’s true anymore. I wonder what others here think.All the “flexing” on Coof, the “rainbow/tran” stuff, St. George, the blatant censorship and election fortification make me think that we are past the point where popular consent is necessary for the regime. If you accept this possibility, the range of outcomes for the upcoming “election” cycle is far wider than any of us can imagine at this point.

            I think the key here is “illusion.”  When you control practically all the means of communicating information, and constantly belittle any other takes as “conspiracy”, that illusion is not so hard to maintain.  Calling anyone who “noticed” the odd coordinated pause in counting ballots and then an 80% shift to the losing candidate a “conspiracy nut” is one way of creating this illusion.  The average normie either won’t learn of or seek out the truth or fear being ostracized for noticing.  Por encourager les autres.

        Good observation by Z here. Twenty years ago I dutifully believed almost everything I was told by the authorities. Now I believe virtually none of it and have far greater trust in non-authoritative, i.e. unofficial, sources of information. I do not believe I’m an outlier. Far from it.

        The layers of power and influence above the level of U.S. politicians is documented, quite real, highly conspiratorial and not theoretical.  The exact makeup of these elements is typically inexact and in flux, however.To me, the unreasonable and unsubstantiated position is the belief that Joe Biden runs American domestic and foreign policy.  I do not believe the evidence supports that assumption.When lying is the standard of a ruling body, of course the peeps will seek alternate routes to the truth.  This opens them up to further scamsters and predators, but also potentially opens them to the truth, which is objective and does exist.

            Truth exists because at its most basic, truth is reality.  The“first cause” so to speak.  The problem is that this “reality” is not easily observable, especially for the common man, hence conspiracy theories.  Conspiracy theories are simply the blind men describing the elephant from the parts they are “observing”.

                ray: “truth… is objective and does exist”But what if an ancient race of sooth-saying shape-shifting hand-rubbing happy merchants [the origins of which dated to the Bronze Age] had so perfected their techniques of mass mesmerization &amp; mass hypnotization that the Narrative which they sold to their fantasy-infatuated customers became, over time, to those customers, a deeper &amp; moar powerful &amp; moar worshipful set of truisms than was even Truth itself?How do you save souls which, when informed that two plus two does NOT equal five, will react not just violently, but in fact MURDEROUSLY?Will we live to see the wailing and gnashing of their teeth?

                    Since the end of WWII these people have spent trillions of dollars and billions of words constructing the reality that the typical White griller “believes in”. I would contend though that, like any big budget Hollywood production (which seems to be the template they use for everything), it’s all been suspension of disbelief in the interest of “having a good time” more than active belief itself.The spell of the movies is easily broken if a fire breaks out in the theater. This is what may touch off the endgame for the regime. When there’s no more prospect of having that good time and people actually feel in danger, there’s no telling what they may do or what they may come to believe.c matt above claims that they “control practically all the means of communicating information”. I think he’s wrong on that. This is actually one part of the illusion they never fully secured. There are plenty of cracks in the theater walls where daylight gets in even now. In fact, this blog itself is one such. They may attempt now to go “full Soviet” and strangle the internet and shut off dissent but that itself could touch off open violence and bring down the regime.

                    Bourbon —I hope I have not given the wrong impression on this blog, and if I have then that’s my fault for lack of clarity.  I did not mean to misrepresent myself.I’m not a Jew hater, or a black hater for that matter.  There are blacks and folks that used to be Jews in my church.  If I wanted them out I’d toss them out.As for Jews and ‘mass mesmerization’, both Babylonian and Egyptian sorcery were well-advanced beyond what the ancient Tribes could muster . . . leaving aside the ark, which is Something Else.  So I don’t see apostate Jews as the masterminds behind the current manufactured chaos.  They’re not, because I know who is.When I say ‘sorcery’ I mean the combo of illusion, technology, and demonic aid to bring about highly effective, and persuasive, phenomena.  Good examples are certain of the numerous Marian ‘visitations’, or the instance of Moses before Pharaoh’s court and its magicians.Apologies to all here if I gave the impression that I’m on the It’s the Jews or It’s the Blacks team.I have published essays of some length concerning the disastrous influence of many twentieth-century apostate-Jewish women upon America and the other Anglo nations.But I don’t hate all Jews due to that, as (like blacks e.g.) ‘Jews’ are far from being a unified entity.  I evaluate the tendencies and works of the various Jewish factions just like I do with every other group or sub-group.

                A sure sign a conspiracy is false is if it makes rational sense—follows a “chain” of logical steps, material motives, top-down structures that aren’t the conspiracy itself, etc. That’s not how people act or how they’re motivated, except in petty crime (white).People who conspire against others want to see others hurt. Rational incentives may exist, superfluously. It’s more fun to run down a child in your Ferrari than in a ’94 Taurus, but it’s not the point. The purpose of x is x.“Green” conspiracies, now proceeding openly, are exemplary. Politicians psych themselves up to commit horrors, set the horror machine in motion, then pretend and insist (truly believe) that they’re not doing anything. “Nobody’s trying to take away your [fill in the blank],” she smirks and the press smirks back—as the police prepare to kill you for having it. When they do, you’ll have done it to yourself, by believing in conspiracies.Deduction is a temptation. Projecting how you (or homo economicus) would act in “the same situation” is a mistake. The situation is *them*.

It’s very difficult for Normie-Con Grillers to contemplate the horrifying reality of Sadistic Psychopathy.
That’s a zone deep in The Abyss which simply terrifies them.
They do not want to go there, and they do not want to ponder The Horror.

Anyway, I liked what you said about the meme war being important but ultimately, it needs to go to meatspace too. Otherwise we end up fighting our battles with the system alone. I know it’s terrifying to “come out” but our enemies did that and then took over everything. We will not take any of that back posting cartoon frogs on the internet.

                        Pozymandias: “it needs to go to meatspace too”My point is that – at this particular point in time – conquering the world of abstractions [rhetorical lexicons, psychological conditionings, gestalts, zeitgeists, etc] is infinitely moar important than conquering square-footages of real estate in meatspace.First we win the Language War.Then we win the hearts &amp; minds.Then we go physical.Plastering “It’s okay to be White” signs on telephone poles is infinitely moar powerful than throwing a molotov cocktail at a Planned Murd3rh00d ab0rtuary.Win the Language.Win the Rhetoric.Win the Psychological Conditioning.Own the outlooks &amp; attitudes &amp; points-of-views &amp; aspirations &amp; intentions and then, all of a sudden, before you know it, everything else will fall naturally into place.==========PS: I don’t mean to jinx us, but I have the strangest feeling that all of our combined work, for the last ten or fifteen years [as samizdat dissidents in the sociological gulag], is FINALLY beginning to show some signs of having been worth the effort.Plus we are now, post-COVID, armed with vastly more insight into the human condition than we had acquired pre-COVID.In 2023, our knowledge of mass-mesmerization &amp; mass-hypnotization techniques simply dwarfs our pathetic misunderestimation of them as recently as 2019.

            Here’s a perfectly valid opening for that near-constant feature of this blog, Layabout offering a Nietzsche quote. Done groaning? Fine, I’ll continue. Central to his philosophy is perspectivism. As an “anti-realist” he denied earlier philosphers had found “The Truth.” They had found nothing of the sort, he asserted. They had, at best, found a new perspective, an interpretation. The ultimate reality is like a text that we are denied access to. What we do have is interpretation, a particular perspective. We can find endless examples of this. For a long time, the Earth was the center of the universe. Along came men like Copernicus who offered a new quite different interpretation which slowly gained acceptance. At the risk of stating the obvious, but it’s needful: the underlying physical reality (the relation of the various celestial game pieces) did not change.

        All that is predicated on Normie and Griller and Boomer continuing to sit on the side lines, drinking beer (except for Bud Lite!!!!!), watching the sportzball game and eating potato chips in the most obnoxious flavour possible.If people start to get hungry, and things get really bad – the bullets will start to fly. Regardless of your politics, it is getting harder and harder to keep Normie on the couch watxhing TV. Whatever America is these days… it definitely ISN’T a class society anymore. Thanks to the internet The Beautiful People of the ruling class are no longer all that beautiful. Fully 1/3 of Americans see those guys for the perfidious scum they are, and in a corner, backed against the wall…? You can bet the teeth and claws will come out and bullets will start to fly. The nation can no longer get along with itself. I am hearing my fellow stubfarts and Yesterday Men speaking openly of “a national divorce” for Americans, while dreaming of one for us up here in Canada. Given the complete moral and intellectual bankruptcy on the other side of the political divide… I think that deprived of their meal ticket, they will seek to impose their parasitism on us at any cost.The next civil war is going to be LIT.

            With civil liberties stripped, economic freedom will be next on the block. There is dissolution and fragmentation underway even now. Once food and warmth become hard to get, and that is coming, all bets are off.
As an aside, something interesting happened January 6th up your way. Trudeau, face full of rage and looking demonic rather than stupid for once, appeared on the tube and basically told the Deep State down here he had its back. There almost certainly will be cross-border and possibly international uprisings when whatever happens kicks off.

                That is probably public acknowledgement of the Greater North America project. He probably did it to:a) Continue to normalize open discussion of Canada + US integrationb) Say whatever it is he had to say to his handlers in DC.I think Patraeus and his financier buddies have been talking openly about dissolving the US and creating a giant former Canada + former US + former Mexico/Hounduras/Guatamala/Nicaragua … super state. Unless he is gaslighting since he became a war hero for losing in Iraq, it is a conspiracy he and his money men openly discuss.That probably explains the OK governor (white Republican), gleefully opening up OK as the hub of the SoAmerIndian part of the new nation. He has probably done his deal to be Consul of Colonia and preside over the helots there.Get ready for a part SouthAmerIndian, Haitian, Somali, Sudan, mix of Arab world peoples military.We need to keep some of our guys in the mix as a potential Aleric.

                    Yep the rumor is that the White House demanded the blockades at the border be cleared as they were screwing up the auto industry supply chains in the US. Plus it was terrible optics that the peaceful, tolerant liberal Canadians were rising up. Wouldn’t want the dirt people to get any bad ideas.The funniest thing was how it took the Canadian feds 4 weeks to clear what was essentially a traffic jam. Those ass clowns had to invoke the highest emergency order in the land to procure tow trucks and drivers to remove the vehicles.Under the Emergency Act, tow truck drivers were forced to operate as the feds directed, or risk huge fines and jail time. Rights “suspended”.Based on how long Biden kept the vax mandate in place on the US border, I think the North American (and especially Canadian) COVID fuckery was initially planned to go on a LOT longer , but the Freedom Convoy put an end to that. I was there, partly for myself, but mainly for the future of our children.

                        “Based on how long Biden kept the vax mandate in place on the US border, I think the North American (and especially Canadian) COVID fuckery was initially planned to go on a LOT longer”That’s a really sharp take. There was an absolute news embargo in the States on the trucker strike aftermath and the subsequent lifting of the mandates and so forth up there. That’s a tell and bolsters your point.In a strange way, Covid in significant ways was a good thing down here. Some individual states stood four-square against the central government after a point, and that precedent will prove valuable over time. On a personal level, it sorted the reliable in our lives from the unreliable. Trust in government collapsed across a wider spectrum. There always was going to be antagonism and confrontation between states and the federal government as things fragment and dissolve, but I even think it is possible, not probable but possible, that eventual dissolution could prove relatively non-violent. People within the nation saw what those outside it have seen from time to time, a basically incompetent but still relatively wealthy trainwreck of a country bullying yet floundering simultaneously as it lashes out. There is no certitude about when dissolution happens and if it even happens, but Covid gave a glimmer into what it will look like.

        Two things:1) Why are they doing this to Trump? As you noted, there are a lot of things that don’t make sense in their indictment of Trump. It might be cliché to reference 1984 these days, but here it goes. Why did the regime in 1984 not just kill the protagonist? They wanted to brainwash him and win his soul first. The regime wants to win over the minds and souls of Trump voters and make them admit that orange man bad. They need everyone to accept their narrative.2) Newsom is the easy pick for favorite of the establishment. I’ll give you two others that wouldn’t shock anyone: Hilary! Never underestimate the vanity of the Clintons. She hasn’t fully stepped out of the lime light (she does regular podcasts), and the Clintons still hold dirt and have allies in a lot of the establishment. Second, Michelle Obama. This has been whispered and rumored for a while. She’s a strong magical black lady, and certainly not as dumb as Kamala.

            You are quite right about the Power Structure’s need to impose ideological conformity. As long as there are dissenters and unbelievers, there will be mass propaganda and repression. But there will also be war because the GAE demands ideological conformity–and uniformity–not only domestically, but also abroad. Nations such a Russia, that largely defy and reject Leftist ideology, will continue to be targeted for violent destruction. That is why I sometimes say that the GAE will exert ideological imperium over the entire planet or it will reduce it to a flaming cinder.PS–In the Stupidity Sweepstakes, it’s a dam’ close race between Heels Up and Big Mike. If you ever glanced at Big Mike’s thesis at Princeton, you’ll know what I’m talking about.

                RT offers an “Analysis”  entitled “By using its nuclear weapons, Russia could save humanity from a global catastrophe.” I realize this is (Their) regime propaganda but it’s quite chilling reading.

                    He seems to think they can just nuke half a dozen cities without things escalating out of control.
I do think it’s possible they could nuke Kiev without the west retaliating immediately. But his whole point is to instill the fear of God in the hearts of western leaders, and it’s questionable if that alone would do it.

            The big problem with Newsome is that he is White. He’s not just White, he’s handsome, tall White man. He is everything the coalition of the fringes hates, and the coalition of the fringes is the gatekeeper there. It’s tough to underestimate just how much these people hate Whites. Despite how crazy it is, it really does seem as though Dems up and down are all in on this stuff. It’s why he is trying to burnish his reputation with these freaks by talking identity politics all day every day on Twitter, but unlike everything else, you can’t change your skin color. Now, maybe by the time he runs, Dems will have fully abolished primaries (in the name of democracy, of course), but I don’t see how he gets through that process especially if someone like, I don’t know, Hakeem Jeffries, or God forbid, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is out there too.

                This is quite possible and I’ve thought the same. Self-abasement and degradation may not be able to overcome his skin color. Biden easily won over blacks with promises of gibs, but white totalitarians and Hispanic nationalists mostly just played along. It would require him to embrace expressly anti-wbite platform positions and to kick labor unions to the curb. Doable? Maybe but that’s quite a balancing act.

                The part of the coalition of the fringes that hate him is miniscule.  Maybe true BLMrs and some blue haired freaks.  But your typical AWFL, suburban soccer mom, and wine-box cat lady, not to mention minority women, probably have rape fantasies about him.  He is Bill Clinton 2.0, all the charm and twice the looks.

                Newsome will come out as a tranny, because it’s the only way his burning ambition can be satisfied.
But unlike most of the mentally ill people who do this, his coming out will be entirely calculated and disingenuous.

            Trump is toast.  The Espionage Act he’s being prosecuted under is jailtime, not fines.The Pew Research published a good breakdown of federal prosecutions: in 2022, of those defendants dumb enough to go to a full blown trial, only 290 of 71,954 defendants were acquitted.That’s a 99.6% conviction rate.   Kangaroo Court, anyone?—Zman has brought up elsewhere another big problem: Attorneys who defend Trump are liable to lose their professional licenses to practice law.  There’s a very real and well funded movement to go after anyone who’ll put up a zealous defense in court on behalf of Trump.Trump is going to serve as an example to politicians and lawyers that there are lines you’re not allowed to color outside of.

        I don’t think the regime wants Trump off the ticket.  Just the opposite, they want to run against him because they believe they can beat him.  We will see a series of indictments and developments in the court cases from now until election day. This will keep him in the news and rob everyone else of oxygen. Trump’s behavior since 2020 has alienated a lot of supporters, GOP and Independents, who won’t vote for him again. No one wants to listen to a campaign of “you’re a crook” vs “you’re an insurrectionist” for the next year or so.If DeSantis or some other GOP candidate wants to get some traction, he should say he will pardon Trump.  He should also say he will pardon Biden because the US is not some banana republic where we jail the opposition.  Normie would like it, regardless that it is BS.I agree Newsome is running.  He could be a formidable candidate since a lot of suburban box wine ladies will flock to him.

            Ford arguably lost his election to Carter precisely because he pardoned Nixon.  I suspect that is on the mind of those candidates asked about the potential for a Trump pardon.  Of course, we are in a completely different world politically than we were in ‘76.

            I’d prefer that DeSantis pardon Trump, but I’d REALLY like to see him read Biden his Miranda rights on the Inauguration podium. But on second thought, announcing that both would be pardoned would probably appease the less vengeful among us. That said, my fond hope is that the full fury of an RDS administration be turned on BLM, Antifa, the Soroses, and the ADL under the RICO Act. (As one New Republic pundit (Jewish) noted some thirty five years ago, it’s funny that the first letters of the law spelled “RICO” and not “MORRIS.”). Concurrently, Schiffhead, et. al. should not be censured, but expelled. Forgiveness be damned. OK, not bloody likely, but in this era of despair, I need some aspiration wherever it can be found.

            The RNC wants Trump off the ticket because (1) they despise their base voters and (2) the big donors have already bought every other candidate, so no matter which other chump gets the nomination he’s Uniparty Approved. If despite all the dirty tricks they end up stuck with Trump, they’ll just go out &amp; throw the election anyway. See 2018 in particular where they essentially walked off the field to hand Trump a (D) Congress.The DNC probably doesn’t care as much as you’d think because they’ve got the election fortified anyway. They’ve got their own problem in trying to get Biden to walk away; the numbskull won’t take the message.The Deep State hates Trump with the passion of 1000 suns going nova, so they want him destroyed, discredited, imprisoned, and the message sent that nobody but nobody crosses them and gets away with it.

            Too many pardons would erode confidence in the regime just as effectively as too many prosecutions. Maybe even moreso.
But speaking of pardons, the only path to something resembling greater unity, the path to everyone kind of taking a deep breath, is a winning D candidate who is willing to pardon the J6ers.

            I can’t see how the regime would want Trump on the ticket.  The regime is not about “we think we can beat him” odds.  The regime is about sure things.  Getting Trump off the ticket means pissing off at least 50% if not more of the GOP’s base.  If it is the GOP itself that removes him, then they can kiss any shot at national office good-bye (to the extent they even had one).  It will take a lot of GOP Congress-critters down too.  Just don’t see how the regime passes up that opportunity.

                Speaking of sure things, or at least lower risk strategies, it seems like the obvious play is to co-opt Trump. Certainly lower risk than doing whatever is necessary to stop him from running. It’s not as if you can’t make a deal with him. Somehow they just can’t bring themselves to. I’m certain some of them believe the most insane TDS type stuff, and that’s part of it. But they can’t all believe that? It seems like I’m still missing some piece of the picture on why they are so categorically opposed to him.

        It’s funny to see those clowns trying to get rid of Trump. Same as 2016.Trump is the man and he will run for office as long as Trump wants to. There is only one option to remove Trump from the ballot and I don’t know that the deep state is confident enough to go there in 2023. It’s too bad that DeSantis is going all in on the presidency. Day 1 in office he will be a repeat of w. Bush – increased Ukraine funding and undying support for our Greatest Ally.Unfortunately, Trump’s legacy will ultimately be sound and fury, signifying nothing.

        In 1996, First Things published its “The End of Democracy: The Judicial Usurpation of Politics,” which caused a tremendous stir at the time for its use of “regime” to describe what was occurring:“Americans are not accustomed to speaking of a regime. Regimes are what other nations have. The American tradition abhors the notion of the rulers and the ruled. We do not live under a government, never mind under a regime; we *are* the government. The traditions of democratic self-governance are powerful in our civics textbooks and in popular consciousness. This symposium asks whether we may be deceiving ourselves and, if we are, what are the implications of that self-deception. By the word ‘regime’ we mean the actual, existing system of government. The question that is the title of this symposium is in no way hyperbolic. The subject before us is the end of democracy.”https://www.firstthings.com/article/1996/11/the-end-of-democracy-introduction

        The people in power want to stay in power. And one way to accomplish this is to make the term “conspiracy theorist” derogatory and then label all dissent as conspiracy nonsense and all believers as kooks. It helps if you own the MSM and social networking platforms, which are then used to shame and deride these kooks and their ideas. And it matters not if this actually works to suppress dissent in individuals. All that matters is the perception that it works, which sows doubts among the untermenschen and keeps them from realizing that they are a majority. When the latter occurs, you get the French Revolution.This kind of mass mind control works quite well as long as people are comfortable in their lives, well fed, fat and generally happy. As long as normie can park his ass on the couch with beer and Cheetos, he will grouse and fart rather than get up and stomp his feet. Which is why the plates must keep spinning, which is enabled by foreigners continuing to buy US Treasuries, which is going to end when Ukraine loses.And all of this is a good thing because it brings about the curing collapse sooner rather than later. Vote harder if you must in order to maintain your sanity, but spare some effort to stock the larder with a few more #10 cans just in case.

            Tom, you’ve repeatedly referred to larder stocking in the past.  No disagreement here.  However, does this belie a belief in the system—as in recovery?  Seems all these plans to remain independent are finite in length and eventually depend on a reformation of order before these measures run out.  Few folks can live off the grid.

                Given it is the start of summer, it is easy to miss but cold weather will begin in Europe in four months (earlier in the northern extremes). If the war is winding down this year, it should be then. The warmer than normal last winter is unlikely to be repeated. Macron is making noise about it already.As for the political aspects, it is impossible to see how any debate whatsoever will be allowed if the war drags into next year. We have to see the deplatforming of Trump along with the war as a piece. RFKJr. will be silenced as well if the war drags on.

                    And who, exactly, is Macron, and why is he tugging on the sleeve of BRIC(S) for an invite to push his line?  Certainly not for the benefit of France (it is to laugh, mon ami), as everyone knows his lack of interest dor the well-being of La Belle France.
Read this post by Andrei Martyanov which, in my estimation, provides a more accurate take on for (((whose interests))) he truly advocates.

                        Probably just hedging his bets.  Of course you’re right he doesn’t give a flip about France (or more accurately, the average Frenchman).  But he does know that his fortunes are tied to at least not the total destruction of France.  If things go too sideways, he could get the French style royal treatment.   At the least, take a significant cut in his standard of living/international standing.  Being the clever weasel that he is (learned from his masters), he will play both (and all ) sides.

                Its not about living off the grid, but rather surviving the interregnum (which is impossible to predict in terms of duration – too many variables). But a single #10 can of refried beans can feed you for a month if you include a sack of hard tack with it. No, its not ideal, but almost no one in our current population has ever experienced real hunger in their lives and it’s a game changer when it happens. People will do pretty crazy things when they’ve gone 3 days without a meal. It’s not well known here, but when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, tens of millions of Russians were left near starvation for years and many died as a result (particularly the elderly). Yes, this can happen her too.

        On almost a daily basis, I’m reminded of when, in the summer of 2018 a radio news segment about the Russian hoax had a sound bite from some “expert” predicting that Trump would be allowed to avoid certain imprisonment by resigning the presidency. It’s been Deja Vu ever since.

        I believe in the Smorgasbord theory. There are conspirators and there are the eager narrative parrots. Some are both. For example, some of these DAs and attorneys believe the narrative they’ve had to believe their entire lives, (I be down here cause slavery and whitey), because it assuages their fear of failure and is the key to their non-meritorious acquisition of power. Then, they get this opportunity and if they have half a brain they realize they can get a payout by playing ball and serving the conspirator’s narratives.Speaking of narratives, I worked for a company where the CEO truly believed every narrative. He was the class Gen X, “entrepreneur.” Got some cheap money in the early oughts and, “exited”, well. (Exited means: sell a dog shit company to a much larger company for way more than it is worth, if it is worth anything at all) Post exit, he is a genius and surrounded by more people who want to throw money at his next idea. Now he can form a company and change capitalism. This company is going to make billions and create a kinder, fairer capitalism. No more exploitation and injustice in his capitalism.We heard this communist spout off this claptrap all the time. If you read his emails and heard his talks, you would think he was the VP of HR. I want our office to look like insert name of  very vibrant city. (meaning: I want less white people in here). We need more women in engineering. Invite sad sack feminists in to fill us with gamergate sob stories, and have the HR consultant bend the knee in subservience and deference to a woman as an example to all the men how to be an ally. (that really happened). On topic here, this dolt of a CEO one day during the big gotcha moment of Russia Russia Russia he said something like, “Today we are going to finally get that crooked son of a bitch”, his voice full of anger and sanctimonious pride.I think there were three of us who understood the implications of all of the communistic, anti-white, anti-male, “diversity”, blathering and prattling and actual hiring policies that guy introduced to a once dynamic and rocketing company. It floundered badly by the way. There were three of us that I know of who seethed with a hatred for that man and his opportunistic HR harpies. That is because we understood the implications of his ideas. Sadly, hundreds of people went right along with it – with glee.He was a true believer. Everyone else was a cloud person or a former dirt person desperate to remove all traces of dirt from their appearance. There weren’t enough of us who are mentally healthy enough to be filled with hatred for that man and those people to do the right and healthy thing with that hatred. Maybe someday there will be enough people who can think beyond the next luxury vacation, the next foodie self indulgence and burning man sojourn or psychedelic experiment to be filled with a proper and healthy level of hatred, and the resolve to do the proper and healthy thing with it.I am reminded of the old Romans. What an amazing culture. I think about the origins of the term, decimation. Any unit that had even one man who fled the battle field would be captured and gathered up. The men would draw straws to see who would be clubbed to death and who would do the clubbing. I think these traitors to our folk, to our nation, to our posterity, to the sacrifices of the ingenius and daring explorers and builders of this nation ought to draw lots and decimate each other. I don’t think the survivors who wield the clubs against their fellow turncoats deserve our mercy. I am all ears for what to do with that lot of human detritus when the decimation game is over.

            Some time within the last six months or so, I stumbled upon a story about a new stock fund which specialized in SHORTING the stocks of poorly managed companies.It was created by some young whipper-snapper types, who were deploying/employing/paying/bribing spies in various companies in order to get dirt on managerial incompetence and fancifully nonsensical bidness models.Unfortunately, in 2023, trying to search on generic market fund keywords to find any specific fund is an exercise in futility; all you get are hundreds upon hundreds of pages of paid marketeering nonsense, so I will likely never hear of those guys again.But whoever they were, they sure did have the right attitude, and at the time the article was written, their bidness’s value was heading towards the stratosphere.

                The only problem there is that it doesn’t account for the government or other powerful entities shoveling money to prop the failing companies up. Or in some cases, outright legislating their competitors out of business.We all remember “too big to fail”, and while that was one of the most egregious cases, it was hardly unique. There are many companies today that would be worthless if it wasn’t for secret (and not so secret) state backing.

            Having a repeat of 2020 election night (with the mysterious pause at 9pm, the delayed mail-ins) would further erode confidence among the great swath of the non-political and what normie “vote harder” conservatives remain. Maybe, just maybe, normal people start tuning out of democratic theater.Every regime needs the illusion of popular consent. So my prediction is there will be shenanigans in the other direction: 2024 will be made to feel smooth. There won’t be the chaos of 2020. TPTB will make sure the counting looks legit, and a winner will be called promptly in the late evening. The press will celebrate how efficient and wonderful American democracy is. Smooth transfer of power and all that.Maybe Team Red wins, or Team Blue. It doesn’t matter. What matters is the ballots are counted and a winner is declared that evening. No media firestorms. That may be good for (((ratings))) but bad for the Regime.

                    True, assuming the Regime cares about the feelings of  of the MAGA crowd. That’s a big assumption. If they were actually smart, they’d divert the MAGA energy into DeSantis (or a yet unknown candidate who can pretend to be populist), let DeSantis win, and then let the normiecons grill again.

                Interesting supposition.  However, I think it assumes too much sanity of part of the Left.  They have, for all intent and purposes, won the process.  Why allow it to work against them?  Certainly from what I see here in my State, no meaningful election reform has been permitted to pass.  No sure I see any different in other States with large “blue” voting populations.No, I suspect they (Leftists) will certainly improve their election fortification process, but never allow elections to work against their interests, which of course is *power*.  No sure TPTB prefer this, but are they able to rein in their radical arm.

Correct. The question you implied–how much does the Regime control the Left?–is a key one. It can turn Antifa, BLM and its other terror organizations on and off, and manipulate Karen, but the rest? I dunno.

                Sundance over at the Conservative Tree House has already pointed out the choreography for such a “normalized” election becoming visible. He made note that DeSantis is calling out Newsom for not committing to a presidental run. In other words, “Come on in, the water’s fine, the UniParty has both of our backs. If you play ball with TPTB you might win, or if not, your future will be assured in some fashion, and maybe in a better way than being their front man”.

        Of course, it is not helped by the fact that the president is a doddering old fool who barely knows where he is most of the time.
It is also not helped by the fact the conspiracy theories turn out to be more accurate than what the regime peddles.

        Yeah, I disagree. Here’s my Alex Jones take:A modus vivendi has been reached in that both Joe Biden, who was a throw down president as it was, and Donald Trump are both to be ushered off the stage. The absence of Trump will lead to catastrophic Republican losses up and down the ticket, but that’s the price of doing business. A third person, possibly someone either endorsed by Trump or Trump himself, gets on the ballot in key Republican states. This is the fly in the ointment and where the real battle will be fought–preventing a third guy’s ballot access. He’ll still get on the ballot and this could throw the election into the House. It’s the one thing that fortification cannot get around. Kennedy may enter as a third party candidate as well and get on the ballot in a few states. That’s a bit less likely and the Trump or Trump clone third party run is far more likely if not probable.Biden is simple. His meds will be withheld, and the public deterioration rather than the bribery scandal will render him unable to run in the general. Harris will announce her support of Gavin Newsome and campaign for him, and I do agree he will appoint her to the Senate.As to the burgeoning bribe scandal, I think this is an intra-Regime battle, with the FBI as big of a target as Biden himself due to their role in sitting on the evidence. Maybe the other intelligence agencies are at odds with the Bureau? I don’t think the FBI is knifing Biden and the FBI is being knifed right along with him.As an aside, the 2016 election will mark the last time the Republican Party was a viable and that due to someone not very Republican.We’ve seen this movie before and the fallout led a little dust-up that started in South Carolina.UFO’s (nice and appropriate intro music), Masonic temples, and fluoride in the water somehow are involved, too.

            As we saw in 2020, Biden doesn’t need to campaign. The media will do that for him. His deterioration is probably irrelevant. I can come up with no reason for Harris to accept a demotion as long as she is VP.
But I am sure they have planned this out. Somehow. Kind of like how they planned out the big Ukie counteroffensive.

            It will and they will. Quite a few of the GOP “leaders” are stupid enough to think otherwise, too. 2016 was the last time the Republican Party was nationally viable as it is, and the impotence will spread to the states after this stunt.
It is indeed a good thing.

            If Vichy doesn’t do it, I can almost guarantee that Democrat controlled states will not allow Trump to be on the ballot in their states to save Our Democracy. He’s a criminal, and an insurrectionist and aagent of the Bad Russian Man. Vichy will, gleefully, agree. And collect their 30 pieces of silver.

        The Bad Orange Indictments are a loyalty test for the Vichy Right, as well as Florida Man. It really could turn into the election of 1860, if the Bad Orange Man decides to quit being a CivNat and get capital S Serious and run even if he’s under indictment, even if the Republican Party kicks him out. President Pudding Pop is increasingly the 21st century’s James Buchanan, and if the Bad Orange Man and Florida Man are running, that could signal the Night of the Long Knives within the Democratic Party to replace him.It could be the two parties split into three or four factions, very quickly. The only thing missing is the John Brown Moment, which I have predicted for years.

        In my experience, most people using the term “deep state” aren’t using it to mean a secret cabal underneath a volcanic island. The most popular general meaning seems to be more or less what for decades was referred to as the military-industrial complex, as well as the vast unelected bureaucracy. Of course as we all know, in 2016 the military-industrial complex was revealed to be nothing more than an extreme right-wing conspiracy theory.

            The term originated with the Ottomans and referenced the caliphate’s permanent bureacracy that remained intact regardless of the sultan. It is a very apt term for what is the situation in the United States. Some prefer “administrative state” because it sounds less conspiratorial, but “Deep State” has a long history and I like it.

            Far as I know the first US president to publicly utter the phrase deep state was Bill Clinton and nobody seemed to have a big problem with it when he did. If memory serves, it was accepted, at the time, that he had a point. Of course Ike talked about the same thing in different terms much earlier. Anyhow, a mere one generation after Clinton, it’s a “conspiracy theory.”

                Clinton once said his mentor was Carroll Quigley, the great American conspiracy theorist/braggart.
The deep state loved his flattery and paid him to deliver it personally. The American military idée fixe that “diversity” is its highest value comes directly from him—probably the most significant civilian military consultant—not from German communists or French deconstructionists.
Quigley also pioneered The Chomsky (for continentals, The Derrida): calling everyone outside the establishment who cites your work Nazis. His writing isn’t digestible by the untutored reader, see. It’s for the generals and whoever follows them.
Straussian!

                It is interesting. I was reading some TGR things the other day. One was a speech Clinton gave, I believe at that Portland college of ferals that kicked out the rabidly leftist Weinstein guy.It was remarkable how Clinton harped on the importance of the Constitution. It was filled with his authoritarian bent that immigration was a done deal … What was interesting was how much he stressed that the immigrants would need to become Americans and understand our system of government and learn about our history … …Other than the, “there will be mass immigration and you will be forced to accept it”, angle it was remarkable in its seemingly sincere need to make them American and respect our system and history.Maybe the Obama faction torpedoed that. I know David Rubenstein and the neo-cons have deliberately. Rubenstein is probably who Obama has colluded with to marry the University Black Supremacist (burn it all down) with the Rubenstein erase and rewrite Historic America approach.In any case, letting in this many immigrants and telling them to hate America and hate white people, is throwing firecrackers into a barn full of explosives.
