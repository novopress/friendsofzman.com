        If you can get half a dozen or more like-minded individuals together who are able to pool some cash, rent out an inexpensive storefront in a cheaper part of town and turn it into an ‚Äúart gallery‚Äù. (With all the legitimate paperwork etc). Since just about anything now can be considered ‚Äúart,‚Äù you can hang anything you like on the walls and call it art and nobody can gainsay you.  Just don‚Äôt hang anything controversial: your gallery is NOT ‚Äúthe crazy WN gallery‚Äù it is just a blas√© anodyne place with a banana duct-taped the wall or something.Start an underground club using the gallery as a base or off-hours clubhouse (the gallery is only open Wed.-Sat. 3-5 pm or ‚Äúby appointment‚Äù), collect dues from the members and use the dues to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù the ‚Äúart‚Äù every month, so the place stays afloat.  Keep it all very proper and legal and above-board, however that works.Of course if some of your wine and cheese gallery ‚Äúopenings‚Äù and ‚Äúprivate events‚Äù just happen to be full of lively political discussion of a certain bent, or if you publish DIY chapbooks full of essays and reprints of certain well-written short blog essays, well that‚Äôs just part of a lively cultural scene.

            I like your thinking!
Or a men‚Äôs club.  Lots of harrumphing. Men need that. Or something like the Masons without the weirdness.  A little secrecy to pique interest.  Invitation only. Somewhere you can speak freely. Fight Club without the fighting. I‚Äôve had these discussions with drinking buddies.

                We‚Äôre doing a little get together later this week.  One of my agenda items is how to gradually bring in others.  Half probably would qualify as DR, the others more mainstream.  But we mostly have to stay deep cover simply because of our jobs (couple of ex SC clerk law partners in there for example).  It‚Äôs pick and spade work.

                    Sam:Pick and spade work indeed. It is amazing that the country I used to live in is gone and the Orwellian overlords reduce grown men to have to be so careful simply in having face to face conversations.
I can‚Äôt imagine how tough it is for people who have young children and fear losing their job for performing such a revolutionary act as engaging in free speech.
What a country, huh.

                I‚Äôve actually been in far-right men‚Äôs clubs in the Large Northeastern Metropolis (TM) where I live. Lots of harrumphing. Going there gives me a very refreshing sense of safety. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot of CivNats there, but I‚Äôve actually had discussions with various members about our Demographic Age, and they don‚Äôt like it at all. Planting seeds.

                Spread around to existing organizations‚Ä¶ i.e. Highland Games, Hibernians, Am Legion, or Emerald Society. You won‚Äôt see a great slew if diversitah at those. Though I did see a black tranny bag piper (insert joke here) at a Highland Games once.
Yes I know some of these are Irish organizations and a grip of folks here have a beef with the Irish. Never been one for purity vortex spinouts but they‚Äôre white now. üòÅ

                    The civic angle is a definite plus. Get involved in the community. Be admirable, like Z said.
Sportsman‚Äôs clubs are great for that too, at least where I‚Äôm at.

                        That comes from a site that I think was called Stuff White People Like. They had a gag primer for black folks on getting along with whites.
It went something like,
White people like St. Paddy‚Äôs day and are cool with letting you tag along and will even buy you beer and shots. Eventually they will begin to tell you about how their Irish ancestors were once enslaved and discriminated against here in America.  If you want the white/Irish people to keep buying you drinks DO NOT SAY ‚ÄúYeah, but you‚Äôre white now.‚Äù

I was most certainly NOT trying to be hurtful. I was referring to my post.
A co-worker was reading the gag over his shoulder and a bit about white people faking soccer enthusiasm.
I think that was the site. I haven‚Äôt actually seen it myself so I couldn‚Äôt be specific enough as to what windowless panel van they were driving nor point out on the doll where exactly it touched me. üòÅ

                Another version of Z‚Äôs idea would be to identify obscure races for offices nobody votes for, run a respectable-looking, likeable person as a DR candidate with no real expectations of actually winning, and use the campaign as a pretext for networking and organizing, forming structures to be put to good use later.One practice that Jews have which is extremely useful and practical, something the DR should imitate, is this: they form seventy-bazillion tax-exempt non-profit organizations, all fueled from small donations.  These places are not the big heavy hitters like ADL, they are little things like the National Council of Jewish Stamp Collectors and what-not.  The purpose of the org is, it has a great letterhead and a nice website, sounds important, runs a small office with a few interns and a small paid staff and a bunch of older volunteers.  It provides useful summer-job experience for high school and college kids, looks impressive on a resume (the World Jewish Forum of Letterheads is always going to look impressive).  There‚Äôs enough money in the budget to give an entry-level job to a few college grads too dim to get into law school, gives them important networking and organizational skills, and a leg up ‚Äî their first job right out of third-tier college was something better than Starbucks.DR needs to start funding things like that, orgs with impressive names that can run on a small budget, in order to seed experience in the younger folks.

                    I‚Äôm not sure this is the best idea. Way back in my semi-younger days, I was very active in the beginnings of the California Green Party (I know, I know‚Ä¶). They would do this very thing, but not so much with the obscure races. They‚Äôd run people who weren‚Äôt remotely qualified or interesting, just to get their party name on the ballot. What it did was make them look like a joke. Ok, more of a joke than they actually were. Overall, it hurt them and reduced their credibility with the people they were trying to win over.Regardless of the race we run people for, we need to always make sure they are qualified and interested in holding the position, should they actually win.

            Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of good art. My wife ran an art museum for a while and I was always impressed at the quality of really good art out there. I‚Äôm not referring to college students who have a couple semesters under their belts and throw a bunch of ‚Äúmixed media‚Äù around and call it art. Rather, it‚Äôs the older people who spend their entire lives learning their craft and doing real work that you want‚ÄìREALLY WANT‚Äìto have in your home.One of the horrible things the left has done in their march through our culture, is destroy our perception of creativity and art. We are expected to think that graffiti, urine, and juvenile splatters created by kids is ‚Äúart‚Äù. We are supposed to applaud obnoxious noise and ‚Äúbeats‚Äù as music. Fuck that shit. Real art takes discipline, study and mastery of a craft.Just as we support the thinkers and doers on our side, don‚Äôt forget to support the artists. Part of reclaiming our culture is reclaiming our sense of beauty and creativity.

                I have a BFA (long story). Showed my work a few times, sold a little. Didn‚Äôt want the MFA debt. Got disillusioned with the art world because it seemed you get ahead by gutting beauty and culture. But you‚Äôre right. It might be time to put my skills to good use. Thanks for that!

                    I encourage you to discover your art again.  In the last two years I have done this and it is nourishing (and difficult).

                    Painter, light it up!I went through something similar. Gave up my art for years.Then, after cutting loose from the progressive aspirational life I took it up again.I am not that good. But I know what is beautiful and that what moves me likely moves others ‚Äì and that fact is no accident. There is communion in what we create.The art markets are totally pozzed ‚Äì but worshipping ugliness cannot hold; beauty wins out.Let the nihilists and suicidal progs consume the degeneracy smeared on canvas.Real people, our people, are starved for the beauty of the human experience reflected in our creations.The pozz market is fleeting virtue sognaling. Actual art is eternal.I know wealthy progs into art. They go to openings and blather on about the black tranny finger painting its trauma. The may even buy it. For conversations with their lessers.But when it comes to their mountain homes and studies where they actually live, they have beautiful paintings and sculptures of landscapes and icons of visceral life in the west.Creativity is a divine gift. Don‚Äôt hide your light behind the bushel of pozz.Our side may not curate the galleries, but we know truth and beauty when we see it.

                        Screwtape and Line,
Well said‚Ä¶ As personal advice to others and on a larger scale for our movement. Thank you both for broaching the subject.
Art and beauty is needed desperately for Our People.
I dont think dissidents can personally underestimate the power of defining space in their lives for art. It can be a balm to the frustration, anger and worry that accompanies dissident politics. Carving out time for good music, visiting art museums, or personal creations (even if it is craft or artisanal pursuits) help armor the soul and remind us why we fight for our ancestors.

                            When my big woke corporate work home, years ago, dictated cheap art prints in fancy frames for all employee offices, I jumped all over the two available Bierstadt prints.  Woodpile Report stuff.  They don‚Äôt do the original art any justice, but I have kept the prints through multiple office moves, and they never fail to elicit comments and conversation when people are in there for the first time.

                                I have to admit, Woodpile engendered an appreciation in the natralist paintings for me. I‚Äôve always enjoyed the bucolic works (probably because my Sainted Mother loves them). I just had to stop looking at the nature paintings in terms of exact replication of the terrain and also quit looking for the ambush and tactical advantage points in the scenes.

            Living in Virginia last year I noticed many small towns had a Ruritan Club. Most seemed very active. Quite a few announced concealed carry classes, and women‚Äôs firearms training, on their signs. These places were tucked in throughout the remote areas of the state, and looked well kept up.  We should likely consider joining this type organization were they exist ‚Ä¶. already established infrastructure and often like-minded membership.

                Primi, I‚Äôve seen Ruritans all over VA, too.I never thought to ask.
I wonder how many similar, old-line associations of that type there are‚Ä¶?
Side thought: how many antiques barns back east give demos of how to use the old hand tools?  Or have clubs that do?

            Bookshops, ‚Äúprivate libraries,‚Äù museums, even bars or coffee shops and anything else where people sit around and have conversations also work.

                            One further thought, the System has developed an alternate virtual economy of government feeding government.
If we are to survive, we must be able to feed, build, heal, and nurture our own.
The Real, while they focus on predatory pacification.  A secret rebellion, like the 300 year war of the Han against their Manchu overlords.

                        Alzaebo, so many lost skills and knowledge! Thats a good idea.I have been getting into foraging and herbalism over the last several years. Been making some rudimentary elixirs and such from plants I grow in my garden. So much to learn.Recovering from surgery over the past few months I have been doing a lot of reading. Read ‚ÄúOne Second After‚Äù and then the sequel ‚ÄúOne Year After‚Äù.Apocalyptic suspense/adventure has been a big genre lately, but I found those books to be a pretty good fiction of what might play out. Its chilling . Really gets the wheels turning.The starvation and lack of medicine is one thing, but what kept gnawing at me was how essential family and real community become when the lights go out. And how I am largely on my own.Having resources to survive is one thing, defending a perimeter 24/7 from 50,000 ‚Äòrefugees‚Äô from fallen cities and violent roving gangs is something else entirely.The scenario is terrible to ponder but is also appealing in its sudden obsolescence of all the noise and ‚Äòtech‚Äô and social garbage.Of course in our daydreams we all assume we survive lol. I think thats why those post-apocalyptic stories are so popular these days. Modernity is not quite the path to Utopia we are told.Reminds me I need to get to the dentist before the lights go out. Died from a toothache is a real thing.

        ‚ÄúPaying NetFlix every month may ease the pain of your demise, but giving that money to dissidents may save your kind.‚Äù
This is an excellent point and if you totaled up all the subscriptions to the pozzed out stuff like this including your cable subscription you can take that money and donate it monthly to someone that doesn‚Äôt hate you. All these devices are just propaganda machines but you can take control of what you expose yourself to. Even z-man is a form of propaganda but I‚Äôve chosen to embrace it

            Never financially support people who hate you.  I got rid of my cable for non-ideological reasons, but I never got it again for ideological reason.  I cancelled Netflix the day I saw the trailer for Dear White People.  Not only is paying them  financing the enemy, even worse, is getting the POZ into your and your children‚Äôs brains watching the crap.  Sadly, this stuff goes way back further than most people realize.  I was recently watching some 1930s hour long movies based on a serial call Mr Wong.  The white chief of police is a babbling moron while Mr Wong, who solves the cases is the wise, cultured Chinese guy with the Oxford education.  Today it‚Äôs not nearly as in your face and it is more widespread.  Pretty much every TV show I manage to catch in some way is loaded with propaganda.

                Tars, indeed.  I remember‚Äîand more importantly, my son remembers‚Äîour drive to his school one day and our discussion of the money Jack Nicholson was making with his role in the original Batman ($50M and growing).  My goal in these discussions was always to get him to ‚Äúrun the numbers‚Äù mentally‚Äîan easy way to tell when the latest news story was pure bullshit, as most are.With the info from the news account on the radio, we estimated that good old Jack was getting about $2-3 or so from every ticket sale to the movie (at that time).  So I put the question to my son, ‚ÄúWould you give Jack Nicholson $3 if you met him on the street?‚Äù (This question asked in light of his Leftist political stances.). Of course, the answer was ‚Äúno‚Äù.  So my response was, ‚ÄúWell, consider that next time before you buy a ticket to his latest movie‚Äîyou are using your own money against your interest.‚Äù

            Watching almost any TV show from the 1970s, 80s, or even 90s is a tremendous eye-opener. Most of them would never be permitted today because of how politically incorrect (i.e., realistic) they are. Jokes in the sitcoms offend all the protected groups. The day is not far off when these shows will be taken off streaming media because of hurty feelings.

            Meme ‚Äì the most important thing about optics is getting the message across that we‚Äôre not a single movement that can be tarred with one brush.  I don‚Äôt have to worry as much about punching Right if people understand the difference between supporting common goals and supporting everything that comes out of every DR‚Äôs mouth.If you worry too much over optics you feed the idea that we have something to hide or be ashamed of.

        Already in the process of picking a roster of 2020 candidates to support, though emphasizing those that can take back districts lost in 2018.  Know this doesn‚Äôt meet the ideological purity test, but there is just as much utility in removing the left center portion of the Democrats‚Äìand leaving the party in the hands of the Tide Pod Evita wing.  I also have to be careful about getting on searchable databases.  We‚Äôve already got nutters using databases to search up Trump contributors around here.

                Acceleration is under-appreciated due to many things, residual patriotism among them.
What‚Äôs best for ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù is no longer what‚Äôs best for Us, and it hasn‚Äôt been for a long time.  I know there‚Äôs a spectrum of dissidence around here but I think being ‚Äúpost-American‚Äù is a good defining line.
We‚Äôre almost universally united in looking for a better, different future and moving past the idea that the USA as a 50-state CivNat multicultural union is either worthy or capable of preservation or restoration.

What Townhall thinks of as ‚ÄúAmerica.‚Äù  It‚Äôs a shallow fake vision of capitalism as a moral force and the whole Onward Judeo-Christian Soldiers mythology that‚Äôs been used to justify the unnecessary horror of total war since the Civil War.

                    A lot of the problem with all Leftist revolutions, whether the kind they had in Russia or China or the slower moving cultural revolution of the last 50 years here is that they target the most productive people in society as objects of derision and destruction. This makes sense from the point of view of the *mechanics* of revolution. If you are a cynical elitist who craves power but are not currently IN power, any society has a ready-made rabble formed from the left side of the Bell Curve types. Spandrell goes into great detail about this ‚Äìhttp://spandrell.com/2017/11/14/biological-leninism/This is also why many smart people who should be reacting with alarm go along at first saying ‚Äúsee, it‚Äôs working out OK‚Äù. That‚Äôs because a smart radical movement keeps things much the same at first, allowing most people to live peaceful and prosperous lives even if they are among the ‚ÄúKulak‚Äù class. This is also easy to do since the rabble isn‚Äôt smart enough to notice that the revolution is all rhetoric and no follow-through. Of course this is what the Maoists and Stalinists couldn‚Äôt do. They started killing people too soon. Our Left, which was (re-)born in the 1960s hasn‚Äôt made that mistake so far.Eventually though, the older smart people retire or die and the younger smart people get wise to the scam and start taking measures to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù the system in various ways. Our society also has the unique problem of the demographic shift, which basically means that the younger generations are somewhat smaller and a lot dumber. The number of people who can do useful things declines and the growing rabble demands more than symbolic control over things. This is why Biden and Pelosi are being replaced by idiots like AOC and that woman with the bathrobe on her head.For these reasons I tend to think that the ‚Äú50-state CivNat multicultural union‚Äù, if it ever existed, actually had a heart attack and died on its feet about 50 years ago. It‚Äôs just that giants take a while to hit the floor.Anyway, thanks for posting and getting me thinking about this stuff Exile. I always enjoy your stuff and your travels add an international dimension that is often overlooked. American whites MUST find a way to team up with our friends across the sea more.Happy New Year to you all!

                The problem with this trick is that when lunatic left grab the power, you may not get back it very soon. In the Russia wise people let Lenin to power for be clowning himself. But later wise people cold not get rid from him anymore.

                    Juri, as things stand in the West there‚Äôs nothing stopping that from happening now.  No establishment-recognized opposition force would stand in the way of totalitarian measures being used against BadThinkers. ‚Äì see Con, Inc. or the neoliberal defenders of ‚Äúdemocracy.‚Äù
The only thing we can end up with through acceleration is a more honest, overt tyranny rather than the velvet glove, stab-in-the-back variety we already have.

        First, common ground. Everyone hopes that catastrophe can be avoided by a grassroots rebirth of commonsense and peaceful change leading to amicable solutions to the many problems that currently afflict us. Awakening ‚Äúothers‚Äù and building communities of common interest is ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù social medicine and the option of first resort. BUT, if that doesn‚Äôt work in time, there needs to be a Plan B. Survival is the imperative, not feelgood glad-handing in coffee klatches. Some of us need to work on that problem too.

                Agreed. My haven is a high mountain valley in the Central Rockies. Plenty of buffer between me and the nearest cesspool of urban chaos. But isolation is mitigation, not solution.

        The last point is especially important to my situation. None of the following is an original idea of mine but I want to repeat details here. Try to be a visible model ‚Äì well dressed and groomed, well spoken, in reasonable physical condition, not being an obnoxious a-hole out in public or on the road. Show up for work everyday ready to work and work at the highest possible level. Silently and carefully compete against the non-European types and silently band together with your fellow European types (this has to be done intelligently as a defensive measure against the maniacal SJW types.) Stop being lazy and forking money to 3rd world laborers ‚Äì mow your own lawn, fix your own plumbing, wash your own car, do as many hands-on fix-it yourself tasking as possible, stop throwing money at Taco Bell, McDonalds and Starbucks who employee 3rd world immigrants and cop-disrespecting low life. God please stop watching monkey ball.Conversations with family, friends and co-workers can be delicate. Most white people are not ready for our political vision. My political take to them is that of self-discipline, self-reliance, self-responsibility, self-accountability and hard work as a means and an end to maintaining self-respect in a world gone mad with trans-sexualism, reparations and the unending victimhood mentality.

            Also, if you really must have someone else mow your lawn for you, take notice of the crews that work your neighborhood; if any of them avoid hiring lots of brown people, think about hiring them. Better yet, find that local kid who is trying to earn some honest money.

            Started changing my own oil after I was ‚Äúserved‚Äù by an all Arab oil change place. Now I do most of my small repairs. Big repairs are done at a family owned shop where all the staff are white.Stopped eating out at fast food after the crews had been switched to ugly Indians with ugly beards. Do almost all my own cooking now and am health conscious. Fast food gives me the shits now, it really is a poison.So many little things you can do. And yes, quietly connect on a deep level with other europeans, even if they aren‚Äôt on our side (as long as they aren‚Äôt fanatical anti whites). Youd be amazed how eager they are for a deep connection with racial kin; they might not even realize it.

            2A, great points. On aesthetics, I am a big proponent of dressing the part.Where I live the casual sad-sack perpetual 12yo snowboarder look is rampant. Between the soymales and the outdoorsy hoodie types, rare is a man dressed in masculine functional well-kept western wear.Just so happens thats what I wear almost exclusively. People notice. Always positive feedback. And I back it up with my language and demeanor.I suffer no fools and reward those who present well with a reciprocal level of respect. I ignore ugliness and slovenly people and very thinly veil my disappointment in them.Our thing has manifold opportunities to separate from the fray of homogenized globohomo.This is an area I press on with male friends. We will conjure our community out of our own actions. nobody is coming to the rescue.

        Actual involvement and all forms of contributions indeed are needed. I especially like how you phrased it here: ‚Äú(b)y setting a high standard in your personal life and being a respectable face to skeptical people about these issues, you become one of those many on-ramps to our thing.‚Äù How we conduct ourselves and appear to those almost ready to take the first step are of paramount importance. It‚Äôs why AmRen‚Äôs insistence on coats and ties at its gatherings is more than affectation.This actually has been a very good year for the movement. Intentional or not, Trump‚Äôs exposure of the  Deep State has awakened millions of people to how utterly corrupt our system is. So has the impeachment, which is a blatant Jewish project; the grotesque and disturbing Semitic visages of the key players has caught the attention of the types previously ready to put freaking Israeli flags in their yards.The events unfolding in Virginia to disarm the populace will radicalize millions more and present an opportunity to strike back at the corrupt oppressors. That will be a gift that keeps on giving and there will be a huge influx of foot soldiers into Virginia ready to assist in any and all ways. 2020 will be a key year for us. Battle lines have been drawn and are being drawn, and now it will not be a kamikaze mission to respond in all ways, which was not previously possible.

        Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri might qualify for the list?I am hoping Tucker Carlson takes a step into politics and gets traction with the normies as we go forward.I was at a conference with Carlson in which he hinted at a future political career. Carlson also said at that conference that he expected to eventually get booted from Fox. He also said Trump was too close to Goldman Saks and would not take us where we needed to go.In my mind Tucker or Kobach is the next step.Someone normies can be comfortable with.They ain‚Äôt us but they lean toward us.

            Hawley?  Some concerns:First, he has a Stanford undergrad, Yale law, and judicial clerkship pedigree.  That background is great for the ruling class, in general, and the academy, the judiciary, the government / media complex, and the deep state, in particular.Second, he has waffled some on the 2A.   He supports strengthening background checks.  He supported the banning of bump stocks. He has also sent mixed signals on red-flag laws.Third, he voted to prevent the President from lifting sanctions against a number of Russian companies.Fourth, he admires the progressive gas-bag, cheerleader for empire, mass-murdering Teddy Roosevelt.Fifth, he supported the U.S. Embassy‚Äôs move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.Sixth, he opposes BDS.Seventh, he supports the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act.Yeah, with ((( friends ))) like this, who needs enemies.

                The Senator Hawley replaced was Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill whom was not looney enough to help us drive normal folk our way but still bad enough to harm us.Hawley was a step up from Claire and the noise that he has made in hearings against big tech and censorship is at least some noise that might help us.Hawley is also a step up from the other Missouri Senator RINO Senator Roy Blunt.A step up is a small win and Hawley is a step our way even if he has ties to the usual suspects foreign lobby.Who doesn‚Äôt in DC at this point in history?Until we get wealthy elites willing to step up and finance our politicians we will be at a disadvantage for getting the type of politicians we desire.

        Great essay as usual Z.It‚Äôs pathetic that there are so few politicians running that amount to much but it is what it is. I knew of the other 3 but had never heard of Foxworth.I checked out his site and the answer he gave for running was basically ‚Äúwhat am I going to tell my boys about why their country is like it is and concluded with this answer.‚ÄúThe only answer that I can truthfully give them is that this happened because they live in a nation of cowards, and their father is one of them. Since I cannot bear to tell my sons this truth, I have decided to do something about it. I pray that you will join me.‚ÄùAbsolutely chilling.  So if not us; who? And if not now, when?I will be in New Orleans next month and if I can I plan to stop by his headquarters. It will be nice to see and talk to actual humans. And, of course, I plan to bring x number of $20 bills to donate to the cause.

        I‚Äôve always agreed with that position Z-man and hope others will see the light there as well.  The last politician here that I had the most alignment with got his head handed to him after one term in office.  How am I or the ‚Äúcause‚Äù better off with him out and a Lefty in?  No, I‚Äôd have been better off with him a bit less in your face and at least punching in the right direction.  But I do recognize and respect those ‚Äúaccelerationists‚Äù out there in the group.

        Well, I used to be an Episcoal priest and before that a low level legal official and before that a university instructor and before that Navy enlisted serving NSA. After facing up to the facts that the Church had changed into something else in my diocese,and that I was unemployable due to traditional positions on marriage and sexuality, I started over as a laborer back home in my hometown.My loyalty is first to family and Church and then to my people.  I will be volunteering for one of the candidates Z listed above and I am always on the lookout for a good volunteer opportunity in my community. I like to get my hands dirty, but I‚Äôm done with the nasty business in progressive dominated organizations  I hope to meet some folks with like views. I‚Äôd be happy to wear a Z lapel pin. God bless you Zman and all you other good people

            Penny for your thoughts, given your background. Have multiple young ones and despite not having personally been raised religious, have recently begun attending local Episcopal church in accordance with family background. It is pretty liberal and so is priest, though to her credit she mostly seems to try to remain neutral-ish. Is this a waste of my family‚Äôs time and money?

                PvtPls,  I encourage you to attend with your family. To regularly worship reminds you and your wife and children that there is an ultimate, timeless  reality that is above and beyond this experience. I hope it is for you a time and place to experience the true, the good, and the beautiful.  Also, a space to experience community and serve God and other peopleI really wish the Episcopal Church were not in the shape it is in and I left much I love and many friends behind. The conflict between progressives and traditionalists was even less black and white than I thought a decade or so ago:  some of those progressives are kind and fair minded people and some of the traditionalists turned out to be self-serving assholes.So, go there. Make sure there is a good Sunday School for the kids. Appreciate the Book of Common Prayer‚Äì  it‚Äôs a treasure.  Pay attention to the youth program and be prepared to be proactive and put your kids in a conservative evangelical congregation‚Äôs program or a Catholic youth program.God bless

        Z-man, you have asked for $5 a month which is $60 a year. My problem is that for several reasons I must just send cash. There will be no way for you to tell it is me other than the two fifties in a card. Sending late this week.
More importantly, I offer my prayers for your work.

            Mark:I have the same issue.With what is coming for us I will only:1. Send denominations of $5, $10, or $20 in cash.2. Literally use rubber gloves to touch the cash and the envelope.3. Use a sponge to dampen the envelope.  DNA lasts a long time so do NOT lick.4. Keep several of these envelopes in my car so that when I am away from home which I am a fair amount I can mail it from a post office away from home so at least it is not always coming from the same Post Office stamp which would indicate where I live within a few miles.5. Put different fake return addresses on the envelope so that it is possibly less likely to be stolen by the Post Office employees.So Z will never know who the cash is coming from and it may be stolen from time to time. But‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..Welcome to hell.

        As we move forward as people of the far right (I hope dissidents are ready to go there) we must consider two important things: the individual and the state. But there is one far more important to consider: the nation. When we think of the ‚Äúnation‚Äù  we are normally thinking of ‚Äúthe nation-state‚Äù but the STATE is NOT the nation. The ‚Äúnation,‚Äù is not the same thing as the state.‚ÄúContemporary libertarians often assume, mistakenly, that individuals are bound to each other only by the nexus of market exchange. They forget that everyone is necessarily born into a family, a language, and a culture. Every person is born into one or several overlapping communities, usually including an ethnic group, with specific values, cultures, religious beliefs, and traditions. He is generally born into a ‚Äúcountry.‚Äù He is always born into a specific historical context of time and place, meaning neighborhood and land area.‚Äù (from ‚Äô93 by a far right academic many here profess to know of)‚ÄúWhile the State is a pernicious and coercive collective concept, the ‚Äònation‚Äô may be and generally is voluntary. The nation properly refers, not to the state, but to the entire web of culture, values, traditions, religion, and language in which the individuals of a society are raised. It is almost embarrassingly banal to emphasize that point, but apparently many libertarians aggressively overlook the obvious.‚Äù (ditto)In the age of ‚Äúidentity politics‚Äù everyone seems to be supporting their own nation EXCEPT for the dumb-ass white people. And this has been going on for some time now. It is high time we present the real right ‚Äî one that takes care of its own.

            Round here there are several antifag and other commie outfits that have been hunting and doxxing AIM members ‚Äì all with the help (and publishing) in the local smut rag.They have somehow got ahold of the private chat system used by AIM as well as other info on communication and meeting protocols. Several people have been harassed by these thugs and the media.The media here characterizes AIM as a ‚Äúneo-nazi alt-right hate group‚Äù or other variant of such.Of course this is to be expected, but your concerns are real.There is a counter intelligence need with groups like AIM to mislead, harass, and doxx the legions of basement dwelling violent fascists.There won‚Äôt be media help of course but they can‚Äôt be allowed to so easily operate either.Trump is not right often but he is right about the media being the enemy. He said ‚Äòfake news media‚Äô is the enemy; I say ‚ÄòAll media is the enemy‚Äô until they prove otherwise. If they don‚Äôt in short order they should be treated accordingly: as a tool of the violent left.

        ‚ÄúThe libertarian movement never got out of the valley of weirdos‚Äù because libertarians tend to be progressives with autism. If you cured their social blindness, you‚Äôd get a bunch of ordinary center-leftists. Uncured, you get ‚Äúmuh individualism‚Äù because most people object to sacrificing (via taxes, regulatory compliance, etc.) for the benefit of others when they perceive no connection to them. They have trouble grasping social relationships except as analytical constructs, and they‚Äôve rationalized the defect into an ideology.

            I think the ‚ÄúLibertarian Movement‚Äù bit is a mis-statement.It‚Äôs more an attitude of mind than a political movement. I use it as a first check on anything: Why does this need anything other than free association? and then, if it does, What‚Äôs the lowest organizational level at which it can be achieved? (Subsidiarity)then, How do we keep it under control?As soon a what is the antithesis of politics becomes a political movement, you know the grifters have taken over.

            It ends with this:
1789: Mayer Rothschild organised the French Revolution, and mass murder of the French aristocracy, to seize control of the French economy by privatising the Bank Of France.
1803: The Bank Of France was privatised and a National Debt, to be paid off by income tax, was fraudulently established.

            I accept that is generally true, but there are exceptions. See Donald Trump, who was encouraged to run as an entertaining pied-piper figure but unexpectedly ended up winning and the establishment has spent the last 3 years trying to overturn that election result. Trump‚Äôs caving on immigration and the wall is confirmation of your idea, though. Our faceless, nameless rulers are there and dictating our fate.

                After Trump‚Äôs election but before his inauguration Oliver Stone‚Äôs series The Putin interviews aired and in it he asked Putin what he thought of trump and what was going to happen and Putin‚Äôs response was, America has a vast bureaucracy, and Trump will be very limited in anything he can do because of it. I think back about that a lot. Putin knew what he was talking about.

                    Yes, i saw an interview with Putin (not sure it was Oliver Stone‚Äôs) and he commented that some great men with great ideas are elected in the U.S., but after that some men in dark suits with black ties visit the elected president, and then after that their policies, especially regarding foreign policy, remain the same neo-con regime-change crazy, meddling policies. Putin knows. But for him, Russia would be a rump state, looted by western and Russian jews; he had to imprison one and go after others to end it. It‚Äôs still a delicate balance where they‚Äôre trying to rid Russia of corruption. If I see Trump going after Soros, I‚Äôll believe Trump is truly confronting the draining of the swamp. Otherwise, we‚Äôre cooked and it‚Äôs unfortunately going to lead to revolt.

                        Ursula, sadly Trump‚Äôs not the kind of hard man Putin is. Business is not the world of politics and intel in terms of hardball.  Going broke is the worst fate Trump has ever faced.  Playing Russian realpolitik means losers get shot in the basement of the Lubyanka.Trump‚Äôs not been tempered in that kind of conflict and reality, nor has any Western politician.  He will not take the risks necessary to win.  This is a flaw of democracy that Z has often pointed out.  Our officeholders have no sense of ownership in their statesmanship.  When you‚Äôre only renting the car, you‚Äôre not going to risk hurting yourself to save it.Putin‚Äôs more popular with his people than any Western leader  including muh Trump ‚Äì and very importantly, he‚Äôs less popular in Israel than he is at home.

I have no quarrel with your premise that school board seats are often uncontested and therefore present an opportunity.
Implicit in your premise is the proposition that many of us could win and find ourselves on the school board without promulgating our true positions.
However, if we wanted to make a difference, we would soon have to be a difference.
