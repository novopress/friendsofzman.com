        I recall years ago hearing a police doctor say that of all the alleged rape cases he had examined, he only regarded two of them as definite. One was a 60-odd year old nun, the other young teenage girl with severe nettle stings on her back. The others he regarded as doubtful.Of course he may have been a liar and a fantasist, and I expect today he wouldn’t dare — if he were still alive — to say such a thing. And therein lies the problem: irrespective of all the rapes and acts of sexual violence it is taboo to suggest that some may not be what they claim to be. In stifling any sort of reasonable debate (and for that matter, the exercising of reasonable doubt) over this then the way is open to large, if spurious, claims and insistent demands for lucrative compensation.Which of course no one expected at all.

        “Throw a few broads in jail for 20 years when they are revealed to have falsely accused a man of rape and this problem fixes itself”
And disbar their lawyers.

        Bring back 100 lashes in the public square for actual, provable rapes. That ought to cut down on the number of rapists.

            I’m a proponent of bringing back penal colonies.Rapist Islandhas a nice ring to it. Sex offenders are not fixable so put them in a colony to live out their days.

        Bring back the ducking stool for these bitches. That would cut down on their enthusiasms.
