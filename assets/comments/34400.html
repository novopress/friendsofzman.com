        I hadn’t paid attention to Tammy Bruce. A scissor sister who was the head of NOW back in the day. The farcical character of this rotten system gets more extreme every day.Let’s look at the objective reality of this. The spokeslesbian of the United States State Department, as appointed by the America First President just stated that Israel is the greatest country on earth.The country is gone. Of course, ten days ago there was a metropolitan provincial uprising in a major American port city. A colonizing population revolted against the enforcement of our laws and the provincial governor sided with the colonists. The homeland government of the colonists openly called for their colonists to rebel and vote to strike down taxes on the remittances, the extraction of American wealth sent to the colonizer’s homeland. It also openly declared its hostility by declaring our borders illegitimate and declared their intent to reclaim a territory we acquired through purchase. That territory amounts to 1/3rd of the total territory of the United States. There are over 60 million of the colonizers settled in the United States.What is the United States doing about it? Has it declared war? Has it moved to immediately sanction Mexico and the other Latin American states with their colonizers in America? Has it declared a state of emergency due to a hostile invasion and sent urgent diplomatic missions to those countries? Isn’t the Secretary of State a Latin American? How is he compromised due to this?I could go on. My fellow dissidents you know this. Nope. America must send its armies to the Levant and show everyone, including the seething Historic American Nation, that America First as led by Donald Trump is a farce.I am glad you used the Gordian Knot reference. We don’t need an American Caesar. We need an American Alexander. It is time to stop goofing around, to pull out the sword and do what must be done to save Our country and Our people.

            I had no idea Tammy Bruce was at the State Department until this video came out.  Who would know more about diplomacy than a Cable TV talking head who flips her political affiliation whenever it suites her best? A completely useless person outside the politician system who is there simply to recite lines for the camera.  I keep thinking the system has to collapse, but it staggers on even as it gets more and more absurd.

                I know I have the minority opinion on this, but Trump hiring all these vapid TV talking head figureheads leads me to believe that somebody else is in charge. These people are largely TV talent. What does a TV host know about running things?

                    Of course someone else is in charge, but who and what are their motives?   What oversight do they have and how would they be replaced?  It all points to signs of an unhealthy system that can’t continue much longer, but yet it does.

                Next, we may expect to see Megan Kelly running shops at State.  Sounds like the State Department has become just another coven.
What a joke of a nation.

                Tammy is the “out and proud lesbian” who is also a “conservative”. I’ve heard her in years past. She’s got the Sean Hannity “talking points” handbook right in front of her, and she sauces it up a bit. I hate all these people. They’re all “paid conservatives” much as circus clowns are “paid clowns”. Not one of them has objected to the bombings of Iran. Nope, not there in the playbook.
All these people hate Tucker Carlson now, because he is not buying into this stupidity. And to think I used to believe that NPCs were just lefties.

                (She’s an Italian Catholic. She started with a little radio show in Los Angeles. This is a media war, so Trump is recruiting outside talent.
Those talk-show people? They had to hold their own and defend their arguments in front of a live audience. If you couldn’t keep that audience, you were out. Girlfren has had a lot of experience doing exactly what she is doing now.
She was a national political organizer too.  Plus, well, when she was young, babe wassmokin’.)

            If you go back and look at the transcript of Trump’s speech after the bombing, you will see he always mentions Israel before he does the US, every time. He congratulates Netanyahu before any American official. He congratulates the IDF before he does the US military. He says “God Bless Israel” before he says “God Bless America.” If I didn’t know better, I would say that someone on his speechwriting team is on our side because it just sounded horrible and so obvious while he was saying it.

                “If I didn’t know better, I would say that someone on his speechwriting team is on our side because it just sounded horrible and so obvious while he was saying it.”
Or, like Ben Shapiro and Mark Levin, they consider Israel to be more important and are utterly blind to how this comes across. That being said, I wouldn’t rule your theory out. The whole thing was a disgrace.

            Well, thank you, RR. That was an upper deck home run.This morning I heard a clip of Vance explaining that destroying the Iranian nuclear program is squarely in the national interest. Why? Because Iran having nuclear weapons would be “terrible” for the US. He did not go on to explain why that would be, in fact, terrible, for the US or for that matter, any other country.Wikipedia informs me that Iran is the world’s 17th largest country both in land mass and population, and that Israel checks in, respectively, at 149th and 93rd. Let’s have some fun, and check out, say, the Democratic Republic of Congo. 15th and 11th, respectively. Haven’t heard much news from the DRC lately; must be things are hunky dory there.Indonesia (14,4) doesn’t make the news, ever, unless a tsunami wipes out a couple hundred thousand people every so often. Fourth most populous country? Hmm, well India and China beat them, obviously, and then… o look! The USA! One might think that our relations with Indonesia would matter – and maybe they do, to someone in the resource extraction and slave labor business, as the Japanese and the Dutch used to be before ‘new management’.Moral: if it is a vital American interest to wipe out the Iranian weapons program, what if Indonesia or Congo decides to go for it too? (OK, Congo, it would be something like “the old negro nuclear program”.)Seriously. The history of nuclear proliferation shows, clearly, that the USSR took non-proliferation seriously, unlike the USA. Britain and France were “helped”; China was not. The last thing that the Soviets wanted was that the Chinese had nuclear capability. It’s hard to imagine India or Pakistan figuring this out on their own; at a guess, India worked it out, then certain “helpers” from the US saw to it that the Pakis could fire back.And then there is the “Sampson Option”. What is that, exactly? If Israel possesses this “option” then it came to them from the USA. And now the possessors of said option, andtheir sugar daddy, call Iranian capability “terrible”. And yep, right on cue many of my normiecon friends and relatives are anti-Tucker now because he has called bullshit on it all.So, the strategic bombing of Germany did not demoralize the people, or even cripple (until late in the war) Germany’s military productivity. Millions of leaflets were dumped out of the B-17s, explaining that “we just want peace”. Look at Iran now. If I were an Iranian at this moment, I would want retribution. It’s not Iike Iran is going anywhere; after all the “surgical strikes” its government, society and infrastructure will remain intact. PIssed off, and proud.Under the current ruler it is all but illegal to question loyalties at this point. America is nowadays something like Poland after its partition between empires: some of it belongs to China, some of it belongs to Israel, some of it belongs to the Cartels, and a bunch of it belongs to Blackrock or similar “wealth managers”.

        Three comments today:1. One thing I noticed over the weekend just from scanning normie comments in the local paper is that they think MAGA is all in on bombing Iran. When I tried explaining to people that John Bolton, Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz and Zioclops Dan Cuckshaw are not MAGA, I know I was getting blank stairs on the other side of that keyboard.2. People on the non-establishment right were livid about what was going on, including me. I’ve been so radicalized by these buffoons, and I am actively cheering for Iran to get nukes so that nobody can push them around anymore. This is exactly the same split that happened on the right when Drunken W bumbled into Iraq. They never learn from the past.3. I’m not voting anymore. It’s not even worth the effort. We’re never going to do better than Trump and the system is aligned against our priorities. This country is flatlining.

                    Pausing illegal immigration is *not* rolling it back.  The average voter needs to learn the difference and “catch wise”.  It is quite possible to stop illegal immigration, or reduce to negligible proportion of entrants, deport a million or two IA’s through whatever means, and at the end of Presidency have 13 to 18M IA’s firmly ensconced in American society.  The next President can “do a Biden” or worse, “a Reagan” and we are not better off, perhaps worse off, than if we’d done nothing at all under Trump.To imply that voting for Trump due to “immigration” was a “good” reason to vote, is not yet a known fact, but a work in progress.  Success cannot yet be evaluated.Disclaimer: I too voted for Trump.

            I never use my phone for anything like this, but I was talking to a friend yesterday about Iran and was telling them things they had never heard before (I was on with a couple on speaker) and while I was doing that I happened to visit on an old bookmark for Conservative Tree House. It’s one left over from a couple phones ago, I never go there anymore, It was scary just how unhinged the normies there were about Iran and worse than that just how cult-like they were about Trump. He is literally Jesus to them it seems. He can do no wrong, must not be questioned and is put here to pave the way for the Messiah. Zionism has devolved into a death cult and the USG seems to be all in on it. May God have mercy on us, not them they want to end the world. We don’t.

                            I’ve been banned from Amren too – didn’t bother to find out why.  And I was banned from Counter Currents.  And although I tried to choose my words carefully, I was banned from what I thought was just book reviews on Amazon, but now I’ve learned I can’t even make a product review (the rare time I am motivated to).

        Then What? is absolutely the correct framework for strategy development. But even before “then what?” are the predicates: strategic planning assumptions. These describe the parameters/constraints of strategy development. This is just first-order thinking: what is reality? Here are the pertinent ones:1) No legitimate government in Iran (with popular support) will be friendly to Israel2) We have no means to control a “regime change” process in Iran3) Israel will fight to the last American dollar and soldier4) We cannot sustainably project our military power in IranThe problem we have is not only do we not ask “then what?”, we don’t even make an honest assessment of the reality/strategy parameters.

            The assumption that there’s no second-order thinking involved is not obvious to me. As you so concisely itemized, nothing will turn Iran into another Turkey, so the best outcome for our most sacred ally, is a new Libya, a failed state.
Ascribing to stupidity what can easily be explained by malice is a dangerously naive proposition, it is what they want you to think, their insanity defence. Our rulers are not idiots, they’re evil: idiocy would entail that they sometimes did the right thing by chance, but this never happens.

                Even the evil you describe would be preferable, in the sense of having a rationale, to the suicidal chaos underway. I’m with Z on this one: it is magical thinking coupled with a tiny bit of the malice you described. The one aspect of Z’s analysis that is suspect is that there was first order thinking involved.

                    Yes Jack. That was basically my point. Zman is absolutely right that there’s no second-order thinking. My point was that the first-order thinking, if it’s happening, isn’t grounded in realistic predicates. Felix correctly inserts the possibility of malice.

                I think there’s tons of second order and even third order thinking and planning going on. There are plenty of capable men in the admin who could foresee this tar baby getting worse. The scariest part is that they decide on these courses of action despite being shown the downside. God’s All Stars are dictating to the US government what they will do and Trump is going along with it. Is it from evil, fear, stupidity? I think Trump wants to pivot to make “big deals” and had some usual suspects convince him this was going to be quick. Not that it matters. This might be one of the worse own-goals in US presidential history.

                    “…there’s tons of second order and even third order thinking…”One might logically come to that conclusion as well.  What does the “blob” most fear about MAGA?  That the promised domestic agenda is implemented.  What has been to greatest failure of all previous “conservative” Presidencies?  That they become distracted with foreign affairs/entanglements and inevitably disengage from internal affairs.Seems to me we are seeing this now.  True, there are special nuances that only Trump could have presented to this “distraction theory”, but that’s to be expected with any President—one tailors one’s “plan” to the specifics of the victim.  The Ukraine fiasco was an initial distraction failure as Trump handled that quickly (as in not grabbing the bait) and stayed focused on internals, e.g., DOGE.  Another distraction was quickly cooked up, and here we are now.This new distraction is only beginning.  Trump will/may now be caught in a war that he cannot control in time for the midterms.  That could be the goal. Midterm reversal will cripple the Trump Presidency.  So far all is working as best as could be planned via second and third order thinking.

                        Trump’s domestic plan is wildly popular and despite the best efforts of the narrative creators, was only getting more popular. Just a few weeks ago I saw a CNN clip where they were absolutely incredulous that Trump remained popular despite all the pictures of sad brown people. The thing in LA was an absolute disaster for Newsom and the Democrat party and Americans mostly encouraged Trump t ramp up the deportation and go after the illegals and funders of these riot campaigns.So what does the ‘blob’ do, fluff up Trump to go to war with Iran. Not only does it lead to distraction, but it also splits the 2024 MAGA coalition. The tension was always there (we all know why Mark Levin and Ben Shapiro got on board, let’s be real) but now instead of discussing domestic issues, everyone is arguing over Iran. It was, sorry to say, evil genius at work.Trump’s support is probably going to plummet as his base falls apart and he will double down because, well, he’s Donald Trump. Not to mention he is getting glazed by all the people who normally hate him and he is soaking it in and loving it right now.

                            Well said.  I’ve been quite surprised when skimming comments (even given most are from stupid women) on both normal and cuckservatard sites, to see that the vast majority have been celebrating the enforcement of immigration law.  Yes, there’s far too much of ‘go back and come in the right way,’ but most appear unmoved by brown sads and even seem to realize most aren’t telling the truth and full story.All presidents since the beginning of the 20th century have preferred foreign to domestic affairs.  Much simpler (on the surface) to solve when viewed through the myopic ‘merkin lens, and much more easily used to arouse patriotic fervor.  That’s what I’ve seen far too much of, of late – “Go USA, thank you for your service, the military is back, rah rah rah.”  It’s not accidental that that fervor and fever and fury have the same Latinroot – it’s all emotion and zero thinking.

Exactly.
‘It was, sorry to say, evil genius at work’
Evil yes, genius no.  It was an obvious move.  The surprise to the base was trump acceding so readily, and dumping his domestic agenda so quickly.

                        The Great Replacement is the primary goal of the Blob, no doubt. But let’s not mitigate the profound stupidity and lack of thinking on the part of the Trump Administration that led to this suicidal mission. It is a toxic combination. I wouldn’t even discount Netanyahu totally slithering out of it somehow and leaving the United States solely holding the bag, if it is possible.

                                TGR is the be all, end all, the alpha, the omega, the most existential crisis of Western history.
It would not be surprising AT ALL to learn that what seems increasingly like a kabuki war with Iran was launched to distract from the insufficient rate of deportation, kind of a reverse Wag The Dog.

                    Is there second and third-order tactical planning taking place? Probably. I’m questioning the strategy, not the tactics. Nobody alive and sentient since Desert Storm could impute any kind of logic into the apparent strategy here. It defies 30 years of actual results.

                        Grand strategy basically doesn’t exist anymore because our system only allows 4 year planning cycles. Yet another reason why we won’t last much longer.My point about 2nd order thinking was that I think it’s a mistake to think that everyone is just a bumbling fool throwing darts at a board and not capable of understanding 2nd/3rd order effects. Just because we can’t see the sense doesn’t mean it isn’t thought out. You’re right, this isn’t going to end well, but I tend to think this is very thought out at least by the Rasputin-like characters in the blob. I think Trump thinks he’s going to bob and weave out of this and has no idea what sort of damage he’s done to his support base.

                            Fair enough. I would suggests that, even if there’s second-order thinking, it’s based on false premises. I agree about the lack of “grand strategy”. It’s a problem. But we can also have “grand strategies”, like NAFTA, that are pursued for many years and are just bad ideas.

                Felix:  Brilliantly said.  Because stupidity abounds in the fedgov, most find it more palatable to accept that as prima facie evidence of incompetence and failure.  But malice there is aplenty, and it often and easily goes hand-in-hand with stupidity.  There is quote after quote, time after time, proving that AINO’s government despises America’s heritage people.  And when jews, womyn, neocons, and others tell you they hate you and that their loyalties lie elsewhere, take them at their word.

            ‘We kicked their ass!’ is not the cry of honest assessors. Nor of mature actors upon domestic and foreign stages. It’s embarrassing.I am no mooslim lover, to say the least. Best thing I can say is they’re deceived and deluded. Islam isn’t even a good sell, story wise. They just wanted their own deity, like the Near East folks had. The idea that Gabriel dictated all that rigamarole koran is hilarious.If they want to be my enemy, I can sure do that. But right now my enemies are in America, Britain, and the modern West. The mooslims haven’t persecuted me in my home and in my workplace. That was other Americans that did that, white female ones largely with the backing of neutered, careerist men.

                Yes. We won every major battle in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and still lost the wars or the peace processes.

It don’t get any more contradictory and womanly than that.__________Hey, Silva. Do you remember that meeting with John Jones and that old man they called U.S. Christmas, down near El Rito?– That old man they called U.S. Christmas? – Rlght. Si?Seems John stepped on one of U.S.’s boots one night they was both in town.Old U.S., he’d been out hunting buffalo for six months.  Now, he was mean and testy and damn near blind drunk.He had on a pair of these flat-heeled, about half-length Wellington boots.  Them boots was the only thing he owned he put any store in.  And John stepped on one of them.That old man just stepped back and said:“Let’s get to it.”So John said to U. S:“If you’re gonna get that riled over a pair of foreign, lady-looking boots we just might as well get the ball rolling.”So they went in the middle of the street.And they took the 10 steps.And John put three holes right through that old man’s chest.(‘Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid’)

                A problem is that we have for generations been able to provide both “guns and butter” wrt our military adventures.  Most of the public is removed from the effects of our government’s wars of aggrandizement.  Somewhat similar to Israel, except for this latest fiasco of their cities being bombed.  Reactions to our latest war of choice is as expected, the populace loves it so far (not all, but enough).  We feel no pain, suffer no consequences—yet.I have expressed a plan—pipe dream really— to prevent such pain-free folly.   I call it “pay for play”.  In all conflicts, we require a draft to fulfill needed manpower—complete random selection, with no deferments—if you can’t carry a weapon because you’re a fat slob, you will shovel shit on a stateside posting, but you don’t get to sit home and watch sportsball while others die for your ego.Next, everyone is assessed a special assessment (tax) to pay for the war, no exclusions—just a line item on the bottom of your return added to whatever you’d have paid without a war going on.  They’d be a minimum assessment and no maximum.  Everybody forks up their “share”.  Not completely without precedent.  Nixon in the final stages of our Vietnam fiasco and with rising inflation, proposed such a tax.  The war was settled within a year.

                    Everyone in government and near government should have to pay 50% on whatever their take home pay is and their children are mandatory draftees.  Of course, this could only be done by the elite who support all these ruinous policies.
The slobs have absolutely no say whatsoever in war or any other government policy.  Why should they pay just because they are flag waiving?  What are they going to do?  Write a strongly worded letter to their congressmen?
No matter who we vote for, we get more of the same.

America’s gonna send THESE overgrown children to war?  Who have never been homeless, never done without, never shivered through a night, never been in jail, never been in a fight, never even been UNSAFE.  Their existence is cocooned; their mentality is smartphones and vidgames.
Zero immediate consequences for Americans, therefore USA!  USA!

                Yes.  The Vaxx is probably the worst thing they did to us.   They have covered up millions of outright dead, many more with their organs destroyed and many generations of Americans who will never be born.
Trump will still not admit any of that and the Vaxx is still allowed.  It is getting harder to think of him as anything but a Trojan Horse.

                    Too harsh.  Trump is not the one to pick up your anti-vax stance directly.  Too high a position/effort, too low a goal.  Trump did however pick the best anti-vax people to head the government agencies in direct control.  That “ain’t nothing”.

            It’s awfully convenient to drop into an event and criticize the bad to worst outcomes as though the past 15 years of maneuvering circumstances to arrive at this single consequential and unpleasant solution didn’t happen.Barack Obama worked hard to give gifts to Iran through his execrable donations and useless agreements.  And Iran was happy to play political games with the rest of the world until they had the means to turn a tiny nation into a plate of glass and exert their control over the entire Middle East.If you want to wax eloquently about second and third-order thinking, we can sit back and wonder what the nature of the Middle East would be this summer after Tel Aviv disappears in a blinding flash of light and the next caliphate is announced by Iran.

                You can tell Samuel Adams is a brainwashed slave because he managed to bring Obama into this discussion along with copious amounts of zionist propaganda. You’re still butt hurt about the pallets of THEIR cash being returned to them?  The JCPOA was just a ruse Iran was using to create a bomb and turn israel into “a plate of glass”? The same agreement that placed the IAEA spies throughout all their nuclear facilities?  It’s coming out that those spies then transferred info on Iranian nuclear scientists to israel for assassinations.  And you still think it’s Iran trying to “exert their control over the entire Middle East.”  OK buddy, clearly you’ve been propagandized for so long the only recourse we have is to lambaste you into oblivion.

                    These people are everywhere. The guy with a small hat on fox news told him Iran wants to blow up the world, so he eats it up without a moment of introspection or reasoning. He probably has a US/Israel flag on his pick up truck and thinks Brawdo will water the crops.

                Why should I give a shit “what the nature of the Middle East would be this summer after Tel Aviv disappears in a blinding flash of light and the next caliphate is announced by Iran”?

                I find nothing inaccurate in this comment. The cash belonged to the previous government and the Iranians, and we didn’t let the thieves steal it – it will be returned to the people after the restoration.Mossadegh and the Ayatollahs were the color revolutions.
As to that last, well, Iliketo wonder about such things. I volunteer!

            Since I disagree, the real Then What is getting Israel todefeat itself.
Iran will be either a giant Palestine, or…I optimistically posit this gives America has a chance to be the good guy.  They used to see us like that.  It’s a restoration, not a “regime change.”
Oh. My.  Israel will be involved, even against its wishes.  Well, boo effing hoo.
What a success in this offers is breathing room to deal, then, with the invaders, and all the other crap.  The Noticing is rolling under its own power now, after that we’ll start to Notice the Replacement.

        The only way out is to end the Israel lobby and that means tanks in the streets.
It is time.
ICE agents were brutalized this weekend in LA and no one in D.C. cared. Many supported the savages.
D.C. needs regime change, and not solely or primarily at the top. Trump has destroyed his presidency, but it presents an opportunity to take out the trash.

            I’m probably going to be downvoted for saying this but I’m not impressed by the reports I’ve seen detailing the “injuries” suffered by the ICE agents. It seems to be mostly cases of having been shoved, tripped, falling down, and bruising their knees. Or being spat on. Golly.I support law enforcement (otherwise why have laws?) but have some difficulty with the idea that injuries to LEO’s are somehow more heinous than the same injuries to an average citizen.I’m not saying the protesters are entirely innocent in these cases but the charges that have been filed do seem to be more than a little overblown.If I’ve missed some reports describing an agent’s truly serious injury I’ll appreciate being pointed to them.

I agree entirely.  I’m just saying some of the assault charges I’ve seen seem to be overblown.
… and if and when the Left regains control of the government and starts using LEO’s to put downourprotests, this stuff might come back to bite us.

                Because so many ICE agents are the same as the police, and the secret service, and the border patrol.  Tons of mestizos, womyn, fat bureaucrats, and badged bullies who are accustomed to the compliance of law-abiding Whites.

                        I’m with Jeffrey Zoar about this – the degree of injury is irrelevant – what must stop is the resistance of illegal aliens.  It never crossed my mind to ‘protest’ or ‘demonstrate’ in any of the countries I lived – I was a guest (whether private or official).  It was not my business how they conducted their business, because it was not my country.Whether they be mestizos or jews or muslims or pajeets, they all feel entitled to live wherever they choose and behave however they’d like.   That’s because the origins of the phrase “When inRome. . .” and its meaning go back possibly to St. Augustine and/or an English play of 1599.  The sentiment is only found in White culture and expected of White people.

People close their eyes and imagine ICE, the FBI, the Justice Department, the NSA etc. are staffed by middle-aged white men with serious faces and decades of experience.
Mebbe in 1970 . . . .
We must assume that ICE, like everything else, long has been corrupted by the endless entries of homos, transvestites, feminists (women), and borderline-pathological powerjunkies.

                    Oh, I agree, resistance to immigration enforcement must be put down.  I’m very much in favor or charging them with obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting, rioting, racketeering, insurrection, treason, etc.  Charges that I think have more teeth and are less likely to gain them any sympathy from people who are still on the fence.
But we’ve come a long way from the assertion that ICE agents have been “brutalized”, haven’t we, when the argument is that the severity or extent of their injuries is “irrelevant”?

        Donald was hired to clean up New Amerika, to change the present woke-fem domestic agenda to something resembling sanity and tradition.I got ninety days of (mild) paperwork-strikes on rad-Prog funding sources, and then nada. The honcho of DOGE — about the only pro-American element I saw operating — walked away and called Le ‘Orange a dweeb.The cancer is in OUR body, it’s not Out There Somewhere. The war is inside the U.S., not in Iran or Yemen or the Trobriand Islands.This distraction and dodge to the ME tells me that Donald and his administration do not have what it takes to reform the satanic beest of a nation that America turned into. That means harsh action taken against the Rad 1/3 of the citizenry that have led and/or profited from the anti-male, anti-white, anti-Christian elements that STILL run all U.S. institutions.DEI and Big Feminism have not been budged, despite Trump’s proclamation.  USAID barely scratched the surface and now I have no choice but to view it as a deke from the getgo, a stale cracker tossed to his base. Either Donald never really wanted to save America, or he was scamming from the escalator and onward.

            Prior to the MAGA stuff, Trump was a liberal NY billionaire with a dodgy business record and a scandalous personal life. He recognized that the standard GOP politician had lost touch with the concerns of the typical voter and that the country was in obvious decline. Hence, MAGA. He rode MAGA to the White House but it was more of a satisfaction for his ego rather than a steely determination to crush the forces ruining the nation and reverse the decline. The usual suspects worked him in his first term and are doing so now. That little burst of energy at the beginning of this term has petered out and we are back to business as usual with USA as Israel’s boytoy.

        “The only way out is to end the Israel lobby and that means tanks in the streets.”How would tanks in the streets curb the power of the Israel lobby? The chosen ones have possession of the commanding heights of finance, media, politics, and academia. The rubes live out in Dogdick, Arkansas. Once Trump got into office he criminalized any support for Gaza as “antisemitic.” He deported any foreign students supporting Gaza and successfully threatened any university allowing free speech (which is also antisemitic). He is best buddies with the Zionist elite. He is not the Fuhrer, who had a clear strategic plan for curbing the influence of the chosen ones and went about it from day one.

            Christopher Bjerknes suggested that the expulsion and deportation of the students protesting for Gaza was likely an attempt to prevent them from organizing protests and promoting solidarity in the US Muslim community once war was started with Iran.There are probably many reasons he did that but he may have been planning war with Iran from the beginning.

        I still held out some hope that Trump would do the right thing and just back away from this honey badger. Him getting up and bragging about us taking the lead was just completely depressing. We have absolutely no autonomy and are getting dog walked by a foreign power. It should be blatantly obvious to anyone paying attention and while there’s a lot of push back, there’s still too many from our side who think this is just a game. “We’re not at war” I’ve heard. As if war is something you get to decide you’re not in or not while you drop bombs. FFS if you punch someone in the mouth, and they punch back, you don’t get to say we’re not in a fight.This derails any foreign policy Trump thought he was going to accomplish and probably any domestic as well. He’s done and so is any hope that immigration was going to get solved.

But about this:“Some sort of mass psychosis has swept the ruling class where they are convinced that their purpose in life is to serve the needs of this flyspeck of a country halfway around the world.”There is what I’ll just call “the Money Power” that rules the world. Its home and HQ is “The City” (of London), and it has its hangers-on around the world, the two main ones being Paris and Wall Street.The State of Israel was established by that Money Power to gain a permanent foothold in the region and to function as its attack dog to ensure that no power could arise in that region other than the Money Power, which uses the military power of “sovereign” countries at will to ensure its goal of controlling of the oil and gas fields of the ME.The purpose of the Midnight Hammer operation was to begin the process of destabilizing Iran internally. Call it “regime change” or whatever; the label is immaterial. Just as Israel was able to attack Iran that first night from *inside* Iran, so their agents inside Iran will very soon begin their campaign of destabilization, which will involve the usual assassinations and car bombs and all the rest of it. It will, of course, be presented as a popular uprising “against the brutal theocratic tyranny of the mullahs . . . ” blah blah blah; the propaganda will write itself. It is already begun; one hears it everywhere already. Every arrow in the “regime-change” quiver will be used. Eventually–in a year or two–Iran will be overthrown and broken up into pieces–the Arab part, the Baluchi part, the Turkish/Turkoman part, etc.At that point, West-friendly regimes will be installed–in “Rump Iran” it might even be Pahlavi, the former Shah’s son and heir, as incredible as that might seem today–and then the usual suspects will have direct access to Russia’s soft underbelly via the Caspian Sea.The Money Power tried but failed to “burglarize” Russia via the Ukraine in an attempt to overthrow Russia, break it into pieces, and steal its vast natural resources, thereby resuming the rape and robbery of Russia that Putin’s advent put an end to. So now, they will approach Russia from the south. That answers the question “Why now?” with regard to why it was so vital to stop Iran from getting nukes–even though Iran has been “only weeks away from getting nukes” for the past thirty years.Turkey will take one third of Iran’s present-day territory just as Turkey aided and abetted the recent overthrow of Syria for the benefit of the Money Power that has just induced (forced?) Mr Trump to betray not only his voters but AINO itself. South Azerbaijan–the NW third of Iran–is populated by Turks, and it has a long border with Turkey. The current president of Iran is Turkish (although born within what is now Iran).I think we can expect the internal destabilization campaign inside Iran to begin any time now.So that is why the lunatics in Washington are prepared to go to any length to defend what you rightly call “this flyspeck of a country halfway around the world.” Because it pays. And very handsomely, too. And they mean to keep it that way. Unfortunately for us, “things fall apart” and no war plan ever survives its first contact with the enemy.Buckle up.

            BRILLIANT. Even though you briefly touched on it, the results of the attempt to dismantle and rape Russia have been total failure thus far. I can see the same outcome with the attempt on Iran, but granted it is not at all certain. It will be interesting to see what follows when Israel is directly attacked by major powers, because that is coming unless the City of London gives a stand down order soon..
Stellar comment, man.

                You know, now that I come to think about it, somebody (Col. Macgregor?) has pointed out that the Iranian gov’t long ago divided Iran up into 50-odd independently functioning military regions so that in the event of an invasion or protracted bombing campaign, every one of the regions could function without resorting to the central state apparatus, thus turning that vast country into 50-odd different regions, each and every one of which would have to be conquered and then OCCUPIED by an enemy power. So you are right: Iran is not going to be conquered by the treacherous Mssrs Trump and Vance or by anybody else. ALL war is logistics, so there ain’t no way.

            The powers that be have been so far fortunate beyond their wildest dreams in having an enemy like Iran.    Their leadership is even more incompetent than our own, if that is even possible.   The question is will Iran compensate, improvise and overcome?    The U.S. and Israel had better hope not.

                    I don’t think clown world is planning an invasion/conquest of that type.  They don’t have the troops to do that.  They might have been looking at having their ISIS types wage a kind of civil war but with what you have pointed out that looks like it would be pretty difficult.
Like normal clown world has probably bitten off more that it can chew. They just don’t know it yet.

                I just checked the chart for Oil going back a year. Yes, it jumped quite a bit during the recent excitement. Nevertheless, even its recent peak isbelowspot as recently as late January, to say nothing of much of 2024. You probably can’t find a more Mideast-sensitive commodity, and what the chart says is that the latest missile trading is not a real big deal.
Oh did I mention it’s dropped about 9% just today?

        “If the Trump people had a realistic understanding of Israel and the Israel lobby, they would know they are dealing with hostile aliens who look at the United States as a Walmart during a ghetto riot. They would know how to treat them as adversaries, rather than allies or clients.”Jews, not all but most, divide sapient humanity into 3 categories. First, their own kind, for whom there is an almost ritualized high-trust code of conduct for interaction. Second, obedient and decorous slaves who have bent the knee/kissed the Wailing Wall. These can continue to exist as long as they are useful and nonthreatening. All others are in category 3, enemies who have not yet either been subjugated or killed.Donald Trump keeps trying to operate on the assumption that there is some magical mythical 4th category: goyim who can cooperate with Jews as equal beings on matters of shared interest. It is understandable if one has a bubble of Jews around one who fall into the demographic sliver of “not all” which includes honorable and decent people like Stephen Miller and wife.However, the Jews starting wars and trying to lasso us into them are not the exception. They see Donald Trump, for all his money and wealth and power and status, as just another slave testing his shackles. At least one faction of them had quite enough of his disobedience and tried to shoot him twice. Both shooters were extras in Blackrock recruitment videos. What are the odds? roflma, pretty good, actually.How can there be a diplomatic solution to the problem these people pose to our existence? Keep in mind that Netanyahu and his Israelis are far far less hostile to our existence than the more overtly transnational Jewish operators in Europe and America. I would support us defending Israel, as long as American nationalists were holding the whip hand. However, American nationalism was destroyed by Jews by the close of the 1960’s, so Israel is going to be on its own when the American polity they destroyed twitches its last death throe.“The goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists… Keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as ‘the white race’ is destroyed – not ‘deconstructed’ but destroyed.” Noel Igatiev, Harvard

            Too early to know, really. War is good for the MIC. Plus all the second-order, MIC adjacent businesses. Give that a few days for the dust to settle and see what was real and what was not even coat-tails.
Oil is not terribly surprising. China will insist the Straits of Hormuz remain open. Not only do they get an obscene amount of oil from there, but they own a super-majority of the gas fields. Keep the Straits open or Chinese arms stop flowing into Iran.

        Brian Berletic on his websiteThe New Atlasmakes an interesting case that it isnotIsrael that is forcing Trump’s hand, but rather Israel is the proxy for the US deep state that seeks to eliminate Iran as a way to weaken China and eventually turn back to regime change in Russia.  I’m not fully convinced, because I think he underestimates the considerable role of Jewish influence  in the United States, but his point of view is worth considering.

                I’m pretty pro-PRC and I think Berletic deliberately puts the arrow of causality ass-backwards because Third-Worldism and bloviating about US Imperialism are what his Chinese and Russian paymasters want him to be messaging.
Russian and PRC ruling classes strictly stick to the First Rule of JQ Fight Club because little upside for them to do otherwise and some old idealogical pieties need to be observed for public consumption.

        It seems Trump has settled back into his first term habit of just doing whatever retarded things his handlers tell him &amp; then going on twitter to boomer post about how amazing it is that he’s stabbing his base in the back.
At this point the less I know about what he’s up to the better. I had enough of his flip flopping that always somehow ends in favor of maintaining the status quo from his first term. Now that he’s back at it I’m just plugging my ears &amp; reminding myself that at least kamala isnt in office.

        If the Iranians are smart, they will try to keep this between them and the Israelis. They may actually be able to win a war of attrition, provided the Chinese and Russians keep them stocked with missiles. Trump will have some difficulty authorizing more strikes without a direct causus belli. In this environment, even a false flag might be recognized as such.

            Right. And that is why they would be foolish to close the Straits. Threaten, maybe, but not do it. China has too much at stake. The Chinese arms would stop flowing if the oil and gas (something like 75% Chinese-owned) did.

        We are told simultaneously that Iran is a suicidal death cult of irrational freaks who do not value life and they are also, at the exact same time, Iran is full of rational, sober-minded who value their lives too much to retaliate against the USA. Make it make sense!The only way the cancer gets cut out is if Trump tells the Israelis and the neocons “no”. We now know that Trump is not willing to do this, which means that they are the ones in charge. They want us in a war with Iran so they are going to get a war with Iran. Maybe they would have preferred us to go all-in immediately, but step-by-step is fine by them. Even if this leads to a full-throated revolt of MAGA, well that is what official DC wants to see. If 50% of the people revolt, that means 50% get on board with the lunatic neocon 2002 agenda, which is good enough for them.

        Trump is a busted flush and isn’t worth discussing any longer.Ukraine consumed so much of the west’s ordnance it is no longer possible to keep Israel going regardless of whether we want to or not.  And what remains is known to be inferior to what Russia is producing (in prodigious amounts).The near future is very clear, regarding the US.  The national debt is reneged on, the USD loses reserve status, the global empire implodes and collapses, most of the immigrants (legal or illegal) leave, and the federal government collapses.  This leaves individual states, and corporations to sort things out best they can.  How can this scenario not happen, given the dilapidated state of virtually all our cities and infrastructure?LLM based “solutions” are not going to be a real factor once this nation is forced to deal with reality again.  And Israel is on its own, for the first time in its history.

        The internal dynamics of the U.S. are locked up, as you say, under the current system.So it implies someone comes along who breaks those rules somewhat, who was what Trump was supposed to be.  He seems to have no way forward, and a successor faces the same structural resistance.Part of the impasse might change if Iran manages in a few weeks to destroy a couple of hundred of the most important infrastructure elements in Israel, making it nonviable.  I think that was Iran’s strategic plan all along, and looks possible.A collapsed Israel, with refugees streaming out looking for other places in the world with lights and hot showers, gets hard to justify major military action for.  The remnants of  MAGA is already forming resistance and if Israel is clearly failing, the optics of committing military resources will get difficult.  Maybe this unsticks the situation Trump finds himself in, though he will be politically weakened from the whole bombing episode.How the Neocons actually react when they realize that Iran didn’t need nukes to break Israel, is uncertain.  A war declaration against Iran for revenge is something I would  suspect, but we don’t have the munitions in quantity after Ukraine, and ships are no match for hypersonics, so if war is declared, it will likely go badly.  The left is already primed to go into the streets pushing the unpopularity of a war with Iran, with parallels to the Vietnam protests.  Trump would find this to be a different set of obstacles to what he has now.  The  successor to Trump would really see the end of the Empire, and that brings structural changes.  There is no gas left in the tank politically or financially for  anything beyond the current conflict.

        If Trump really was the chaos agent many people claim he is, he might well sever diplomatic relations with Israel, shutter the respective embassies, and expel all Jewish non-citizens (particularly Israelis) from AINO. This would be the ultimate in rebellion. Almost to the level of reestablishing Jim Crow. Both maneuvers would be necessary for recuperating America from the current ruins. Both are as far from possible as traveling to Betelgeuse on a unicycle.

        “If the Trump people had a realistic understanding of Israel and the Israel lobby, they would know they are dealing with hostile aliens who look at the United States as a Walmart during a ghetto riot.”﻿Now that is a great phrase that sums up modern American society.2nd order thinking is no longer American or White sad to say. It also infects corporations. The rule in a Corp is “good idea boss!” if you ask what if something doesn’t work, you are a can’t do, not a can do, person. Once you get that perception of you, your career track just points to the door. You are no longer wanted.All of this is far worse now that the tribe controls the levers of power and women dominate the managerial class.I have always liked the old adage that the easiest way to improve your looks is to hang around ugly people. China is viewed rightly as powering ahead not just because they are but by having smart men at the top of organizations who don’t view the society as a Walmart during a looting spree they look great and sane in comparison.

        Then what? Russia will win in Ukraine. A lot of very pissed off former Ukrainian military will be unemployed. Many of them will be highly skilled at building and operating combat drones. The people that wrought the destruction of their country are not to be found in Moscow, but elsewhere. Betrayal is bitch. May we wish them Godspeed in their quest for justice.

        I was hoping I was wrong, but when Trump was reelected, many thought he could go balls to the wall with his agendas without worrying about blowback from the usual suspects sabotaging re-election efforts. But now I’m wondering if the support of the voters, especially his base are less relevant for him than embracing or at least being less combative with the swamp. He’ll be out of office in 4 years regardless, but the Flimsey Grahams, Mitch McConnell clones, as well as the Hannity’s and Levin’s will still be in place. The NY Post had the headline:“Trump’s ‘spectacular’ Iran strike could carve his place in history as most courageous leader since Ronald Reagan”I wonder how much he feels free from serving his voters, and willing to cave to the deep state agenda, as a gatekeeper instead.

        AIPAC should be designated the foreign agents that they are and their U.S. operations closed down.   Any politician who then takes their bribes should then be subject to long prison sentences.
The criminal enterprises that Israel runs like the Epstein Mossad operation should be investigated and all of the actors put in prison.   Obviously this is impossible in the current reality.
Like the Z man says.   Tanks in the streets.   The more I say it the better it sounds.  I think Trump would be surprised at the support he would have for taking down the Israel lobby.

        The thing about Gordian knot solution, it requires balls. In what vise are the balls of the father who married his daughter out to that tribe?!(Including, putting her through very serious process called ‘Giur’. In case you didn’t know, her name is now Yael.)Importantly, he put his balls in that vise himself, gladly.
It is absolutely bewildering to me that anyone here expected different outcome.

From Friday to Saturday we don’t do anything but hang out with one another. We don’t make phone calls.”[225]When living in New York City, she used to send her daughter to Jewish kindergarten.

        It now appears that the attack on Iran this past weekend was part of an elaborate charade intended to create a face-saving mechanism for ending the attrition war with Israel. The US and Iran agreed to exchange fake attacks on each other in order to mollify public opinion in both countries and motivate Netanyahu to capitulate to a JCPOA 2.0. The latter is now being tabled in the Israeli press. God help us, but this appears to have been a 3D chess move by the Trumpster. If so, Netanyahu will not survive this, and the regime change will have occurred in Israel.

            The only way this could be true is if Ivanka wants her husband as the new leader of Israel.Otherwise, ‘we’ll see’ as Trump likes to say, but CMON how many times, what will it take, seeing rounds of American soldiers coming home missing limbs or with burnt faces that make you want to recoil in horror? Do we have to see that again first before we start thinking 3d chess is, as they say, cope? Even then, would it matter I guess.

        Over the weekend, a whole lotta very intelligent kkk0mmentators came to the conclusion that the Fordow bombing was a LARP [a Live Action Role Play], to make it look as though Netanyahu were in charge of global strategery, when, in fact, Trump ordered the Iranians to empty the Fordow facility and move the equipment to a safe haven [as a face-saving measure for everyone involved].I.e. EVERYTHING now appears to have been a tail wagging a dawg.I’m now even wondering whether Netanyahu himself is LARPing his own role in this melodrama, so that the idiot mizrahim, God bless their little idiot hearts, will keep voting Netanyahu back into orifice.

            The lack of Iranian response allows no other conclusion. While the exact nature of the LARP can only be guessed, at the very least they are lying down and taking it. They should have no fear of a ground invasion to stop them from retaliating with strikes at US bases in the region, but evidently all they can do is shoot at apt buildings in Tel Aviv. Reminiscent of Saddam. As if the same playbook is being rerun. The vote by their parliament to close Hormuz appears as more performative theater, similar to the kayfabe in which our Congress often engages. If reports are to be believed, not a single SAM was launched at US aircraft.

                If reports are to be believed, not a single SAM was launched at US aircraft.This is another indicator that this is all just maintaining kayfabe for the marks.I mean, Iran had clear indications of what sites were going to be hit and a fairly defined window when they would be hit.It’s hard to believe they couldn’t concentrate their air defenses on those locations – radar, missiles, and rotating fighter patrols – for a deterrent effect.I’ve seen the impact photos of Fordow and they could easily br Photoshopped.If any real damage had been inflicted the entire MSM would have it on a 24/7 loop.

Iran made the announcement Monday night in a statement from its Supreme National Security Council after the attack, which Qatar said caused no injuries.

                        There is no way this reported Iranian strike on Qatar could be characterized as robust. Either they are weak/impotent, or they are playing a role. Or both.

                            As degraded as US military capability is, we still  have the capacity to make life utterly miserable for Iran as long as we want to.Other commenters have written about how a country the size of Israel can’t stand up to a country the size of Iran over the long term, even if Israel has better technology. Well, the same thing applies to Iran vs. the US.Even if they are capable of making a much more devastating strike, and it is certain they can, what would be the long term cost for them of such a maneuver?The US is still the most dangerous bully in the region and if you can get the bully to back off bynottaking your best shot then sometimes it is the right, if galling, choice.

                                Vizzini is on the right track here.Iranian leadership is a lot more sophisticated and prudent than the war propaganda has lead us to believe. Russia and Iran are playing a long diplomatic game where Iran becomes the hero of the UN in exchange for nuclear protection and sanctions relief. Whether those are possible for the parties remains to be seen, but the nuclear protection from Russia for Iran would be an extremely strict and limited treaty to prevent Israel and America from deploying nuclear weapons against Iran. Iran will then be able to avoid building a nuclear weapon themselves which would avoid destabilizing the region with nuclear proliferation. Iran will still leave the NPT because IAEA inspections are equivalent to letting Mossad have free access to your entire nuclear program and assassinate all your personnel.Iran will likely deploy a limited shipping embargo on the Strait of Hormuz against NATO countries and continue to bomb Israel in the hope of crippling Israel before the war winds down. Think of it as a propaganda campaign to peel the gulf Arabs away from the West, which will see some quiet success.TheAyatollah’s leadership of Iran has now been vindicated many times over. Regime change will be met with extreme resistance from the Iranian people.I suspect Trump was given a false narrative to deceive him into striking Iran, and Iran, on Russian advice, prudently gave him a ceasefire opportunity. The “Then what?” question falls back to the usual suspects as their regime change operation against Iran backfires over the next week or two. Does Israel fold or go nuclear? Does the Trump admin go mask off and double down on regime change?I favor Israel crumpling into a hysterical ball that begs Iran for a ceasefire that allows them to save face – which will not happen – while screaming at Trump to do something. Trump and his handlers remain a wild card.

                    Much of the early claims of damage seem dubious. Given that, at best, we might have civilian satellite imaging, precisely how are we to assess alleged damage that is done by a munitions designed to penetrate deeply below ground? I suspect a like skeptic’s case can be made for the cruise missile attacks at other targets.In other press I saw (claimed) satellite images of trucks presumably evacuating equipment from Fordow in days or hours prior to the Saturday attack. I’m not “in the industry” (e.g. spying) but those photos seem well within the reach of what is commercially available. These, if true, lend credence to the claim that Iran wisely squirreled the goods away somewhere else. Whether a lucky guess, or they were tipped off, who knows?I’m told that Israel keeps the press on a short leash; how much more so Iran? In sum, we should take any claims from the battles with a grain of enriched U235.

                “Vigilant Fox” has an excellent summary of “Fordow as Face-Saving LARP”:
https://www.vigilantfox.com/p/emerging-theory-suggests-trump-and
The only thing I would add is that it feels as though Netanyahu were also in on the LARP, which, if true, would make the entire fiasco orders of magnitude moar cynical.
Fortunately, we still don’t have any boots on the ground, and we still haven’t lost any air craft carriers…
Maybe there’s something to be said for Face-Saving LARPs?

George Orwell toyed with that idea in “1984”, and Star Trek revived it in the episode, “A Taste of Armageddon”, where humans were dying in wars which didn’t ackshually exist.

                I think that is a huge point, NN. Back when Covid and the Kraine were Current Things… you could get past all the narrative click bait, chattering skulls an talking heads to find reasoned, authoritative and logical info sources that are the lynchpin of dissident politics.once again the jew media is marching in lockstep…but there are no independent voices of reason like their used to be. Maybe I’m articulating this poorly…but everyone involved with this is screaming or emoting to a script. There are no independent voices in either country doing street level interviews. Everything is being decided behind closed doors. Fact checking anything in this is almost impossible.

He also said CNN should apologize to the B2 pilots for doubting that they did a good job destroying the nuke facilities.﻿

        Iran keeps dropping missiles on Israel.  What then?  How does Israel propose to stop that from happening?  It seems Israel has unwittingly signed up for ongoing and endless bombardment.What a sh**show.

            They will probably just nuke Iran and say they had to since our strikes didn’t work. Or they will say Iran nuked themselves maybe. And all the “judeo-christians” will cheer for it and tell us how blessed by God they are now to have seen the skin peeling off of Iranian children as they slowly die in agony and how God loves that, too. And that God also loves them more than you, because you didn’t cheer.

This is not that far-fetched.
Netanyahu is a fanatic who will realize the B-2 bombing was potentially performative and intended to provide an off-ramp for the US.

                    If Trump or the planners wanted an off-ramp. If not, maybe we didn’t just leave all that equipment to the Taliban, and it’s all built up on Iran’s border on a base they don’t talk about. It does seem like a ridiculous and outrageous thing to have done. Who knows. But no matter what the case may be, we know one thing; the American people are not going to get what they want or vote for. But at least this is happening before they could recruit many more willing soldiers thinking they were working for the USA.

        The war in Ukraine is in its fourth year because no one in the West could bother to ask the question, much less answer it.The war in Ukraine has been a resounding success for the people in charge.— Neocons get to see their ancestral enemy bled of men and rubles.  A “free Ukraine” is the lie they use to sell it to Fox News rubes, and the Ukrainian people are just collateral damage.— More importantly, the political class continues to benefit from donor bucks and kickbacks derived from US aid and military contracts. So long as the war drags on, the money flows.Whether it’s foreign military adventures, a disastrous immigration policy, or selling off federal land, our elites and their hired minions only care about short-term profits (well, some also enjoy inflicting pain on normie).  America is a foreclosed home, and the elites are ripping out the copper wiring.The stated agenda is never the real agenda. It always, always, always goes back to a combination of a few fanatical anti-white ideologues and a bunch of Swamp Dwellers cashing in.

        The Bomb-and-invade-the-world brigades invaded Conservative Treehouse over the weekend.  I took great joy in repeatedly asking them “And then what?” Their reactions went through to roof with rage.  They just kept repeating”Iran cannot have nukes,” over and over and over and it was clearly one of those poll tested phrases meant to frighten people into supporting a broader war.  (while denying that was their true goal)So, late today Trump announced a cease fire.  Who knows if it is real, but my goodness have the Israel Firsters lost their shit.  They were 100% convinced we were heading to full on war with Iran.Trump has a strong hand if he chooses to play it.  He should go back to Congress and tell them to declare war on Iran and vote on it or shut up.  You want to watch Republicans slither back under their rocks, that would work well.Then, go do a fundraiser for Ken Paxton who is primarying Cornyn in the Senate.  Raise a bajillion dollars for Paxton.  That’ll bump him 40pts in the polls.  Maybe even get him to retire.  Then find 5 more Repubs and publicly say “you’re next if you don’t pass my bill”.Trump is in a good place, I think.  He can’t be attacked for doing nothing.  And simultaneously he can rightly claim he dropped 420,000 tons of explosives on Iran’s nuclear facilities.  That leave the Israel firsters exposed to public hostility to US troops entering Israel’s war.I still think he would have been better off refusing to bomb. But I can see the logic.  I can also see him telling the Iranians it was coming so they could get their people out of the facilities.If the cease fire is true and holds, the Israel firsters’ heads will explode.

        Trump’s move redounds constructively to several domestic and international issues.
The creep of Sharia in Europe, illegal immigration in America, the Ivies’ promiscuous import of militant foreign students, the gradual erosion of Christian nationhood and American military deterrence.  All are implicated and clarified and assuaged by Trump’s bold move.
What then? can be asked as readily when inaction is policy as it can be when action is taken.  If you ever supported White ethnonationalism, it’s apparent now that you’ve lost the thread

Foreign wars are hugely important because they justify the existence of the MIC. One of the MIC’s key functions is siphoning wealth from taxpayers to the pockets of the people running the MIC.

        I’m still not sure Trump has any real control of our military, and it may in fact be operating completely independent of him.  We saw this during his first term with the missile strike on Syria and the assassination of that Iranian general.
Publicly he has two choices, reveal how weak he is by admitting he has no power, or take responsibility for the attacks and at least appear to be in charge.  Knowing Trump’s ego, it’s plainly obvious which choice he would make.

        A couple of thoughts on this post and the prior mentions of the then-potential operation by our host:I think the term “Pearl Harbor style sneak attack” is not appropriate for what has actually happened (other than it captures a certain imagery concerning the mission’s aerial nature).  Our host has used this terms several times.  It is an effective rhetorical device. Unfortunately, it adds a strong but inaccurate coloring to the operation as conceived and authorized by the Trump administration, and executed by crews and support entities.Trump and his operatives had clearly been warning Iran about what they were planning to do. The nuclear processing sites were plainly identified as potential targets; the method of delivery openly discussed and debated in the media.  There was no real confusion about WHAT he was going to do (if he said: GO). It was only IF, and WHEN. And I don’t think the IF part was seriously in play.There was no “sneak” to it. They knew it was coming. We knew it was coming — the whole world knew it was going to happen.And, yes the Iranians may not be able to see or track the B-2s … but it’s a recognized precept of modern warfare that you attempt concealment and camouflage. Ours is (for now) just better in this arena.  Should we eschew its use?As to the comparison with 1941:  The American general public did not have any idea that there was a real threat to our homeland (if Hawaii could be considered that).  They had only the most vague ideas about Japanese military organization and capabilities, and certainly were not tracking Japanese naval activity.  And there was no recent (or long past) history of direct antagonism between the US and Japan.There was no media saturated social environment; almost no one not in government or the military knew about Japanese operations in China, Korea or Mongolia. Most were absorbed in their own lives.Now, I don’t discount that the Roosevelt administration knew much more. Certainly they had war gamed what and where. And they were working hard on when.The only real “sneak” there, too, was when.  And the Japanese did an excellent job of getting inside of our intel and decision cycles.Really, only the populace was surprised and caught flat footed. That administration, likely was not.So I suppose one could agree that “Sneak” was appropriate 84 years ago – as the whole of our non-govt, non-mil, non-leadership citizenry was blissfully ignorant about the impending blow.  But the same does not obtain now. Trump did not authorize a SNEAK attack, in the sense of doing something dastardly or underhanded.One can disagree with his decision, accuse him of abandoning “America First”, paint him as a neocon or Israeli stooge — whatever one’s motivating beliefs or rational deliberations might demand. But he was not a sneak.What he did was tell them what he was going to do if they did “X”; then he did it.

        Lots of stuff coming next:Is Trump cracking up?Maybe, based on his erratic behavior. Also note he doesn’t have a friendly team of a few dozen people trying to cover for him.He threw his cabinet under the bus. Probably most important for Vance, who may not have the personal charisma to recover politically.Who has the grapes to relieve Trump? Vance? Hegseth? The guy with the football? Would that be any better? Actually, football guy probably would be an improvement.MAGA is crackedMaybe this gives Elon an opening for his proposed party.Trump has probably lost enough support at this point he will lose both houses in the midterms and get impeached.This seriously damages Vance’s chances in ’28. People will vote blue to punish the GOP. All the DIE, USAID, and alphabet soup garbage will come right back.What will Israel do?Personally, I don’t think Netanyahu is going to accept the staged tit-for-tat between the US and Iran. He’s too fanatical.That could mean an Israeli tac nuke is on the table, either on Fordow or the USSNimitz.The other thing to watch for is a 4th of July false flag, probably in Chicago or St. Louis. Then the M$M can run around screaming, “Look, look, those dirty Iranians can hit us right in the heartland!! WW3 GO TIME!!”Bonus points to Jeff Sachs telling everyone in the alt media Bibi is thede factoUS President. I don’t think he is going to awaken enough people in time to slow down events.

        First, let me disagree, so I can then further disagree. Trump is a goddam genius.He walked the tightrope between Scylla and Charybdis, and won.He avoided the trap Bibi set for him.He can reset the neocon policies that have ruined our brand and our nation since 1963.One and Done, no dinking around like Europe or Congress, let Israel handle its mess.Remember, a rightful Prince awaits to replace the regime – they are even talking about him in Japan. That’s what all the wailing sisters are missing. Reza is the Then What.Reza’s not a corrupt neocon/Blackrock puppet, to be used then disposed of.Iran will cut off its own flow of funds, and the oil China needs? Off the coast of Iraq and Iran, huge pipes rise out of the ocean – they fill those tanker ships right on the water.Russia, Pakistan, Turkey, or North Korea will give them nukes? So, they can then radiate Gaza and the West Bank? Russia will give them the drones and tanks she needs grinding in Ukraine?We’re hearing hyperbole because the BRICS are about to lose their mullah discount.The Russian engineers are working at Bushir, where a peaceful nuclear power plant is – we aren’t interested in those, but the Israeli klutzes have already bombed near it. Good for us, bad for them.1,000 more IRGC capos have been killed; if you take out enough mob bosses, the mob is no more. Like post-war Japan, the lieutenants will just go to work for the new regime. This isn’t Bush’s Iraq, where they fired all those guys because they had to sign up for the Ba’athist Party before they could get hired. (The stupid ‘viceroy’ “deBaathified” the government in one fell swoop, so they went to work for the Sons of Iraq.)(And Iranian podcasters such as Tousi in England are very optimistic. Every time they’ve tried to protest, the Regime stirs up another Hezbollah incursion. Hezbollah, oddly, is sitting on their hands, and the mullahs are steamin’. “After all we did for you!”, they cry. This was supposed to be the moment Hezbollah and Hamas were made for.)Here is my list of what “One and Done”, leaving the rest for Israel to do, accomplishes:1. Most importantly, the afterwards optics of what Israel will do will further weaken the tikkun olam deathgrip on American culture;2. a Restoration will settle the Mideast giving balance to BRICS negotiation, since nobody wants a bunch of jihadi gangs running around – this is the benefit to both BRICS and Belt/Road;3. the immediate aftermath will at the same time weaken the BRICS hand, since Iran is Russia’s Caspian gateway to the Global South and China/SE Asia’s oil supply – showing peaceful trade is worth more than discounts offered by the mullah mafiosi; the principals will just do business with Pahlavi, while the Saudis divest from oil to invest in Gaza Riviera and the Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline from the offshore gas fields to Iran.4. Trump paid off his obligation to the Palantir zionists that brought him to the party;5. a retored, stable regime lessens the pressure for a “Second Israel” in Ukraine. Israel and Turkey will create some new militias, of course, but Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis are about to get an extreme pay cut.

            Wow, that’s some take. First what gives you the idea that Eza Pahlavi has any support in Iran? Remember, all except the kleptocrats who were stealing Iran blind wanted him out of power. What they got may have been worse, but Pahlavi was pretty terrible. The son has been living off stolen money for over 40 years now and hasn’t made a peep about freeing Iran until now.Who pays the bills for your Iranian podcasters? Remember probably 90% of the dissidents causing trouble in Iran are in the pay of a foreign intelligence service. Sure, the regime may not be particularly popular but I guarentee you that as the US/Israel gang up on it, the Iranian people will stand with the goverment.

                I guess it depends on if they see him as someone who will bring pride flags and liberal views and the war goes on, just from a different angle, like what happened in Ukraine evidently. Does he have any dancing in high heels as a ‘comedian’ videos out there?

            Thanks for your vision Alzaebo.
I’ll only add that, Trump is, first and foremost, a mask puller.
And so, it appears now that Iran’s retaliation involves the New York/New Jersey axis of Democrats pulling the Impeachment trigger.  They, and the for-hire mobs are the Mullah’s “boots on the ground” in America.
Our domestic enemies are now more exposed than ever!  You’d have to be blind not to see the intersection.
Why the smart set at Z’s blog can’t see the wider picture is beyind me.  I really thought you all were smarter than this.

                A mask puller. Indeed. The Noticing is the only way we’ll break the spell, or we’re doomed. It’s becoming a low thunder. Casualties will occur.
I just spent a year and a half near prostrate with despair over, well, let’s just call it something that didn’t happen. Enough. They must work out their rage and grief.   And thank you for the kind words.

        Everybody knows, that the mullahs have got to go.Does that mean war to “topple” the regime? Probably not.The people of Iran could easily clean out the mullahs if they had a little help getting a few of them organized and armed. That’s what needs to happen – it would be better for them, and better for us. It would *not* be better for Blackrock and the big bankers. And that’s the real problem we need to solve. How to cripple our own forever-war machine.Very doubtful that Iran will close off Hormuz, because that would hurt Iran and China more than anyone else.The mullahs have got to go. Somebody inside the Trump admin is working on that as we speak – bet on it.Trump is near-certain to succeed on working with Putin to end the Ukraine war too. Russia will end up in control there, as it should be. NATO should be collapsed, and left to die on its own. Rooting China out of America is the next big job, and the better Trump can do that, the more prosperous and strong we will be.I’m ready to vote him in for a 3rd term!

            Who gives a shit about the Mullahs? That is their problem not ours. If you are so concerned about it I suggest you get on a plane and fly to Iran. Maybe pass out some leaflets or something. Let them know you are unhappy with the way they govern their society.

                It seems the Iranian people were able to rise up under the “dreaded Shah” and dispose of him and change their government from a monarchy to a theocracy. They should be able to do the same again—if they are so willing. That it has not happened might lend a reasonable person to believe they are not willing. If so, why are we to be involved?

I mean, we live in a country where Congress has an approval rating in single digits yet 90% win re-election every year and we are told that all disapproval of the government is due to bots and Russian misinformation.

                        Yep, what to believe in a “world of lies”.This is the essence of my attempted general understanding of today’s world.  Information received is most automatically assumed to have a high probability of being simply a lie, or more generously, a supposition not supported by known facts. So my “go to” is always to use skepticism and logic to see through this “fog”.Example, Trump says we’ve eliminated Iran’s nuke program—“mission accomplished!”  I think, really?  The main site in question was not attacked for days after threat and visible enemy movement to gear up to attack it. So the Iranian government just stood by and let it be attacked—or did they disperse their nuke program and materials in question?  I’m sure this is no great revelation to this group.To paraphrase from an old TV show, “The X-Files”, “The truth is out there…”, you just need to be smart enough to see it.

            Abbe Faria: “Rooting China out of America is the next big job”.
Could we slow down a little bit, and first rid America of the Mexicans?
Then rid America of the kneegrowz?
Then rid America of the j00z?
[Maybe not necessarily in that order…]
PS: Probably wanna put the expulsion of the Pajeets up near the top of the list.
[Northern North America, up in Canuckland, is rapidly becoming Pajeet West.]

For better or worse, they are part of heritage America. They stay in my way of thinking of things. It’s not their fault that a bunch of dumbass farmers were too lazy to do their own work and brought them over.

                    When I was a youngster I was told that the “kneegrows” (lol!) got their white European surnames from interbreeding with their rapist slave-owners and drivers. Imagine my surprise when I later got curious about the story and learned the truth of the matter through independent reasearch of original source materials. I was told another fairy tale similar to yours about the lazy sonsabitches who brought the kneegrows over to do all their work, but curiosity got the best of me on that one later on too, and wouldn’t you know I discovered that’s another lie straight from the depths of hell.In any case they’re definitely not Heritage Americans. The vast majority of them would consider your calling them such an insult of the highest order.

                        Yes, they were lazy. By definition, buying flesh to do your work for you is laziness. They were lazy and since we’ve been talking about second order consequences, also not smart enough to think it through. Your great, great, great, great granddaddies brought them here and now we’re stuck with them.

                        Both things can be true. For most blacks, their heritage in the USA goes back further than it does for many Whites. That said, you’re right, they would not consider themselves Heritage Americans, in fact they hate this country and want no part of it, hence their embrace of things like “the Black National Anthem” (the existence of a “black national anthem” implies the existence of a “black nation”, separate from the USA).So how do you untie this knot, I have no idea. We have a political base that has been drawing power from this contradiction since the 14th Amendment and as such it has never been solved or discussed honestly and openly.

            Yes, the people of Iran have a sincere desire for western degeneracy just like the people of Afghanistan did.

I don’t care about “human rights” or whatever excuse we use to cause trouble in the world. I’m just so sick of it.We need to sweep behind our own back door step before we take our broom elsewhere. We have at least 60 million illegals in this country who need to be rounded up and shipped back to their country of origin. We have state governments (California, I’m looking at you) in open rebellion.We have much bigger fish to fry here, but instead, our politicians are so obedient to AIPAC and our attention is focused on a war that isn’t our fight.
