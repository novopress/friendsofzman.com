        In looking up information for a conversation elsewhere, I happened across the Wikipedia entry for famous and thankfully deceased leftist activist Barbara Ehrenreich.It mentions that she was born in Butte Montana in 1941. She reminisces,“As a little girl”, she told The New York Times in 1993, “I would go to school and have to decide if my parents were the evil people they were talking about, part of the Red Menace we read about in the Weekly Reader, just because my mother was a liberal Democrat who would always talk about racial injustice.”Now, Wikipedia informs us that in 1993, Montana was 0.3% black. No doubt in 1941 it had far fewer blacks even than that. So imagine Ehrenreich’s mother “always” talking about racial injustice when in her day-to-day life, she encountered zero actual blacks.And she managed to raise a daughter who devoted her entire life to making the world worse for ordinary people in the name of “racial justice.”Oh, and yes, Babs, your parents were the evil people.

            Barbara Ehrenreich is dead? Thank God! I didn’t know that. You’ve brightened my afternoon. A human bedsore if there ever was one.

        People have tired of the empty moralism and religious fanaticism, though. Karen was the priestesshood of progressive evangelism, and now everyone hates Karen. Mass media makes this decline difficult to appreciate fully since it is one of the holy temples of progressivism and still observes the rituals. Additionally, Peak Karen very much was a white thing, and God knows that has to be snuffed out even though it aligns with the deification of diversity. The affluence that allowed the madness also is receding, so, increasingly:
IN THIS HOMEWE DON’T CARE.

            “Mass media makes this decline difficult to appreciate fully since it is one of the holy temples of progressivism and still observes the rituals.”
Mass media has been atomized. They can’t control the message or create a critical mass following anymore. It’s very rare that they can create a cultural phenomenon like Friends, Ghostbusters or Seinfeld anymore. That’s actually a very good thing.

        There’s famous heat-map graph that showed in-group vs.out-group preferences for various items. In the middle of the circle was direct family, followed by relatives, followed by community, all the way out to plants and rocks on the outermost circle.
To the surprise of no-one here, the progressives supported rocks before direct family. Of course, they don’t really believe that, but they know how to signal their virtue in our inverted moral framework. And while they don’t follow the morality themselves, they are more than happy to force others to follow it.

            There is recent viral example of this fairly recently with the women meeting a bear or man in the woods and all the crazed fembots choosing bear.  Not a one of these women actually thinks meeting a bear in the woods is preferable to meeting a man in the woods, but they still said it.
We live in an age of stating obvious lies as if they were self-evident truths.  “Diversity is our strength”  Nobody believes this.  Trans women are women.  Even fewer people actually believe this.

                Yep. Obvious media lies also are voraciously consumed because these same types enjoy the falsehoods. It is a post-truth era, which is a product of abundance and affluence.

                    In a post-truth era, an 11-year old has a right to sex-altering chemicals and surgery, on demand and without parental consent. If said 11-year old wants to buy cigarettes, well, what can you expect from a stupid kid? No, Johnny, you can’t smoke cigarettes because they are bad for you and evil tobacco companies want to kill you. Yes, Johnny, we will cut off your sex organs and fill you with estrogen, because it is “who you are.”
Yes, I would call that a paradox.

                    Distortions in the media are nothing new. The media, hamstrung by the need to relay at least some truth in its product mix, must be eagerly awaiting the day when pundits can be used as “reliable sources” and the snake can devour its own tail.

                    The reality, though, is that unlike the liberal integrationists, the Klan actually had to live with blacks, and knew exactly what they were like (instead of reading fictious accounts of blacks by the likes of Harriet Beecher Stowe).
Hence, they took steps to defend themselves, while the author of Uncle Tom’s Cabin lived in Maine and Connecticut…

                        Absolutely. The Pointy Hat Guys wanted Commonsense Negro Control because they quite well understood the consequences of letting them loose because they had to live among the Negroes (often as a minority) in the old Cotton Belt.  That’s where I disagree with the “demographics is destiny” doomsayers. White Southerners were a demographic minority in many areas of the Old Confederacy and maintained their power by a will to rule from the 1680s to 1965.

        -“If the point of America is to impose a new moral order on the world, then it must follow that the point of being an American is to dedicate your life to that cause.”I could never figure out why so many Americans not only dedicated, but lost their lives for “that cause” starting in 1917 when Woodrow Wilson went on a crusade to “make the world safe for democracy” and to “redeem the world” by sending two million troops to another continent to fight a nation that never attacked us.The only explanation I can come up with is that the U.S. became an evangelical, crusading empire in the 20th century and the state religion of “democracy” and “equality” (enforced at gunpoint on both domestic and foreign populations) superseded the Protestant Christianity that defined it in the 18th and 19th centuries.To be sure, the government conscripted soldiers and imprisoned opponents of the war like Debs. But the fact is that during nearly all of the 20th century the vast majority of the population went along with it willingly. The social pressure of war fanaticism was basically like the social pressure to wear a mask during the covid fanaticism. Yes, “the law” was backing it up but nearly everyone became a willing enforcer of the law and ratted out or shamed dissenters.Alvin York started out as a hardcore, Bible-thumping Christian pacifist and conscientious objector, and ended up going to Europe and singlehandedly killing 28 Germans who never attacked his country or his state of Tennessee. WTF.How did the Wilson government manage to abandon 130 years of the Monroe Doctrine get the population to go along with his crusade? The only answer is that it became a new religion, the catechism of which was articulated two decades later by his disciple FDR in the “Four Freedoms” speech.It is ironic how many white, “conservative” Americans disdain the Muslims for being religious absolutists willing to kill infidels to spread their religion, when we are essentially the same. Of course, now our moral crusade includes not simply “democracy” and “equality” but feminism, abortion, homosexuality and miscegenation.It’s hard not to root for “the enemy” these days.

            It wouldn’t surprise me if a sign reading “In this house we believe…” followed by the ten commandments, would be declared a micro-aggression (or worse, hate speech, or worse still, rayciss) and quickly banned in many jurisdictions across the fruited plain.

            True. Other revelatory behavior is Republicans demanding women continue to be excluded from draft registration. Whenever the progressives’ many ideological contradictions threaten to get them into a political bind, the Republicans can be counted on to come and bail them out. It’s still unclear where trans women fit into this discussion, but you can be pretty sure Republican Congress-critters won’t be bringing the question up.

        On the representation front, one of the greatest sources of mirth has been watching the Jumanji Bowman drama play out.  The local progressive wine ladies on the Westchester side of the border funded and got him elected and were so proud and self congratulatory that they had elected a “strong black man”…signs all over yards, fundraisers at the local clubs.  Much of that vanguard was Jewish.  Then….he goes off the leash on Israel and you could almost hear the collective “oh shit”.  So they trundle out the old white guy, Latimer and give him a butt-load of money to make the bad black man go away.  All the yards that had Bowman signs last two cycles, now sport Latimer signs.  Only saw two poor lonesome Bowman yard signs on train station property.  Utterly hilarious.

            My folks live in Westchester and what a difference forty years makes. This is the county that voted twice for Reagan and once for Bush The Elder, only to turn hard left and voted twice for barry, only to have him try to flood the county with Section 8 housing.Yet they still voted for pedo joe twice.my father was at the local coffee shop last week and someone from Bowmans camp was there trying to drum up support.My father is a registered independent (I’m not sure if the GOP is even fielding a candidate in this district) and when the campaign worker tried to make her pitch to him and his friends he was with, my father told her that he’d like to see someone with a modicum of maturity get elected to the seat. According to him, this female got a bit miffed at his response (fair warning, this female was your typical ghetto black, but then again everyone here pretty much knew that.) she asked him how he could make such an assertion and he told me he said, “Pulling a fire alarm to delay a vote smacks of immaturity, kind of like calling in a bomb threat at the local high school to delay a final exam, wouldn’t you agree?” He told me that her eyes bugged out like Buckwheat and she stormed away. He told me he was about to call out, “Wait, aren’t you going to call me a racists?” But thought better of it.Westchester used to be a great county, but during the crack epidemic, a large number of the usual suspects moved into it, fleeing the violence of the city. Those numbers only swelled after 9/11 and again after the Kung Flu showed up. Now the county is truly divided into two camps: the ultra wealthy and the poor. Illegals have flooded many of these areas as well. When I was a kid there were only two instances of violence that I could recall: the first was when I was around eight and us kids were warned of a police impersonator attempting to lure kids to his vehicle. The second was when I was a senior and a dismembered body was found across the street from Harrison High School. We found out that it was a mob hit and that’s where they decided to dump the remains.

                Hmm, “Westchester?”I am not aware of too much in the way of low income housing in the likes of Chappaqua, Katonah, or Bedford. Not to mention Pound Ridge and North Salem.Plenty of celebs, the Clintoons, and their disgusting ilk– and from my interactions plenty of those guys that are employed in private equity, law(fare) skels including patent trolls, various finance types, basically those enjoying the fruits of the ‘new economy’ where no dirty jobs are held. Fingernails never meet dirt.There’s two “Westchesters” so even in one of the highest incoming counties in the USA, you find cloud and dirt people and the twain rarely meet. Best tell dad to keep mouth shut before some calls in a ‘red flag’ check on him.

                    Rest assured it is there, even in Chappaqua where her highness lives. You can see it from the parkway at the Chappaqua Train Station. They built it there specifically because they didn’t want it spread all over town like barry’s people tried to do in Rye where Barbara Bush’s family is from. They are all in one spot, making it easier to keep an eye on them.It’s the same thing with Bedford and North Salem, a select number of condos in existing housing have been quietly set aside for the “disadvantaged”.

            The concept of “making right” has been in our law for a long time, since before we have had written laws in many cases. Once group of people causes harm to another group and so the former must make amends to the latter. The thing is, reparations are an end to the complaint. Everyone knows that giving blacks more money will just mean more demands and more ingratitude. That is the main objection. If reparations meant a reversal of the civil rights revolution, most white people would take the deal.

                There are reparations (a one-time thing) and there is tribute.  We’ve been paying tribute for decades ever since the welfare state was built.  Reparations are just a more blatant form of tribute.  The medievel French found out that paying more tribute just gets you more Vikings making more threats.

                    So, if one thinks this through – true, part of the strategy of psychic survival in AINO is never, ever thinking things through, but still – miscegenation really complicates things. Imagine Obama’s mother (a) still alive and consequently (b) owing her own son a reparations check? But wait, Barry Soetero is half-white, tainted with the demon seed; must he pay the Danegeld out of one pocket, only to switch it to his other pocket?Or does a more disturbing fate await our ex-president?It’s a real question, and the gang at a certain conference in 1942 worked out the limitations and definitions of certain identities and so forth. By their definitions, well, sorry Barry, you don’t make the cut…

                Here’s my reparations scheme, and I would gladly sell off a chunk of my portfolio to make it happen:Remove all non-negroes from the states of Mississippi and Alabama, compensating them for loss of all property they could not take with them.Give every negro in AINO, man, woman and child, 250K.Settle every negro, man, woman and child, in Missibama.Grant Missibama absolute sovereignty and formal nation-state status.Build a wall around Missibama and forbid negro immigration, in perpetuity, from anywhere on the planet, into AINO.Obviously, and for obvious reasons, this will never happen. It will never even be broached at high levels. But if there were an absolutely secret referendum for non-negroes on this proposal, my guess is it would pass 70/30.

                    Eric Hoffer recommended a very similar program in the 1970s.* His view was that blacks lacked pride, and needed an opportunity to build a society of their own, on suitable ground.Not sure about the walls; don’t think he went that far. But it tells us how far we have fallen since 1976 that a respected public intellectual like Hoffer could think and write these things, not as a “rayciss” but sympathetically:give these people a real chance to do build something, and if they blow it, well...*If you can find a copy of Hoffer’s 1976 collection of short essaysIn Our Time, I am pretty sure it is there. For whatever reason I can’t lay my hands on my copy, so I can’t confirm exactly.

                        Hoffer was a kindly soul. I, on the other hand, am under no illusions as to what would become of Missibama. This erstwhile Wakanda would resemble Haiti in relatively short order.

                There was a recent debate between Dave Green and some British guy who has no business weighing in on reparations. The fact that the British are dumb enough to take the bait and weigh in at all tells you have screwed we are. The Brit proposed offering reparations in exchange for getting rid of civil rights as a way to get into the conversation and then retract reparations later. That is not how you negotiate. Green pointed out an even worse part of that approach. Namely, that you promise something now in exchange for something later is a guarantee to lose.At this point, it isn’t clear you could get rid of the CRA since every company and many employees of these companies are, “committed to diversity.”The CRA and affirmative action being scrapped would require a fully organized white solidarity and coordinated mass action. With Trump proposing his Green Card amnesty in exchange for an associate degree, the hour grows later. The next phase is not just importing H1bs, but foregoing the H1b and just directly importing middle and upper middle class scabs to not just get that green card, but to be fully indoctrinated in anti-white and anti-American hatred at the credentialing institution.Trump is dumb ass. With champions like that … …

            I thought the same thing reading that line.  But, there is one example I can think of when it comes to reparations.  The Japanese who were round up and all their money/stuff taken and thrown in concentration camps during the war.  We did give reparations to them, I believe, right around the turn of the  century.But the thing is, they were not the children or grand children.  It was the actual people who experienced the loss.  With blacks, it’s the great-great-great grandchildren demanding reparations from the great-great-great grandchildren of the Whites who supposedly harmed their great-great-great grandparents.Even if reparations were the right thing and totally moral, the numbers involved are so astronomical there is no chance we could ever pay them.  How can you compensate someone for being a slave their entire lives?  We give the “wrongfully convicted” many millions of Dollars for something well less than life.  Then they make it worse by pretending the descendants are no better off because of slavery.  Nobody ever says “what’s a million times 40 million” in their reparation studies because to do the math answers the question about reparations.

                    Or to the modern school system.. or the projects.. the welfare state… mandatory discrimination against White people/affirmative action.Not to mention the descendants of slaves grew up in America and were vastly richer than their African counterparts.  Of course, no adjustments would ever be made on account of this or the near century of gibs.Like I said in my earlier comment, even if reparations were justified and the century of gibs and black special privileges never happened, even the paltry sum of a million dollars each would cost 40 trillion Dollars. Nothing less than a million would ever do.  Even if we had 40 trillion laying around or spread it over 10 years or something, it would only harm them.  We need only study lottery winners to know large of sums of money to poor people almost always harms them.  The well to do blacks, who are already massively benefiting from living in America are the only people who would really benefit.  This scheme, were it to happen, would go on in perpetuity.  Every new black baby born would have a reparations account.Worst part, reparations is going to happen.  It will probably be a token amount which will not satisfy anyone.  The blacks will be pissed that it’s too small and everyone paying the bill will be pissed that they don’t get it and that their taxes have gone up.  After the blacks it will be the Indians. After the Indians it will be Mexicans.

                The Act finally passed in 1988.  The difference as noted was that those folk wronged were given funds.  They were wronged by a “national” war-time act at the behest of the entire country via the president at the time.  Until that time, there were no programs to redress harms done to Japanese Americans then affected.Slavery of course is another story.  Reparations can never come from those who owned slaves to those who were slaves—and such will be on top of trillions of dollars spent in attempts over decades to ameliorate the (supposed) harms of slavery upon the Black race, who ever those are these days given race mixing and immigration over 150 years.The answer to the above question is most often a call for even more special privileges to be awarded Blacks in perpetuity such as free college tuition, exemption from taxation, and the like.  Personally, I say let it happen.  This country only seems to react when faced with such audacious overreach.  I say everyone who files a tax return should have a special tax added at the bottom of the form indicating their “fair” share of reparations.

The real victims are long gone.And victims of what, really? You mean this long-standing tradition in human life calledconquest?The Iroquois tribes would have known all about that. Their descendants?

        Collectively the morality of reparations is somewhat justifiablePerhaps eons ago that may have had some weight to it.But who here can honestly say that blacks have not been given everything under the sun and more?Access to white civilization, the very thing that they cannot even maintain, let alone create themselves, must surely be the biggest ‘reparation’ of all. If there was any time for monetary reparations to be paid directly to blacks, presumably it would have been at, or shortly after, the time of their freeing? Perhaps that was done, I don’t know.Add in the compleat humiliation (i.e., whites washing feet of blacks to absolve themselves and their ancestors) of whites, and you’ve got all the ‘reparation’ one may need.Your problem of the individual nature of these reparations scheme is no doubt true, but I feel that to lendanycredibility to the Left’s drives for reparations; to cede any moral ground on the matter, is to begin on a path of error.

            The only condition under which reparations should be considered is if they include a mandatory, permanent relocation across the Atlantic to the place from where they originated.  If they are not willing to accept such a deal, then they admit they have received sufficient reparation.
Even if such reparations are not strictly due, it is likely worth it.

            The, IMO, classic college-newspaper ad from David Horowitz made this point, that American Blacks live the best of blacks anywhere in the world, whether descended from slavery or not. If there is a good lib retort to that, I haven’t heard it– you need to really believe in the lawyerly theory of reality to find demonstrable damages generations on. Even so, they muddle the legal and spiritual meanings of damages, because in truth neither approach is, uh, seaworthy.I think the reparations window has passed, i.e. it’s all over but the shouting. The immigration of African blacks in the 21st century quickly surpassed the number of foreigners of any race ever sold here as slaves. So it lacks the ethnic movement discipline of an Indian casino revenue dispute, for example.

        The kind on nonsense described in today’s post is yet another example of way too many people having way too much idle time on their hands while possessing a guilty conscience about living the easy life at the expense of other’s labor. Of course I’m describing the political class and it’s coterie of government apparatchiks. They and their lobbyists pimps endlessly write new rules and regulations in order to justify getting a fraudulent paycheck. That is, by definition, what a parasite does. It’s only skill is feeding off the productivity of others. This will continue until scarcity returns and being a parasite is no longer a successful survival strategy. You do not want to be parasite when the plates stop spinning.

            You can only have a guilty conscience if you’ve led a soft life. Anyone who’s actuallysufferedin his life can take attempts at triggering guilt and shove them where the sun don’t shine. Besides which, it says something about your intrinsic mindset if you specialize in prompting guilt in others. Unencumbered by any sense of shame, and high on your own sense of self, one equates one’s moral standing with one’s ability to browbeat other men into following one’s social instructions …— Sorcerygod (www.dark.sport.blog)

        “A solitary white man has a right to associate with whom he chooses but get enough white guys together and at some point, they lose their individual rights in favor of group responsibility.”Sounds like my group of childhood friends (culturally conservative, even if they didn’t know it) in their late 20s when one of them decided to start bringing his black roommate — and later good friend — to our little in-group reunions. One night somebody had too many and said — out of hearing of most, but not all — “why’s that guyalwayshere now?”End of individual rights, end of group.You don’t talk about my black friend that way…It has always seemed to me that white conservatives in the US have a similar dynamic, only expressed at the molecular level, when one of the fellas finds out a black guy at work is a member of the NRA or thinks “the Dems” are “hypocrites.” Men who stop making friends at 25 will fall over backwards to befriend the guy, and we all know why.

        I don’t know at what point in time it was determined by someone or a group of someones that the point of America was to impose a new moral order on the world, but it was always bulls*** and in any case has been total failure.  I believe it was Washington who warned against getting involved in foreign affairs and to basically mind our own damned business.  I used to believe that America always stood for right and standing up against various bullies.  But just like kids who eventually come to realize there’s no Santa Claus, this place sure as hell is no shining city on the hill – that just a childlike fantasy we were told that never had any basis in reality.

            The “when” is debatable. What is not, however, is that directly America won the Cold War it went full-blown Our Democracy on the whole bleedin’ planet. America interpreted this victory as absolute validation of its moral system and sanction to embark upon the global crusade which it is still, and with increasing zealotry, engaged.

        There is no paradox. “I demand free speech according to your principles, I deny your free speech according to mine.” Same thing with racial/sexual inclusiveness or the lack thereof. The favored groups must be included, the disfavored groups either excluded or forced to accept the favored ones. And forced to pay for them. It is not paradoxical because it only works in one direction, pro-mud, pro girl power, anti white male. See the victim hierarchy for the finer points of how it works. At the top of the hierarchy is the 6 million. Not even an ipsogender congolese furry empowerment refugee is allowed to question that.

        There’s also the paradox that the only way to treat a person of another race as an individual in social and economic relations is if you have strict community boundaries based on race.
In Japan, they can treat a visiting African as an individual because they know that he must leave at some point and is not part of an invasion of Africans.

            Eh, yeah, but it’s simpler than that – you’re not Japanese, you’re foreign (ethnic Japanese don’t necessarily count). The paradox of that is the Japanese love their archetypes and things having their place. If you’re a foreigner, say a black guy who found a function to fill, say some sort of niche that fits you, you get upgraded from a tourist to a cog in the machine that’s probably not required and wouldn’t be missed if it broke, but a cog that fits. It’s been my experience anyway (I’m not black but foreigners who perminently reside in Japan with any success understand there’s that metaphorical bootbon tour neck to behave).

            Your post reminded me of the latest, and I think greatest yet, victory in “our” war against Japan.Japan’s cities have recently been plagued by black foreigners making YouTube prank videos that typically involve doing sudden violence to Japanese people, who are dispositionally “relaxed” and react with greater fear and shock than those of us who know better. Johnny Somali—famously Israeli-managed “content creator”—was the case that made the news, but he was just one of dozens. A general word went out among blacks that Japan was the place to do this, and there was a prank-video land rush.This Jew-sponsored black terror campaign inspired a very successful propaganda push, cultivating among the Japanese a new fear/hatred of “tourists”—white people. The displacement of anti-immigrant sentiment onto gaijin of pallorcoincidedwith news that the Japanese government has decided to replace its people with Indians.Well played.

        “At some point, there are a number of individuals that flip from judging them as individuals to judging them as a group.”In the end, the only “right” the Progressive Left recognizes—indeed requires—is *hypocrisy*!  Take an example from the recent culture wars, trannies.  Particularly tranny “right” to participate in cross sex activities.I’ve heard any number of interviews/discussions now with either trannies or their Leftist supporters discussing why these delusional misfits must be allowed to not only participate in women’s sport activities, but shower with women and use their locker rooms to change in.  It’s their (tranny’s) “right” of course to be recognized as women and your requirement to pretend they are such and treat them as such.However, when the interviewer turns the argument around and discusses the overwhelming number of “normal” women who object to participating in this mental delusion and their rights (group rights), the Leftist is happy to refer to individual rights and ignore the group rights of the overwhelming majority.I have no problem with today’s missive from Z-man, but think it’s a “fool’s errand” to subscribe any kind of sanity, or logic, or rule based process to Progressive Leftism.  Insanity is just that, insanity—unreasoning, emotive, contradictory.  This is why, in a previous age, we isolated those people from society, influence, and above all—power.

            In the social sciences and humanities–and certainly in my field of history–that “isolation” was called “marginalization” and it was condemned by scholars out of hand. When I was in grad school, and before I became DR, I supported the condemnation. The recognition that certain groups of people SHOULD be marginalized signifies one is a member of the DR. It is a hallmark.

Multiracial, liberal democracy is set of luxury beliefs that, ironically, only a homogenuous White population can afford. It doesn’t matter how deranged your professed outward beliefs are when you and everyone around you work, act, and behave like your grandparents did in 1955. It’s trivial to open up your club/group to all when the only people who would realistically join it are all White because that’s the only people within a day’s drive of it.

            Imagine a non-ideological, results-oriented republican rightist (lol) doing a little nooooticing and deciding that the vote should be restricted to citizens whodon’tpay federal income tax. I’d bet that, honestly calculated, government employees and contractors are the majority of “taxpayers.” Their “paying” is a grotesque ceremonial display—accountancy potlatch?—but maybe there’s a non-obvious wisdom in it. Progressivism may be a feeling of not only identification with but material investment in the regime. Maybethat’swhy there are no poor communists (or leftists of any kind, really).

        More important than the collective-versus-individual antinomy is the fact that its strictures are worked only against whites. Does the power structure lower the boom on negroes for forming formal groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus? Does it censor Black Entertainment Television? Does it send in the goon squad to disperse black college graduation ceremonies?Rhetorical questions all. And the same questions could be asked of other groups–pervs, Finkels, Sand Hutus, etc.–with basically the same answer being correct. What this means is that anti-white racism (and pro-minority chauvinism), not erosion of individual rights, is prime here. These group dynamics are telltale signs of today’s postmodern fascist western states.

            This will require an absurd amount of infrastructure that we simply do not have anymore. Regardless of the power of data, there still needs to be people on the ground to verify what is real on the internet is actually real. CBDC’s will just accelerate “Dead Internet”, where nothing is real anymore.
It will also create all sorts of hilarious workarounds, like charging 300 dollars for a pen, but the farmer will tack on a hundred pounds of beef as an incentive.

        @VizziniEvery country has a law so it has to allow things and forbid things. It will allow things that are considered good and forbid things that are considered evil. So the law must be based on an ideology that distinguishes good from evil. And this is the definition of a religion. Therefore, each country is a theocracy.If you feel that a country (say America during the 50s or the 80s) is not a theocracy is because you share the religion, so you don’t feel that your freedom is limited by the State because the things you are forbidden to do are the things you don’t want to do. So you feel free. A woke person feels the same in our current theocracy. A Muslim feels free in Saudi Arabia.The problem is that you don’t share the official religion so you feel the limitations to your freedom, but there are always limitations.As always, we cannot reason outside Rousseau’s tenets. The problem is not a country being a theocracy. The problem is being a theocracy based on an evil religion. Evil religions are the ones not based on the natural law (being the natural law the minimum set of laws needed for a society to survive long-term). So, for example, “don’t castrate your kids” is part of the natural law. A society based on a religion that includes that is good. A society based on a religion that rejects that is evil. So there are good theocracies and evil theocracies and talk about theocracy is a red herring.

        Do theocracies really have a bad track record, though? Prior to well into the enlightenment era (and beyond), there were approximately zero Western governments that were not in some form theocracies. Perhaps they were not literally run by the priests, but they had official state religions from which societal morality flowed, and the rulers ruled by divine justification. Indeed, the rulers were often the titular heads of the Churches (as is still technically the case in the UK). Many of those lasted thousands of years.The difference with these modern “secular theocracies” is that there is no authority for their moral laws beyond the state. Of course they are fragile.

        Let me add, that the Ruling elite has an easy solution to the problem of holiness among the people conflicting with getting things done.
Outsourcing.
The Stellantis CEO Tavares is gutting the engineering group in Chrysler and outsourcing it to Morocco and Turkey. Being non-White they are of course immune to any immoral thoughts or deeds. Bonus — firing White guys.
Just food for thought.

        The Rage Against White Guy is very, very female and upper class White:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZQi2faUI4No, you really have to see this. Upper Class White women dropping thousands to scream in the forest.And the Rage Rituals and emphasis on female holiness is running right up against Vladmir and Xi. Just this weekend Ukraine shot an ATACMS missile onto a Crimean Beach with cluster munitions killing a bunch of people including kids. And the CIA / ISIS (same thing) ran amok in Dagestan murdering an Orthodox Priest during service and burning a synagoge. [In West LA over the Weekend, a bunch of Hamas people attacked a synagoge during services, with the cops basically standing by doing nothing.]All that Upper Class Female Rage Rituals depend ultimately on them controlling men to enforce their will. How good a matriarchy is in enforcing its will is an open question. “Draft Our Daughters” might sound good to Hill-Dog, but it is sure to help kick off extra spiceyness. As well as Extra Crispy.

        “Theocracies have a poor history primarily because men are not angels. “Yes, because the Ancient Egyptian empire lasted only about 3000 years and Eastern Orthodox Byzantium only 1000 years…My sarcastic (!) point is that societies ruled by a single religion have (on the contrary) not a “poor” but an “excellent” history; having been the most enduring in history; not least because these were pretty much the *only* civilizations until 1917.However (Russia aside) I agree with your implicit point that from here and now in The West theocracy won’t happen, and would not work if tried.From where we are the building of a religious society needs to be bottom-up – not top-down.But, because non-religious societies are clearly not just dysfunctional but actively suicidal; this means that civilization will almost certainly collapse before anything can be done to reform them (not least because – as you described last week – of suicidally sub-fertile reproductive rates in All secular and developed societies) – and we are actually discussing what *might* (if mankind is fortunate) arise afterwards.

                Not likely because “we” is too nebulous and diverse a group already. Even assuming you’re strictly referring to Nordic and WASP whites, the divide within that still diverse group is split fairly evenly.

                I don’t know of another dangerous personage is on the ‘name of Moses shall be stricken from every obelisk’ list here, but the blogger that goes by Rollo Tomassi has a video on the obvious —https://www.youtube.com/live/kjn4PAKdgwM?Why would TPTB want to push all the attention on a certain faith that HAS lasted 2,000+ years? Normies think ‘pedo’ they think ‘clergy’ not school teacher — specifically whyte, female teacher.What a win! Lawyers soak the employer of the clergy, get rich while attacking their enemy of millenia …. so perhaps a religion can last, although the vast majority of Protestant churches have certain flags planted on them, signaling defeat.

        Theocracies have a poor history… At some point, practical necessity requires the people to overthrow the priests.
Isn’t it actually rather commonplace, historically speaking, for the king to also be the high priest or vice-versa?

        Judas priest is this a tour de force. Magnificent. This is real philosophy.
Long ago the Zman said, “aggregates cannot be judged by the same standards as individuals, they are not the same.”  At that time, I was thinking that everyone spoke in terms of individuals, but no one seemed to define group dynamics.
I’d say this small piece goes light-years in definition, simplicity, and clarity.
In supplication, let me add another definition.Why are women the moral enforcers of any society?Because, in all of nature, it is the female that says Yes, or No.

        I don’t think it’s quite a Sorites Paradox, it’s a reclassification under a regulated category that causes the problem. I’m pretty certain that, even in this day and age, you could form a “European Club” and, as long as you kept it a strictly private affair, there is nothing the authorities could or would do about it, no matter how large it became.The problem arises when you try to obtain public recognition for what you are doing. If you incorporate as a business or a nonprofit, then you become regulated by the Chamber of Commerce and the IRS. If you establish yourself as a landlord for tax purposes, then you become regulated by the Federal Fair Housing Act, so on and so forth.The affronts to the freedom of association are enforced through the regulation of institutions that attempt to gain official recognition from the state. This implies that the corrective action is either to reform the state or just ignore it, since edicts like this are unconstitutional anyway. If enough people started ignoring these laws they would quickly become unenforceable. Yes, a few pioneers would take some arrows, but the battle would be won.

                Correct.  As Zman has noted, libertarianism is useless because it is not serious about the use of force.  A gun beats a principled argument every time.

                Because your comment is not factually correct.  You still believe there is a constitution, and you have rights the government cannot work around.  Go ask the Proud Boys about that.  The FBI will plant members in your little white club, have them instigate violence somewhere, and then arrest and frame whoever they want.  Hell, they might even form the group in the first place to suck in the non-compliant, like the Gretchen Witchmer episode. It’s pretty hard to take some arrows and win the battle, when you can’t trust the guy next to you.

                What a narcissistic, clueless response.  ID, what’s wrong with you?You were the one who splashed onto the scene sometime back saying the cure for racism was for every White to do “his duty” and marry a minority and end racism through miscegenation (IIRC).Did you ever think you might perhaps be posting in the wrong group?  Certainly, you comments wrt Z-man and this group over at the Unz Review would seem to indicate your continuing dislike for this blog and its commenters—yet you continue to return to post in spite of your unfavorable reception.Doing the same thing over and over, while expecting different results, is one working definition of insanity.

            This comment is based on the assumption that people still have rights enshrined in the Constitution, with a government dedicated to protecting those rights. This is absolutely not the case anymore. Your European club will get infiltrated by glowies once it gets to a certain size and the size is much smaller than you think. It’s happened over and over, you can’t possibly be this naive. People of European descent don’t have any rights anymore. The government doesn’t respect your privacy, why would they respect your private group?This isn’t meant to be a blackpill, but more just as acknowledgement of what the reality of the situation is.

            State recognition destroys foundationally white groups alright. If the state recognizes (in the sense of discovers) the group, it will destroy it. In other words, explicity white groups can survive only when sub rosa. And if, ipso facto, your right of association can endure only in absolute darkness, you have no right to associate at all.
