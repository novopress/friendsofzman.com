        I keep hoping that some Golden Boy, and I can’t even think of anyone, will come riding out of the prairie on a mighty steed, and will steal our hearts, and we’ll be saved.  A man can dream, can’t he?

        Logical. Probably accurate. But. There is a lot of…hatred?…within the conservative to right-wing electorate toward ruling Republicans. People are increasingly aware that they have been trapped in a fixed political show, and although there is no one on your list to actually shake things up that doesn’t mean the opportunity is not out there and ripe for the taking.And, anybody named Bush or Clinton is an insult to the illusion of a republic. Do we not like our illusions? This may be a rare case where name recognition is a problem. BTW, a good negative add for the primaries would be, who was Jeb’s lieutenant governor and successor? With a pic.

        I was DC last week. It is another world from the one I live in. Bright eyed young government apparatchiks shopping at stores with insane prices. These folks are determined to hold on to their power and prestige. Hillary, Bush, the fake Indian,Fatty from Jersey, whoever. It’s all about keeping their lifestyles of opulence on our nickel.Ominous signs though in the other DC, streets full of ghetto denizens. How long will they be happy with the crumbs from the master’s table?As Donald Fagan sang:Will you still have a song to singWhen the razor boy comesAnd take your fancy things awayWill you still be singing itOn that cold and windy day

        “He’s out soft peddling his gay marriage position. That’s not going to win him any friends amongst primary voters.”
Curiously, Cruz did the same thing, for which he was praised by Barney Frank.  You are going to see Federalism as the new Righty candidate default position on gay marriage; it gives them a pass with the big donors, who mostly support it.  It will be interesting to see where Huck and Santorum land on the issue.

        Your last paragraph is spot on.  When Cantor went down I predicted the passage of a Border Security bill to mollify the base.  Ted Cruz will co-sponsor the bill in the Senate to give it some credibility with the base.  Sure enough, here’s the new head of the NRSC on CNN yesterday:“I think the first thing we’ll do is a strong border security bill. And frankly, that’s why I think Speaker Boehner didn’t take it up in the House last term is because he didn’t have confidence that the administration would actually enforce the border security part of it. But I think once we do that, we will have a debate in this term of Congress about what to do with those children who came through no decision of their own and what’s the best way to handle that issue. I think we’ll have that debate.”He’s not the only one.  Border security is the new mantra from the usual suspects, including the dread Marco Rubio.  Of course, no one trusts GOP Inc., or the administration to actually follow through, which is why they need The Manchurian Conservative to give the nod.  The price will probably be some access to GOP establishment funding for his inevitable Presidential run.

            The Bush Klan has good relations with the the Evangelical grass roots organizations. I’m not sure Jeb is bright enough to leverage it. W was called a blockhead, but he was just a poor public speaker. Jeb has the gift of gab, but I suspect he may be a bit of a dimwit. He’s out soft peddling his gay marriage position. That’s not going to win him any friends amongst primary voters.I think the GOP is going for the knock-out punch with the Right in 2016. Not only will they nominate a wet like Jeb, he will add another wet as his second. I’m thinking Bush – Fiorino. Having a vagina on the ticket will be important. The governor of New Mexico is another option. An Hispanic vagina would be a home run in the eye of GOP Inc.

        It is sad but true that Bush will garner a huge share of the $ and that will spell the demise of any conservative candidate.  Unless a “hope and change” type personality emerges from the pack we will have at least four more years of Bush to look forward to.  God I hate dynasties.
