        “Politics as professional wrestling is fun for the twenty-somethings who are naturally drawn to it, but in time they will have to have real lives.”I wonder. We are in the Age of permanent adolescence. We run up debts and start fights like teenagers. Grown men play video games all day. Grown women go to Taylor Swift concerts and make TikTok videos. For many, “real lives” will never happen, at least in the way we used to think of them.

            The mothers taking their pre-teen daughters to the Melanie Martinez show in Detroit where interesting. The fans of this current thing dress up as different types of barbie dolls, but more like anime barbie dolls. It is hard to explain, but you can find pics on line. More than a few of the moms were dressed like their kids. Some no doubt did it for one last bit of fun with their daughters before they started dating a black boy, but others seemed to be enjoying it as much as their kids.

                Nah, mom will tag along with the jungle love.  Look at that hideous Kardashian mom.  Once it became clear that all her daughters were mud sharks, and her husband a degenerate freak, she decided to burn the coal too.  It’s how they stay young.

                    How much were the Kardashians paid to be mud sharks, and by whom, is my question. Law of averages says that out of 6 (Kris, Kim, Kourtney, Kloe, Kylie, and Kendal, am I missing anybody?) at least one of them should like white men, but they are batting 1.000 for the negros.

                        I know I’m going to get slammed for this, but at this point I do not evenregard Armenians as White.  I knew none growing up.  I met one in college (and noted she was quite dark) before her family pulled her out due to incipient lesbianism.  I have not worked with any.  But every Armenian name I read about is either associated with leftist politics, blacks, or both (like the one who married Serena Williams.

                            Good observation and one that should not generate more negative votes than positive.  I’d note here, we often speak of light skinned races as “not White”.  Why are Armenians exempt?  The opposite is also true, especially when we speak of Indians from the subcontinent.  I know little about Armenians and their origins to be sure, but to me skin color is not the sine qua non of differentiation between races.

                            Genetically, are Armenians closer to Turks and Mongols or Slavs and Germanics? That’s important. I don’t consider Turks to be white. That said, Armenian Christianity is among the oldest on the planet, and that certainly counts for something.

                                Ostei:  I don’t know about Armenian genetic origins, and would have to do some digging.  I agree Turks are not White, although their upper class (diplomats I knew) is far whiter than the average guy on the street.  Due entirely to all the Slavs and Circassians and Irish etc. taken as slaves.  Fwiw, the average Greek I dealt with was no lighter than the Turks, and a lot less friendly and hospitable.  YMMV.

                                    Remember, a lot of Turkish society is assimilated Greek, Macedonian, Serbian, Bulgarian and wherever else they pulled people from during the Ottoman Empire days.

                                        Also worth noting is that Byzantium was Greek. After the conquest in 1453, I’m certain the Turks mixed a great deal with the indigenous folk.

They were “chosen” (unintentional pun) just like Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg were handed the (((DARPA))) baton. I don’t know anything about DARPA and who runs it, but I find it funny that two of our biggest tech successes were handed off to the chosen. CIA undoubtedly has a huge Jewish influence.

                                        Falcone: oligarchs came after the USSR fall. Armenia became a separate country and their business conditions could not be compaired to Russian.They had a devastating earthquake in 1988 (6.8 magnitude) after which a lot of Armenians emigrated and joine Armenian diaspora in France, Greece and US.A terrible war with Azerbaijan followed and untold number of Armenians became refugees. Probably only less enterprising population was left behind.

                                    So, way more crooked than Jews? Vlachs in the Balkans have the same reputation of being smart and business-oriented. Nikola Tesla was of Vlach origin.My internet curiosity connected some dots and I confirmed from my dad that we are at least part Vlach. (Probably more, based on the latinesque names of some ancestors both sides of my family.) My dad doesn’t want to hear it because they kind of do have the same reputation as Jews, at least being greedy and stuff like that.(Fun fact: The indigenous “Greeks” of the part of Macedonia that ended up in Greece were predominantly of Vlach ancestry and maybe there is some substance to that because of the Greco-Roman thing. When you see a surname like Vlahos, that’s generally what it means.)

                                            And the language they speak is latinesque, but with other influences. Some people say that their ancestry goes back to the Roman Empire. Who knows? But I think that part of Europe from Romania all the way into Constantinople and Greece is what I would call Vlachish. That seems to be the common thread with all the tribes over there and probably related to the Greco-Roman thing as well.The other thing in my readings over the years is that ancestry over there wasn’t necessarily define by bloodline as much as which Orthodox Bishop you fell under. If you were under the Bulgarian Exarchate, you were classified as Bulgarian. If you were under the Greek Patriarchate, you were Greek, etc. Often it came down to which one could offer your village more perks.Just a few little nuances that may or may not be relevant to the discussion here, that I always found interesting.

                                                And that romance language, which eventually morphed into Romanian, was centered in Dacia–roughly coterminous with Romania–of which Wallachia was a region. Given that there is a strong overlap between language and ethnicity, splitting hairs between the language-speakers and the people themselves is introducing a distinction with very little actual difference.

                                Similar to what I say about Ethiopians. We have a decent number in this area and my interactions with them have always been positive. But then again, they adopted Christianity (the Christians being predominantly Oriental Orthodox, I believe) before Europe did.

                                    Yes, Ethiopian Christianity is of great antiquity, but nobody in his right mind would argue Ethiopians are white. You can at least make a case that Armenians are white.

                                        That is true, but they aren’t blackity black either. It’s obvious they’ve either got some light in them or they evolved in the way they did based on geography and climate. Generally speaking, good looking people, great manners and very pleasant. At least the ones I’ve encountered.

They’re not as black as our own blacks, they typically are lighter than even Egyptians. They’ve got a lot of white in them either through through occupation, invasion, natural selection or all of the above.

                            A ton of them in Los Angeles.  Glendale especially.  People from New York, say an older Irishman, will sometimes say “They are like the ginnies” — or the dagos or the guidos.  There is in fact a lot of that to them, or to the men, but obviously they lack the Italian charisma, and their choice of colognes is mideastern in flavor. rather than European.  They also seem to act like New York Italians, but their eyes are more asiatic and everyone jokes about their unibrows, but they have no clue on how to make pizza but they dominate the pizzerias in town.  The real similarity is that they end up in similar lines of work, say salvage yards or recycling or auto shops, and are big into cars.  Big into family.  Somewhat stick to themselves.  And they always have a cousin who is a banker who gets them into an Italian or German sports car, and if you see one in a car that costs less than $100,000 it’s a big deal.The women can be quite beautiful.  For whatever reason, many of them become bank tellers.  So if anyone wants to see them go to a branch bank in Glendale or Burbank or North Hollywood.  They have a somewhat exotic mideastern look but softer doe eyes and not the beady ones that are typical of people from out there.  Their eyes reveal them to be what they are, something of an asiatic people but with a soft pastoral aspect that made them a good fit for the teachings of Jesus Christ.

                            Never known one but reading the news about Amenia now, my impression of them is that they are stupider than Poles and that’s saying something. Add to that the Armenian organized crime gangs, there are a lot of them and are known to be ruthless. They really shouldn’t be considered white.

                                Don’t you think “white” means English?  Not German, not Scandinavian, not slavic, not Italian, not Greek.  I think everyone sort of understands that but lately people are reluctant to say it.  Now I understand why the definition is being broadened, to attract greater numbers because European peoples are under assault, but it’s still a hollow program and a diluted definition of a certain people.   It also ignores ethnic pride of all those millions of non Brits.As I said some years ago, the best bet for the European people is a sort of confederacy based on ethno-religious lines.  Not “white”. That’s stupid.   No one other than a Brit or some other perhaps American Germans wants to be lumped in with Brits and considered “white”.  That’s the problem, and no one in this “space” ever wants to deal with it.  As far as I can tell.

Take care of the JQ and sub-Saharan problem, then we can talk about the finer distinctions between the Anglo and the Saxon.  It’s like worrying about a hang nail when your jugular is bleeding out.

I don’t generally follow this stuff, so someone feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but I thought the father was the one who got involved in black “kultur” and sportsball players before his wife got involved with their wives.  Either way, odious people.

                I’ve heard Melanie Martinez described as “bubblegum goth” which seems about right.  I remember in the 80s hearing Run DMC and thinking this rap thing will be over soon.  Turns out Jimmy Snow was right.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gQV15DPvyE

                The fans of this current thing dress up as different types of barbie dolls, but more like anime barbie dolls. It is hard to explain, but you can find pics on line. More than a few of the moms were dressed like their kids.

            No one should be surprised by the age of perpetual adolescence, the last generation of Americans that actually grew up into elderhood was maybe the Silents, and they are largely dead at this point.From the boomers onward, there has been this mentality that if you just pretend like life’s seasonality doesn’t exist and live like you are 45 into your 70s, you won’t ever have to face winter. That lack of eldership among the population over the last 50 years is bearing the bittrr fruit we all have to eat now. It won’t change until old people start planting trees whose shade they won’t sit under again, either.

                Whoo-hoo-hoo, look who knows so much. It just so happens that the Silents are only MOSTLY dead. There’s a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there’s usually only one thing you can do–go through his clothes and look for loose change.

        There’s always a certain attraction to the willing to say the forbidden truthful stuff about the current regime and the world in general. Nick does it better than most.
The first time I saw Rush Limbaugh (his old tv show) was probably 1993. I was blown away that somebody was saying the things I was thinking about the Clintons.

        One aspect of the internet age is it’s fickleness. A Youtube streamer could be at the top of the world one year and fall to nothingness within a couple years. This is especially true with slaves to the algorithm of mega-tech corporations. Fuentes has been smart enough to build his own source and so is less dependent, but like you said, his brand of political edutainment can get stale very quickly. This isn’t the age of a political columnist who can make the pundit rounds for decades, but an age of very low attention span, and therefore very short stardom.The only way to survive long-term is to build alliances and eventually get funding from sympathetic people who can build infrastructure. Given how Fuentes treated Andrew Torba’s good will back in the day by acting like a total jerk on his site after Torba cut him a big check, I wouldn’t hold my breath.

            I’m agnostic about Little Nicky but there have been some huge red flags. One of the biggest is his own fickleness and lack of loyalty among his cohort. Republicans used to value loyalty above all else…ride or die mentality. Fuentes is ride and jettison mentality. Not unlike Milo.He also seems to turn on things with illogical middle-school abandon…he picked a fight with Steve Sailer and called Auron MacIntyre’s book “goyslop” yet he boosted Ron Unz’s writings. Leaving aside the fact that Unz is a Jew, I don’t understand why you’d be so puerile and catty with fellow rightists. Fuentes is a zero sum guy, possibly a cancer, and for the D-Right to thrive, we need a thousand flowers to bloom.

                        El Segundo’s not bad. I can’t think of a better place with a refinery, a sewage treatment plant for 3 million people and LAX to the north. It’s almost all White and has a coastal LA climate.  Hell, I’ll rent a cardboard box for $800 a month if I can still take a shower at the aquatic center.

                    Except that Nick has managed to stay relevant while Milo burned out sometime in 2017 (right after Bill Maher compared him to Christopher Hitchens, LOL). Though Nick has better charisma and far less oleaginous and icky than Milo.As for Gavin, he’s still around but still manning the alt-lite rampart like a silly middle-aged punk rocker. I have a soft spot for Gavin, though; he is a real person and seems to have got himself wrapped up in something he couldn’t handle. He was one of the first canaries in the coal mine after all, and the Feds went after him and his followers big time. Fuentes seems oddly immune from his shenanigans…maybe he’s an informant as some have suggested.

                        I watch Cumia’s show and enjoy Wednesdays when Gavin is on.  He made some money along the way and has a wife and kids in New York of all places.  So can understand him wanting a lower profile.
He’s still funny and can still take a joke (Anthony calls him Goyvin whenever he defends Jews).  His stories about accidentally starting the Proud Boys because he wanted his intern to man up are very funny.

                To be fair, Unz’s writings are pretty decent if a bit long.   Seems incapable of writing under 10,000 words.  For a Jew to critically question the hollow cost narrative takes some chutzpah. But he does seem genuinely interested in pursuing truth/evidence wherever it leads.

            Yeah, his behavior on Gab was off-putting. Maybe he has grown out of it by now.Edginess can get you started, but it can’t sustain you for the long term.OTOH, Nick has been around for almost a decade. He looks like a baby, but he is a veteran.

        On a related note, over the weekend in Detroit, Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA event was also held, and Nick Fuentes and his friend MMA fighter Jake Shields were turned away at the door by security.  I believe this was because of their criticism of Israel, which is rapidly becoming illegal.
Fuentes is young, so there’s still time for him to learn to love Israel like Charlie Kirk does.

            Z talked about this in his pod! For many of the people at TPUSA, being seen even looking at Nick and Jake for a millisecond too long is an end to their career in the conservative industry, and it’s not like they have any marketable skills outside of it.

                Indeed!  Thanks for mentioning Friday’s podcast, that clinches it.Conservative Inc. is about event planning, meet-n-greets, making connections, playing a role, getting noticed and being seen, finding the deals on offer.
It’s Hollywood!  Pure Hollywood.  Our political system is a self-referencing extrinsic society, every bit as much as a Gene Kelly movie like “Singing in the Rain.”
Bonus: and like those Golden Age Hollywood movies, their ultimate goal is recruiting support for the War effort with the folks at home.

            It shouldn’t be too surprising that the zoomers are adopting a here and now self focus considering the environment they are maturing into.As I write this, the top comment is a boomer style lament about kids these days spending their days playing vidya instead of having “real lives” of consuming the country’s seed corn to purchase Harley Davidsons and go on 5 cruises per year. With how badly the last few generations have abused the nation’s inheritance, a doomsday cult style outlook isn’t that shocking among the zoomies.After all, there is a non-zero chance that the zoomers will be spending the summers of their lives fighting in a Fallout wasteland, might as well play the simulation now for practice.

Think about it, that’s some majorly boomer shit, right there. Boomers had an apocalyptic mindset hammered into them. That’s probably a huge reason why they lived it up.

Regarding Zoomers, what could possibly be moar apocalyptic than being forced to submit to an MRNA v@xxine designed to sterilize and/or murder you?
The V@xxpocalypse is the greatest threat to the survival of Our Race since the eruption of the Toba super-volcano.

            Hard to imagine any future cohort ending up as being like the Boomers—although you did not describe exactly what that is.  Future cohorts will never be exposed to American prosperity and world dominance (military, technological, and culturally) as were the Boomers.  Such was the air we breathed in those days. Zoomers have a very bad beginning if they are to take on any of the “airs” of their Boomer predecessors.

I hope they grow out of it, they certainly could, but the Reagan revolution was supposedly hippies growing up, and it turned out to plant the seeds of this current mess. Idk, hope I’m wrong.

            But Boomers were greeted with job offers when the reached maturity, while the Zoomers are shunned in favor of minorities and illegals, with a much smaller job market to begin with…They will be the poorest generation, with a natural resentment of the system…

            You become what you hateI remember the boomers were big into not becoming materialistic and giving in to The Man.  But look how they ended up.  The most self-absorbed and materialistic generation I have ever known.I think the thing with the Zoomers is that they want to have lots of money and material goods but they got the short end of the stick in that regard so they are continuing on with an anti-boomer ethos that strikes me as more a matter of convenience than conviction.Nick will not be able to resist the allure of riches for too long.  But if he does and becomes something of an ascetic figure then I will stand corrected.Plus they are the children of Boomers.  It’s in their upbringing to end up in a similar way.

                By and large Gen Z are the children of Gen X, not Boomers. A significant number would be grandchildren of Boomers.
Boomer children are predominantly Millennial, and among the earlier, “Woodstock Wave” cohort, Gen X.

Someone should have told Mick and Keith this 40 years ago.  I saw a meme with God telling Adam garden instructions. When Adam points to someone in the corner of the frame and asks, “Who’s that?” God replies, “That’s Keith Richards, he was here when I got here.”

        I really like “The Culture Code” by Clotaire Rapaille. This is a fun and insightful book about world cultures, and, mostly, about American culture. I have never forgotten about its observation that American culture is an adolescent culture. He explains it in a way that it is too long to write here but it is very convincing. If you want a good reading, I fully recommend it.I have thought lot about that because American culture has exported this adolescence to the entire Western culture and I see it in my country. While kids have no freedom and no responsibility, adults have all the freedom and all responsibility. Teens or adolescents want all the freedom without any responsibility. So they rebel against their parents while assuming their parents will help them if the consequences of their freedom go wrong.This is the stage of our Western culture and comes from the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment talks about freedom and rights but not about duties and responsibilities. How many politicians or normal people do you know that speak about rights? How many do you know that speak about duties? The score is about one million to zero. So the Enlightenment is an adolescent ideology/religion. It took two centuries for it to take hold, because American people followed Christianity, which is a religion with duties. These Christian duties permeated society, like the Confucian emphasis on duties permeates Chinese society. Christianity and Confucianism are adult religions/ideologies.But, since the 60s, the elites achieved what they had wanted for centuries: uproot Christianity from the American population and replace it with the Enlightenment ideology (in its last version: liberalism). For then on, Western population has returned to a state of perpetual adolescence.People talk about infantilization but it is no so. Children are happy to do what they are told. Western people want rights without duties.  Westernsociety is structured to encourage this adolescence, with the State taking the role of parents. For example, “Be free! Fornicate! It is your right! You are pregnant? No responsibility! Abort”In most societies, adolescence does not exist. You go from being a kid to being adult with all rights and responsibilities, through a rite of passage (for example, chasing a lion). In case of women, the rite of passage is marriage. In our Western society, adolescence goes from the age of 10 to the age of 40 at least, but I have seen 80 years old to be mentally adolescent. These are the fruits of the Enlightenment.

        I said this below:  “a reason I do like Fuentes is because that zany Abby Ginsberg vibe is hiding a future Knights Templar beneath.”Now, the Zman calls David Duke a failed grifter; like George Lincoln Rockwell, he was an early Revisionist, and all of them were failed.But, they were not; failed only in their time against overwhelming odds, the Nazi and Klan cosplayers still kept alive a corpus of historical detail to counter the altered reality we’ve all been taught.  They planted the seeds in whose shade they shall never sit.Let the young be young; this stuff doesn’t get serious or interesting until a certain age anyways.

            What was both funny and sad about George Lincoln Rockwell was that after he was assassinated, his children would not claim the body. Ostensibly, it was because they were so offended by his white nationalist views. Maybe it’s just me having grown up around a lot of idiosyncratic ethnics, but so what? He’s your dad. So what if he marched to his own drummer? Blood is thicker than kumbaya.

            Maybe it’s just me, but I find it a bit depressing that all the big summer concerts are headlined mainly by acts from the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

        In the past, any sort of nascent anti-establishment/protest/right-wing movement would fizzle out because the establishment would either find a way to integrate these people, or would just get completely co-opted (as Z discussed with the Tea Party). It is very clear, especially since 2020, that the regime just has no interest in integrating these people, because it hates them and wants them dead and has no compunction about saying so. When companies are bragging about 94% of their hires being vibrants, the chance of these young groypers finding jobs and moving up the ladder like their parents did is very slim. And even if they DO get hired, they grew up in the world of cancel culture, they know how to keep their “power level” hidden. The groypers were also forged as a movement by taking on conservacucks, so it’s quite unlikely they will let themselves get co-opted by those people, nor will they allow themselves to fall victim to fedposts and glowies. They promote clean living (Catholicism/no porn/no drugs/etc.) so less likely to fall victim to passions the way millennials/gen x/boomers did.It’s a movement built by and for the internet age. NAFO showed the regime doesn’t quite get it. I do think Nick has made overtures towards making his message more serious, but this weekend proved he is not there yet. I will be interested in seeing where this goes next and how the young groypers vs. the older folk who agree with the basic message respond.

        I find Fuentes off-putting, to say the least, but do not discount the ability of this stupid Regime to do something moronic to extend his expiry date well into the future. The Tribal psychopaths who deplatformed him gave an insight into this clumsiness. He easily could become a martyr due to the ham-handed idiocy of this feeble Regime. See the prosecutions of Trump for further instructions into how the Retarded Junta shoots its dick a lot.Calling Fuentes a grifter is a way to feel good about losing.Yep. It is somewhere between cope and jealousy.This raises the question of the expiry date for Nick Fuentes.See the first above. It looks like an easily tilled ground is opening up for massive and violent draft riots. Fuentes probably has noticed, and the Regime is perfectly capable of throwing fuel on the fire he starts.

            It is a tempting comparison, but the young white males attracted to Fuentes would have been college republicans in a different age, but instead the college republicans are run by girl boss and some homosexuals. They are the first fully dispossessed generation, so they are free radicals looking for a home.
Juggalos would have been potheads who watch cartoons, just without face paint and bad music in a prior age.

        Glad to see you are giving Fuentes another chance.  I didn’t like his face at the start, and his ways, but he has grown on me, and I have respect for him.  If bored, a listen to his podcasts is always good for 20-30 minutes of entertainment.  Especially when he bags on young women.  “She is post-wall” is a pretty funny comment, which is what he said about Lauren Southern.  I am always up for some good boomer bashing too.Yeah, I don’t know where he takes this thing.  His true “problem” as it were, is that he can be boring.  He has a lot of skills, but the consummate entertainer isn’t oner of them.  But perhaps that is part of his broader appeal. I don’t know.

            From the relatively little exposure I’ve had to them, they seem like a very lost group of young men searching for an identity.   Everything they do is cartoonish.  They have somehow managed to fetishize their alleged commitment to not being degenerates and turn it into a joke.

            As Tars points out these are probably young men wandering in the wilderness looking for some guidance, leadership, and a chance to step up and accomplish something.I wouldn’t be too hard on them. As a Gen Xer there were plenty of times I didn’t know my butt from a hole in the ground at their age. And yes, I did physical labor and changed oil on my car and got paid to change oil and tune up cars for others. But that was another time and place before “Undocumented Migrants” poured across the border and took the physical labor jobs and old junk cars could be bought for a few hundred dollars. Now cars are so freaking expensive a young man is lucky he can find one.Remember these guys too have been helicopter parented and have been held back so the girls and Certain Demographics can move to the head of the line.

            It’s been my experience that if you want to be around “kids” that can inspire you, you need to live in a more rural area. Kids that grow up on farms and ranches, or at least know how to hunt and fish, etc., can be a real white-pill. Recently I went to my son’s 8th grade “Promotion ceremony”. There were about 80 students, with only a few non-whites. It was beautiful.
Like I said, huge white-pill for our potential future.

                    Yeah, I caught that too. What happened to the tradition of “graduation”? And yes, I went to my children’s grade school graduation back I. The day.
Maybe I’m too cynical (I am), but could we be looking at some new “woke” renaming due to some new woke insight wrt educational promotion?

            This is a classic Boomerism along with pulling one’s self up by the bootstraps.  You’re a throwback to a different era; an era that our enemies have done everything to ensure will not be repeated.  Don’t take it out on us suburbanites, we’re just the product an extremely feminized society that loathes self-reliance and wants you dependent on the system for everything.

        My take on this is that Fuentes, who I know little about, having read nothing by him nor have I ever listened to him, is a failure and just another grifter because he’s inside politics grifting. Basically just a pop star performer. He is not providing employment, legal protection, lobbying, or anything else for his followers other than fleeting entertainment. That’s it. He’s the niche White male version of Taylor Swift. And as forgotten as she will be in ten years.What matters is not what political actors say, but what they do.The opportunity is for SCALE. That is, to offer young White men who have basically nothing else for them: patronage, a job/social/friendship network, and protection both legal and otherwise for those who have nothing and are tiny individuals against the fury of the Woke-persons.Con Inc offers a very reduced version of this. They can act as gatekeepers to Washington, but outside of say the 20,000 they provide direct patronage for, their influence is limited. Someone will take up the crown, found lying in the gutter.Fortune 500 companies won’t hire White guys. At the most, lesbian girls who have Saturdays booked. And that’s only 6% of their total hires. Government is even worse. The military plans a massive draft (terms of service likely to be six years inevitably extended to ten) to send most White men off to die in Ukraine or Taiwan. Small business is being strangled by Woke bureaucrats.So, like most revolutionary groups, someone will start off by being the employer of last resort, and move patronage from there. Politics are pretty simple, it is the SCALE that is hard.

        I have my reservations about Nick Fuentes.  But he has managed to disrupt things in a generally positive direction and do so far more effectively than all of the superannuated paleocon losers put together.
The Cookie Question video alone was genuis: take their holy of holies and the basis of the moral system that is murdering our people, shit all over it in a way that a five year old can grasp, and laugh while you are doing it.
But who thought it was a good idea to hold a political conference in Detroit?

        In addition to we Southern Europeans and people from other parts of the Mediterranean who were also Christian subjects of the Roman Empire, there is one other way this white nationalism stuff gets confusing. Guam, Hawaii, the Pacific Islands and other possessions are part of America. That means Asians are part of society and have been for the last 125 years or so. Puerto Rico (and Cuba), same. Plus, we have our de facto colonies all over the place.  Oh, and let’s not forget our Indian population, Alaska and places like that.Now, don’t get me wrong. I am all for keeping this a country populated by people predominantly of European ancestry. I am not a fan of third world immigration from the East. However, since we have both Asiatics, American Indians and Latin Americans as part of this Nation and have had for some time, where do you draw the line?Some people might find it offensive, but I think the only good way to do it is with quotas.

        I don’t trust Fuentes after J6. However, I’ve been watching him closely since 2018 or even earlier, and I do have to give him credit for one thing: he’s actually acquired a small amount of knowledge over the past 2-3 years, which he hadn’t demonstrated to that point. His shows were almost 100% about him or drama from his little entourage.I still don’t know if this can translate into anything. I don’t think he has what it takes. That’s completely subjective on my part. I see how he can move his crowds, and he’s got a fair amount of talent, but it’s time now for him to move fully into adulthood.Of course, it could be that my way of defining “adulthood” and seriousness in life is now out-of-date, and this is how men in their 20s behave.

        First the axiom. We are not going to diagnose our way out of the mess we’re in. Remedy has to get real or we die, and it really is that simple.And there is a place and a path for anyone and everyone who genuinely wants to be part of the solution. And every path must be tangible in its nature. The only purpose for words alone is camouflage, but anonymity is better. You don’t want to be noticed coming or going. You want the bystanders to say “WTF just happened.” If you give them a good reason, they will go away; one way or the other. Only then can we grow healthy again.

            Whoa shinola.  Good stuff here, Tom B, as in detail.  Plus, it speaks to the Christians in their own dialect.  A bit too strong-stomached for many, but it don’t flinch.  We need an army, and they have fielded quite a few.I see this link as an echo of the US South Rise Again movement and can only support its attempt to break the grip of Dispensational religion.*What we’re short of is zealots; a reason I do like Fuentes is because that zany Abby Ginsberg vibe is hiding a future Knights Templar beneath.  Underneath the bad hair, Ginsberg was ruthless and implacable, and so must we be.*Completely unrelated, had the South seceded, it would’ve been another Canada, an English-speaking country.  North America should be a patchwork like Europe was and needs to be.  The White Flowers are varied, and all of them beautiful.

                Too much diversity in the South. It would’ve been the Brazil people say is the future. They understood that, Northerners didn’t. Now we all get to enjoy it.
Besides, I’d guess the South would’ve ended up back in the British fold, given cotton and free trade.
Steep price keeping this nation, seems we tapped out some time ago.

        You focus on Fuentes a lot, but is he really worthy of that much attention? In terms of gravitas, I see him as a bit player–like a poor man’s  white nationalist Ben Shapiro.

He is doing something weird with his mouth that I’ve only seen people in the  90’s do after ingesting any number of shall we say elixirs that are a kin to bathtub gin. The bullhorn the quaff of hair the fat guy next to him screaming down with Israel, the sneaker guy getting punched in the mouth, what a freak show. Absolutely no hope for this country as of now unfortunately. Hang on lads.the best is yet to come. Z said it was going to be a hot summer.

        One of the questions I have in the back of my mind is, What do the white nationalist types think of Southern Europeans? I know in the gangster movies Italians are called guineas (even joking about it themselves) because, like most Southern Europeans, they are darker complected and assumed to have ancestry from North Africa (Guinea). Are Italians these days considered white enough to be part of White America or are they more like Mexicans?The reason I ask is that we seem to be splitting hairs here when it comes to Armenians, Turks, Asiatics, Greeks and whatnot and how we define them. I’m just curious who falls into the white category. Or is it kind of like Hitler calling whoever his ally was an Aryan. Hitler supposedly hated Slavs, but he had no problem with Bulgarians and Croatians since they were allies. The Nazis even spared most Bulgarian Jews from slaughter because Bulgarians were in an uproar.My personal definition is that if you are from Northern Europe, what used to be the Roman Empire, including the Byzantine Empire, and its frontiers (which would include European Russia), and from a Christian society, you’re white enough.

            Ideally, in a perfect fantasy world, I wouldn’t have to live around anyone but other Anglo Saxons/Teutons (with vacations to where the Scandinavians and French live if I wanted to be exposed to something more exotic). Slightly more realistically, I can accept other Europeans as white also, if I have to. I draw that line at Gibraltar, Malta, the Bosphorus, and the Urals.

                That one also gets confusing for me because of Christian immigration from the Middle East. Danny and Marlo Thomas and Jamie Farr I think would generally be accepted as white in both yesterday and today’s America.

                        Yeah, I was thinking about that as I pushed the post button, but I don’t want to make my posts too long and boring. I agree with your last thought. Christianity in the context of Europe and its frontiers. You almost have to go through a bureaucratic process to draw all these distinctions, though.

                    I wish our people would take a longer and broader look at identity. Here comes my take on it: I’m American with ancestors arriving from England in 1600s Virginia. An occasional Dutchman or Huguenot are our “noggers” in the woodpile.   That said, even as a working class/ lumpen proletariat kid who grew up in a black neighborhood I could never think of White people not including our cultural and religious forbears in the Mediterranean and Fertile Crescent. How in the world could I think of the marvels of history and culture and not realize that America and White Americans were part of something greater— and that we’re not necessarily the cultural or biological acme of that greater body.I later lived in Italy, speak the language, and as much as I love my own homeland I feel at least as home there in a real culture literally surrounded by the stones of my people’s history. If the people whose ancestors produced our classical culture , and frankly have morerefinement and grace than my closest blood relatives, are not “White” to folks here . . .  well, that is some rank ignorance.My family by marriage includes second, third and fourth generation Lebanese and Syrian Americans. ( when they first got off the boat all were called Syrian). If physiognomy is the standard, I guess they are whiter than the branch of the family that intermarried with Scots and have brown eyes and hair.  The Arabs in the family throw off blond kids. To top that off their ancestors invented the progenitor of our alphabet, lived in those places Jesus and the apostles walked and shared their faith with my much revered Celtic and Germanic ancestors, thanks be to God. I don’t feel superior to them. Among that part of the family there is about the same distribution of patriotism and White identitarianism as on my side of the family. (It also has a branch that is deep in the neocon / progressive establishment sad to say) It is just that their idea of “White “ overlaps with Western and Christian. (I just remembered a distant cousin visiting California from South Africa — that guy served in the South African army alongside all the other White men his age.  He would not have taken kindly to an American questioning his “whiteness“. Nor would I.I remember Z talking once about his Lebanese and Armenian buddies in Boston being on Team Honky and I thought the same about those folks I knew in LA and elsewhere. I’m happy to include the rest of the Levant if they continue to want to join us, but that implies we are civilized, strongand Christian, and worthy of being joinedHappy Juneteenth!

                Im the same way but from an Italian perspective.  Ideally I wouldn’t have to live around Anglos or north Germans (i.e. the Protestant world) but fate had other plans.  But I still may move to Italy or Spain, maybe France.  The older I get, the less I can tolerate Protestant society and what has become of it.

                        I get it, but at the same time the “explosive” manner of the southern Europeans is a tad overblown.  At the same time, the millions of little rules and laws that come with north European “orderliness” is what I have a hard time dealing with.  In Italy you have one-tenth the rules but not anywhere near one-tenth the orderliness.  Italians are perhaps unique, that if you leave them alone they end up being rather orderly by their very nature.We all have our place.My personal observation is that society makes a taboo what most affects their people.  Say, not drinking too much, which may be more of a natural problem for Northern Europeans than for southern  ones.  Southern European taboos are largely a way to keep them in line and not to succumb to their own natural vices.

                    Falcone:  Perhaps that’s because you are a first generation American (I think you said your father immigrated; correct me if I am wrong).  My husband is half Italian on his maternal side, but it was his great-grandparents who immigrated in the 1880s.  He feels equal affection for and connection to his celtic and Italian forbearers, and although baptized Catholic as an infant, he is a non-denominational protestant.

I am also an Italian citizen, dare I say a “dual citizen” with all that nasty baggage that comes with such a distinction thanks to you know who.But I understand the “white” thing for people who lost their ethnic identity.  It’s a shame really, and it makes my smoldering hatred of what America has become grow all the more intense because I see in it a grand experiment to rob people of their ethnic identity so they could in effect neuter them and rob them of their family.  It’s just one more way America is all about destruction of the nuclear family.    It’s perverse, this lingering Puritanical obsession with making people “clean” — i.e. without a history or tradition or family.  A clean slate.  But in the end it means we are just atomized and weak and putty in the hands of the oligarchs.

                            Technically, we’re both second generation. Our parents were first generation. Maybe that’s why the European identity is so important to me and maybe that’s why I can see what the average dummy in society can’t see.This whole exercise isn’t just about race and religion. It’s about maintaining the cultural fabric of society. If they mix us up, people have no sense of identity, religion or any of the other things in society that bind people together, not to mention culture classes that create unstable marriages and families.But the leftists don’t care about that. Their whole life centers around nobody getting in their way of having their eight second orgasm.

                Well, as a southern European, thank God I made the cut. 😂 WOP women are better looking than Greek women by far.
Now what do we do about Albanians, Bosnians, Kosovars, Pomaks and people like that? The father of Tom Hanks’ wife was a Pomak. Pomaks are muzzies, but from what I’ve read, they seem rather benign.

                    Don’t know anything about Pomaks–a cross between Poles and Macedonians? But all of the people you list are certainly white AFAIC. Genetics are prime, and those people are probably at least 80% Indo-European Slavic with a dash of Turkish and Arabic. What’s more, with the exception of the Bosnians and Kosovars, they’re Christian, which, within the European context, is a marker of whiteness.

                        They are basically Christian locals that were converted to Islam. I relate that term mostly to Bulgarians, but it could also apply to Greeks and Macedonians as well since Rita Wilson’s dad came from the Greek side of the border. This exercise of labeling people is an interesting exercise for sure.

                WOPs are white from the vantage of taxonomical, as it were, observation, but not spiritually or philosophically.   Or any ways that come from the individual as a true expression of their souls.But if you consider white to really mean “English,” as I do, then no.And I get the argument “But BLACKS consider you white !!”So what.  Now they define me?  I can’t help it if they’re ignorant of the nuances of European peoples and our long history.  Ok, so if I am walking down the street and some blacks are out “Polar Bear Hunting,” then they will see me potentially as a target for the knock out game.  But I don’t live in fear of them or in awe of them, and I am never going to let something like the fear of an attack by them cow me into letting them decide who I am as a person on purely racial terms.And I won’t let prison gangs define me either.In my view, the crux of the “white” thing is 99% about fear and nothing else.  People of European extraction are scared and looking for strength in numbers.  I get it.  But I’m not.  And I know I am not English, I know I am not “white” in the true sense of the word, and I really don’t care.  I know a lot of English people, and they don’t want me on their friggin team, so why intrude?  They have enough of their own problems.But for me this brings up an important discussion.  Who are we?  Are we a taxonomical distinction?  IOW we are who a social scientist says we are, and if they say I am white then by all means I have to be white?    Even if if I dont want to be?  I have no choice?I am not who I say I am?  I don’t get to define me?  Who I am is determined by outsiders?  See what I am saying?It’s all a bunch of horseshit if you ask me.   I’m a dago, always am, always will be, and that’s how I like it !! :). Now where’s my fugging spaghetti !!

                    What you’re describing are cultural expressions of your dago ethnicity, and that’s fine. There is diversity in whiteness. Icelanders express their culture differently from Bulgarians, just the same as Portuguese and Estonians. However, whether you’re a Kraut, a Limey, a Frog, a Johnny Reb or a Pollack, you are still white because your genes say you are. We all share far more genetic material with one another than we do with Chinks, nuggras or any of those other non-Indo-European peoples.

                        I’m squarely in the genetics camp. There are lots of fascinating twists with that take, too. Someone above mentioned Lebanese or implied them. There are quite a few, and almost all of them Christian, with nearly exclusive white genetic markers. They almost certainly are direct descendants of the Phoenicians, who got friendly with whites all across the Med. There are also many Christian Arabs, probably the vast majority, who most definitely do not have that genetic profile.The pre-Islamic North Africans in fact were white Mediterranean people, too. To spitball, the Lebanese Christians with genetic white markers did not have the contamination of blood that most Arab Muslims developed after interbreeding with Sub and Malay slaves. North Africans were not spared any predations of the Religion of Rape, though, because most weren’t People of the Book. The Religion of Rape certainly violated People of the Book, to be clear, but not with the same impunity and ferocity inflicted on idolators.More White genetic markers also are found among tribes isolated from majority populations in, say, Afghanistan, where the Tajiks have less blood corruption than their brethren in Tajikistan itself, likely due to better protection from the Religion of Rape in the Kush. Castes and classes also led to white/whitish folks with Brahmins and the upper crust of Latin America as examples.Culture and religion certainly narrow the definition, but the offspring from say a Belgian and a Brahmin likely will integrate into Brussels without much effort while a Tunisian never will be anything other than an outsider.(Re-reading the above before I hit “post,” it is horrible the role rape has played for millennia in the destruction of our people, with the same playing out even more rapidly now)

                    I got your spaghetti here, brother, if we ever cross paths. And bracciole like my friend’s mom made!I get your point about whiteness being an identity for the “English”   It brings to mind that the Amish use the term “English” for everyone not in their ethnos.   I grew up deracinated due to parents having fallen out of respectable society and growing up in a neighborhood of similarly displaced whites and Southern blacks.  White was an identity that was both imposed by black thugs and one that transcended my surroundings.I chose to move to Italy when young, in the Navy, and given the choice of Hawaii or Naples.  The historical setting was appealing enough, but the opportunity to live in a white country where I could melt in and not think about being white was what really drew me. It became home and where I returned for school.Z and others would say I had a negative identity of “not black”. Maybe. Our natural grouping as kids was whites, “Mexicans, Indians ( red) and the occasional Chinese or half-Japanese kid. We were all “White” because we weren’t black and we looked out for each other.  I’m still a white nationalist and called myself that 40 years plus ago when I was 20. It was curious to Italians, except those who had spent much time in more diverse parts of New York or New Jersey.  I am sure white identity comes more naturally in today’s Europe.

                        White identity always exists nascently. External threats–chiefly from dieversity–force it to become explicit.

        “The politics of this generation are the politics of the internet, not the meat space.”
I was kind of hoping that this meant that they would leave us geezers in the meat space free to operate–that they would leave us alone.
But then you said; “Politics as professional wrestling is fun for the twenty-somethings who are naturally drawn to it, but in time they will have to have real lives.”
Them leaving the virtual world for the world is a frightening image…
