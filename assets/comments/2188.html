        Here’s the problem. The Office of the President is not entitled to demand that ANY State (ie)”issue drivers licences” to ANYONE, and the current office holder is, or should be, fully aware of that.ANYONE in the Senate, or House, is merely upholding their oath of office in “obstructionism” to all efforts to aid and comfort overt criminal behavior.

        The Socialist Internationale.  Gramsci.  The Frankfurt School.  The long march through the institutions, in this case the judiciary.  Workers of the world unite.  Global citizenship.Very often I am amazed at the amazement in commentary across the web following a post such as this — present company of course excluded.  Yes, we are living through interesting times regarding our borders, but the jaw-dropping so prevalent among the law-abiding citizenry indicates that the real intent of those in power has not fully sunken in for most folks.  Whether or not it does, I s’pose we are in for blood, sweat and tears either way.Leftists would declare that the value of the number seven will henceforth be five if it would suit their purposes, regardless of the consequences for accountants, scientists, math teachers, etc and moving government including its bureaucracies into the nonsensical and keeping their ways moveable are the preferred modus operandi of the Internationale.

        The solution appears to be very simple:  change Arizona law so that NO illegals awaiting disposition of their applications for permanent residency are granted drivers licenses.  According to your post, the problem was created by Arizona when the state chose to issue licenses to SOME illegals but not to ALL illegals.  What did Brewer expect the Court to rule, that it was OK for the state to pick and choose which illegals deserved to get drivers licenses?  D’uh.

        It strikes me that one of the biggest flaws of the current position of US policy — indeed of any country in the west these days — in that accepting illegal immigrants you are accepting people whose prime position is a total disregard for the law.If the law of a country says you cannot enter that country without permission then anyone who does, for whatever allegedly reasonable or supposedly justifiable is that they are arriving asa lea-breaker.If then people who arrive in a country as lawbreakers, then it follows they have no regard for the laws of that country. Of course, they may say they will abide by the law now they have been accepted as citizens but the truth is, surely, that they have clearly demonstrated they don’t care much about existing laws.

        You guys will be well and truly fcuked if any of the ‘conservative’ supremes retires before the Lightworker steps down.  Actually since the stupid party will fail in 2016 and your choices now are between the Billary and the Fake Indian, the I Hate America party should be able to seize SCOTUS before 2020.  Well and truly….

            Unsurprisingly, Vaseline sales are booming here in the States. We do know what’s coming.
