        May I be permitted to ask a question that is not pertinent to your current theme? Has anyone noticed the Lone Wolf Muslim attacks have suddenly stopped in the US (and elsewhere)?  And “surprisingly” BLM has lost interest in how poorly gangstas and thugs are treated, by the police, at just about the same time.

            Total coincidence. The fact that these were helping right-wing candidates and parties instead of the government parties is purely coincidental.

                Man, there are some intensely cynical dudes and dudettes lurking at this blog! Did it ever occur to you that your government merely has your best interests at heart?
I kid.

                Yes indeed, the Islamic attacks and BLM anarchy was helping to energize people leaning toward Trump. Suddenly, and simultaneously (almost) these “actions” stopped like a light switch was tripped. Normal, everyday Americans would have known, from the beginning, these actions would injure the progressive, totalitarian “Do Gooder” operatives vision. Of course the Boobus Americanus section of the audience would not have noticed. Ready made excuses at hand.  Will the “actions” pick up again right after the election?  Very best regards to you.

        Yes that’s pretty much what happens. Civilizations rise and fall because humans cannot sustain status quo. Last weekend we were invited to dinner with friends. They have a bright sixteen year old. Actually he is more than bright. He is quite opinionated and has no problem discussing politics. He was a Bernie fan. That should clue you. This time we got pretty deep into the major differences between socialism and capitalism. He truly believes that humans can work together,  achieve Utopia and expects that war will be only a historical reference in less than 100 years. Because, you know – detente – no one would even think about setting off a nuke because it would … WAIT! This is where I mentioned human nature and psychopaths rising to power.I watched his arguments as though I was seeing a flashback- we talked about Brexit. He was a Remainer, of course. Because, because, because you know. What I saw was the replication of my idealistic youth. It must be biological – endorphins bathing the brain in hope and trust in man’s ultimate ability to overcome human nature.I am a card carrying first tier Boomer. If I had taken my drama teacher’s advise I would have been among the student protesters at Kent State when the bullets rang out. I remember believing in Civil Rights and Make Love Not War and Trust No One Over Thirty.And then real life happened to me and I finally figured out that hope for mankind to change is a pipe dream. What changes is that good things always get hijacked by those who wish to dominate and rule. Words get redefined and good becomes evil. Civilizations rise and fall…

            My 16-year-old is the complete opposite.  He came to the realization that the left literally hates him and wants to emasculate him and his friends.  He walks around with a Trump hat just to offend them. He knows little about the policies differences but recognizes instinctively who is on his side.

                Treasure your teen. Interesting that our friends are staunch republicans and every advantage this kid has, which is above and beyond average, was provided by the company that his parents built from scratch. Perhaps it is true that prosperity is a drug that kills common sense.

            Though I didn’t realize it at the time, I got an incredibly lucky break in my HS Senior year.  We got sent off to do some pamphleting in a urban ‘ghetto’ (no one called it that, of course).  OK, I thought; the dirt on the streets and the cars are because they are poor, the shabby clothes ditto.  Dirty clothes and bodies?  Anyone can afford plain soap and the water is essentially free.  Then the people, young and old wandering around either drunk or with drugged out eyes, “Drugs cost money, booze costs money.” I thought.  The eyes that looked at us were either apathetic or hostile.  They must have brought us to a real ‘Sh*thole’ because I’ve been to many Black and Mexican neighborhoods since and most of those people were clean and as well attired as they were able to be.But seeing that first ghetto street and it’s denizens put me in a different place; in-between the  comfortable smugness of progressive do-gooders and the blank faced racism of contempt of most of the other people I knew. I’d like to help anyone that was trying to help themselves, but I resented being told to care about those that didn’t care about themselves and then I was supposed to feel guilty about myself to boot.Needless to say I did not fare well when I arrived at a liberal arts school the next year, it seemed that I was one the few in whom the cultural programming hadn’t taken hold.  The sex was nice but the constant pressure to try drugs and get swept up in the 60’s anti-establishment hatred wasn’t for me.  One year and out, then I started working for a living.  Is that conservatism?

                My story’s similar. Grew up practically a commie, then moved from the Upper Midwest to New York City. New York at the height of the Dinkins terror. Eyes opened. If this is what liberalism brings, NO THANKS!

                That sounds like something Loretta Lynn said. “Soap’s cheap and water’s free”. Her mother did not tolerate dirt, even though they were poor.

        We’ve simply lost the tether to what came before us.  And to what existential risks really are.  Growing up, my grandfather (a veteran of the WWI trenches) used to tell me stories about his grandfather (GAR ’61-65- one of the 20% of his regiment to survive) who related to him stories of the last living veterans of the Revolution who were still alive when he was a boy in the 1830s.  Used to joke that in the 2000s I was still just three degrees of separation from the founding.  But it does give one perspective on the sacrifices made for the world we take for granted today.  A couple years ago after DiBlasio was elected in New York was having lunch with some old colleagues down that the Standard under the High Line and someone wondered aloud “How the hell did DiBlasio get elected”.  I said, “Because all these twenty and thirty somethings weren’t here and don’t remember that this very spot was someplace you only went if you had a death wish in 1990”.  Memories are short and people are willing to buy into “end of history” nonsense.

            I, too, am a hop and a skip from the American Revolution.  My paternal grandmother, whom I never met, was born in 1856, died in 1926; her mother was born in 1817 and died in 1900.  Rev War ancestors a-plenty.  One of my forebear’s family, not direct descent from him, was Lemuel Cook from CT who was the oldest Pensioner from the Revolution, passing away after the Civil War.  My father was the youngest of six, born in 1899, and was a real history buff.  Every conspiracy “theory” bandied about today I heard at his knee in the 1950s/60s!  The first thing we watched on our new tv set was the Army-McCarthy Hearings.  I got an earful about all sorts of things and it has shaped my worldview to this day.  I feel fortunate to have this long view of history and feel part of it, which is why I hate that people want to eliminate/alter the facts of what has actually happened!

                    If you ever get the chance read Bierce’s “What I Saw of Shiloh”.  Not unusual to find Revolutionary Veterans that far west. It was not uncommon for veterans to be paid in “land bounties” by the cash strapped new government.

        Whenever I teach a history survey, I raise the question “what’s a government FOR, anyway?”  The kids always look at me like I’m speaking in tongues.  Such a thing has never occurred to them, even though they are theoretically bright / educated enough to get into a decent school, had history or civics in high school, and many of them are history majors.  Back in the Jurassic, this is why we read “the classics” — you may not agree with Hobbes, say, but he lays out an ironclad case given his premises… which voters under 35 have never even heard of, much less have the mental furniture to start refuting.  You’d think somebody even planned it that way.

            The purpose of government as a human phenomenon is to extract tribute from its subjects in order to sustain a dedicated warrior class in order for that warrior class to conquer and defend a piece of land from trespassers. The piece of land is secured in order to secure control of reproductive opportunity by securing control of reproductive resources—women—and to secure the safety of the vulnerable fruits of those resources made manifest, the young children fathered by both the warrior class and the men supporting the warrior class with their tribute.This is why the two most fundamental functions of government are taxation and the military, and why the police comes in a close third.The implication being that if that government becomes unable to defend the state with its military, it is illegitimate in that it will soon be conquered by a competing state, much the same way as when that government becomes unable (orunwilling) to defend its borders, it will rapidly lose its legitimacy and thus the loyalty of its citizens, its “men supporting the warrior class with their tribute”, who then go searching for a new government.

        What you write brings to mind the lessons learned in playing sports.  Namely, when your game is off, what did coach tell you … time to get back to basics.  Practice, practice, practice the fundamentals.  What the congress critters do is not demonstrable republican government, they have gone to jungle ball where they make up the rules as they go along to suit themselves.  The game they play is nothing resembling the government the Founders worked to establish through their hard work and wisdom.There have been times in my life, and I’m sure most people’s where you get so busy with “stuff” that you get overwhelmed.  Time to get back to basics.  Time to shed the unimportant and focus on First Things First.  This is true of citizens who think they participate because they “vote” every once in awhile.  Or like Christians who think they are good because they go to church on Easter and Christmas.  It takes daily, regular practice to get good at something and people do not want to invest in themselves because it takes too much effort, is inconvenient, and they think they don’t have the time.You bring up a good point in that the modern right has lost all bearing and knows not where it comes from or what it “should” be about.  Instead, it has been co-opted into the big game of playing the game of corruption and avarice.  They are no different from their opposition/enemy.Seems to me the Left has been much better at refocusing efforts when they go off the rails.  Off course, it helps tremendously when the complicit media is not beating them over the head stuff day and night and they can immediately change to topic of the day to whatever distracts from their mistakes.

        You can do the math.I can but I do much better with words. 🙂Conservatism is about freedom of association.Conservatism: to conserve, to hold on to, to keep that which works. thor’s definition.I always understood conservatism was about doing what was right, that is, the things that worked, or would for everyone if we all had the same basic view of each other. Keeping your word, building things that worked, giving an honest day’s pay for an honest day’s work, etc. The things that are morally correct. I’m not suggesting Puritan standards; just basic decency.  The freedom of association and non-aggression principle came when I developed a far more libertarian view of society, without changing my view of treating others as I wanted to be treated. The non-aggression is treating others the way I want to be treated anyway.We lost our way on everything when we decided as a society that anything and everything was acceptable.

            To take Mr Z’s theme here, the choice you have as a conservative is which door you choose to go through. Under our socialist masters, you don’t have that choice. They will tell you which is best for you and even, happily, provide the key to what they decide is best for you.

            I always associated “conserve” with a minimalist approach.  Government that governs more than absolutely necessary is pure waste.  Modern establishment “conservatives” have lost all perspective on this.  They think that raising spending by 4% rather than 5% annually is a victory for small government,

            I am a prime-time physical and mental age young son of the West whose literal ancestors literally founded and made this country, and I will in no capacity aid or abet the armed forces of this country until such time as they are no longer dedicated to provoking nuclear states and tempting nuclear holocaust, but expelling the 100 million foreign trespassers from the land my forefathers conquered. But after that, you couldn’t stave me off with a stick. I’ll drop everything to be a part of those armed forces.I suppose you might say I am a man without a country, looking for a country to secure and defend.

        I don’t see much evidence these days that policy has much to do with politics. Your garden variety congressman seems to readily acquire a fondness for free rides in the Gulfstream, free golf at Pebble Beach, and abundant bimbos. If he can pull down $100,000 per hour speaking fees and his kids can magically be admitted to Harvard, he will be quite happy to advocate any position that will allow the good times to keep rolling on.

        The room analogy is much like what most people do when lost in the bush. They make the same decisions over and over again and begin walking in an almost circular pattern. However difficult it may be, it is important to maintain a sense of orientation. This is what survival schools begin with because, after access to water and fire, this is of paramount importance. You’ve mentioned Russel Kirk in the past. He emphasized self examination of the movement on the basis of historically derived principles more than any of the other father’s of the movement. Buckley and his ilk are the guys out wandering around in the bush without any survival skills.

        There was an analogy about intellectual life that I cooked up in my brain when I was going to college in the late 70s:  You had these coliseum like games that were always playing.  Like the Sugar Bowl, the Cotton Bowl, etc.  Except they had different labels:  Religion, Art, Natural Science, and now a new game:  Economics or Managerialism, what have you.  Different, changing quantities and types of people were at all those games simultaneously.  But, the latest game is the latest *fashion*.  New games are always a big deal.   But, eventually many people grow tired of the latest fads and want something more established and migrate back to the older games.  I think we are at that place now.

        “The geezers came along when conservatism was focused on fighting the Russians and trying to figure out how to get around Roe in order to curtail abortion. The neocons are pretty much just hyper-violent globalists with a bizarre grudge against the Russians.”Neo-conservatives that rose in the 1990s wish essentially that the Soviet Union hadn’t collapsed. They grew up in the shadows of fathers and an establishment that framed itself as fighting against this enemy and they prepared themselves to join that fight only to see everything fall apart before they could step a foot out the door. Since then they have struggled to frame new fights to resemble the old one that they missed out on and have failed completely. So now they’ve reached the point where they are hoping to simply restart the old Cold War fight simply so they can fight it again and be a part of it on their own terms. Looking at it like that, I wouldn’t call the neo-conservative obsession with Russia bizarre or a grudge; it has less to do with Russia and more to do with the sad fact that the neo-conservatives don’t know anything else except how to fight the Soviet Union.

        I’m really enjoying your blog. Thank you. My children and I (we homeschool) read American history from original sources and Liberty minded publications so upon hearing what Conservatives™ actually think, I am shocked. Thank you for writing out how we got here. Although I find it nearly impossible to discuss current issues with people who can’t seem to understand/remember even basic principles. i used to consider myself a R and conservative. I’m not sure I can anymore.
