        Interesting take. An an early X-er myself, I grew up in a world defined by the Boomers. By the time I was fifteen I was already sick and tired of hearing Steppenwolf and Hendrix endless shit about how great Woodstock was.Nonetheless, I was a “conservative” because up until that point, The System provided a good life for the white male with a college degree, and even one without.That turned out to be no longer true by the time I got into the workforce. In order to succeed as a white man, you had to be like Walz — a go-along-to-get-along liberal guy willing to subordinate yourself to stupid, moronic and unqualified females. I didn’t, and I paid for it.I don’t regard Harris as a Boomer, she is just another idiotic college-girl Xer from the 1980s and 1990s who fucked her way to the top. I went to an undergraduate college that cranked ’em out by the thousands.What Z says about Millennials is true, though, I have never seen people more viciously pursuing credentialism, or more self-righteous and arrogant.

I probably will never emotionally connect with the Beatles because my teachers could not shut up about how amazing the Beatles were.
I can look at their music on staff paper and see the harmonic sophistication over what came before.
But those guys irritate the hell out of me, especially John Lennon.

                    My mind knows that they did some innovative stuff, but I can’t get past the smugness. Idiot Ringo still flashing peace signs. I just can’t tolerate it. John’s “Imagine” makes me angry.
If I must listen to the Beatles, I chose Abbey Road.

                            I Saw Her Standing There was a great early rock tune. Harked back more to the late 50s and early 60s than looked forward to the late 60s.

                        I wonder why people get so wound up over somebody else’s popular music. I didn’t think much of Guy Lombardo’s Royal Canadians, but I did not base my understanding of my parents’ generation on what I thought of “Stars Fell on Alabama”.

                    So true.  Thanks for reminding me of the bigger picture.  The Beatles often wrote great melodies.
Melody hardly exists in rap or electronic dance music.  It’s becoming a lost art.
Sometimes when I’m out, I’ll hear an old song that I used to dislike.  Say, something by that sappy band Journey.  Then I will realize how much more I prefer it to the terrible shit you often hear.  At least it has a melody and chord changes!

                        Rap is where music goes to die. Techno probably can only be appreciated on ecstasy.
But modern pop doesn’t have melodies either, let alone complex ones. It’s just whimpering to minor chords.

                    There is a near fugue in that pet sounds album. It’s Al least a hint of a fugue. Which is cool but there are better fugues out there.
if you think about it rock really had no where to go after pet sounds. A simple form more tinkering in the studio, hit or miss live, now what?
its an ok genre of western music that unfortunately was really influenced by African drum rhythms.

                because my teachers could not shut up about how amazing the Beatles were.
A similar memory was a relatively young teacher in junior high school getting all starry eyed and lubed up when she talked about how dreamy and perfect JFK had been.  It was weird for me then, and repulsive for me now to remember.

            I hear you there. I hate the boomer music you hear playing over the PA in certain restaurants and the like. I do like 70’s classic rock (Aerosmith, Led Zepplin) but rarely listen to it. I also like disco and funk(I know its uncool but I don’t care). The problem with boomer music its usually the soft crap that is neither hard rock or disco/funk. Its stuff like Billy Joel, Paul McCartney, or Elton John. I really hate this shit and hated it even as a kid. If I hear it in restaurant, I will ask for them to change it or I leave.

            I do respect the boomers in certain ways. I have no knowledge of the 60’s boomers. But I do remember the boomers who came of age in the early to mid 70’s. I admire their dynamism and spirit of independence. They ALL emphatically got their driver’s licenses on their 16th birthdays and youth car culture existed at the time (this died by the early 80’s). They were always going places with their friends in cars. A young guy in Columbus OH in 1975 would throw his kit in the boot and drive out to California at the drop of a hat.Some of us trooped off to the Sun Belt in the 80’s. But it has been several decades since youth have done such in large numbers.

As a grilling boomer who enjoys sportsball, I haven’t read enough – in fact, I haven’t read anything – about the effect of the draft for men born 1948-1955 on why we are the way we are.

            Late boomer/early X seems distinct from later X, like the border is misplaced. We younger ones are more like the stereotype, losers regardless of status. Our slight elders of Kamala/Walz’s age aremanagement enthusiasts, the first cultural and corporate enforcers of “woke” as we know it, etc. They’re on a mission. Millennials embraced and extended it. We ducked while it flew over.My excuse for X never taking its turn at the helm of government has always been that the few of us with any interest in politics are either too “woke” or too “based” for mass appeal, a generation of repulsive extremists. But now that mass appeal doesn’t matter…JOY™

                Generation X was a term coined by Douglas Coupland in the title of one of his books. It is appropriate that a fictional universe defines this (real) generation. Like fiction, Gen X is an open book, easily readable. Also like fiction, Gen X deserves a happy ending for having slaved under the shadow of the Boomers for so long.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

                Yep. Big difference between early and late Xers, and probably between early and late (male, the females are all hopeless) Millennials too. Ron DeSantis is one of the few Xers who went into politics (more or less) successfully. Most Xers who are strivers went into business (Elon anyone?!) and sports (Tiger, Phil). But I also agree and witness that the vast majority of Xers settled for mid level, often engineering or technical sales, jobs rather than making it to the very top.Xers currently really are the very backbone of everything that still works.When they retire, we’re all f*cked.

        I am at the very leading edge of the millennial generation.  Millennials think that having a credential equals competence.  Sometimes that’s true, but more often than not in this day and age it simply means the credential holder is good at ticking boxes and following orders.  On the whole, my generation is not good at critical thinking or navigating uncertain waters.  Even worse, many millennials think that having a magic piece of paper makes them smart.  Personally, I’m not excited about my generation taking the helm.  All the worst people I’ve worked for have been millennials, and as you point out, most ofthe women have heads full of nonsense.  Vance performed well in the debate, but life’s most critical moments often depend on making decisive decisions based on uncertain information.  Can the millennials as a cohort handle the increasingly chaotic world we are entering?  Perhaps, but I have my doubts.

            I’m noticing that a lot of older Millennials are finally figuring out that their credentials do not count for much, and that nothing beats experience. Unfortunately, it seems like they are about ten years behind where they could have been. I find they tend to lean on Gen X a lot. The Boomers I worked with really had a hard time letting the Millennials get experience and take on more responsibility. Not sure why, but now that the Boomers are retiring, Millennials seem to be doing better.

I’m optimistic, but with a realistic bent. I share your worry about our generation, as they seem to be the living manifestation of an appeal to authority (see above LinkedIn).

            I just read an AEI op-ed about the current lack of Navy missile production. This op-ed was written by an early Millennial Karen Swampite with all the right credentials in her bio.
Apparently, having the right credentials absolves one of clicking on the “Spelling &amp; Grammar” button in Word to address incomplete sentences, run-on sentences, poor grammar, lack of punctuation, and obvious typos.
This swill is what our betters in DC are publically posting, yet people still wonder why the GAE is falling apart.

Here is the link to her recent AEI/National Interest op-ed about Navy missile production:

I enjoy the fact there is a typo in the first two characters of the piece. Equally amusing is the fact the first run-on sentence is also the first paragraph of the piece.

                            I work in the DoD Acquisitions world. This is an article written for an internal audience, not for public discernment. DoD Acq is jargon-laden and unnecessarily complex, probably like in academia, to keep normal people away. Her larger point that DoD acquisitions is increasingly a process-obsessed self-licking ice cream cone is valid and *that* condition illustrates our increasingly obvious clown world conditions in DoD. High-fives over Aegis weapons system single intercept events is criminally stupid, considering that the missiles are effectively irreplaceable, terribly expensive, and … the ships firing them cannot rearm at sea, but instead must leave the area of operations to a friendly port to rearm. It’s impossible for our Sr mil leaders to not consider those issues unless the real metric they care about is Procurement funding for new kit, and not military operational efficacy.

            Vance is a perfect example of what you are talking about, which is why Zman’s enthusiasm for him continues to be baffling. Maybe its a generational thing to notice, but everything about JD screams inauthentic managerial box-checker who will say ro do whatever it takes to advance up the ladder.Soft military service bona-fide for admittance to the wing of the uniparty still open to young white guys, check. Diverse lawyer girl-boss wife to verify that he isn’t one of those types, check. Buttboy for Thiel to get his foot in the door, check. Slamming Trump as Hitler when it still seemed like the GOP might be able to co-opt the populist surge, check. Taking some sort of edgy positions once it was clear that Trumpism had won, check.Please clap for JD Vance.If we are going to have a diverse girlboss President either way, it seems preferable to having one whose face is attached to the policy for mockery of the DEI incompetence, rather than having one whose DEI incompetence gets filtered through the image of her soyfaced white husband after Trump’s Big Mac induced heart attack.

                If Vance were replaced by someone you would find satisfactory, who would that someone be?
This is a reality based question, so it has to be a real person, not a shopping list of ideas, attitudes and physical characteristics.

                    There’s no gotcha there. I’m the most stringent Vance hater around—more than any Democrat, I’d think, because I hated him when the TV said to like him—and I said before it happened that he was the best available VP pick. He and Lake are the only “name” Republicans whose careers fit the gig and who aren’tpresentlyanti-Trump. Lake is a goofy retard, a stereotypical Western shrew-publican straight from the ’80s with no appeal to men or their wives, so take the glow-creep. At least he cando media.I don’t think that’s how Vance got in, that Trump and his guys looked around and did the smartest thing. Not their style. But there was an event, one that left Rubio stranded. Do we remember? Let’s not. Too bleak.Instead, let’s focus on self-improvement! For example, when tempted to say anything that resembles “What color is your Bugatti?” consider what kind of person harbors such sentiments, and embrace whiteness instead.

                    “This is a reality based question, so it has to be a real person, not a shopping list of ideas, attitudes and physical characteristics.”My thought exactly.  I’m seeing a lot of easy sneers at Vance here.  But I’m not seeing much in the way of hard thinking on the margin, in the real world, with real people, considering real trade-offs.We could do far worse than to get Trump reelected in Nov. 2024 and then have Vance step into Trump’s place sometime later.  And, let’s be honest: we almost certainlywilldo far worse, and a lot of people rolling their eyes at Vance now will instead get to enjoy the tender ministrations of Komrade Kamala.  That, at least, will have the benefit of sobering people up hard.

                A couple of observations.Whe he and Masters first surfaced as born again MAGA-ites, his VC story smelled. What company had he led or backed that is for real. In those days, I looked at that firm’s web site. It didn’t look accomplished at all. A year ago, as Masters sank and Vance took Ohio’s Senate seat, they gave it a makover to make it look more impressive, though it still lacks real merit. The biggest thing they have is that he is buddies with Thiel.The other thing I noticed was that during the Palestine OH fiasco he went out to visit and get his photo op in. He posted an iPhone video of himself out by a creek that was more discontiguous puddles of water and mud than a creek. As he filmed the ground to show the petroleum slick, (very minor), in the water his shoes came into focus. He was wearing that Regime uniform of jeans, no socks, and those high end LouisVuitton house slippers – out in the mud at a major chemical disaster.It was all phony. Vance is certainly better than Walz if for no other reason he is well spoken and capable of pulling trick moves. The only hope for the stateless Americans in post-America are two and three faced politicians who will pull a Putin on the financiers and snooker them out of their occupational colonization project.Tough to pull off here, but that may be the only easy way out.

            Millennials and zoomers are in a two track world at this point. If you are a woman, or a non-white person, then yes, the credential equals competence. As long as you have that piece of paper, the system will take care of you. If you are a White man, well you’re probably not going to be able to get the credential, and even if you did, it doesn’t count for anything. So this means that the most resourceful and hardworking people of this cohort are forced to be resourceful, hardworking, and independent as they know the system and the society doesn’t want anything to do with them. We are seeing all over the place, in business (94% of hires are non-Whites), in the military (no White guys signing up), in the politics (zoomer girls morel liberal than ever, zoomer boys more right-wing (not conservative) than ever), etc. Interesting times.

                But in the trades the blue collar white guy is still 95% plus of the work force.  That is one place young white men can still excel.  Of course you have to work long hours in shitty conditions, but it is what it is.
Don’t see any girl bosses or magical nuggras restoring power in the Southeast right now.  Sure see a ton of big corn fed white boys busting hump working 20 hour days in the heat and humidity – making 90 dollars an hour or more.

                    Except blue collar trades is not where the power resides. It is not where policy is made. Working in a trade doesn’t protect your community from the brutalities of the imperial regime. I am sure that the regime would be quite fine with permanently relegating Whites to lower class status, working in the  trades, while opening the floodgates in their neighborhoods to Haitians and opioids. Well, we should have a problem with that.

                                    If you want to see what happens when these people who supposedly hold all this leverage get together to try to change things in opposition to the elites, look at the trucker protests in Canada a few years ago. They don’t really have the leverage you think they do after all.
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with going into blue collar work but it’s not a place you can accumulate power or influence. We still need elites. If you are a smart White kid who can get into Harvard, somehow, you should go to Harvard.

                                        Of course, individuals in blue collar work won’t acquire any of this power you speak of. The fact is that the blue collar workers and the more professional classes who keep the energy, transportation, communications infrastructure running could have a lot of power if they ever get around to organizing in a big way instead of piecemeal protests here and there.Whether or not that is possible, I cannot say. But the potential is there. The first thing to do is note what the truckers did and don’t try that again.At any rate, things have to get considerably worse before there could be serious,sustained resistance. I’m too old to be of much use, but the younger people should think about what they could do when things go bad instead of bellyaching about the boomers or fantasizing about separate societies.

                                They rarely succeed outright if by that we mean formally taking power. However, they sometimes scare the power structure badly enough to produce positive change. I’d be interested to see what would happen if the CFWBs (corn-fed white boys) deprived the megalopolei of food, energy and utilities.

                    I have a nephew in that part of the world who is one of those ‘big, corn-fed white boys’ doing just that type of work (HVAC). He’s one of those kids who truly gives me hope. Football star in high school, went to college on scholarship, quit college because he hated it.Worked his ass off in the HVAC world until he could start his own company, then worked even harder. Company is growing fast due to his friendliness, hard work ethic and happy willingness to do right by his customers. His new bride is working just as hard to support him and his business, about to have their first child.You can not hope to find a better example of what “should” be.

            Millennials were the first generation to experience the effects of AA.  So there is a mixture of pathological mediocrity and actual meritocracy.  This goes for *all* the races—as befits their “talented” percentages.  Hence the confusion in the various commentary comparing the abilities/contributions of Millennials, Gen X’ers, and Boomers.Bottom line is that—despite a general lessening of talent across the board—the best of the best of the Millennials are still as good as the best of the best of the Boomers in their day.  The playing field has only changed.  Millennials now swim/compete in an ocean filled with mediocrity—and the rules of the game have changed such that this mediocrity must be accommodated as if they’ve earned/deserve their (artificial) status in society.The challenge for talented, meritocratic Millennials is therefore to rise above such societal delusion rather than tolerate it.

                Nonsense.   GenX experienced all the joy of AA as others got promoted in a very tough environment as boomers were busy asset stripping everything and not training anyone.
BUT
Millennials either fully believe the AA nonsense or realize it’s all bull and they just have to play the game better.   “oh sure, I’m 1/1064″ indian”  with a completely straight face.  Something GenX would never think to do (well they might now, but it’s too late for them now)

                    We must agree to disagree.  Your hate of Boomers has nothing to do with what I said.  Boomers stripped nothing, except in your eyes. I assume you feel some Boomer above you “did you dirt”.  Too bad, deal with it.They (Boomers) were however the recipient of “good times” whereas succeeding generations were less so.  I assume you were of that follow-on generation, hence the blame game you are into.AA probably did affect Gen-X’s to an extent, but was endemic by the time of Millennials entering the workforce.  Assuming Millennials approved of such is painting with too broad a brush.  Such has not been my interaction with them.  However, I would agree that many of them can’t quite put their finger on the essence of the problem—a complete shift from meritocracy to “equity” among the races. They (Millennials) seem especially affected by IKAGO.The concept of equality, then affirmative action (under guise of a helping hand, but never preferences), then equity (through preferences/quotas) has been a long and slow evolution. I’ve lived through it—and it’s not over yet.  Nonetheless, the blame game produces only pity parties and gets one no where close to a solution as it masks the essence of the problem—people are not all of equal ability, and unequal ability shows among racial comparisons as well as individuals.

            It’s more than credentialism, it’s downright symbol fetishism, or totemism. Millenials don’t understand the difference between a symbol and its referent. That’s why they think by manipulating symbols they change reality.Give the BOM a conviction in a kangaroo court that Joe Stalin would have been ashamed of, and now he’s the convicted felon. Blow up the charge into three dozen sub charges and you can never shut up about the 30 plus felonies. Have a Haitian press a button on an app and he’s now a legal immigrant and nobody has the right to complain about him.It’s pure cargo cult. Academia is full of it. Perform the proper rituals and you can make a sub 100IQ DEI hire president of the most prestigious university of the world.The generation that grew up with Harry Potter running around, waving their $10 plastic wands and shouting magic words, fully expecting something real to happen.

        I just want to focus on Vance and not get into the debate about generations. Vance can process information, probably large amounts of information, and arrive at decisions on that basis. This can’t be done by Biden or by Harris, and probably not by Trump either. This is a key asset. If you’re talking of merit, Vance probably has it.

        Besides coming up from nothing, Vance has two very interesting – and encouraging – qualities.First, despite absorbing the feminine and liberal rhetoric of the establishment (thus his early dislike of Trump), he grew out of it and saw the reality of life. I’d suspect that many Millennial men had a similar experience.Second, as Z notes, he’s rejecting the managerial class that he so desperately wanted to join and that offers him an easy path to fame and fortune. King Cobra is doing the same. I’d suspect that these Millennial men from outside the tribe understand that they’ll never have a seat at the table, that their best hope to be a well-paid house servant. That’s not enough.They also seem to find the managerial class lacking in deeper satisfaction. It’s a shallow place with shallow people. They want more.

            I think the real reason for the class betrayal is that Vance (unlike the Boomers and X’ers) is young enough to spend all day everyday on the internet, and over the past 8 years he’s gradually become radicalized by all of our hilarious memes.

        I haven’t been able to get past the manufactured nature of Vance. How his memoir, when he was an unknown nobody, instantly became a glowingly reviewed NYT bestseller, with a movie version directed by Ron Howard. You might have noticed the NYT ignores big selling conservative books of which it disapproves. Perhaps there was a shortage of memoirs written by unknown, self absorbed people (that’s a joke).How he somehow became a venture capitalist with no evident prior experience in finance.His backing by certain people in the national security state/globohomo tech panopticon. His first job out of Yale, working for John Cornyn. Real dissident stuff. Up to 2016 there is virtually nothing to recommend him to us. Then, sometime between then and now, he undergoes some transformation in which he becomes “maga.” How genuine is it? I’m having a difficult time believing it is 100% genuine.His staunch backing of Israel puts him at odds with most of the rest of his generation. If there’s one big political change coming with the passing of the generations, it’s that, but it appears to be his job to counteract it. He has, of course, been photographed at the wall wearing a yarmulke.

        The interactions between Harris and Walz are straight out of a 1980s or 1990s sitcom or TV commercial that was written for Gen Xers and Boomers. On the one hand you have the goofball husband and on the other hand you have the wise and kind wife. The husband screws up and the wife fixes things. The best thing the husband can do is just shut up and listen to his wife and do what she says. Etc. They leaned into a surprisingly old-timey dynamic. I don’t know if this was intentional or just what fell out considering the sensibilities of the people who run the campaign. They doubled down on this with the “White Dudes for Harris” operation which totally fell flat, because this sort of dynamic inspires disgust in the vast majority of millennial and zoomer men. Things are going to change as people like JD Vance take the stage.

            It reminds me of the show The Jeffersons. The neighbor family was a black woman and a goofy white guy. What made the show funny was the absurdity of the race relations. In a better age, our betters could laugh along with the prols about such things. In this age, where our betters are incapable of laughter, the humor for us in the utter seriousness with which they present absurdist race relations.

Yes. I’d say about 90% of broadcast advertising uses this template. Once you notice it, you can’t unnotice it. It drives me nuts.
Invariably, the “solution” proffered by the “intelligent” woman is to call some white guy to fix the problem…

Turn off your TV, discontinue your newspaper subscription, go out and visit in person any of those venues.  You will see that any successful one is run by a White person.  Sometimes that person is also a female, as in Veterinarian practice.

        OT, but I thought worth the mention.I think it was BCE that had a story that related that citizens in the ravaged area of Appalachia, have begun to lynch looters and hang a sign on them reading “looter”.
While I can’t confirm this,(apparently 3 goblins were dispatched), I do like stories with happy endings.

        It’s also weird that the Harris/Walz ticket mentions that they grew up “middle class” every chance they get. A lot of the lemmings on the left are running around saying the Democrats are the party that helps the middle class and the working class. If we go by conventional markers of being middle class up through 2008 (having enough in your savings account to cover the cost of a new transmission, annual family vacations, home ownership etc.), there are far fewer people in the middle class and the concept is on its way out entirely. In the coming US you’ll either worry about money or you won’t and there won’t be many outliers. Part of the building dread in millennial and zoomer minds is that despite being the children of middle class parents and making roughly what their parents make, they can’t afford the lifestyle their parents had. When Bimbo and Bozo get up and start yakking about how they grew up with that quality of life, it’s pretty off-putting.

            “It’s also weird that the Harris/Walz ticket mentions that they grew up “middle class” every chance they get.”What’s the old saw, “…you use that word, but I don’t think you know what it means…””Middle Class” is simply a statistical abstraction for taking the three or so middle quintiles out of a rank ordered population and calling them “Middle Class”.  Ranked in terms of SES.  Duplicitous politicians use this description to paint themselves as knowledgeable of the life “problems/experiences” endured by the bulk of Americans.  They are not.Problem is, given the wealth disparity and inflation we’ve encountered over the last half century or more, what a Boomer or X’er has experienced growing up is nothing comparable to what today’s Millennial or Zoomer experiences.  Even the Boomers—as they retire—in the majority are hurting.80% of the wealth in this country resides in the top 20% of the population—most in the top 10%.  Today, you must have a couple of million in wealth to enter that anointed “upper 10th” category.  Any of you here got that money?  Thought so…

            I hear you.  I grew up with an experience much closer to Vance’s than Harris’ or Walz’s.  For some reason back in the early 70’s I got it in my head that I wanted to identify as “Middle Class” rather than poor White Trash, but I finally realized that while my home/neighborhood/school experience and working at a hamburger joint starting at age 15 in order to eat had nothing in common with the doctor’s children my age at church.  The rest of life I worked and studied around real Middle Class people, including Ivy Leaguers and others that graduated from or taught at Stanford, Duke, Oberlin, UCLA, etc.   Gravitational pull or returning to the mean brought me back to a situation closer to my family where I see up close the condition of loved ones who are struggling to reach stability in our society and economy.  They are working class White Americans pure and simple with little to no connection to higher concepts derived from Western Civilization readings or life in Europe and just concerned with feeding their kids, getting them to the Bible Church Sunday School,  playing youth sports and getting a job that with enough savings lets them buy a house.     Harris with her cosmopolitan background and Walz with his conformist social climbing elicit disgust, but I see Vance as one of ours who cares about his people– my people.  God bless him and I pray he is the real deal.

        Another factor for the future of politics is that for a lot of right-wing millennials is that we remember an America before the time of overt Leftist insanity. Of course, it was still there in the 90s and 00s, but the Left was more secretive about their ambitions. Now it is nakedly put out for many to see. Seeing signs declaring “mass deportation” in the crowds gives one hope that moving forward the ideas of the Right will take more precedence in politics. Time will tell if this creates the changes needed to correct the course our nation is on.

I’m optimistic when I come here (Zblog) and I view more of the above link. Pete Q (Xer), the other guys millennials and zoomers. Maybe the OGC (Old Glory Club) isn’t an answer in and of itself…..but we need to organize.

            I didn’t exist in the 70’s, but the so-called Reagan Revolution did beat a lot of that back, and it carried over into the 90s. Fraying by late 90s, then Dubya was enough of a disaster to provoke the reaction.
At least that’s how it looked on the ground. At the top, maybe something else was going on, idk. In hindsight, even Reagan looks like some sort of deal for ending the Cold War.

                    The Left has been hysterically railing against the specter of the Christian Right for over forty years now, since the heyday of Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority.  However, the only political victory the tradcons can point to is on the abortion front, in finally getting Roe v. Wade overturned.  On every other cultural front, it’s been a total rout in favor of the Left since 1980.

        As a GenX with 3 GenZ children I feel qualified to judge GenZ as strange. Not really liberal, but strange, VERY VERY VERY strange. Hanging out on discord playing Call of Duty or Minecraft and calling each other faggots is, apparently, a fun Friday night. Unfortunately, my children also love to send me memes all day every day. Memes that I do not understand, but are, apparently, hilarious.

            There seems to be a fine line between GenX and Millennial/GenZ recreation sensibilities wherein playing video games is viewed as either an absolutely normal form of entertainment and socializing, or the stupidest waste of time imaginable.  Must have been people born before or after 1982 because friends a couple years older than me don’t ever play video games and everyone I know my age or younger spends most of their free time playing video games.

        Do realize that Kamala is known as “kneepads” because that it how she got to where she is today. The fact that she is the democratic nominee is the surest indicator that the office of president is just a front person. Its the system itself that actually runs things.

            Do realize that Kamala is known as “kneepads”…This reminds me of some traumatic changes which dissidents ought to inject into the English language. One change is pronouncing the k in kneepads like the k inKnoblauchandKnofel, German words for garlic. When so pronounced, Kneepads has a guttaral stop (if I have the right term) at the beginning of her name, just like in the wordskamaandkarma.If you mean to conform to conservative speech, write ‘nneepads’. So, now we have a nice aliteration in six syllables: Kneepads Kamala. Knee sounds likeKnie, German for nnee, or knee, for those of us who are giving up conservatard English.It just so happens that “Kamala” can be parsed into two parts, kama + -la. The first means sensuality, as in the name Kama Sutra, and the suffix means seized. So Kneepads Kamala (remember the guttaral stops) is Sensuality-Seized Harris.

            An innovation in this years’s race is that nobody likes any of these people. Weside with thembecause we’re trapped. They’regiven.
Literally no one voted for Kamala, Walz had to transcend (flee) his district to get to an electorate unwhite enough to accept him, and Vance is a gay op.
Trump is a giant, but he disappoints everyone—and he’s not supposed to be alive. The Republican convention was the hated Nikki’s debutante ball (or bat mitzvah), thwarted by an inch.

        Trump was born in 1946, which makes him the first of the boomers. The Clintons (both) and Dubya were all born in 1946. The people born in the 1940’s had the world handed to them on a silver platter, and for the most part, they pissed on it.Walz’s problem is not that he is a Gen X. Its that he is a lazy leftist. He is a lot like Sanders in this regard. Most Gen X’ers are very individualists and, thus, not susceptible to the leftist collectivism espoused by Walz. Millennials are mediocre at best. They are the “follow the rules”, box checkers, mild collectivists reminiscent of the WW2 generation, but less competent. Many people in these alt-right circles idolize the WW2 generation. However, Karl Denninger most certainly does not. It was the WW2 generation that embraced the fraud of Keynesian economics and the resultant deficits that started with the Johnson administration (mid 60’s), among other things.

                Yes. My father was WW2 and mother the first of the Silents. I agree they were the obedient generation. They clicked their heels. The only generation I ever liked was my grandparents generation (born around 1900). They really were out on their own and did what was necessary to create their own lives. They were probably the last generation in this boat. The Silents were OK. I’m known many successful Silent entrepreneurs and business owners. They tend to be quite”Heinleinian’ in their style, politics, and worldview. Gen X’ers have some Silent vibe in them, but not as much as I would like.

        In the era of our ancestral evolution (predominantly small tribal units), the smartest and strongest rose to positions of leadership because that enhanced the survival prospects of the group. Then civilization and modernity happened, and man-made selection gave us Bush-the-Retarded, Fake &amp; Gay Obama, a pedophile dementia patient, and the soon to be elected first Prostitute President. The West has earned its demise, and we cannot talk out way out of this dilemma. Only the resurrection of hard men can save us now.

                    The birth year 1964 shades into both cohorts, I’ve always thought. They’re the latest boomers and the earliest X-ers (a term that never caught on with me, and seems meaningless—although maybe that’s the idea).
For an individual born that year, I speculate that the parents’ generation might speak to whether you metastasized into a boomer or X-er.

                            Thank you. The “Boomer” epithet is sometimes understandable, but it paints with way too wide a brush. In my experience there is a lot of variation within that “Dazed &amp; Confused” group, and not a terribly noticeable amount in common with the Woodstock or Yuppie types.

                            Yup. The Dazed and Confused combine the narcissism of the Boomers with the cynicism of the X-ers. Perfect dictator material, as in Sulla.
For them “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” should be considered a documentary. Actually, the book on which it was based was a (mostly) serious take that Hollywood turned into a joke.

Even within a group of siblings, there are generational differences.  Coming of age in the late 70s vs the late 80s early 90s was a stark cultural difference.  One of the biggest was the mass movement of women into the workforce in the 1970s.

                Also First Stage Boomers were Presidents Bill Clinton and GW Bush, born in 1946.. VP Gore was a year younger, c. 1947 birth, I think. Joe Biden is what mymother would call a War Baby, so is John Kerry, and so am I. My March 1945 birthday was just a month before Pres FDR passed away and my freshman year in college was indelibly marked with JFK’s assassination. So, I have been incredibly grateful all my long life that my childhood thru teen yrs was such a blast. The future looked bright. Communism was a bad thing but shocked us with their success when we were in Jr High when the USSR sent up Sputnik. We all put on our big girl and boy pants to catch, then beat the Russians to the moon a few yrs later. Before that took place, however, while still in high school, I cut school with a couple of girlfriends, took the train to NYC, and watched the parade on Fifth Avenue with Astronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth in space, riding in an open car with VP LBJ. All seemed to be going well at that point;-)

                                Dosing up on morphine and the like for terminal cancer patients is as old as modern medicine yes. The difference is that MAID is being streamlined in Canada, as I understand it is being talked about almost like a form of therapy. And it has been used, or at least suggested, for cases such as depression and PTSD. I’ve even heard rumors of it as “treatment” for homelessness.What’s more, this is part of a pattern. Modern managerials in the West have a profoundly disturbing fascination with death.My position is that actual euthanasia should be completely banned. Same with executions. This is not because I’m against them on principal grounds. In fact I’m not. It is recognition of two deplorable facts: the culture is deeply sick. And, the sanest people, dissidents who can see and sense how bad things are, are systematically being prevented from holding high office. This is not the time to trust the system. About anything, and certainly not about life and death. Give me a healthy culture and I am all for looking at options for end of life care and for firing up old sparky for the Ted Bundys of the world. But don’t trust the system as it is today.

                        This is one of the many ways they turn our virtue into a vice.  There are certain very specific circumstances where I support a right to die in dignity and not in horrific pain or doped up on IV morphine.Like you have an 85 year old with stage 4 cancer, can’t get out of bed and is in horrible pain and has 3 months to live. I have so much sympathy for such a person.  Sadly, you give an inch and they will take a mile.  You approve the above person making the decision to check out and the next thing you know, 19 years olds who say they are depressed are meeting Dr Kevorkian.

                                You have to wonder to what degree this is caused by the army of (((ambulance chasers))) and medical fraud we have in the US.  Indians are well known for the medical fraud, though they aren’t the only ones. Every lawsuit involves 10s of thousands of Dollars in fraudulent medical care.  All the aliens from Central and South America in the hospitals running up all of our bills.
The whole medical industry is plagued with grift.

                                “The rest of the developed world spends ~10% with better results.”First, you’re talking Western world. Second, you need to define “better results”. Certainly, ability to obtain medical care quickly and efficiently is a societal good.  But is that always the case?Having recently had a bad situation that required more than a GP, I investigated such treatment in GB (NHS) during my research into the disease and the current best treatment/diagnostic recommendations published—one article even published in the BJM.Seems like they have their problems there as well.  The basis of such being denial of treatment via long waits for visits to specialists, diagnostic evaluation, and scheduling of hospitalization and surgery.  Or are all those posting the horrors of their experience under the NHS and lost loved ones to be discarded?In any event, “better” is in the “eye of the beholder” as they say.  Most people under a national health care system seem extremely satisfied (IMHO) with their national health care for minor treatment conditions like a broken leg, or a visit for a seasonal bout of flu.  Other, more complex treatments, I’m not convinced.  These are the ones that cost the big bucks, return very little value wrt a societal cost/benefit calculation.Now I’m sympathetic as a tax payer to such analysis—but not to restriction of treatment because of such analysis.  Seems every time the US explores/proposes a national health care system, it also includes a restriction to such treatment—especially those deemed end-of-life—In one form or another, often very subtlety expressed in the “small print”.Clintons first proposed bill had section after section that threatened fines and imprisonment for going “out of system” for treatment. I myself would look more benignly on a two tier system, where the government provides a baseline of medical care and a possibility of those desiring such an option for “extended” care.

                                    Britain has a private healthcare system as well. There are health insurance schemes and private hospitals.BUPA is one of the larger providers.Most  NHS professors have a private practice .
Medical malpractice is not particular to the UK as can be inferred by the horror stories about US medicine. Waiting times are also not an issue solely for the Europeans if you include the Americans who choose not to have treatment because they can’t afford it.

                Hillary’s VP had the authentic Gen X inauthenticity. Never checked his age, but his persona seemed crafted by a middle aged career woman who thought she’s still cool because in 1988 some guy left his Soul Asylum tape in her car stereo and she listened to the rest of that side, so when they got famous she was anold fan. It’s why nobody remembered him, even when he was still around.“Beto” is built to mine that strip too (while pretending to be Mexican). There’s nothing there.Walz ismillennial Twitter harpy asboomer commercial dad. Nothing about him is age-appropriate. Without checking I’d guess that young women love him, because to me he seemsprecisely“icky.”

        I was born in 1964, so I’m old enough to remember how prosperous it used to be in the Mid Ohio Valley. There were 2 integrated steel mills within a half hours drive; we had the C&amp;O railroad and the biggest single rail terminal in the Western World just down the road as well. There were 2 oil refineries, glass factories, and just up the river they made rail cars. There were so many opportunities for a young man .Then in the early 1970s it began to whither away, and now it’s all gone, and the only news this area makes are the drugs and poverty.All of this talk about the different generations and their capabilities is useless because everyone in this country is about to eat sh!t and die.It doesn’t matter what generation you’re in when you realize this whole shebang is about to utterly collapse. I can only hope we don’t go out in a blazing civil war, but I doubt America will die as peacefully as the Soviet Union did in 1991. The many weak are not going to get to the other side, and I doubt the latest generation has the brains or the know how to put it back together again. Many parents over the last 30 years or so have really done a shitty job of raising their children, which is why they are what they are.The weak will die, and the strong will survive. This discussion of Boomers, Gen x, Millenials; etc, is really pointless. The future will not be an event anyone will have fond memories of.

                When that fiat greenback approaches zero, that $50/gal of gasoline will seem cheap. Everything sold in this country is Made In China. The collapse will be due to the inability to buy the junk and the parts to maintain it, and that is EVERYTHING.

        Trump is a man with the Baby Boomer sensibilities
I have thought about this many times over the years. Events of recent years have probably disabused him to some extent, but I think that in his bones Trump still believes too much in his bones in what he learned in fifties-era civics class to ever be the American Pinochet the left imagines him to be. That will have to come from someone younger, who has been more disillusioned from a younger age.

            A very good insight.  Same problem I experience.  I grew up in a different time and hence country.  Hard to shake those formative years.  You’d not want me to lead a revolution as I carry too much baggage and oft times my mind is in that other world.  Best the least knowledgeable of those years leads the way as those times will never be recoverable and therefore a possible hinderance to creation of a renewed society based on new ideas and virtues fitting of the times and needs.

            I think there’s a very real possibility that’s the case.  Here’s an article pointing out that Nikki Haley wasn’t really eligible to be President either under the “natural-born citizen” clause.
https://amgreatness.com/2024/01/01/the-constitution-absolutely-prohibits-nikki-haley-from-being-president-or-vice-president/
The definition’s a little unclear but apparently the term was meant to imply American citizens born to American citizens and not anchor babies like Nimrata and Kamalatoe.

            McCain was born out of the US. I don’t believe the issue has ever been fully adjudicated, but jus sanguinis would seem to cover the subject. Now, I don’t disagree with your point – but I would point to a certain Barry as proving this is a decided issue.But then again, the governor of Hawaii swore he know of His (sic) birth.

                The issue with McCain and Haley are different.  A nature born citizen is one born upon American soil or soil controlled by America such as the “Canal Zone”.Therefore, under this interpretation, McCain was eligible for the Presidency, Haley not.  Haley, like Cruz, are citizens who were “naturalized” through one or more of their parents.  When a citizen has a child overseas, she/he merely goes to the nearest embassy and has it recorded.  They then issue a passport for the child.  I still have my mother’s passport when I was a baby.  In those days, they simply took a picture of her and me sitting on her lap and it had two names in it—hers and mine.None of this is to imply that SCOTUS will ever rule against such Presidential candidates as Haley and Cruz should they run for the highest office.  SCOTUS makes/changes Constitutional law with impunity.

                    I posted before the Haley issue was concerned. Haley was born in the US, just like Harris (supposedly) was. Of course, the anchor baby should have no right to citizenship, but it is what it is. She is absolutely qualified, or am I missing something?To be clear, I believe anchor baby is insanity. But am I missing something else about Haley? She was born, thus natural-born, here.

                        No. “I” did not investigate Haley, but based my response upon RDittmar comment and *assumed* Haley was born outside US territory or some such thing.  My apologies to the group.  I usually research the original comment.  Indeed, if you drop out upon US territory, you are eligible to run for the office.  It matters not who your parents were except…
This might be reconsidered/challenged against, say, foreign diplomats and their foreign spouses who are not considered under the jurisdiction of the US given diplomatic immunity and such things.

                Who will answer the question: did Kamala’s mother become a Canadian citizen? If so, did that transfer that citizenship to Kamala and her sister? From what I’ve read about the mother it seems like she was very bright and ambitious, got a good job in Canada. Did she stay there after Kamala went off to college at Howard U. in DC? Was Kamala registered as a foreign student at Howard? Sounds like Obama at Occidental. No records released in his case, either.Same kind of muddying the waters of the US Constitution’s requirement that the presidential candidate shall be a “Natural-born citizen.” Not clear to me if that means that BOTH parents need to be US citizens. Can they be Naturalized to have their offspring be considered “Natural Born”? Sort of the same mess as the situation that occurred with Sen. Ted Cruz in his run for President in 2016.From long-time San Franciscan family members I learned years’ ago that Hastings Law School (Kamala’s) is the lesser of the two law institutions, the other one formerly named Boalt Hall, which was “de-named” in recent years as 19th c. John Boalt was anti-Chinese immigrant! There’s a picture of some guy on a ladder with a chisel removing the offending name from the entrance! Now the place is just U-C Berkeley LS. Talk about deeply WOKE institutions!

                    The logic as explained to me seemed simple, but I’m not a Constitutional scholar. If you drop out on US soil, you’re “born a citizen”. (Seems like most countries do not do this.). Same with Canada as Ted Cruz showed us when running for the Presidential nomination. He was a dual citizen and, when that became a potential problem in the eyes of opponents, he made great effort to reject formally his Canadian citizenship to Canada in writing.So what other classes of citizen are recognized? Well, there are those immigrants who receive residency and 5+ years later apply for “naturalization” or conferred citizenship. Such was my father. If they have foreign born, under-age children, they can be naturalized through their now citizen parents.So now we have two classes of citizen: born citizens and naturalized citizens. Is there a third type? Not that I can see. Then why does the Constitution speak to “…natural born citizens…”? The Founders were experts of the English language and would never use a redundant or at that time confusing phrasing in their wording of the Document—would they? Well they did, sort of, but that was not their fault.The Founders used the term “natural” to describe the commonly accepted understanding of citizenship—birth upon native soil—whereas the government now uses the term “naturalization” as the process of formally bestowing citizenship upon an immigrant.Immigration as we now understand it was really pretty vague until the early 1800’s and then began to form as the country grew. Open borders were the thing when our Founders wrote the Constitution and naturalization simply did not exist. The Founders however were definitely against any foreign influence attaining the highest office in the land, hence they wanted the President to definitely be born and raised in the USA and inculcated with those societal values of the time.So Cruz is not eligible to be president as he was naturalized and McCain was as he was born on American controlled soil—iff you are a proponent of “Original Intent” interpretation as Justice Scalia was noted for. If you believe the Constitution is a “living document” and worse, America is just a “idea”, then you probably don’t particularly care who obtains the highest office in the land or where they were raised in their formative years.We seem to have this new concept being enacted in local jurisdictions of States and cities. IA’s are being allowed the franchise for better or worse and new arrivals can vote themselves access to the “public purse” via that vote. Native born citizens can pound sand as they say.“Is this a great country—or what?” Yakov Smirnoff.

                Bear in mind I’m Canadian. The few times I’ve heard Harris speak about American values even I cringe. She talks like she’s not learned anything since Canadian high school and how she was chosen to surf her way to this position baffles me. But then we are governed by her commie classmates here federally and are suffering because of it.

                That’s the anchor baby thing again. We have *millions* of them thanks to our open borders. Years ago, MX women crossed the border—legally, when in labor—to “drop one off” on American soil and take home baby and birth certificate. We tried here, and I believe elsewhere, to prohibit the issuing of birth certificates to such people, but the Fed’s blocked those laws.

        I have a little hope for the future. The Jolly Heretic often talks about the general lowering of IQ. And how as a result, politics becomes less gentlemanly and more punitive. Like jailing opponents, etc, as we’re starting to see now.Anecdotal evidence suggests that, as in every other era, the younger generations are more leftist, so they always have the numbers in that demographic. But of the ones who are political, on what we call the left or right, are more strident and less gentlemanly about it. So we’re going to get our outrageously retarded leftists, but also our based rightists who may or may not also cite crime statistics in nationally-televised debates, to the delight or shame of everyone watching. Vance gave us a peek at this, as he spoke of “people in inner cities” having access to guns.The good news is that as people get older, they generally get more conservative, as these new conservatives will be well-aware of the crime statistics, among other noticings, as opposed to the old conservatives now, who have their fingers stuck in their ears as they hum a tune by Steely Dan.

        “This is the main reason the system hates Trump; he betrayed his class….”I might quibble, Z – before shuffling off the the shuffleboards! (If I EVER get my hands on you, or your creepy jewish black homosexual brother – Cornelius Rye – you’ll get the very HELL of it!) And stay off the bloody grass!!!Trump is a business man. Part business exec, part sales professional, part grifter and showman. Elon Musk is much the same. Both men are driven machines to seek out opportunity and exploit it. Trump has more in common with the working man than he does with “his class”. Most of them were hand picked by our overlords, and installed into their positions. They come from established crime families and old money and pay bums like Harris and Walz to do the dirty work of managing the peasantry. Trump and Elon do it themselves. Let us give the Devil his due.I fear that we have become so blackpilled, curmudgeonly and skeptical that if a real hero or savior presented himself to us – we’d tear him to shreds, accusing him of being a fed, or a jew, or some other unsavory villain. Would a dissident even know a real hero if he saw one?Not trying to be a dink…and not saying that Trump, JD, or Elon are heroes… but as soft men create ever worsening times… there comes a point in the cycle when the hard men and heroes arise.You’re up, Dissident. As Z’s other little buddy likes to say… the future belongs to you. You have my sincere sympathies and condolences.Tomorrow Belongs to Me – Cabaret (youtube.com)Gawd, I miss that kid on the Friday show…  🙂

        The power of the Boomers is like that of the undead; seemingly immortal. As a child of the 80s I naively thought a stake had been driven through their hippie hearts with Reagan’s 49 state win and the kids liking Alex P. Keaton instead of his hippy-dippy parents. Finally, we were going to send the Beatles and Woodstock and Hendrix back to hell! We like Journey, Survivor, and REO Speedwagon, godammit!But no! It’s the 80s that got flushed down the memory hole and since the 90s it was boomers resurrected stronger than ever! Still woodstock, still beatles, s still peace and free love, man, etc.

            Unfortunately. I like late 80’s club music (Yeah I know this makes me lame). But that has definitely gone down the memory hole. Same for the early 80’s “new wave” (Martha Quinn MTV) music. We still have to hear that gawdawful 70’s music.

            That book has always rubbed me the wrong way.  His grandmother supposedly set his grandfather on fire for coming home drunk.  WHY is that story in the book? It happened long before he was born.
It’s one thing to hide from this kind of thing.  It’s quite another to put it on display. It’s not even part of his story.

                Same. It was billed as a great far-right novel but came off as hick-hating poverty porn. Also, it’s poorly and rather impersonally written – boring most of all. Back then, Vance wasn’t a name in politics, but considering him being groomed by the neocons and what followed since, I now suspect it’s ghost written.Also, and I’m not going to stop mentioning this, Vance wears eyeliner – probably his wife’s kohl. That negates anything based the guy has ever done or said.You want hillbilly porn? Read some of Joe Bageant’s West Virginia old columns, they’ve got a lot more of an authentic atmosphere. Elegy comes across as having been written by a guy who never lived the hillbilly life himself.

He didn’t. He lived in working-class Ohio with his white trash mother and then his grandmother after they had moved out of Kentucky. So he wasn’t actually in the hollers with the ‘billies, but still had to deal with the white trash ways of his relatives.

            Hillbilly Elegy was planned like everything else in Vance’s life (I say this with respect). The guy who got into Yale using a plausibly Jewish surname knew exactly how the liberal literary world would react to a tale of supposed condescension and woe aimed at rural Whites.In reality the story was more sympathetic, but that didn’t stop the gleeful hand-rubbing. Vance played the game for a while, even to making the obligatory Trump denunciation when it looked like he was still a joke. But then he and his near-elite sponsors in venture and tech realized Trump was on to something, and the former hick from the sticks became their vehicle for elite replacement.From a Machiavellian perspective, I stand in awe.

        Who TH decreed that 1946-64 is the Boomer generation and why do dissidents go along with it? Strauss and Howe were closer to the mark with their 1943-60 range but personally I think it’s just as accurate to go by decades. A lot easier to remember for one thing and also one can identify the two halves and any differences by decades. The great majority of musicians who performed at Woodstock were born 1940-45. Am I really supposed to believe that they were Silents playing for Boomers?Brandon’s simplified generations:Born in:Greatest		’00’s-10’sSilents			’20’s-30’sBoomers		’40’s-50’sX					’60’s-70’sMillennials	’80’s-90’sZoomers		’00’s-10’sAs one born in 1959 I reluctantly group myself in the Boomers although my sensibilities are at least as much X.Of course this is a generalization with soft, flexible boundaries, as are all the generational concepts.

        This is like a detailed analysis of the gang in the Mystery Machine.Shaggy, you see, was just a hippie slacker whose only policies were limits on hits between passes, and tireless advocacy for Salt and Vinegar chips to alleviate the munchies. Velma, on the other hand, had her nose stuck in a book since the time she could crawl. Her exhaustive  knowledge of subjects ranging from Botany to Phrenology gave her the intellectual edge to crush Shaggy in their debates about the amount of wood a woodchuck could potentially chuck while the Gang were idling in the Sambo’s parking lot.She won because she worked so hard, you see, andnotbecause she bowed the knee to the people (many of whom are found congregating around Influence Nodes such as Harvard) who arereallyin charge of things. Pure merit. No question.Daphne was so rich and cultured that viewers clad in their Underoos  could not relate to her Chivas and Caviar messaging, and so she was left in a strange sort of isolation while Velma did all the heavy lifting.Now, everybody fervently believes the last election for Class President was stolen by Hong Kong Phooey. There is no question aboutthat.Still. How about that Velma, eh guys? Eh? She’s such a threat to H.Y.D.R.A. that they cannot possibly allow her to win!In the next exciting episode, Velma will marry Fat Albert and squeeze out a couple of mulatto chirrens. So glad Velma’s on my team, aren’t you?! I mean, otherwise we’ll just be bred out of existence by and by.But not before our Wise Velmas own the Libs one last time!

            But you see, Velma actually DID do most of the work solving those many mysteries (with assistance from Scooby), while the rest of the crew pretty much just ran around looking scared.
So, your example is flawed. Flawed, I say! Plus, those knees…

        “Trump is not technically a Baby Boomer, but he is a man with the Baby Boomer sensibilities. He is a guy who thinks the economy is the country …”Ironically, it’s the same reason that some good-faith never-Trumpers (yes, they do exist) hate President Trump. They think that a nation is just an economic subdivision and that human beings are just economic production units. They have no use for patriotism, family, loyalty, or morality; instead, everything is about someone’s financial bottom line.The other day, a never-Trumper who I know personally was ranting that the people of Springfield, Ohio  should be grateful for the army of Haitians bestowed on them by the benevolent DC regime and its NGO allies. He really believes it. I am aghast.

        Left unsaid is that Vance ran for senator because someone(s) in the state wanted him to be senator which is, perhaps, evenmoreinteresting as it says something about what those powerful people think of the system.

            Vance is a striver who is being mugged by reality, but the mugging isn’t over yet. His origins remind me of John Galt in “Atlas Shrugged” (butremember that JG sabotaged the USA to get his hands on the power companies’ distribution networks.) Vance seems to be rising above the mentality of the prideful opportunist who’s obsessed with grabbing everything he can as fast as he can.Read “Hillbilly Elegy”. The pages turn themselves. JDV reveals a tremendous amount about his own low origins and upbringing. There’s considerable historical detail, too, in there about the region he’s from and the people who’ve lived there.

                I agree. Vance was a smart but poor kid who wanted to get out and succeed. He followed the path but discovered that the managerial class and its rewards didn’t quite do it for him – though I’m sure that he like the money that he already has. A lot of us who come from nowhere towns and reach some success (not his level but some) find that we never quite feel at home with the country club crowd.Ironically, the country club people that I’ve known (I’m not a member, just know them through other venues) have generally been nice and welcoming, not like the stereotype. But there’s just something off. I never feel quite at home with them. Maybe I’m projecting, but I suspect that Vance is the same way.There’s also the fact that Vance probably realized early that he wasn’t a member of the tribe so he’d never get a seat at the big table.

                    Cc members usu. have monthly or annual spending requirements in addition to the initiation fee and annual fee. This can make them resentful about anything less than servile obedience from the staff. Also the expense alone restricts the number and types of people who can become members, which removes oxygen from the rooms indoors and reduces persepctives and worldviews. Some wealthy people find that type of environment suffocating, so they stay away, further narrowing persepctives and shortening horizons.I interacted with many cc members during my days of caddying at a private, expensive club during Reagan’s presidency.  Women were prohibited from having early tee times on weekends and holy days like the 4th of July since they play so slowly. So far, so good, but members were a mixed bag. Tips were almost always inversely proportional to the golfer’s petulance.The best way for a caddy to have a good Saturday was to carry doubles in the morning and get another round in the afternoon with a good golfer, preferablly a regular who requested you. This could be an ordeal if in the morning you got stuck with some duffers whose bags had the maximum number of allowed clubs, the newest fad club in their bags, umbrella, telescoping ball retriever, and enough golf balls stuffed into the pockets to supply a foursome for 18 holes. Too many had little consideration for the caddies, which were required during certain hours. I think they often resented our presence at the club whichtheyhad joined voluntarily knowing the rules in advance and the unwashed people hired to do most of the labor.

        The issues of Elon Musk, former generous Obama and Biden donor, and JD Vance, should scare the hell out of the Uniparty. That it does not, speaks to their senility and isolation.White men of ambition have no place, none at all, in the Uniparty, or in business, or the military, or anything. This is female driven Mean Girls exclusion driven to the insane but inevitable outcome. It is like Entertainment. The Joker movie made over a billion in revenue. On a budget of about 70 million. Naturally Warners spent over $250 million in production alone to make an “own the incels” sequel starring Lady Gaga. The leaders of studios don’t even want to make money, its not as if they get to share in it anyway. Otherwise you’d see “Incel-splotation” like the Blacksploitation movies of the 70s. To make money. It is ALL about social positioning in an ever decreasing ruling elite, that is getting older and will not admit talented White men into power and influence.If the system was working, both Vance and Musk would be out campaigning for it, and thus Harris. It is not. AT BEST the system can offer only neglect of White people. At its worst, the deliberate witholding of aid, helicopters, etc. in North Carolina in order to kill as many White people as possible. After the Haiti earthquate, the 82 Airborne was in Haiti within 48 hours. Now, a few hundred miles from places like Asheville, they are mobilizing … to deploy to Cyprus to protect Israel. Harris offered $750 per person one time, while doling out at $2,500 a month to Haitians and probably more like $9,000 a month (they are all driving new Honda Odyssey vans, where do they get the money?)That trickles up to elites too, as you are seeing the result of ambition thwarted.

The fact that he walked away from that system into the populist revolt
i don’t get this. Vance seems to just be managerializing the populist revolt. There was some dumb movie in the 80s where Chong or cheech dropped out in the jungles of South America and returned to the states to find their 60s “revolution “ to be turned into a brand. That’s what “jd” (yo, jd…still sounds weird to me. Wonder if ootra or oopie or whatever his wife’s name is calls him “jd”) reminds me of.

                Exactly. People dismiss THE LOTUS EATERS as British Normie Conservatards, which actually has a lot of merit, but sometimes the podcast is really insightful. Carl Benjamin had Ed Dutton on as a guest very recently and they discussed the outlines of the very phenomenon you described here. They noted the Dissident Right started with aggressive, disorganized outliers, then attracted Big Brain folks, and when the smart fraction gave it a structure and a future, women joined and are in the normal process of becoming strident advocates. As the show noted, the dissent had been there for generations but social media allowed the evolution you described to take place.Vance certainly is an opportunist who fits the profile you described, but he represents a big political shift despite his personal ambition. I don’t think at all electoral politics can save the West but a less hostile environment could make the transition to what comes next easier. We should welcome that.

        “One final angle here. J.D. Vance is the full expression of managerial man. The fact that he walked away from that system into the populist revolt against it suggest thatmanagerialism lacks the cultural fulfillment to sustain itself.”But managerialism is a very large and powerful system, a fat pipeline to power for a particular kind of talent and ambition.  It needs no “cultural fulfillment” to go on as a system. Individuals may come to feel shorted by the system, but so long as it exists, it’ll have willing recruits coming in at the low-power end.  And as long as nothing changes in the framework surrounding it and supporting it, managerialism as a system of government will continue indefinitely.Where am I wrong?

            You have hinted strongly at a reason why a much better religion is needed to defeat and replace managerialism—and neo-liberalism, Anglo-American imperialism, Israelism, scientism, and globalist unipolarism. (Am I being reduntant here?) Without a proper religion, people are like lost little atoms waiting to be collectivized and degraded into the condition of farm animals, as were Evropean Americans during and after the War of Secession and Yankee Vindictiveness.Many Christians have critiqued those problems, but they operate from a position of epistological skepticism which they have in common with so-called post-modernists. (Notice however that some PM’s flip this skepticism on its head to construe theirselves as infallible gods, more or less. Bc “all ways are worthy of reverence”, as a female biology teacher told me.) So Christians can’t to defeat that mess of problems, esp. the hateful antirationalism of Israelism, which is the foundation of their own religion(s).It appears that the PM’s control most schools throughout the West. Yet ironically they enjoy the favor of conservatards,productivistswho are likewise an important pathogen responsible for the aggressive cancer called “Western” civilization. Eliminating all state schools is part of the answer here, but the managerialists, neoliberals, Israelists, and so on won’t let that happen without an epic struggle.Now, given what I regard to be self-evident, why is there so little attention paid on this blog to the rearing of children and the educations which they ought to receive?

Most Xers that have effectively bypassed or broken through this jam have adopted very Boomerish attitudes.

                Hear, hear. I was four years old during Woodstock, five when the Kent State shooting happened. I wasn’t alive when Kennedy was shot. All those cultural touchstones of the Boomers meant nothing to me.
Consequently I was amazed at how many of my college cohort of the ’80s adopted the hippie/Boomer culture — the weed, the hair, the tie-dyes. Some didn’t and became Yuppies, of course. Some were hippies during undergrad and Yuppies after graduation…

                In my country, there was a regime change in 1975. We went from dictatorship to democracy. Boomers started ruling in 1975, in their twenties and forties (the old generation was not democratic) and stayed in power until their eighties (for example, for the Prime Minister position). I have seen the same in all the countries I have lived, even without regime change.People like me (born in 1970), Generation X, have been deprived of the best positions all our lives because these positions were for the Boomers. Now, that the Boomers are retiring, we are passed by in favor of Millennials (Boomer’s kids) who are mostly useless people.We have gone from “it’s not still your time” to “your time has passed” instantly. From “too young” to “too old”. We never were in the middle. There was never “our time”.I put myself as an example, but this is not personal. I have an amazing CV, a PhD in IT, two masters, fluency in four languages, workaholic, etc. I have had good jobs but not the best jobs and I have seen people that are much worse than me having the best jobs, both the Boomer who does not know how to flip a PDF and the Millennial who has an empty head and no work ethic.It’s not personal. It’s our generation. A cursed generation. From young know-nothings to old farts.

        Our youngest millennial son can confirm the females of his generation are both semi-hysterical and typically on one or two prescription medications – and not for a runny nose or zits…  One can only hope they wrest the reins from the doddering boomer cat ladies and their compliant husbands before it’s too late.

        Reading the article, I am reminded of a movie trope called “Mary Sue”. I was turned onto it with the Star Wars reboot and the main character is someone who did not train, or know about the force, but was incredibly adept at it. Kamala is a fric*ing Mary Sue. So many wish it…

        Ohio State’s Main Campus is pretty tough to get into these days. It’s not quite Michigan, but it’s a half-step behind maybe, which is pretty good. When I went there it used to be a party and football school. (OSU’s graduate programs and research were always the best in the state, but OSU had open enrollment for undergrad. They would take anybody with a heartbeat.)There is still a back door to get into Ohio State by attending a branch campus your first year or going to a community college and transferring your credits. But if you want the whole Buckeye experience on Main Campus, you have to be a pretty good student these days.

        What’s weird is a quick google ai search (and I never asked for ai, google just gifted it to me) says that boomer gen was 71 million and gen x was 63 million. I was expecting gen. X to be much smaller AND consider that for whatever reason boomers cover 20 years while xers cover only 15. Kinda makes the size diff not so stark .
but xers were competing with more females it seems less boomer females than I thought worked. So men were competing with more tiny noses than boomers or the silent gen.

            That is a nonsense result. It is why I hate generation talk. It devolves into a debate over the calendar. “Well axshully, if you were bort in June of 1964 you are a boomer but if you were born in July you are Gen-X.”

        ” Trump is not technically a Baby Boomer.”
Trump was born June 14,146.  People born between 1946 and 1964 are commonly labelled BB’s.
I don’t know what you mean by “technically” in this context.
