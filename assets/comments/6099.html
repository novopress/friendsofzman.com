        “In the Clinton years the Democrats went from being the majority party to the minority party. From 1994 onward, the party was in a steady retreat politically and ideologically.”I’d say that’s true only in the most limited sense. The Democratic Party was in retreat because it had thoroughly co-opted the Republican Party leadership, culminating a process that had begun with FDR’s vanquishing of Herbert Hoover. Ever since the depression, the Republicans have simply been the Democrats on a 30-year time delay. By 1994 the transformation of the Republican Party was pretty much complete and the Democrats, having essentially gotten ideological control of the Republican Party (and completely controlling its leadership once Newt Gingrich was driven out of office), didn’t really even need it’s own party base any more.

        […] The Left collapsed as an intellectual movement when the Cold War ended, but the Right collapsed as a pragmatic alternative. You can’t have one without the other. In a single generation, the Left has adopted the economics of the Right and the Right has adopted the politics of the Left. Neither side has a reason to exist outside of naked greed.    Keep Reading…. […]

        There is too much talk of “capitalism” when the term should be “CRONY capitalism”. This is also a stage in the plans and goals of “Fabian socialism”.National and international socialism are the same thing: a cloak of sheep’s clothing that covers the wolf. The wolf is the global dictatorship that the very topmost one-tenth of one-percenters are planning.They consider themselves a “natural” ruling class and their eventual goal is serfdom for us, lordship for themselves. There must be varying degrees of awareness among them of this end-game. George Soros is the most visible example of the contradiction between word and action.In the words of one friend who spent six years in Moscow before and after the “dissolution” of the Soviet Union, “There is no such thing as socialism”. The oligarchs live in their mansions, they have their summer homes. Poor Gorbachev “suffered” much, he told Diane Sawyer, when he was under “house arrest” in his home in the southern latitudes of Russia. Yeah, right.He also told the Chicago commodities traders in a speech shortly after “If you think socialism is dead, you have another thing coming”.

        It is a mistake to think communism ever died, or could die. It’s host will die because the virus is deadly, but the virus will find new life in a healthy host. “Socialism” is instinctive. The extended order of civilization is entirely anti-instinctual. The extended order is guided by an invisible hand, not easily explained; instinct requires no explanation. The hand had a long run, surprisingly long.Garet GarretThe shivering ghost that now inhabits the words laissez faire was once an unconquerable fighting spirit. It did not belong to capitalism. It belonged to liberty; and to this day its association with capitalism is valid only insofar as capitalism represents liberty.

            Communism: I am oft-reminded of the fact that when eastern European communism collapsed, the people who were the party faithful and its loyal servants went to bed the night it all fell down and the next morning got up, put on a different tie and went to work as usual.
Nothing for them changed other than the colour of the tie they were wearing, so it is indeed foolish to think Communism ended.

        Give the politically correct enough power and they will bring on full blown communism, bringing the house down on everyone, including on their wealthy benefactors. This would be unavoidable. There’s no need to be overly struck by the extent to which the left appears to have the same economic principles as the right. Just like freedom of speech, it’s just the tracks they move on until it’s no longer needed. Then the tracks are blown up. They talked up free speech when they needed it. Now free speech is considered a hate-crime. Capitalism will go the way of free speech once they have enough power and none of the wealthy who support them will be able to speak against the process.

Caesarism, baby!  It’s the new hotness of the twenty-teens.  It looks like constitutional government; it’s actually organized plunder by warlords and their retinues.  Our bread and circuses are much better though.

        Progressivism is in its death throes as an ideology because it has no where else to go. There are no new ideas with which to hoodwink the ignorant and/or gullible. Leftism Jumped the Shark, although I’d be hard pressed to say when exactly it happened.I disagree that ideological Marxism collapsed in the 1990s. Maybe state-sponsored Marxism did, but the Marxists won on so many levels in the US that your average person doesn’t see it because it’s become part of the “accepted thought”. The “long march” of the Left through every public institution, and many private ones, is complete. The Marxists knew from the beginning that if you control the education systems you are able to mold thought, influence culture, create little hive-minded creatures with no critical thinking skills to speak of.Also, I disagree that Soros is a capitalist. He is an oligarch, using global mercantilism to enrich himself and advance his sociocultural agenda. He is an Evil Spider, spinning his webs behind the scenes, with a deep and abiding malice for Western Civilization.Not easy to see what will replace the insidious socialist thought that’s overtaken much of our country. Could go the Revolution route, or we could just all slouch toward fascism. Perhaps a benevolent dictator? God help us!

            The West, most specifically USA, became POST-capitalist after the Fed was established with the law passed in stealth mode on Christmas Eve when the smart ones were gone. It became a serfdom of central bankers with Nixon’s breaking of the Bretton Woods agreement.
So now there is no pure capitalist society in the world. It is now immersed in CRONY capitalism.

        You talk of banners, Z, and it is an interesting phenomena that people are more willing than ever before to display their feelings. It has emerged, in my lifetime thus far, people are considerably less likely to be content in living within themselves. There is no inner journey, other than as a jumping off stage to get one’s opinion out there and on show in public.The banner, like tattoos or face piercings or infantile clothes or large earphones (so everyone can see you are listening to music rather than being aware of the world around you) is an outward show. For many people these days one cannot exist unless you are on show. Muslims do it, for example, by hiding their women and wearing desert-style clothes in places like northern Europe. Their public show, their banner, is their supposed piety via clothing. It’s just another ‘my-social-circle-approved’ way to say “look at me, look how I think.”Thoughts aren’t inner events now. You only have to glance at social media to see everything, every twitch and hiccup, all made public.I have a relative by marriage who, being young and facebooky publishes pictures of herself on marches against nasty capitalism (a capitalism incidentally that pays her and her husband very well indeed for performing ‘tasks’ that didn’t exist twenty years ago and contribute nothing but amusements and diversions for others.) She joins these marches because she has time, lives in London with numerous public transport options and better still has an opportunity to advertise her deeply held views that your life in the 21st century is junk unless we collectively do this or that at once. But what strikes me if I see these pictures is that there is always a mate there who has his ever-ready “End Racism Now” sign.No matter what the cause, the ‘reason’ for the protest, he stamps his world-view in a ready made sign. You may think that either he has no other thoughts, or at least that he is willing to make public, or that racism is the cornerstone of all ills and tragedies and deprivations. He may be right, but he is there, grinning for the camera, sign held proudly aloft and confident it will not be rejected among all the banners demanding either better housing, importing more refugees or stopping the search for shale oil and gas.We are the age of the heart on sleeve, and the pinnacle of our literary greatness is a man can write “End Racism Now” on a board nailed to a stick.

            Trump could be if the trends in Europe are indications of the future, but Sanders like Webb is a relic of a previous democratic party. Perhaps the future is the PRI era of Mexico, party men presiding over term limited bouts of looting.
