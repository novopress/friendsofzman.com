        There are reports that HRC had her staff removed security level headings from emails stored on her server. Removal of statements like “Top Secret”.I guess this was a double-sure system for avoiding blame. She intended to delete all such data, but also wanted plausible denyability if any of those emails were recovered from others.In fact, she is making those denials, that she didnt receive or send on her server any information marked with a security restriction.But, this is an admission of guilt in the intent to mishandle secure information. What could be worse than to intentionally misclassify data when storing it on an insecure system? HRC did not simply handle secure information in an unknowing or sloppy way. She changed the titles to hide what she was doing. Why is this different from espionage?

        It’s simple. The Clinton Crime Family is a highly influential lobbying firm posing as a non profit. Why do you need intelligence when your customers seek you out? Arrogance and stupidity seem a better fit to the facts we know.What strikes me as foolishness on steroids is the amateur execution. She had the resources to hire the best in the biz to put this together. Did she just cheap out or was there a fear that you couldn’t put this project in the hands of a disinterested third party expert? (They’ll see the Big Board!)

            That’s always a possibility. One of the recurring themes with Hillary is she cooks up elaborate schemes and then gets exposed via some ham-handed unforced error. There were better ways of handling so that when it was revealed, she could have a story that was not so silly. The Clintons seem to like getting caught and then wriggling out of the jam. It’s as if they have some sort of death wish that plays out through scandal.

        Great insight, Zman! Best explanation I have heard or read yet as to why she would do this. Shakedown, on a global scale. If true, this would make Jesse Jackson’s despciable shakedowns seem like small town thuggery. I for one would be stunned if the Feds bring charges against Swillary and actually make them stick. After all, she learned from the best teflon character there is, her husband, the orignal Slick Willy.

        Don’t bet that Hillary won’t do down on this one.  The FBI and the Department of Justice will look at this as getting their credibility back.
Clearly we haven’t had any since Berry moved into the White House.

        Everything you said is most likely true.  However hrc will never face the consequences for her actions.  The imperials always get away with their nefarious deeds.  There  are many reasons for her actions but always self promotion and self aggrandizement are at the root of all Clinton Inc. operations.  The really sad part is that they are so transparent, everyone knows who they are and what they do and still it continues, perhaps to another Clinton Inc. presidency.  Where are the patriots?

        “If that sounds outlandish, remember that these are the same people who green-lighted the sale of satellite technology to China for campaign cash.
This is something that its almost forgotten, Bill selled satellite technology to China without suffering any consequences, maybe this isn’t a problem because the US has to use Russian rockets to go to space.
