        It is as hard to believe that the English, French, Germans and others were once real, tough men as to believe that dinosaurs once walked the earth. The record tells us that it was once so but it is damn hard to believe. This is not anti European btw. There is nothing I wish more than for them to become men again. And before it is too late which it may already be

            As an Englishman I agree completely.I guess our elites used to be strong and ruthless but we have allowed the cancer of wimmin to get their manicured hands on the levers of power.I’m not sure why the men have become such cucks though. Perhaps there is estrogen in the drinking water.

                Of German stock myself; putting several generations of alpha males six foot under in two world wars didn’t help. Native borne German friend (&amp; German Navy Veteran) describes modern German males as “eunuchs” with about as much similarity to the German male of 1940 as to a unicorn.

                I think being a cuck is natural to men re: dealing with women. Wooing, keeping them happy, etc. Usually also the need for labor, engineering, military, which cultivate the masculine virtues and provide balance.
Trending towards ease and luxury for a long time, but rise of high tech + end of the Cold War have definitely made us rotten the last 3 decades or so. It’s simply been an especially feminine time with little need for men. We’ve been on the outs.

                    Not sure I agree with men always being cucks. I don’t see either myself or any of my friends as that. All of our ladies are proper women who looked after home and kids. I would never go against my nature for the approval of a woman.I agree with the decadence through abundance and luxury though.Not sure how it will change. Adversity and famine maybe.

                        Speaking from experience, women don’t like being treated on equal terms. It even freaks some of them out. So much of it is humoring them, which I suppose is OK as long as you don’t have to sacrifice your dignity. The whole grrrl power phenomenon is an extreme. How to deal with girl boss? Maybe cuck is too strong a word, but I’m not sure anymore.

                        I think it’s sufficient to defer to women in areas of their particular expertise, and to lay down the law in other areas…Women cannot be allowed to make important decisions otherwise….

Good grief.  Women have made some of the most important decisions in world history.  Margaret Thatcher comes to mind. Madame Currie another.  There are too many transformative historical women to name.  Sounds like you’re jealous of others’ accomplishments.  That the other may be female just doesn’t sit well with you, does it?

                                That’s the NAXALT argument–i.e., I know a woman who makes good decisions. But specific exceptions do not vitiate the general rule. And generally speaking, it is best for society that women have little executive power outside the domestic realm.

It’s best generally for the women too. We seem to be wired with a nervous system that accounts for tiny helpless infants. We need to the men to take on those sorts of public responsibilities.  They tend to make even the best of women crazy. Great nurses do not necessarily make great MDs.

                                        Under the circumstances it seems very odd that women have not only failed to rise in opposition to “leaders” endlessly committing their people  to one war after another, but once in positions of national leadership have failed to prioritize domestic needs to those of the MIC.

                                “Madam Curie,” LOL. Yeah, the feminist propaganda was indoctrinating me with that bullshit over fifty years ago. Amelia Earhart (who crashed and died and failed) was also upheld as a Great Womyn.How about Henry Ford, George Washington, George Westinghouse, Rudolf Diesel, Thomas Edison, Lindbergh, Neil Armstrong, Orville Wright, Glen Curtiss, Isaac Newton,  Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein and Thomas Jefferson?Sure, Curie made a contribution to Western Civilization, but it was relatively minor compared to what white men accomplished. She shared her Nobel with her husband, also a physicist. A fair amount of her accomplishment as part of a joint effort with a white man.It’s an objective fact that the world as we know it was created by white men. Not by women.

                                Those are terrible examples. Thatcher was a neoliberal who sold off much of England’s remaining assets to the globalists for a quick buck. Wow, what an “economic miracle”! Offshoring the remnants of your productive capacity to the third world. What a heroic woman.Now London is 30% English and produces nothing but financial derivatives. Quite the legacy of “conservative values”. Perhaps only Churchill did more damage to the UK.Curie and her husband poisoned themselves with radium and died before they turned 40.You should have said Catherine the Great or something. Maybe Victoria.Anyway, pretty much the level of historical literacy that I would expect from a woman. Abysmal.lol. Just kidding.Or am I? XD

                    No it’s not. Men have been trained wrong. They have been tricked by the media and school system.In reality, nothing turns a woman off more than a weak man. You are completely wrong about this. Women respect men less because they have been cuckified, it’s definitely not “keeping them happy”.Most men today are so weak they are scared of being called badthink names… can you get anymore pathetic?No small wonder the birthrates are crashing along with testosterone levels. Our culture is broken.I was trained wrong too when I was a kid, but instead of simply eating from the globohomo pravda trough forever, I eventually did my own research and field tests and realized that, yes actually, women prefer their men to not be sniveling homos scared of being called a racist of misogynist or w/e.Now women are easy to deal with. Pretty much. They may get temporarily mad at me for being kind of a dick sometimes but… they also secretly prefer it. Look at the “porn” they consume, it’s romance novels. Go read a few of the synopses. 95% of them are about a self insert trying to get the attention of a guy who is the complete opposite of a soyboy. Often, the object of their fantasies will even ignore them or be rude or dismissive. Eventually she wins him over due to her specialness or because of fate or w/e. Vampires and werewolves and crap. Strength and power is what is attractive to women, especially physical power. Animalistic power. Be a beast in bed, you know? That’s what they love. That’s how you keep a woman happy, fundamentally. The rest is secondary.Feminism is a lie. It’s really only beneficial to lesbians.But you know… the people who rule us have made it a point to staff the managerial class with gays and lesbians… hence globohomo. Hence clownworld. Up is down, bad is good, black is white, etc.Nearly every traditional value that used to keep society running has been inverted and/or destroyed.

                “Perhaps there is estrogen in the drinking water.”I get the comment, but my repressed academic side leaps out anyway.  Yes there is estrogen in the water.  At my old university it was one of the contaminants we were monitoring for decades—thanks ladies.  Also, the ubiquitous plastics leached into the environment are said to mimic estrogen in their effect.  From ChatGPT:“…estrogen-like byproducts of plastics in the environment are primarily called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). A notable group of these chemicals includes xenoestrogens, which mimic estrogen in the body and can interfere with hormonal processes in humans and wildlife.”The question of cause of infertility and declining birth rate still debates over the effect of these estrogens in the environment.  Sigh….

                    I tend to agree. The testosterone decline has been documented for decades, as an aside, but no one ever asked “why?” Enviornmental factors certainly loom large and at least paved the way for the cultural and social surrender to feminism.

                    John B. Calhoun’s mouse utopia experiments, particularly “Universe 25,” were a series of studies, repeated multiple times, that explored the effects of overcrowding and high population density on the behavior and well-being of mice. These experiments, conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, revealed a phenomenon Calhoun termed the “behavioral sink,” where overcrowded populations exhibited increasingly abnormal and dysfunctional behaviors, ultimately leading to societal collapse and eventual extinction. When the die-off of the mice reached a level of greatly reduced population and lots of food, the mouse population did not recover and continued to die off until ALL died off and were gone.

                ‘I’m not sure why the men have become such cucks though. Perhaps there is estrogen in the drinking water.’
Probly there is.  But that ain’t the heart of the matter.
Men will organize to fight other groups of men, but men will not organize to fight female collective power — even when that power disenfranchises and persecutes them.  Even when that power patently destroys their own nations and civilization.
This is the primordial male flaw, look around you and read the Scripture.  Men will overcome this or go into even deeper bondage.

Because the owners of the media agree on anti-whiteness and they dictate our morality.  Whites want to be moral and our morality is now dictated by those who hate us.
The trusting nature that allowed whites to work together beyond familial ties has been poleaxed by the orchestrated attack of the mass media.

                        The invasion didn’t begin en masse until feminism long had been institutionalized across the West, most radically in America, Canada and Britannia.By the time the caravans started, the society already was feminized for decades, with men sufficiently cowed, isolated, impotent or uncaring as to permit invasion.  Or cheer it.Consider the demographics: the government, media, schools, colleges, intel agencies, courts and even churches backed the Sisterhood.  Global elites — especially the Rockefellers — poured endless billions into feminism and the shift far leftward.  Women overwhelmingly backed feminism, along with weak/inexperienced men plus most dads of daughters.That doesn’t leave much left over to organize and effect resistance against invasion . . . or anything else, like being locked down for a Scamdemic.  SECURITY is the craving of women; FREEDOM is the craving of men.  Guess who lockdowns target?A fight not being on the table — and essentially being alone — I went for second best and used the decades for advocacy and persuasion.  Trying to chip away at that demographic hegemony.

                            Feminism gives men benefits. There’s the obvious issue in the sexual realm, but it also includes family life. Men can go get dream jobs, rather than boring well paying ones. If difficult sons prove lazy (the male part of the fall), well ambitious daughters will fill in the gaps.Women’s sports are the idea of men. Organized sports are a way of trying to make men out of young women, generally speaking. Women in public leadership roles of all kinds means they don’t have to.Feminism exists because men gave up on civilization about in the late 19th century. Once men are ready to take it back, there will be no stopping them.

                                    It was a big mistake to allow women into any sport.  Sports is a sublimation — and preparation for — violence and combat.  That was it’s original intention and still should be.The idea behind women in sports was that females would gain positive (male) attributes that would make them more well-rounded, more amenable to the presence of rules and rule-making, and so forth.Turned out that females were females, and not men.  Largely, they did not absorb honor, fairness, team-precedence, acknowledgement of rules etc.Why? Because those are within the realm of men and masculinity and are not naturally feminine things.  All you end up with are a bunch of dykes, generally.

It was a male idea to have them there in the first place. As you noted, the point of sports was to shape women into outstanding men.
So here again we come against the universal male lazy streak in trying to get away with not shaping their sons into outstanding men. Young women are easier to influence in many ways.

                                ‘Feminism gives men benefits. There’s the obvious issue in the sexual realm, but it also includes family life.’Family life? lol Feminists in the Sixties explicitly made ‘family life’ their target to destroy. And did a pretty good job thereafter doing just that.‘If difficult sons prove lazy (the male part of the fall)’Laziness had nothing whatsoever to do with the Fall. The Fall was caused first by the female’s desire to have power equivalent to God, including power over the male.The second aspect of the Fall was the man’s obedience to the female, instead of obedience to God. Essentially, humans chose the feminist model, and usually still do. God didn’t appreciate that so they got tossed outta the Good Life on their asses.Nothing at all to do with laziness in sons, that’s just some accusation you pulled from the air.Go away now until you know what you’re talking about.

Your post to me can be summarized as whining about how women won’t let men rule the roost. That’s laziness and indifference I was talking about in regards to the fall.

                The current rulers are definitely cucks…. but a fact most people seem unaware of is that the European elites have always regarded having sex with children as a right, with or without “consent”…Hence the complete indifference of Parliament, Lords, and the Police to the Paki and Gypsy rape gangs and their trafficking of the victimized girls, for at least 25 years…PM Thatcher invited Jimmy Savile to her place for Christmas one year, and she also intervened to stop police investigation of Conservative MPs for their child sex activities….

                Filthie, the Israelis are the ones who didn’t succumb and continue fighting  the extreme barbarism. Israelis are universally hated for it, especially because the males of some other countries are not capable of protecting  their women. But the hate is nothing new to the Jews.Look at the pictures of IDF male soldiers: there is no hint of estrogen there.

                    They are universally hated for infiltrating other countries and bending the power of those countries (mostly by crook) to their ends resulting in the destruction of those countries.
But I have to hand it to them – they are masters at deception and tribalism, and have no qualms of jettisoning decency, shame and compassion to suit their ends.  Through this they have been able to achieve their objectives quite well.

            What we are witnessing, as Martin Armstrong has repeatedly pointed out, is the death of Socialism worldwide. Mrs Thatcher was right, and all Socialist governments, including “our own,” have finally run out of other people’s money. Pension funds and “social welfare” budgets are busted flat, and there is no going back; the problems are consuming entire countries, and it’s only going to get worse. Disastrously worse.So it might not be too late for Europe. Or for “our” country either b/c the VAST majority of foreigners that have flooded into Europe and America and elsewhere are in it for the money that Socialist governments everywhere have paid them to colonize White countries, so when the Socialist gravy train derails–as it is doing right now–the aliens might very well decide to go back to where they came from or, failing that, might be forcibly repatriated by resentful and poverty-stricken White populations everywhere as the luxuries of liberalism and the “feel-good” multi-culti mania are given up as unaffordable.

                I’m always puzzled by those who say socialism is our root problem because I believe that most people who blame socialism like having public utilities, police and fire departments, national parks, and even a social safety net that prevents poor people from dying in the streets.
Is there a sharp division between the programs I listed above and nation-destroying socialism, or is it simply that“everything I dislike I call ‘socialism?&#x27;”
My suspicion is the people who blame socialism are afraid to discuss the real causes of our decline.

                    I think liberalism rather than socialism. Not a socialist myself but see the attraction to others.Liberalism leads to an anything goes society. Sodomy, child rape, assisted suicide of elders to get the fruit of their life’s work. Nothing is beyond the pale. Nothing is ever taboo.

                    Yes. Also, if things become dire enough the strip mining of whites always can step up. This isn’t socialism but service of client groups; socialism within a homogenous group can work even if we can debate about its efficacy. In a heterogenous society racial who/whom takes the wheel when redistribution begins. Always.

                    I think the thing that people complain about is therevolutionary spiritthat has infused everything the system touches. It’s one thing to have cops, it’s another to have cops that act as enforcers to the regime, arresting people who protest tyrannical COVID edicts while literally bending the knee to blacks who loot and riot a week later. It’s one thing to have a national park to allow citizens to enjoy their country’s beauty, it’s another to have a system that declares White people to be evil because blacks don’t hike, or claiming it is racist to say that people should be quiet and not litter on trails. The social safety net is good in abstract, but in practice, what has it gotten us? A monster welfare state, tons of theft and fraud from the third world newcomers, and a “welfare industrial complex” that benefits the worse the problem gets.

                    I have a knee-jerk reaction whenever someone blames ‘socialism’ or ‘communism’ for modern ills, because I have come to regard those as simplistic, binary terms that don’t begin to explain what ails us.  And while I definitely see the utility of some public services, I’m still a social darwinist at heart.  Yes, it benefits the community to have all children be literate, but I oppose ‘public’ education.  No, I don’t want to see people dying in the street, but I struggle to have sympathy for really stupid people making stupid choices.

                                Not anymore, they don’t. Communism is passe’. It flickered out in the second half of the sixties and was replaced by race struggle, i.e. Judeo-Puritans and negroes waging a sustained cultural war on whites.

                    Is there a sharp division between the programs I listed above and nation-destroying socialism, or is it simply that “everything I dislike I call ‘socialism?’”
“Socialist” initiatives must needs be firmly grounded in a pragmatic nationalist framework to prevent them from devolving into pie-in-the-sky “save the world” utopianism.
My suspicion is the people who blame socialism are afraid to discuss the real causes of our decline.
My suspicion is that people who leap to defend socialism should be watched very closely, and that one should do a careful count of the silverware after they’ve gone home.

If he wasn’t, I don’t think he would be asserting that “most people who blame socialism like having public utilities, police and fire departments, national parks, and even a social safety net that prevents poor people from dying in the streets.”
He’s critiquing those who misguidedly tilt at socialist windmills while the dragon of anti-white racism is immolating their civilization.
Respectfully, I think you have that backwards.

            Every time I see a European Mandarin on TV I get the urge to grab my sword and Viking boat. I don’t know how those dweebs’ wives can even have sex with them. Remember when European leaders were so feared, that if you had a strong man in, say, France, even a Vietnamese man would feel the effects? Remember when Europe was so singular and imposing that it basically declared its own CONTINENT because it didn’t wan to be associated with Asiatics? (It should be Eurasia, not Europe and Asia.)Can you imagine Emmanuel Macron fighting off the Huns? He’d sooner be in a Baghdad harem.

            I agree – it’s very disheartening.It sucks that all this is all recorded for posterity too – imagine, 6 generations down the road, being able to look up how your ancestors behaved.  “Well, you see, a bunch of foreigners were targeting and raping their women in their homelands, but they were afraid of beingracist, you see…” and then seeing a video of some effete, noodle necked Euro politician of this time.   Sure would make you proud of your lineage, wouldn’t it?I think one way to improve the quality is to get the men into combat sports – make MMA, boxing, that kind of stuff big in Western Europe for the natives.  Russians and Ukrainians are over represented in these sports, and neither group comes across as a bunch of bitches (like Western Euros do).  Foster a warrior spirit.

                A lot of good that is doing Russia. The French writer Celine had become so disgusted with the slackness of the sybaritic men of his generation, out of admiration for the manly discipline  of the Fascist movement was, without ever becoming an admirer of Hitler or a Lord Haw-Haw, damned as a collaborationist and forced to flee France. In Germany, the first thing Hitler did with the Hitler Youth was have them involved in continuous combat sports. A lot of good that did them in the end. There is nothing wrong, as JFK himself did with his Council on Physical Fitness, complete with badges for fit youth. Calisthenics, not MMA

            I would love for the European people to perform a continent-wide French Revolution on the EU leaders, then regain their independence from GAE followed by a rapprochement with Russia.  Europe has the opportunity to shake things up geopolitically, but I imagine their vassalage is too ingrained to go against their masters.

        This is Germany’s shining moment. Will the Germans seize the opportunity to lead Europe out of its Anglo-American vassalage by declaring neutrality and embracing its historic trade ties with Russia? If the Germans take this step, world history will change and the West will enter a new epoch. Look east, young German, look east!

                    In our dumb future, histories of the 20th Century will definitely say that America killed the Jews. Maybe Roth’sThe Plot against Americawill be regarded as a primary source, and saying it’s fiction will be a crime. The current situation isn’t much dumber than that.Old guys don’t know, but kids now are taught that it was the work ofwhite supremacy—not the crazy Germans anymore, now that they’re defeated. Recent pop propaganda (the latest Burns, e.g.) takes the old “neonazi” line that Hitler was only trying to deport the Jews but England and America wouldn’t let him. Whitey forced his hand!We’ve joked for years: Anne Frank’s story is de facto Holocaust denial because she died exactly the way a Holocaust denier would guess she did. I don’t think the joke will quite come true, but her story will be re-read: the Americans bombed the deportation system into deadly dysfunction, andthat’show everybody died. The gas chambers will fade away, as the “burned alive in the ovens” stories of our youth did.

        Okay. Guys, I love Americans. I love Dissidents. I love Trump! 😂But…hell’s bells! No, Blumpf did not sack  Turdo. That retarded whoreson cut his own throat long, long ago. Starmer is a dead man walking as is Macron, and pretty much every other leftist political creature right now. We are watching the natural collapse of the political left. It was decades in the making. Their own people are involved in sweeping them away. Turdo resigned rather than risk getting shot…possibly by his own people.This is the brilliance and cunning of the Orange Menace. The left is systematically and collectively shooting themselves in the balls round the world…and Don takes credit for it. Elon is shooting fish in a bucket. If he didn’t do it someone else would.At best, Trump is maybe just hurrying things along a bit.😂

                My guess is the Canadian Left realized Turdo outlived his usefulness (polling in the low 20s, meaning only the hardcore woke-fem true believers).  I doubt Donald much factored into the decision.  The Left is moving on to a fresh face to popularize.Let’s see who the replacement PM is before popping the champagne on the departure of Margaret Trudeau’s personal disaster. My money is on The Waddler, Chrystia Freeland.  Can(t)ada law and culture are gynocentric like the States.It’s time to dump weak, woke fembot males like Turdo and install the real thing.  This will serve, at minimum, as novelty to distract the sheeple for a couple of years.

            Ok but another way to look at it is the weak liberal weenies are being dumped by their puppet masters having served the purpose of weakening their nations to the point of collapse. Yuri Bezemenov told us that initiating a crisis was the last stage before “normalization” aka totalitarian dictatorship.
Trump strikes me as the archetypical “strong man” who in the past was installed in an African country to make it easier for Amerika or Soviet Union to “harvest” their natural resources.
There are no heroes or good guys in modern politics.

That necessarily presupposes the existence of a Cold War-level Amerika or Soviet Union to train, equip, promote, insert and prop up your hypothetical strong man.

            Trudeau may be stepping down. However, a thoroughly Regime psychopath is waiting in the wings. Peterstein is already promoting him. The guy’s bio reads like WEF of the tech bros. He has been in organized politics since he was 16. He is all in on TGR. The problem is they just need to build far more houses and eliminate the red tape preventing them all from becoming doctors, engineers and health care professionals immediately.At least Caracalla was an alien to Rome when he liquidated the Roman people by making the entire empire citizens and thus nobody a citizen. This guy is French Canadian and he is going to liquidate the Canadian people. The line will go up!!!! The big aggregate number will get extremely large!!!!But, Canada and Canadians will be liquidated. To think The West ends on a giant liquidation sell and what is liquidated isn’t the material wealth but the people themselves.The Chinese and Indian scholars, if they even give a fig, are going to scratch their heads. Then they’ll shrug and smile as they put their feet up and enjoy the view of their North American homeland.

                The hope is that Trump sets in motion a thousand populist-nativist politicians in the so-called West…alpha males…Caesars who can speak to people without a prepared statement. Canada will be liquidated if nobody stands up for Canada, and Trump may pave the way for some burly logger type from Medicine Hat who got in a zillion hockey fights and is inspired to run for office. People are sheep; even brown people. They will follow the strong man, even if he’s a blond nationalist.

                    I may get egged for saying it – and I want to point out that I stand on side with Dissidents when it comes to the subject of female politics, authority  and influence…But Danielle Smith the exception that inevitably pops up with every rule. She has bitch slapped Turdo and taken his lunch money. She shoved it up his arse in court a couple times now. She did that in a very lady like and businesslike fashion – if such a thing is possible? She openly defies Turdo and Trump has rightfully invited her to his inauguration and accepted her into his court as the real voice of the Canadian people. She’s similar in many ways to your DeSantis… but I think she might be smarter than he is… time will tell. She will be one of the more interesting figures to watch in Canadian politics moving forward.But… whadda I know? Women are capable of anything and certainly not to be trusted or counted on… but… sometimes, maybe?

                                Absolutely. I once caught more flak for it than I do recently, but by far the most dangerous prong of the Judeo-Puritan elite is the Puritans. “Traitors” doesn’t even come close.

                                Exactly.  This is the “I know a good one” phenomenon that Compsci noted above.  A white guy can have a few pleasant interactions with a non-white and he’s ready to surrender his country.
Most white people are so agreeable and they so much want to believe that most people of other races have the same good will within their hearts, that they literally cannot imagine the tribalism that rules the hearts of most non-whites.
It’s like there is a color or a frequency that everyone can perceive but whites.

            It’s not either/or. The collapse of the Left could take a long time without a few strong pushes here and there. As to “If he didn’t do it someone else would”, possibly but no one comes to mind.

        The UK is rapidly circling the drain and has been for decades. It’s now borderline 3rd world and getting worse by the day. Starmer or not, no party or PM can save the UK as it has deindustrialized to the point of insignificance and is rapidly being colonized by the dusky hoards. The UK today is basically the City of London surrounded by multiple 3rd world shit hole cities.When I was liaison for my company in Germany, I worked with a number large and medium sized UK industrial companies. Several could trace their roots back to the turn of the last century.When asked about their long term viability, even back in 2010-2015 these companies admitted they were seriously concerned about replacing older employees who were close to retirement and the loss of highly skilled Polish machinists. It was impossible to find younger workers who were willing to stand in front of a CNC mill or lathe 8-hours a day like their father’s had before them. And even their employees from Eastern Europe (mostly Poles) saw the writing on the wall.Fast forward to this past year and most of those same companies have closed their doors. Rather than trying to find work elsewhere in the UK, the Poles simply packed up and went home, many to jobs that were waiting for them.In Poland, wages have improved significantly and it’s 1000% safer for themselves and their families, their children and their women. Companies like Raytheon, Borg Warner and others who have opened shop in Poland offering modern, up-to-date machine centers with brand new equipment. Meanwhile in the UK, lack of investment and upgrades meant workers were trying to keep 50-75 year old machines running.As in the US, here in Europe the ‘greatest generation’ is long gone and our collective futures are dependent on a new generation that has no sweat equity in today or any sense of purpose for the future. Their university liberal arts degrees are useless and even those who have STEM degrees have no opportunities to use them.Across the West, political leadership is a massive void sucking in the worst possible people to rule over us. I hope Trump can turn things around, but I suspect it will be only four years at best before we’re back to what we just came out of.

Principals of the Trumpmusk administration already announced their dedication to infinity immigration. Both of heads have worn the tiny hat in public, and DJT did it with pride and enthusiasm, like a retard would. The Nov. election set up the AmericanDeep Statefor growth to totalitarian power.

            The UK economy was infinitely worse in the Seventies. What has changed is deindustrialization and the invasion of the brown hordes, both of which make a similar rebound unlikely. That’s true to a lesser degree in the States and continental Europe, of course, but it is hard to imagine a British recovery now, and I write that with great sadness. Just as people will not go to war for foreigners and/or corporations, they won’t seek national revival for aliens and hostile entities.

            Very true and very depressing.  While I’m still reassessing my opinion of Churchill, the leftist governments voted into power in post WWII England really were the nail in the coffin.  Yes, the lower classes had been treated like chattel and wanted payback, but the welfare state plus mass immigration of non-Whites (and yes, I know who was behind the Windrush) destroyed the native workforce.  Add in aging infrastructure (just as in the US) and the loss of the empire, and the picture is dire.  And the native Englishmen were so forbidden to notice population replacement that they instead focused their ire on the Poles (who should stay home and make Poland great) instead of the Pakis.

                Western Europeans staved off an early big recession by expanding east and absorbing its cheap and relatively well-educated workforce. This has been quite literally a blood-pump for the already aged economies. The thing is this model has been beaten to death, but the pathocrats and ossified oligarchs know no other solution. That’s why the non-white immigration will continue, especially with the retirement systems in peril. Democracy is murdering Europe as the elderly healthcare and pension systems are growing in significance with every election. Any major reform that takes major risks is a threat.The situation in the UK as described by Karl, brings back the early Cold War stagnation in Britain to my mind + millions of ethnic aliens.As for venting resentment on Eastern Europeans, this has been tried and true system for generations in the West. Allow anger, but in a “safe” directions, like the Slavs. Since the neo-colonial area is in no danger of breaking away, this has been allowed to stay for now.

        “The angry comments from Macron, Starmer and Olaf Scholz, the outgoing German chancellor, aimed at Elon Musk suggest these people are incapable of understanding what is happening to them.”Couldn’t agree with you morea proposyour whole essay. Stoltenberg, Macron, Starmer, Scholz, Trudeau have been what I call “Biden’s bum boys” (or catamites, to put it more politely). They were allowed to strut around as “world leaders” as long as they parroted the US regime’s line. Now that Biden is being flushed like the dog turd he is into the sewer of oblivion and Trump has no use for these bum boys, their political lives are essentially over. Stoltenberg’s term ran out, Trudeau has resigned and I expect the other three will (involuntarily) resign or be ignominiously booted out over the next year or so.More interesting is what the fate of Europe will be as the US under Trump becomes increasingly indifferent towards it. The old verities of the Cold War and the thirty-five years after 1990 are evaporating away and I don’t know what the new global arrangement will look like. Maybe even Trump isn’t clear in his mind about this.Musk with regard to Europe is operating as Trump’s attack dog. Musk is an interesting character — he is operating unashamedly and nakedly as a plutocrat. He seems to be co-president right now. The old plutocrats have operated in the shadows, been circumspect, and kept a low profile. Sort of like Don Corleone. Not Musk. To my mind the closest analogy I can find to him is perhaps Crassus who, along with Pompey and Caesar, formed the First Triumvirate and essentially bought the whole Roman government.

        It’d be great if Trump to some extent can defang the hydra that is the US government and its snake-like agencies.  Any reduction in their world wide meddling would be a welcome change, as would a more positive focus on America.  There’s a guy who goes by the handle Eugyppius on substack who started out detailing the scamdemic and has of late been focusing on the joke that is German politics.  Very good writer – check him out.

            Trump is up against fiscal, financial, economic, in short, mathematical obstacles that he will not be able to overcome.Moreover, the Deep State will NOT go quietly.And going by his public statements, which he may or may not mean, he will not end the Ukraine war on Day One or even at all. He wants to strike a deal with the Russians, but the Russians are NOT going to give up one single thing that they require, so what kind of deal Trump might be able to make is almost certainly not going to be what he thinks. The Russians KNOW–and say–that the West is “agreement incapable.” I doubt that Trump understands that AT ALL, let alone his thoroughgoing Zionist cabinet.And what in the heck does it mean that the notion–I wont call it an idea–of reducing the size, scope, and expense of FedGov can somehow be effected by ADDING another FedGov agency? WTF? “We are going to reduce the size of governments by adding to the size of government.” They are going to find that the way to putt out a fire is not by throwing gasoline onto it. And–again judging only by Trump’s always-theatrical public statements–he doesn’t seem to grasp the fact that, although he is (probably) going to be sworn in and move back into the White House, he will not possess the power that he seems to think he will. He will swear a solemn oath, hand on Bible, and will thus become the Chief Magistrate of the United States, committing himself to faithfully execute the laws of the United States. Which is going to mean that he cannot get rid of ANY of the big-ticket expenses of FedGov b/c they are enshrined in law as entitlements: Federal pensions, social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He does not and will not have the power to do anything AT ALL about that. It is Congress that has that power, and they will not use it to reduce spending on entitlements or, indeed, on anything else (what they like to call “discretionary” spending”).And finally, he can fire only political appointees; he does not have the power to fire civil servants. He CAN, however, order hiring freezes across the board and allow attrition to reduce the size and expense of FedGov, but it will be too little too late.

            I still wish the MAGA fantasies could come true. And perhaps, just maybe, small portions of it may. But Trump is still two weeks away from office, and he wants to invade the [former] Canal Zone and buy Greenland. OK, the man is given to hyperbole, but what about our pressing problems, Mr. President?

                He is a sort of semi-senile Teddy Roosevelt on a combination of steroids and Viagra: “Speak loudly and carry a big stick!” He acts as if he could unilaterally abrogate the Carter-Torrijos Treaty (his bellicosities were probably the last nails in poor Jimmy’s coffin), and his pronouncements about Greenland are simply nuts. Like other federal employees, he has taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution- and this would seem to imply, if not already conversant as to its provisions, to bring himself up to speed. The President is the Chief Executive, not a legislator.  He and Elon Musk would do well to focus on domestic issues, and getting authority for line-item veto should be a priority: Trump promised among others things last time around to balance the budget- and then signed off on- did not once veto 4 consecutive TRILLION dollar deficits- but was himself held hostage every time expansion of the debt came up.

        Europe is becoming a matriarchy enhanced by homosexual men. They will always gravitate to please the dominant power, which now is the US empire. The fact that Putin is a patriarchal opponent of the Empire, according to the Empire, will keep Europe tethered to the US until the day comes when masculine men once again take over – if they in fact do so.Trump presents a delimma for them. He is patriarchal and expresses bad thoughts even if he doesn’t act on them. The matriarchal and homosexual EU build their whole sense of self esteem on not being what they see as a Neanderthal like Trump. Yet if they don’t submit to him, they are faced with another patriarchal male that creates even more hysteria among the women and homosexuals. What’s a girl to do?

        Right on cue, various press outlets have called Musk a big meany and a poopyhead and a racist who is disingenuously talking about the deliberate targeting of White girls in the UK with drugs and prostitution and gang rape.  After all, what’s worse, gang raping our young and minor girls or offending a Paki?
Every single person involved in not prosecuting these pakis should be facing capital punishment.  They are complicit.  The entire families of every single paki involved should be imprisoned and then deported (at minimum).

        The absurdity of NATO really needs to be recognized. From a defensive standpoint, any rationale for NATO evaporated with the Warsaw Pact 30 years ago. The only purpose of NATO today is to maintain a large arms market for the GAE MIC.But it’s worse than that. Not one NATO nation has above-replacement fertility. There is no point at all in defending a people who don’t believe in their own future enough,even to populate it. Additionally, because the elites there are replacing the native populations, using our tax dollars to defend a bunch of third world ingrate rapists is way past stupid.

                        No. That would only treat a symptom of a greater disorder. Aristocratic reconstitution with patriarchal favoritism will advance by discrediting the big lies and corrupting biases of the Constitution and the declaration of “Separation”. Repealing the 19th amendment is, in comparison, just a little policy tinkering which leaves in place the framework which instigated adoption of the 19th in the first place. It would be a fine example tho of the conservative tendency to conserve “Progressivism” and the institutional forms which favor Jewish entryism and otzma Yehudit.

                    NATO. Defund NATO. The countries lost their need for men to defend them, and thus lost their men, who have no overarching role to the nation.  Military institutions used to be part and parcel.
Deliberately so; in the total surrender demanded by FDR and company, you wipe out the defenders so that all that remains are women and slaves.
Even pacified Japan and Korea have lost the male energy and competition driving mate selection. The RoK guys used to be hard as nails and truly feared. Where are the Vikings?

                            There is desperate need for strong and righteous men in the West. Their (arranged) absence indeed IS the problem of our nations.
Your point about martial experience, however, is well taken.  I had a ‘military family’ and served myself.  All the men from my family served, some officers some enlisted.  Way back then, the branches helped boys turn into men and were decidedly masculine spheres.

        Europe has already been severely wounded by the loss of the NS pipeline with it’s reasonably priced energy source. They will for the foreseeable future be buying LNG at about five times the price, if not more.
The really bad news is that the leadership in Qatar has signaled that they are not much interested in a pipeline project winding up in Turkey. They seem to be jumping on the LNG bandwagon. Who knows, maybe the U.S. will regime change them.

                Yes. Our folk embracing this is a part of us salvaging a bright future. Reactors will get smaller and smaller and the energy density is incredible. We could . We have the intelligence, curiosity and inventive spirit to be the vanguard of driving this forward.Imagine us building redoubts where this (https://www.radiantnuclear.com/) provides the power and we build our own low cost transmission/distribution mechanism. We then build out our own localized manufacturing capability.We can sit around and complain about H1Bs, which is to be fair fully proper to be outraged about. Better still, we can take matters into our own hands and build out patrimony networks around ourselves being the masters, not slaves, of technology. Ever smaller nuclear reactors are the future, that is already happening now.More and more developments are happening with companies like Radiant.Carpe Diem.

            I’ve been wondering how easy it’d be for a “rouge actor” to destroy one of the major LNG receiving ports in EU. Or why not several? Not quite as disruptive would be an attack on a LNG tanker at sea? All else equal, to disable or destroy a fixed facility should be no harder than it was for (supposedly) the Russians to bomb their own pipeline to Germany.It’s patently obvious that the entire purpose (engineered, or just opportunistic?) of the events of past few years are to make Europe highly dependent upon LNG from USA. If that were to be suddenly interrupted, well, it would really suck for the EU, particularly in the winter.I did a little hunting for LNG facility owning corporations that one might bet against, but the market doesn’t seem to offer anything at least for the little guy. Closest I find is Shell, but LNG is only a portion of their holdings.

        I wonder if Trump, or Musk, or whoever’s behind them, is starting to grok the Empire’s fundamental structural weakness. You can have the Empire, or you can have majority-minority America. Pick one, and since the latter is a foregone conclusion… As the Empire is getting abandoned one way or the other, a smart, farsighted American statesman would be issuing the Rescript of Honorius to the Euros right about now (and the Japanese, and the Koreans, and the Australians, and etc.). That’s probably giving Trump waaaay too much credit, but as I think Dr. Dre said, you don’t need to be a weatherman to feel which way the wind’s blowing…

I look around at everything that is happening and to me it seems as though the US is being lined up for hot war with Iran.
I feel like that explains the ease of Trump’s certification and relative current quiet.
Hot war with Iran is also perfect cover to ram through EOs about, reshoring, educational reform, digital ID, and getting those damn kids out of the basement.

            As American political and economic elites become-More post-national and less culturally Western EuropeanLess ethnically Western European and more racially alienThe Old American fixation on Europe and Europeans will by necessity begin to wane, which will cause the willingness to maintain the old post 1945 American Empire’s European satrapies much less important. Losing the Ukrainian War will go a long way towards that admirable goal of cutting ourselves loose from our near century long entanglements in Europe and maybe a possible return to American domestic focused politics and a 21st century consolidation of American autarky like happened from 1865 to 1914

        “No one likes Starmer, but Trump has reasons beyond that to attack him.”Starmer is an Irish [ethnicity A] man living in a 2nd country, Britain (English, Northern [Protestant] Irish, Welsh, Scottish) [ethnicities B], married to a Ashkenazi Jewish woman whose children he has had by are being raised Jewish [ethnicity C].His genetic pattern A is being discarded in parasitic favor of C while his memetic pattern (culture+) A has been abandoned while he lives in the land of B while serving C by helping C destroy B.There is nothing left of his individual contribution to his own heritage. The man is a complete whore who has sold it all out in service to genetic and memetic pattern destroying parasites. Even people who don’t have the cognitive chops to undertake analysis can instinctually ‘feel’ that there is simply something wrong with this boy.

        Yesterday’s quibble about a gang rape was actually from the court transcript, details at Mark Steyn’s.
They are rather worse than the passage. What has been done here- not only by our foreign overlords’ war against the White race, but with eager cooperation by our own people- is a crime that boggles the imagination. TPD!! All Pakis! Nuke the Raj!
No one listens to South Africa, but England- the very future they have planned for us- this must be fought with all the fire and fury a midsize nation summoned in 1940 when they too faced this hideous vision.

        One wonders what the US military thinks about a U.S. withdrawal from NATO?Multiple generations served there.  Many made their careers in European countries.  Took their families there, or married a local gal.It’s also a safe staging area for the US to launch into the Middle East, threaten Russia, supporting our greatest ally in every fresh atrocity they commit.This is going to be resisted by 90+% of current and retired US military leadership.The only way this happens is if Trump fires a lot of people and jails retired general officers for sedition if they criticize POTUS.A man can dream.

            A great many veterans served in Europe to keep the Red Army and it’s Warsaw Pact allies at bay.  When the Wall came down, it was time to bring the boys home.  Every one who has be stationed in Europe since has been there for no good reason at all.
I dare say everyone who was stationed outside CONUS after the Soviet Union dissolved had no good reason for being there.  Mali?  Ukraine?  Italy?  Bring the boys home, already.

        Putting Europe in its place has to be one of the priorities for any America First movement. Europe is a vassal state and has been since 1945, and NATO is the primary instrument of control. However, at some point, the tail started wagging the dog. NATO essentially ran the Brandon administration’s foreign policy. At some point, the globalists/rootless cosmopolitans fell in love with NATO, hard, and now they love it and the EU more than anything else. When they talk of the sacred institutions of our democracy, NATO is at the top of the list. EU is exactly the sort of stifling, ludicrous, bumbling bureaucracy that they love, the one that is designed to stifle the will of the people and is far more effective at doing so than the American federal government.So, NATO needs to go. The EU needs to go. Schengen needs to go. It all needs to go. It’s the only way we can have a viable West. As long as NATO is in the place it is in, it will work to undermine Trump and all MAGA America Firsters. As long as the EU is in the place it is in, it will work to flood Europe with third world migrants and implement the Kalergi plan.

        Something sociological always has troubled me about the state-sponsored British rape gangs. Fathers and white men in general appeared to be absent. My assumption, based no doubt on propaganda, was that the little girls either were fatherless or the dads were addicted and/or turned a blind eye. During this recent dust up, though, it has emerged that dads sometimes were arrested when they sought to intervene or asked for help. Do any Brits who comment here know if the harassment of vocal fathers was rare or simply their attempted interventions have been covered up? Something similar certainly happened in Virginia with tranny rapists but it was apparently just an incident or two.As for the larger theme, I dislike the GAE intervening in European affairs but if this can improve the lives of working-class whites in general and Brits in particular it is hard to criticize Musk and Trump on that point. The United States bears a lot of blame for the feminization of the world in general and Europe (and itself) in particular. Again, this somewhat reminds me of how the old USSR maltreated its vassals in the East Bloc but this may be the rare exception that deserves support.As for Farage: you were one hundred percent correct, Felix Krull.

            The single-mom, welfare queen culture that started in the 1960s is largely to blame for absent fathers in Britain. No real community, kids born out of wedlock and dads are on the dole, in jail, on drugs, gambling, down the pub: like the black ghettoes here, the kids are out of the street unsupervised and unprotected. Of course they are vulnerable to predators. Of course they get sucked into drugs, crime, and prostitution.Also, the sharp decline in Christianity after WW2. Watching soccer on TV with the lads at the bar is no substitute for learning the truths of Christ among a community of believers. Moral instruction, self-sacrifice, reliance on God rather than the omnipresent British state.

        If you haven’t seen it yet, there is video on Telegram that was taken from the helmet cam of a Ukrainian soldier engaged in a knife fight to-the-death with a Russian counterpart. It goes on for 18 minutes and is both bloody and brutal.You can see (and almost smell) the visceral fear and desperation of these two combatants while thrashing inches apart. That is the ancestral DNA of our evolutionary history reemerging from the shadows of our current cuck culture. Yes, it is still within us. And it must come back or we are doomed.

                    Tom,Did you read the comments on the page you linked to?“He was so brave even in his last moments. I hate seeing brave people die. Ukraine has to win. They must.”my god how stupid, we must win because my feelz!  When i first became aware this was all going to come apart in 2008, i spent years trying to tell people what was coming, only to face blank expressions at best and ridicule and scorn at worst.  One of the guys i’ve been reading since then said we must make sure our hearts do not become hard.  Back then i didn’t understand what he meant, now i do, because i say they all deserve what is coming to them at this point.  Too many people have too little knowledge of politics and history and feel they have a right to say stupid things and muck up the conversation.  That is what the last 15 years of trying to reach people has taught me, they don’t listen unless you’re a billionaire or on tv (or if you’re an attractive women they pretend to listen).  My heart has hardened.

                The Russian was a Yakut I believe, an Asian Russian. Maybe not white but probably a Christian. More so than the Ukrainian, if he would have been he would have been fighting on the other side.

                    No he would not have. Hardly anything in politics of Eastern Europe is more consistent than the correlation of militant leftist atheism and sympathies for Russia.

                        Neither religion nor politics is relevant in a knife fight. Basic instinct takes over whether the fight is with man or beast, and its survival of the fittest as evolution intended. We would all be better off if our rulers were survivors of a knife fight.

                    A worthy debate: which country exhibits a tiny sliver, a  vestige of Christian benevolence.

            I am reminded of the scene in Patton where he comes upon the wounded, lone survivor of a skirmish with the Germans. The soldier cannot stand, the ground around him is littered with corpses. “We were at it all night” he says. “We ran out of ammo. At the end, it was hand-to-hand”.
Patton kisses his forehead.

        The most damaging thing (in the short term) and most helpful thing (in the long term) that the GAE can do for Europe is pretend it doesn’t exist. Cut all ties. Unfortunately, it is not in the GAE’s nature to pretend that any place doesn’t exist. Europe is like an addict that needs to “hit bottom,” but it can’t as long as the GAE is its codependent.

        If I am Trump, I see the Canadian regime is inherently hostile to me, and I want it changed. Lucky for us in the 51st state, it will not require a colour revolution. And just because Justin is slithering aside does not mean it will stop. I expect Trump’s trolling will continue as long as the Liberals remain in power. Also, we will likely see a lot of endorsements, meetings and positive attention from Trump and his cadre towards Conservative parties at the national and provincial level over the coming year. Premier Smith of Alberta will be at his inauguration, for example.

            I have to admit, I am a little confused by the reaction to Trudeau’s resignation. When he came in, he was portrayed as this extremely handsome (likely why he had so much support from women and gays) and goofy product of nepotism. Yet he turned out to be the perfect man for globohomo. He was extremely ruthless and conniving and implemented everything his masters wanted with a speed and efficiency that was stunning. I think per capita they were bringing in something like 5-8x what we do in the USA, and even double or triple what we got under Brandon.Trudeau showed his true colors in the trucker protest in a way that I think surprised even people who were wary of him. In less than a decade he totally transformed and  destroyed Canada. It’s unrecognizable today. And let’s be real, they’re not going back. The conservative guy who is probably going to replace him is a total cuck on immigration. Trump can keep needling the Liberals but the damage is already done. I feel bad for Canadians.

That so few men of Our kind are vying for power and instead women who exist to submit to it is just depressing.Hopefully young Canadian men are building themselves up with positions of strength and ready to push people out of the way and do what men do – take what they want. Come Western Man! It is time to stop with the shame and guilt and do the taking. It is absurd that the men who fought WWII are shamed into submission by the people who were liberated and saved by them. One can only shake one’s head.

        Redirecting mass disgust from Indians to “muslims” was definitely somewhere in the calculus of whoever told Elon to let his meth pipe cool off and change subjects. There’s no way it was Trump, though I’m sure he’d think attacking England instead of normal Americans is a better idea.Of course Indians and Pakistanis are, by any reasonable standard, the same people. That’s why they’re known for the same things: scams, sex crime, and subservience. “Muslims” are different characters, though, in our mythology: dangerous rebels, territorial rivals, fanatics of their own thing, someone we can fight—not slave-minded rivals forlocal favorlike Indians/Pakistanis are.The actual “grooming” gang in England is the government. Pakis are H1-B analogs brought in to do the crimes against white people that local men won’t do—just as tech brings in Indians to do the surveillance and censorship white men won’t do.* The police are their management.*White men will do it in exchange for alotof money, or for (the feeling of) membership in the ruling class, but those are both axiomatically off the table. Trannies do it for free because they’re insane, but the production of them has maxed out. The tech “bro” future requireshugenumbers of psychotic micro-commissars. You’re too lazy!

            You sound Paki.
Paki: 9/11, KSM, Osama, Times square bombing, terror, stabbings, UK rape gangs London tube/subway/buses (7/7/2005), mowing down civilians with machine guns in india (bombay, kashmir), nuclear profileration, infinity terror
Indian: *crickets*. Crime rates in UK non existent or far below native population. Crime rates in Europe non existent or far below native population. Sex crimes *per capita* in their own country same level (or below) Japan.
Muslims/Pakis are pure filth and evil everywhere, in their own countries, in the UK, in Europe.

                Indian crime stats are a joke. ‘Official’ Indian crime rates are low because their society is so corrupt and broken that a huge amount of rape simply goes unreported. Why bother when you know that no justice will come of it and you will simply make your family a target for reprisals/social ostracization?There is a reason that a big deal is made of rape events like the overworked doctor woman sleeping in lecture hall getting raped during middle of day. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back AGAIN. It keeps happening, again and again and again. The ruling class of India doesn’t really have a clue how to stop it. They have a huge underclass who are little better than baseline Africans, except without the punitive culture necessary to keep predators fearful and in check.

                    Paki says what?
Shouldn’t you be blowing up some buses or throwing acid in faces? Maybe a live beheading of another Daniel Pearl perhaps?
Everywhere the Paki goes, it bring Terror. For example, here is random sample from Denmark.

Note the position of Pakis in this chart (at the top) and Indians (at the bottom). This same patterns is reflected wherever Indians live anywhere in the world and true wherever Pakis live, anywhere in the world.

            Historically, geographically, Pakistan was the poppy-growing Raj, carved off into an independent Muslim Indian state by crypto Prime Minister Clement Attlee after Churchill’s electoral defeat. Bangladesh, for example, was also carved off into a Muslim Dalit state in the same way.
(PAKI-stan is an amalgam of Pashtun-Afghan-Kurd-Indian/Iranian Land.)
When India was granted independence, the City of London was determined to keep their former East India Company colony asset open. The Middlemen had used their opium Raj to great effect funding political warfare and revolution ever since the 1850s, eventually evolving into our Five Eyes system.

                I had no idea that Pakistan was an acronym, thanks for letting us know. However several sources via Google give a different definition. Which makes sense as Kurdistan is quite furthur west:Choudhry Rahmat Ali referred to this new state as “Pakistan” in a pamphlet he wrote in 1933 titled Now or Never, Are We to Live or Perish Forever? The name Pakistan is basically an acronym compiled from the names of the areas ofPunjab, Afghania, Kashmir, Sindh, and Baluchistan.The word “Pakistan” also translates from Urdu to “Land of the Pure”. The Persian and Pashto word pāk means “pure”.

        The Euro Elite would rather be conquered by Muslims than admit their multi-cultural experiment has failed. Politics, like science, advances one funeral at a time. This  generation of Euro “leaders” must exit the stage before reform is possible. Things will get much worse in the meantime. We will not live to see it improve, notwithstanding Trump or Musk. As Zman says, it would take a heart of stone not to laugh at Starmer taking umbrage at Musk’s tweets while brushing off mass r*pe.

        RE NATO:  the alliance was created to keep Communism out of Western Europe.
A cursory review of the governments of the region shows that the alliance has failed in its mission.
Now, every dollar paid into NATO is just more Danegeld paid to placate an abstract, terroristic threat that has already kanded on the Continent.
Most of media produce is terroristic in nature.  Media products pimping the “need for NATO” are no different.
America doesn’t negotiate with terrorists!  Trump gets this!

        It may be a much less positive scenario than you outline.The ongoing, accelerating collapse of the global totalitarian bureaucracy (that reached its peak of power in early 2020) is probably more a matter of elite infighting over a share of the shrinking spoils (thereby wreaking even more damage to functionality); than it is likely to be some kind of successful backlash of common sense against leftist lunacy.If current world events are supposed to be an example of “creative destruction”, or the birth of something new and better; then so far (except for lots of empty words and easy predictions) we are seeing a lot of destruction, and nothing much in the way of creation, birth or betterment.

        The purpose of NATO has always been to “keep the US in, the Russians out, and the Germans down”.some scaled down version of NATO will probably limp into the 2030’s.  Nobody worries about keeping the Germans down any more.  They’re doing that on their own.  And the Russians can barely grind down Ukraine when they have a shared border and unmolested supply lines.It is good to see Trump taking a wrecking ball to Europe.  America is actually better off with closer ties to Russia.  I’ve always felt this way.  We don’t like Europeans much, either.  So we have that in common.  As China seeks to expand, being friends with Russia is a good idea.The unanswered about the UK gang rape crisis is how much the American public is absorbing it.  If that insanity is going on in Britain, then it is going on here, too.  I wonder when that dam will break and whether Mr. H1B will be so tolerant of South Asians…

        this jettisoning of Europe by the United States will mark the end of both Cold War Americaand the unipolar world.Decades after the Cold War officially ended, it will finally end in the West.Not if Zion isn’t destroyed and if the statutory framework of globohomo capitalist power is maintained. A prerequisite of the former will be a humiliation of the rabbinate and the Levites which wrecks their credibility. The latter requires abolition of incorporation with limited liability and abolition of globohomo’s central banks. (Stock markets will collapse as a result of making capital far less liquid.)President Trumpmusk has no mind or enthusiasm for any such radical reforms. What appears for now to be a jettisoning of Evrope will turn out out to be some rearrangement of deck chairs favoring Zion and capital loyal to Zion.

        Canada could never join the U.S.A.We would have to give up our universal medicare.  I had 4 stents installed in my heart 5 years ago – cost = $45.00 Cdn as my portion of the ambulance cost, and that’s it, for me and for everyone!  Welcome to Canadian medicare.We would have to allow guns and ammo everywhere, and that’s not the Canadian way.  We would need strict border controls to keep firearms out, just like we already have.  U.S.A. =4.31 deaths by firearms per 100,000 people. Canada had 0.57 deaths per 100,000, and we won’t allow that to change.Sorry guys.  Maybe you should take a few lessons from Canada how to do these things.♥ ♥ ♥ from Canada.

        As a more general background commentary:The obvious pivots of many of the “Powers that Be” confuse me in the past several months. It’s critical to notice that this about-face didnothappen only after Trump’s “unexpected” (?) electoral win, although it seems to have accelerated afterward. Some of the pre-election defection (e.g. non-endorsements by major papers) may have been due to insider knowledge of how badly Harris would likely lose.I’d leave it to those with better memory and/or access to news archives to pinpoint, in detail, precisely how and when the pivots and narrative changes began, but seems like months before the election. 2024 was such an odd year. Biden’s plain for all to see flop in the June debate, and his queer dropping-out immediately afterwards, at a guess.What strikes me as particularly weird is what I’d call the sucking-up of powerful Lefties (many of them billionaires) to the new regime. In very recent weeks we’ve seen, for example, outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau visiting Trump at his Mar-a-Largo estate. Meanwhile, social media moguls seem to have found Right Wing Religion. Witness the very recent announcement that Zuckerberg has suddenly decided that the so-called “fact checkers” are no longer welcome on his FaceBook. I’ll just comment on this particular one, but it probably generalizes well to other case of about-face. Here we have what’s surely one of the most powerful men in Media, and (I’d guess) one of the richest men in the world, making nice with the new regime. His company is almost surely a Deep State asset, indeed going back to its founding over twenty years ago, by some accounts, In any event, what’s beyond all doubt is that as recently as a couple years ago at the peak of the “Pandemic” Facebook, Twitter and all other major media enthusiastically suppressed inconvenient speech. It was later disclosed that much of that censorship happened with the active participation and presumably at the command of the Deep State.My overall skeptical question is simply this: What are we to make of the sudden change in the narrative of these ultra-powerful figures? So recently they were all-in with the Progressive idiocy of the day, whether BLM, George Floyd, Ukraine, transsexuals, Oct. 7, and so forth. Now I am supposed to believe they’re on board with the Trump administration?Pardon me if I doubt the sincerity of these apparent changes of heart. Perhaps they’re realized the errors of their ways and/or are simply kowtowing to Trump &amp; Co. Or perhaps there is some hidden agenda.

        The danger is to Trump and Musk. Possibly also Zuck at this point. Starmer has every advantage and Musk is courting disaster.Starmer does not have to call an election for five years. By which time he will have jailed or gulaged so many Whites that he will simply breeze through with Muslim votes. Meanwhile he can issue an arrest warrant for Musk. Which the Biden/Obama White House will be happy to oblige. Musk has money. He does not have the power to arrest people. Starmer does. So in that relationship Starmer has all the power.Then if Trump says something, Starmer will issue an arrest warrant for Trump. [British Media is already talking about the UK dumping the Special Relationship]. Judge Merchan will use that warrant to sentence Trump to 20 years, effective immediately. Surely Dark Brandon will send the US Marshals and Seal Team 6 to arrest Trump, they are the Party of Chaos.The Chaos, including Trump’s Jailing for 20 years, or extradition to the UK, or outright Seal Team 6 “liquidating” is what Dems plan for. Its why they were quiet, no AntiFa, no Jan 6 Histrionics, nothing. Again, they are the Party of Chaos.Because the Chaos will allow the Lightworker as leader of the Party to step in and “restore order” by “Special Rule” or what have you for life. The Deep State is not going to allow rich guys and ordinary voters to have their way. If Vindman can say with a straight face that Trump deserved impeachment for contradicting “the inter-agency consensus” then anything from the Deep State is possible.And since the above action is all stupid, it fits right in with the Deep/Derp State: all powerful, all stupid. The Derp State does love its chaos self-generated to provide its “solution.”

            Why did Antifa and BLM stand down while Trump won the election? Why no riots, etc.? (Not ruling them out for the inauguration, however).What happened was October 7. The Jewish funds and brains of the Left had a horrible realization and reined in their pets while backing Trump (best candidate for Israel). That’s why you saw pro-Hamas protesters beaten on college campuses, while those same miscreants had free rein in 2020. October 7 changed everything. A point was always going to come when left-leaning American Jews were presented with a binary choice: Leftism or Israel. And blood is thicker than water.

            (Sorry, hit upvote, it gave a downvote to Whiskey)
Agree, we still have 3 weeks, this is why Merchan is squeaking up again.Plus, they can re-capture Big Social Media with one blow.

                As Jannie points out, it all boils down to what is best for israel. If Trump in power is best, then he stays in power as long as he remains israel’s whore (which he appears to have no problem doing).
As for warrants and what not, Starmer can get them issued, but who will enforce it? Sorry, the Brits are more of a paper tiger than we are.
