        Everything must be converted to the political. Living in the suburbs and driving cars have been turned into political statements, as have been marriage to someone of the opposite sex and having children within wedlock. Why can’t lunch just be lunch, no more and no less?

        We’re all the same inside, but we come in different wrappers?  Is that what they mean?  So what’s next, a special wrapper just for African-Americans?  Another one to celebrate illegal immigrants?  There’s no end to how this game of “equal but separate” can be played. Of course, on the rare occasion when I do stop at a fast food shop, I’m there to eat, not for a lecture. If I want a lesson in morality, I consult my religious leader, not my burger cook.

        I can imagine gays may be secretly dismayed that their ‘passion’ can now been reduced to the wrapping on low-quality-dead-animal burgers. Something that can be thrown away.
