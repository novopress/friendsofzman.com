        I enjoyed “Holidays in Hell”, too. And I did think that “Foreigners around the World” was pretty funny. But sadly I think the Z-Man is on to something here.

            I read PoW on a flight from NY to Cincinnati…I was laughing so hard other passengers were turning around to see what was funny. I held up the book so they could read the title

            I’ll give you that one, but that was 25 years ago too. And the category of “humorous anti-government books” is pretty small. Still, O’Rourke is just not very funny and he has been decidedly unfunny for a long time. My sense is that “satirists and humorists” are mostly mean spirited dickheads who try to knock off the hard edges with a little humor. Their point is never to make you laugh.

                My first response was “What about PoW?  That was a blazing fastball!”……..but I see other batters have already jumped on it.  Just prior to PoW, his Republican Party Reptile was good, and he had a couple fair ones in the 90s.   But agree on your overarching point – PJ is hitting 0-for-the-millennium.

        A truly conservative Jew, like Auster, and there are dozens of them, does not shirk from the fact that the natural state of Jewish politics is ruinous to liberty. It would be amusing to watch the arc of that progressive boomerang as it comes back behind them to take their heads off, as in France, if it weren’t coming for me also. But they do their thing whatever the cost and then move on, not to repeat the German mistake. I understand the sentiment, though. If there were a place to move on to, I would. This at one time was a county in which that could be done. I would have it back.
