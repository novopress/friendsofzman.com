        Backlash done right.Sooner or later this country will get a leader (might even be called Mr. President) that it needs.  Shortly afterwards ten or twenty Muslims will die, as suddenly as a gay man thrown off a tall building but with more noise.  If they all fail to get the message then another fifty million or so will depart the same way.   Any remaining Islamic nations will learn that being able to build a nuclear weapon is nice, being able to deliver one on time and with pinpoint accuracy is better.New math: At fifty million a pop, how long before you run out of Muslims?

        Here’s part of a recent tweet I read:  “a gun filled country caught up in a frenzy of Muslim bashing”.  Where as that, I wonder.

        “BACKLASH” was when violent mobs of Islamaphobic NYers stormed Atlantic Ave enmasse burning &amp; smashing the windows of all the Arab stores on 9/12/01, and then proceeded to torch a few Brooklyn mosques. Oh wait that didn’t happen. Instead there was a few instances of drunk guys yelling “raghead” at some Sikhs. If nothing happened after 9/11 except increasing Muslim immigration into the US &amp; an attempt to build a Ground Zero Mosque, there will be no backlash now.

        The “Backlash” is a linchpin of the fantasies that progressives tell themselves so that they can continue to engage in a distorted game of psychological displacement, moral equivalence and minority grievances rather than face facts.  In the case of Islam, the imminent arrival of the Backlash is alleged again and again (and with nary a shred of evidence of having ever arrived – it’s the Great Pumpkin of political retribution) to uphold the core belief that vast hordes of largely imaginary bad whites are violent bigots.  If bad whites are violent bigots, then Muslims are aggrieved victims, and Muslim violence, while perhaps regrettable, is an understandable reaction to a long chain of unbearable injustices. When rationalized in this way, progressives can avoid uncomfortable dilemmas themselves, such as having to account for the actual doctrines of Islamic faith and its history of violence and conquest.  When slightly reconfigured, the same scenario plays out for blacks.The circularity of the reasoning is immensely satisfying, since as long as the core postulates remain undisturbed, the chain of logic, such as it is, remains unassailable.  Which is of course why the core postulates, absurd and tired as they may be, must be revived and reiterated with such rabid and unrelenting determination and consistency.The payoff is the continual reassurance that the holder of these beliefs is on of the elect, one of the “good” as opposed to one of the bad, whites.  The desperate need to be one of the elected good seems to override the usual instincts for survival based on the application of common sense to potentially threatening situations – and hence we have the growing chasm in our politics between those who need to maintain their righteousness and those of us who would like to live to see another day by acting with prudence.

        I only disagree on one point. “The coming war is the war with Islam.” That war has been in progress for a while, our betters just don’t want to acknowledge the fact, lest they have to actually prosecute a war and accept all kinds of “icky bad think.” Or what you might call, objective reality.

            That war has been going on for a very, very long time.  In fact Islam has been at war with the civilized world for most of it’s existence.

        While I agree that the muslim cause would be helped enormously if they stopped killing people, they also know that we are getting used to them killing people. Soon it won’t be a shock when someone tells you: “It was a mass murder and the shooter/bomber was a muslim.” We will become so used to it we will just shrug and say, “Again? Oh well, that’s what they do, that’s what we expect,” and carry on pretending all is well.Of course their cause is greatly helped by non-muslims who convince themselves that no muslim nurses a grudge or violent thought or has read anything inflammatory, though perhaps one day even the most loyal member of the Non-Noticers will realise that the Religion of Peace somehow manages to spawn a lot of lone wolfs who kill plenty of people.

            Yeah, it is not hard to imagine the weather forecast being modified into the Jihad forecast. “Bring your umbrella and body armor. In addition to rain today, there’s a 70% chance of suicide bomber in the forecast!”

        The coalition of weirdos and fuck-ups the Left has assembled is not the right tool for that job.  If you’re looking for a reason to be cheerful, it’s right there.I often wonder about that myself — the fate of individual Leftists when Leftism (in its current configuration) is not just discredited, but actively mocked and reviled.  I’m pretty sure that in the best case scenario, my little nieces and nephews will grow up in a world where quaint notions like The Backlash (TM), “-phobia” of any kind, mass immigration, feminism, and the whole identity politics schmear are regarded in the same way we view witchcraft and the divine right of kings — weird mental artifacts from the dark ages, stuff we can’t believeanyoneever took seriously, much less ruined lives over.  (Worst case scenario: Anyone caught reading a cultural history of the early 21st century will be denounced and summarily shot).As you so often point out, Leftism isn’t a set of policy positions.  It’s a cult, and the cult’s dogma can change on a dime without notice.  All good Progressives know we’vealwaysbeen at war with Eastasia, and when the social climate flips from “anti-racism” to “racism-plus,” the Salon.coms of the world will be out there leading the charge for roundups, camps, and mass deportations.  Today’s blue-haired bicurious vegan brony is tomorrow’sobergruppenfuhrer.But… will they be allowed to get away with it this time?  After all, the internet is forever.  Will there be Committees of Truth and Reconciliation, post WWII-style, going after Vichy Americans?  “Professor Jones, you stand accused of having taught a class on the gendered tropes of Saturday morning cartoons.  How do you plead?”

        Things I like to say out loud, in public:Islam is a set of beliefs, not a raceMany of these beliefs center around conquest, subjugation, and slaughterIslam requires gays to be killed and rape victims stoned to deathYes, some cultures are superior to others, particularly Western cultureWell, they got a couple things right – women can’t drive, and they own slavesMarrying a 9 year old is – kinda creepy, no?And many, many more true, non-offensive observations can and should be made whenever appropriate.

            Islam is a race of a sort. Polygamy and consanguinity reinforce clannishness to a degree that is impervious to advanced civilization. If a lion could speak we could not understand him.
Where disastrous breeding habits meet Islam they mutually reinforce each other. People of different ethnicities, languages, and forms of Islam may join in jihad against the one singular strange beast, and then get back to fighting each other.
