        Note the hate crime enhancements on the charges. Their goal here is to make alt-right ideas illegal.
The same FBI that couldn’t get Richard Spencer’s assailant sure found time to find a random Internet no name.
It’s good to be in the (((tribe))).

        This appears to be a federal indictment. Jeff Sessions can put a stop to this lunacy right now if he wants to do so.

                Not to be contrary, but the Daily Caller article identifies it as a Federal Criminal Complaint and it was investigated by the FBI. The previous Daily Caller article also identifies that the defendant was charged under a Federal statute.
This appears to be a Federal charge, which means it would be brought by the US Attorney’s office in Dallas. Sessions can put a stop to this right now.

        Eichenwald is a documented pedobear pervert and douchey drama queen.  The whole twitter scenario was clearly an act, down to the tweet his “wife” allegedly tweeted after poor little Kurt’s so-called seizure.  The truth is that Rivello had been brutally trolling Eichenwald for weeks before this incident, and Kurt, being a classic mangina, used the opportunity offered by the tweeted gif to play the victim.

        You got to ask, would they be going after this guy if he didn’t target a relatively well known and connected person (he was a high profile 100% Hillary shill during the election)?  If this guy went after an obnoxious blogger or anonymous weirdo would the feds waste time to investigate?
You’d have to think not.  It’s a problem when the rich become able to use state security forces as their private police and score settlers.

        Another lesson to learn is make sure your thought crime accounts don’t tie into your Apple products (and stop buying Apple products if possible). Twitter gave them the phone number. Apple connected the phone number to an account, and then handed over his online stored photos to find a selfie he took.

        You have to wonder if this is some sort of marketing gimmick by “Twitter”.  What a complete waste of time that thing is.  Their business model is to try and sell things to people who have a defined attention span of 140 characters…not even 140 words…and their mascot is a sparrow.
This sounds like something the marketing department for those morons would come up with.  “Idea!  Need juicy novel.  Villain sends death Tweet, gets arrested.  Lots of *publicity*.  Guaranteed 400,000 unique enrollments!  A sure market coup”

        For what it’s worth, there seems to be such a thing as photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights being one of the seizure triggers.

            Not to be rude, Lorenzo, but there doesn’t ” seem ” to be a flashing light trigger for epilepsy seizures. There is a specific test with varying flashing light patterns, colors, and rates as part of routine testing for the cause/causes of seizures. The third time a neurologist wanted to me to undergo it I said, ” No. Two tests have proved that doesn’t cause mine, and i won’t waste my time or the money. ” I now have a neurologist who listens to me. 🙂

            That’s well-known.  My daughter has epilepsy – her seizures usually occurred at night, when she’d allowed herself to get overtired and hadn’t had enough sleep.  But she could get minor episodes during the day if exposed to flashing lights.  Hell, just driving in late afternoon through a stand of trees with the sun slanting through them could be enough to set her off.  Can I sue homeowners who don’t cut their trees down?
Happily, her condition is well-controlled by medication.  Maybe Eichenwald should increase his meds.

                That’s just the point. For people with this condition, it is diagnosed early, they take meds for it and they avoid looking at flashing lights for extended periods.

        Welcome to the next iteration of “Rape Culture”.  As with the current iteration, it will be used to destroy your individual rights.  This one will be employed to promote the “fair regulation” of all public communication on the interwebs.  Sooner than you think, there will be a Zero Tolerance Policy for “violent tweets” and offensive posts on *any* social media site…. and then they’ll move on to openly  private communications.After all, now that everyone’s cell phone has been transformed into a Tele-screen, the sky’s the limit for intrusive government intervention into all of your communications.Toast their success with some Victory Gin, why don’t we?
