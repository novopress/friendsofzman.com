        I hope (and expect) that Trump will shaft the EU political and financial elite in a big way. I have absolutely no sympathy for those sanctimonious scumbags.

            That retarded elite exists because European countries are vassals of the US. So, I agree, Trump should cut them off. Maybe that will lead to a collapse of the EU “elites” and allow real men to take charge again.

            Trump, or any US leader, absolutely should shaft the Euro elites before they wake up because, taken as a whole, the Euro elites have zero leverage and nothing to offer. He would be a fool not to do it.
I mean, the big tech news out of Europe is that Bosch is going to run an ad during the Super Bowl?

        I saw something the other day claiming that Zelenski had sold 22 million hectares of land to Blackrock/Cargill/Monsanto et al.
That’s about 55 thousand square miles or 10 times the area of Connecticut.
They’ll miss that when it’s gone. It does explain why the deep state is so determined to keep Project Ukraine alive.

            I think it’s more than just the money. When people see the extent of the corruption and what it has cost them… it will be Mutiny On The Bounty. It’s all fun n’ games until people start freezing and going hungry. Accountability and competence is going to sweep Clown World away at some point. The only question now is how much blood has to be spilled.

                I can’t be as optimistic.
I say this because the US has wasted tens of thousands of lives, over two decades and possibly as much as $20 trillion in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other useless wars.
After all of that malfeasance, who has actually been held accountable? What penalties have actually been imposed on bad actors in those tragedies?
All I can see is that their gravy train just keeps rolling with no end in sight.

                    Accountability may come in Ukraine when there is no rule of law left. Early in the war, after Ukrainians being sieged in Mariupol surrendered, the Ukies, almost certainly at the behest of interests in FUSA/FUK, carried out a ballistic missile attack on a Russian Federation Army POW camp in Donbas Oblast, which iirc was not legally yet RF territory.It was surrendered neo-nazi fighters who were killed. WHY? Why would one kill one’s own when common sense would dictate that one should attempt to bargain them back through prisoner exchanges so that they could fight again? (subsequently, exchanges have happened many times)My pet hypothesis is that some were turning, not necessarily towards Russia, but away from the vile (((traitors))) who run their own government and used them like food animals for fun and profit. (1) Corroborating evidence comes from a mountain of posts on Telegram from Ukraine Army units, which are furiously censored as soon as they come online, but nonetheless captured first. The general theme is “You better hope the Russians reach Kiev before we do! They will just put you in prison. We will kill you.”I expect that transnational corporate operatives and their domestic Ukrainian collaborators will have short life spans inside any post-war territory not under direct RF occupation. I also expect that most will not be blessed with quick clean deaths. Some Ukies blinded and crucified captured Russian POW’s early in the war. Defeat will shift that energy onto a new and far more deserving focus.(1) Let’s be real.Ukies have never had independent media or free speech.They are like Americans but even more so in that have been adrift on a sea of lies since modern Ukraine was founded. Ukraine governance was never of the Ukrainian people, by the Ukrainian people, for the Ukrainian people. It is been owned and operated largely by transnational Jews since its start in 1991. Sure, the ownership has changed since the war. The big 6 Jewish oligarchs and the 1 goy oligarch left standing (they always leave 1collaboratinggoy standing-&gt;old pattern) have I think largely been muscled out in favor of tribesmen in Paris, London, and NYC. It is these who stand to lose the most, hence the bellicose policies of the American, French, and British governments, all of which are owned by various factions of the transnational (((cartel))).

                If this were going to happen anywhere, it would be Ukraine.  But Ukrainian leaders are not in fact swinging from trees.  Many Ukrainians are literally freezing in the dark.  But it is far easier to blame Russia than their own feckless evil leaders.  So they shiver by candlelight while cursing the evil Russians.

            That any corporation is rich enough to purchase that much land is an outrage. As much as I would be thrilled if Trump rendered the plEUtocrats impecunious, I would be even giddier if he could somehow kick the slats out from underneath AINO’s corporate timocrats.

                He could, but he’d have to take on that which he would hate to give up — lower rates from the Fed. Let interest rates float to where they need to be, and the asset/wealth bubble pops. It would be a necessary part of MAGA, but everyone is absolutely convinced that low interest rates are a good thing, when they really reveal a deep sickness. Spend it all now, even on credit, because it will be worth less tomorrow.

            Yep.British bankers… I saw what he did there, HAR HAR HAR!!!The fact is that Russia is the model for making America great again: get the jews out of your finances. Do it the easy way or the hard way. Tie your currency to gold. Take an interest in the welfare of the people that actually make your country run. Reward them for  supporting you. Remove or dispose of the people that try to undermine any of that because – as we’ve seen – they won’t hesitate to do the same to you. We are all going to HAVE to do this at some point.

                I knew somebody would bring that up. And I don’t disagree, but I was thinking more along the lines of how aggressive the UK is in pursuing this war long after their pull date as a real empire. Also, I don’t know about tying a currency to gold. See my comment on Putin the Atlanticist.

                    I heard in a podcast that, basically, the British and “British” were quite happy to rule the world behind the scenes once they lost their empire, and the City of London is the primary way they do this. Could this be true, possibly, maybe it explains why the Bond movies are so popular, it portrays a Britain that is still influential and powerful and making moves, but is doing so through espionage and spy games.We know that the Fed has been exerting pressure on the CoL lately in the financial markets, so perhaps they saw the Ukraine boondoggle as a way to reestablish control over the situation.

                        Take the hot babes out of the Bond movies and probably only 2 or 3 of them get made, if that, and they are no more popular than your typical John le Carre movie adaptation.

                            I probably shouldn’t waste time on the culture wars, but I would argue theBourneandMission:Impossiblefranchises seriously undermined Bond in the early to mid-2000s, thus prompting the entire Craig cycle of Bond films in response.

                                Well now that we’re on the subject, I recall hearing, perhaps from Barbara Broccoli herself, that it was Austin Powers that forced the Bond franchise to take the darker and more serious turn of the Craig years. But they didn’t eliminate the babes and the sex did they

                                Why do so many believe this?  Half of the crap we suffer from comes right out of the culture war.  All the homo and sex stuff all came out of the movies and the teevee.  Now even books are loaded up with SJW BS, especially books aimed at a younger audience.  We need more culture warriors, not fewer. It is certainly not a waste of time.

If the Buckley crowd had gotten wise to the cultural turn in the second half of the sixties and fought the pomos with anything like the zeal they visited upon the commies, we would be living in a vastly superior country to the one that now festers and molders before us.

                            I would say the John Le Carre and Len Deighton books (and film adaptations) are way more realistic than the Bond drivel. Both writers describe and capture British decline. I’ve heard that both writers were infuriated with the tripe that Fleming was coming up with (let alone the later film adaptations, which became more and more fantastic).

                                Of course Arshad, I’m not talking about the quality of the material, but the popularity of the movies, which for the Le Carre film adaptations was very meh. But for some reason, in spite of never making much money, they kept producing them. The financial success of the Bond films being exponentially greater, by several orders of magnitude.

                                Le Carre and Deighton were undoubtedly more realistic, but Fleming was a far better writer. And at any rate, Fleming was not a realist and never claimed to be. He wrote escapist fantasy for miserable Brits shivering and suffering from England’s post-war austerity measures.

                        ” …and the City of London is the primary way they do this”But the only way to make this work is by the UK being a subservient vassal state of the US (which humiliating condition the Brits make palatable to themselves by using the euphemism, “the special relationship.”). That’s probably why whatever hare-brained imperial scheme of over-reach the US regime comes up with, the Brits are first on board, and in the most effusive and enthusiastic fashion. It’s embarrassing to watch. The point is that military might is the final and only arbiter. Might makes right.The Bond films I see as a compensatory mechanism — these have been made in an era where British global influence has declined like a deflating balloon. The British might have lost the empire and have had to eat humble pie but by golly, Bond is around to ensure that Britain has influence in the world. These days, in jest, I say that the only person who can save capsizing Britain is 007.It’ll be scant consolation but now that France has lost “Francafrique” during the last year or two, the French are going down the same road as the Brits.

The Doctor Who character fulfils a similar function, I suspect.

                    Is that the “Atlantic” you meant, Tom? I am Canadian and have never heard of the Atlanticist…?If it’s in the Atlantic – I’m gonna have to take a hard pass. No disrespect to you… but I just ran across this piece of jewry via Arthur Sido – pooped my pants with rage:We’re Going To Party Like It’s 2017 – Dissident ThoughtsWe are all business men here, for the most part. It implies another possible scenario: Our Greatest Allies are now getting a serious negative ROI. Every single aspect of Project Ukraine has backfired. Since its implementation it has been a dismal failure for The Tribe. Putler is now stronger than ever. Worse, he is forging economic alliances with world partners that will not tolerate jewish perfidy, many of whom would happily kill jews in large numbers just for fun and sport. There is a groundswell of Americans getting fed up with the tribe and its antics too.Sure, the Tribe made some nickels and dimes in the petty rackets…but the smart money is on getting the hell out and stop sending good money after bad. ESPECIALLY if Whitey is catching on to the grift, and the nae calling isn’t working anymore.

                        No Filthie, here’s a link to what I’m talking about
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanticism
If you don’t want to read the entire article (which I wouldn’t), in a nutshell it means being friendly to U.S. cultural, political, military, and economic hegemony.
For a long time after the fall of the Soviet Union there was even a strong Atlanticist faction in Russia. It’s been weakened considerably over the years by various betrayals and snubs towards Russia but I’m saying this sentiment still exists and Putin still hasn’t entirely given up on that feeling that everything can be made nice again.

                        Russia gaining the upper hand? Nonsense. I’ve read the UK press almost daily since early 2022. Putin has died, or at least had cancer, several times. There is often a Kremlin plot soon to depose him. Washing machines are cannibalized for tank parts. Or was it fighter jets? Russia has lost something like 5,000 tanks and similar vehicles. Ukraine’s offensive is going swimmingly; there are often reports that Russia lost 1,000 or even 2,000 men in one day. Russians are defecting left and right, those who can’t hide from the press gangs, that is. Why, the Russkis are getting so desperate there’s talk of digging up the dead and drafting them.[OK, I exaggerate a bit, but really, most of those are what’s appeared inDaily Mail, Express, The Sun, etc.]

Zelensky will see to it that those videos  be shown on Russian state television directly.

        It’s always odd to hear the EU, NATO and Amerika talking like they have any leverage whatsoever over what Russia does in Ukraine. Russia won the SMO the day it started and will decide exclusively how the conflict ends. Given Russia knows the west is “agreement incapable” and never to be trusted again I do not see an outcome that doesn’t involve Russia controlling Ukraine officially to the Dneiper but practically speaking all the way to the Polish border.

            Russia is certainly making a meal of it. And if they cross the Polish border, it won’t be like Ukraine, with millions fleeing the country, including military-age males. The Poles will come from all over Europe and the world to fight for their homeland. They will fight to the death. They remember how Stalin halted his armies at the Vistula so the SS could liquidate Warsaw. And this time they will have the rest of Europe behind them.

        replace the word “invest” with “steal”  . the purpose of the nuland/grahm/kegan cabol instigating thois color revolution and war was to get the Ukrainoan people killed and driven off their land so they cannot oppose it’s theft. plain and simple genocide.they thought the sanctions would bring russia to it’s kneese afte they destroyed the Ukrainians, and that has not happened.

            Anybody who studies Russian martialism the past century cannot possibly believe that mere sanctions would budge them.

                Precisely.  The sanctions have only strengthened them.  Unlike we in the USA, Russia has learned how to do it on their own, and where such is impractical, to skirt sanctions through friendly States.  There will be no “going back” for Russia.

                    Respectfully, it’s not even about ‘smart’. Most are physically capable of pattern recognition, of manifesting intelligence. Most are profoundly ignorant of what is necessary to run industrial civilization. One cannot see complex patterns if one does not have an educational baseline. One cannot understand partial differential equations if one has not learned calculus first. Ruling and administrative class higher education across the West is monstrously broken.Compounding this ignorance is a staggering degree of arrogance. “WE are da elitez!” Those afflicted with extreme arrogance will go through great contortions to avoid challenging the worldview that constitutes the foundation of their personal identities. The flip side is that once they are dragged kicking and screaming by reality over that line of inevitable consequence, the demoralization may make peaceful change possible. Unlikely, I know, but I try to see some silver linings.

            It’s a cliché because it so often happens: Serial killers are caught by their souvenirs, the co-ed strangler is arrested drunk-driving her car, the passing of the family’s patriarch splits it into vultures and victims, etc.
Death is primary; lesser crimes are drawn to it.

        “English company that was planning to use an Australian company to mine it” Well, well, well, that smells like Rio Tinto. Very prescient article as I was considering putting a little RIO in my portfolio (52 week low over 7% dividend yield). I likely wouldn’t have pulled the trigger because the CEO is Danish with a financial background instead of a mining background. The last CEO was an engineer. One little project in Ukraine doesn’t stop the globalist machine, but you never know which straw will kill the camel.Danish CEO, British bank, Australian mining company, and WAR. What a world.

                I don’t follow mining closely, but of late shithole African nations seem to be turning a tidy profit putting [visiting foreigner] mining Co. execs in prison demanding huge payment of taxes etc. Extortion or legitimate government demands? “Legitimate government” is areallybig ask for anyplace on the continent these days, I suppose. Only thing for sure is some local honcho felt he wasn’t being adequately, um, “compensated.” It’s hard to believe that any Western executive would be naive enough to set foot in these waste places. Well, if he doesn’t get eaten I suppose he’s doing pretty well…For a lark, I bought 1,000 shares of (um…) Reliant or Defiant Gold and it’s gone from cheap to cheaper, $0.35 to $0.26 or what-have-you.

        You had Brussels and the EU Krew down the other day.  Bunch of arrogant, empowered princesses and the homos/soyboys that women in authority often gather about themselves.  Why?  Because masculine men make them feel uncomfortable, afraid, and inferior.Jezebel’s palace was chock-full of eunuchs.  Fact is — after this hag slaughtered most of God’s men in the land — it was her own servant-geldings that tossed her butt off the balcony.  Then the church militant hunted down her family and the family of that chump Ahab.The horses ‘n hounds quickly disposed of Liberated Jezzie.‘How this came to be is not all that clear but given the way the world works it surely required underwriting, which means British bankers were involved.’Yup.  London, not NY, is the real power-center of the Old Continental Guard that have manipulated much of global affairs the past few centuries.‘This is the reason they put a gun to Speaker Johnson’s head last year to get the $60 billion Ukraine bill passed. Much of that money was to make whole those who had invested in project Ukraine.’Make them whole?  LOL  That’s like making Somali pirates ‘whole’ if they happen to miss your barge.  ‘Making a hole in them’ sounds more reasonable to me.

        It seems clear that corrupt actors in the West – the Bidens come to mind – have been using Ukraine as a clearing house for dirty money.  Trump stumbled onto the scam and “they” went ape shit on him.  Putin got tired of the Ukrainians pushing around ethnic Russians and invaded.  “They” went ape shit on him.  So here we are.  Trump has no interest in using Ukraine as a money laundering operation, and Putin has pretty much ended Ukrainian ability to meddle in the Donbass, so the crooks and shysters are out of business.

        Another reason the EU is frightened that the war will end is that their identity is based on being morally and intellectually superior to the know nothing pawns of Putin who warned that Russia would win and that Russia is more than a gas station with nukes.
They shouldn’t worry because their media will present a united front that Putin wanted to conquer Europe and they prevented it besides it is all Trump’s fault.

        Here’s Junior landing in Greenland:https://x.com/gencostocks/status/1876652190699262433
If we gave each of the 57,000 Greenlanders $3 million each, that’s still less money than we spent on Ukraine and at least we’re getting something out of it. A family of four is going to be set. They could drink and drug themselves for the next 30 years with that kind of money. 😂

        “If Trump makes a deal with Russia, all those companies and banks that invested in the project will be left with nothing but worthless Ukrainian bonds.”
Now wouldn’t that be a great way to start a debt default?  Then again, they wouldn’t be able to use the excuse that nobody could have seen it coming so i doubt that will be the cause.

        Zman,At this point, if it isn’t apparent to yourself and the readers here that the financial system can not continue in the United States as currently constituated i’m not sure what to tell ya, but if you agree and see what i see, i think an article on what the next “crisis” might be to print up trillions to buy another year or two might be warranted.  When the stock market began to crash in late 2018, rates began to be cut beginning of 2019, and then REPO blew up late 2019, i knew something was coming.  Covid was out of left field, the question then becomes what even more insane thing will they try to use in the very near future?

                I had the same idea when they first started talking about it again, but i think it would be stupid to go back to that well again so quickly.  Also i think birdflu is more of a inflation mask.  Prices are going up cause we gotta kill all the chickens, not because we’ve past the debt event horizon!

                    I keep hearing about prices going up because egg supply is down. I heard this same thing a few years ago. But never, then or now, have I seen any shelves empty of eggs. Nor heard of people who wanted eggs yet were unable to find them available for purchase.

                        Prior to the coof, eggs were generally in the 80 cents range for a dozen.  They’re now 4 dollars when you can find them.  Fortunately my wife works with a gal who has chickens and has been selling eggs to us for $3 a dozen.

                        the shelves were empty at my local variant of Kroger’s before the weekend.  Two days later there were eggs, but only the store brand.  I always try to buy only “pasture raised” for my own reasons. None of those or the “free range”.  My minimum is “cage free” and I was able to get those.       I hope to get back to having my own birds in the back yard– they are not cheaper, but I prefer them

        Western “elites” at war with each other is entertaining to watch. The elites backing Trump are intent on punishing the Trump resisting elites, not because they resisted Trump but because they got too big for their britches in general. I’m no more privy to the inside baseball than anybody else in the peanut gallery, but my understanding is that when big money is threatened, assassinations go up.

                Those are almost certainly homeless campfires out of control. It’s become a perennial problem in Los Angeles. The Elites built their dachas on ridgetops with panoramic views, leering down at all the little people, not noticing the dense chaparral brush growing from the homeless camps, up the hill, to their garages.
They shouldn’t lord “over” the people they impoverish into burning trash just to stay warm in the winter. But why warn them? That isn’t how they learn.

            The “market” is no longer to be “fooled”, regardless of the Fed shenanigans.  Bonds are so far sold because the purchasers have little choice and the Fed picks up the unbought surplus.  To keep the charade up will require Trump to actually do something about the budget deficit that—at least—fools the world into thinking we’ve turned the corner on our profligacy.  Then we can work on how to (in essence) default on our debt, via non-payment, or inflation, or more likely both.The risk of course, is not that we do nothing, but that we—as Z-man astutely pointed out—create some phony crisis as the London bankers have to distract from the hard decisions to be made.  That would be war of course.

        Part of America First is cutting the European elites and the “British” bankers (aka, the City of London) out of the picture. It’s the only move possible for Trump if he wants to be America First, which are his natural instincts. As for his team, well… I actually think his economic/financial people are more AF than the other parts of it.
One thing is for sure, Russia has no incentive to cut a deal that doesn’t include the assets that come from taking over cities like the one Z mentioned.

        I’m no international finance expert, but it seems to me that Paul Craig Roberts is right when he says that Russia should get rid of its central banker lady, Elvira what’s her name. At bottom Putin is an Atlanticist so he lets her continue, allowing the West to set the rules. Russia has all the resources it needs to back the ruble. It seems to me counterintuitive to keep interest rates high while at the same time maintaining a wartime (or SMO-time) economy. That doesn’t make any sense. But there again, I’m no international finance guy. I mean the West is playing with resources it doesn’t even have (Ukraine’s) to use as collateral in this war. How stupid is it to play by any other playbook.

            Tom,I don’t disagree with your opinion on the Ruble.However, the GAE stole $300 billion from the Russians.  That is honest to goodness, fungible, currency and Russia is not going to get it back.  Ever.

                Mow Noname,I don’t have any opinion on whether Russia will ever get back their money that was stolen from them. All I know is that if the Russians want to break free from the dollar, they have it within their power to do it by expanding credit within Russia. Probably they can do it without any significant inflation. That’s what PCR believes and I think he’s right. Fifteen years ago I wouldn’t have said that but the proof after our own Great Financial Crisis is irrefutable. Another example was what happened to the U.S. debt after WWII. Poof! Vanished… or at least it was made irrelevant. Accepting this was just one small part of breaking free from my hard money beliefs.

        Starmer sent UK nationals to help Harris.  There will be no safe quarter.Why is Musk talking about the rape gangs now?  Clearly with Trump’s blessing?  The reckoning is coming.That Trump has been so quiet tells me that he is going to rip the guts out of the Europeans.  Hundreds of thousands dead.  Billions of dollars in cash and weapons squandered.  A fricking fake impeachment intended to cover up direct fraud, malfeasance, and graft by US government employees and elected officials.In the moments before a fight, you’re in the most danger when your enemy goes silent.  Trump has gone silent.

                President Trumpmusk is headed for a breakdown over Zionism and Jewish supremacy. DJT, like PM Two-Tier Keir, is an enthusiast for the nation of Israel, which everyone ought to know is a major reason for swarming immigration, globalist unipolarism, and other problems.Musk seems reluctantly servile, however, toward the master nation, and he’s already in conflict with TTK publicly. His irreverence makes him like an loose cannon, and I can already imagine him explaining to DJT why DJT secretly stands with TTK when it comes to allowing gangs of Paki rape apes to roam freely. If you stand with Israel, you’re with the rape gangs. And you’re in favor of “the federated union of all continents” with Zion as its capital.

        The EU is rightfully terrified that Russia will succeed in capturing significant parts of Ukraine. Instead of being able to loot Ukraine (and Russia), they must reconcile themselves to a future of expensive LNG from Qatar (and Russia). Meanwhile, their security is wholly reliant on NATO, which is starting to look rather ineffectual. Now Germany is “warning” America not to use force to annex Greenland. Pity they couldn’t muster as much gumption in defense of their own gas pipeline infrastructure.

            You are correct. It’s interesting that Evropean zombies of Israel are so often driven to madness when they believe that the Jews are subverting their nation or their idolatrous, Israelist superstition. They are oblivious to the irony of their quarrel with the master tribe of the master nation.

        Ukraine is in the Russian sphere of influence. Full stop, everything proceeds from there. It is in the same boat that Canada is to the U.S. — close cousins who have a shared history. The European Union has turned into a giant kraken trying to gobble up every fish in sight. Well the god Neptune has spoken and history don’t play that game no more.

            Yep.  The mistake was investing in the idea of a Ukraine that was not in the Russian sphere of influence to begin with.  It’s like a 55 year old autogynophile in a dress demanding that you call him ma’am.  At the very minimum you need Russian buy in and mutual incentives. Ditto Georgia, Belarus, the Baltics, and the central stans.  The only limit cases are Moldova and Azerbaijan.The other thing that annoys me about this project is why you would think collapsing the Federal Republic of Russia was a net benefit. Way too many unknowns about what comes out of that process, as we are about to discover in post Assad Syria.
