        “We are currently unified as a country only because Yankee culture dominates the political, cultural and financial high ground.”Perhaps this is subsumed in your comment, but more accurately we are currently unified as a country only because the Federal government, in cooperation with the Federal Reserve, has the capacity to print money from thin air.Modern America is best viewed as a monetary union rather than a political union. The individual States, formerly sovereign, have progressively exchanged their sovereignty, bit-by-bit, in exchange for the comforts provided by printed dollars flowing from the Federal government. Blue states have done so willingly and enthusiastically; red states reluctantly.The moment of reckoning will come if and when the dollar loses its status as the reserve currency for the world’s financial system. I am 50 and do not expect this to happen in my lifetime–it’s simply too easy to foment the kind of chaos in the rest of the world that leaves the global financial system no choice but to retain the dollar as the reserve currency.At present, the Federal government can paper over the financial consequences of cultural differences with printed money. No sane conservative should live in deep blue states like California, New York, or Illinois, yet millions do in large part because wealth transfers from the Federal government, primarily in the form of welfare transfer payments, insulate residents from the financial consequences of their state and local leaders’ political choices.This game stops if and when the dollar loses reserve currency status and the Federal government can no longer fulfill its role as the monetary sugar daddy to state and local governments. When productive residents of blue states like California, New York, and Illinois have to face directly the crushing tax burden required to maintain the blue state model they will flee these states in droves for greener (i.e., redder) pastures. That’s when the cultural and political sorting of America, which has already begun, will ensue in earnest.I view this as entirely positive. Once the cultural sorting of America works itself out there will be little need for an overarching Federal government. The United States can then revert to a Federal structure akin to that which existed prior to the Progressive Era. Financial history will have followed its arc.Thank you for indulging my comment. Your blog is one of the best on the Internet–always thought provoking and enlightening. Keep up the excellent work.

        I am inclined to agree with your line that nations are not going to stay the way they ‘always’ have been. A historical map of Europe, and indeed one of the British Isles, shows more than a few shifting boundaries and re-identifications. What is interesting is how, when the fracture comes, it will fall.The vastness of the States would have made it almost impossible to manage had better communications not come along at the ideal time. The telegraph and the railroad came along right on cue as it were. Orders could be issued from an off-centre capital (or even more off-centred financial powerhouse) and put into action in far-flung places, and equally reinforcements and equipment — plus news which cemented the event — could be dispatched with haste. All that meant unity could be maintained.But when that unity crumbles and the dissolving eventually comes (and I bet no president wants that on his CV) it will be fascinating to see what groupings form. I agree with Kathleen about not wanting to be stuck with the lunatic left (this worries me in England if all the ‘liberal’ dolts in London finally wake up and decide that the submerging of the capital into a third-world slum means they will rush to my neck of the woods) and all sorts of questions will arise about who can go where.If you find yourself in a state that wants to carry on as if nothing untoward has happened and the wholesale embracing of crazy ideas carries on, the question becomes how do you move away from your new home? The break up of a country will mean new borders and some are almost certain to be considerably tighter than the sloppiness that has gone on for the past twenty years. I would think a number of new ‘nation’ states will openly dislike immigration and once free of central control (either Washington or Brussels) will soon put up their own stout fences.The best bet is to hope that while free movement currently exists you can relocate to a place where, with luck, you will find yourself among the right people. But, it is a gamble.

        In a lot of Civil War era newspapers it’s spelled ‘Sumpter’. Isn’t this book a re-working of Joel Garreau’s book “The Nine Nations of North America? Or Albion’s seed, by David Hackett Fischer?

            There’s a lot borrowed from Albion’s Seed, conceptually. It’s America-centric so the focus is a bit narrower. Frankly, I think Albion’s Seed was a good book, but way too long. I think it is pretty much another version of Joel Garreau’s book, but from a slightly different angle. Reading both together is not a bad idea. Woodard appeals to me a bit more because I suspect we hold the same view of Puritanism. I’m a Roundhead-basher from way back.

        I got half-way through the comments. Maybe one in ten even tried to address the essay. The rest was just double-plus ungood duckspeak.
This is why I read very few blogs these days. Perhaps one in twenty can write something grammatically and syntactically correct. A further one in twenty of those can analyze and critique an argument. The rest just repeat what someone else told them, usually poorly.
Now I’m going to spend the next few days pondering the marching morons again.

                The people with the most creative political minds are the ones who have first given up hope, which ironically clears the path  to optimism.

                Your writing is very good – and I don’t usually do spelling errors – but jives for jibes and Fort Sumpter for Fort Sumter literally leaped off the page.
I guess the spelling nanny surfaced today!
Keep up the interesting blogging.  Have already recommended you to thers.

                    My rules on spelling and grammar for this blog are 1)If I catch on the second read I’ll fix it, 2) If the error is funny to me I leave it (gorilla/guerrilla) and 3) If the spell check on the device is going to fight me over it I let the device win. This is a blog, not a legal brief.
Sumter is a good example of #3. There must be a “Sumpter” in the dictionary of which I am unaware. Jibes/Jives just makes me laugh.

                        Poetry?
“He’d sell a rat’s asshole to a blind man for a wedding ring.” or something about like that, IIRC, by Richard Brautigan.
I think I prefer the ZMan.

                    Although the fort was named for General Thomas Sumter (the fighting gamecock) of Revolutionary War fame, the Sumpter name is far more common in the midlands &amp; low country of South Carolina among the former slaves.

        I’ve often thought that maybe after a major upheaval, such as a severe economic collapse coupled with the cultural disintegration we’re currently witnessing, the country would break apart. One day Uncle Sugar may run out of money. We have ceased to be a unified country, values-wise. But then again, thinking about state sovereignty, what we really need is a severely weakened federal government. We could remain 50 states, each sovereign but belonging to a loose and weak federal confederation. I like this idea much better than the country breaking apart, mainly because I don’t want to end up behind the lines with the Marxists/Leftists.
