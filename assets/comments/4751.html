        It is amazing to see how lacking in awareness this new cosmopolitan ruling class is. They really have no concept of what it is they will be ruling over. Lord Keynes was brilliantly on point at the very beginning of his career, until his narcissistic faggotry took him over, but he found himself again at the very end–” We repudiated all versions of the doctrine of original sin, of there being insane and irrational springs of wickedness in most men. We were not aware that civilisation was a thin and precarious crust erected by the personality and the will of a very few, and only maintained by rules and conventions skillfully put across and guilefully preserved. We had no respect for traditional wisdom or the restraints of custom…As cause and consequence of our general state of mind we completely misunderstood human nature, including our own.”  The “we” were his own the Bloomsbury group and all their kind.

        In ’96 I was very obsessed with the proposition that we were becoming a “brokeracracy.”  The financial types had a spigot in the money pipe and they we doing everything possible to make the pipe wider and pump more money through it at ever higher velocities.  Anything they could do to create more financial transactions and increase their skim was going to get enacted through law, through bribery, or through ignorance (mostly in the case of very complicated derivative securities that were very difficult for legislators and regulators to understand).Strangely, as time wore on and my hypothesis was increasingly supported by events, I lost all passion for my idea… I think because almost no one else seemed to get it and certainly no sane politician was discussing it. Low interest mortgages, ballooning 401k’s, and for a few, insanely lucrative stock options kept mouths shut.Here we are 20 years later and people are starting to talk about it.  The out of sight rich, like so many who have seized power over the years, are now casting about how to hold it.  Whether by design or evolution, they seem to be wedded to Burnham’s ideas with themselves as a very small “inner party,” about five percent of the population as clerks and specialists to keep things running, and the rest of us as proles to make fat on junk food, junk entertainment, and junk knowledge.I agree with El Polacko that they are in the process of some sort of population cull.  As he points out, the elites have long believed that there are too many of us.  I would call it a soft cull with mostly psychological weapons being used to convince the weaker-willed among us to stop having children, though in the inner cities, it is far from peaceful.I’m not sure what that portends.  Usually, tyrants go after the small freeholder class first (de-kulakization, various dispossessions from the Plebs to the Scots).  In the here and now, the first targets seem to be the weak-willed and unintelligent.  Lately, the information campaign seems to have re-doubled its energy, spewing out cultural FUD at a feverish pace.  The target seems to be (but I am far from certain of this) the remaining values of the small freeholders themselves.Finally, as an aside, the tactical goals supporting the plutocrats’ strategic goal (stay in power, keep the mob at bay) don’t seem very different than those Marx laid down in 1848: destruction of nations, religion, civil society, the family; the creation of the “community of women” (and in today’s world, the community of gays, and transsexuals, and…); and destruction of the small freeholder class (he calls it the “petty bourgeoisie”).Read it for yourselvesif you don’t believe me.  The fun starts in Section II.

        “As an aside, the obsession over young people is a strange psychosis that you don’t see in the history books.”Good point, but the reason I think is that people began to shun age and start to worship youth, starting with the realisation that the kids have money (or perhaps more accurately, could persuade their elders to buy things for them.)When I taught a few years ago, I was astonished how many of my teenage students may occasionally say revolutionary things but in every other way they were firmly materialistic. They would get excited by the prospect of ‘savings’ at the local store, and they all knew the price of everything.I accept though that wanting to see only young people on television, say, is understandable in that some of the untidy, decrepit old fools who used to be wheeled out were of no interest to anyone. Youth came to equal desire, so TV stations turned to younger anchors and presenters. The old were another country, or about to be, so the excitable and spendaholic yoof was the way forward.Every so often the Liebore party in the UK proposes that even younger people should get the vote, because the younger the voters are, the less they know and can be whipped into giddiness by the offer of a few bright and shiny things. The giddier they are means a smoother path to power.

        Its a weird world, the rootless cosmopolitans are in fact the kingmakers in America and everybody loves them for different reasons.

        This particular iteration of the ruling class has matriculated through the same educational establishment that is now turing out garden variety neo-bolsheviks without marketable skills, slow to marry and reproduce.They promote and endorse socially dysfunctional behaviors that they would never consider allowing in their own families or peer group.It’s difficult to determine why they feel it so important to endorse and promote the trendiest of alternative lifestyles, unless you take the pronouncements of the human exterminationists like John Holdren,Ted Turner, Prince Charles and the Club of Rome seriously.If the goal really is to reduce the human footprint, it is easy to see the current manufactured cultural preoccupation with homos and trannys, the canonization of the supremely dysfunctional and geno-suicidal black race and unrestricted international immigration as several elements of a internationally co-ordinated plan to set the global population at each others throats.The cloud people are preparing their deluxe underground shelters, already live lives surrounded by armed security completely separate from the rabble, and in the words of Gilded Age robber baron Jay Gould, if things really get out of hand, they would simply “hire one half of the population to kill off the other half”.
