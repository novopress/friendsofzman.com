        “The threat is the Western scientist who are willing to take Chinese money to perform forbidden research.”
For approximately the past two years, millions of people around the world have died, trillions of dollars of economic damage, global disaster on par with World War I or II, due to Eastern scientists who were willing to take American money to perform forbidden research.

        Off topic:  Good Lord, I think that my 10,000+ employee company in a red state now employs a tranny.  It is leading a zoom session right now.
This is collective insanity.  It’s out of the 1984 movie where O’Brien forces Smith to deny obvious mathematical truths to avoid punishment.
We’ve forced to pretend that this is normal.
I live in one of the reddest states and is considered one of the most redneck and irredeemable.  I sumultaneously sigh and scream.

            “In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.”…Theodore Dalrymple

            O was in Tennessee for some hand gun training. The ex special force guys told a story about a tranny coming to training. That story and everything about sodomites was prefaced by: ” Now I don’t care what you do in your bedroom….”

        I don’t get the love or hate for China. Wouldn’t call them a paper tiger, but they aren’t ready to the global hegemon. A multipolar world is the historical norm and nothing to be afraid of.
It’s not this virtuous place we should all look up to, either. I was working on high end bathroom fixtures from a European brand a number of years ago. Long story short, there was a decent amount of lead in the brass, when there shouldn’t have been any. Obviously not up to spec for potable water. Lesson learned.

            Concur.  The traditional people in Idaho are Reagan conservatives.  If a politician says, “Freedom!  Guns!  Low taxes!” they will accept unlimited immigration and everything else.
They are my people but I have to try not to hate them.

            “How much blame goes on Idahoans themselves?”This is one of the key questions that is too seldom addressed by the dissident right other than to hate on boomers.From my vantage point, when the gun cult started in the 70s Whites quit fighting back at the local level and just started shopping for guns. Buying guns was the solution to all problems. Having guns meant you were a free man. Before the 70s, guns were just a tool.To make matters worse there has always been a tendency in American culture to just want to be left alone and to not pay attention. That made the American people sitting ducks for their real pointy hat enemies.The only time most whites learn their lesson is when it is too late. Consequently predominantly White areas often vote for the biggest cucks.

                Only shitheads run for government office, so who the fuck am I supposed to vote for.. Guns got bought because people know, deep down, we’re on our own.  If Pedojoe decides to bring it, he’s got a war on his hands.  He’ll be strung up. as he should, a traitor to his own country.

        I disagree completely, and no offense I would argue that you are making fundamental errors of assumption:1. That the US has a military advantage when it does not — its weapons systems are outdated, its nukes likely no longer work, its aircraft carriers sitting ducks, its people weirdos and trannies and Chinese paid morons like the Chair of the JCS.2. That China is stable and not looking to expand into an Empire when everything from the Belt and Road to its atoll building to overseas bases to tech we don’t have (hypersonic missiles that can manuever) says otherwise.3. That China cannot even if it wants to expand as a naval power because historically it has been a land power. The Romans beat Hannibal by building a Navy, and other land powers have done this. The past does not guarantee the future.4. The nature of the Regime in China itself, which is basically one man, Xi, reviving an aggressive combination of Maoism with Nationalism and eliminating group collective rule for a return to Emperorship. He and he only decides, and commercial ties, other things are totally irrelevant to himself. Only his continued rule matters and he will do whatever it takes to continue that, including war if it is required.5. The nature of the Biden Regency: it is divided, with the commercial class wanting more and more China, the political class totally purchased by it including Biden and all of the Democrats, and most of the Republicans, and the military class afraid that as a Chinese colony they will be eliminated. Do not necessarily bet against those with the guns.6. The nature of any conflict. It could be non-declared War, somehow just to make a point all our carriers are sunk globally, with China saying it was not them, or perhaps the Regency just commands them all back to port as China invades and conquers Taiwan, and maybe parts of Japan, the Philippines, Austraila and New Zealand. Would the Regency do that for a pay-off? Quite probably. Any coup attempt at home would be met with immediate Chinese nuclear attack (our nukes again don’t work most likely) so there is that.My argument is that China has already won. They are a nation, we are ruled by degenerate trannies who hate us and want us dead, with various other tribes here all feeling the same thing. There could very well be no fight, no armed conflict, just “America” being a thing of the past and China ruling the globe without a fight. Consider this: a bunch of illiterate goat herders on motorbikes beat the US and made us run in panic out of Afghanistan. How can we even hope to resist the Chinese? Particularly since they make everything now and we could not even build a pencil factory. Much less supply our own auto industry.

            Interesting take.  The one thing I’ll take issue with is the “non-working nukes”; that may or may not be true* but I doubt that you’d be able to find a group of people who would want to take an active bet on that.*(Too lazy to find the article, but I’d heard that submarine based nukes, the ones that would primarily concern an adversary, in all likelihood work fine since they have to use materials with much longer half-lives in the warhead so as to not “bake” the crew.  It makes sense to me as someone who doesn’t have a whole lot of knowledge in that regard).

            The China-hostile and the China-owned factions of our government seem balanced or at a stalemate. They can’t accomplish anything China-wise besides taking turns selling us out in different minor embarrassing ways.
They agree, though, on impoverishing 98% and slaughtering a hundred million or so Americans as a necessary corporate team-building exercise.

        Whether or not the hypersonic missiles work, the next war will be lost using very conventional, and proven weapons (Wiki Starfish Prime).  Keep in mind what can happen to our electronics.  Keep in mind where those electronics are made.  Keep in mind that we can’t put a faraday cage over the entire country, and not over our carrier groups either.  If people are waiting three months today for some Chevy part over too much printed money last year, just imagine if something like that happened.Our only way out of this is a combination of tariffs and aggressive on-shoring tax incentives.  I’m sure the politicians will chose the other weapons and destroy us.  And, yes, we’re keeping the reserve currency for a lot longer than anyone expects.  This doesn’t mean that domestic inflation won’t run wild over the coming years.

            I’m eager to hear the counter arguments against Mr. Wirth’s comments.Educate me on why American self-suffiency and letting China rule the East are bad ideas!  I concede that these changes will be painful in the short term.If you say that we can’t be largely self-sufficient then I reply that this is our real problem.Finally, I don’t care if Asians live under authoritarian rule.  Their long history clearly shows that they are adapted to this and I guess that it makes most of them happy.  They are not Western White men with a tradition of liberty.  Don’t project your inner world onto them.  They are not us.

                    I grant your point about all pre-modern societies being collectivist, but don’t you see a difference between white men and everyone else over the last 500 years?
I submit that most non-whites do not yearn to be free in the way that traditional whites do and we should stop risking blood and treasure to convince them to be like us.  Like the Afghans and the Iraqis, they don’t see much value in what we’re trying to force on them.  Take them at their word.

                        I agree with you here. I just think “collectivism” is the norm historically and the Chinese understand thisYes we can keep more people alive a few years longer, more people get 3 score and ten  which is not a bad thing but the rest is just dust in the windMateriel abundance or not the rise of the West is tiny and honestly irrelevant in the long term of things.The Chinese understand this as well.Note this doesn’t mean I wouldn’t fight for a revival of the West  , not because its worthy. Its not. Its facing its doom.But because its mine.

                American self-sufficiency is great.
China has a strong interest in our farmland and agricultural industries, the Smithfield farms sale to China being the most notable example.
China is not blessed with nearly as much quality farmland as North America, and they were dumb enough plow a significant percentage of their quality land under to build ghost cities to prop up their real estate craze.
We may not be interested in China. Unfortunately, they are very interested in the land we live on.

        If foreign policy was conducted in the interest of this country, our State Department would be looking to drive a wedge between the Russians and Chinese.  They would be trying to pull Russia into all kinds of economic and maybe even defense agreements with the U.S. and Europe.

            The elite in the US don’t seem to be running any long term strategy, in any area, at best its all set up to win the election, what will the US look like in 10 years, in 20 ?  they don’t seem to care, dementia Joe doesn’t care of course, he can’t remember 10 years ago, so he’s not planning for any kind of future. I think the dissident right are different, we more or less know what we want, how we get there is open to debate, but we have clear goals, success is possible, even if it looks a long way off for nowChina and Russia have clear long term goals, and the majority in both countries support these goals, so I would expect success for them long term10 years from now Belarus will be part of Russia, and maybe a large % of Ukraine, that would make Russia the largest white nation in the world, people in Europe and maybe whites in the US will look to Russia for leadership, on is present path no sane person will look to the US for anything

Neither Russia or China is a threat, the West has been destroyed, Halford Mackinder’s World Island is where the geo-political  future lies and the best Interests of Americans lies in trying to rebuild this country rather than the global meddling that has cost untold trillions of dollars and destroyed millions of lives.
An American scale model of Switzerland , coupled with the raw resources could be an astonishingly place to live in 50 years.

China isn’t nearly the unstoppable force their propaganda projects.
If the West had real media we’d have a better grasp of that fact.

It’s the classic case of the boy that cried, “WOLF!!!” The Dissidents have heard it for decades now, and everything is just peachy, it’s only the Jews and Neocons looking for a new grift.The old nickel goes that the best trick the devil ever pulled was convincing you that he doesn’t exist. China is doing that right now. Sure the faggots and rapists and degenerate rulers in the Holy City are chitting bricks, and yes, they mean to turn a handsome buck profiteering off the hysteria.  I agree with the Dissidents – f**k them.BUT:There are honest, reliable patriots in the military, and those guys are chitting bricks too. These are not men given to panic and hysteria. They have been screaming bloody murder for a couple years now. Consider the field of artificial intelligence: the chinks are moving to weaponize it at top speed. They are running national competitions for their best and brightest young minds to recruit them into the effort. Competition is fierce, and the rewards are serious.The faggots and pacifists here in the tech industries at home flat out refuse to cooperate with the military at all in weaponizing AI and have walked out in protest of the very notion of it.The military is in huge trouble. They can’t recruit. They need bright kids that don’t do drugs, that are physically fit, and motivated. Given that the latest admiral in the US Navy is a creepy Jewish man in a dress – those kids are avoiding the military like the plague.Finally – China is buying our leaders. Both Justin Trudeau and Joe Biden dance to chinkish tunes, and no bones about it.The Dissident that chooses to snooze through the current crisis is looking for a seriously rude awakening…

        I got in a bit of trouble a few years ago when I quipped just a bit too loud in a Pentagon meeting that GPC (Great Power Competition, ie buying a lot of expensive weapons to fight China) seems a bit of a silly exercise when the majority of our antibiotics are made there. When pressed, I pointed out that it seems a bit convenient that GPC exactly lines up with all the expensive military kit the services (especially Navy and AF) have always wanted to buy. I wasn’t so bold as to point out that most senior admirals find themselves on the boards of major Defense contractors within 6 months (to the day) after their retirement (for example, VADM T. Moore, former NAVSEA cdr which buys ships, now works as a VP at HII shipyard).War College taught that military effort are just one instrument of national power; national power is welded through a number of means, represented by the acronym DIME (diplomatic, information, military, economic). GPC rationales are largely responsible for exploding DoD budgets, but the other areas (D,I,E) don’t appear at all aligned with a China OMG! strategy. So my cynical take (and it’s quite easy to become cynical after multiple Pentagon tours) is that GPC is largely an attempt to justify buying expensive military kit.The Marine Corps tends to venerate their past leaders in a way the other services do not, Lejeune, Chesty Puller are venerated. But the one obvious biography missing from the USMC Pantheon is Maj Gen Smedley Butler, twice (!) awarded the Medal of Honor, as part of a storied 30+ year career. And the average marine has no idea who he is, and my guess is the reason he was memory-holed was his post-military career primarily involved writing and promoting a pamphlet entitled War Is A Racket, critical of what today we’d call the military-industrial complex.

        Every time I hear one of my (otherwise) reasonable, right-leaning friends or family members talking about how evil China is, I get thoroughly angry. I do my best to contain that anger, and challenge them on their ideas without sounding philosinotic (is that a proper word?) or unpatriotic, but most people are just too plugged-in to the mainstream, and even if they limit their political views to those espoused by Fox News, they manage to maintain their position on the Republican plantation without ever questioning anything they are told.I think it is almost instinctual that people need a bogeyman to fear, that’s why we tell our children simplistic stories when they are young to keep them out it trouble. It’s a shame that 90%+ of the American population is in a state of perpetual childhood.

            People have to excise that patriotism.  They are patriotic for a nation that no longer exists and to the extend it does, is run by people who hate them.  Their complaints about China are usually retarded anyway, whining about concentration camps and muh freedoms.  “They throw their Muslims in concentration camps” and I’m like, and…?  We could use a few of these ourselves.  Just imagine if our cops could just shoot antifa on sight?  Granted, given the state of our countries, they’d probably use that ability to shoot us, but the principle, if not the target,  is right.

            I have to say, I welcome our new insect overlords. The Chinese are the most racist people on earth, and they have no problem expressing it — they routinely say stuff about basketball-Americans, for instance, that would cause David Duke to run away screaming. The average Han’s book report onKing Leopold’s Ghostwould read: “C-. A decent start; needs improvement.” Admittedly it’ll be cold comfort in the labor camps, but I for one am looking forward to asking “How ya like that ‘White supremacy’now,beeyatch?” to any of them who survive the inevitable shutoff of the gibs pipeline.It’ll be horrible beyond imagining, for everyone, but… there it is.

Is China flooding my country with illegal immigrants (I use the word “illegal” so Joe Normie can handle it)?
Is China teaching my kids that their ancestors are terrible?
Is China telling me and my family that we have “white priviledge”?
Is China taxing me so it can give my money to welfare moms?

            well, organ harvesting is pretty evil.  forcibly aborting babies is pretty evil.  i can go on if you want.  how in the world can you manage to read (giving you huge benefit of the doubt here) and not see that the ccp are thoroughly evil; evil incarnate in fact.

                Are they giving prepubescent children hormone blockers?America is Evil. The expectation here is that I’m supposed to ignore all the evil shit that happens here to root rah rah rah for the evil home time while they fight the other “evil” that they have declared their enemy.This is the same principle as refusing to vote and participate in faux democracy (therefore legitimizing it). I’m not going to legitimize their warmongering by ignoring their brand of evil and giving them moral authority to fight a different brand of evil.PS: legal abortion here in the US in the service of redefining gender and putting more women in the workforce, thereby destroying family formation and male/female relations, is just as evil as “forced abortions”, perhaps more evil, when you consider that there might at least be a population control aspect to Chinese forced abortions, whereas the American equivalent is blatantly a psyop that has left millions of women dependent on antidepressants.Not only can I read, I can also think for myself. Thank you.

Yes, that is evil incarnate.  And they do it to make money, and because they believe they are like unto gods.

                Who is insane?Me? I never mentioned any of those things. Nor do I care. It isn’t me who is being censored, nor am I a Uyghur.My point is that China hasn’t declared me a domestic terrorist because I oppose homosexual pedophilic reading material in my kid’s school library, or because I oppose white guilt indoctrination in public schools. I don’t have to worry about my daughter or girlfriend going to China and being raped by a Congolese man who is there illegally with an expired student visa. China’s problems are not America’s problems…. And if they really were, we’d be imposing trade sanctions on them and crippling their economy, (which is something we’ll never ever ever do as long as the bulk of our commercial goods are coming from there.)I’m tired of these distractions from the real issues that concern me and cause my own quality of life to be dimensished.

        The crisis du jour is indeed just another “look squirrel” distraction to cover for double digit inflation, $5/gal gasoline, and the impending massive expansion of the surveillance state. And, at the root, the only real crisis facing the USA is the cancer residing in DC and various corporate boardrooms &amp; financial institutions. The fish rots from the head.But the good news is that the cancer cells are still relatively few in numbers, especially as compared to the volume of antibodies that will come into play after the collapse. Ignore the noise, get fit, survive, and train. When the fog rolls in, and the jackboot are fully occupied with riot control, the day of remedy will be upon us.It’s the only way to be sure.

        One trick ponies, and the trick doesn’t work as well as it used to. People will see through it soon enough, before long cynicism will be the default. The world changed, the cause that brought them to power is long gone. They’re finished.
Just a matter of when the inflection point comes. Last one was 30 years or so ago. We’re due for some turnover, maybe overdue. The Trump election and the issues that propelled it say so.
Perhaps then we can start to deal with the end of empire and the demographic disaster.

        here’s the existential problem for the current ruling group:  as far as I am concerned, America is dead.  So I do not care about China, Russia, the ME, etc etc.   My preference is for all major US cities to be nuked.  I am just “lying flat” waiting for the rubble to stop bouncing.  How many are like me, totally indifferent to the fate of this government, or anyone here (outside of close family, and very close friends)?  Now that I know how thoroughly pozzed all of the population is here, I can ignore their plight serenely.  Hard to rebuild the world when no one will stir themselves no matter how hard you plead, or how many gibmes you spread around.

        The push to create a new Cold War with China, Russia or both just shows how our rulers never throught through their plan to bring whites to their knees. They’re like the South Park gnomes.Phase One: Destroy whites by demoralizing them and flooding the US with hostile non-whitesPhase Two: ?????Phase Three: Wonderful first world countryWe’re like the late Roman Empire. The invading hordes can’t think of a better system so they’re just hanging on to the institutions and policies of the ever-dwindling Romans. But without the qualified personnel to man those institutions and the culture/morality of the previous people that gave the institutions and rules authority, the system slowly breaks down.A new Cold War definitely is a huge profit center for many Washington interests, but it’s also a sign that they don’t know how to move forward. Or, more accurately, they fear what a society that moves beyond its Christian white past will look like, so they stick with trying to prop up that past with whites falling in population and power.

            I started to post something similar earlier. TPTB are getting a preview of what post-White America will be and it doesn’t align much with their vision. It’s too late for them to turn back the clock, and soon someone’s private jet will fall from the sky after having a difficult time getting off the ground. There’s much more to come.

                Our rulers wanted to destroy white America but rule over the United States of the 1980s.To destroy white American, our rulers had to flood it with non-whites and to destroy white American culture. They succeeded. But, obviously, they destroyed 1980s America as well.Neither our rulers nor their mercenaries know what to do now. That’s why they keep pretending that white nationalists are everywhere. It’s why they keep pretending that China or Russia is a threat.It’s not just to keep them in power. It’s because they don’t know what comes next. They’re creating Brazil, but they don’t want to rule Brazil. They’re terrified to give up the past because the future is ugly and messy.

                    “Our rulers wanted to destroy white America but rule over the United States of the 1980s.”Yes. And the only thing they hate more than white america is the nagging realization that without white america there is no america to rule. This makes them hate us even more. Like the cheating ex who fails to stick the landing then makes it her life’s work to destroy the better life we create in the ashes.Their anxiety fuels a scorched earth view of us; they can tolerate no survivors. Like the covid control group, evidence of what was and what can be possible.Perhaps why they insist on doubling-down and purging the last vestiges of white competency from every institution. “White rage” is pure projection. But it should instruct us as to what we will likely have to conjure to meet them in kind in the field.Even in the man-on-the-street level I see this breaking across the prog-leftist camp. The most rabid progressives I know reside on opposite sides of this precipice of epiphany. Two pincers of white hate only disagreeing on the frivolities of the crushing.The Portland-Seattle-Vermont delusional utopians who live in 85% white areas being totally dedicated to the cause of destroying white america as the ash of their beliefs in action blackens their own villages. They look around and see the forest, so much still to burn before Progress can be realized.Then there are the white progs already living in the various Brazils, surrounded by their betters, reveling in their prostration toward the progressive mecca of a diverse and most equal of equal multiculti civilizations. The wealthy ones enjoy the view from Elysium while the less fortunate enjoy the status of the right side of history. The air was already thick with ash and so of course they must destroy flyover because the progressive bounty is mandatory. The fake plastic trees are losing luster and so its Bozeman or bust!

                        It seems obvious that this is intended.
Make the large cities unlivable solely to get them to spread like fungal spores, knowing they will do the same thing to the new areas.
As the entities in charge are just a death cult it really does not matter to them the amount of destruction they engender.

                    I think you’re giving them too much credit.
They’ve probably never considered it, and still don’t today. If they did they wouldn’t be increasing third world immigration, but rather reducing it.
But yeah, it is what They want, but they don’t have the insight or critical thinking to realize it. No point having a Ferrari when there are no roads to drive on lol

                I’m banking on China understanding the situation and keeping things from going hot.
China has lot of problems – like a lot – but they’re smart and they play the long game. They can see that the United States is turning into a Brazil. And they know that Brazil doesn’t pose a threat to what they want, which is regional hegemony.
From their perspective, there’s nothing to gain from confronting the United States directly. Just wait us out.

Those white men accomplished something that still boggles the mind.  No other demographic on earth is capable of doing what they did.

                    They also have no choice. In the short span of 50 years, the lifetime of some here , China’s population will decline by half.
They really don’t have any way to get those numbers up either.
The decline isn’t terribly bad for China but within less than a century its population may decline to 300 million . That’s the 18th century population and while it will probably stabilize  its as serious in its own way a decline as we face.

                        I don’t care a lick but Han fertility isn’t high here or anywhere else either.Also unless they are expelled most of them aren’t going anywhere. They love the money and opportunity to grift too much.That said they may well feel the need to pack up. The rule of law degrades too much and ethnic cleansing  is on  against “Chinos” and probably low class Blacks.In California where I live the hatred and outright racism against Chinese by Latinos and  everyone else  including in government  is palpable.This is not applied to Japanese oddly enough, just Chinese carpetbaggers and broadly though less severely against most other groups except Filipinos.

            I think the funniest aspect of people who venerate the founding fathers is that they ignore how the founders used Roman government as a guide for creating the American government in spite of knowing exactly how Rome declined and fell. Somehow they thought they could do what had been done before, but get different results.

        I’m struggling to find any meaningful, practical differences between the US and China oligarchs:US: kids go to Ivy LeagueChina: kids go to Ivy LeagueUS: COVID passes, mandatory jabsPRC: Internal passports, mandatory jabsUS: Youtube and Twitter bans, Facebook/Google news manipulation; no rights to speech or assemblyPRC: Great Firewall; no rights eitherUS: 3000 oligarchs run the countryPRC: 3000-member Central Committee + Xi run the countryUS: masses struggle to survive, have no voice in system, rent houses from BlackstonePRC: masses struggle to survive, have no voice in system, buy apartments from over-levered crooksUS: military makes extravagant claims, turns everything it touches to crapChina: military makes extravagant claims, but has the good sense to do nothing but engage in rock fights with neighboring HindusThis whole thing is a grift. China oligarchs need us as misdirection against their property company collapse. US oligarchs need China to justify the next Afghanistan-like looting operation for MIC. What a romance……..

            PRC mandates a relatively harmless jab and AFAIK you can pretty much say whatever you want besides criticize the government. The population’s morals were utterly savaged by Mao and now the elite are using social credit and other measures to restore decency.
Confucius say: to restore broken pot require great heat and pressure.

            All very good points by Captain Willard.
I would like to focus on one point he touched on: I will start to take the sabre-rattling seriously once the CCP elites stop sending their only children to study at U.S. universities, but not a moment sooner.

                Perhaps, but universities in Northeast Asia and China in particular are basically finishing schools for the elite of the elite.  The army of students you see over here are the also-rans.
As well, some habits die hard.  China hasn’t completely gotten away from it’s “meh, we’ll make more” policy in regards to the lives of it’s citizens.

                Don’t worry, because that in itself will be enough to bring AINO to its knees. The dirtiest, most open secret in the ivory tower is their utter dependence on foreign kids, mostly Chinese, paying full room and board. The school where I spent my career, “Flyover State,” is an amalgam of several schools, from big state universities to small private liberal arts colleges to jucos, but the one thing they all had in common was, English was never heard in the student union. Walk around the shopping area close to campus in the rain, and you’d swear you were in a low budget remake of Blade Runner. A 10% drop in the yuan, and “American” higher “education” collapses overnight. And since there’s more student loan debt outstanding than credit card debt, kiss what’s left of the economy goodby. No need to fire a shot.

                    Had some experience with that at a local flyover state, and while they had a large number of Chinese, they were dwarfed by the East Indians.  Really, looking at the graduating classes I’ve no idea why white people support these schlockfests.

                    Several years ago I visited the campus at Harvard never having been before and found it, and Cambridge itself, pretty disappointing. Maybe it was seeing messy construction tape and piles of dirt that seemed to sprout from the ground everywhere instead of the stately Ivy covered buildings of every hollywood movie but more likely almost every face I saw walking around like urban sherpas with their ubiquitous backpacks was Asian.  Kind of shocking to be honest.

                Well, now that Chairman Xi has gotten the wake up call about the Wokies, the flood of Chinese coming here may slow down mostly to the PLA members tasked with scientific/industrial espionage. After all, does Xi want to run the risk of a form of Wokeism coming home via those students?
But a delicious thought… the leftist universities are substantially propped up by the full tuition delivered by Chinese students. Oops.

                According to an actual SF guy who commented at my place, Demi Moore claimed to have become a real SEAL on the set of “GI Jane,” because she whizzed in the ocean of going back to her trailer. Which means I’ve been a SEAL since about 1993, after sixteen beers on Spring Break at Daytona Beach. Later that night I sprained an ankle attempting an unconventional insertion on a coed; wonder if I can put myself in for a retroactive Purple Heart, John Kerry style?

        This latest nonsense about super Chinese missiles is such an obvious lie that I almost laughed at loud when I read about it. Same thing one year ago about yet another Chinese super missile that could take out an American carrier. What ever happened to those? Easy answer: They never existed.I remember some years back when everything was about “Russia! Russia! Russia!” The Rooskies were supposed to have a super sub that was far advanced over American subs. What happened to it?Outside of a few showcase cities China is “an India with guns.” She cannot even find a way to get to Taiwan 90 miles away. Cubans have for decades managed to float across 90 miles of ocean on rafts made of used tires.China is a paper tiger. All information about her is a psyop to convince people that resisting China is impossible, that we should all just stop trying, ok?

I like their bomb trajectory calculator in their strike aircraft that enables dumb bomb drops to approach the accuracy of laser/GPS guided bombs without the need to stick an expensive, one-use electronics package on the bomb itself.

        no matter how detestable the americans might find the chinese they should always consider the alternative, which is GLOBALIST DEMOCRACY. The 2 poles of globalist democracy are george floyd &amp; homosexuality(which leads to pedo stuff) so…the way i see it the russians are correct to ally themselves with the asians against the americans(not that they have any other options). Nationalism is dead in the west, outside of some keyboard warriors, history will not remember the dissidents, we might as well not exist.The only reason the western elites are upset with the chinese is cause they reject the 2 poles of globalist democracy, their hatred is ideological in nature, it has nothing to do with china’s military prowess whatsoever.

        “How about in the last great war, key industries were sold off to the Germans?”
I see your point Z, and it’s not a direct analogy, but you DO know GM and Ford (Opel and Ford-Werke) built trucks for Mustache Man’s (tm Severian) armed forces, correct?
And then there was IBM and Standard Oil.
Hey, selling to both sides is The American Way ™!

        I suspect the war drums are being rolled out and beaten to distract the populous from the fact that our government is trying and failing to become more totalitarian and in the process looks pathetic and foolish:– Mandatory Vaccination and the “No Jab, No Job” approach, which is meeting steady pushback.– A combination of disrupted supply chains, shortages of workers, and money printers going brrrrrrrrrr leading to either empty store shelves or increasing costs for everyday staples (food, clothing, fuel, etc.).– A hands off approach to Diverse and Vibrant! individuals resulting in increasing levels of crime throughout the country.– Leadership with senility or gross incompetence.So by all means try the “Look over there! Look at that HUGE THREAT!!” approach.

            The empowered science(tm) woman!It’s still not clear to me what a hypersonic missile is and what differentiates it from a hypersonic ballistic missile (the Minuteman 3 missile, which has been around since 1970 hits almost 19k miles an hour which is about Mach 24).  I think it might be that the hypersonic missile stays in the atmosphere, but then why do they call it a glider? If it spends part of its time gliding, how is that different from a ballistic missile?

                If it were possible to field a hypersonic cruise missile that would be a game changer to cut down defensive response times.
I *think* Russia might have supersonic cruise missiles.
I know all the main US cruise missiles are high subsonic speed, around Mach 0.8-0.9.

                    As it stands, no one has hypersonic missiles. The main reason is the engines. Conventional jet engines only work to a certain speed, which means ram jets, which only work over a certain speed. Then to get into the hypersonic range it means scramjets, which will not work below a certain speed. So far, reach hypersonic speed has meant using multiple propulsion systems. Then there is the fact that at those speed almost all known metals become unstable or melt.
The bottom line is hypersonic weapons are right there with warp drives and antimatter weapons.

Turn off your television, tell your children not to debase themselves with military service, and if the Left starts massive anti-war riots support them and if inclined join them in the streets.

Its highly China specific obviously and not for us but at least its an ideology and its nationalist, mostly in the Chinese sense of the word.

            Jack:  My husband mused the other night that, in addition to all the Han spies we employ in every government and military agency, the Chinese could very simply send 100,000 militarily-trained young men across our southern border in dribs and drabs.  They could already have done so.  How would we notice?This is, of course, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of Han already resident here as ‘good Americans.’  Notify the sleeper 100k army to mobilize, get instant ‘domestic’ support that takes the entire left coast up into Canada out of play, and wait for DC’s response.  Note that I’m not pushing any armed conflict – I don’t blame the Chinese for not wanting an island under imperial US sway right off their shores.  I’d like to live in a White America, not a multikult global hegemon.We are not a serious people, and Citizen of a Silly Country is more than one man’s nom de guerre.

                I will reiterate some things I wrote earlier. Yes, this is all a sham and just the mere threat of cessation of profits from China investments would end anything real. Threatening Karens with nuclear antihalation would lead to many nasty TikTok (a PRC company) videos. McConnell and Biden for all intents and purposes are Chinese lobbyists. The MIC knows full well what it can and cannot do and that’s why the Wars ‘o the Week tend to be against small and harmless Middle Eastern countries. Add to the mix everything your husband told you.Now here’s the rub. Xi himself suffered during the Cultural Revolution. The same is true with much of the PRC civilian and military leadership. They know batshit crazy when they see batshit crazy. The United States currently is batshit crazy.I and I suspect you realize the Karens and Clown World and all the rest of the circus are largely staged performances and the Ruling Class never intends/intended for that madness to have any other utility other than as a political tool. But even we see some of this starting to infest TPTB. China has solid reason to be concerned given the similar insanity it experienced, which also was a tool to consolidate power but got out of hand.The United States horribly miscalculated when it crossed the Yalu during the Korean War. China was a mere shell of itself then and the United States was near its Imperial height. We know what happened. I can see this repeated if enough of the crazies make some stupid blunder to promote gay marriage in Hunan or whatever. You can bet China sees that, and might choose to nip it in the bud to the best of its not-so-limited ability if it sees that as possible.I want to live among my own, too, and do so as distantly as possible from where there could be riots, rapes and looting let alone nuclear strikes. There’s another reason to relocate.I still think China will threaten Taiwan but not invade, and the two will reunify over the United States’ objections. That is when things get interesting for us because it is lights out for “our” economy at that point.

                    China quelled its Red Guard mentalists by essentially getting the Chinese army to shoot a lot of them once they got to overthrowing local political institutions,, and even then it took a couple of years to stop it.
I can’t see this happening in the US, as the army is quickly transforming into the crazy college girl with drones, tanks and advanced weapons, and as severian likes to say its all about crushing the h8ters.

            The very serious internal economic problems in China are important to follow. They are trying to shift from an export based economy rooted in cheap compliant labor to a balanced economy. That is not going to be easy. The Japanese struggled with it despite having lots of support from America. China will get little outside support, even if it allowed it. The scale of the challenge dwarfs what Japan faced. Then you have the severe demographic problems.

                I do agree with you here. If China ever poses an actual threat, it will be to quell internal domestic discontent. In the past this was done domestically with the Great Leap Forward, for example, but they could if motivated cause an international shitstorm now.

                looks like R/E development is fully 40% of their economy.  thing is, these apartments are empty, and economically inert.   also they are not built to last, and start decaying during the construction process.  so all the money they have been earning, has been wasted on unusable apartments.  it also means their actual economy is much smaller than reported.

        China and Russia can make a show out of trading with one another in their own currencies, but the rest of the world is never abandoning the dollar as the reserve currency.
That’s because the dollar is the only legal tender for buying oil on the open market. The dollar is not a fiat currency, it’s anchored in hydrocarbons.
In case anyone wondered why America cancelled its nuclear power program.

            This is also why general price inflation to this point has not been an issue, despite the massive increase in the money supply. The world is a big place so there is always demand for dollars somewhere. The current inflation is mostly due to the supply issues caused by idiotic Covid policies.

Or by very clever and deliberate Covid policies.
there is always demand for dollars somewhere.
As long as the US military can enforce the dollar monopoly, at any rate.
With all the talk about accelerationism and inflection points and people jonesing for a civil war, it’s surprisingly rare to hear someone argue that patriots should work to destroy the dollar.

                    Yellowcake is also easy to get. But it’s 99% U238 or thereabouts and you can’t separate the U235 chemically, because they’ve got the same electron count.
The usual method is high-speed gas centrifuges, like the Iranian ones (ostensibly) destroyed by an Israeli computer virus.

            Both Pakistan and North Korea have had top-class administrative infrastructure necessary to build and secure fissile material and delivery apparatus.
Iraq, on the contrary, had none of that.
Iraqi ‘State’ was a Sunni-supremacist mafia forever in conflict with internal and external adversaries.

            Pakistan had a smart fraction that was educated in the West and able to pull it off. They also had a lot of Western help. Iraq never had anything close. North Korea is a great example of how hard it is to build and deploy nuclear weapons. The Koreans are smart and committed, but without access to Western technology, they have struggled to get their program off the ground.

                    It’s hard to fake: the shockwave from a nuke is much faster than from conventional explosives, someone would have noticed. All you’d have to do was to compare the time stamps on the seismic sensors that picked up the blast.

                        That makes sense. I imagine the explosive charistics would be very different, too. Yes, the nuke would expend its payload faster, but a cave full of plastique or whatever bulk explosive they used, would just look different.

                    There is independent corroboration that they detonated a nuke underground. It also appears that while it was a success, they destroyed much of their supporting infrastructure in the process. Even so, going from that to a deliverable weapon on a missile is a huge step.

                    The best evidence that North Korea has a nuclear capability is the fact that the United States hasn’t invaded North Korea to deliver them “Freedom” with high explosive. Only nations without the biggest stick of all get invaded.

        Reading this while waiting to get into the secure building where I am a cog in the gigantic ancient wheel of the MIC,  every word is fact. Also fact is since the first tribe of cavemen threw rocks &amp; sticks at the other tribe there has been the MIC.Is it amoral?  Yes very much so. It is also true that if any three people are stuck together on an island soon two of them will be trying to kill the other.When I am shaving I tell myself if it isn’t me it will be someone less competent.  My personal stance during the last two hassles was that It didn’t matter if  my young boys went on any mission it only mattered that they were able to get back.The only way the the system could change is if the current ruling batch are fed into chipper shredders.I am more than willing and pray for that every hour of every day..   But human beings being what they are within a few years a new batch of evil will take root.  &amp; it will be the duty of a future generation to do what it must.  These thoughts are always in the back of my mind as I play with my grand children.  Ignorance would be much better.

        So far, the opinion of the average Joes who were propagandized into supporting Middle East wars is they hate China, but dislike any thought of military conflict, supporting shutting down trade instead.  It’s going to be a hard sell to middle America to wave Old Glory for a military more and more realize is a woke paper tiger that is more hostile to average Americans than foreign adversaries.That being said, support for military intervention to support Taiwan in case of an attack is sitting at 53%, though who knows with polls as they are now.  A strong propaganda campaign will probably get support of military conflict up to 60%, but will be missing the fanatical supporters that can keep the enthusiasm going, especially if body bags start coming back.  Also, the white southern boys that made Iraq and Afghanistan a success at first are going to be hamstrung to being helpless.

                    There is a lot more going on than we are allowed to see. The US media is as censored as Pravda under Stalin only less honestMore importantly the Dissidents refuse steadfastly to offer an alternative ideology of any kind and every man Jack of them just wants to punch Leviathan in the nose and go home to his own little patch.Even if they could win a fight they will just leave a power vacuum . No one backs a weak horse . Its a complex world and you break it you own it, doubly so for Dissidents.The Libertarian instinct is crippling because if you become worth and take power you must use it .In a situation where the the fictitious  Northwest Front or the Turner Diaries has an ideology and a “we are in charge” plan and  you don’t is a guaranteed failure.And yes I’ve read most of Lind’s Victoria , its only slightly more realistic than Aragorn becomes King of the Americas.The day the Dissident Right has a common ideology and the Assibayah to fight for it is the day they can fight and win.Till than prepping, getting hard letting Clown World  destroy itself (don’t interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake)  and yes even voting to try and reform the Republicans in primaries is all you got

                        Its a genetically  engineered experimental gain of function virus.Anyone with brain one is a little leery of such things as Corona Chan could knock boots with Hanta Virus  or its kissing cousin H1N1 and turn into a civilization killer or just mutate into something very nasty.Our reaction to our stroke of good fortune, it didn’t do that and doesn’t appear to be doing so is a product of a diseased civilization.A healthy one would be “Thank God, now let’s make the  abastards pay for that.”Problem is too many normal   people have fractured families if at all , unstable jobs, a brittle infrastructure and little hope for a better future .Yet at the same time have probably never never faced severe hardship or early death of people around them.That dissonance leads  them to serious confusion.Material abundance + control of most sickness leads to a rat utopia but its unstable.I guess even last years riot boys came to understand “in spite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.”People freak out.

                That consent is falling apart rapidly. They can still fake elections, but there is a law of diminishing returns. Fraudulent elections but full shelves and rising incomes are certainly chill and grill. Freezing nearly to death makes people angry, particularly if just a few years ago they had good cheer, food, and warm homes. Its why Let’s Go Brandon is popping up everywhere. And for those shortages the regime has no answer, indeed they are deliberate to punish the people for being White.Being cold makes people very, very angry. Being cold and hungry makes them desperate.

            Hard to imagine the US actually intervening militarily in/around/against China.  As the Zman wrote, there’s all kinds of other ways to apply pressure.
Not mentioned: expelling 300,000+ Chinese students studying in US universities.  They’re children of the Chinese elites, they’re coming over here for prestige reasons (and of course to SPY/STEAL intellectual property), and China is a face saving culture.
OTOH, they pay full tuition; Harvard, with it’s 10 billion dollar endowment, would never survive the blow of losing the cash influx.

                After reading your comment I realized that I, and others, had stolen your intellectual property. Please submit a comment that gives a name, address and amount needed to change this theft to a simple cash exchange.
In the case of the Chinese students, perhaps some of the research they could undertake during their US education might be in the development of compounds or techniques that would be used to erase the contents of their memories shortly after their plane leaves for the Celestial Kingdom.

Don’t know how accurate this is, but I heard not too long ago that, due to its huge endowments, Harvard could stop charging tuition entirely and it wouldn’t make a dent in it’s finances.

            The only reason the regime would need real consent is if it contemplated a land war and needed bodies for it – a draft.  If it just plans to wage a high tech war of drones, fewer bodies needed therefore no real consent required and it can parade around fake polls to its heart’s (metaphorically speaking as it does not have a real one) content.

        China this, China that. What is meant when the word “China” is used? Is it a billion plus souls going about their daily business? Or is it a government made up of American-educated apparatchiks that mean to take over the world?the rest of the world is never abandoning the dollar as the reserve currency.Really? If the treasury dept. insists on enpixelating trillions of dollars to pay off the vigorish on the T-bills it won’t take long for the US dollar to descend into an historical money trash can.The threat is the Western scientist who are willing to take Chinese money to perform forbidden research.The evil western scientists are probably getting US funds in exchange for their perfidy. It’s interesting that the US at least, considers everything, including science, knowledge and money, from a political perspective.

        Sure, let’s just keeping pissing off the chinks, as if there aren’t thousands of things that we need for modern life that are either manufactured there or the base materials originate from there.  We’ve done such a great job of outsourcing, they could shut off (or turn on) a spigot here or there and create total chaos – you know, kinda like the covid.  Sure we could cut off our markets from all the consumer garbage they send over here, but I’d say they’re in a better position to f us.  Today I’m reading the auto industry may be doubly screwed as the bulk of the needed magnesium used in the manufacturing process comes from the inner kingdom.  This land mass aka the (former) usa, run by idiots, is screwed.  And by extension, so are we.

The best bit of this is that you don’t even have to spend 10% of the graft on dummy missiles and non working airplanes, you can just have sciency looking equipment in labs to prevent the new flumaggedon and pocket 99.5%.Its just shouting to try and get China to open up to the foreign venture firms. You can almost hear the scratching at the woodwork in frustration. In clown world there appears to be no dichotomy in having your mortal enemy be your main supplier. Who cares, its a detail.China however, being male oriented,  does not give a shit about the media and seems to have learnt its lesson from the Opium wars and early domination by the mercantile vultures. Pity the west can’t learn the same.

        Actually defeating China would be simple.
1) Immediate cessation of all food, coal, and oil exports to China.
2) Immediate strikes on their major ports, rail hubs, power plants, and water distribution infrastructure.
3) Immediate massed cruise missile strike on Three Gorges Dam.
See?
You could have them on their knees in a month or so without any need for a nuclear first strike on Beijing and Shanghai.

If the West had the will and the vision, we could starve them out while rehoming/relocating production.

                        trumpton expresses my thoughts:  Why is China a threat?
Let them have their sphere of interest in their part of the world.
Bring our manufacturing back home and aspire towards self-sufficiency.
I’m sure that more hawkish guys will point out my blind spots, but I don’t see the downside to letting them rule their area, if we disengage from them.
If we can’t disengage, then that is our real problem.
Finally, I don’t care if asian people live under authoritarian rule.  It suits most of them just fine.

                That’s what you get when you depend on other cultures/races for stuff that you don’t really need.Almost all my first born son’s toys were gifted to us by people and the hospital. Every time I read the label, guess what? Made in China. I’m thinking, great. Again.We’ve ourselves only to blame to our mass desire for cheaply produced goods. And I reckon that we’ve given a fair number of chinks plenty of our education. And they may well have stolen plenty more.I’m in no mood for war – whatever it may look like – with China; but if it wakes people up, they bin off the consumerism, find God and form a solid white identity to rally round and preserve and build on what our ancestors left, then I suppose it could be plus, in this Clownish World of ours.I can pass for the rest of my life on Chinese made crap and imported, distrustful and – in fact, rather disgusting (Chinese personal hygiene?) – peoples.We all know we’ve got to fall hard at some point. It’s going to suck either way.

                    Agreed only to the point of mindless consumerism. China produces our pharmaceuticals as well. Even after Covid this did not change. This perfectly illustrates what a grift the war with China nonsense is. Think there would be sanctions against American and European nations trading with China? Me neither.

                        You’re quite right, Jack. But I am scratching my head, wondering “why?”. Why is it the case that the chinks produce stuff for our nations of such import? Was it money all along? Guess I’m expecting too much of our pols, but if we are going to subsidize lazy wogs on welfare; why not at least subsidize production of vital goods instead?I presume that the Chinks have resources and minerals we don’t – so maybe it’s just not doable. But it’s a damn shame – one of the worst things about the globalized world: you have to really on people not your own for vital stuff.Anyway, my words don’t matter now, if they ever did. Gotta focus on the practical matters of survival.

            The military technology and infrastructure gap between China and the US is massive. This is why they are partnering with Russia. In addition to selling the Chinese hydrocarbons, they are selling them military technology that actually works. Even the Russians are far behind on the infrastructure side. In 1974 the US was able to secretly raise a Russian sub from the floor of the Pacific. No one can do this now, 75 years later. One reason is we have sensors all over the ocean floor that allow us to precisely locate just about any man made thing in the ocean.War with China would be a disaster for the Empire, but a survivable one. The CCP would not survive it.

                “War with China would be a disaster for the Empire, but a survivable one. The CCP would not survive it.”I assume you refer to the “CCP” instead of “China” or “Chinese people.” Right now over there they are running a movie glorifying sending thousands of their men across the Yalu, with half of them lacking weapons beyond a single grenade. The idea was to pick up the personal weapon of your dead comrade and keep pushing forward. Listen to the bugle call.U.S. Marines, aerial artillery spotters, Pershing tanks, whatevs. The unlimited resource Mao’s generals asserted was relative manpower. So try this: the Chinese expend 10 million lives to our 1 million. Who cares how, sinking carriers, drawing us into ground warfare by crossing the 38th Parallel via their NorKo friends. Without getting at them cutting off all statins and blood pressure meds overnight. Or unleashing COVID 73.Just count the dead, how many need be invested in terms of your own, and see who cries “Uncle” first. By the numbers that might not be the “CCP.”

                    War isn’t merely about dead bodies, its about imposing a nation’s will on another nation. In a war with China, America can impose a greater drop in standard of living on the average Chinese than vice versa. They need food, we want consumer tech. Their pinch point is feeding their people. Our pinch point is entertaining the middle class and enervating the unhealthy and decrepit. That’s pretty unbalanced.

                        “War isn’t merely about dead bodies, its about imposing a nation’s will on another nation.”“Merely” is not a term I would use in this case. One method is seeing how many dead bodies the other nation can stomach. Imagine a nuclear exchange, using the casualty statistics I mentioned. Or more close to home, if COVID is in fact biological warfare, how many Western dead did it take to get female and feminized leaders to wreck their societies, compared to Chinese dead? I think the number in New Zealand is about 28?“In a war with China, America can impose a greater drop in standard of living on the average Chinese than vice versa.”I suggest you refer back to the Japanese soldiers holed up on Iwo Jima, or Ho’s men, pulling cannons through the jungles on their way towards Dien Bien Phu. These rustic soldiers could survive on a handful of rice a day. Americans were provisioned more like kings then. And now?

                That would have been true in 1992. Not now.First, our carriers would be sunk globally by the new hypersonic system that can glide in from anywhere, including the South Pole where we have little to no coverage. In hours not days. Secondly, the Chinese have lots and lots of underwater autonomous vehicles that form a deadly net around the Pacific, basically autonomous mines. Third they have unsinkable aircraft carriers — shoals built up into islands where missiles, UAVs etc. can be bunkerized. Fourth, they have their brightest minds into military research, ours are flyover Whites working at Starbucks while AA black and various weirdos take up their places in research institutes, the CIA, etc. Fifth, their military leadership is not trannies with medals. Sixth, they own all of DC, including the Regency, the Dem Party, the Republican Party, and much of the military including the Chair of the JCS. Seventh, their space program is more advanced and can blind our satellites easily while we cannot. Eighth, they have a nation. We have … a bunch of people who hate each other and want each other dead.The Chinese will likely sink most of our fleet just to make a point, the Regency will of course make sure nothing is done, and like that the American nation and its global security guarantee will be over. America has been a joke and not really a nation for years now, and its just a formality now to be exposed by the ruling power of the world: China.

                    Hypersonic weapons do not actually exist, so there is your first problem. This is a matter of well known physics. So no, the carriers will not be sunk by China. Second, China has no defense to our sub fleet. They have no way to track our subs and no way to counter them. In a  shooting war, China would have the same problem Germany had in the Great War.

                Agreed, but those countries will never be able to re-create what the West had in China from ~1990 to 2020 in terms of numbers, quality and price of workers.
The end of cheap Chinese labor will be a serious issue for the world economy over the next couple of decades.

                My cheap crap needs might be abnormal, but I find no-name miscellaneous parts and semi-disposable things are almost never from China anymore, usually Indonesia. The shift happened suddenly “under Trump,” so I figure he sort of caused it. Minor improvement. The recycled newspaper package filler smells less dirty.For things I expect to last, the best guarantee of quality is the ol’ MADE IN JAPAN. Grandpa would be disgusted.America makes the best stuff but also the worst and there’s no telling which you’ll get, so the label just means it’s expensive. Our specialty, when not homo-ing the globo, is turning Asian commodity parts into half-assed “boutique” goods. We also do that to Asian immigrants.

                    Reminds me of a fan I bought.  I was desperate for a box fan so I bought an overpriced to-do at the local Dollar General and it is one of the worst manufactured products of that sort that I’ve ever gotten.  Only extensive modifications keeps the thing from banging itself apart against it’s warped housing (and yes, I own more than one, they’re all like that).Someone on a forum somewhere mentioned the overpriced poor-quality goods from China that Dollar General sells and I thought “you got that right!” and then glanced at the box:“Made in the USA”. (Here it is BTW:https://www.dollargeneral.com/products/product-page.aerospeed-20-box-fan.html)

        Of the many problems of being ruled by stupid people, probably the worst is: stupid people believe their own BS. Obama was so dumb, he actually said that, out loud… and compared to Brandon et al, Obama was Stephen Hawking. That’s why theses like this – starting a new cold war for fun and profit – always rub me wrong. Norman Angell thought something similar, and he was right… about people smarter than Kaiser Willy and Nicky II. And if Obama was Stephen Hawking compared to Brandon, the brains gap between the Brandon regime and even Nicholas II must be visible from space.Eventually, in other words, someone is going to get carbon monoxide poisoning from sniffing his own farts for too long, pass out, and fall on the GO button.

            Whole thing has a Pearl Harbor vibe: someone comes up with a crackpot plan (1)Brutally attack America 2)????? 3)We Win!) but there is no institutional mechanism to push back on it due to institutional group-think, lack of brain power, and cultural rot so the crackpot plan goes ahead.  And that’s on all sides of this mess (with Winnie the Xi gulaging anyone he sees as even a mild threat I doubt a half-honest opinion exists in all of Peking).

                Given the propensity to false flags so beloved of the clown agencies  I half expect the US to stage an invasion of itself.
I wonder how long they could run the 24 hour news cycle before people noticed?

                    Reminds me of the scene in “Catch 22” where the Luftwaffe hires Milo’s Syndicate to bomb its own airfield. Because it’s the Syndicate, and everyone has a share. This being Clown World, though, and therefore fake and gay, the Syndicate has to hold 10% for the Big Guy.
