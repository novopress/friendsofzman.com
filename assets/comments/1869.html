        Lefty complaints about prison population always center around “non-violent offenders,” even though that includes people who sell heroin to school kids (and then often plead down to possession) among many other monsters.
Next time you hear them bemoan the fate of these unlucky pacifists, just say “You make a great point.  We need to let Bernie Madoff and all the Enron guys out of prison.”
