        ‚ÄúIf Trump can broker a peace deal‚ÄùIf. But it‚Äôs not going to happen. Two cheers for Trump and some of the people around him for trying. But as you say, Zelensky cannot afford to make any concessions. The European doggies yapping away offer moral support to Zelensky (though nothing more tangible). And the Russians have no incentive to make concessions when reality is being determined on the battlefield. The Russians do have an interest in appearing to be reasonable and amenable to discussion. But the eventual peace settlement will be on their terms, not on Trump‚Äôs and certainly not on Zelensky‚Äôs or the three European stooges (Starmer, Macron, Merz). In conclusion, let me curse the name of Biden, that worthless piece of shit, who took us to the precipice of nuclear apocalypse.

            Great analysis. I still think peace could break out. Zelensky will just have to give Putin the 4 oblasts and Crimea and agree not to join NATO. A year ago, this would have seemed far-fetched. Today it‚Äôs maybe 3-1 against. Not bad.

                Putin would a moron to take that deal. He needs the entire Ukrainian coastline at minimum. Honestly, the collapse of the Ukraine into parts would be his best scenario. Besserabia to Maldova or Romania, Carpathain Ruthenia to Hungary, Lvov to Poland and a rump Ukraine as a second Belarus. Letting NATO countries tear off chunks would cement the peace deal.
It may take another 5 years, but that‚Äôs the only thing keeping NATO neocons from coming back again in the 2030s.

                    I think he needs to take Odessa, if only because of how the Ukes treated the ethnic Russians in ‚Äô14-‚Äô16. Which would mean, yeah, the coastline. That‚Äôs fine, though. Lots of countries get by just fine without coastline.

            Could be. But Trump ‚Äúwins‚Äù anyway. While blaming the loss on Bidet was problematic, as the Dems set Trump up for losing the war because he stopped the funding, blaming the failure to negotiate an end on Euro yappy dogs would be easy. No more difficult than revealing the actual numbers of men and materiel lost so far.
It‚Äôs Z and the Euros who refuse to look reality in the face. Delusional. Checkmate.

            Hrrrrrmmmmmm.I dunno, AA. In the real world this war has been over for the last two years. It could be argued that it was over the day it started. What we‚Äôre seeing today are the sporadic kicks and twitches of a dying corpse. This war formally ends only one way. The Kraine has been destroyed. Germany has been de-industrialized. Fwance and Britain teeter on the edge of collapse.If the only thing standing in the way of the inevitable is Zelensky ‚Äì make no mistake. He will disappear and no one will miss him. If I were him I would bail out right fricken now,myself. I will bet that much like The Scrooge ‚Äì Zelensky is haunted by Nikolae Ceauscu at night.This problem is the crux of the conflict. There are too many morons around that think the Kraine can still pull off a win. They likewise think that the west is still powerful and capable despite the horrible reality of diving enlistment and talent retention of the experienced vets.Blumpf has to wait until that Overton Window moves. It‚Äôs certainly starting too, thankfully.

            Excellent comment. It‚Äôs the Russians who will have the final word on this one. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason why they should accept any deal offered by Trump and West, considering how many the latter have broken. And even if a deal is signed that satisfies the Russians, who‚Äôs to say that the next bunch of neocon scum in office won‚Äôt renege on it. We talk about Zelensky‚Äôs head being on the block, but so is Putin‚Äôs if he accepts anything less than total victory in Ukraine. That means continuing to the Dnieper and taking Odessa so the Nudelmans can no longer play their games in Romania and Moldova.

                There‚Äôs a parallel between the situation we face and the one Russia is dealing with. There‚Äôs a real need, both in US politics and the geopolitical situation in Ukraine, for a permanent solution, not simply a present day ‚Äúwin‚Äù. Ukraine must be largely dismantled and what‚Äôs left turned over to a pro-Russian puppet regime or just rolled (back) into Russia itself. In the US, Trump/Vance need to set up their own equivalent of United Russia (Putin‚Äôs political party) to insure that the Demoncrats remain permanently handicapped and out of power. This means purging the GOP of Republicucks and building the ‚Äúnew Uniparty‚Äù. The old Boomer-ish idea of the parties taking turns running things is done. The Dems were using mass migration and dirty tricks to lock us permanently out of power. It‚Äôs time to use our current advantages and do that to them before they even have a chance to return to power. Will this involve dirty tricks and ‚Äúun-democratic‚Äù behavior? Yes it will ‚Äì boohoo.I think the pro-Trump oligarchs should be in favor of this. Businessmen want guarantees and you can‚Äôt get that by having a referendum on sanity every 2-4 years with most of the voters being wammen, fags, and third world trash.

        It is ridiculous we‚Äôre in this position to begin with. We should have dissolved NATO after the Soviet Union broke up. Instead, we jammed it down the Russians throats and right up to their border. How would we have reacted if the United States had broke apart and Texas or California joined the Warsaw Pact? Going to war with Russia is insane and I hope Trump manages to get it settled or get us out.

            ‚ÄúWe should have dissolved NATO after the Soviet Union broke up.‚Äù
While true, the Wizards of Smart (to steal from Rushbo) were able to convince the political class that USSR was going to reconstitute itself Any Day Now(TM).
They are still able to do so. Look at how all the smart people insisted that Russia was going to take over Ukraine, then all of Eastern Europe, then the rest of Europe. Any Day Now.(TM)

        All I care about is that it ends. Blessed are the peacemakers, Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount.I‚Äôm tired of Ukrainians and Russians dying because of our bumbling interference.

            Same here but it wasn‚Äôt really our ‚Äúbumbling interference‚Äù so much as a very old blood libel coming out at an opportune time. Surely you read this board enough to know the ‚Äòtribal proclivities‚Äô of those who ginned up this, ANOTHER brother war in Europe, that thing they just love to do at any opportunity (See WW1 &amp; WW2)The thing they love to see the most as the world around us gets browner and browner by the decade.I‚Äôm less than 8 hours drive away from the Ukrainian border right now so I see this in technicolor all around me.I, quite literally, have a Ukrainian war refugee upstairs in my bed right now. She has been trained to hate Russians with the fire of a 1000 burning suns because of relentless unending (((propaganda))).How do I go about telling her that her male family members that are trapped there are not fighting some patriotic fight against a animalistic savage aggressor as she has been trained to believe for at least the past 15 year or so? How do I deprogram her that she is watching instead a completely Western backed blood libel, banker‚Äôs war, and an egregious river of corruption and dirty money? Not sure! May as well ask me how to deprogram Western wahmen from assuming they are ‚Äòoppressed‚Äô under a ‚Äòruthless patriarchy‚Äô when in fact their feet don‚Äôt touch the ground and they are the most protected creature to have ever walked the earth in any generation.And how do we make sense of all the ‚ÄòEastern European‚Äô and Slavic blood (read: White) that has been watering the fields of Ukraine over the past few years? It is a tragedy once again that we‚Äôve let these tribals spill that much of our blood, it makes me sad.I‚Äôve met several Ukrainians in the past few months, all war refugees being this close to their border, the propaganda has been amazingly effective. Our State Department, CIA, and their tribal liaisons have really done good work, I dare not speak the truth to them but it distresses me that I cannot. One was a really good looking 18 year old kid who is stuck waiting tables for peanuts to escape being killed on the battlefield instead. That should anger you. He should be in university and on the way to building a White family, but we can‚Äôt have those now can we?? Far better for him to be a literal refugee who gets NO help unlike the mystery meat that crosses our borders by the millions.Russians? Met some of those too- interestingly, they have a take far closer to reality. They feel that their ‚Äòcousins‚Äô are misguided and fell for Western Tricks promising much but getting little and to break ties with those that they are genetically and culturally much closer with. Can‚Äôt say any of that is terribly inaccurate, can we?In both cases‚Äì I quietly listen to them, but these are not talking heads, these are real human beings who are living through this. Average Russkies and Ukies are not so different and they know it, and want the killing to stop. So should you‚Ä¶

                I agree with your point, but this definitely wasn‚Äôt a proxy war waged by brilliant minds. It was ham-handed and just frankly idiotic.

                Rubio is a male bound concubine. Either his (former?) master, that Jewish real estate magnate in Florida, has changed sides, or more likely he is now simply bound to a different master. Zelensky was much the same, being Kolomoisky‚Äôs (a Ukraine-based Jewish oligarch) creature early on and transitioning to being the City of London‚Äôs (transnational Jewish oligarchs) creature once their money and close protection detail moved into Ukraine in earnest. Regardless, you are spot on to give him no credit.

        As we often say on the links, it‚Äôs sometimes better to be lucky than good.  The fact is, the stuff Trump is doing and trying to do are things absolutely no other politician in this country would even attempt ‚Äì even if they really wanted to.  It‚Äôs the main reason I‚Äôm so tired of all the Trump bashing.  He is literally the only option to get anything at all done that favors or might favor the American people.

                    He‚Äôs truly uncanny in that respect. Something I noted long before he became president. A stopped clock is right twice a day but Joe, I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs ever been right once in his entire public life. Not even once. And it‚Äôs not as if it was a big secret. His selection as VP was considered a joke by everyone, both right and left. Yet a few short years later suddenly he‚Äôs touted as presidential material, and steal or no steal, tens of millions actually voted for him. I think their sail foams turned their brains to mashed potatoes. They have the memory of goldfish. Completely controlled by The Current Thing. I think it was this even more than TDS that did it. Only a truly sick society could have such a man as president. And that‚Äôs before we‚Äôve even said anything about kiddie sniffing, showers with Ashley, and Tara Reade.

        i am also expecting a disorderly collapse of NATO sooner or later. The core claim of NATO is that it is so strong that Russians would shake in boots hearing it‚Äôs name. Instead the NATO countries are now worried that some chihuahua like Estonia will get all of them into a war.
just yesterday Estonians were trying to steal a ship sailing to Russia, and Russian bombers showed up. This is unsustainable.

            Time for us to cut the ties with NATO. If we leave, it‚Äôll unravel like a sweater with a pulled thread. The European ‚Äúdemocracies‚Äù have cut their militaries to the point of absurdity where the Russians, if they wanted, could take all of that land with little trouble. We‚Äôre talking hundreds of tanks, attack helicopters and fighter aircraft for NATO against thousands for the Russians.
But they won‚Äôt ever do that. Far easier to let the European ‚Äúdemocracies‚Äù implode because they‚Äôre importing millions of hostile foreigners at the expense of their native populations.

                Outside of a Tom Clancy fantasy, I don‚Äôt believe NATO ever really had a chance against the Russians (without using nukes). Which is as true today as it ever was. But drones have changed the potential battlefield. Against which, Russia‚Äôs conventional superiority may not be worth much more than the GAE‚Äôs is against the Houthis.

                US can not cut ties with NATO, because NATO is the tool that makes the Euro countries vassals to the US. Americans have their military in Euro countries, not the other way around. If some Euro country starts barking too loud, that is all it can do ‚Äì bark. No real action happens without the US.

            Compared with some of the past attempts, this Estonian gambit seems weak. Putin is the world champion of not taking the bait.

                Estonia is lucky they still have their language and can makeverivorst.
They should count their blessings and realize their good fortune. But most of Estonians I know hate Russia and ‚Äúthe Soviet Time‚Äù with a passion‚Ä¶some refuse to even speak Russian, and 45% of Tallinn is ethnically Russian. Instead of being thankful that they survived while other countries have not (Scotland, Prussia, Tibet, Kurdistan‚Ä¶) they instead act like the weak little dork that makes friends with the school bully (NATO).

None of the Baltic poodles covered themselves in glory resisting the Nazis and were enthusiastic collaborators for the most part.

                It‚Äôs funny that the Baltic midgets and Poland are building their own Maginot Lines to stop Russian invasions and to take advantage of all those wonderful graft opportunities with all the MIC money sloshing around with no oversight. They all know that Russia won‚Äôt invade and it‚Äôs all just performance art by the kleptocrats for the benefit of the rubes.Also, especially in the Balkans, they‚Äôre still pissed off that Germany lost WW II.

                    You‚Äôre not supposed to say that about the Balkans. Look at all the countries that discretely joined up with‚Ä¶er, I mean surrendered in terror to the Hun Menace.
Weird, isn‚Äôt it, how most of the French Resistance were Communist criminal gangs. My French ‚Äúuncle‚Äù told me this, as his choice was join them or join the Foreign Legion. (He chose the Legion, and served in Africa. His face would screw up in distate whenever blacks were mentioned.)
p.s.- special thanks to Zoar for pointing out the Italians, with Rommel as a expeditionary force.  I hadn‚Äôt known that.

                    I fast typed the above and meant Baltics but Balkans works too. The only non-enthusiastic collaborators with Germany there were Tito‚Äôs Communist partisans. The Croats and Bosnians couldn‚Äôt suck up to the Nazis enough.
The Baltic countries were pretty much Nazi as they could be, providing soldiers and camp guards and ratting on any Russian who was fighting the Nazis. From what I can tell the Soviet Army was fairly gentle with the people there after they took the Baltics back.

            Yeah, this won‚Äôt happen until there is a crisis or an epic failure. It‚Äôs pretty clear that Merz/Macron/Starmer have been scheming to put boots on the ground in Ukraine (beyond the special forces already there). This could still happen later this summer if negotiations fail. We could have an ‚ÄúOctober special‚Äù just like the Kruschev days. This Euro generation of leaders are ‚Äúall in‚Äù on NATO and won‚Äôt fold a terrible hand.

                Judas Priest. They just want to kill off more white Europeans so they can pack more duskies in to sustain the regime, sounds like.
They don‚Äôt seem to realize that soon enough the duskies will be voting for themselves, so it‚Äôs a Pyrrhic victory. They‚Äôre signing their own death warrants, and their grandkids‚Äô too.

        Actually, the Russians orchestrated this outcome for the expressed purpose of creating a face-saving exit for Trump. He wasn‚Äôt either smart or lucky, just skillfully manipulated. But it‚Äôs a win-win nonetheless, and it will bring the war to an end sooner thereby saving hundreds of thousands of lives. The ultimate goal for Russia is a NATO retreat from Eastern Europe and a new security agreement with the West. Trump will partner on that also, and then new nuclear arms limitation treaties will happen. The European Central Banks will not survive this Renaissance of sanity.

            Yes Tom, for sure Putin maneuvered Trump into this position. But Trump was smart enough to seize the opportunity. The drooling Biden or cackling Harris would‚Äôve never been in this position. What will save the ECBs is not going bankrupt in an arms race. They have enough problems with all the imported savages on welfare.

            Yep, TomA, sage insight.  Putin‚Äôs running the show here.  Trump may very well be willing‚Äîand can‚Äîmake nice with Russia, if and when, the Uke conflict is solved.  Putin and Trump scratching each other‚Äôs back so to speak.  I‚Äôm all for it myself.  Never did I imagine before this conflict that we‚Äôd see a war such as this again.  Shades of WWII.

            I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs quite true. At least it‚Äôs not that simple. Z and the Euros got the ball rolling with their cease-fire while insisting on Russian retreat and war tribunals. Complete non-starters. Putin counter-offered to meet, um, today in Istanbul to continue the talks that Z walked out of. Which gave Trump the opportunity to play the ‚ÄúNegotiate or you are on your own‚Äù card.
It‚Äôs not so much that Putin is a master strategist, but just that Z and the Euros can‚Äôt see a rake on the ground without going over and stepping on it.

            The ECBs may not if Russia and friends adopt the mBridge, China‚Äôs alternative to SWIFT (and already at work in 10 countries in Asia‚Äôs shipping lanes and the Mideast.)Especially since the main central banks are mired in a rickety derivatives, debt swap, and ‚Äòbasis trade‚Äô (futures hedging) counterparty house of cards.Tariffs like Smoot-Hawley didn‚Äôt cause the Great Depression, it was when four major European banks defaulted that did. After WW1, Europe got to where it could no longer buy our products, so our exports collapsed, which made our overleveraged internal credit collapse.In the meantime, the Weimar depradations had led to the predatory Creditanstalt raid on Austria‚Äôs banks in 1931, which led to the raid on the cash in American banks (Treasury vehiclesphysically emptied and transportedlocal depositors‚Äô cash back to DC, so our banks were literally empty) and FDR‚Äôs gold confiscation and revaluation after his election in ‚Äô32. (The enduring myth of Smoot-Hawley, unlike the common tariffs immediately before it, was a way to blame Hoover and the Republicans.)After the banks were re-monitized, my grandfather got a reimbursement check for 37 cents over 2 years later, far less than what he had put in prior to the revaluation. That‚Äôs why nobody had any cash to buy anything.The Biden admin pushing us to the edge of nuclear catastrophe was one thing, but it may have been a repeat of the 2008 derivatives cascade failure that our rulers truly feared. Covid had bought time, but hadn‚Äôt solved the problem.Maybe Ukraine was one sink to bleed off some of the pressure? Or at least get our politicos some money to run.

            As one of their hillbilly ethnic cousins, I‚Äôve always wanted to go to Russia to see the ancestral motherland. Of course, they will consider me an American when I‚Äôm there, but I do have a warm spot for their nation, whether it is justified or not.

                As a tourist you‚Äôre unlikely to have much trouble. It‚Äôs a great country to visit. Most of the expats here think the country is extremely friendly. Problem is, they don‚Äôt speak the language and don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs often said about them.

            That‚Äôs a relief. Years ago, when I asked the Czech about making a run with him across EE to the Russian border, he said, ‚Äúthe Russians will cut your throat just for having an American accent.‚Äù

                I‚Äôm a former member of Russian aviation societies. I used to visit, fly and hang out there, and I read, write and speak the language modestly well.
Circa 2005, Russian attitudes toward Americans soured grievously. It may have arose from the Shrub/Cheney cowboy arrogance.
They won‚Äôt cut your throat, necessarily, but they don‚Äôt care for us at all. You‚Äôll be fine in Moscow. In the countryside not so much, they‚Äôll instantly spot you as an American, and they may mislead you re driving directions, supplies, etc.
America tries to make their lives harder and they know it.

        It‚Äôs fun to think of Blumpf as some kind of Forrest Gump figure tripping and falling upward at every turn.But I don‚Äôt think any of this is chance. During the Biden regime the Russians literally had no one to talk to. So they did their talking on the battlefield. The situation is far different today. I‚Äôll bet the back channels between Moscow and Washington are lit up like a Christmas tree.Both Trump and Putler are businessmen, they are realists and they want the same things. The rest of us ‚Äì Canada, the UK, Fwance, Germany et al ‚Äì haven‚Äôt caught up yet. We still languish with retarded leaders and old world globalist slobs and their old narratives. Most of us are going to have to be on board before anything useful can be accomplished. Carney, Macrone and Starmer will need to be shitcanned the same way Biden was‚Ä¶and that takes effort and time too.It‚Äôs a big machine, there‚Äôs a lot of momentum and moving parts and they will not turn on a dime. But for now they‚Äôre moving in the right direction. Credit where credit is due‚Ä¶

He knows where the skeletons are, who put them there and he dealt with them.He‚Äôs defied the global order and successfully waged war against it.

                        I can tell you from living here that it isn‚Äôt a particularly strong currency. Inflation is a problem here just as much if not more than in the US. People love to watch channels like the Duran and hear about how strong the Russian economy is. In reality, people here are feeling the squeeze. It doesn‚Äôt mean things are on the verge of collapse, just that the rosy pictures pro-Z commentators paint is a little silly at times.

                            Well that could well be a problem fellas.The Duran is one of the channels I watch simply because it seems they are right far more often than wrong. There‚Äôs any number of smaller voices that disagree as you do‚Ä¶ but I am not close enough to see if those voices have merit or not.Having said all that‚Ä¶ Things are horrible here too and are being papered over somewhat. The US is on the edge of collapse. China‚Äôs economy is predicated on a house of cards even flimsier than ours. I personally believe that at least a deep recession is in store for the US and possibly outright depression for its allies like Canada and Britain. But again‚Ä¶ my sources must be suspect too.My point is ‚Äì the accompishment of being third best in a class full of retards is a relative accomplishment.I really appreciate perspectives like yours though.

        Call me crazy, but I don‚Äôt understand why countries like Pakistan and India can have nukes, a little pipsqueak country of 8 million people with a nut job like Netanyahu running it can have nukes, but 90 million people backed by 2,700 years of civilization (Iran) can‚Äôt. The Iranians aren‚Äôt nut jobs. We‚Äôre just mad at them because they kicked out the Shah and won‚Äôt allow us to install their leaders anymore.

            While they have moved some, and have some elements of civil law, Iran is still based on sharia. It still supports organizations that would definitely use nukes if they had them.
I get that the cool kids are all in favor of Iran having nukes, but maybe stick with enrichment to reactor grade for the nonce? Make some kind of deal with both Russia and US that they will trade yellowcake or even reactor grade for medical grade? At least until we see what they do with their waste? If no dirty bombs go off, we can go from there?

                            Nonsense. You made the appeal to ‚Äúfairness‚Äù, another way of saying ‚Äúequity‚Äù.
I agree the US should stay out. Should have, definitely. Now, though? The Iranians have said many times they do not want weapons and are happy stopping at medical grade, or even reactor grade. Which seems to me to be a good way of avoiding the ‚ÄúSamson Option‚Äù that everyone is talking about.
So if Trump can play a part in ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù what Iran is already willing to do, and telling Israel to suck it up, bonus.

                            Because it is not in our national interest to push around Iran is the reason not to. Not because of anything to do with ‚Äúfair.‚Äù But the GAE operates mostly on imperial interest (aka greed) rather than national interest, which is why we have this Ukraine problem.

            True. Just remember this is an ideal setup for pulling out of NATO, something Trump wanted to do his first term even. So long as he can make the case that it‚Äôs the Euros who are the belligerents, and will likely draw us into a war we don‚Äôt want or can afford, he has the setup to back out completely.

                I think pulling out of NATO is a bunch of hopium on some people‚Äôs parts. I don‚Äôt see that ever happening. I do think Trump is leveraging the threat of pulling out of NATO to get what he wants, however.

                    Absolutely. It will be hopium until it happens. Kinda like some people thought USSR was on the verge of collapse, and others scoffed, insisting state socialism was the way of the future. Until it did collapse, and everyone who was mistaken immediately switched teams, saying they were always on team collapse‚Ä¶

            To answer the question, I think the Euridiots would behave very differently if the US were not in NATO. As it stands, they can antagonize Russia at will knowing their big brother will come to the rescue. If the US pulled out of NATO of course, NATO itself would fall apart in a week.Of course, I sometimes think the Euro-yappers keep the war going just to draw attention away from their horrible mismanagement of their own countries with respect to immigration, energy, restrictions on free speech, etc‚Ä¶ Imagine if a piece of shit like ‚ÄúSir‚Äù Starmer couldn‚Äôt fear monger about a Russian invasion.

        I have cut Trump a lot of slack with Ukraine because last time a president was clearly going to defy the CIA, the rest of the MIC and Israel, he, JFK, was killed.

Trump was impeached twice because he wasn‚Äôt as enthusiastic as demanded by the Jews and the rest of the blob about wars with Ukraine, Russia and Syria.

        I was reading Simplicius a few minutes ago and he said that the Ukraine is recruiting kid drone operators from the USSA now. The article he referenced named a 20-year-old who is there now. My hope is that after the war ends the FSB, GRU whatever, gets their names and addresses and visits them in a permanent way.

        I don‚Äôt think the war can end, because too many people depend on the grift. The Europeans are forming up a giant grift fund under Van Der Leyen to ‚Äúre-arm‚Äù i.e. create a giant Euro slush fund. War justifies the ‚Äútotal fix‚Äù to the White problem by a giant draft to send all White men to die on the Russian Front. That was the deal the ‚Äúwhite powdered‚Äù up Starmer, Macron, and Merz were dealing with on the Zelensky Train. They were openly doing lines in front of the press.Moreover, the neo-cons will not allow any end to the War. The next phase will be the Europeans sending most of their White male population to die there, and after that the mandatory sending of the US White male population. ‚ÄúFun fact‚Äù is that Ukraine is drafting men up to 60 to send to the front in what amounts to a death sentence.While the US Military Industrial Complex wants to end both Yemen and Ukraine to focus on China (the Indian / Pakistani war showed that the French Rafael jets were second rate while the Russian SS 400 anti air missiles were good and the Chinese jets were also pretty good) ‚Äî the intel agencies won‚Äôt allow that and are still very powerful if not totally supreme. Fat Victoria Nudelman is still waddling out there as the fat lady yet to sing, and has real power as USAID was not her only stash of cash.Maybe I am too pessimistic (a shock I know) but it sure seems like the Euros and Zelensky and Trump act as if the latter is subservient to the group of the former. Maybe they are all just Hunter Biden-ed up delusional weirdos. That is possible.

This is also why Western governments and corporations are allowing a minor pause on the march of the Woke/DIE nonsense. They know full well that their performative rollbacks will get Whites to sign up for the military en masse.

        Let me add, Zelensky has just turned up in Instanbul, demanding Putin personally attend, saying he will never give up any territory including Crimea, and posturing.The problem is that Zelensky is the hero figure to the press and the deep/derp state. The FT columnist Jemima Kelly wrote an editorial blasting Trump and Vance for disrespecting her hero like an enraged 12 year old girl defending the boy band BTS. Zelensky sure seems like HE not Trump (or Putin) is in control, and in a sense Zelensky is in control, not them. Unless or until the tanks roll into Keeeevvvvv then Zelensky will continue to strut around, Hunter Biden-ed up, for the foreseable future and there are always European men and eventually American men to feed into the meatgrinder of the Russian Front.

Correct.
Unfortunately, Putin can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt understand this fact.
Without Zelensky, the entire Western propaganda narrative collapses overnight.

        I‚Äôm hoping this means the end of the EU. It is a lethally ridiculous concept; imagine 44 US states that don‚Äôt speak each other‚Äôs languages, that used to raid each other.
We have Magic Dirt, I think they tried Magic Money in the EU. As if a shared currency were a water thicker than blood. The EU has no President, no King, only a hostile, unelected Parliament. And they can‚Äôt even defend themselves, not only from their Parliament, but from the outside invaders it brings in.
The Pax Americana has failed to defend its ancestral people, quite the opposite.

        The meeting is remarkable in that Putin forced their move.  They reacted to the QB‚Äôs arm fake, bit on the receiver, then tried to recover by dropping back too fast and losing their balance.  Slot Receiver gets a huge catch after 3rd and 20.   Putin, like Brady, is moving in for the juggler.

        The Europeans seem to be delighting in flexing their military muscle for the first time in generations. They have a ‚Äúnoble war‚Äù they think they can win and how dare Washington intrude on a winning formula. The problem is the Russians keep crunching the Ukrainians down to size. No one anticipated that the arrival of mass modern weapons wouldn‚Äôt do the trick, but they have only bought Ukraine a little more time. The Europeans, in thrall to their American master, will take the inevitable capitulation like good little bitches. This will teach them not to meddle where their master fears to tread.‚Äî Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
