        A lot of Facebook hate recently. Seems many to see it fail or predict its failure. The market cap is justified by revenue and profit margins, the former which is growing at 50% a year and the later which is higher than almost any company in the S&amp;P 500.  Of Facebookâ€™s one billion users, six hundred million return on a weekly basis. They have been calling facebook a bubble since 2007. At some point they will have to admit being wrong. Stubbornly coveting wrong beliefs in the face of contradicting evidence impedes understanding. Facebook is a great success story and one that is far from being over.
