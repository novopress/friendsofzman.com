        I appreciate Derb‚Äôs commentary but find David Irving‚Äôs and Darryl Cooper‚Äôs takes on Churchill more compelling.  But I will say in the old Bulldog‚Äôs defense, FDR was worse.

            At the time Derb became acquainted with the subject,‚ÄúChurchill did WWII‚Äù was uncontroversial conventional wisdom among British historians‚Äînot the Marxoid ones, who were just beginning to say the Allies let Hitler do a Shoah becausewhiteness, but the old traditional ‚Äúcourt‚Äù type historians who died knighted. It‚Äôs in their books, not Irving‚Äôs (also uncontroversial, we should remember), that Cooper found the story.

Derb has chucked all that to submit to the authority of Bari Weiss, for whatever reason. Conservatism, I guess it‚Äôs called, since every conservative has done the same.

                Yeah, Churchill was so much in debt to the Joooooz that he enforced the policy of not allowing any of them into Palestine throughout the war.
Unlike some, though, I don‚Äôt let a few blemishes diminish my image of the man.

                    There‚Äôs too many members of the Heinrich Himmler Fan Club who dislike Winnie because he won his war, preferring to believe that Mustache Guy was a nice man who was misunderstood, instead of a weird spaz with the emotional continence of a toddler who would have sterilized them as ‚Äúracially undesirable‚Äù had he won his war.
Churchill was not responsible for contemporary Clown World, which is what they really want to indict him for. That can be laid at the feet of their idol Adolf, for igniting the war that put the Clowns in the global driver‚Äôs seat.

                        While Churchill did not singlehandedly lay the foundation for contemporary Clown World, he most certainly played a significant role.  His role is clearly substantial enough that it does in fact warrant investigation, analysis, and articulation.  This is important because we need as thorough an understanding of just how the hell we got here as our own foundation for moving beyond.It‚Äôs not enough to note spoiled children of privileged, coddled and sheltered to a historically unprecedented extreme, erupted in unhinged rage because of their spiteful mutantness (no amount of money/privilege can fix this), and then those in power let them loose and gave them absolute free reign.  The foundation upon which this recent part rests, as well as some building out on top of this foundation (err ‚Ä¶ progress) had to first be in place, and Churchill (as well as others) played a major role in laying this foundation.

        Two peoples separated by a kinda-sorta common language Dept:Derb must be forgiven for his mispronunciation of ‚ÄúAmish.‚Äù But after all, he hails from an ostensibly English-speaking nation where they pronounce the alphabet‚Äôs first and last letters, respectively, ‚Äúaye‚Äù and ‚Äúzed‚Äù. If the Limeys stumble with the very letters how would they do differently with words?Besides, why should non-Amish be especially charitable to odd religious separatists who call everybody else ‚ÄúThe English‚Äù? Granted the plain folk don‚Äôt seem to cause any trouble, but can you really trust people who have both a Blue Balls and an Intercourse in one of their most populated regions?I‚Äôm no linguist, but it‚Äôs likely a simple issue of linguistic drift. After all, here in the Colonies we‚Äôre well into our fifth century of living at distance from the Motherland (Mumland?). Is it any surprise then, that distinct dialects would develop? Right-o, Guv!In conclusion, a joke in slightly poor taste:Q: Why do American‚Äôs use the term ‚Äúline‚Äù in preference to the British preference for ‚ÄúQueue?‚ÄùA: Because f‚Äî queue, that‚Äôs why.

        My father warned me against Churchill worshippers.  ‚ÄúBut‚Äù, said he, ‚Äúin 1940 he was the man for the hour‚Äù. He also said that it was before his time but that Churchill‚Äôs decision to move the Royal Navy from coal-burning to oil-burning was spot on.

        The bust was a gift to Lyndon Johnson, then President, following Churchill‚Äôs death in 1965. It sat happily in the Oval Office for 44 years until Barack Obama replaced it with one of Martin Luther King.Trump, who is a major Churchill fan, restored it in 2017 but then Joe Biden removed it again in 2021, ‚Ä¶Come January the old bulldog will be back in the Oval Office.doesn‚Äôt this type of schizophrenia prove the need for a deep state? Why does every one who rules need to be elected? As Mr man likes to ask, ‚Äúsays who?‚Äù It seems natural to governance that a deep state evolve to make up for the weakness of democracy or a republic or whatever America is. A country needs consistency and stability in rule.I wouldn‚Äôt mind a deep state if it was for the prosperity white people and their future. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something
