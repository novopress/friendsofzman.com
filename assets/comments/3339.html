        Facebook and Twitter are worth millions because people believe that after a few more years they’ll be worth billions.grey:  Facebook sucks as an advertising platform for small businesses.  Facebook is set up such that they’ll only serve ads to a random and limited selection of a business’s followers.  To get it served to all of them, you have to pay quite a lot–as in, multiple orders of magnitude more than the “standard” fee.  To get it served to everyone on Facebook, you’re getting into five or six figures–that is, a large company’s ad campaign size of budget.Which is what Facebook needs to keep the lights on.  They aren’t going to be supported by Grandma’s Homemade Jelly who buys a twenty-dollar ad once a month, they need Volvo to spend a hundred k every week to get a Volvo ad in front of everyone on Facebook for a day.And you’re right about it being “mindshare”, not specific products.  The point of traditional advertising, these days, is not to convince customers to switch to your product; it’s to convince current users to stay with you.  To tell Volvo drivers that their next car should definitely be a Volvo too, to tell Bud drinkers that they’re making the right choice of beer.  New product discovery happens via friend networks, which is why advertisers are starting to bribe fashion and “lifestyle” bloggers.

        I worked for a time in advertising and I know that as it is an ‘industry’ it has to produce something. In this case the product is eye-candy (or irritating eye-sores depending on which way you look at them.)As a well-paid industry remarkably free of actual sweaty work it has to keep promoting itself to keep the checks coming in. But the one thing that makes all TV advertising pointless is the number of people who can recall an ad’s ‘storyline’ or its music and even its characters, but have very little recall of the product spending all that money to make it happen.As I worked in newspaper advertising, we didn’t have the music and the movement but we jumped through hoops to tell potential advertisers that for every copy of the paper purchased there were three readers, which we couldn’t prove though we had lots of data to seemingly back up the claim.

        I wonder that myself. If the ads cannot produce a positive ROI, who buys them or who would be left to buy them after everyone has been burned? But there are a lot of small business – thousands of new businesses created every year – and probably many them advertise on Facebook. There is an inexhaustible supply of new advertisers.  Then you have the big advertisers like GM, Ford, and movie Studios. Unlike smaller advertisers, they are more interested interested in generating ‘mindshare’ than a positive ROI. They just want to raise brand awareness for their latest soda, car or movie rather than turn a quantifiable profit from the ads. These big advertisers have so much money that the Facebook budget is still small relative to other media.

        I have a Bachelors of Business Administration and the statistical models and analyses used in our accounting, economic and production classes were markedly missing from marketing classes.  Virtually no quantitative applications were taught or applied to advertising strategies.  I suspect much more than 50% of all advertising budgeting is wasted.  I too also wonder why companies like ADM, TRW etc., that have no exchange with the general public, advertise.
