        Related, I think:Recently, my wife needed to get Skype up &amp; running so she could do a live interview.    A couple of our friends (oddly, ones who had displayed the symptoms above, and now have Ukrainian friends)piped up to tell her how easy and wonderful Skype was, they’ve been using it for years, yata yata.Well, in the event, installation was not a snap, and days before the crucial event, she called the expert Skype users to try to set up a test session, and guess what; due to one reason or another, no one actually had Skype up&amp;running on their computers.   Oops.Lying liars who lie like rugs.

        Piety bracelets?They’re called bumper stickers.ALSO “for sale” at about $1.00-$5.00 dollars.They’re letters to the editor, usually AFTERthe main event, demanding other peoples time and money. They’re the “protest” posters on a stick, found dumped on the ground at the first sign of rain, waiting for “someone else” to responsibly dispose of them.*sigh* I shoulda’ gone into the “one off”, novelty printing business.
