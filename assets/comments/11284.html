                Plus nihilistic identity politics is simply exhausting for the participants.  Just grazing through the constant Facebook postings of the Progs around here (and these are middle aged supposedly “mature” ones) one surmises their political metabolism has to run at the intensity of a shrew to keep up with the factions, various right wing plots, the 32 sexes plus micro-segmented minorities–each of whom has a bill of particular micro aggressions that must be salved.

            I’d caution against this line of thinking as it is intrinsically messianic. The left has been in the business of deconstruction for centuries. They’ve pillaged, plundered, and destroyed quite reliably for long enough that hoping “this is it,” does not a rational statement make.The left has been engaged in limited acts of auto-cannibalism. We’ve seen a handful of dutiful Brahman academics fall on the sword of diversity and inclusion. But for all the pomp and ceremony surrounding these ritual acts of sacrifice, their number is still undeniably trivial.It should not stretch the imagination as to why hoards of white liberals count themselves among this elect. Most of them will gain from their position as traitors and righteous bigots.

                Every political movement has within it the seeds of its own destruction. There isn’t a perfect one. All are limited by the scope of their time and circumstances and when things change they are set up to adapt in ways which aren’t in keeping with their preservation. Sure, deconstruction will work for a while. Even a long while. Eventually it will bring itself to an end. Look at Stalinism and Maoism. Both were heavily infested with deconstruction. Does either exist today?

                    Mao is still revered in China. There are still monuments to Stalin proudly standing. The abject worship is missing, and that is a good sign.

                        When you say “abject worship is missing” are you speaking of Stalin?  Both have been entombed/enshrined.  But China certainly seems to have a much greater “reverence” for their murderous leader (of his own people).

        The leftists believe if they have no past then they cannot be held accountable for their failures. If the future is irrelevant then they are not burdened with any expectations and thus are free from judgment. They exist in a perpetual “now” in which their immediate emotions and desires are the only reality. This is why their rage is overwrought and petulant like a child sent to bed without dessert.It is the reason leftists are so vehemently anti-religious. If there is no heaven and no hell then there is no sin or need for redemption. This is why all their causes are utopian and their only “morality” is that the ends justify any means.

        Nowhere do I see any specific discussion of why we should save our history for the future, and I think it is important to have a “why”.  I’ll start by saying that the American Republic is the most complete and comprehensive governmental experiment in acknowledging that the exercise of our freedoms is the exercise of our human rights, and not as permissions granted from our “betters”.  We are free to exercise our rights, and we are given the responsibility to exercise them appropriately and well.The dirt people have rights as human beings, and it is not the appropriate role of government or our neighbors to abrogate those rights.  So many are so busy turning to the government for guidance or exercising our own rights to take away the rights of others, this fundamental element of the American Experiment gets obscured and endangered.With the exercise of our rights comes the responsibility to demonstrate that the average person is actually capable of doing so in a way that is constructive to our society.  We owe that to our fellow citizens, to humanity in general, and to our God.  The training wheels have been taken off, and we need to demonstrate that we can ride the bike.There are many, on all sides, through either their own greed or a skepticism about the essential goodness of mankind, who want to bind us in physical or mental chains.  The American Republic has thrown off those chains, and we need to constantly demonstrate that we are worthy of our freedoms and rights.  Do not let the perfect get in the way of the good, fulfill your role as best as you can and in your own way, and know that every positive contribution has value, even if it is small and unnoticed.

            I owe nothing to “humanity in general”. That said, I like your post and I think we’re on the same team. Still, I worry about your pleading tone.
You write
“With the exercise of our rights comes the responsibility to demonstrate that the average person is actually capable of doing so in a way that is constructive to our society.”
I’ll be happy to demonstrate this capability once the rulers demonstrate their fitness to govern our Empire. Until then, I feel no such obligation, and I intend to be free.

                Here’s the deal.  Our “betters” have always taken the position that the rest of us are ungovernable, and that their heavy hand in our lives is a necessary thing to make the world work.  Call it self-serving, or simply a negative view of mankind in general.  Our Founding Fathers said “not true”.  While they expressed some doubts that they, or we, could make it work, it turns out that America is the one real hope for mankind, because it is the only culture and system of governance that starts from a point of human rights, not permissions from those above us.  That, right there, makes us unique.  For all the positioning and framing that other cultures and systems make, it ALWAYS comes down to permission from the cloud people, not an unequivocal declaration of the God given rights of all men.  We are unique.With those rights come responsibilities, and we need to exercise them well.  The entire world watches us, and judges us every day.  Our cultural gift, handed down to us, is a fragile thing.  We need to nurture it, build on it, and show that men can govern themselves, and that in a pluralistic society which pulls people in different directions, we can find livable compromises.The problem is that the social contract has frayed.  Take care of yourself but look out for each other has been replaced with “screw you, I want mine”.  We have forgotten who we are supposed to be (not surprising, with the education, politics, and media we have been saddled with for a long time now).  “We” are now “triggered” by the acts and words of others, but give no room for others to think or act differently than what “we” demand.  That can’t go on.  It is acting like children, and plays exactly to those clouds that claim we can’t handle our own affairs.No doubt the clouds are aiding and abetting this straw man with support for open illegal immigration, diversity quotas, triggering, fluid gendering, and a dreadful education system.  We need to stand firmly against all of this and never flinch or back down.  But we also need to remember what we are fighting for.  It is not just to be right or to carve out a slice of the pie for ourselves where the space is safe for traditional values.  We, as an American culture, need to get ourselves back to some sort of reasonable consensus about our special place in the history of mankind, remember who we are aspiring to be, and why.  We can choose wisely for ourselves, and we can welcome those who share our vision for mankind.  If we get the big picture right, the rest of it takes care of itself.  People want to work for something that is bigger than themselves.  We have something special that just needs to be picked up again.  The cloud sabotage of this understanding, along with the multi-culti-equivalence cesspool that we have been marinating in, have dulled our senses. People yearn for what we have, and we are throwing it away.  Remember what we are fighting for, and that how we go about it matters.  Scorched earth is counterproductive. It is what the other side wants, even if they lose in the end.   We can still be completely resolute with a more measured and thoughtful approach.Win or lose, we need to document all of this permanently for the future.  If we fail, perhaps someone later on can pick up the torch for the common man, learn from us, and make it work. Our American Experiment has been one of the most fantastic episodes in the history of the human race.  It needs to be remembered, warts and all.

        One reason to keep our past memorialized is so we can understand who we are as well as from where we came.  It is interesting to me that the Confederate memorials say something about the 1920’s as well as the 1860’s, as so many of them were erected in the 1920’s.

            Seen purely as pieces of art, those memorials are beautiful and deserve preservation. Much as we admire the old monuments in Europe of whose history we know nothing, and yet admire them as objects of beauty, so will people in the future admire those old Civil War monuments. I hope. If not, maybe some fragments will remain to remind a future generation of the dangers of barbarism.

        The people tearing down Confederate statues are criminals, not benign protestors. And they are being openly permitted to do so by politicians, government officials, and law enforcement agencies. The truly insane part is that they think no one is noticing (or much cares that the rule of law is now obsolete). Why should any Southerner have any respect for the law from this point forward?

                It will be interesting to see how the Alabama senate primary turns out in September. One candidate represents the Mitch McConnell GOPe wing and the other (Judge Moore) is best known for defending the South’s traditions and culture. My guess is that most Southerners are deeply disgusted by the desecration of their heritage and will vote for the man who best fights on their behalf. Mitch is going to have to spend a lot more money if he wants to buy this race.

            I read this, as well. It has appeared in several different stories independent of one another. Something is afoot. Also don’t forget that the DoJ is looking into this. If it turns out that the demonstrators were bussed in at the last minute, there could be some prosecutions farther up the food chain. If it can be proved that the leftist were the inciting element, those are grounds for lawsuits against the city and state officials. Stand by.

        When you “forget” history, it’s easier to ignore the 100,000,000 dead bodies piled up under Marxism so that you can promote “Democratic Socialism” as the version of Marxism they promise will get things right this time.  And run around calling your little band of violent extremists “Antifa”, while pretending nobody is going to remember who the “AntiFascists” were throughout the 20th century (hint: MARXISTS!).

        This brings to mind something I read a few years back, when some sort of “national association of librarians” (I forget the exact name) announced a new policy on accepting used book donations.  Specifically, anything published prior to 1973 (or 1974) was to be tossed in the trash, because the paper they were printed on contained some acid compound which supposedly had some deleterious effects.I knew the acid thing was merely a pretext for another means of culling the bookshelves of any history that told of how things really went down in the past.  Much like the Khmer Rouge’s “Year Zero,”  where all previous history is irrelevant.Mustn’t let the plebes discover anything contrary to The Narrative!

            No, there really was something to the high Acid paper thing. The bigger story was why books were printed on paper to begin with when Hemp was a far superior medium, and we had the whole “Marijuana” crazed Negro fabrication to protect the forest holdings of Hearst and descendants.

        SJW’s, who didn’t give a hoot in the world about racist statues during 8 years of Obama, are just trying their best to claim the moral high ground and using it to justify their criminal actions.   Yesterday a group of people are discussing that all statues of Christopher Columbus need to be torn down because he was an evil man who brought death and misery to the New World.  These SJWs claiming if they were alive in 1492 they would be out there doing every thing they could to stop him from setting sail.  The typical SJW my morality is better than yours gig.Except its ridiculous banter.   I asked them what did they think the morality of a person living in the year 2525 would have.   There were guesses made by today’s standards,  but I said nobody has any idea what the world will be like in 2525.  So all you can do is guess.   So I asked them to explain how in 1492 they would using  SJW moral principles  from the year 2017 to thwart Columbus’s plans.   The answer is they wouldn’t have.   They would have most likely cheered Columbus as a hero for his work because their mind set would not be of a SJW from 2017.    The concept confused them and they insisted their mindset and morality would be the same as today.  Hogwash.Also telling them that Columbus did not come to the new world with the intention of bringing death, disease and misery to the inhabitants here got me dagger stares and banter that I did not know what I was talking about.   They are generation completely lost at this point.  Stalin would be very happy if he was alive right now.   Those great useful idiots

            A Chinese graduate school history teacher taught me to “always go to the first person sources of the time”, if you want to understand the issues of the past, and the broader context of those days.  Relearning history using this discipline makes clear how much history is twisted to satisfy the arguments of today.

Don’t be too certain.  I’m sure that as it suits their purpose, the elite will have us venerating their version of the past, however fictitious or slanted it is.  And it won’t be entirely fictitious.  They are very good at stitching together bits and pieces of the truth, even fairly large pieces.

So long as there are White Males and so long as there is no serious pushback, most particularly to its cashflow, the Prog religion will *never* run out of devils.Did the witch finders run out of witches during the Middle Ages_?  Are the witch doctors in Africa and the Caribbean in any danger of going out of business today_?Why_?  There’s money in it for the witch finders and witch doctors and no shortage of fools living in spiritual darkness.  At every Prog outrage moral people have said, “Surely they’ve gone too far this time.  Surely people will rise up and oppose this obvious moral evil.”  But no.I don’t know where it goes from desecration of graves, but it’ll go somewhere.  Pushback is the key.

                    Germans have always excelled at “following orders”.  In this instance, I say it as an explanation, rather than as the usual indictment.

                I was going to add some amplifying information to my Nietzsche quote but I thought my meaning would be clear enough. Obviously I was wrong.Psychologically the left is constantly battling invented “monsters” even though the “monsters” are banal, historical, or even imaginary. Look at what it has done to them.As for the abyss part, if you can’t figure it out, I can’t help you.

                Quite right.The average German soldier fought for the same reason the average American soldier did: It was his duty. And, as the war pressed into its final months, he was fighting to defend a doomed homeland and its people. There is no other way to account for the heroic and tenacious efforts of the Wehrmacht on the crumbling eastern Front in 1945. Fanaticism had little to do with it.Anyway, that’s the perspective of my father and father-in-law, who both served in that war. Both of them went toe-to-toe with the Enemy, and once in awhile killed enemy personnel ruthlessly. They didn’t look into abysses or worry that they might become monsters. Or of they did, their worries were unfounded. They went on to live gentle, respectable lives, raising families, paying their taxes and saluting the flag.That is, precisely the kind of men now called “the deplorables” by aspiring national leaders.Anyway, I think it was Beowulf who actually fought literal monsters, and who fought and slew Grendel in an abyss, under the sea. Where does he stack up? Did he become a monster? Or was Beowulf just a stand-up guy in a “difficult” age?

        Good point. These people are criminals but then again this crap has been going on for a while. When that brain dead Baltimore mayor said people need room to destroy it was obvious there is no more law and order. At least not in the black areas.Much like the no-go zones in Europe infested with radical muslims now we have areas in the US where law &amp; order does not exist.We only have ourselves to blame or at least the ones that voted for obama. When the president of the United States came out to defend every street thug that got shot down ( and rightly so ) it became obvious the country was headed in a bad direction.My liberal friends tell me why you keep talking about obama ?  He’s not the president anymore !  Oh, but his is legacy still lives on. The black criminals and their white sympathizers are out on the streets blatantly destroying public property. Yet the authorities stand by and do nothing.When will white America or what’s left of it ever wake up ?sorry for the rant.

            Part of the utter rejection of anything Trump by the left is a rear guard action to protect and extend Obama’s “legacy”.  Even they know that what has been going on is way out of bounds.  Any orderly and comprehensive clean-up of all of this is going to make for some big changes, which they don’t want.It tells you something about the lack of long term thinking in a lot of people’s heads.  Obama’s legacy quickly leads to a third world existence for most of us.  The impulsive people and short-term thinkers out there have really been duped by a bunch of trendy lies.

                Obozo’s (**spit**) legacy has already been sent to the round file.  I find it interesting that just when a confluence of success in GDP growth, foreign intrigues, NAFTA negotiations, etc. are showing fruits, that the Left has started this massive campaign to distract from Pres. Trump’s accomplishments.
This is all by design by a fearful and panicked global elite, and people like Soros and Hillary who want to stop criminal investigations from proceeding into Dem misdeeds.  It is all Kabuki with a deadly intent.

        The British and their American offspring were meticulous records keepers. The Portuguese were atrocious, and the Arabs even worse. The history of slavery has consequently focused on the American experience, though the slave trade to the American colonies pales in comparison to the Arabian and Brazilian volumes, or that even of the Caribbean. Dead men tell no tales, and when, as in the Arab world, the males are relieved of their testicles, we find neither documents nor descendents in which grievances can fester.The paucity of records, and in the Arab case, paucity of offspring, has perverted the historical record of slavery. In Brazil, poverty has ensured funding for historical sites to be inadequate, and the termites and rains have rendered almost all of the slave markets to dust. Apparently for the better, for all concerned.

        &gt;&gt; The Left organized a great PR campaign in response to Charlottesville, but they threw it all away in an orgy of violence over the last week.
I don’t watch television so maybe I missed something, but everything I have seen in the MSM on the Internet or on the radio described innocent, peaceful protesters being attacked by violent neo-Nazi extremists. Did I miss something? Did one news outlet even come close to telling the truth?

                Yeah, but… where do they go? The internet? It’s true that we can still talk here, but anything to the right of George Will is being squeezed into a “non-paypal” fringe and, as Z blogger likes to say, it won’t end well.The revolutionary colonists had ‘committees of correspondence’. My guess is that the Postal Service will soon be authorized to open mail to investigate “hate” purveyed by dangerous hate groups within the USA, under some Homeland Security edict intended to keep us “safe”.Who knew that “safety” would be the inarguable mandate preventing any two people from sharing their thoughts?I’m just pointing out that we are deeper trouble than we think. Any normal person can see where this is all going.

        The belief in erasing history and revolution has a old history. The english philosopher, John Gray has written about in his book “Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia”. Before “secularisation” the revolution was founded in the belief in the apocalypse where after the destruction there will be a just society. Many Christians sects had this belief. Gray traces the origins of the apocalypse to the testament and christianity. i think is it wrong.The evolutionary anthropologist, Robin Fox writes in his book “The tribal imagination-civilisation and the savage mind” that the origins of the belief in the apocalypse/revolution in rooted in human nature and tribalism. Civilisation is simply to hard to bear for many humans. They want to go back to the small tribal group where there was “egality, freedom and brotherhood. It will never succeed.

        Roman history is replete with attempts to destroy the images and monuments of leaders and factions who fell into disfavor. It was especially prevalent during the period of the empire. So attempting to destroy a history of which you disapprove is not new. Unfortunately, given modern technology, it is frighteningly possible to erase much of our heritage and to brainwash masses of young people so they do not love their ancestry nor understand it. A well known leader once lamented sincerely, “You cannot love that which you do not know, and you will not fight for that which you do not love.”

        Or maybe we just want to remove celebrations of hate bigotry and ignorance?
Why are you guys so keen on celebrating treasonous slavelord losers?
How can you people not realize that the vast majority of Americans are not on your side?
Read the twitter accounts of Marie Lu, Sabaa Tahir, Charles Clymer, Charles Blow
They all have children and love the country
The youth (you know the future) is not on your side:

            Nice try sport, but you have to make the affirmative argument. The default assumption of the mentally stable is we don’t erase the past. You have to make your case for the Soviet Option.
Since you cannot do that, the overwhelming majority of Americans assume you are dangerous un-American crazies.
Your cult is dying. We will replace you.

                I think Kevin is another avatar of Tiny Duck actually though at least his post is coherent if inaccurate
Also to add to what our host said, increasingly no one on any side believes on the multi cult anymore and this certainly includes non Whites . If you doubt otherwise go talk the Black folk who have been ethnically cleansed from California
Everyone other than the victims  seems fine with this, even the Feds made only a few token arrests
That’s one example and there are  thousands more which  not the sign of a health multicultural society

            Any child that runs the gauntlet of a liberal’s womb and lives to tell is a true survivor.  Campaigning for Bernie Sanders is the closest most of the women have ever come to being in a committed relationship with a man.
