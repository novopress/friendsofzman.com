        “Imagine if the Church of Scientology had infiltrated the government. Members got positions in the administrative state and the political system. They then directed money to organizations run by fellow cult members. Those organizations then used some of the money to lobby for more money from the system in the form of government contracts, but also by influence peddling to private actors. They would then organize these resources to control public policy.”
haha yea imagine if some religious group with extremely high in-group preference took control of our government and did all that that would really suck haha just imagine…

        Having experience with the Blob in my youth, it’s difficult to explain the level of ideological uniformity within the system. There were simply no alternative mindsets within it because the people allowed into the Blob were so stunningly similar in personality and outlook.They were the same person.Even the few flyover whites who managed to get into the Blob were the same. Indeed, they were the most loyal as they hated the local hillbillies of their childhood. Of course, this is their Achilles’ Heel. They can’t understand what is happening because our thoughts, our ideas never penetrate their world – and never will.

            Can attest. It goes a large way toward explaining why the Deep State has become so ossified and dysfunctional, too. The world outside of D.C./D.C. mindset changed dramatically but those within the sphere remained the same.

                Agreed. In my mind, a Venn Diagram of the drivers of the Deep State would consist of two overlapping circles:  the dirty money rackets and the broad policy consensus. It’s not just the uniparty…it’s a set of shared assumptions &amp; worldview (globalist, functionally progressive) of everyone who matters in all the institutions. Working-level flunkies in the bureaucracy never question it. It’s like a fish questioning the water in which they swim.I always think of Z’s point that it’s who, not how, that matters.  Imagine a Deep State populated by people who think like Pat Buchanan, and who see it as their patriotic duty to prevent President AOC from wrecking the country or President Tom Cotton from incinerating the world.

                    There was a seminal book written in 1968, THE CENTER, about how the imperial capitol worked. I read it about ten years back. Recommended. The operational model was brilliantly explained, and you see it employed almost identically today even though the world sort of changed over the last sixty years. “Bubble” doesn’t even come close to describing this situation. These people think they are fighting Lester Maddox and George Wallace.

It is wild that rather than describing a world in the distant past it comes across more as a contemporary user’s manual.

                                Stewart Alsop was a closet homosexual who was seduced by a KGB male agent once while the Soviets filmed the encounter. He was also the man who pushed LBJ into appointing the Warren Commission. At one time, he was one of the most influential journalists in the US.
As such, he was able to do something that most would never consider. Alsop turned around and went to his friends in the USGOV like Dulles and Wisner and admitted that the Soviets had homosexual blackmail on him, and was even more eager now to hup-hup-hup along to any instructions from Uncle.

                                    I don’t know if you read THE CENTER, but it oozes love and affection for the system to the point of religious reverence.

                                        Stewart. Joseph was not homosexual. He embarrassed himself during Vietnam (Joe) in Georgetown many times, however, and by the late 1970s, the Alsops — who just 15 years before had incredible power in DC — were just specters hanging around Pam Harriman’s salon.

                But I honestly don’t know how you’d ever change it. Even if you tried to overhaul it, the nature of the jobs would drive out anyone who thinks differently. The Blob can only be killed, not reformed. But the nature of DC would immediately set to recreate it.

                    This sounds crazy, but a Constantinople solution might–might–save it. Simply relocate the capitol to, say, Houston. I don’t think the GAE could be sustained as long as Byzantium, to be clear. That is sort of killing it.

                    There is a “Deep State” in every country. In fact, I think the term was originally meant to describe the govt of Turkey. However, the US deep state is unlike anything that has come before. It is sustained essentially by the US dollar. There has never been a international monetary system like the current one, where the reserve currency is pure fiat and there is an endless flow of dollars. The fall of the US dollar will kill the US Deep State as it currently exists.

            My grad school program in DC was a farm system for The Blob and it was definitely the flyover types most determined to ingratiate themselves with their fellow drones.  I discovered that a classmate of mine (of course he was a donut puncher) was from the same neck of upstate NY as me.  When I asked him about it he gave me a blank stare and looked like he wanted to bolt from the room in shame.  These are types that thrill at the idea of forcing the blessings of diversity into their former neighborhoods.

                The middle-class flyover types trying to get into the Blob were generally like the character Tracy Flick from the movie Election. Of course, there were a fair amount of wealthy flyover types who went to nice public high schools or private schools in the Midwest or Far West. They weren’t quite as pushy as the middle-class strivers as they felt a bit more at home with the East/West Coast elites, but they still retained their dislike of their fellow flyover whites.Regardless, the personality types were overall pretty similar. They had to be. Any normal person wouldn’t want to be around these people or have their jobs.

                    One of our most important questions is:  to what extent is the upper class whites’ hatred of flyover whites inborn versus how much is induced by the media.
I pray that most of it is induced because the alternative makes white solidarity nearly impossible.
Perhaps most of our ethnocentric alphas were slain in the wars of the last century and we’re left with self-interested detritus.  I sure hope not.

            This ideological uniformity mirrors precisely the ideologal uniformity of academia. That is hardly coincidental inasmuch as the Blob’s inmates all matriculated through the academy, and a high percentage of them through its elite nodes. This being the case, punishing academia severely will be a necessary component of any plan to vanquish the Blob.

            The blob is the game of Jewish geography, which is of course the game of “who do you know?”Laughs aside, it reminds me of the distinction in the Mafia about a “friend of ours” and a “friend of mine,” with “ours” being a “made” man and “mine” being an associate. The “made” men always help the other “made” men and you can’t kill a “made” man without approval of a boss. Associates can always be whacked with little warning and little approval from the bosses required.These people live next to each other in that hellscape of D.C. with their multi-million homes. They send their kids to the same tony prep schools (like Sidwell Friends). They all hang out together (kind of like that scene in Goodfellas where they talk about how the mob guys and their families hang out together with no civilians allowed, even on vacation). These D.C. types have no friends among the dirt people as they’d much rather catch the plague than associate with the “common folk.”They see themselves as a higher form of life than us out in the hinterlands. That’s why the whole bit about narratives seems strange to them, but inside their bubble in the Beltway, it makes perfect sense.

        The Deep Statedoesexist within the MIC and law enforcement, but it is a different entity than the Blob of shitlibs, strivers and busybodies that control the elite class.The analogy with Scientology is a good one — the elite class operates like a cult and to be a member of it you must adhere to its belief system, norms and attitudes. You do not get ahead an America by knowing or accomplishing things, you gat ahead by knowing the right people and having the right attitudes and joining this cult.This is the great divide that separates practical, average (Trump-voting) people from the elites. I came from a blue-collar background. My dad worked at the Ford plant for forty years. I mistakenly assumed that your value was going to be determined by what you produced. When I became professor, I took a workmanlike approach. I thought my job was to convey a discrete body of knowledge to students, and then test them to see of they retained it.Not so. My “job” was actually to join the cult of elites and adopt and disseminate their attitudes. Whether I was a competent instructor or not was essentially irrelevant. Naturally, I got tossed when I didn’t join the cult despite positive teaching and performance reviews and higher credentials than my peers.Long after the fact, I realized that the purpose of undergraduate “education” had not been to actually learn tangible things, but to learn how to interact with, and adopt the norms of the Blob. The purpose of undergraduate college was to do bong hits with the judge’s son, the congressman’s sons, and the police lieutenant’s daughter (never saw a bigger bag of dope in my life than the one in her hands) or to fuck the J.A.P. from Long Island whose dad owned some big company, and then capitalize on those connections when you graduated.Stupidly, I actually studied…

        The problem is that the deep state, as most people imagine it, does not exist. It is a useful fiction.Operative there is “imagine.” People intuit correctly, though. The Deep State is the only state. Elections and “public officials” are window dressing. Maybe there was a time when there was actual public input into government, but that is long passed. The Administrative State, probably the more accurate description, controls all aspects of government. It is why reform likely is impossible. People don’t want to turn over the applecart while they are warm and fed, but when the day comes that they are hungry and cold, can it be toppled? The Trump Administration dismantling USAID and deconstructing the system is Cloward-Piven and the proper pre-emptive response. Do they know that? It doesn’t matter. The black-robed thugs certainly understand it. The Blob only can be weakened at present.

            Why does Z Man have this persistent need to assert that the deep state doesn’t exist but “permanent Washington” and the Blob do?  It’s a distinction without a difference that he feels the need to protect.
My best guess as to his motivation is that, for him, the term “deep state” implies an active malevolence towards traditional whites while permanent Washington and the Blob just want “the preservation of their class.”
For some reason, Z Man wants to protect permanent Washington and the Blob from being seen as hating traditional whites.

                I noticed he qualified with “imagine it,” which is not quite the same as saying it doesn’t exist. The Deep States simultaneously does hate whites as a group and wants to protect its class, to be clear.

                The heart of  the Deep State is not penny ante outfits like USAID, it is the DoD and the myriad intelligence agencies. They are the product of the American Empire that developed during and after WWII. I have not seen that Trump is inclined to cut back any of that stuff, except DEI (he wants to throw another $150 billion at the DoD). He has failed to negotiate an end to the disastrous Ukraine War and has escalated our military commitment to Israel. He wants to take Greenland by force, if necessary. I guess it’s no fun to be emperor without legions to play with.

                    None of us know for certain what is true. Logic dictates that they are all serving the same interests though each faction has its own motivation. There is no doubt that the fundamental goal of this new Carthage is to eradicate nations – particularly the nations whose history entails massive bloodshed in order to secure an ordered liberty and fight tyranny.This enables them to enact total replacism. Every sack of flash can be reallocated, redistributed and/or liquidated anywhere to squeeze more blood from the rocks. At the same time, all identity is erased and replaced with appetite for temporary dopamine hits that require getting satisfaction from renting a slightly fancier trinket or being pys-op’d into thinking it fancy because the mob values it too.At the same time, Mx. hypeh-to-hyphen-to-hyphen is a true believer who is also motivated like the Penny prosecutor by an intense hatred. She gets paid to destroy. Does she think or know what the ultimate aim is? Maybe. Maybe not. Does it matter to the deep state, which isn’t just the DoD and IAs, but also the corporate oligarchy that wants to squeeze in as many consumers as they can to keep growing the pie.Of course, the empire can only enforce this by military threat. If war becomes waged totally by digital cybernetic machines, than they can liquidate their founding populations without consequence provided they can import the people to design and build the next generation of machines.In short, the different things can all be true at the same time. There is a deep state and yet Mx. hyphen-hyphen can live to destroy on behalf of Leviathan fully convinced that she is spending her life destroying the source of Leviathan, and getting paid in cash and status to do so makes it possible to never be forced to check your belief.Of course, this project’s intertangled web of manipulation, ignorance, avarice, malevolence and greed in addition to being in violation of human nature, bends the gears to grinding in ever more incoherent directions creating ever great dissonance and creating ever more opportunities for scamming and predation that ultimately, means the system is a system of a system destroying itself.As for the population replacement enterprise, Trump can put a stop to it. He can radically tax remittances, tax and destroy businesses who support it and remove all of the money from the endless labyrinth of Mx. hyphen-hyphens. Of course, that labyrinth has control nodes. Mr. Mayorkas the first Latino who is not a Latino – another avatar of incoherence and totally transparent lies that this hopelessly corrupt system is founded upon, being an obvious one who nobody has said a word about calling to account.

                    Except that the“the DoD and the myriad intelligence agencies“are precisely where we do want our tax dollars to go.We want better weapons than anyone else, so that no one will even dream of attacking us.And we want better intel &amp; communications than anyone else, so that we can know well ahead of time precisely who will be attacking us, and how successful their plans will eventually prove to be.What we don’t want are perfidious little would-be-Napoleonic parasites, ostensible brothers-in-arms, who secretly yearn to suck the blood right out of the nation.Having a powerful and honest and forthright military is GOOD for the nation.Having a powerful and honestand forthrightIntel community is GOOD for the nation.The emphasis there, of course, is on the HONESTY &amp; FORTHRIGHTNESS.Once dissemblance &amp; mendacity become the coin of the realm, our situation quickly deteriorates into the untenable.

                        “Once dissemblance &amp; mendacity become the coin of the realm, our situation quickly deteriorates into the untenable.”And such seems to describe our MIC.  Trump seems to confuse “increased budget” with increased “effectiveness”. When I see the progress wrt military prowess of our sworn adversaries who fund their militaries on funding that amounts to a small percentage of our current military budget, I can’t see where feeding the beast is the best place to start shoring up our declining military.Perhaps we need to take a lesson from private business here.  First replace the management, reorganize the business, then go out for a round of venture capital infusion.

                        “Except that the“the DoD and the myriad intelligence agencies“are precisely where we do want our tax dollars to go”It seems to me we have been shoveling our tax dollars to the MIC for decades without much to show for it.  No hypersonic missiles, aging and increasingly ineffective air defenses (See the Houthis strike on Ben Gurion Airport), grossly overpriced and vulnerable aircraft (F-35), but at least they have a panoply of diverse flag officers!  I would agree that we want our tax dollars going towards a strong military and defenses, but not while the current national security blob remains in place.  Nationalize the MIC, take away their insatiable desire for profit (and grift) and put real American engineers in charge to solve the actual problems the country faces.

                Because he is harmonizing this with managerialism and emergent behavior. I agree with an implication of the middle paragraph, but nowhere does the last paragraph appear in his works – he regularly writes about this animus.Z argues society is akin to a computer system. I disagree, but the distinction is not one without difference, particularly when written in the context of a larger belief system.

                Eh. That’s a bit harsh. Usually, when Z writes about the Blob, his primary concern is delineating its organizational structure and itsmodus operandi. But that does not mean it doesn’t espouse an ideology and work its wiles against whites. As the case of this Salem witch demonstrates, a key imperative of the Blob is to submerge whites in a sea of mud via open-borders initiatives. Z pointed that out. And, in other pieces, he has discussed the more general anti-white agenda.

                    “Deep State” and “The Blob” conjure up different associations for me. A deep state would be a highly structured and hierarchical andcovertthing existing within theovertstate. It might even have some of the same personnel playing drastically different roles in each. A file clerk in the overt state might be the director of an entire agency in the covert one.The Blob is something much different (and probably more sinister). It’s a hive mind that seems to coordinate its efforts without obvious hierarchy or chain of command relying on something that looks like telepathy. A deep state would also be vulnerable to something like the House Committee on Un-American Activities which was looking for a well-organized group of committed Communists ultimately getting their orders from Moscow. A Blob is much more like cancer. Miss one little part of it and the whole thing can regrow.I think the Blob is more descriptive and also conveys the idea that people both within and outside the government make it up. It activities seem to be organized loosely around what you might call the dark aspects of the feminine principle. So it is, in a rather protean way, deceptive, parasitic, subversive and traitorous towards what should be its native tribe, xenophillic, short sighted, and pleasure seeking.

This is how I took it too. Every time I see “Deep State” it involves some sort of obvious MAGA hat fan theory that always high personal/paranoid and misunderstands how the world works.

But what you just wrote makes a lot of sense too. It’s a self-organizing system with a lot of resilience, but not as much coordination as we often assume, despite the appearance of it if you follow the lying media.

                Because Zman is not a hu-ight nationalist and is, in his own way, a gatekeeper.A deep state / managerial state with hatred toward hu-ights is deserving of violence in response (destruction) and forcible expulsion of all its creatures and especially its  tens of millions of pets.  Probably 100MM total.  So downplaying that is helpful to gate-keeping.  Zman’s bipolar points for years have been: “All we need to do is regain freedom of association.” (manic) and then, “There is no fixing the system.” (depressive).The first is a cope &amp; the second is correct, but Zman shies away from the necessary implications if Europeans are to survive on this and the Euro-landmass.  We have tried to run white-normative countries with large minorities and/or majorities of non-whites.  They all end in failure and pretty quickly.  Time to run white-exclusive (or nearly so) countries as those have a track record for lasting quite a bit longer.HTH

                    Not sure where he ever said, “All we need is free association.” He talked about the death of free association as the cudgel we are beaten with, and he also discusses the only way forward is separation. But I don’t believe what you said is true, at all.

                        You have not been paying attention.  It has been a common theme of his.  I happen to agree that freedom of association is a Good Thing and that loss of it was a tragedy.  But regaining it won’t cure what ails us &amp; thinking it will is a cope to avoid needful Badthought.  Zman’s depressive take is, sadly, the more accurate.

                    That’s harsh.  Zman is not responsible for the problems he describes, and talk of violence is an easy-pass to the gulag.  Saying “there is no fixing the system” implies overthrowing the system.

                        You misspelled “a reasonable take, given his output over the years,” using the letters H A R S and H. Common error.  Where did I claim Zman is responsible for this mess?  I enjoy his writing, but that does not preclude reading it with a gimlet eye.  I enjoyed WF Buckley’s writing, too, especially the supercilious turns of phrase.  After he wrote his literary stab in the back WRT Buchanan &amp; Sobran, that did not keep me from reading his work carefully and making observations annoying to WFB’s fanbois.

                I took him to mean that deep state implies some group that operates under cover whereas he says it’s structural and at every level so not really separate and apart. Seems like a trivial difference but if you’re brain storming how to approach this issue, the deep state would mean rooting out a few bad actors. Fixing the permanent Washington problem means burning the entire thing to the ground.

                Back when “deep state” was a political-science term of art* I avoided using it because “state” carries the implication that it’s an institution—subject to reform, or not—not a list of names.The regime is just people who know each other and hate you,I know enough of them to know.(Yes, they pay each other with our money. It’s a given—theirright. It’s not a motivation. We are born in infinite debt to them, in every sense, they believe. Most of them believe itconsciously. Z’s wrong about this.)Now I avoid “deep state” because it’s a dipshit shibboleth. “Managerialism” and its variants are quickly succumbing to stupid use, too. The Thielbux have done their work.One of the bad guys’ greatest tricks—definitely their greatest trick onus—is sending us off on these faddish terminological goose chases, back and back and back again to an ever-shifting set of old books, in endless search of the true text**.They don’t read any books.Ask anybody who works in managerial-class houses.A friend in theveryhigh-end carpentry biz has a more extreme view: Our rulers not only don’t read, he says; they don’t doanything. No hobbies, no interests, no information.Celebs and politiciansborrow each other’s houses, the news often off-handedly mentions, as if that’s not incredibly weird. Because there’s nothing personal or individual in any of them. Where does all the money go? “Experiences”—utterly mundane ones, almost always.*Like “cultural Marxism,” you’re not allowed to remember that they came up with the term themselves.**The one thing I think can justly be called “Judeo-Christian” is our shared error/feeling that reality arises from words, that everything begins as something said (or read).

                “Why does Z Man have this persistent need to assert that the deep state doesn’t exist.”
It’s likely just a writer’s way of kickstarting a piece…a take…on a subject by presenting something to argue about.  In the case of the deep state, he presents a semantic. So he can either literalize or metaphorilize the term, in order to expound on how, “It’s not really that.  It’s this.”

            To me, Deep State is an excellent name for what is going on. It is deep as in it is permanent and is not affected by elections and seemingly impervious to changes in leadership.The one major vulnerability it has is the vast sums of money required to run it.  USAID was a good first step, but far more needs to be done in order to starve the beast.The whole deep state as a massive conspiracy with shadowy figures controlling the whole thing is what is the fiction.  In fact, it’s probably a media invention meant to discredit the whole concept.

                    Literally no Republican, even the holy Reagan, ever really tried to cut total federal spending. We were duped by those mendacious promises for 50 years. I feel so gullible.
From what I gather, Trump is increasing the total budget as well. Whatever he may be cutting with DOGE, he’s spending on the wars.
One might infer from our history that cutting the federal budget is as impossible as finding a married bachelor.

            It is important to understand the blind spots in the conscience of our domestic enemies but the time to indulge them has ended.It is true that from the point of view of a member of the deep state there is an alibi to the accusation, they are just working for NGOs that service the public. They can be charitable in name or facilitate international relations. But in reality they are ways to steal money from the state and give it to activists and people connected so they can live cushy lives doing things that are basically treason.The same happens with the white lies that we tell about race relations in America. The times of pretending we are all equal and therefore any difference in outcomes has to be explained by systemic racism has ended. And we can call people-of-N that name and even call their behavior N-behavior as decades of observations support the idea that they are incompatible with our civic values.Forced integration and cities that changed demographics to become third world sh*tholes demonstrate they cannot build anything and therefore we need to be governed by our people and if they want to share a political community they should be tolerated as second class citizens. What was done to Baltimore and Detroit was a crime against America, we deserve better. Same for California.N-behavior is N-behavior and the deep state is real and they hate honest hard working Americans. They celebrate the disappearance of the white race and everything they do is treason. Giving billions to the MIC and zelenski, importing the turd world in mass, entrapment of white crazy Americans, MK Ultraing, the drug war that is lost by design, pushing miscegenation, pushing abortion, porn and sexual degeneracy shown to toddlers… All Treason

            Deep State does exist but rather than a tiny cabal of people running things, it’s more about just the ingrained culture and way of doing things. The US government is like a sick corporation that can never turn itself around because of this inertia, unwillingness to change and inability to get rid of the people responsible for the cancer. It is self-perpetuating.

        The problem with these “rackets” is that they do real damage. It’s hard to believe that these people are just cynical money makers, when their activities have such monstrous consequences. It’s more likely that they are true believers. They just “know” that bringing in Somalis or Arabs into your neighborhood will make it a better and more vibrant place. The fact that they can make a lot money doing this is a bonus that confirms that they are right side of history.

            Right, and I think that’s probably why you see the mainstream sects so involved in it. Most sects had already been taken over before the Civil Rights Act and the Hart-Cellar Act. The faithful (and in some cases, their great-grandparents) had been indoctrinated via the pulpit, so it is only natural they entered  the (reverse) “crusade” filled with moral certainty.

                    How can you blame the malicious true believers? The arrogant “white” man refuses to abandon his obscenely evil civilization and the sophistries with which he defends it. How can he be stopped? How can something so complicated and resistant to correction be overcome?
It’s exhausting to work out a plan which preserves the perp, who defeats every attempt to love him. So the chosen solution, extinction, is accepted less for its merits than as a matter of mental economy and strategic simplicity.

Further, who would have ever known the “refugee resettlement” business was so massive.  I guess the old “invade the world, invite the world” was no freaking joke.

                        In a letter from William Burroughs to Allen Ginsberg c.1960 he found the lesser young writer’s faddish use of “human” as a noun a worrying sign of degeneracy—enjoy the irony—perhaps signaling a fading vocation, a loss of self to the times. Ginsberg never wrote anything interesting again (and joined NAMBLA).
Burroughs, an anthropologist by study and habit, a field now typically defined as “the study of humans,” the discipline in which you’re most likely to encounter “man (sic),” found it strikinglyoff. Even the OED, always keen to own the word-chuds, finds little earlier usage.
Telling tidbit, maybe.

                    For such folk, the highest good is immiserating their own people. As Noel Ignatiev so pithily put it, treason against the white race is a service to humanity. Ergo, inflicting harm upon whites is proof of one’s goodness. That is, needless to say, a deranged definition of the good. Among the mutants, spite is goodness.

                    It’s likely that those Irish Catholic are only culturally Catholic. As in Ireland herself, all that remains currently is only façade of the faith. The Jews successfully also remind the Irish of their less than kind treatment by the English/Church of England. They encourage them to hold a grudge/see themselves as perpetual victims, which is not difficult unfortunately in modern times.

        I don’t know how you stop this. There are so many of these people throughout every one of our institutions in the West now. It’s been occurring for decades, and schools have been churning out these types for at least two decades as well. It’s an entire priesthood and there are hundreds of thousands of them throughout our society.Let’s say we make NGOs and quangos illegal in the US tomorrow. Overnight, they’re all out of work. Do they sit at home for the rest of their lives? Obviously, they won’t. They’ll find other avenues to eat away at the nest.Most won’t like this fella’s name, but Hegel said wisdom is like the Owl of Minerva and takes flight only at dusk. People seem to have wisened up a lot over the last five years. But it’s night now. Very late in the day to have realized what has been done.

            It only gets solved one way, and most here won’t like it“What sense can we make of James Madison’s famous Federalist No. 10 today? This is his essay on the danger of divisive and controllingfactionsto government, and how the Constitution would guard against them. His solution was to eliminate the problem by encouraging factions and fragmenting them, so that none of them could abuse its influence and upend the system, and by structuring the scale of the republic so that no faction could have undue influence and deprive others of their rights.It’s not clear, from Madison’s point of view, just who the factions are in our world today. Are they the political parties? The beneficiaries of transfer payments? Is the military-industrial complex a single faction, or many? Likewise with the too-big-to-fail financial elites, or the health-care cartels, the endless political bureaucracies and rent-seekers — are they unified threats, or a multitude of self-interested parties? Or is the entire system simply overrun?What strikes us today is the overwhelmingenormityof our situation, the unpayable debt and unmeetable liabilities, the intentionally-blown asset bubbles, an economic system that can no longer create the organic credit it requires for growth, and the complete failure of politics to address the situation or even discuss it openly and honestly with the public.There was a shift not of degree but of kind, the Republic replaced by Empire, particularly after World War II. The “republican remedy” cherished by the Madison could not be maintained in the tide of History, the changes brought by a Lincoln, a Woodrow Wilson, or a Franklin Roosevelt; of new amendments to the Constitution; of innovations such as Keynesianism and unbacked debt-based currency.”https://deflationland.blogspot.com/2014/03/currency-collapse-is-agency-of-reform.html

                The factions seem to be the nomenklatura, which seems blithely unaware or disinterested that their world is going away, and the high stakes grifters looting at an ever-accelerating pace because they know it is not sustainable. There have been hints that the theft is unfathomable.

Either that or they will have to find ways to put food on the table and pay the mortgage, like everyone else. Mostly, the only ones who will find ways to eat away at the nest are the trust-fund babies.

                Ah, yes, they will start combing the “help wanted” sections of the local paper. They’ll just have to act normal, like everyone else.
This was the strategy conservatives employed with higher education after the 1980s. “Let ’em take basket weaving as a major. They’ll never get a job. Let the universities churn out useless homeless people with degrees in African feminism. Eventually they’ll just have to settle down and get a mortgage. No sweat.”
Worked out superbly, don’t you think?

                    Did OK until The Chimp made student loans easier to get. The basket weavers got jobs at drive thrus. Then Obongo both took over the whole thing, plus created “jobs” programs to pay the unemployable to do what their training prepared them for, which was mostly infiltrate and agitate.
That’s why stuff went to heck so fast in recent years. Obongo made sure the least competent and most ideological among us were the ones calling the shots.

                        Remember the trillion dollar Obama “stimulus?” I’ve read that this was added to the baseline budget and spent in every year since. Plus annual cost of living increases from the baseline.
Is it any surprise that they aren’t passing budgets anymore?

                            Absolutely correct.  The lack of a budget allows all these emergency expenditures to continue long after the emergency—ad infinitum.  People seem to think we need to deficit spend $2T per year, when in reality such was not the case before Obama and the Great Recession.  Most of the current “budget” is nothing but graft given to constituents—and yes, that includes Boomers and the like.  Compared to our current budget expenditures, USAID was an honest broker of their funds.

                                Just that ongoing stimulus is responsible for $15 trillion of our debt. Then add stupid wars and we might be down to about $15 trillion, which sounds downright quaint.

                        This began in the 1980s, when Obama was still in high school. Allan Bloom saw it at both Cornell in 1968 and was quick to recognize its recrudescence in the 1980s, which led to “The Closing of the American Mind.”It is important to understand that this isn’t about a poorly-designed bridge or municipal scandal that can be pinned on one person on a specific date. This has been civilizational. The Frankfurt School, it is said, academized politics.Conservatives, Sam Francis wrote, were the Stupid Party. You are surrounded by degeneracy and the rotting remains of a once-Christian land with strong families and beautiful cities. All of that is now gone, because the people have been propagandized and educated to believe it is normal and good to accept degeneracy, breakdown, and chaos. Do you understand what it takes to destroy an entire way of life? Do you honestly think signing a piece of paper giving out more student loans just 15 years ago caused all of that?

            Yes. It is why reform is likely impossible. Throwing a wrench into the system, which is what the Trump Administration is really doing, is the only viable option. They think it can save the system but it might help neuter it, which is the best-case scenario.

                Most of the economic objections to Trump I’m seeing amount to: “Well, this needed to happen but with a careful 10 year plan.” I’m old enough to realize that for big reform projects it’s “Rip the bandaid off as fast as possible and accept at least some extra damage along the way.” Otherwise it will never happen.

                    I’m still amazed his tariff plan worked as well as it did. Several promises, but the lack of signed treaties is a bit concerning.
Thing is, you build your economy around barriers and tariffs, you get a lot of businesses that will be non-viable in the absence of those barriers. So are those countries really willing to destroy all those in their countries, or are they playing for time, getting on Trump’s good side, hoping he changes his mind?

                        Who knows on both sides? I’ve also given up on Trump mind reading, other than to try to stop under estimating the man’s tenacity. He makes the correct people cry/go insane, so that’s as much as I’m going to understand of this until it’s over.I do know that if Trump implements tariff that amount to a protectionist scheme that exist at the end of his regime, it’s likely that they will stay. We’re clearly at the “fossilizing” stage of empire. Before WWII, we were changing the Constitution like it mattered. Now it’s under glass and walked by in hushed tones. If Trump changes something and it’s working, unless there’s a particular vendetta to be expressed through that topic, the empire will call it the new normal to be fossilized along with everything else.

            You don’t fix it any more than you could “fix” Constantinople in 1440 or the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires in 1914.
As Derbyshire so eloquently put it, “We Are Doomed.” It’s gonna get “fixed” by some unanticipated, exogenous event. Not reformed from within.
I actually hate to take that attitude, frankly it’s un-American. Americans were once practical, roll-up-your-sleeves and git-‘er-done people. But it’s a realistic attitude.
As the old saying goes, “It’s too late to fix anything, but too soon to shoot the bastards.”

            This is what late stage empire looks like, unfortunately. You can’t rely on the system to reform itself. It can only fail. The rate at which it fails is dependent on the circumstances of the empire. In the case of the United States, it has extremely defensible borders, no nearby enemies, no real global threat, and a magic money printing machine that can (literally) paper over problems. It can last a long time and likely will last a long time. But we are already starting to see the signs of fissure as the Romans did in the late 200s and into the 300s.

                I basically agree. However, whereas Rome still had another two centuries after the cracks began showing, I cannot imagine AINO will hold up another half century. The pace of destabilization is far more rapid in 2025 than it was in 325.

            You can’t stop this. The infestation is too comprehensive. You mentioned the institutions, and that’s the key. It’s not just the sorry vermin in DC, it’s their kindred spirits throughout the educational system, corporate business, the media, and Hollywood, not to mention cultural entities such as museums, libraries, symphonies, etc. It is impossible to root all these people out. If we assume we are stuck living in AINO with the Spiteful Mutants for the foreseeable future, about the best we can hope for is to get in a word edge-wise, which means inserting a sizeable number of our own people in the institutions. Even that, of course, will be extremely difficult because you would have to bring sufficient force to bear to compel intellectual diversification. Whence that force?

                Yes, it is everywhere. It won’t be gone until long after I’m gone. Might not be long, if they get all their wars. Perhaps debasing people for 80 and turning them into drug-addled slop junkies was necessary so that the Cloud People could dispose of us with as little guilt as possible. People used to be beautiful, it would have been very hard to pull off what they have been doing to us when every woman seemed to look like Doris Day and every man Cary Grant.

        A person’s opinion about the Khashoggi incident (which I feel pretty certain I still haven’t been told the whole truth about) is a very reliable baizuo litmus test. This one killing makes the entire Saudi regime and nation into evil personified (so goes the narrative). Denounced as such by the denizens of AINO, whose GAE has never killed anyone, and are thus entitled to judge. See this a lot among golf fans, references to LIV “blood money.”

        Deep State as a concept was introduced into Right Wing Thought by a guy called William S. Lind. He used Turkey as the defining example. The Turkish military inherited the spirit of Kemalism. For Muslim societies to function in the modern liberal world, the nilitary/government agencies have to ruthlessly enforce liberalism against the will of the people. Mustafa Kemal did a classic “Young” nationalist coup in 1919 and set the pattern. This means that every couple of decades, the military had to coup the newly elected extremist Muslim government.Ironically a few years after this popularization, the Turkish military failed to coup Erdogan and the government became more conservative Muslim. Obama didn’t like the optics of supporting a coup even though coups were an important part of Turkey’s political system. Thus Erdogan broke containment.It’s useful to look up Lind’s original lecture on the subject.

                As mentioned before I read your comment, Trump equates more money with effect. He will get poor returns with that thinking. He needs to clean house first in the military—and that starts at the Pentagon, not the trannies in the ranks.  That’s just a distraction for the rubes.

            There is something to what @Jeffrey Zoar says, but the lion’s share of it is the Ukraine War, and now, Yemen. The Bidet regime emptied the arsenals and it will take a decade or two plus a fortune to get them back to where they were.Ran into a guy who just finished one hitch in artillery, and he said they aren’t training with dummy rounds anymore. They don’t even have those. They just go through the motions, pretending to load and fire.Assuming anyone in MIC has half a clue, they’ve seen the effects of drones and hypersonics, for which we currently have no effective counter. It’s worth spending $100 MM in missiles to shoot down $100k in drones, because the alternative is a $ 10B flattop, assuming you can get the aircraft and munitions and men off before it sinks.Obviously, the answer from our point of view is to stop projecting power everywhere. Develop layered defense of just the US, including the continental version of Phalanx CIWS, and call it a day.

            Trump is a boomer who believes in that “peace through strength” malarkey. Even if that were true, our military is a paper tiger at this point that exists to procure weapons and make contractors rich. So Trump says “our military sucks how does it get better”, the Pentagon tells him that it can be done… if they get more money to buy more weapons. That is by the way the Pentagon’s answer to every question.

                    It’s not just that the MIC can’t deliver the hardware for a revitalized modernized US military. It’s that US military substantively isn’t American anymore, and absolutely does NOTHING to defend the actual American people. The army just cut 80,000 billets. Why? Because while some white boys came back, not enough did to even maintain the old level of force structure. The Marine Corps had already fixed their shortfall with force structure cuts some time ago.Modern militaries require even the lowest levels to have a minimum level of intelligence/capability to learn complex tasks/behaviors. Most 3rd-worlders who are capable aren’t willing to endure military life, and the rest are not only militarily useless but a net detriment. Stupid people around things that catch on fire or explode only ever ends badly. The GAE isn’t beating China, Russia, or Iran with 85 IQ cannon fodder.Moreover, NONE of them have any loyalty to ‘America’ nor should they. When, not if, they are put to the test, they will show zero fighting spirit. The US military is a mercenary force now. Sign up for the gibs and training that might lead to civilian-world money. Killing is one thing, but no one is willing to die for the vile thing that America has become.

                    It think we’ve crossed over the threshold whereupon the Blackberry Fruitcake Empire’s economic force is demonstrably more potent than its military force. This may have actually happened as early as the mid-90s.

            According to Mr. Anglin: “Trump was allowed to win the fake election because he is the perfect figure to reframe the American culture to make it into something that is maybe capable of doing a big war. It’s the biggest war budget in the history of any country. To what end? Where is the threat? America cannot be invaded and insofar as there are interests in the Western hemisphere, any of these countries can be bullied with psychological operations and special forces squads. Trump’s administration is doing a Hitler-style military buildup but Hitler actually had people trying to destroy his country. America’s only possible reason for doing this is offensive. Severely offensive.”

                    Regardless, there is a lesson here seemingly unlearned.  Hitler was a fanatic wrt his tanks.  He had to have the biggest and baddest.  The Russian’s had to have the cheapest and most reliable.  They built 50k T-34’s to Germany’s 8k Panzer IV’s. If we are on the road to war with a military buildup, it won’t be won with expensive, technical boondoggles.

                The current planning is for two major fronts, not 3 or 4. The only way to handle multiple is if they’re brush fires, not major hostilities with peer or near-peer adversaries. Those who have seen these plans know that even 2 fronts with significant threats is not going to happen. So $1T goes mainly to personnel costs, acquiring new systems, and maintaining (very poorly) our current inventory. Even a cursory audit was failed miserably, but hey not to worry, we’re defending democracy!

        Nothing changes until the environment changes. Systemic infection can only be cured by systemic remedy. Diagnosis is not remedy. You cannot talk or vote your way to a cure. You cannot indoctrinate or bribe a virus into submission. Laws do not eliminate crime. Ukrainian men are learning that you cannot win a war with a snazzy internet campaign. The United States was founded by men who were realists and bled in pursuit of that goal. Only tangible action can save us, and we must be smarter about it.

        “It is not a deep state so much as a broad state that overlays everything.”We’ve been over this terrain before. You seemingly have this fixation of deep state as an evil cabal whose members fiendishly rub their hands as they hatch some new diabolical scheme. But if I used terms like “blob” or “status quo” you would have no objection. People are invested in the status quo — their livelihoods and status depend on it. And they are invested in the status quo — dare I say the “deep state” — to different degrees. There’s an outer party and an inner party. As a collective it does possess a mind, a will, and a soul of its own, like one of those medieval golems, or an “egregore.” The US deep state egregore has a continuity going back to at least WW2, if not much earlier. Individuals, even groups, factions, and cliques come and go but the deep state as an organic entity remains alive and kicking. it is forever seeking conflict abroad, seeking hegemony. An Ungoliant.

                Yes, words do have meaning. For Deep State:“an alleged secret network of especially nonelected government officials and sometimes private entities (as in the financial services and defense industries) operating extralegally to influence and enact government policy” – Merriam-Webster“Deep state are potential, unauthorized and possibly even secret networks of power operating independently of a state’s political leadership in pursuit of their own agendas and goals. Although the term originated in Turkey, various nations have developed their own interpretations of the concept. In some contexts, “deep state” is used to refer to shadowy conspiracies, while in others it describes concerns about the enduring influence of military, intelligence, and bureaucratic institutions on democratic governance. In many cases, the perception of a deep state is shaped by historical events, political struggles, and the balance of power within government institutions.” – WikipediaThe term was adopted to try and describe how America’s government operates as far as policy decisions are concerned, because the description on the tin was obviously false. The shifting definition of “deep state” in the American context reflects the progression of initial ignorance to increasing clarity. The term did not set out to strictly define a conspiracy setup in order to discredit those seeking clarity a la CIA deflection tactics. Rather, the term was widely adopted as a placeholder where clarity could be accrued.Nitpicking normie use of “deep state”, as if it was a static and well defined concept, is a tiresome waste of words.That said, “status quo” is not a synonym for it. At least not a useful one. A rare miss from you, Arshad, but we all have our off moments.

        Unfortunately limiting the federal government to enumerated powers only not will get us to where we need to be. It will take more. It all looks like calculated opportunism to me. Hard to quell those types of mindsets. Choking off the money should help. Visible prosecutions appropriate to the obvious criminality will also. I like the idea of caning prior to any jail time followed up with one last cane strike before release. Can any of us really go Galt? I don’t think so. Well, maybe.

            Scientology’s methods and their extremely pervasive effects on the minds of its own cult members only truly begin to make sense when understood within the context of the non-redacted history of founder L. Ron Hubbard, including the Church’s primordial Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation connections to the intelligence community, and Hubbard’s own intelligence career. His role in under-discussed operations, on the behalf of US Naval and other intelligence agencies, include Hubbard’s work at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. in the 1930s –– the hot-bed of psychiatric research during Project Bluebird and Project Artichoke, the precursors to the infamous MK-ULTRA program –– in addition to his infiltration of Jack Parsons’ occult-influenced rocket program, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, whose work became the scientific foundation for NASA.https://unlimitedhangout.com/2025/04/investigative-series/scientology-the-cia-and-mk-ultra/By the way, the son of the founder of the Jet Propulsion Lab is married to Ghislaine Maxwell’s sister.

                Hubbard was a drug fiend and an Alistair Crowley fan, that’s pretty much it, all his BS stories about Asian mystics. Indian tribes, CIA, US navy record 1% true 99% BS
His scam made him rich, so in that regard he was a big success

                    How about those fellas at the JPL, though? Parsons and others. Then you have guys like Michael Aquino, a high-ranking Satanist, in charge of major propaganda programs for the US military for 20-some odd years.

                        In 2021, I bought my friend a copy of “Sex and rockets: The Occult World of Jack Parsons.”  She had been mentioning the subject for years, but no one else believed her.  When people in her office saw the book, they were gobsmacked.  Could not believe what she said was not ‘tin-foil hat’ nuttiness but based in fact.

                    Someone who, based on the parentheses in his name believes in secret cabals, is so ignorantly dismissive of those theories that do not fit into his narrative, should reflect on his arrogance. Yes, Hubbard was a druggy. He was also a lesser acolyte compared with someone like Parsons. That is what makes him a more visible member of the usually opaque.

        Excellent analysis. People, especially online, tend to forget the group patterns come from individuals working from individual motivations. The Blob is produced by upper middle class people from the globe doing their individual technocrat jobs. It is private club and the ordinary American is not in it. But it’s equally important to note that from their POV, the blob are the normies too. In fact they want to feel normal, particularly in our “democratic” world, which is why Kamala Harris is so cringe.Their collective effect in my mind is better thought of as the zombie horde effect, who are  quite destructive as a group because they all share the same goals. It’s not because the zombies are having endless evil planning meetings.

        It is not a deep state so much as a broad state that overlays everything. Every silo of power is controlled by people who believe the same things.
In other other words, Washington is a company town and they want America to build cars while the rest of us want high speed rail.

        You are absolutely correct – Trump is the SYMPTOM of the problem, not the cause of it.Hitler was a SYMPTOM of the problem, his ascent to power is a direct result of the conditions prior to his ascent. If the Weimar (biden) government had run things properly (e.g. just barely in favor of We The People), they would still be in power, and Cheeto Jesus would not have gotten as many votes as he did.Which also begs and begets the question – why did they let him win (this time)?I think anyone w/ 2 warm brain cells knows the 2020 election was at best a little fugazey, at worst outright stolen. So if they did it once, why didn’t they THIS time?They’ve already been caught (see Tina Peters), the evidence of at LEAST shennanigans, if not wholesale manipulation, is rampant. The unwillingness to even investigate most of the claims (dismissed through lawfare like Ms. Peters), is the tell. Remember the 2020 election when the supreme court wouldn’t even hear the case? That was a tell, too. They’re in on it. They’re compromised. 20 bucks says they’ve got video of that faggot Roberts p0rking some 8 year old boy. Just look at him, you can see the horns protruding from his forehead.

        Every government in the Western World operates a bureaucracy that is immune to change. They work steadily at pushing papers to present an image of industry. Perhaps 1 in 10 is really necessary, although they would have you think otherwise. The civil servant, hunkered down in his office or cubicle, moves with his peers like the cells in a jellyfish. And, like a jellyfish, he is spineless. The slightest hint of controversy makes him curdle up and die — he lives and dies by the public-relations sword — and he assiduously avoids career danger. It is a boring life being a bureaucrat and so she manufactures pointless drama. If she were to read this post on Zman she would tear out her hair and run for the lawyers.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
