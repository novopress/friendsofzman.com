        Always been a lack of humour/humor in the UK at the top. Ruling people has always, and will always be, a serious job not taken lightly.One of the reasons is that a lot of Brits were brought up to be polite no matter what (now they are brought up to fearful of consequences and others being ‘offended’) so when man called Henry Root (a fictitious character) who would write utterly stupid and weird letters — this was the age before tinterwebz so everything went snail mail — to the great and good then it brought nothing but politeness. The man known as Root then published the letters and the replies in a couple of books.All very jolly, and while he was inventive in his weird ideas the only one I can recall, (which is not a great example) was sending a five pound note to a top British upper-crust school with huge annual fees saying that he was sure his as yet unborn child child would be a boy and thus eligible for a school place, so this money should be enough to guarantee the lad’s admittance in a few years time. The reply was formal and carful and the money returned.But this was the whole point: no matter how obviously funny or strange or even downright rude the letters Root sent, the response was polite and proper and respectful. No one ever said “Go screw yourself, you lunatic.”That meant that anything a bit funny or odd had to be still treated with care and the easiest way to do that was to be officially serious all the time.Now as I say we are fearful of consequences and offence being taken, so the police — who haven’t the courage to jump on the nut cases who scream for the death of ordinary British people while staging ‘protests’ about UK intervention in some desert rathole — have something to do.Easier for the authorities to go after the mildly irritating than take on the shaggy bearded kiddy-abusers.

        Solzhenitsyn never tired of pointing out that the NKVD camp guards used the violent criminals to intimidate and help control the pasty-faced, soft-handed 58s (political prisoners).We raise suburban kids to be veal, as someone in the blogosphere just put it.  We raise urban kids to be thugs.  In another generation or two, if the suburbs get uppity, we release the urban thugs for a few days of rapine, larceny, and murder and the suburbanites get right back in line.Yeah, I know.  Wells covered this a while back.  But what I always thought H.G. missed was a gatekeeper class.  If natural selection was operating, the Eloi would select for less gracile and more robust, warrior-like characteristics.  So who keeps the Eloi the Eloi and the Mordocks the Mordocks?  Or to quote someone of whom Wells was a big fanboy, “Who, whom?”

        At all that, he’s better off in the UK.In the US, they’d have come at him with a SWAT team. You have to know that. (Because he’s known to have pointy pencils or some such…)
