        Gays wanted tolerance, then understanding, then acceptance, then special treatment, and now they want admiration.  What’s next?

            “In my grandfather’s time, homosexuality was a capital offense. When I was a young man you could get jail time for it. Now it’s accepted. I hope I die before they make it compulsory.”

        Modern liberalism uses homosexuals and homosexualism to help destroy the traditional watermarks of Western societies. Like Muslims, the more “extreme” homosexuals may be a minority but the remainder do not protest, do they?
It is the non-homosexual cheerleaders who are the most intolerant and who do the most damage. They are the ones who will ruin your life for a careless comment about gays.

        Hetero-men, imagine if you could go to a bar tonight and be just about sure to bang not one or two but three women cost-free and commitment-free. Sounds great, right! What a lifestyle! The thing is, you just have to keep this whole deal on the sly because people might consider it repugnant. Don’t go running around telling people about what you do and trying to get people to accept your lifestyle and you can carry on like this for years. Easy huh?

        I work for a big corporation. If I wear a shirt that “honors” the gay lifestyle, it is totally OK. If I wear a shirt mentioning the NRA or any Christian references, I will be sent home and it is grounds for termination (“I should have known better”). So who is the oppressed party these days?

        ESPN is a ratings whore, which is why they are obsessed with homosexuals.  I like to watch ESPN’s “Around the Horn” show every day, but each time they go PC and focus on homosexuals in sports, I know they will tow the liberal line.  How could they do otherwise with so many viewers and bystanders ready to take offense? The sad truth is they have nothing to add that hasn’t already been said (oftentimes better) by other people.  So, these days, when the topic on ATH leaves the playing field, I just switch the channel.  No sense wasting my time.

        Mr. C was a great eighth grade algebra teacher.  We all “knew” about him, or thought we did.  He and another man shared a house in our neighborhood that had the best lawn and gardens of anybody.  They lived quietly, we were taught to respect them and no speculative commentary was allowed.  Mr. C was just a little odd, that was all.  Like yourself, Z, I am wishing the gay “community” would just go back to being a little odd.

        1. Big difference between homosexual and “gay”. (ie) “…the guy was flaming, so it was obvious he preferred the company of men.” No, it was obvious that he opted for outrageous behavior to get attention. NOT a “condition” limited to “gay” folk.2. In my career peripheral to the “entertainment” industry (everything except “the talent”, and makeup), most of the behavior by “flaming” gay folk is considered “hostile workplace, sexual harassment”. Sure there a LOT of skilled, artistic,homosexual folk who did their jobs professionally. THEY were amongst the folks that tended to get merit based recognition, “awards”, and appropriate commensurate salaries.The “faggots”, homo and hetero, that brought ALL progress to a screaming halt to stage frequent personal drama scenes, seemed to be otherwise “unskilled” quota/nepotism/”someone’s” otherwise unemployable sex toy.IMHO, based on experience, 1.7%, (NOT the imaginary 3.7% “data point”) is a reasonable estimate for “flaming”(drama) queens that were coincidentally talented productive professionals, very efficiently pulling their weight toward the final product.
