        You want to know the other reason we are stupider? We have gone from words back to pictures. We no longer read words and visualize the descriptions in our minds. We just get pictures. I fully expect the icons on the next iPhones to be stick figures.

            I agree with this, but I’m not sure the causal arrows don’t point both ways. It used to be you had to have something on the ball to work in an office or a retail establishment. Everyone else worked in the fields, the factories, trades, etc. Then we shipped a lot of those jobs away or automated them. So, we dumbed down the office and retail jobs. I’m fond of pointing out that very smart people made it possible for very dumb people to overwhelm the smart people online.At the same time, when you live in a world of pictionary, you’re going to lose your edge, even if you are very bright. My attention span has shortened due to life on-line.

        I don’t see what the big deal is about a head transplant.Dr. Frankenstein successfully performed this feat well over a hundred years ago.They even made movies about it in the 1930s starring Boris Karloff though it  was tough to actually identify him on the screen as “the” Boris Karloff, what with those bolts sticking out of his neck,  the very limited dialogue he was given to work with and his bizarre, square shaped face which looked, amazingly enough , not too unlike those of American comic book action heroes.As an aside, eating eggs will kill you – clogged arteries and all; unless it is post, say, 2005, in which case eating eggs is now OK. That’s called scientific progress; post 2005 they got hens to lay healthy eggs but the previous 45 years the eggs would kill you because they fed hens junk food – potato chips, nitrate/nitrite laden beef jerky, cake, cookies, etc . Now they are feed broccoli, fresh fruit, fat-free yogurt, so all is fine…. nothing to now worry about other than global warming.

        I suspect people are getting stupider, not just more ignorant, although ignorance does  tend to beget stupid.OSHA has contributed to a dirty gene pool (Of course there are many other contributing factors far to numerous to mention here.). A machine shop  in the 20’s, with no belt or blade guards, open face carbon pile rheostats, continuous belt man lifts, etc.  would have a crew of  young workers followed by a 5 or 10 year age break and then older workers. The normal hazards of the workplace killed/culled the dumb ones leaving the smarter ones to produce the next generation.The acceptance of the outlandish in this century is, I think, due to a population that is both stupider and much more ignorant than that which welcomed in the last century, more so than just information overload.Science as perhaps 99.99% of the people today understand it is based on consensus, not on reproducible experimental results.News Reporters used to built stories around ‘who, what were, when. Today’s reporters are only interested in asking an interviewee/victim, -no matter if the story is about a hurricane, or a women’t bathroom or whatever; “And how did that make you feel?”It’s been many generations, I’ll say at least 4, for an arbitrary number, since critical thinking has been part of the national (Hell, not just national, the world. ) education system. If you are part of the 4 generation group I referred to above,  and you can indulge in critical thought, it is highly unlikely that you learned such skills within the walls of academia.This, the lack of any ability to weigh and evaluate data, to pursue a concept to a logical conclusion,  to critically evaluate the pros and cons of any statement containing more than one polysyllabic word, is, I think one of the ironies of the information age, -not the vast sea of data but the loss over the last few generations of skill sets necessary to process it.

        We’re outsourcing more and more of our intelligence.  A lot of people I know can’t navigate anymore since the GPS does that for them.I don’t think you upload your consciousness all at once.  You keep outsourcing bits of your intellect to the machines. Right now it’s your navigation and spelling skills. As interfaces become more facile and software becomes more accommodating, more and more gets outsourced.  Increasingly, it’s your memories, your motor skills (like backing up or parallel parking), or your social life (social media).In the end, all that remains outside the machine is the Will. By slow erosion, the rest of you has already been “Booleanized.” (I think that is the right word to describe the transition from the analog processes of the brain to the binary operation of the machines.)  I am not clear as to how one would accomplish uploading the Will, but no doubt someone will come up with an algorithm.I am not a huge fan of any of this. But humans are lazy, perverse, and willful, and l cannot foresee a future where humans do not continue to outsource our intellects to the machines up to the limits of the machines’ abilities.   So if the machines become capable enough for us to upload the Will, we will. If Moore’s Law loses its validity (we seem to have reached its limit in the silicon domain), then expect 10-20 more years of intellectual outsourcing as software catches up to hardware. Then, stagnation.

            I agree with you, el baboso, and unfortunately this turn from intellectual skills such as spelling and reading maps has devolved further to include information gathering. Mr. Google is everyone’s best friend, and what he doesn’t know, Mr. Wiki can answer. I love to be able to google quick facts, but I don’t use it as a substitute for acquiring real knowledge via books and research. An awful lot of people today want the quick answer, that really might not even be correct. How would they know if they don’t have the ability to research? Does anyone under the age of 30 even know how to read a map? Maybe the future of humans will not include problem-solving skills and this part of our brain will atrophy. Our robots will do our thinking for us. Sounds like a depressing future.

        Oh there you go with details.  Never mind.  To these guys, it appears they just think “parts is parts.”  You know, like a carburetor or solenoid or some other part.

        I can tell you what the reaction of most young people is to too much information–it is to believe what everybody in the room believes and hang on to that like it’s the nuclear football.

        I think the smart longevity money is on DNA retro-virus treatments followed by an endocrin reset.  Fix all the bad copies of cells, then reset hormones to a late-20’s level.  Taking the consciousness out of the body is way off.

            At 85 I’ve made a couple of mistakes and learned a few things. You can go screw your “reset hormones to a late-20’s level.” I wouldn’t remake those mistakes and relearn the things I’ve learned for all the bananas in Ecuador.

        Obscure SF show “The Collector” [it was about a man who, as penance of his own, collected souls for the Devil, more or less] had an episode in which a young woman who [I think] had been raped or suffered some other severe trauma turned her [coincidentally] top-drawer neurological and IT skills to creating a robot body for herself. Our anti-hero tried hard to persuade her it wouldn’t work. In the end she ‘ transferred her consciousness ‘ successfully but couldn’t make the body move and her thoughts [audible to the audience] took on an eerie mechanical quality.Now the subsequent conversation between the lead character and his master got a bit faux metaphysical, and relied on the notion that she could get all the nerve connections perfect and even transfer mind, memory, and even personality, but could not transfer “will” or motivation to move. That struck me as too pat by half. But at least the ending didn’t assume such a transfer would be easy given the neurological wiring knowhow.
