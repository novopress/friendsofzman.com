        Ooooo, INSTANT rebuttal to those in favor of “common sense” restrictions, to those folks who continue to ignoring the law of the land citing “shall not be infringed”, that cite “there’s no possible NEED for high capacity firearms magazines!By the way, pissing on a tree is considered a FELONY in SOME “districts”, generally ones with designated “Gun Free Zone” disaster sites.

        I’ve always thought Bracken’s cube is how a quote unquote race war would play out:https://westernrifleshooters.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/bracken-when-the-music-stops-how-americas-cities-may-explode-in-violence/

        I think Barry is a smart guy, but not a very worldly guy. In fact, he strikes me as a strangely naive person. I’ve always been struck by the fact no one notices he does not get much of a say in administration policy. Barry is just the ultimate ornament for the Cult of Modern Liberalism.The one true faith says the vanguard gets to run things when the society is a collection of groups jostling with one another for spoils. That’s why the Cult keeps trying to divide up the majority into smaller groups. The trouble they run into is keeping the less behaved from causing the rest to unite against them.In a way, the thing that allows the Cult to operate in modern America is what knocks it off its pegs. Picking at the scab of race relations works for a while, but then the blacks go berserk and everyone remembers why it is bad idea to let bitter weirdos gain power.

        I suspect a race war will be useful for some people politically. Useful  at least so long as it can be contained in areas of low interest and zero natural beauty. Once trouble spills over into more attractive areas then the restraining clamps will be fully engaged.
The media will then be instructed to make less of the “freedom and justice” angle and more of the “uncontrolled mayhem” coupled with “mindless violence.” Shortly after this the flame-lit ghettos will disappear from TV screens, and the rabble-rousers will lose their place at the table of plenty.

        Blacks will fall back to the tribe, I get that, but I think you mistake Barry’s tribe. I don’t sense that Barry likes Blacks. He loves Reds, and Blacks are not very good at juggling five lies in the air at one time into the shape of an immutable truth. Blacks are easy tools for Reds, and that is all they are.
