        It’s now coming out that a third of the DC District judges are foreigners who had no experience as judges. They are not us. Grog would know this.Grog would have known not to let them anywhere near the cave’s leadership council.If they tried to usurp the cave leader’s authority — or made big trouble — Grog would’ve felt no guilt in kicking them out of the cave. Let’s be like Grog.

        These zealots are mainly, although not exclusively, women and powered by Jews. To save the people from these forces women need to return to their logical roles in society and Jews need to be stripped of power. The American people have no appetite for either yet. But increasingly Americans are starting to notice what is going on.

            Bingo. I said as much in my comment. The big issue is Jews. Jewish identity – their folk religion – is now centered on the WWII Holocaust mythology. If you put yourself in their shoes, you can see that there’s no possibility to make a deal with whites or, really, any group. They have to control of the narrative/society’s morality or risk (in their minds) being shipped away to “death camps” in Ohio.
The WWII Holocaust narrative has made Jews relationship with any group, but especially whites, a cage death match that they simply can’t lose.

                    The Holocaust narrative has changed Jews’ relationship with the world. There can be zero compromise. They used to worry about pogroms (likely exaggerated admittedly), which meant that they could deal with the locals but they had to be careful. Now, anytime the locals get uppity, it’s death for all Jews. With that mindset, you have to control the locals completely.

                        Absolutely.  This, 1000%, because this mindset was baked into the cake ages ago, and  they are a decidely capable near-peer smart enough to be truly dangerous.  (Baked because it is a genetic response to unimaginable environmental catastrophe.)
However, we’re going to run into the headwinds of the Semite-allergic. They prefer equalism.
Not untrue; just as we can be taught a jewish mindset, so can any man or woman be taught a criminal mindset.

                    I should probably note that the Holocaust narrative has changed the relationship of Jews who don’t live in Israel with their host countries and populations. Israelis have their homeland so I’d suspect that the Holocaust narrative, while still very central, doesn’t quite have the grip as Jews living as a tiny minority.

                        If videos out of Israel are any indication, they are as much stuck on victimhood as their Diaspora brethren.  This is the problem with holocaustianity.  Other groups have been attacked in this way, but none of those other groups reacted the same way even generations later.
The Armenians, for example.  Can you imagine a small hat Anna Kasparian working for the Nazi equivalent of “The Young Turks” (the name of the group responsible) who also deny the holocaust?  Even if you could find one, her fellows would eat her alive for appearing on it.

                            Oh damn. Anna Kasparian on “The Young Turks.”
It was Kemal Attaturk’s Young Turks, funded by Jewish backers, who committed the Genocide the same years as the Bolshevik Revolution and the attempted German Communist Party takeover of Bavaria, 1915-1921. They got bucket-load of Greek lands out of it too.
(Seeing pictures of what they did, especially main roads lined with crosses of crucified naked Armenian girls…these creatures are demons with a sick, sick sense of humor.)

                        The Narrative is much stronger in those not rooted in their ‘homeland’. They have nothing else they can point to and say, “we were here, long ago.”
The Narrative is the only root they have, the only bona fides that they must stridently reaffirm.
Oddly, though many were here in the Revolution, and in many places where great history occured, they never proudly emphasize, “my ancestors were in…”

                        Israeli youth is heavily indoctrinated and brainwashed into the cult.For that reason Israeil visits to Auschwitz are conducted in such a manner as to maximize psychological trauma.Each tourist group is isolated by their armed guards from Shin Bet to prevent any contact with the locals. Paranoia is further amplified by the Israeli “guides” whose main objective is to propagandize those teenagers into believing those atrocities can happen again, hence the constant protection detail and the restriction of freedom (they can’t leave the hotel on their own). In case any gentile manages to get close, they are immediately and brutally subdued by Shin Bet officers and marked as anti-semites.Jewish identity is founded on mental abuse, that would’ve been described as psychopathic in any other nation. The accounts of those visits commonly feature the outbursts of hysteria and anger among those young people when they’re subjected to the story of Holocaust as narrated by their guides. Upon returning they eventually enter the mandatory military service where this conditioning it refined by instilling a Stalwart Defender ethos.The only way to counter it, is for a Jew to visit Poland on their own.“Never again” has been invented primarly for the Jews, to prevent any future complacency in the face of adversity.

                No, not really.  The problem is having capable foreigners in your country.  Foreigners will always agitate for what they perceive as being good for them.  Since they view themselves as the world’s oldest victims (they will tell you “antisemitism” is the world’s oldest bigotry), things like equality and accommodating foreign minorities are ideals they push.  They like to pretend it’s because they are such good and moral people who want to help others, but it is really just self-preservation.  Being tolerant of the “other” is really just “please don’t kill us,” never mind the fact that we never wanted to do that.But if it wasn’t them, it would be some other group we were foolish enough to let in.

                            We have Chinese spies all over the place who pretend they are American.  They have every bit the superiority complex as any small hat.  They have no problem throwing racist and racism around at us.  The CCP was just lecturing us the other day about all of our supposed racism.  Though I grant they are using it as a rhetorical weapon knowing how our leaders fret about racism.Indians out Jewed the small hats in the diamond industry, for example.  They are as or more ethnocentric than the small hats.  You hire 1 pajeet and before you know it, half the staff are pajeets.  Unlike the small hats, there are a lot of them, probably even more pajeets than Han.

                    It’s a funny bait, innit?  They say “please be tolerant, don’t be racist” when we we’re all perfectly nice and welcoming people to begin with.  But it’s not really a plea.  it’s a slur, it’s an insult, it’s an EXHORTATION to be “racist.”  They want us to be “racist” so you can be the bad guy, they can claim victimhood and then strike.
If you weren’t a “racist” before, you become a “racist” after they call you one a thousand times.

                    Have to disagree somewhat. Yes, having a capable minority in your society will always cause some issues, but few groups (if any) are so determined to change the host society like Jews.
They really are a special group. Maybe the Brahmins will turn out the same. We’ll see.

                        The will to change. This is why the Finkels catch so much flack. If they would simply accept their host countries the way they are and content themselves with becoming obscenely rich, there would be no backlash against them. But no. Because of their sense of superiority, they believe it is their right to make the host country “better,” never minding that the host people like their country just fine the way it is and don’t want to see it transmogrified into something they find detestable and unrecognizable. Moreover, the will to change seems to be almost uniquely Jewish. The Chinks and Subcons are a rather competent people, but I don’t see them spearheading a fundamental transformation of the West. And to the extent that they might, they’re simply mimicking the Finkels.

                            Ohio is great at electing really terrible “Republicans” like DeWine, Boehner, Portman and most lately Moreno.
I bet most people even in the state don’t realize that Moreno is the scion of a powerful Colombian political family — his brother and father are/were major Colombian political figures. If that’s not a huge conflict of interest, I don’t know what is.
Also, a couple years before he ran, he was getting awards from gay rights organizations, then all of a sudden he does a 180 and is Mr. Family Values to pick up the Trump endorsement. A total snake.

                    There is, a lot of wishful thinking among the right. A big reason is that once your eyes are opened, clown world seems ripe for a fall. But it took 100 plus years for us to get in this mess and it won’t change overnight

                        We are rapidly approaching the final crisis, which will likely (I’m guessing, of course) center around the 2032 election cycle. B/c normie still believes in voting.

                “Shame and guilt were not natural to men until introduced by devilish forces.” We, and our women, the lusted-for Aryan ‘Eve’, were the “devilish forces,” per the racial propaganda.  But…Nonwhites, and especially consanguinous jews, have a feminine brain. The circuitry operates in a feminine manner. I call it “the breeder brain” for this reason. The Latin term used for the backbrain is ‘insula’, that is, ‘doorway’…strangely accurate, because the insula is the ‘antenna’ for the frequency range of Hell’s bestial background function.It is not that either women or nonwhites areevil.It is that they arevulnerable.They are open to the dull background roar of a part of nature doing what it is meant to do.  Hell is actually a background function with no off switch.

            I’m sure someone has crunched these numbers before: If a black town with population B integrates with a white town with population W, then the likelihood of the following for whites increases by: +R% rape, +M% murder, +A% assault or robbery.
If whites knew these statistics would it matter?
I’m fighting the belief that the kind of whites who would have fought this integration was mostly killed in the world wars. Our lost warrior Christians and Vikings.
If so, our only hope of awakening traditional whites and others may be destroying the media, which dictates our morality.

        I suppose this anti-Christian religion/zealotry has been around a long time, but it gained traction in the 1960’s.  It was your fuddy duddy parents and grandparents deal.  It wasn’t good enough to women, to blacks, to swarths, to homos, or to crazies who think they are something they are biologically not.  Something “new” was needed that accepted every form of degeneracy and rejected the “old” morality.  And here we are.  I doubt reform or a change in diet is going to work.  Radical surgery is the only way forward that has a chance.

            I wonder if this is a problem that’ll solve itself?  The faithful self segregate, they and their descendants reap the fruits of their faith… the cancerous form together in clumps and reap the fruits of their malignant beliefs together.  Obviously, reality will not work out that cleanly, but this is the trend that I’ve observed in my life.  Put another way – we’re witnessing another iteration in evolution, happening much faster now due to the speed that technology has changed society in the past couple generations.

                “I wonder if this is a problem that’ll solve itself?”One can’t be sure, that is the conundrum. Here’s an (possibly useful) example from my past with Game &amp; Fish in my State.We had a section of the State where the predator population (Coyote) was out of balance with the prey (Elk). The old theory that predator levels would decline as prey levels fell did not hold for Coyotes since the Coyotes would eat anything to survive—seeds, berries, rodents, etc.The situations was so bad that for a couple of years no yearling Elk were recorded being born and survive in that area. The Elk were headed for extinction, and quickly. In those days, the answer was “depredation” hunting. Volunteers were organized and pickup trucks were soon filled with dead Coyotes. These hunts were protested (of course) and stopped. I lost track of the situation thereafter.It seems entirely possible that a smallish, yet adaptive, population succumb to the larger maladaptive population before survival of the fittest asserts itself.

                    Exactly what I am afraid of.  Only 740 million of us left.We were outnumbered 10 to one a few years ago.  Now it’s 11 to 1.
I found out, being unfamiliar with hunting, that this is why deer hunting is encouraged.  They want you to take the ones with one horn or malformed horns, to prevent excessive inbreeding or deformation to ensure the long term health of the herd.

            What will your radical surgery lead to? What flourishes like noxious weeds after that?Trinitarianism collapsed because it could not withstand close scrutiny. Recall for instance what our astronomers and physicists have learned about thisvastHeavenless cosmos. Jesus’ moral teachings (e.g. about judgement) tend to be sloppy, rabble rousing, sentimental, or self-serving. The old morality is authoritarian, too—giving orders and demanding obedience, like in any military. The whole affair began with and is inseverable from Israel’s nationalist supremacism, which Jesus affirmed several times in different ways.The cult of Jesus, unlike so-called Hinduism, leaves apostates with few or no materials to recycle for new and better use, as did Gotama when he rejected Vedism and the pomposity of the Brahmins. So here we are, suffering fragmentation, democracy, degeneracy, disintegration, and nihilism.

Your glorious astrophysicists are babies, slapping at the sides of the crib and thinking themselves brilliant.
‘The cult of Jesus, unlike so-called Hinduism, leaves apostates. . . ‘ blah blah blah
Yes, if only we embraced Hinduism and the East, all would be well.  All that Eastern mysticism from the Sixties turned out great, remember?  A real boon to the culture.  Just the antidote the nation needed for that ruinous Cult of Jesus that the people followed!
Hey thanks a lot for checking in, Huma.

I just noticed, because I used to have the same gut reaction, that what makes even honest atheists mad, is treating mythic allegory as science.  That’s like getting mad at an Aesop story.

            “Shame and guilt were not natural to men until introduced by devilish forces.” We, and our women, the lusted-for Aryan ‘Eve’, were the “devilish forces,” per the racial propaganda. But…Nonwhites, including consanguinous jews, have a feminine brain. The circuitry operates in a feminine manner. I call it “the breeder brain”, because it achieves the essential bestial ends, and doesn’t get much further.The Latin term used for the backbrain is ‘insula’, that is, ‘doorway’…strangely accurate, because the insula is the ‘antenna’ for the frequency range of Hell’s bestial background function, the ‘driver’, in computer parlance.It is not that either women or nonwhites areevil.It is that they arevulnerable.They are open to the dull background roar of a part of nature doing what it is meant to do. Hell is actually a background function with no off switch.We’re looking at a dual immaterial/material ecology at work here.Not that we can change nature; the purpose of intelligence is to ameliorate it, to tame its effects.You want a muscular Christianity, maintaining strong men? Have one that speaks to the knowledge of the 21st Century, rather than one suited to the knowledge of the First.Otherwise, you have rote dictate, based on different conditions, like using an outdated manual for a different line of cars, translated from a different language at that.Those writers, in their time, were the most advanced science…of their time.Were we not meant to live?  To not prepare the ground?  Shall we return to oxen-yoked plows, then, and bronze tools?

        Another way of stating it is, can the cancer be put into remission or must it be removed?In my mind this question has already been answered for quite some time.  As the true believers become more unhinged and more emboldened, the clear answer is removal.  And for this angry Gen Xer, I wish for that removal to be as painful as possible.  I do not wish to compromise with them, share a country with them or have them breath my air.  I wish them the very worst hell could ever offer.  They have ruined everything that was once pure and beautiful, and they’ve taken away my homeland.

        They’ll need to be removed. First, the money and brains of the zealots are Jews. Jews will not give up their folk religion – which is now centered around the WWII Holocaust narrative which makes it absolutely antithetical to whites. Jews will not be converted nor will make a deal in good faith to back off and leave us alone.
Second, a huge portion of women and the mutants will not return to a code of living that adhere to nature’s hierarchy, not without a fight.

            People have started to accept what you set forth at a subconscious level. “Deportation,” “remigration,” and so forth are euphemisms for removal. People already are self-segregating and sorting and moving to enclaves, and slowly but surely reasons such as “good schools” and “country living” are not given. They know now but just won’t say it yet. It will be awful when the rubber hits the road, but dems the breaks.

            In our cradle, Europe, we must attend first to Jews in their evangelistic form, the Muslims. Both are Seeds of Abraham.Islam began as a Maccabbean sect in 159 BC, when the High Priest killed the sect’s leader in a brutal public example. 180 years later, surviving remnants of that sect accepted Jesus as a prophet, and began war beside the Talmuds in forcibly converting those who accepted Jesus as God.Jews, Romans, Arabs, pagans, who accepted the the Heresy, the Stain being erased by Israel in Palestine, by their Muslim half-brothers in Syria, and by the neocons in Ukraine.﻿

        The issue is that the prevailing ‘morality’ and narrative – call it ‘reason’ if you will although it is nothing of the sort – has no basis in either biological relatedness, geographical territory, or religious faith.  There is no common genetics, language, culture, or ethics.  The left tells me that there is no biological reality other than the ‘human race,’ and that anyone born on the dirt or within the air space of a particular nation state, and/or granted magic papers declaring them to be, is my ‘fellow citizen.’  The cuckservatards tell me that everyone from the furthest reaches of the globe is my ‘neighbor’ to whom I owe biblically prescribed treatment.  The churchians say that neither biology nor geography are any impediment to faith-based ‘brotherhood,’ which then demands I make anyone my geographical neighbor and member of my biological family.  The Pope says Islam is the brother of Christianity, and the Church of England defrocks priests who don’t observe magic pronouns, but ‘priestesses’ are a long overdue correction of doctrinal error.  Jews tell us that Jerusalem was the foundation of the ‘west,’ and they are the ‘elder brothers in faith to Christians, although the presumptuous faker Jesus is justly boiling in a vat of shit.Meanwhile, the smartest and most capable scientists evah are busy creating artifical wombs and ‘creating’ men and women via scalpel while simultaneously insisting there is no biological difference.  Forensic pathologists can determine race, sex, and age via minimal human remains but I’m told thatrace and sex are social constructs (and they’re working hard towards ending the appearance of aging).  I’m not to notice any human differences – except always display cultural sensitivity and pay homage to those who are physically and cognitavely ‘differently abled.’  And never touch black hair!It’s a mass of contradictions and lies and people accept it with aplomb.  Some decry certain excesses, such as transgender butchery – but simultaneously demand in vitro fertilization and rent-a-wombs.  Any degeneracy is fine within the ‘privacy’ of one’s home, and mostly in public libraries and parades, but heterosexual couples engaging in sexual activity in public are arrested for public lewdness. Noticing anyone’s skin tone or accent or faith is either rude, criminalized, or celebrated depending on the thoughts and intentions of the noticer.I will not accommodate evil and insanity.  I will not comply with authority.  I will not live with those who hate me and my progeny.  No compromise, no ‘live and let live.’  No ‘peaceful separation.’  The world today and for all of human history has been who/whom.  We either create a future for White children or we – and all our works – vanish from history.

            My impression, as an uninterested non-expert who only learns about catholicism incidentally to other things, is that it’s always been that way.The church is worldly/progressive. The people resist it until they’re replaced by people who don’t. In the past that replacement was generational, and in the present (since ~1700) it’s racial. The shepherd has changed his flock, from European toother.My wife is a Roman Catholic (almost literally) and thinks my impression is correct—but that the church is in some sense “true.” As well as I can understand that, it means that there was some past time when the church wasinspiredon each question of doctrine/etc. Since then it’s become wrong about almost all of them, but there’s some sense, inscrutable to me, in which the church remains what it was—at nospecifictime, but always, but definitely not now.Obvious analogy to American patriotic conservatism there. And perhaps not coincidentally, both institutions are thoughtby believers in themto be run by Satanic pedophiles.Religion is really not my thing.

                “Religionis not really my thing.”
All living bodies die. Then what? Is a human’s life just a short voyage from ashes to ashes and from dust to dust, like materialists believe?
Loners (i.e. the irreligious) can experience transcendance but often fare poorly among the worldly, esp. when the latters’ religion is democracy, internationalist communism, marketism, or national socialism (as in the cases of Jews and most of the USA’s “Black Lives”). Not having a religion, therefore, is like not having the teamwork to keep aggressive, predatory animals at bay.

                    Maybe Hemid’s just drawn towards the practical, like many (most) religious are, and doesn’t feel like he needs to worry about the “Then what?” question.
Do you notice, Ride By, how you conflated two differerent questions to set up the framing for an argument?
I have to say, though, “Not having a religion, therefore, is like not having the teamwork to keep aggressive, predatory animals at bay” is pretty right on the the money, it’s where the reality hits.

        Guilt and shame are not the same. Guilt is internal regret. Shame is external public humiliation. Shame results from having disappointed the tribe, guilt from disappointing yourself, although there may be external consequences.Probably, guilt as such did not exist in primitive man. Perhaps there was regret, once contingency was understood, but Grog didn’t flagellate himself over it. He made what he thought was the right decision at the time.  No crying over spilt milk.Some people think the Jews invented guilt, and then the Catholics perfected it. Be that as it may, the difference between shame and guilt is the difference between Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel.Another difference is that shame, however painful, is rarely pathological in the way that guilt can be. Guilt can cripple you for life, if you let it. Judas didn’t hang himself for shame. Furthermore, guilt has become a powerful tool for the clever to manipulate the simple.Seems like we could learn a thing or two from Grog.

        The question at the heart of the crisis is can the fury of these zealots be reoriented toward a folk religion or even a passive universalism?Probably not. So we go back to Zman’s premise, which is biological reality. These zealots won’t reproduce and won’t be around for the future. They will be crowded out/replaced by people who know who they are and what they are trying to accomplish.

        The Book of Genesis wasn’t a ‘story’ but (greatly) compressed history, underlined by the rampant fact that the Western World is failing and falling due PRECISELY to the twin sins-of-Eden: the propensity of the female to seek power beyond her station, and the propensity of the male to abet and obey her . . . to effect her ‘sovereignty’, as they called feminism in the old days.The ancient world was dominated by a smorgasbord of fertility/goddess religions — mother-cult variants — as both Scripture and secular scholarship show. The prophets of the, ahem, ‘sky god’ didn’t make him up whole cloth on a slow Wednesday morning; they communed and interacted with the Biblical God to effect miraculous changes in this world.The audience that chopped up 450 of Jezebel’s false-prophets one fine afternoon didn’t obey Elijah because his words were persuasive, but because God’s hand manifestly fell upon Elijah’s side. (That was before hi-tech could fake God efficiently.)The Biblical God was not a clever theory conjured by unemployed priests, nor an aftereffect of monotheistic pharaohs in Dynastic Egypt, but an introduction of this world to its rightful Father.

            “the propensityof the male…”An important—but oft overlooked—lesson to learn from Bereshit 1-3 is that Adam was a weak man formed in the image and likeness of weak elohim. Or yhvh. Thepropensityof Adam must have been the propensity of elohim, too, given the alleged likeness. If they lacked the propensity, the alleged likeness must be a big lie given the importance of the propensity to the mentality and behavior of Adam. Makers who are perfect and ommipotent (in the sense held by your sect) would have no impediment to building a much better first man. You fail to understand this given your narrow literalism and an idolatrous prejudice in favor of a failed Führer.

            I agree. It seems impossible to label the faith of the Baby Killing Communist Pedophile movement as some kind of evolution into a moral code based on reason. Rather pride, hubris, insanity all attended by the entire remaining catalogue of mortal and venal sins. It is a leap of faith in the self as the ultimate authority, a deliberate choice (if you believe in free will) to reject a higher authority, even in the form of received wisdom and moral cosmology. In any case, paraphrasing Derb, reason is very low on the list of behavior drivers for most people and the more diligent one’s attempts to adhere to a behavior code founded on it are the less normally human you appear to your fellows.We all know where this is going. There is no foundation of shared reality upon which to engage in a dialogue with the BKCP and achieve some accommodation that permits coexistence. They are indeed a kind of civilizational cancer, a malignant mutation largely triggered by a parasitical infection. It is right and natural to attempt to eradicate it completely.

            From the Enlightenment until the second half of the 1960s, Leftists believed, with a certain amount of justification, that they were the exponents of reason. And it was during this period that atheism, along with the rejection of everything spiritual and religious, became synonymous with Leftism. However, along with the postmodern turn of the sixties came the derogation of reason and the transfiguration of cultural relativism. And it is this relativism that has since underpinned all of the madness that has been unleashed upon the West.But there remains an antinomy that holds sway in geopolitics, namely that, despite the adherence to cultural relativism, the Blackberry Fruitcake Empire and its subsidiary European cupcakes, sees fit to bully and bomb every nation that refuses to spread its cheeks for diversity and perversity as the pinnacle of morality. In other words, the BFE, despite its relativism, refuses to model that relativism in its geopolitics. The BFE preaches relativism but practices absolutism. And it does this in the name of sweet reason. After all, only an irrational maniac could object to Nurse Ratched slicing off little Caleb’s schlong and replacing it with a naugahyde vajajay.

                “From the Enlightenment until the second half of the 1960s, Leftists believed, with a certain amount of justification, that they were the exponents of reason.”
Not to be pedantic here, but they weren’t “leftists,” they were classical liberals. Leftism is a post-industrial, post-modern ideological construct. “Liberalism” is the application of reason and the Scientific Method during the Enlightenment.

                    Call them what you like, but they were on the left and were certainly the ancestors of today’s Leftists. The West’s Left-Right political schema was born during the French Revolution.
Or, a Leftist by any other name stinks just as badly.

        Religion aside, I find the assumptions that motivate our overlords to be unreasonable and based on fantasies about human nature. In fact, they seem to reject the very notion of human nature.

            Yes. It is based on hysteria. It is a woman who is desparate for Daddy to get tired of her bullshit and show her her place, and then, please please please throw me against a wall and fuck me.There is a logic to it, but it isn’t reasonable.The other problem with this post is that it is too logical. We are in the looting phase of civilizational collapse. The looters invariably side with the hysterics because by progroming Western man you force his wealth out of his hands. You create a loyal class of patrons with high time preference who will transfer it to you pretty quickly for trinkets. They also want to dissolve everything into a single market.At the same time, the hysterics are in the nest with people for whom our dispossession is perfectly logical. Jasmine Crockett, Van Jones … … appear hysterical but they are merely after a fat and juicy roast. They don’t worship a god of reason they worship acquisition of things without having to make cognitive and labor investment to obtain them.Of course there is a faction that created this coalition that has seen it blow up in their faces. Their current approach is to unleash massive, directed suppression that is not based on a universal standard but on only their specific cause/requirement.It is every man for himself. We just swapped the gay race communist looters for the same people who swooped in to loot the post-Soviet Russia.Occidental man needs to find himself and do it quickly. He needs to assert himself with calm and strength. That may reduce the faction of hysterics – White women who are deeply confused because they are alone. Gay friends only make them more hysteric – long for real masculinity more deeply. Occidental man stepping back into himself and establishing authority over himself and sticking up for himself may just be the moment where things quiver and moisten – ‘Oh. He set a boundary. Maybe he will throw me against the wall and fuck me too.’The issue isn’t God. The issue is nature. You make and defend your claims or you live in slavery or you perish if the conqueror doesn’t want to chance that you will not make a good slave.

                Rejection of nature (or at least overcoming it) seems to be a decision that occidental man made long ago – and I think it’s part of what’s made our civilization so successful technologically… far more than any civ that came before.  Yet, the piper must be paid eventually…

                    Yes. But, discarding with the transcendant and the mystery is a recent phenomena. Turning the universe into a clock was a catastrophic error.The other thing we have not yet reckoned with, and I am the first person I know to be talking about this is our conception of technology. Even that has been removed by schism.Occidental man’s foundational technology is Our sophisticated set of social technologies. They are the basis for our ability to develop the empirical technologies and bring them in to an ordered world that still makes room for the metaphysical. We are beating our head against a wall thinking the problem is just that we are stagnating technologically. No. We have destroyed our social technology and its application. This is why the new oligarchy is just more of the same. The techno optimist is sure the problem is they just need to develop more efficient and useful technology.I call this Thiel syndrome. That is a good impulse. But, without our social technology and the metaphysics to develop our spirit that will only hasten the destruction. In other words, Alex Karp isn’t going to save “The West.” You can’t save what you don’t understand. He is going to further its destruction.

                        The function of our advanced culture depends on being run by high trust individuals. Our society seems to have lost the capacity to either make or install the right kind of people in the necessary positions. The amoral me first mentality that has permeated our institutions is destroying them by exponential decline; it is to the point nearly nothing functions properly at the federal level.The only likely solution is to rebuild after it all collapses. The corruption runs too deep to root out. Maybe the next group will be able to do better. Our institutions failed at the individual level from the top to the bottom.

                        Good point on the social technology piece – I’d never thought of technology in that frame before.The thing to remember with Alex Karp is that he’s a salesman first and foremost – he does believe the things he says (a good salesman always does) – but the grandiose proclamations about saving the west are a sales tactic (like a lot of the mystique around Palantir).  It has good products, but it’s not the manhattan project.The Thiel impulse is faustian, and I think Spengler was right that it’s the driving force of our civilization.  Musk embodies this well… this spark to reach for the stars, to expand, to conquer, to colonize, to overcome.  Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot of silliness that comes out of that valley, and the latest B2B SAAS AI generated powerpoint creator isn’t exactly faustian.  But the drive is still there, and it’s what separates the West from Hindu civ, or Islamic civ, or Han civ, or even Roman civ.

                            True. 2 years ago he sold Palantir to Sweden because it could prevent terrorist attacks. The problem wasn’t inviting terrorists in. In fact, a problem his technology could be a solution for. Problems good!
Now, those unruly people threaten his people so good excuse to do even more surveillance and sell more product and use it to deport the baddies that threaten his narrow interest group.

                            Yes. But, a drive that is misdirected is problematic. Mars can’t be colonized without Earth as a base just as North and South America couldn’t have been without Europe as a base. This is even more true.First priority and first principle is to save yourself from immediate danger. Musk like Karp is a salesman. He had no qualms lying that nuclear energy was inferior to solar and wind when he wanted to goose subsidies and sales of solar panels and battery backup farms. He quietly slid away from that grift. Similarly he had no qualms about the lie of CAGW when he could get subsidies and sales from having the EEV solution to stopping CAGW.All of these guys are not civilizational. They are merchants. Can some change and take up the mantle of civilization first? We will see.

                                You make some good points, RR, and I agree that Musk is an excellent salesman.  I’d say that Musk is absolutely civilizational, and acting in his own interest doesn’t negate that.  Many of the civilizational figures of the West’s past were absolutely acting in their own interests.  Think of Cortez, the early explorers, Washington, Jackson, Napoleon, Edison, the frontiersmen of America, etc.  The grift doesn’t negate the greatness – and landing re-usable rockets is absolutely a great technical feat.  His sales skills have inspired many technical talents away from societal zero sum careers like finance, law, into engineering.  This has been a great development for a stagnating civilization.

it is an even more untenable coalition and will unravel very quickly. The host population cannot withstand much more parasitism. I also would submit much of the current disintegration is the result of the Puritan prong of the previous coalition coming to terms with the reality that the Judeo prong needed to be put into its place.

You create a loyal class of patrons with high time preference who will transfer it to you pretty quickly for trinkets’Exactly.  That’s what Consumer America and Mall Culture were all about.  It was a Barbie Paradise, not a nation.A staggering, unprecedented transfer of wealth and power was effected right in front of our noses, yet invisible. From Western man to Western woman, their elite-level looters (the Regime), and to allied factions — the blacks, the homos, the transgender Eskimos. To anybody and everybody except the Ebil Ebil White Male.An enormous portion of practical law now is based on facilitating this ongoing degradation and impoverishment of, well, us.  Ain’t nobody ‘reforming’ this.

        It is reason that tells us that there must be one way of organizing society. It is reason that tells us there must be one moral code.No, the little devil PRIDE says that to us. “Reason” is merely the tool men use to elevate their own moral code and place it above all others.We observe that men are universally born with a sense of fairness. The ancients used to call that inborn knowing the Law of Nature. More specifically, the Law of Human Nature.We observe that law of nature growing over time into moral codes that vary from place to place, within various tribes. Of course, we all like our own tribe’s moral code better than anyone else’s. Just as we like our own traditions and customs better. Hooray for our side.That same self-centeredpridethat convinces us our code, and our religion, should be the one size that fits all. *Then* we use reason to justify our pride. Note that Islam and Christianity are both proselytizing religions, and they are PROUD of their efforts to spread the faith.Godless atheists are the same when they choose collectivism as their religion. Pride tells them they themselves are little gods, and except for them, the universe is empty and meaningless.So they try to fill that emptiness without God. They pridefully reason that collectivism is for everyone! They also are proud to proselytize, to spread their godless code everywhere. For universal fairness, of course.

        This Z-man post is a brilliant and succinct examination of a fundamental question. I comment on one of his observations:“The trading of women, which we know was a part of early man’s existence, was one solution.”This extended beyond the binding of small groups in amalgamation process to bonding between groups too large for joining.“With regard to the girl, my daughter, about whom you wrote to me in view of marriage: she has become a woman, she is nubile. Just send a delegation to fetch her.” –King Kadashman-Enlil of Babylonia to Pharaoh Amenhotep III of Egypt, from the Amarna Letters (a collection of mostly diplomatic correspondence found in Egypt but written in Akkadian cuneiform, thelingua francaof their day.It exemplifies the kind of relations that exist between normal groups that cannot share a polity, but who can coexist as long as they each have separate polities. The Hittite and Egyptian empires clashed in Canaan at the Battle of Kadesh in Canaan. It was the battle with the most chariots in human history, a titanic (for the time) battle which essentially ended in a draw but whose bloodletting gave both sides pause. It led to the first ‘international’ treaty in history, where both sides in writing demarcated their respective spheres of influence.These two sides were perfectly willing to kill each others soldiers in a bid to conquer the other, to impose their will. Later, when the Hittites were suffering from the megadrought that played a central role in the late Bronze Age collapse, the Egyptians sent food aid from their still Nile-overflow-fertilized farmlands. Thus, both sides were conquerors of civilizational patterns, rather than exterminatory destroyers. They did not wish for the other side to VANISH.Contrast the behaviors of these ancient peoples with the behavior of those who have originated, organized, and executed the Great Replacement, a project designed to make European people extinct from this Earth. It is clear that groups of people on this Earth can be binned into one of two categories, conquerors of patterns (genetic and memetic[cultural]) and destroyers of patterns. One can also speak of a 3rd category, ‘defenders of patterns’, who seek only to be left alone. The Progressive would call them ‘isolationist’ as a slur as if there were something morally wrong with not wanting to harm others while also not wanting to allow others to harm one’s own. A people can of course be in different categories at different times in their history.I think it is one reason I have seen several gestures of condemnation for the Great Replacement from individuals from groups I know very well DO NOT LIKE US at all. No one likes seeing genocide, even if in slow motion as is our ongoing destruction, because in the victims they can see themselves. It’s not a lot different than if you feud with your neighbor, but a pack of hungry wolves come eat one of your neighbor’s children and are circling his homestead trying to get at the rest. You cannot tolerate the wolves because eventually your children will be on the menu. The people behind the Great Replacement mean ill for all of humanity, and in that respect pattern conquerors and pattern defenders have a mutual interest in neutralizing the pattern destroyer.

        What we may be looking at is just natural selection at work.  As Z stated, the religions practiced were the ones adaptive to humanity’s technological and civilizational situation at that time.  The Jewish ethno-religion is poorly adapted to having their own state since it renders them incapable of dealing with other people with the sense of fairness required to keep the peace, just like how Grog’s tribal God stopped helping once agriculture came along and he had to tolerate having neighbors.  As consequence Jews have had to speciate and function as a sort of relict deviation from human evolution, parasitizing the Goyim and evolving an advanced capacity for verbal manipulation in order to avoid the wrath of the Universalists’ moral hostility to their psychological tendencies.All of this has to be a combination of genes and culture since both feed back on each other.  We instinctively distrust a little rat-faced gremlin like Ben Shapiro because the folks before us who trusted little rat-faced gremlins had fewer offspring, and alongside that we told each other tales about rat-faced gremlins stealing children and spinning straw into gold.

        “…the sense of guilt and shame was probably as primitive as the moral code that existed within the group.”Guilt and shame is the evolutionary answer to basic “instinct” in group oriented animals. Instinct was—before humans evolved—the foundation of survival for all higher order species.  As our brains enlarged and proto-humans evolved, instinct proved too slow and limited to keep up with human advancement as a species in a rapidly changing environment.This was the key to human survival.  Heretofore every other animal species faced with a rapidly changing environment, yet limited to a preset body of behavioral instructions,  became extinct.  Guilt and shame are simply aspects of what we broadly call “culture”.  Culture as we know is downstream from biology.  In that concept, guilt and shame understandably vary from race to race—and is why race mixing in an evolutionary sense is deadly for the species, or races.  It is against the Natural order.

        “There’s no point in denying that different groups have fundamental moral disagreements. It’s obviously true. For example, gays in America get parades; gays in some Islamic countries get thrown off the roofs of buildings. Can either group convince the other to change its mind? Probably not.That leaves us with the second question: In case of disagreement, do human groups have a right to force their moral views on the other groups?If we answer ‘yes,’ then the inevitable result is either perpetual war (if no group can dominate the others) or tyranny (if one group can win). History suggests that no group can permanently dominate the others, so we end up with perpetual war. At least in theory, nobody wants that. In practice, we’d like to avoid it.It’s hard to make a case for tolerance of diverse beliefs and behaviors if we think we’ve got a monopoly on moral truth. That kind of belief makes us go ‘in search of monsters to destroy,’ whether the monsters are political, religious, ethnic, or simply people who differ from us.”— Why Sane People Believe Crazy Things: How Belief Can Help or Hurt Social Peace

        There is no alternative to religion, because a society is based on the law. The law must allow things and forbid things. Of course, it will allow things that it will consider as good and it will forbid things that will consider as bad. So there must be a definition of good and evil, upon which the law is based. And this is a religion: a definition of good and evil (no gods required: Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism are religions with no gods attached)If the law is based on a religion, it is called an “official religion”. For non-official religions, they may be tolerated or forbidden.So, yes, it is a war of religions: the woke religion against the previous official religions: 1. The Christian religion (this was never official in America but it was in England) 2. The “conservative” religion defined by the Constitution, which, with some changes, was official until the 1960s.All traditional religions share a set of norms called “natural law”: don’t kill, don’t sleep with another man’s woman, don’t cheat, etc. The appendix of “The Abolition of Man” by C.S.Lewis provides examples from multiple religions. They share this because the natural law is the morality core that makes a society sustainable and all traditional religions have existed for long time. This natural law is biological and is imprinted in the human mind, so you feel guilt when you violate (for Christians, it is inRomans 2:14-15). Although your culture can mitigate this guilt, it cannot totally disappear for all people. Most of what fuels the woke religion is trying to mitigate this biological guilt, but I cannot explain this here.The problem of the woke religion is not that this a religion (this is unavoidable). It is that it is not based on natural law. So castrating children is an abomination for Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and every other past or present religion. Since it is not based on natural law, the religion is not sustainable and a) the religion disappears or b) the society based on this religion disappears.

            “The Christian religion (this was never official in America but it was in England) … .”
The English Church was established by law and supported by taxation in all the Southern provinces (Maryland to Georgia) until the 1777 constitutions of the newly independent states, and in some of the Northern provinces, and the Congregationalist Church was established by law and supported by taxation in New England–until well into the 19th century (1828, I think, in Massachusetts).

            The atheist Sam Abrams refers to your “Natural Law” as “Rational Morality”.It seems the current Christian based morality is the best and right morality but that does not mean it is rational or natural. The human being can justify anything it needs to in order to survive. The Aztecs sacrificing virgins to get a good crop was perfectly reasonable to keep the rest of the group fed. The Mongols and the Khans were a warrior culture. The ability to kill was highly regarded. Killing was not only moral it was celebrated.A benevolent morality is not especially the norm. Group success and survival will be the guiding principles dictating the moral structure of society.

            There appears to be a proscribed set of group rules, adherence to which allows you inclusion in that group. Adherence to same or a pretense of adherence in order to be included is necessary, depending on how much sh%t you can swallow. Unbelievers and new messiahs could be literally stoned from the village for upsetting the status quo. Questioning the local shaman’s ability to heal, or questioning why Vol has to be appeased will get you killed. Perhaps that’s the reason the bear went over the mountain.

        have to disagree with your thesis.  the next step after extended family groups was tribes, and after that towns, then cities, then empires.  primitive concepts of ‘gods’ were very different than the modern view (from antiquity through present day) and did not really impact the behavior of primitive humans.
take the stone age native americans as an example; how does your theory on religion “fit” there?

                Largely the case amongst native north american language groups, as well. Some were peaceful, typically those having resource-rich environments, like the Ohlone around S.F. Bay. Heck you can still see their shell mounds. No need to rob ‘n raid when you live in Little Eden.Most others, however, were extremely loyal to their tribe and considered all others to be — as you say — fair game. Not really human beings, in fact. As for human sacrifice on the continent, it certainly was not restricted to Mesoamerica.Stealing food, horses, and women/children for slaves? . . . oh yeah baby all good. A favorite pastime. Torturing and murdering? Check. Often the diversion of torture went to the women, as they were typically more cruel than the men. Comanche and Apache women terrified the early settlers.

                    Great comment.  Every war/conflict I’ve spent much time reading about inevitably includes blood curdling tales of females inflicting creatively horrible pain on their victims.  Heck, one of the most grizzly came from the journal of a civilian sailor who penetrated deep into Papua New Guinea.  The women could keep a captive alive for days tied to a post, while cutting off fresh slabs of long-pork for each meal.   They staunched the wounds with banana leaves as I recall…
If you end up in a shooting war against women, do not be taken alive.

                I was always amazed by the Aztecs behavior as they were relatively an advanced society wrt IQ at the time.  They engineered large structures, had mathematics and astrological observatories.  Yet on weekends for fun would tear the beating hearts out of thousands of captives upon those temples they designed and according to astronomical charts they devised.
That really was an object lesson for me on civilization and its moral shortcomings.

                    The default setting for human spirituality is human sacrifice/blood-fertility rites. Each culture calls it something different, but the historical record is what it is.
In the modern West, abortion and war satisfy this urge. Chiefly abortion because in the ancient world likewise, the more innocent the sacrifice, the more potent to produce rain. crops, etc.
The default setting is not Christianity, or even Buddhism.

        The Jews already have a solution to the universal morality issue; Noahide Laws.  They’ve been looking to impose these on Gentiles for quite a while.  Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson was promoting Noahide law back in the 90’s when they created Education Day USA.  You know, the guy who’s tomb was visited by Trump (and his handler Ben Shapiro lol) before the election.

            Impose the Noahide laws on gentiles?At least as far as Christianity goes, I’d say the first 5 laws are already established and the last two firmly entrenched through interpretation of Christian doctrine:”The seven Noahide laws are as follows:1. Do not worship idols: Prohibits idolatry or the worship of false gods.2. Do not blaspheme: Forbids disrespect or blasphemy against God.3. Do not murder: Prohibits the unjust taking of human life.4. Do not engage in illicit sexual relations: Forbids adultery, incest, and other prohibited sexual relationships.5. Do not steal: Prohibits theft and deceit.6. Do not eat flesh taken from a living animal: Forbids cruelty to animals and eating meat removed from a living creature.7. Establish courts of justice: Requires societies to establish a legal system to uphold justice and enforce the laws.”

                The Ten Commandments already cover most of the Noahide Laws, true, but my point is these are meant to apply to us, not them.  You can go through the Talmud and find the passages that exonerate the Jew when he transgresses against a Gentile, especially related to 3, 4 &amp; 5.  I wonder if the Courts of Justice mentioned in 7 will be under the jurisdiction of the Sanhedrin…

        I think guilt is instinctual.My cat, even though he was fixed, used to like to hump my dirty clothes and the bed comforters. Anytime I went upstairs and caught him, he immediately released the garment and started licking his private areas. The reaction reminded me as if your parents caught you playing with yourself at home. Call it what you want, but to me it seemed like the very human reaction of being embarrassed whenever I caught him.I mean, this is a stupid cat with a brain the size of a walnut. (He was actually very bright for his species.) And he was wired to be embarrassed when caught humping my clothing. Nobody taught him to have shame.So I’m inclined to believe we are wired that way.(By the way, for those who don’t know, this is rather common behavior with cats.)

                Oh yeah, like dogs have never been known to try to hump their masters legs. LOL. Cats are cool when you get used to their idiosyncrasies. Plus, they are pickier so when they like you, it feels more special.

        “…can the cancer be put into remission or must it be removed?”If your cancer analogy is to hold and be responded to, then *yes* the cancer must be removed whenever possible.  Cancer in remission always comes with a warning, indeed an understanding, that it may very well return.  Even when I had one exorcised, no physician said I was cancer free, but only responded with the 5 year wait and see response.To directly respond to your question, (true) zealots are not reoriented, but only suppressed.  I find support for such in that I consider these zealots to be what Woodley termed, “Spiteful Mutants”.  As such they cannot be “reoriented” or cured.  Only eliminated.  My caveat of course is that not all these folk are true zealots/mutants, many are simply “wannabes” acting a role to gain status.  Sorting who’s who is the problem.

        Yes, but if you read Hobbes’Leviathanyou find that about a third of it is reasoning based on analysis of Biblical quotations.
In other words, humans use reason to justify their passions and their beliefs about life, the universe, everything..
Also, I believe that animals can feel shame. Just tell a dog “Bad Dog” in an angry tone and you will see.

        Oh man.  Finally read the article beyond the first paragraph.This one goes in the Best of the Best file, for sure.This illustrates why I rail against the One God philosophy: it disrespects Creation’s iron law that there must be diversity, as nothing is static.As each people are expressed in different phenotype, and phenotype (observable differences) expresses genotype (genetic differences), each people is a different frequency channel on the big radio, each people has different gods.To try to pretend otherwise is to say AM picks up FM signals.To observe each to their own is the simple respect of seeing each as who they are, to read the history that made them mapped in their faces.The One God concept was demanded by would-be racial conquerors.The neopagans, like the pre-Colombian primitives before them, have re-introduced paleolithic belief in nothing  beyond themselves and their environment.The universalists try to accomodate both with rules that can’t contain the tail ends.This is why Islam would conquer today’s Europe.  Men conquer women, and those coordinated by religion conquer the disparate primitives they encounter.

        “…that is the point of the Genesis story of Adam and Eve. Shame and guilt were not natural to men until introduced by devilish forces.”LOL. Nah. They blamed white people for the end of the world, which is what happened in 2204 BC. That’s what baked it into the cake. The problem is, they also envied our mighty cities, and wanted our women so they could become us.True, though, the small hats who wrote the story have no guilt, or shame.Because from their point of view, they aren’t replacing us with themselves- they are saving the world.From US…because we brought the wrath of the gods. Twice!
