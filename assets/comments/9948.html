        What I like about the senior Libertarians is their developing and championing Great Books education, and not just the readings of the West.
In contrast, I read an article recently about how a prog school in NY is getting rid of ALL books.

        I once went to The Karl Marx House in Trier, Germany. It’s where Marx was born and is now a museum. It is great fun eavesdropping on the loonies when one goes there.

        ‘Who lead to Marx_?’, is an excellent (and highly original) organizing principle for understanding renaissance philosophers.  If you tweak the question slightly as, ‘Who lead to Marxism_?”, you really cannot leave out Machiavelli as an influential renaissance thinker as well.Machiavelli has unjustly been slanged as simply saying nothing but ‘The end justifies the means.’.  This certainly has historically been the ultimate operative principle of Communism and Cultural Marxism.  But Machiavelli did edge right up to that idea in the case that if the project were great enough: For him the unification of Renaissance Italy so as to end the disorders oh his time and the foreign predation they enabled.  IIRC, the key difference was that Machiavelli looked to work with mankind as he found it, i.e. fallen, and not suppose he or any else could remake human nature.Trouble is, the utopian transformation of all society is so obviously a far greater end that restoring Italy to Roman days that ‘practical Marxists’ (as big an oxymoron as is possible) used Machiavelli and the others you mention as intellectual cover.  Stripped of philosophical cover, ‘The end justifies the means.’, is just the same old ugly despotism from time immemorial.

        The no-name U I graduated from in the early ’50s required ancient and modern philosophy survey courses the first two years. They were tough, flunking out about as many as inorganic chem and calculus did. Modern focused on Locke, Kant and Hume. I took to it like a duck takes to water, and believe the principles I picked up were a big help dealing with life the next 65 years.

        A quibble: John Locke is not responsible for trannies in the bathroom or female Marines. To the contrary, the postmodern, feminist tendency to allow emotion-driven political correctness to override Lockean empiricism is what is responsible for trannies in the bathroom and female Marines.Witness the cognitive dissonance on display when a hip, modern, feminist mom in LA confronts the logical end game of the social policies for which her ilk have agitated for years:http://www.thegetrealmom.com/blog/womensrestroomAfter a couple paragraphs of the obligatory virtue signaling about how much she loves trannies, she hits her Key Quote: “If this had been 5 years ago, you bet your ass every woman in there would’ve been like, “Ummm what are you doing in here?”, but in 2017? The mood has shifted. We had been culturally bullied into silenced.”Two weeks later she issues the obligatory mea culpa, still professing that she’s fine with trannies in the ladies room but that “It’s simple: men should not be in the women’s restroom.”http://www.thegetrealmom.com/blog/viralblogComplete and utter lack of self awareness and ability to reason. You brought this shit on yourself, honey. Locke would bitch-slap her.Similarly, witness what the postmodern feminists did to Jim Webb, who in 1979 wrote a VERY Lockean paper arguing that women don’t belong in combat.http://freebeacon.com/blog/what-the-jim-webb-debacle-in-annapolis-is-teaching-the-military/

        Algernon Sidney’s Discourses Concerning Government is a one volume education in application of criticism to ideas about government. I’d put him alongside Montesquieu. A contemporary of Harrington’s and much more well-read. Harrington was smart enough to see that because Venice was the longest surviving republic in the history of the world, something must be of value in studying and possibly imitating her. Unfortunately, he comes across as a prototype of distributivism.An aside regarding a possible influence by Harrington, I think our Hamilton must have read him, although I know of no direct references made by him. But when you read the description of Hamilton’s speech promoting the idea that the chief executive serve for life under good behavior, an echo of the term of the Venetian Doge, you see a bit of Harrington.I think even a bad president can be made into a mediocre one if we had the same policy. The incentives are entirely different. If you wonder why it was traditional for the newly named Doge to be carried around St. Mark’s Square in a litter throwing gold coins around to the crowd, it was not a statement of his generosity. Those guys were basically saying that money didn’t mean anything to them any more.

            I think you are correct and I thought about including Sidney, but I was running a little long so dropped him. Plus, I was trying to stick with the proto-Marxist theme and I seem to recall the Marx never mentioned Sidney as an influence. I may be wrong on that point. I’m going to take a few stabs at this same body of knowledge from different angles so I’ll include Sidney at some point.
I’m fond of the idea of approaching this stuff with a purpose, like learning the writers who influence Marx or the Founders.

                I can’t remember Marx referring to Sidney, either. If so, perhaps it was because Sidney was so good at deconstructing political notions that Marx thought it best not to encourage the habit.As far as classical economics goes, Thomas Sowell wrote a book covering his thoughts on all of them and included Marx as the last of the classical economists. Nice little volume.If anyone does not want to wade through thousands of pages on Marx, my favorite Marx scholar is Robert Tucker. He wrote several books on Marx and all are very readable and without the residue of the misconceptions brought about by anachronistic treatments of the evolution of the theory by him and Engels.

        Oh, Z, you and your commenters are amazingly well read and cogent writers. This article is fascinating and, ashamed I am to admit it, over my head. Or to place the onus where it belongs, on me, reading your work here, I am out of my depth.Strangely, coincidently, I clicked here immediately after having read Patrick J Deneen’s article at First Things, ‘Against Great Books: Questioning Our Approach to the Western Canon.’https://www.firstthings.com/article/2013/01/against-great-booksThe two essays dovetail slightly, and read well together. Although Deneen looks closely at content in order to frame the larger picture of reading the canon to promote cultural, civil, virtue rather than to evaluate and closely compare the content.

                        If you really think about it there are no real libertarians.  Even this dude, who promoted the idea of civil disobedience, was against religious toleration in France because he thought it would weaken the crown. In other words, he had his ideas, which are mere abstractions, and his way of life, which was practical.You might say that I espouse some libertarian ideas when I propose things like abolition of medical licensing, but I do so seeing that as a transition to something else. Getting rid of licensing doesn’t eliminate controls completely, it simply changes where the focus of control is. The abolition of licensing is a transition. The level of control moves to more local levels, and allows for a diversity of solutions to the problems of scarcity in both materia medica, as well as in who a provider actually is. Licensing and accreditation is a one size fits all solution. It’s like telling everyone they have to use an Apple computer, and Tim Cook is president of the AMA (he might be for all we know–yep, not a member, have never paid dues to the group that the government gave a monopoly to).

        Context will also yield a dose of humility.There have been living things on Planet Earth for about 4 billion years; of which bacteria remain the most numerous. Every single human being has more bacteria cells on them and in them than they do the endemic cells of our species. We would not be alive without them.Complex language skill has only been with us for about 200,000 years, and higher order thinking for only about 50,000 years. Civilization began about 15,000 years ago and memetic evolution started in earnest only about 5 millennia ago. The Renaissance is about 500 years old, and likely has reached hyper-speed only during the past 50 years.The experiment has only just begun.

        thezman:
1. Could you make Part X a summary post, with one essential book recommendation from each previous part? Hell, I’m still not done with part one books! It’s getting out of hand, you are becoming like Moldbug, who didn’t link to anything but full books.
2.This favicon is much more stylish than the current one:http://thezman.com/favicon.ico
It was displayed when the site wasn’t redirecting, that’s how i found it.
3. Will the classic commenting system remain? I hope so.
I even added point 3 via the 5 min edit/fix feature!

            Yeah, everyone seems to like the old comment system better so I’m just going to leave it, unless I’m wrong about public opinion.
I’m working on a major revamp of the site to roll out in a month or two. Post editing is going to be a requirement hence forth. Too easy to make a mistake and you have to be able to edit them.

        Agree with all of that.
One, pedantic point: Thomas More (one’O’) was a lawyer, not a priest. Living twenty yards away from the site of his home makes me feel I have an interest in his memory.
