        The Zman criticizes the natalist and trad movements for “overdoing it” and seeming like an “obsession” and says that they are the mirror of the left’s obsession with single women.Well, let’s slow down and think about that.The left’s obsession with single women has beenveryeffective. Devastatingly effective, such that most of the mainstream right accepts the left’s framing on the role of women in society. The right is notorious for embracing strong, independent women with careers, like the childless Ann Coulter.So if a tactic has been very effective, maybe it is a good tactic. Maybe we could use a strong “obsessive” natalist movement flooding the culture.

            Downvote from some anti-natalist fag. If you’ve got something to say, come out and say it.

                Not from me. I have two childless unmarried twin sisters, 48 years old, who’ve lived together their entire lives. They’re insane and I expect that once our mother dies, they will either kill each other, me, or a random stranger.
Our societal madness is due — and we all know this, I’m repeating a cliche here — to childless post-menopausal women. They lack natural completion and they are destroying society in their inchoate, unconscious, murderous rage.

                    Abortion has also sent them over the edge.imagine having to live with yourself knowing you killed your own baby.  How does anyone truly recover from that?  I have told this story before, but my wife had a miscarriage and to this day it haunts her.  I’ll hear her crying in her sleep.I know that kids are something like an appendage. You feel their sicknesses and their pains like you would in your own extremity. It’s there.  And I’m a guy so I can only imagine how it affects a mom if she went off and killed her own offspring.  The amount of inner turmoil cannot be dealt with through normal means and so it finds expression in some type of vengeful lunacy.and transfer this over to transsexuals while we’re at it.  Imagine cutting off your own dick.  For a man, perhaps his best friend.  Or maybe that his dog. But it’s close. The point is that inner turmoil cannot be resolved through normal means.  Our bodies aren’t set up to deal with issues like self mutilation.  Asking them to is another form of self abuse.

                        Perhaps the sort of woman who kills her own baby doesn’t have a conscience to begin with and therefore feels no lingering remorse. I suspect this is the case with most of them, anyway. And if you’ve observed, first-hand as I have, the typical sheboon’s lack of maternal love for her children, you’ll know what I’m talking about.

                            Sheboons care about their kids in their own way, notwithstanig what strikes me as unnecessarily brutal slaps in the head I see them giving their kids in the grocery aisles.  But that’s a thick skull with but an advanced reptile brain, and they know what’s best and what works for their own kind and kin.
or to disagree, a sheboon feels at least some inner discord if she kills her kid.  You cannot fool Mother Nature.  Kill your kid, sheboon or not, and Mother will pay you back in some way.  No one escapes.

                            I don’t think it works that way
because a culture of death seeps into every social circle
if blacks are doing it, whites are doing it too.  No way to separate them fully. We are all living in the same boat for better or for worse and what happens in the black area travels into white area

                                Yes, but it’s liberal whites and non liberals who have a defective kid. Liberal whites aborting something that shouldn’t have been created in the first place, whether outside marriage or whether they were wanting to sow their oats with a diversity. I’m not going to knock somebody for aborting a defective kid.I’m just being a realist here. These are real decisions people have to make.I was just reading about Sally Field and how her mom and stepdad took her to Mexico for an abortion after she got impregnated by her high school boyfriend. She seems like she had issues herself, so she probably did society a favor.

                                Yes. This right here is a cardinal point. Too many white guys in my age group assume this is just a black problem. Meanwhile their wives had abortions without them ever knowing while they were off for a week with the guys to watch European soccer in the UK.
It’s the entire culture and has been for a long time. Even in the mid-90s white women were already corrupt; the women in my college dorm had no morals, but paid lip service only to societal norms (now long gone, releasing them from the performance of Christian actions without enthusiasm).

                                    White women certainly are into abortion, but almost as bad for our society is that they’re the one who refuse to have kids in the first place.

                                I personally wish we could go back to the time where women kept their legs together until marriage. Since you’re never going to put that genie back in the bottle, abortion might be a necessary evil.

                                    We’re slowly realising that maybe the “patriarchy” and belief in God were there for a purpose. Even a semi-anarchist like me can see that for a society to survive and prosper, you need some pretty strict moral rules.

                        I think many women seem to have no trouble with abortion, because society tells them it’s not only fine but is also highly empowering.

            Shaming is aVERYeffective tactic with women. BUT, the shaming has to come from other women.My late mother-in-law, a Silent Generation, told me that when she was growing up, a person wasn’t considered an adult unless 1) they were married and 2) they had started a family. There was a lot of peer pressure, especially female peer pressure, on women to “Get with the program”. The stereotype of mom with her arms crossed, tapping her feet and pointing out to her daughter “I don’t see any grandbabies around here! What’s taking so long?” didn’t come out of nowhere.Women are now lauded and shamed the other direction: Their mothers, grandmothers, etc. tell them “We didn’t fight for the right to work and earn our own money for you to throw it away as a stay at home mom!” Note how in a group of middle class or higher women today any woman that says she’s a stay at home mother gets addressed as “Justa housewife.” 😒 What, give up a career?!?Womens is Stronk! Indypendent! They don’t Need No Man!!!!!! 💪‘Till the baby rabies hit. 😏I’ve pointed out at Sev’s site for this to work, you’d need a sea change in women’s attitudes towards marriage and family. Forget the economic issues facing younger adults for a moment, other women would need to play up being a mother and wife was a better deal by far than 35 years old, single, and no prospects on the horizon.But would women do that?

                Women won’t do that until they come to self realization of what their natural role and path to happiness is.  Most I believe *do* come to that, but by that time it’s too late for having children.  Hence we have generations of lonely, neurotic, and depressed women among us.

                    Compsci:  And self-proclaimed tradcons exacerbate the problem by raising either entitled princesses, or insisting their daughters have a backup professional career “just in case.”  If women have financial self-sufficiency, they will live frivolously and put off marriage and motherhood indefinitely.  They search for the ultimate alpha male, who is ‘x’ tall or makes ‘x’ per year, and then use reproductive technology to have perhaps one child.  All the while splitting time with their ‘career’ and doing a piss-poor job at both career and family.

                        Ouch.  I confess my fault in that as well.  Daughter just had her (perhaps) one and done in her 30’s—but damn, she’s got a great looking diploma from Stanford on the wall.
As should be obvious to all here, I only grew up when I hit my 60’s.  Too late for me, but perhaps others can learn.  As I’ve been told:  “We all serve as ‘good examples’—even if only a good example of a ‘bad example’”.  Sigh.

                            I don’t have kids, but if I had a daughter, I would stress both. I would want them to have an education and be able to think things through on her own. Besides, if you are some nitwit, it’s going to be tough to hold the interest of a man who is anywhere into the triple digits of IQ. That doesn’t necessarily mean you need a degree, but I’m all for that anyway.My other half got her Master’s Degree 5 years ago had some overpriced big name private university. I told her to go to the state school because it would be a lot cheaper. She went ahead and got her degree and I’m glad she did it. She has a sense of pride and accomplishment if nothing else.

                                TempNick:  Don’t confuse credentials with education.  I never said men should marry stupid women – and many of the stupidest have advanced degrees.  The standard trope is the man pissing away money on beer and cigarettes while the kids go hungry.  The reality is women pissing away money on hair, nails, and show tickets while feeding their kids poisonous fast food.

                                    I completely agree with that. I know that there are a lot of smart people who don’t have the credentials. However, if you play the odds, you’re more likely to get intelligence with the credential. I just think it’s good for you as a person. I don’t really care about anything I learned in school, it’s the thinking process that you’re trained in that has yielded dividends for me. School can give you self-confidence that you’re not a dummy and that you can do these kinds of things.

Folks, what’s with this statement and your attending down votes?
I’ve *just* finished chapter 12—“Is Critical Thinking a Better Model of Intelligence? ​◈​ Diane F. Halpern &amp; Heather A. Butler—in “The Nature of Human Intelligence” by Sternberg.
There’s a whole school of thought and published study  supporting what this man, TempoNick,  has discovered for himself.  Kudos.   😉

                                                        I feel you brother. I just had a friend over tonight who I haven’t seen in a good while. A truly good person who would do anything for you, and did when the anti-white racist police decided to make an example out of me a while back, he helped me out tremendously.He is black. And like your tribal friend, at the end of the day, I would wish him well and send him on his merry way with his own people probably as you’d do with your friend.This is what lefties do not get. Most of us just want freedom of association but they push so hard that they turn the ‘leave me alone’ crowd into the fedpoasting crowd because they simply do not know when to quit.I have multiple black friends because, hello! I lived in DC most of my life, but at the end of the day I would send every single one of them packing if someone offered an amicable split of this nation along racial lines. I would not think twice or hesitate once about this.

Depends on what you’re studying. Mathematics, philosophy-yes. Psychology, sociology-not so much.
It’s as the difference between teaching one how to think v. what to think.

                                    I would add: never confuse credentials or education with g intelligence. A person may be educated on the particulars of an individual sequoia yet be daftly ignorant as to the rest of the forest right in front of them.
Currently, I am attempting to author comparable sage advisement regarding a simple jingle associated with Chicago. The reality is my intelligence, credentials and education are rather underutilized at the moment even assuming I have them. We don’t even use the best we can do often.

                                No disagreement.  My wife is “smarter” than me (documented via testing) and holds three degrees.  She worked, as I did, because—well that’s what you do, don’t want to stay at home as her mom did…. In any event, we punched out two children and shortchanged them via our career.  And for over educated (degreed?) academic types we had it pretty good since we didn’t punch a time clock.  I can imagine what other folk have to do to fit children into their life with a career/employment outside of the home.So now we sit at home retired, and what is her greatest regret—“I should have had more children”.  She/we see our children as following down the same family vs career as we modeled for them in their childhood.  And I guess such regret is richly deserved.  Something about “karma” comes to mind here.

                                    Compsci:  My husband asked me to tell you that he admires your humility.  My husband was worried about affording more kids and how to send them to college.  Now he says we ought to have had the 3-4 we initially discussedregardless,rather than just the two we have.  It’s one of many reasons we help our sons financially – so they don’t have those later regrets.

I have irrefutable proof I am smarter than my wife: Look at who I  married and look at who she married…

                            Compsci:  I seriously considered tossing all my ‘certificates’ (framed and unframed) when we were packing to move.  In the end I tossed them in a box and they’re in the basement of my son’s house.  I don’t ever plan on displaying them, but maybe they will be quaint artifacts or curiosities to my grandkids.  At the very least they can be used as fire starters.

                            I have daughters too, Compsci. We all want to do our best by them, but it’s hard when you’re fighting the whole of society. My girls are both strong and independent (in the old sense). This is great because it means they didn’t believe any of the BS about Covid and see through all the LGBTQWERTY crap too. However, it does mean that they want jobs or occupations that are interesting and challenging. I suspect they will both marry and have kids later on, but it’s not a done deal. We do what we can!

                    Don’t forget about the men.  A lot of men are opting out of marriage and fatherhood because it is just so risky.  When I was in my late teens early 20s, which was nearly 35 years ago, I knew a bunch of guys in their late 20s early 30s.  Every single one of them had horror stories of divorce court, family court or getting arrested at work for child support payments.  The ones going through divorce were losing their homes, their children and a large part of their income.  Things have really only gotten worse since then.I don’t want to be that guy, but is playing video games really any worse than starting a life and then having ripped from you and becoming an ATM machine for the next 15 years?

                                There are things we could do to make the process less risky. Perhaps young men could join some kind of mannerbund that would offer “slut insurance”. Basically, if/when the little princess decides to “find herself” chasing exotic dicks and plans to use a guy’s money to do it the mannerbund steps in with legal help and moral support. Perhaps guys could give their wealth to the mannerbund itself if it looked like the slut was going to get it all. Maybe a trust fund can be set up to allow him some use of the money in a way that’s protected from the courts. This is pure brainstorming. I have no idea if this is possible or where it would/would not be legal.

                                I still argue and still get lambasted for my position on “good” men finding “good” women.  If men learn what’s important in finding a good women—what to look for, where to find—the odds of success in marriage increases tremendously.I admit that we, as a society, have lost many institutions we once depended upon to help find a mate.  But really guys (and girls), do you think hitting the bars or searching through “Tinder” is the best place to find wife/husband and mother material?  Is that “hot”, tatted-up, “7-9” THOT (you’ve never seen a 10, trust me) at the table over there your soul mate or a one night stand?  And if you are looking for one night stands in those places, you get what you deserve, but it won’t be a life partner.I first met my future wife who was then a server in a small lunch time, food serving cafeteria-style restaurant.  I and a friend would visit to drink coffee and read.  At the urging of my friend—everyone needs a friend to goad him on—I asked for her phone number as she dished up a sandwich, then paid the cashier at the end of the line and sat down wondering what next.  Well next was, as I quickly learned from that first phone call, a sit down with the parents, then the “date” could begin.  That’s a “tell” of sorts.  😉We’ve been together from then on—50 years.  And yes, we did go to night clubs and dive bars in our early years, but as man and wife.

                                    I think you get lambasted for not realizing that’s it’s a totally different society than the one you were raised in…So that diner with the wholesome girl is few and far between…The opportunities are just way less for both sexes these days…It’s like when people your age say you just have to work harder or young people are lazy…

                                        I agree, but does that make Tinder or bar hopping or one night stands a correct or acceptable replacement in the present era?Woman have learned (men to, but I have less respect for them) that the “one night stand” is the modern replacement for the “good night kiss”.Let’s bring the time somewhat into the present.  I remember my son was going out with his future wife (not known at that time however).  We were outside in the garage and I noticed he was acting a bit “hinky” considering his going out that night with her.It all of a sudden hit me that he was probably “getting some”.  The conversation stopped and I simply stared at him and said, “I don’t know what’s gotten into you, but if I ever hear of you disrespecting that girl you won’t be living here anymore”.He turned white and never said another word, but the point was made—which was you’d better be as serious as she is.  He was, he proposed during college and they later married.I’m not naive, who waits for marriage these days, but you don’t go bed hopping—even I knew that and made the point explicitly as I could.

                        This^^^.  I got married late, and admittedly a lot of it had to do with this exact thing.  I’ve done well for myself, and I wasn’t going to hand it all over to some rotten bitch who wanted someone to take care of her.My wife and I met too late to have children, and even if we could, there is zero chance I would want to bring a White child into this God forsaken hellscape of a world we live in.  I do not find my marriage to be pointless because my wife and I love each other deeply and I could not imagine my life without her.  That being said, nothing will change for the better because “progress”.  My wife actually agrees with me that a big part of the mess the west has become is because of feminization of everything.  Women in the workplace being a big one.  My wife works with a bunch of other women, and the drama they create is unbearable and she finds herself saying to me, “I see exactly what you mean”.None of this matters though because we aren’t ever returning to 1950 “America”.  To speak of women the way Harrison Buttker did will only get you thrown into the void and your life destroyed.  It will only be a matter of time before he is cancelled too.  He is just in the unique situation where he’s made enough money to live.

                        I’m one of them.
I’ve been pretty much MGTOW since I was thirteen because I’ve always had a minimal sex drive which afforded me a clarity that my male peers didn’t have. I saw the direction in which our women and our culture were rapidly headed. My best friend is a woman and our platonic relationship more than suffices.
And yeah, bringing kids into the world as it is now is insane.

                As a boomer, my ex and I got a lot of pressure to get married as a couple graduating from college. Everyone we knew was doing it. That doesn’t appear to be a thing anymore.

                    Not to be a broken record, but I’ve told the story of back when I was in kollege gettin’ me some knowledge, exactly one couple I knew got married while undergrads. And clueless me asked the gal if they “had” 👶 to get married when they announced their engagement. Kudos to the young lady who should’ve belted me five across the chops, but she explained they were in love and why wait until graduation?Most college women were like my first college roommate’s girlfriend who told us, somewhat verbatim, “Hey! I didn’t go to college to get married! I’m gonna get a job and my own money and parrrrrr-tay!”And this was in the Reagan / Daddy Bush era. Women getting MRS. degrees? Back then it was to laugh. It probably hasn’t gotten any better, and is probably worse today.

                As a woman, I can shame other women all day. If the men won’t back it up, I’m sunk. I don’t have the natural authority in any conversation.I can tap my feet (and snap my fingers) about wanting grandbabies. If Dad is saying “Go get a good job and support your husband”, nothing I can say will overcome that.Gentleman, have daughters and encourage them to be another man’s faithful wife, rather than sportsball heroes and engineers. Women react to and cultivate culture of men, they cannot create a positive one by themselves.

                    Agreed it has to come from both sexes (I believe in only two, terrorist that I am), but women forget their “subtle” power. There’s a funny but true line inMy Big Fat Greek WeddingToula Portokalos: Ma, Dad is so stubborn. What he says goes. “Ah, the man is the head of the house!”Maria Portokalos: Let me tell you something, Toula. The man is the head, but the woman is the neck. And she can turn the head any way she wants.You’re right that screaming at each other like drill sergeants is counter-productive. But aren’t you women the masters of giving a man an idea and making him think it’s his? Power behind the throne and all that.Just don’t be Lady MacBeth. 😏

                Men have to take the lead.  Women aren’t going to come to these conclusions on their own.  Or if they do they will not act on them on their own.I think much of this is a lost art.  Men getting women to do their bidding is something of a lost art.  Work with women into realizing that having a family is what’s best for her.I remember a long time ago there was a male coach of a very successful woman’s college basketball team. He was asked to explain the biggest difference between coaching men and coaching women.  He said with men, you tell them what to do and they do it.  With women, you have to explain why doing something is what is best for her and the team.im sure there a lot of truth in that.  Men need to take time with women and work them.  Be persistent but not annoying.  We all have it in us.  It’s a lost art we need to recover from its lack of use and put it to good use.

                    I still think it needs to be both sides. A woman’s peers are important in shaping her behaviors, same as it is for men. If she’s hanging out with her gal pals who want to party, dance, and pick up strange guys, marriage ain’t happening.Also, Dalrock the blogger (miss him) had a great point on how women look to other women in their social group for “The Signal”. One gal in the group gets engaged, suddenly all the other men get pressure to “put a ring on it”. Sadly, he pointed out, it goes the other direction: One gal decides to get divorced, it comes in waves to other husbands in her circle.Food for thought. Not disagreeing about men needing to step up too.

                        It’s going to take a team effort is the reality of it. Church may also need to play a major role.  But perhaps starting small with a few guys taking the lead and their women setting the stage for other women to follow.  Hopefully it builds momentumI know in my life because we had our first kid when I was only 18 going on 19, and I was sort of ostracized from the upper middle class world I was reared in, but lots of blue collar guys took inspiration from me.  My actual peers, many of them never had kids at all, and now we’re all in our late 50s.  They look on me now like I’m a genius. And they envy me. And I’m done with kids. Did my job.  Now I’m seeing guys in their 40s or 50s raising toddlers.  Don’t know how they do it. I’m glad I got my job over with while I was still strong and loaded with vitality.kids imitate their parents. I was not perfect and lots of things I wish I could do over, but my first son was raised by a young man with all of his strength intact, a young tiger learning as I went. It made him stronger because he had to compete against me.  It was a nice even match.  We are probably the best of friends today, and we both love nothing more than competing against each other in a game of tennis. Our true love.point being, it should come as no surprise that young girls, beautiful and yet to fully ripen, are out there discussing among themselves whether they should get some type of plastic surgical work.  Because they may only be 17 or 19 or 20 but they imitate their moms who are wrinkled old hags if not for the surgeries and the Botox and so forth.moral of the story ladies: take it from me, you want to have your first kid in your early twenties, maybe late since people are taking longer to mature with the life expectancy being extended so everything slows down.  But if life expectancy goes down, as it seems to be, the old rules will apply again. .

                        mmack: ‘Also, Dalrock the blogger (miss him) had a great point on how women look to other women in their social group for “The Signal”.’Our existential quandary is that the Frankfurt School &amp; the Council of the Sanhedrin hijacked &amp; perverted &amp; poisoned “The Signal” via Feminism, Talmudvision, j00vies, Scrotial Media, and of course post-secondary edumakashun [all of which the Frankfurters &amp; the Sanhedrin control absolutely, at this point effectively without any intellectual nor moral nor spiritual competition whatsoever].There do exist women who have the natural ability to see through the incessant omnipresent cultural conditioning, but apparently those women are rarer than hens’ teeth.I have long been proclaiming that a true innate inner moral compass [which understands without any doubt whatsoever the difference between right &amp; wrong] is the rarest of all known qualities in White*** females.And, by the way, those exceptionally rare moral White females will almost certainly come from Marriage Famblies [NOT FROM DIVORCE FAMBLIES!!!].===============***Other than j00esses, I don’t know diddly squat about females from other races, although I have been informed, in no uncertain terms, that Chinese bishes have cash registers for souls.

                The default position today is to label this shaming as oppression and bigotry. However, as you say, it existed for a reason. Take the issue of babies born outside of marriage. Today this is no biggy; in fact, it’s even considered cool. Way back when, illegitimate babies placed an enormous and often fatal burden on communities, many of which were struggling to survive economically. Illegitimate babies are still a socially destructive phenomenon today, causing massive knock-on social problems. The difference is that the immediate effects are hidden because the welfare state picks up the tab. Further down the line, this is going to be a massive problem. We’re going to end up with a large number of boys who have no positive male role model and who despise women. Nice one, libs!

            While it is true that the anti-natalist, girl-boss, spinster idea has caught on, it may have more to do with broader causes of low fertility discussed in the podcast. The anti-fertility cultural themes might just be another consequence of these other factors rather than the cause of low TFR.

            Had my first child at 61.  Many factors contributed — boomer culture (me-me-me etc), demanding profession, lack of understanding of white female craziness post-feminism et cetera.  Woke up in late 50s and realized, gasp, I was finite and that when I got shoveled in, everything I did, know and remembered would go in with me.
Late middle 60s now …. thinking hard about going for #2.
Never a moment’s regret.

Explain that you’re a smart older accomplished guy that wants to have a baby.  Trust me they will knock down your door. Get busy Z. Hell you have a house in the mountains.  They’ll like that too.

                    Late reply … you know, I don’t know what to say.  I made a mess of things previously … in the marriage and family department.  Poor selection, not understand myself, not understanding just how different women were / are, having been socially-poisoned by the the beliefs and expectations of the popular and intellectual cultures of the post-war  world in this country — caused me great confusion and lack of success.  Poor male role model in my family did not help.Add to that now that American females have turned into nightmare creatures; males in many cases to disgusting caricatures of traditional masculinity.  I will acknowledge that I contributed heavily to the earlier lack of marital success through my own behavior — it wasn’t all on the spouses. For instance, my first wife wanted kids.  She came from a large family, and wanted to see three to five scrubbed little kid faces around the kitchen table every meal. I was busy with a demanding profession, and did not give them to her — Mistake. This was in the 80s.So I can’t give any good advice, just a cautionary tale.But I did recognize my error, and when opportunity presented itself, I acted.

            The most effective lie from the government and media especially is that you need a solid job or career in motion before you can raise and have kids
the truth is a man doesn’t start making decent money UNTIL he has kids.  There’s no incentive or sense of urgency, and the doors just don’t open for you in the way they will when you have children.  Kids are like a good luck charm.

                Yep. We had my oldest right after I graduated from college and I was in a job that paid less than $30k.* Had the second three years later (up to five now). We were mostly a single income family. The wife cleaned a few houses on the side, but we homeschooled, so she kept to what was flexible and self-scheduled.Kids are not the financial burden they say. We also did home births, which don’t enrich the hospital industrial complex to the tune of many tens of thousands of dollars.*An inflation calculator is telling me that’s $80k today. Sigh. $30k (more like $26k actually right when we got married) wasn’t considered a big income even back then, but, yeah, slightly on the lower side of middle class. We did fine. We lived in a “mixed” neighborhood within our means in a house we bought with an FHA loan — not a lot down — for about $45k.The difference between now and then is that was a gorgeous 3 BR house with a big bedroom, family room, bathroom and basement addition in perfect condition for $45k. We recently bought a much smaller 2BR house in the same neighborhood for about $75k that needed another $25k in repair.I definitely wouldn’t have made the same life and career choices without the family. Responsibility makes men.

        On the subject of ignoring the threads informing the Covid origins, that insouciance among our citizens is incomprehensible.  Lives all across the planet were thrown into upheaval.  Ask your buddy sometime if they might be interested.  None of my acquaintances or family are, none.Then there’s 9/11.  Lower manhattan was destroyed, you can’t board a plane without obese black women, bursting out of their Homeland security uniforms, making your travel difficult.  But no one I know (in real life, IRL), cares to think or comment about it.In 1963, a popular President was murdered in the middle of Dallas, later televised.  Few people think about it today, wonder about the truth.There are so many more examples.  No babies?  Americans have reached true Idiocracy levels of moronism (yea, it’s a word).

            It’s not so much the things themselves, but the response to them that’s so telling. Visiting a U.S. city in the aftermath of 9/11, the public transport I was on couldn’t enter the station because someone had left a paper bag lying around. I remember thinking that people had gone completely nuts over someone’s lunch sack. Years later, the insanity really hit me as I shifted around during a transfer in Europe whilea moslempawed through my carry-on looking for dangerous items. Yep, the answer to Islamic terrorism perpetrated by Saudis who overstayed their tourist visas was to fill our countries with moslems.A novel cold virus escaped from the U.S.-funded research lab in China and everyone is supposed to wrap a rag around their face and avoid going to the office, a department store, or church. For some reason, residences, grocery stores (except for the non-food aisles) and BLM riots were deemed to be relatively safe. I guess the Covid boogie man didn’t know where the kids like to hide. Meanwhile, in the war zone of Ukraine we learn that the American regime continues to bankroll bioweapons labs in countries of dubious safety throughout the world.It’s often misremembered that Kennedy was not widely popular, especially in conservative parts of the country. This was not so much for what he did, but the break from tradition that he represented. Like Biden, his election victory may be attributed to remarkable success in a few key districts.The Dallas trip was meant to shore up support in Texas. Johnson and the Congress responded to his assassination by pushing through civil rights legislation and the 1965 Immigration Act. Apparently, opposition to certain political changes was to be met with measures to thoroughly smash the recalcitrants.

                I always remind our guys, the official story of JFK’s assassination isn’t that lone nut Lee Harvey Oswald killed him, but thatDallas—symbol of white reaction against civil rights, still “The Town That Killed Kennedy” in popular song—did it. Watch any documentary on the assassination, even revisionist ones. The deadly danger of Dallas™ is the frame the picture is hung in. And it always was, before Kennedy even got to town.Oswald was the brightest glowing fed of all time. His job, which you can credit to Mossad if you like, was to stage an assassination attempt that would be blamed on the right. But he accidentally made his shot, like an over-the-back half-court chuck that fluked into a swish—and the official Dallas™ narrativeproceeded anyway, just as the J6 “insurrection” story did in the absence of (wrongly anticipated) MAGA violence.And the remedy—America’s vengeance—was to smash the recalcitrants, as you note.

            One of the most striking features of postmodernity is the utterly ovine placidity of the masses. I use placidity instead of apathy because apathy at least implies awareness of the issues. Our fellow human beings don’t even seem to be aware that there ‘are’ any issues. They simply absorb society’s insufferable outrages, abuses and affronts with anesthetized torpor, reach for the Cheetos and Coors Lite, and shuffle around in aimless ovals as if nothing has even happened. The masses are a narcotized, unthinking herd. How they descended to this level so quickly is the question.

                    That explains the Leftist mores, but doesn’t explain the dullness to my satisfaction. Can public education and views broadcast through the pop culture and media really reduce the masses to a field of cabbages? I suspect digital technology has something to do with it.

                        Maybe genetics after all?I accidentally crossed religion in my 20s and learned a lot of positive ideas from it. It saved my life from a fate of despair and mental distress. Later abandoned it as religious institutions are also dull and unappealing. But now I see they were the shadow of a former saner state for humanity.But I do not see many people with the same issues. They seem happy with their entertainment and other slop and do not care about how the society that makes this high standard of living works or the needs of it being maintained for following generations. This is a society without a plan for the future.In my case after time to think about it I see many of the things that make me the way I am are probably genetic in nature. I did not choose to have an interest in moral issues and the spiritual need to care about the future of humanity. But I was a slop consumer for many years so I understand the sedating effect of it.People who just want to grill and watch sports or those who only want to binge the latest Netflix trends and me are not the same.

                            No, we’re certainly not the same. We are alienated from the countries and the masses they contain. I suppose we might be happier if we were assimilated to the Borg of Drones, but if it were even possible for me to do so, I would reject it.

                            The society does have a plan for the future. The problem is that it’s totally idiotic and based on utterly false premises. Ruling class intellectuals realized a long time ago that declining birth rates would eventually create a labor shortage and crash the value of real estate. Their solution? Well, it’s something we talk about here all the time. The solution was to import half of Latin America to swell the labor force and prop up housing values. This was based on the utterly simple minded notion that all human beings have the same effects on a society and economy. They looked at the many positive effects of the baby boom, lots of young strong workers doing needed tasks and then using the income to buy houses in the suburbs. They also knew their racial dogma – “all people everywhere are the same”, so they couldn’t imagine that millions of young third worlders would have a different effect than millions of young intelligent White people.And of course, even in economic terms, they miscalculated. Housing values were not only supported but skyrocketed leading to hopelessness and nihilism among the young. At the same time crucial types of skilled jobs are still unfilled with the shortage of skilled labor expected to get drastically worse as more of the older White workers retire. The proposed cure for this? Well, more of the same, of course! We just need more immigration – bigger, harder, uncut!I’m sure that some of the people advocating mass immigration knew it was a poor substitute for a hopeful, vigorous population producing adequate numbers of offspring and training them in useful professions. They certainly never voiced those concerns loudly enough though. What was always a bad bandaid became a permanent prosthetic. Now here we are getting groped at the airport by muslims whose cousins back home are actual terrorists and then flying in planes that fall apart in the air because providing jobs for immigrant halfwits is more important than air safety.

                        You may recall a Brit, trumpton, who once posted here. He had an interesting theory about the digital aspect. His theory stuck with me. As best I can explain it, he posited that through sequences, patterns and repetition, digital “mind worms” had been perfected to induce desired responses and reactions to propaganda. It wasn’t the propaganda was more polished and improved, but the delivery mechanism/method had been perfected. That struck me as likely true, at least in the sense of how the herd was being made either to stampede or go into the loading chute to a degree never seen before in history.

                            I’d be very interested in knowing the actual percentage of AINO’s adults who use drugs–not including alcohol–let’s say, at least once a week. I sense the percentage has never before been as high as it is now, but exactly how high–so to speak–is it? 10 percent? 75 percent? Somewhere in between?

        I think it’s being ignored by TPTB because most people like the idea of fewer people. I do. I think many of today’s problems – nanny state, resource allocation, widespread incompetence, conflict – can be attributed to the sheer mass of humanity everywhere.
Not that I support superbugs that cull the population. But overpopulation is one of those things that most people think about and shudder. Even the famously urban Chinese are relishing the thoughtabout their population halving.
Now the real problem iswhois still having babies, and it’s not high-IQ types…

            It doesn’t really matter if high IQ types aren’t having babies, for a couple of reasons. First, high IQ types aren’t guaranteed to give birth to geniuses. Genetic recession is a thing, and so are birth complications that cause brain injury.Second, having moderate IQs aren’t precluded from giving birth to geniuses, either, and often do. You can somewhat regularly get geniuses from non-genius stock.Third, a rigorous education can compensate, to a limited degree, for non-genius intelligence. IQ is basically processor speed. Knowledge is basically software. Simplified software can compensate for lower processor speed, and simplified education can compensate for average IQ.Finally, the need for genius is overrated. Most of the necessary work in society is menial, and that doesn’t require a high IQ. Lots of marginal improvements can be, and have been made, by people of average intelligence. Frankly, life experience makes for better decision-making than pure genius because experience has the benefit of practicality in a way that raw brainpower doesn’t.

                The IQ advantage of whites and east asians isn’t so much about the rare “geniuses,” it’s more about the average person having an IQ of roughly 100 as opposed to 80.

                    Not necessarily so.  Jeffery, you take the extremes to make your point.  However, the measurement/statistic you use—IQ—is a rank order measure, not interval.  This means simply we can’t state that the difference in intelligence between 100 and 105 IQ between two individuals, is the same as the difference between 120 and 125 IQ between two individuals.Same goes wrt populations.  What is considered mentally retarded and non-functional in a Western society seems to be acceptable—and functional—in many 3rd world societies.As I’ve referred to above, Dutton and others have attempted to study genius and the difference between more or less of them in a populace.  Dutton would disagree with you there.

                            No.  We simply don’t know.  Indeed, there is broad evidence that too much IQ, as it too high, creates genius of which no one can communicate with.
On the other hand, I specifically denied this using the example of an (low) IQ measure that in Western society is considered “retarded” and non-functional, yet the same calculated/estimated IQ, albeit low by Western standards, seems to produce a functional individual in other non-Western nations.  Africa comes to mind.

                    This is spot on. When the vast masses of a population have high cognitive abilities to be able to hold and act upon reasonably sophisticated civic/social abstractions. The same is true of the related attributes of low time preference and high impulse control. This frees the extreme outliers on the high end to unleash their genius and to have many people who couldn’t conceive the innovative breakthroughs to understand and do something useful with it.When we celebrate Christopher Columbus, we celebrate all of Europe whose IQ/impulse-control distribution was high enough to support a civilization capable of producing him as well as Drake, Magellan, deGama, Cortez, … … The same is true of the Cathedrals, the space program, the Romans, the Greeks, the scientific age … …It is the entire distribution curve that means we are all responsible for making what our ancestors achieved possible. Anyway, the point you make is the critical one.Another critical point, is that the older Occidental order also understood that you did not elevate people without the combination of cognitive and character traits into the wrong level and put them into the wrong role.This is where the American model of a merchant led order is gone off the rails. The sheer number of midwits and psychopaths in the wrong role and at the wrong level is why this thing is collapsing.This is why the techno-optimists like Andreeson, Solana … … will fail. More technology will only enhance the power of the psychopaths and midwits and make things worse not better.To end for today, Google will not be able to hide the sheer evil of The Ruling Regime. I believe the anger you see coming from Kirk and Owens in recent months is sincere. As more people wake up to the scale and depths of this Regime’s evil, we may have the correct temperament, posture and will to move on from voting to the necessary actions that will bring about the clearing that will provide and opportunity to start solving problems.

                Intelligence isn’t entirely genetic, but it mostly is. Consequently, intelligent parents are much more likely to spawn intelligent children than are dumb parents. And occasional exceptions don’t undermine the rule.
PS–Successful education isn’t primarily a function of pedagogy. It depends, first and foremost, upon an intelligent student body. Hence, the best teachers can put the best information in the most compelling way before students, but if those students are dolts they’re not going to learn a dam’ thing.

                    Yep.  In other words—if you put baby Einstein in a closet until he turned 18 yo, you probably would have produced a “moron”, not a genius.  It’s easier to obstruct than to enhance.  In any event, the improvement of teachers and other environmental variables are limited by one’s genes.  Warne called this the “reaction range” of one’s genes.Taken out of the IQ context.  For example, if you were a Japanese child below the age of 5 at the war’s end, you would be expected to grow to be 4-6 inches taller than your parents due to the improved nutritional environment of post war Japan.  However, Japanese today are not at the same average height of the Western world due to their limiting genes.  They are also not a bunch of overweight, sickly wrecks—but that’s another story and explanation. 😉

                Andrew, you need to educate yourself.  You are incorrect on most *all* of your assertions.  Since you mentioned “genius”, I recommend you read “The Genius Famine” by Edward Duttton for a start.  Or conversely, educate the audience here with providing some sources for your (gratuitous) assertions.

                    Sure, Andrew is simply incorrect according to basically accepted HBD science and the body of “published” work.Take genius assertions. A low average IQ population will produce (many times) *less* genius’s than a high average IQ population. This is immediately seen/predicted from knowledge of the “Bell Curve”—the fundamental basis for understanding of intelligence. It is certainly apparent to all who live in the USA and willing to compare our Blacks to our Whites in accomplishment as expressed in highly honored, recognized individuals—and no, simply being Black is not an “accomplishment”, which knocks out about most all those so recognized.Dutton discusses the need for as many genius’s as possible and tracks such decline with decline in general society.Second, ignoring genius and then saying most work requires less intellectual savvy completely ignores the theory of the “Smart Fraction” which attempts to predict just what fraction of the population needs to have a higher IQ to keep a first world country being a first world technological society. Hint, it ain’t those with 100-105 IQ’s. It’s the engineers, doctors, technicians, etc. Note I accept that everyone can’t be of a genius level, but maintain that genius is not the entire aspect of the problem.I won’t address the programmer analogy in depth, but note that the reason most of these low IQ people can do their low IQ jobs is due to the past inventions of high IQ people. For example, I just yesterday had a technician come in to repair my washing machine. Nice guy, straight forward water valve replacement, efficient use of time and diagnostic.However, this man took the request over the phone, drove here in a specialized repair truck, replaced a valve in my washing machine. In no manner did this man invent/design or make any of these essential components used in his occupation. These were all created in the past by high IQ folk!One might think there is no reason why a low IQ populated society can’t import the creations from the minds of foreign genius. Indeed, we see the best examples of this in Africa. However, we also see that the populations are hopelessly unable to maintain, support, and extend those creations due to a low IQ populace. A good running example is SA where a 1st world infrastructure was turned over to a 3rd world population, Blacks. (…but that would never happen here, right?)Finally, there is a correlation with people of higher IQ and certain favorable/positive behavioral proclivities—such as conscientiousness, for one. A world operated/supported by low IQ, uncaring hacks is seemingly already upon us. We don’t need more, but less of those people.

                I agree. The objective of the immivasion is social anarchy and ethnic cleansing, not reduced intelligence. Even on general principles, how well you use what you have, is always more important than how much you have.The Regime needs the services of loyal, high-IQ drones, and the way they’re getting it is cosmopolitanism. Smart children get sent to distant universities, where they get indoctrinated and trained while being cut off from their childhood families, friends and roots. With the globalists themselves, one can think it’s just the Ivy League being their finishing school of choice, but if one looks at all the second-tier universities now favoring out-of-state students over in-state students, that’s not because of financial incentives. Financial incentives were made to encourage obedience to the plan. The result is a managerial class with no history, no loyalty, no culture and no friends outside of the Managerial State.High-IQ janissaries.Evil doesn’t care if we’re smart. Evil cares if we’re independent. I am now seeing headlines in Central America, of indigenous populations being uprooted into work camps designed for incompatibility with their histories and ways of life. That’s not because those primitives are ultra-intelligent. It’s because their mud-hut lifestyles are enough to bestow independence from the State.

            “Strategic depopulation” is the only end that makes any sense of the dysgenic policies of TPTB. Back in the 70s, they used to be more honest, but it didn’t poll well, and it ran afoul of the new racial orthodoxies. So they hid their true intentions behind shibboleths- Anthropogenic climate change, for example, as a proxy for overpopulation. Abortion as sexual liberation as opposed to genocide, especially for blacks.Their ultimate goals would make Thanos blush. A billion people or less, maybe half that. Part of me can’t even say they are wrong, except they seem to be hell bent on exterminating whites first, probably because they pose the greatest impediment to achieving the totalitarian state necessary to fully implement the plan.A nuclear war in the northern hemisphere would go a long way in that direction.

                The materialist inside me is certain AI will become superhuman and turn our world into chaos. But the spiritualist thinks they seem to be good only as word salad generators without understanding of the meaning of anything or the capacity to have affection for things in the real world. Unless we are just an LLM connected to sensors the AI machines are just super fast probability calculators. All the useful models require training supervised by humans who can interpret reality and validate the models.Back to the population issue. A hard pill to swallow given our current cultural idols is eugenics. This became taboo stuff connected to mustache man, but the correct idea is to have some controls over the size of the population and its level of intelligence if we want an orderly future. We used to have sci-fi to help to talk on these issues, but today sci-fi is just soap opera with intergalactic range.

                    I suppose the nature of intelligence and consciousness is the crux. Is intelligence merely the capacity to store data combined with the ability to organize and process it rapidly? If so, is consciousness simply an epiphenomenon of intelligence? And then, if the answer to the second question is yes, does consciousness then allow for the possibility of curiosity and creativity?
I hope there’s more to it than that–and there may well be–because if not, humans may be able to create a genuinely intelligent AI possessing hideous intellectual puissance.

                        I’ve started to use these initial attempts at AI.  At this point I’m curious, but ignorant—and nervous.  But as to the nature of intelligence, it seems even well known researchers in the field don’t agree.  I don’t think I’ve run across even two who define such identically—and some quite radically different.
I’ve often said. ‘“If you can’t measure it, it doesn’t exist”.  How much less if we can’t even define the construct we claim to be measuring?

        In my personal circle, I am aware of 4 miscarriages and 1 death at birth after vaccination.because of my age , many of my children’s friends are in their late 20’s and 30’s and trying to start families.  a couple of them also have been unable to conceive again.
Remember all the talk from celebrities, the wealthy, and the media about the threat of overpopulation? well they finally did something about it.
The dramatic fall in the birthrate outside africa may actually have a cause.

            I have two cousins who are at least triple jabbed who have since both given birth to evidently healthy White baby boys, one 7 months old, the other 4. But it’s high time we stopped calling it a vaccine, which it is not, has never been, and they had to change the definition of the word to make it so.

            There is a new preliminary publication of a Danish study regarding sperm quality—and it’s not good. They got their data across the last few years from sperm banks that test and evaluate “donations”. You can’t sell a defective product to a Dane…. 😉It’s not looking good. Sperm amounts precipitously in decline and motility deficient. Curiously, occurring just after the massive Covid vexxine (Can I use that descriptor, Jeffrey?) campaign. I’ve heard this before a few years ago from (I believe Sweden) but they were not certain if there would be a rebound after the jab’s wore off.Food for thought and something to watch in the literature, which unfortunately most like won’t come from USA or other poz’d countries.

Concerning the Danish study, John Campbell just posted the best video of his life about it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHQCy0jighQ
Campbell is an absolute warrior [recall that the Campbells slaughtered the MacDonalds].
And Campbell has an outstanding command of the English language.
He’s the right fellow in the right place at the right time.

                    John Campbell was full on board with all of the covid measures. He then became “red pilled” when the adverse reactions to the shots became obvious. He is now very angry about all of this because he feels he has been betrayed by his own profession. John Campbell is a good man. His anger will resonate in many of us and will have legs.

            Multi-factorial for sure. I don’t discount the vaccination thing one bit. But another issue surely must be excessive assortative mating plus said mating taking place too late (dodgy eggs and sperm) because Karen isn’t going to settle down with Bob the CFA until she’s 30+ and sure as hell not before Bob is pulling in the bux. The place I live is an expat enclave of what I’d call the B-Team. Not the A-Team masters of the universe types, but the second-stringers who support them. Everyone’s a credentialed striver of some sort or another. You see Parents pushing 40 with newborns and toddlers. That’s their first child. I’d expect to see a bunch of miscarriages and other issues if they’re starting so late in life.Anyway the level of child dysfunction is off the effing charts. Not quite, but almost everyone’s kid has some kind of developmental disability, weirdness, tic.Another thing driving miscarriages must be the pill. It’s well-known that being on the pill messes with women’s ability to mate-select and that all kinds of relationship issues can arise later when they go off the pill because they want to get pregnant with Bob from Accounting they finally settled for. But if they had never been on the pill then they would never have felt attracted to Bob from accounting who gives off subtle incompatible immune system pheromones which the pill blocked her from noticing. So get knocked up and have immunological problems and miscarry at least the first attempted pregnancy.

                Perhaps the pill is also connected to reduced testosterone, sperm count, and young men with no interest in dating…If all the young women around most men have no pheromones indicating fertility, perhaps men’s bodies stop spending energy on reproduction accordingly until better prospects are detected.

        One thing that strongly informed my views very early in life was the nonstop propaganda from middle school and high school.  This was the height of the early AIDS epidemic and of course, they couldn’t admit it was a disease which primarily affected homos, prostitutes and IVDUs.  There was also the non-stop anti-teen pregnancy propaganda.But then after graduating high school I took some years off of school before going to college.  All the mid 20s guys were constantly complaining about their child support payments, going to jail for failure to pay and the horrors of divorce for them.  I think family courts play a major role in the collapse of fertility. It breaks up marriages before a large family can be formed and it turns off a lot of men to the idea of getting married in the first place.Marriage for men is an open contract of obligations only, that is rescindable at any moment for any or no reason.  Marriage is just an incredibly bad deal for men.  Even prenumpt agreements are tossed out on a whim.  Add in the extremely overly sexualized society and what is the point of signing your life away when you can still have as much or more sex without taking on all the risks.  Plus you take on all of her debt if you marry her.I don’t think the evil family court system is the only cause and maybe not even the biggest cause, but it’s definitely a big factor in the drop in fertility.  Something like 70% of divorces are initiated by women with the most common reason is a generic dissatisfaction either in life or in the marriage.  Instead of paying a huge cost for such ridiculous decisions, they are handsomely rewarded in every way.

            I was blessed that I’m married to a woman of Eastern European extraction that I met in college who is also Catholic. It was a big selling point to her parents. Divorce, even though we’ve had our differences over the years, isn’t even on the menu for us.

        Since the 1960s &amp; 70s we have been told not to reproduce . . . green propaganda about too many people on the planet, etc.
In the 80s we were told to have “safe (sterile) sex.”
God knows what the clot shot and microplastics are doing to us now.
Throw in addition the other usual suspects, abortion, encouraging lightness in the loafers, and hatred of children along with simply making raising kids more difficult and expensive, the chickens simply are coming home (or better put not coming home) to roost.

            Looking at it long term, it is wild that places like China, Japan and Korea are collapsing in terms of reproduction.
In the 1930s, Japan was overpopulated . . . part of the reason for their subsequent war of expansion.  Korea is even wilder . . . lowest replacement in the world supposedly.  As a kid, it was always eat your food, don’t you known that some child in (overpopulated) China is starving.

                    Dystopian movies are one of my two or three favorite movie genres and I would have loved to have seen it.  However, when I saw that the film makers had casted a negress as the last pregnant woman on earth, I passed.  Wtf?  They just couldn’t help themselves. They had to do it.  I’m sure it was just another example of “Every…. Single…. Time.

                            Lemme clean up those Stargate links, they’re full of errors:
“2010”EPISODE #416ORIGINAL AIR DATE: 01.12.2001https://www.gateworld.net/sg1/s4/2010/
“2001”EPISODE #: 510AIR DATE: 08.31.2001https://www.gateworld.net/sg1/s5/2001/
List of Stargate SG-1 episodeshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Stargate_SG-1_episodes
It’s confusing because the chronological years [2010 preceding 2001] are out of order [from the point of view of Earth chronology versus Stargate &amp; its time-travel chronology].
Anyway, thank the Good Lord that some brave patriot wrote those story lines, two decades ago, to warn us what would be coming, regarding the V@xxpocalypse.

                        Don’t watch the movie as prescription but as almost a documentary.
As Z mentioned, who is reproducing?–the African woman
Who is not reproducing?–the British woman
Meanwhile, an ineffective declining state is waging a losing struggle to maintain basic law and order, despite increasingly heavy handed policing.
In the midst of all this our movies “science-minded heroes” wage their fight against the man, showing the perverse stupidity of such familiar folks.
Maybe the above was not the film makers intention (apparently the book is different), but that’s what I got out of it.

                If you knew what Korean housewives were like, you’d go play video games in the basement too. Just saying 🙂More seriously, these countries have all liberated their women following the Western lead. After 2 or 3 generations of female autonomy, it’s civilisational Game Over. In China the predatory avaricious Shanghainese woman is a standard meme. The rest of them want to follow her.It’s conceivable that the PRC leadership might decide to put women back in their traditional box, but I haven’t seen any evidence of Xi Jinping publishing a review essay of the Lysistrata in the People’s Daily. Yet.

        No civilization that we know of has gone down the path on which the West has embarked.Everycivilization we know of has gone down the path on which the West has embarked. Once civilization ripens to a certain point, birthrates collapse. Childlessness was a feature of Periclean Athens, of Imperial Rome, Siddhartha Gautama’s India, the Bagdad Caliphate, so on and so forth. There is not one single exception.If you understand comparative historiography, nothing that is happening in the West right now is at all surprising. It has all happened before; the West is treading a well-worn path towards civilization’s decline and end.

            Yep, the progress of civilization is long understood. In fact, many of the elite evils people rail against (and I’ve gotten caught up in it, too) are in large part about dealing with the decadent phase. Seems like an impossible task to deal with the decadent phase. The answer is probably to not become too civilized in the first place, but that’s probably impossible, too, because of ambition and having to learn from experience. The folly of youth and the expensive wisdom of old age, etc.

Ergo, to survive, it’s imperative that we ABANDON CIVILIZATION!!!
Then the true terror becomes the Elders of the Old Mennonite Amish foolishly allowing their daughters to possess iPh@gs.

It was an existential mistake on the part of the Elders.

        I have a 23-year-old son and see what he’s dealing with.  He was a high school athlete and now does MMA for fun – so not the low-T type.He’s dated women who turned out to be crazy despite or because of the crazy meds.He’s met lots of sluts, particularly in college when he worked as a bouncer.He too honest to do well with the liberal brainwashed women coming out of college.There is a general pessimism and malaise in his generation. They instinctively know that things are off-track and will probably get much worse before getting better.  Not the backdrop for starting big families.On the other hand, there are baptisms every week in our non-woke church.  There seems to be growing movement of traditional Christians ignoring ‘society’ and enjoying traditional lifestyles.  Our son lives 3 hours away so he’s rarely there with us, but he’s coming around to thinking that church might be the place to meet a mate.

            Your son sounds like an exception, and the times do suck, but in all seriousness the fact that Zoomers as a whole spend less time irl than anybody before them is sufficient to explain their lack of success irl.
In fact, the long flight from work, productivity, and real-world things generally is sufficient to explain why the times suck. Turns out utopia is a shithole populated by dying slobs— sorry, sophisticated cosmopolitans.

Perhaps it’s where we live here in the NE, but he told me that the dates he’s been on have been more like interviews.they ask questions such as, “You’re not into this, are you? You’re not a fan of so and so are you? Please don’t tell me you support X, Y, or Z? God, I couldn’t be seen with someone like that!”After a while his attitude is “Why friggen bother?!”

        The progress of Man has always leaned towards avoiding work and hardship and increasing titilation. What is the ultimate end state of this progress? Is it being strapped in a chair with electrodes in your brain feeding you pleasure stimuli? Is that the goal towards which we are progressing? Progress seems to be a mental disease of the West in particular. In of the pre-Westrn Japanese and the Amish. The Japanese considered themselves to have achieved a satisfactory high culture. So much so that they isolated themselves from the external “barbarians”. But were they wrong to do so? Is the average Japanese living a happier or more fulfilling life today or in those days? The Amish are another people who made a concious choice to spurn progress. Are they unhappier than we are? I agree with the Z-Man’s point that we in the West need to take a few philosophical leaps back from our starting assumptions about ourselves and humanity. We need to develop a sustainable human centered philosophy. The goal of humanity should not be to pave the way for the machines.

            Have to say, the Amish are progressing too, but more honestly and slowly. I see Amish men driving tractors here and there, Amish kids riding bicycles, young adults hanging out at Sheetz looking at their phones. Things I never saw growing up
Would they end up like us given enough time, or will their slow pace allow them to avoid the traps? Who knows.

                    Yeah, tractors and bikes aren’t a big deal imo. Horse-and-buggy Mennonites have pulled them off. Imo, bikes are the only modern transportation innovation with no downside. But the phones, that’s risky!

                        There is now fairly old technology, “flip phones”, making a comeback.  Those might foot the bill to keep the depraved Internet away, while allowing the one primary purpose of a phone—verbal communication.

                The Amish are not as virtuous as you might think. There was discussion of them on Karl Denninger’s blog some months ago about how they play the system with regards to health care and how many of them go on public assistance in places like Iowa City. They also have their own hospitals that are adept at playing government support to their advantage.

                This.The Tokugawa Shogunate Japanese were perfectly happy to filter Western technology and learning via the Dutch at Dejima and take very heavily regulated and carefully-censored doses of it. This model falls down when some asshole pirate with a letter of marque from a predatory bunch of New Englanders shows up in Tokyo Bay with a fleet of Black Ships and starts giving ultimatums about naval bombardments if you don’t submit to the budding GAE.But eschewing technology doesn’t just open you up to bullying and rule by outsiders, it also creates incentives for insiders to defect and run a techno-coup against you. And that’s exactly what happened in Japan sometime after Perry rocked up with his blackmail: the Satsuma and Cho-shu- domains were more trade-oriented and bought up lots of shiny Western military hardware and (long story short) overthrew the Shogunate, called it the Meiji Restoration, and Bob’s yer uncle.

            Agreed, but what differentiates the present demographic collapse is the tools are available to facilitate the decline, and, yes, it is being engineered to some degree. The bigger question is why the West is being inundated with alien races and ethnicities. It is contradictory, to say the least, if the goal ostensibly is to reduce the population. The Great Replacement obviously involves money and power, but beyond that the endpoint remains murky. Given the stupidity and insanity at the upper reaches of society, we can safely assume the end game is both unworkable and evil.

                The Power Structure’s motivation is quite clear to me. It’s not primarily about money or power–although those are nice ancillary dividends–but rather about neutering and punishing the white race. These people, the majority of whom are white, by the by, simply hate the white race and seek to disempower it, all for the good of the planet, of course. Their reading of history is that whites have always been responsible for all the world’s ills and the time has come to change course by subjugating us, satiating their sadistic Jones in the process. Destroying the civilization we built by flooding it with savages is perhaps the primary weapon in this demolition.

                    That’s what would seem to be the most likely explanation, but a lot of the madness is very disorganized andad hoc. My mistake may be trying to rationalize craziness.* Still, everything points to the endpoint you suggest even if the means sometimes flow from emergent behavior or insanity or some combination of those two. I remain agnostic although, again, I lean toward the anti-white and genocidal goals you propose. The fact the people at the top of the power structure are white–Puritans, really–doesn’t surprise me in the least nor is it the cause of the murkiness.*Or attribute a single motive to all involved, to be clear.

Not because they’re ‘Better’ than us…. simply because they have proven that they can go through civilisational / dynastic cycles without full-on collapses — something we’ve never managed.

                Jack Dobson: “The Great Replacement obviously involves money and power, but beyond that the endpoint remains murky.”
The endpoint is obvious: White Genocide.
Massa Lucifer invented the j00ish race as the means by which he would destroy Christianity.
The sole sole purpose of the existence of the j00z is precisely White Genocide.
Because as soon as the j00z democide [and/or sterilize] the White race, Christianity will begin ceasing to exist.
No White race == No Christianity.
It’s that simple.

                Don’t let’s forget they want one government (theirs) for the whole world.Abolishing nations is a crucial step to that end.When you remove the “ethnic” character of nations, you have moved a good step closer to abolishing nations. How do you do that? You make the demographics of countries entirely multi-racial.This will, carefully and slowly and in co-ordination with the already ongoing non-stop media and  school propaganda, lead to populaces seeing themselves as citizens of the world: a world without nations and borders.If the people (and their skin colors) are the same everywhere, and the same goes as to culture, what sense do borders and nationa make?As for actual power, the elected leaders of nationa, in the West, are already nothing more than figureheads. The formal dissolution of nation-level offices and bodies (presidency, house, senate, …) will have to follow the already performed dissolution of their power by decades, because that’s what cautious management of the deceived herd advises — nothing else.

        The Hard Truth.
Yes, there must be a culling and it’s long overdue. No, it should not be random or skew only to the bottom of the societal pyramid. For a billion years, nature dictated that this culling routinely remove the pathogens that cause disease or dysfunction, and only the strong and smart shall survive and thrive. Civilization overrode nature with man-made artificial selection and thereby caused the demise of evolutionary culling. We have been going downhill ever since.

        Low human fertility worldwide suggests something environmental, not a cause tied to local culture.  Given the presence of microplastics everywhere, from the deepest oceans to the highest mountaintops to ALL human semen, we should probably be looking much more closely at that.  Microplastics are known endocrine disrupters.

            You see some news stories about microplastics, but it seems like nobody wants to press on that alarm too vigorously since anyone who looks into it even a little realizes it’s a fait accompli. The microplastics are everywhere, in the water, the air, falling out of the sky. There’s nothing that can be done.

                Google Ngram Viewer is interesting:https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=microplastics&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-2019&amp;smoothing=3I was pretty sure this term came ‘out of nowhere’ in recent years but wanted to check if my memory was playing tricks on me. Apparently not. Didn’t exist before ~2010 and since then has been on a relentless rise.Now how much of this is due to microplastics being a serious problem only just discovered and how much is due to NGO and research grant incentives?… Here we run into the Great (Epistemological) Filter. We know there are Bad Man-Made Things out there in our environment affecting us, but how much can we trust any of the published research into them given the politics and perverse incentives abounding.

        That people decline to have children, or at least above-replacement numbers of them, really doesn’t surprise me.  The benefits of being a parent are not obvious to those who are not yet patents.   However, the many drawbacks are daunting if you actually care about these notional offspring and your own quality of life.In the US the public schools are terrible in every way that matters, so you have to plan on private school or homeschool.  Every year it gets tougher to stay middle class, let alone advance.  The State actively undermines parental authority and in some areas forbids effective discipline.  Vaccines and/or other factors are turning massive numbers of kids into dysfunctional autists.   Galf of marriages fail, and many that survive are miserable.  Divorce after children means total financial ruin for any middle class man.On top of all that core dysfunction is the fact that we don’t have a society worth preserving, and the small-hats and browns are making it worse each day.  The State is more intrusive and authoritarian each year.  And nothing, and I do mean nothing, is getting better.  Nor is there any hope of the system producing a man or party that can reverse this.It would take iron courage or total fecklessness to intentionally become a parent today.

                Great point, sadly.  The notion of a trans child is so abhorrent to me that I suppress the thought of it.  Adults who promote and facilitate such a vile thing deserve what they used to call breaking-on-the-wheel, followed by being thrown onto a pyre alive.A long-time friend of mine sent his kid to a “good” upper-middle class public school.  Hearing about the constant ‘deprogramming’ he had to do was amazing.  Cartoonish, really.  They poured nonsense into the girl’s head every day.We’re seeing that ‘banality of evil’ thing you hear about – it’s soaked into the bones of the system.  Like a rotten old house full of black mold, a complete tear down is needed.

            Hey. Hey! We’ll have none of that white-pilled shit around here.
But seriously, I totally get where you’re coming from. I’ve been married 25 years come July, and I decided, perhaps even before marriage, that I didn’t want to have kids, not because they would be some sort of burden but because I could tell, looking around at America (not quite yet AINO), that white children would have no future here. No Country for Old Men? Try No Country for White Kids on for size. Subsequent developments proved me correct, and I don’t regret my decision.

Bro.
At the risk of indulging in Phed-Po@sting, that’s precisely our next phase in securing a place in the Tree of Life for Our Race.
Going supernova.
Along the way, it would make for an excellent counter-cultural hard-rock anthem.

        There were 200 million Americans when I was a kid.  Today there are 330 million and things are much much worse.  As an example you didn’t have to reserve a space at a national park a year in advance in the 1970s.So don’t don’t me that fewer people are a bad thing,  Maybe it’s who is showing up, not the numbers, but in general I am for fewer people everywhere.  Like climate “science” don’t extrapolate data and say humanity is going to zero – it’s not – the problem is not number of people, it’s the ponzi fiat money and retirement schemes which need ever new suckers to prop up the system.  Fix those, and stable or declining populations of individual countries are fine,

        Maybe this has been already mentioned, but I’m rather surprised you didn’t bring up the infamous “rat utopia” experiments from the 1960s. The experiments provided the rats with as much food and space and activity as they could want. A utopia. What happened? The rats fertility rates plummeted and they began laying around lazily. It was a model for societal collapse.

        There are two big reasons why this topic is considered badthink.  One, when natalism comes up it’s inevitably going to lead to eugenics.    Who do we want and need more of or less of?  Who is nice to have around and who causes trouble?Second, it was a favorite topic of the artist in his struggle.   A whole chapter in fact, concentrating on Syphilis and prostitution as a big deal.   His measures targeted the problem directly and were very effective.   Orban was immediately dogpiled for enacting anything that even carried a whiff of that.To belabor that point, the devout of a certain ethic group are incredibly and proudly fecund.   The secular are the exact opposite today and seemingly outmarry and breed with nonwhites more than they do not, that is if they are not homosexuals.

            The Artist did have his little fixations. It’s more than probable that he had some personally very disturbing and traumatic experiences in early Vienna days.
But by the time he got around to dealing with it on paper, things were so bad and debauched in Weimar times that he couldn’t help strike a chord with the people.
One of my pet hobbyhorses is that artistic and literary creativity have gone by the board since the final defeat of tertiary syphilis. That’s a huge price to pay for not having noseless negroes down at the bus station.

            Longstree: “bringing blacks to America and then not sending them back.”White Christians had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with the sale of African chattel slaves in the New World.That was an entirely J00ISH industry.The j00z were completely responsible for sending the chattel slaves to the New World.And so many Sephardim settled in South America, on the various chattel slave plantations, that Sephardim [and the Crypto-Sephardim] now effectively control almost all the governments in South America [cf (((Claudia Sheinbaum))) in Mexico].That’s why the j00z attacked Pinochet so furiously, because Pinochet was successful in defeating j00ish insurrections in South America, just like Franco had been successful in defeating j00ish insurrections in Spain.There were so many Sephardim in Mexico that that’s where (((Lev Davidovich Bronstein))) fled, in search of succor, but fortunately enough, Saint Joseph Djugashvili hunted down Bronstein, and drove an icepick through its skull.PS: The obvious way to make amends to the descendants of the Transatlantic Chattel Slave Trade, is to seize all worldwide j00ish wealth, purchase a big island, and distribute equally whatever’s left of the j00ish wealth to the descendants of the Chattel Slaves, and let those descendants live in peace on their own island.[One obvious choice would be to purchase New Zealand for thedescendants of the Chattel Slaves, but we could also look at Madagascar.]

        The interesting thing is fertility rates among some groups, such as traditional Catholics, are up. Way up. Ditto for Hungary, but their government has created tax incentives for births. We seemingly only do that with blacks and other welfare parasites.I think there is something environmental that’s lowering testosterone around young males. My three sons definitely don’t have a problem with that! I see so many soyboy Zoomers that I could easily destroy in a fight and I’m in my 50s.Ramzpaul says sodomy is our new highest value and he’s correct. That’s anti-civilizational and something that in previous years has been treated as a mental illness and stamped out. The Musloids might be on to something when it comes to the gay problem, as the only way those deviants reproduce is by molesting young boys.The future belongs to those who show up. Unfortunately for us, only the Turd World teeming hordes of subhumans are reproducing.It’s like Idiocracy was a documentary.

With my five offspring, I’m not quite in their league.

                    It’s Oogabooga but it’s reproductive Oogabooga to be fair. Plus it’s (sort of) Ours. And it did work well in the past until it didn’t. Clearly we humans need ritual and group transcendence in order to thrive. And since cathedrals of light are presently very unfashionable, then I suppose smells, bells, and pronouncing ‘In principio’ per the cartoon pizza chef and not Cicero’ will just have to be the go.But TradCath only works for a small self-selecting remnant after winnow out the many LARPers. Which is fair enough. Whatever works. It’s not going to turn the greater tide though.(Disclaimer: I was born and raised one. Injected the wrong way as Joyce put it. Non serviam and all that jazz.)

            I’ve mentioned this before, but—aside from Africa—birth rates are down all over the world.  You can Google for these demographics and they show a topping out in about 20 years or so, then a decline since the follow on cohorts are much less.  Looks like a peak around 9B then decline.The world seems to be headed to perhaps half that number and then a steady state.  Our “betters” however have decided that the “perfect” world number is 500M, so there is still suspicion that they’d be happy to have a hand in pushing forward the predicted/desired world population reduction…and then there’s the Africans…These numbers are broadly from memory, you can look up the current figures.

        One thing that stands out is how weird our culture is around the decline of White people. On the one hand, you have the Disney execs openly admitting they don’t hire White men for anything: writers, directors, producers, actors, etc. because the future is basically black, female, and lesbian (seen in the latest Star Wars shows) and the anti-White male hysteria goes on as if it were 1965 and Whites were 80% of the population not 52% at most.All that stuff is coming to a head in the elites as the hysterical true believer fanatics wage war against the “realists” who understand a few basic things.You cannot build anything of complexity and POWER: SpaceX, Tesla, Twitter, the US Military Industrial complex, nor maintain it, without lots and lots of White men otherwise you get South Africa: dependent on imported Chinese labor to run everything.White men generate tax revenues and don’t consume much taxes, they are a net winner for a ruler. Just on the stuff they produce and the taxes they throw off.Non Whites are tax LOSERS, the cost of their votes and hammers against YT is enormous and ever expanding welfare states (that Whites get excluded from) and an ever present threat internally whenever up against a powerful enemy able to rile them up: Japan in WWII (black uprisings), the Soviet Union in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, Russia and China both now.You can see some of the “realists” like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and others tied deeply into the MiC (Musk did not buy Twitter on a whim — he was directed AND FUNDED to do so by the MiC deeply disturbed by the true believer fanatics). They are not our guys. But they are not on the full Pol Pot train which is something.This is becoming a problem for the regime. In the Intel / Security group, White guys are now not getting promoted and sidelined like that Disney White male exec stung by James O’Keefe. This has already happened in the Military.

            Itstartedin the military. The US Army is more “woke” than the ADL, and it has been since the ’70s. The pioneers of corporate anti-whiteness (and gay/tranny/pedo celebration) were defense contractors. “Diversity” is the imposition of an American military discipline/management strategy on civilian life. Trump was deposed via military coup. Etc.
You are exactly wrong.

        A lot of the unspoken taboo nature of this is because generations of adults have grown up with mothers swayed by the culture and torn apart by ‘What is a Woman?’ I think the ‘elites’ still haven’t decided yet. And now it’s gotten so bad that gay men get to decide. Woe is us.

        I have two nieces of childbearing age, their mom is a nurse, they all are all-in on the vax. The older niece is a hospital-based social worker, and  had to get vaxxed for work while pregnant with her second kid; the day after the newborn arrived home, the kid was in neonatal ICU for RSV. Shocker. The younger niece, now 33, also a healthcare pro in a school district (audiologist), tried for 3 YEARS – post-vax –  to get pregnant (both these women are active runners, skiers, fit, exercise all the time…. and in early 30s). Finally she had to go IVF, which her husband’s company insurance covered. OF COURSE the vax is an anti-fertility shot, and OF COURSE the purpose of Covid was to get the clotshot into the arms of as may young people as possible, while killing off the oldsters who just cost too much…

        I do think the grind of modernity plays an outsized role.  The “plenty” given by industrialization allows people to live as individual units with individual concerns.  Lethargy being what it is, the communal structures that kept it at bay held up for a while, but they’re succumbing to the tide.  What’s the fix, how do keep modernity while keeping the social structures to maintain a society?  No one has an answer yet.This excellent, and highly related, episode of Hoe Math points out that this a regression to a more primitive state, but again, no answer on how to get out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN_BDrVjWvU(On the subject of chemicals, which could probably be overcome by itself, theories such as excessive amounts of teflon in food and lithium in the environment are the big contenders).

                Lock up your women. Most men don’t need or want intellectual wives who can discuss the finer points of ‘To the Lighthouse’ with them. The men who *do* want that can go generate serious wealth so that they can afford to consort with Geishas/Hetairas/Whatevas. Every society needs a smallish class of educated, cultured expensive hos as leavening. No society can afford to have a significant fraction of its womenfolk deluding themselves that they’re meant to have ‘Important Thoughts’.

            “What’s the fix, how do keep modernity while keeping the social structures to maintain a society?”
IMHO, there are parts of modernity that I would love to get rid of.  How much of social structures are made impossible by aspects of modernity?  Like having an extended family close by.  The need to move has decimated small town, USA.  Without small town factories or farming, small towns are just not economically viable.

                    The problem is that not everyone is cut out for remote cubical work.People just act like we can have a society where only the top 50-60% of people can lead productive happy lives (not that working in a cube is productive and happy, but you get the drift)  but everyone else just sits around tent cities shooting up, shoplifiting their next meal, selling dope or transfering and in and out of prison on petty crime convictions or living at least partially on the dole.The economy and society need to work for most people.  There is always a bottom .25 to 1 percent who simply cannot be civilized.  They will always exist. But we have massively increased the number of these people.  Not only do we have the people just above the very bottom who are also now at the very bottom, we have a huge section above that of people not making it working retail and other dead end low paying jobs. I say they aren’t making it because besides working these jobs, we have a huge welfare system subsidizing their employers. They can only afford to work these jobs because they get gov benefits.In dissident circles, I really get the feeling that most people don’t have a lot of contact with the lower classes.  With the smart 1/2 of the population either leaving to go to a city somewhere or locked in their house on a remote computer connection, the other 1/2 is lost.  They aren’t going to go out and open a business or something.

        To state the obvious, Christendom couldn’t solve the crisis of the late Middle Ages, but the combination of Enlightenment and Commerce that became Modernity could. Now there’s a crisis of the late Modern Age that Modernity can’t solve, and whatever shapes the next age will.What that thing is, I think we’re still figuring out. I’m not sure if high tech is the answer or the internal contradiction that’s causing the crisis. I remember reading Marx and him basically admitting that communism is a sci-fi fantasy that depends on high tech, so I lean towards the latter.People are finding religion again, and I think that will probably be part of the solution, but I don’t think it will be a return to medieval Christianity. I don’t think it will be a return to paganism, either, or any of the Christian-like modern religions. I think Christianity will probably continue to split and speciate, and that will bring people back to church. Which I’m OK with, because I don’t think Gentiles will, in effect, worship foreign gods, even if they can’t voice it that way. I’m a Protestant, and we’ve got the Scripture thing down, but we need to get back to OUR church and OUR traditions.Beyond that, though, I’m not sure. I don’t think we’re going back to a palace economy, but if the capitalist/communist matrix pushes us to high tech and anti-humanity, it won’t have a place in the future.Wrt making babies, that’ll come with a return to production instead of consumption, so I’m not very worried about it. If nothing else, we’ll have to stop consuming. I’m more sure about that than all the other stuff.

        On a different topic there was an experiment popularly called Mouse Utopia, done decades ago in which an overcrowded colony of mice experienced severe social dysfunction despite ample food and a comfortable environment. One of the results was that they stopped reproducing and some childless mice started attacking the young. Perhaps there’s something in it relevant to our situation.

        While fertility is below replacement in the US overall, it isn’t within certain subgroups. According to Ed Dutton, religiosity is positively correlated with fertility, while being a blue-haired leftist weirdo is negatively correlated. In the spirit of “the future belongs to those who show up,” this just means the spiteful mutants will die off: not a bad outcome.Abortion plays some role in this, so anti-abortion laws are somewhat dysgenic. But, more important, letting the kooks slowly write themselves out of history by staying out of baby-making altogether might just solve a host of other problems. This would lead to a decline in  population, which would be unpleasant, but not to human extinction or to a catastrophic collapse. It would be more along the lines of “weak men create hard times…” After passing through those hard times, good times return and the cycle repeats.

                We will see. So far she has taken the tack of non comment, instead of her rookie peer Ms. Brink that started in with this ‘I have whyte priv’ stuff before her season-ending injury.
She can go the ‘Jordan’ route and remain apolitical, but the race war is a thousand times more virulent now and ‘silence’ has been, in the logic of race baiters, neutered by claiming it equals agreement with whatever they posit is ‘ist’ and thus bad.

        Great show – I love these 50k foot topics..
What is interesting to consider and Z points it out towards the end is that there is the potential of a foundational element of our biology is changing, perhaps because of environmental reasons (chemicals, plastics, etc.) or because we’ve “won” the Game of Life and have conquered Nature. Perhaps we are in the beginning of Nature changing her rules for a new game?

        I’m in the camp that collapsing birth rates are Nature – God – correcting an error.
it’s also possible it’ll lead to an evolutionary leap.  Homo sapiens wiped out and absorbed the Neanderthals IIRC.  There is, probably, an emergent species that will easily prey on weak humans who are unwilling and incapable of defending themselves.
We’re only at the top of the pyramid because God keeps knocking the previous placeholders off the throne.

        I am editing my comment, because I haven’t listened to the entire podcast, so I might be missing the mark here. But anyway, this really isn’t that hard.Go find a chart of the global human population and zoom out over the past 400 years, or even 12,000 years. That line has gone up like a cryptocurrency or memestock.One reason is that due to scientific advancements, we have significantly reduced infant mortality. I remember have lucid moments in my 20s while interacting with certain people and asking myself how they were still alive. Civilizations protect humans from the constant cleansing effect of nature.A low mortality rate for most of the human population (who are barely above feral wild animals) is extremey unnatural.Anyway, humans thought they pulled one over Nature. Except the problem of course is that anything that rises rapidly also declines rapidly.You cannot go from a population below 2 billion in 1900 to 8 billion today, and not expect it to completely collapse back down rapidly as well.The human population pumped. Now it’s dumping. Not coincidentally, you got perennial pump&amp;dumpers like Elon Musk (see his shenanigans with dogecoin) worrying about the dumping of humanity.Beyond the fact that humanity is a meme stock – something Jordan Peterson didn’t seem to fully understand the implications of when he mentioned humanity being mimetic in his interview with Tom Bilyeu, there is another perspective to consider:Most humans cannot survive long-term in a resource abundant environment. Most of us are not wired for it. In that sense, humans are no different than the rodent experiments of John B. Calhoun – too much of food, water, shelter and you end up with first a spiritual death and then a physical death of a species.This is because resource abundance = paradise. Do you know what we call the natural inhabitants of paradise? The Meek. Hency why the Meek inherit the Earth.What is a different word for “resource”? Carbon. The more carbon you have, the more food and usable water (see carbon-poor environments like the desert and the ice as counter examples…those environments are also known as wastelands in mythological terms).The rise of carbon in the atmosphere is leading to a noticeable greening of the planet. We are effectively turning this planet back into a blue and green one. Unfortunately that’s the equivalent of bringing back Jurassic Park of Kong’s Skull Island.Paradise is highly hostile to 99% of the human population, just as the desert would be hostile to a polar bear, or the shark-filled Pacific ocean was hostile to stranded American soldiers in WW2.In conclusion, the fertility rate is dropping, that’s always what happens when a) populations explode exponentially like some memestock, b) the natural environment itself changes.As I’ve said many time before, Nature has the last laugh. Edit: I just skipped to the end of the podcast, and Z hits it on the nail with bringing up Nature. “Nature always win” – Z. Absolutely.

        No, Z, you’re not married and don’t have a family because you’re fundamentally a eunich. No offense is intended – harsh as it is, men such as yourself are needed in society. You’re part of the mandarin class that makes the wheels go round-‘n-round. But the hard truth is a balanced man is ready to work, fight, and screw at the drop of a hat. The hardships that come from experiencing that trifecta shapes a man to lead himself and others, eventually a family, to survive and thrive. You’re not capable of that. And that’s fine, as I said, every functioning society requires a class of nutless men who can’t keep a woman in her place and rear children, it leaves them to focus on a particular array of persuits that might be vital to the running of a society.

The masses just don’t give a hoot about anything outside the short’n’narrow ‘bread and circus’ axis.On the other hand, TPTB also do not give a damn about what the few thinking proles care about.  (That’s why places like this are allowed to exist.)

        I’ve been laughing at the downvotes hurled at men who raised their daughters not to put themselves in a position where some bum could load them up with three kids, then trade her out for a younger sluttier model.i have three kids, two girls, so I speak as a man who is operating above the mean.  You are an idiot if you don’t raise your girls to be able to support themselves, because with divorce rates at 43% for first marriages, and those divorces happening at roughly the 8-year point, any family with children is going to create a single mom.  And if those kids are young, their odds of living in poverty go through the roof.I have friends and immediate family who have found themselves in dire straights.  They left the workforce to raise kids, their husband had an affair, and they’re divorced with 2-3 kids and no ability to get a decent paying job.Raise your daughters properly, or consign them to poverty.  This has been known for thousands of years.  If your girls settle down to raise a family, it is imperative they continue to maintain useful skills.  Not just if their husband turns out to be a bum, but people died young, so have something to fall back on.  Oh and families are hard ass work.  So having a job and knowing how to work is kind of an important skill in a world where women don’t spend their days growing food.And while you’re at it, raise your boys properly.  Marriage is not acrobatics on pornhub.  Successful marriages are give and take.  If you want a trad family and your wife stays home, you have made a lifelong commitment, and that means not being a dick.25 years married.  Three kids in college or the workforce.  Well adjusted and living their lives.The worst marriages in the world are the ones formed out of desperation.Now my kids are all 23 or younger.  Grandkids will happen.  And if we need to we’ll make it easy for them to live close to us.  If you want grandkids, be prepared to be a great grandparent.

                where some bum could load them up with three kids, then trade her out for a younger sluttier model.Meanwhile, back on Planet Earth, since I saw my first divorce up close at age 10 (My sister, the eldest of us siblings, divorced her first husband), of all the divorces I’ve known of and knew the divorcing couple or at least one partner, exactly ONE was the husband running off with a younger woman. The fact his wife was a sarcastic, shrewish ball-buster of a lawyer had a lot to do with it.The rest? Yeah, it was theWIFEfiling for divorce. That “Irreconcilable Differences” covers a lot of ground I tell you.My sister filed for divorce from her first husbandMy current brother-in-law (my sister’s second husband) saw his first wife file for divorceMy late ex-sister-in-law filed for divorce from my eldest brother and took their children across state lines in violation of the divorce decreeI have a cousin on my side of the family who divorced her first husband and remarriedA cousin on my wife’s side of the family got divorce papers from his ex-wife, who decided she’d rather be with the guy she was dating than her husbandYou get the picture. I could add examples of friends, divorced women I dated, and co-workers but I don’t want to crash Z’s site.Men leaving women? Only if they’re so fantastically wealthy they can weather the financial hit.

            90% of America’s current problems are directly related to vastly empowering the nation’s daughters, and replacing men and boys in society with women and girls.Your problem is FEMINISM the word nobody wants to use, not even ‘conservatives’ and so-called Christians.  That’s because over the past four decades, daughters went to the front of every line . . . and now dominate and rule all your institutions.  ALL your institutions.Daughter-daddy made sure for half-a-century that his princess grabbed up all the gender-perks (and they were/are endless), attended Slore U., and embarked on her AA-favored career.  No more trad requirements to marry her off early, else Dad would be stuck lifelong with her upkeep.  Nah!  The woke-fem State is her liege now.Daddy and the State are her lifelong ‘husbands’.  She Don’t Need No Man! they roar in celebration and victory, while everything in the nation fails and falls.  Because you can’t just replace men with women at everything and expect continued function.  Ask for an insane and evil society, you get it.

        US births per woman has beenconsistentlybelow replacement rate (2.1 per woman) for over 50 years. Honorable mention for a slight bump from about 1993 through 2009, called the echo from the Baby Boom, I think. But even its peak (2009) was still under 2.1. This means several things, and one doesn’t even need training in demographics or sociology to infer them. Here are but a few:The rate stood at about 3.5 as recently as 1958. From there it fell precipitously (blame The Pill) in the 1960s and 70s to about 1.78 in 1979 and save the small bump cited above, has stayed mostly flat at about 1.78.Any population growth (and there has been substantial) must have come from net immigration.Many other “first world” countries have had even lower birth rates.The below-replacement rates necessarily mean that the legacy population of a particular nation whether Caucasian, Japanese, Chinese, etc. is shrinking. First-world nations with growing populations are always, or almost always, due to net third-world immigration.“The Great Replacement” is demographic reality, not conspiracy theory.Whether all this is some diabolical plan orchestrated by a cabal of Jewish billionaires in a hollowed-out volcano or under the Swiss Alps is open to conjecture and thus is fertile ground for conspiracy theorists. Or perhaps it’s just the net result of a lot of stupid choices, failing to take difficult decisions or simply changes in society and even technology (e.g. birth control) over several generations. Or a combination of unhappy factors.Most of Africa’s fertility rates make 1958 America look like a Shaker community in comparison. There is some net growth in Latin America and parts of Asia but they lag far behind Africa. These figures suggest that Africa’s surplus population will continue seeking better homes and that probably means Western Europe. North America will continue to welcome Latinos and all regions will accept miscellaneous folk from wherever.Certain suggested solutions, like raising the birth rate of the legacy population, of halting immigration or deporting newcomers, are “theoretically” possible but utterly impractical and impossible-adjacent when subject to political and other constraints. Or that when a people reach a certain level of affluence they tend to have smaller families. While there’s some truth to that last one, at this late date this is mostly whistling past the demographic graveyard. People who voice such views have been spending a bit too much time at the local Hopium den.Maybe the Alphas will keep a breeding stock of Caucasians and East Asians on hand to supply the Betas and other high functioning underlings for technical and other essential tasks. But overall, it looks like a (with apology to Huxley) Grave New World dead ahead.

        I find this interesting more as an academic subject. Like what’s highest the average generational time difference on a matrilineal line?
I only go back in the US five generations. My mother’s mother’s mother’s mother’s mother (i.e. 3x great grandmother) would have been 153 when I was born, had she been alive. So that’s 30.6 years per generation.

            And truth be told, men think this too, no matter how much they say they are conservative. If they meet an AWFL who wants to settle down with them, they think those women are better than women who aren’t an affluent liberal. These are the women who have power, and men know it.

        I’ll never understand why anyone would ever eat frozen pizza.  It is disgusting. It tastes like cardboard with fake cheese on it.
I get my pizza fix by ordering pizza about once a month.  It’s really not any more expensive than the frozen stuff, but it tastes good.

            I’m a pizza guy myself, but most pizza places are pretty bad out here—yet they stay in business.  Why?Years ago while driving to work, the radio station had a call in for folk to give an up vote to their favorite pizza joint.  I immediate waited to hear mine mentioned since I just knew they made the best pizza.  Never came up.  In about 20 minutes they had over two dozen places and none had more than two or three up votes.  Conclusion?  There’s no explaining taste.  I bet your “cardboard” pizza also has a great and large fan base.  🙁

Also, there is a place called Pizza Bianco in Phoenix of all places, that is reputed to make perhaps the best pizza on the planet. Being in Phoenix, the pizzaioli simply puts the pies on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant to bake them…

            Heh. Got to disagree with you a little bit there, pardner. Good pizzeria or homemade pizza is certainly optimal, but there are perfectly decent frozen pies out there that’ll work in a pinch. Just got to avoid the corporate crap–Tombstone, Freschetta, Red Baron, etc. That said, I don’t eat frozen pizza often, just occasionally.

        Alot of people just don’t have kids. I think the “childfree” child hating movement is overblown. But everyone White in major cities is following a similar schedule:Early 20s: partying, having fun.Mid/late 20s: starting career, developing hobbies, still seeing friendsEarly 30s: finally owning some property, enjoying some money and salary.Mid 30s: might meet a girl now or in your early 30s. By this point it’s already pretty late in your reproductive life. You might have 2 kids max, maybe 1. You might just not really feel like it anymore at that point and have 0.The time just passes and suddenly you have a fertility rate of 1.0 or less. Due to women’s empowerment this is the schedule you have to follow.You also have older, high value, single guys dating young women. Also, at least 50% of the young women you meet will be foreign and / or brown.There are so many issues.Also, contrary to their boasts, non-white birth rates in North America have totally crashed and will be well below white birth rates soon.

        The biggest cause of fertility decline since 2016 is likely xenostrogens, of which the microplastics is one form of. However, the biggest source of xenoestrogens does not come from plastics manufacturing. It comes from modern agriculture. You see, all modern pesticides are hormone mimickers. This is because the original pesticides (1970’s and before) actually killed the bugs and a lot more. They really were an environmental disaster in the making. So the hormone mimickers were developed to replace them, and did so starting in the 1980’s. You really can’t have modern agriculture without them (unless we develop full-on SF-style biotech food factories) and without modern agriculture, the world can sustain a population of maybe 4 billion at best. Come to think of it, this is the most prosaic (and benign) explanation for avoidance of discussion about the fertility issue.

        The root cause of the demographic collapse was the Church of England at the 1930 Lambeth Conference approving contraception. All the major Protestant churches soon followed. The Catholics objected and still insisted it was wrong. Hence the Baby Boom in the U.S., which largely was Catholic. The Pill came out in 1960. When he came to power in 1963, Pope Paul VI was under great pressure to approve the Pill. John D. Rockefeller tried to bribe him. Typically, Paul dawdled, but in 1968 came out with Humanae Vitae, which upheld eternal doctrine that contraception was a mortal sin – and he warned about a coming demographic collapse. Typically again, he didn’t enforce it. Neither did John Paul II or Benedict XVI. Nor did they discipline politicians when abortion was legalized.Now Pope Francis’ top people are pushing for allowing contraception, much as he already has allowed divorce, a heresy. He has not done so yet, but might, although it would be another heresy. There’s a good discussion of this on Rorate Caeli, a traditionalist site, and the link follows.It’s too late to repair the demographic damage already done. But the first step toward any demographic restoration, especially of Europeans, is for a new, strong pope to reiterate not only the abortion ban, but the contraceptive ban – and enforce it with stern sermons and excommunications. Instead, Francis is about to excommunicate Archbishop Vigano, a faithful prelate.The good news is God is in charge. The best thing would be for a reactionary black African pope to slip in because he’s “progressive” on politics, but ends up tending to business restoring the faith on marriage and babies.The link:https://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2024/06/popes-anti-tlm-theologian-shows-his-pro.html

            Among the worst conservative hopes is that some “based black man” is going to ride to your rescue when you refuse to solve the problem yourself.

            The extent of your ignorance is only surpassed by your unfounded confidence.
France saw a dramatic collapse in fertility rates in the 19th century. One of the drivers of European politics was the growing imbalance betwween France and Germany in terms of population size.
America was not a majority Catholic country post WW2 and the idea that the Baby Boom was a religious phenomenon is literally incredible.
