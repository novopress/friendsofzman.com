        “…while they went off to college…”?I need some clarification here.When the “level of education” statistic is cited, does that mean to imply intellect, knowledge, wisdom, and logical thinking, or does it merely describe credentials awarded  for attendance at an institution “accredited” by folks from, and reliant on, institutional attendance?
