        Yeah, I get the iHate for Apple products, but what others here have said is mainly true: their stuff just works, in comparison to windows PC environments. If you are like me and can solve your PC problems fairly easily, you get a lot of bang for your buck with a PC running windows (though 8 is a piece of total crap). If you have limited knowledge, then the Macs are the way to go. But I have to say I do love my iPad.

        I cannot afford the hassle of Microsoft products. I simply find Apple’s stuff to be simple, elegant, reliable and user friendly. This makes them the BEST VALUE for my needs.That said, I sense it has started to deviate from what made it such a great value for those sharing my needs. iTunes is now ridiculous, each new version of the OS seems to gain more in bloat than functionality.I economize by just using a Mac Mini connected to a generic monitor, and 99.9% of my actual usage is on either my iPad or IPhone. I look forward to the day when computers are all as easy or easier to use as tablets are today. My guess is Apple is the company to do it, if not, the next Apple will emerge.

        Several years back, Steven den Beste wrote about four long essays debunking all of left’s “renewable” energy schemes.
No one ever mentions the crime problem with charging up a car: the only time you’d bother to stop at a charging station is when you had to. Once you’re plugged in, you’re a sitting duck.

        Dealing with windows was a real pain in the ass, but XP was leaps and bounds ahead of what came before it. Since Windows 7 I haven’t had much of an issue with PCs. They are a slight hassle, but well worth the price discount and much larger software/game library.

        Dear Mr. Z,
re:http://pando.com/2014/03/25/newly-unsealed-documents-show-steve-jobs-brutally-callous-response-after-getting-a-google-employee-fired/
I read the page and thank you for the link. Not being in business per se and even less attuned to legalistic shenanigans I can not see the evil in having an anti-poaching policy or for that matter problems with insider trading. Given the concept of trade secrets I can see why a company would want to have an anti-poaching policy.
As to Jobs being evil, possibly. That Gates and Ballmer are evil, I am convinced that they were and probably currently are. Read this web page for information:http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2006/pulpit_20060330_000890.html/

        Don’t know why everyone has so much trouble with their PCs. make sure to use anti-virus and a firewall and no problems – I use Dell towers for five years before replacing. stay away from nasty websites and filesharing as well.

        Apple hardware is overpriced, but the OS just works so my last two laptops have been used Apples.  You can buy a Windows machine for less than a used Apple but you’ll pay for it in time wasted with upgrades, drivers, bugs, anti-virus software, excessive reboots, etc.  I am a DIYer with a degree in computer science but after nearly 30 years of tinkering I just got tired of it.  A common basic PC should just work and the Apple largely does.  I use iPhone as well. I experimented with Android and it looked like another time sink.  But I still agree that Apple fanboys and status seekers suck.  And Jobs and Gates are both ruthless tyrants.  And an Apple car is a stupid idea.

        I think the trade off between MAC and Wintel is a semi-closed development environment versus a semi-open development environment, respectively.  The advantages/troubles/peculiarities that each platform has largely stem from that one tradeoff.There are so many drawbacks to battery-powered cars:• Power loss in cold weather due to slowing in battery chemical reaction (physics, can’t be changedas far as I know)• The battery waste stream (it takes nasty chemical reactions to produce a lot of energy)• The very best batteries are an order of magnitude lower in energy density than gasoline (some physics, some engineering… nano-materials might mitigate)• Replacement costs of the battery pack (last time I checked was in 2006, but at that time it was $3,800 for a new battery for a Prius, before labor)• The fast charging issues which are very well explained above (physics and engineering)• The continuing issues with Li ion batteries “brewing up” (engineering)Which doesn’t mean we won’t ever have electric cars.  I just don’t see them ever being powered by chemical batteries without some weird physics/chemistry.  I tell my tech savvy, environmentally concerned friends that if they want to make a difference, by a quality subcompact.

            The major problem with solutions like electric cars is they require starting from a blank sheet of paper. If your plan has the words “replace the energy grid” in it, the plan is not going far. It’s why technology that allows for the economical conversion of natural gas into gasoline has more promise, in my view. We can make really clean cars now. There’s not a lot to be gained there, but there are gains to be had in how we get our gasoline.

        2 points:1) The Z Man and Denninger are joined at the hip: Apple is the enemy! Great company Mr. Z.
2) BTW, Apple is using UNIX as it foundation as developed at NeXT in the 1980s, Steve Job’s startup when he was booted from Apple. This UNIX skeleton is seamless across Apple’s entire spectrum of products that is, hundreds of millions of devices: Macs, iPads, iPhones, iTvs, iPods–one OS to rule them all, an OS designed from the ground up to be secure, an OS with nearly fifty years of development.

        I’m one of those early Mac adopters, but being forced by my trade (bean-counting) to work on Windows based machines for the last twenty five years or so, I can say without reservation that the Mac and the Mac OS is just a superior product, hands down, and well worth the premium price.The time wasted trying to make Windows machines behave is just ridiculous for such a ubiquitous product. Every single one I’ve worked on fills itself up with garbage malware and viruses that slow its performance to a crawl in a matter of weeks.Switch to Macs and you can fire your IT department.

        I recently got a MacBook Air, after years of trouble with the physical durability of Windows notebooks and Windows software problems.I have had many cheap Windows notebooks, and while the early ones lasted two years, the newer ones never made it a year. Expensive ones aren’t any better. The Chinese make terrible stuff. I travel and while I don’t throw my computer bag around, it takes a certain amount of knocks.Windows 8 is confusing to me. It may be great but I never figured it out. Notice that companies with IT support use XP or Windows 7 Professional, which are more traditional and reliable. Having to reboot every twenty minutes got pretty old.I could have gone with a Chromebook and maybe I would have if I was more broke. I looked at a tablet as an option but I need a real computer. People who are not yuppie or hipster snobs said this was a good reliable option, so I swallowed and wrote a big check.I don’t think there is any real good option with technology. Cheap reliable computers and other devices that respected your privacy would be great, but there’s nothing out there like that. For me Apple was the least worst option.

        Progs don’t particularly want electric cars either. They want planned communities (planned by them), where electric rail and electric bus transport the drones that are not walking or on bikes.

        I’m in the battery business, and the greatest impediment to electric vehicle technology is the current infrastructure and the politics of the left.In the golf car market – a true electric vehicle – the switch to lithium ion batteries is hampered by the need to dedicate a full transformer to charge a fleet of cars.  The power load overwhelms the current setup, so the investment for mass usage dwarfs the investment made in ‘upgrading’ the cars themselves.The chargers for current electric vehicles are designed to maximize and regulate what is available without burning through the lines.  It’s a resistor cutting back the flow, and Li-ion in particular will just draw and draw, so you get inefficient (compared to its capabilities) charging times to run-time, and the math just doesn’t work.This is the same limitation in electric passenger – entire neighborhoods of electric vehicles would overwhelm the system because the transformers and lines aren’t built to move that much energy that quickly, with the added problem that the power generation isn’t designed to consistently put out enough to make everything electric.You are correct that – much like the rest of the digital and entertainment economy – it is parasitic, but the final limit is progressive politics:  The move to electric will require a move to nuclear and lots if jobs for burly men to rebuild the entire infrastructure of the grid, and the progs would rather abort their dreams than let either of those happen.

        I don’t know, I can see them lining up for the icar weeks in advance just to be the “first”.  Then off to starbucks for a latte, a swing by the Whole Foods for whatever is trending, off to Pilates, and home to some off-gendered mate.

            I’m torn on the whole electric car thing, which is where Apple is probably heading with their car project. If they can create a battery you can fully charge in minutes, even 30 minutes, that can give you a day of drive time, maybe there’s a future for electric cars. Otherwise, they are a pointless hobby. Tesla has reached the point where they can use a special charger to give you two hours of driving after 30 minutes of charging. The price is staggering.The more I read about the progress they have made, the more convinced I am that they have reached a cul-de-sac of sorts with battery technology. I just don’t think any of us will live to see the day when electric cars are practical for mass usage.
