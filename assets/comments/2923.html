        The One, like Moses and Jesus, had a miraculous birth and childhood. Good start if you want to pull the oceans back, but Stanley Dunham could give both those old timers  lessons in miracles. That’s his boy.

        I hope everyone is enjoying their “post-racial” America, courtesy of the Person Occupying the White House. When I put on my very best tinfoil hat, I wonder if he is a Moslem plant, who teemed up with the Marxists as a cover story. Of course, just as you say, those who voted for him largely know nothing about him. The Cult of Personality wins the day.

        No one knows who Obama really is, if You look to his mother family it screams CIA, She dates AND married useful Foreigners for The USG.
But who really made Obama into POTUS was The Chicago Jewish elite.

        I am convinced that there is some very small part of the brain which, when malformed or under developed, causes the sort of disorders, common and even necessary in young people, to become a permanent feature of the adult personality. Such people are immune to argument or experience, and even find it repugnant.

        “Yet, the Left is always surprised that Obama is what he says he is.”
That single sentence perfectly encapsulates the last 6 years of American history.

        Good God! Matthews has some weird heroes…McNamara &amp; Rusk? The policy geniuses who brought us the Vietnam War? (Though I think Mathews is unfairly leaving out another Harvard genius –  McGeorge ”  I made mistakes of perception, recommendation and execution” Bundy.)“We were wrong, terribly wrong. We owe it to future generations to explain why.” — McNamara, writing in his 1995 memoir, In Retrospect, on the management of the Vietnam Warhttp://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1913028_1913030_1913022,00.htmlhttp://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64713/lawrence-d-freedman/lessons-in-disaster-mcgeorge-bundy-and-the-path-to-war-in-vietnaLet’s just hope that Obama doesn’t find the next Rusk &amp; McNamara.These guys always fail up. McNamara was made head of the World Bank.Here’s a cheerful McNamara story about the Martha’s Vineyard ferry and almost just deserts:http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19950423&amp;id=MJosAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rfwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6760,3373322You can always tell a Harvard man – You just can’t tell him much.
