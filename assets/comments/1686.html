        I live in NM.  A lot of illegals are pious Catholics, blue collar, and do not like predators.  They are a kind of unintended stabilization, repelling jihadists, predatory white collars, ect.
A mixed bag, to be sure.  Sort of like Ohio in the sixties, in Amish country.
A country could do worse than to be transformed into a Northern European/indigenous admixture of migrants that adhere to a normative moral and ethical code.
The torch gets passed, people get erased, and replaced.  Politics sometimes seems to be trying to manage the rate.  Or, having kids to feed.

        Do you factor in the increase in single parent households during that time period?

            I would doubt the number of single parent homes, as a percentage of the total households, increased much at all. Divorce rates topped out in the early 90â€™s. Then you have the sharp rise in Mexican households which have 85 people living in two bedroom apartments.
