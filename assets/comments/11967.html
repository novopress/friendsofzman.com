        “… I know from the comments here, and the e-mails I receive, that a lot men in the professional ranks are “our guys” but they keep quiet about it. That’s a necessary thing, but it also means it is easy to feel like a stranger in the world …”When the tide turns and it is advantageous to be openly on the right at one’s workplace, the hordes of sheeple who presently are enthusiastic proponents of the prog line will unhesitatingly jump over to our side.It would be nice to be able to separate these idiots from those who are presently “our guys”. Which means that our guys are going to have to sooner or later stick their necks out or risk being lumped together with those they most despise.

            It’s tough operating way behind enemy lines. You develop little rituals to figure out who the like minded might be, but even at the upper echelons you have to be careful.  Back right before the election was at the semi-annual exec management meeting for my new firm and at the opening dinner happened to get assigned to a table wth a bunch of guys from a midwest based division that has primarily ag industry customer base.  Clearly being from NY was the odd guy out.  So we played a funny game of “20 questions” before they figured out I was only 1 gen removed from farming in the midwest and we were all part of the same “thing”.   But clearly they were wary as the firm is foreign owned and run by a  lot of Brits and Aussies that buy the Prog thing enthusiastically.   We had a great time after that.  They correctly called Trumps win btw.

        I was thinking about how best to say “the non-aggression principle is for pussies.”One of the things that you get wrong often is that you think the beltway “libertarians” are really libertarians. So be it, I was not put on earth to teach you that Rothbard and Hoppe are further to the right than you will ever be.But your take on the NAP is obviously very far off. “Don’t start no shit, but finish it every time” is a saying that we had in the hills decades ago. The NAP is merely good morality — I will not attack you without cause but I will beat you to death (or put a cap in your ass) if you attack me.I have morally asked men before to “take you best shot coward”. It has always been hard to get an asshat to start something when he realizes that someone is hoping for a reason to kill him.The NAP is not a statement of pacifism.

            We probably share the same Scots-Irish background.  Grew up around a lot of relatives that actually did kill people in far away places. They had very little tolerance for loud mouths and threats. Though it’s only happened a handful of times in my life, funny how just standing there calmly and looking straight at the guy doing the “chimp out” and saying “ok, have at it” shuts things down in a hurry.

            Seems to me the NAP is whatever anyone wants it to be. One of those things that can be interpreted any which way.
Some people think Christianity is a suicide pact.  I think pope Urban II would disagree.

            Not being sarcastic here.  Do you believe there might come a time where it would be morally justified to “take the first shot” in an effort to prevent this country from proceeding further from the point of no return?  I am already at the point myself where I believe violence will be required to either bring this country back to something even closely resembling its beginnings, or to change it into something that is not a collective socialist welfare state legislating eventual white extinction.

Yes. If a group is committing aggression against me, and the left is doing so, then the NAP says I am moral in returning the aggression. They have tried to destroy us, and we of the right need to fight back.
The NAP does not get in our way to defend ourselves.

                    Since “the NAP is for pussies”, attack, attack, attack!
Well, the right has been attacking the wrong people, and defending the wrong people, for decades.
The Left need simply seize the tools the Right has built.And soft targets are so much easier.
You should be heartened, Zman!They’re going to make people “better”!
(The NAP is also called “good fences”.)

                I agree. And the hotshot – whether he’s a libertardian or some other proggie variant that dares me to ‘take the first shot’ will be dead before he hits the ground, while I draw a bead on the cretins about to follow him.

        “Co-opting existing institutions is how the New Left won the culture war 50 years ago. It’s a good model to follow.”I keep saying on other blogs that one tool for re-taking our failed education system is to take over the accreditation system.  Once in place, start demanding academic rigor from the schools, else they lose their accreditation.  If that happens, their degrees are only worth the paper they’re printed on.  For example, their bachelor’s degree might then be deemed inadequate preparation for entry onto a master’s program at another college.  Or, if a student decides to change colleges, credit for their courses might not be transferable to the new school.Gee, performance standards — what a concept!

        Getting your hooks into Woods could pay big dividends.
He definitely understands the shifting mediascape and he’s going to be around for a long time. His following, like Molyneux’s, even if it is numerically still smaller than the audiences guys like Hannity or Rush Limbaugh gets, is more engaged than theirs are. Pound for pound, podcast listeners are worth more.
Woods is in the Rothbard/Deist/Rockwell/Hoppe orbit of libertarians, which is a prime segment for us to peel off. Hell, we don’t have to peel them off–they’re defecting to our side in droves as is.

            He needs to just go ahead and compile a book of the craziest girl science papers, with his expert fisking as commentary, and self-publish it if he has to. Z-Man is on to something, there. Humor’s a great weapon.

        “At the same time, spending time with a bunch of old guys is an eye opener. Most of us experience our politics on-line, through blogs, social media and videos. The people at the Mencken event experience their politics from network news, the cable chat shows and paper magazines. A lot of what we take for granted, they don’t know exists. What they do know about the emerging counter culture, they don’t fully understand. It’s not simply an age thing. Its that there is a necessary bit of self-ghettoization on our side.”Well written. I’ve thought the same thing many times, but you put it so concisely. By the way, I’m an older guy who got involved with computers in the early eighties and was an early internet adapter. I’d say about half the people I know who are my age are still stuck with old media…and predictable attitudes.

        I am in NYC this week with the fam, else I would have attended. I was wondering the age bracket when I looked at the site.
There are many of us. I get to talking with my neighbors in management or who own their own business, and I learn about their frustrations with the cat lady crowd or their troubles dealing with the dusky bit of labor, and I smile…

        Something I think about occasionally is how on earth were those farmers able to beat the British Army : how could they possibly organize under the noses? How could they avoid arrest? The Sons of Liberty yes, and the minutemen sure, but how were they able to communicate and coordinate reliably?  I think the situation is close enough an analogy – there was a thing called a “mob captain” for when you needed to make some noise. Look up the Loyal Nine.  I’ve never heard of them until this writing.  The Committees of Correspondence. These were men not afraid to use intimidation and violence, who had ways to coordinate their efforts.  As I said it’s something I roll around in my head

            Avoiding the supernatural truth that America was meant to be, I think time, distance from England, and the land mass of the American Colonies made the American Revolution successful. Plus, the debt of and the obligation to police the far flung British Empire. The British had a similar problem to Germany during WWI and WWII. How could Germany, a land of about 80 million people, control an area the size of Europe, parts of North Africa, and the Soviet Union? They couldn’t and there was never any doubt they would fail. It boils down to the length of supply lines, number of soldiers, and area of land that needed to be subdued. Same with the British. There is no way Britain could control an Empire and fight a war so far from their shores. Throw in a portion of the French Navy and it was just a matter of time. What I find fascinating is that there were as many pro-British colonists as there were those that supported independence. Sort of like the division is our country today.

                Slightly more than a “portion” of the French Navy.
The Brits were having to fight the French, Spanish and Dutch as well as the Revolutionary Army; it’s almost surprising that they didn’t lose sooner.

                The American rebels won the war only when the British Parliament grew weary of funding the fight against them. It was not the money- the British had the world’s largest military and nearly unlimited resources- but like LBJ, Nixon, and the American congress during Viet Nam, they gave up on a war that the military was fully capable of winning if allowed to.

        However, don´t forget to make sure none of your new libertarian friends rats on you. And not, it´s not my pure malice speaking. I have had a strong impression for some time that a major part of remaining libertarians are a classical controlled opposition, given a platform where even a slightly “alt-rightish” or even a conventional right-wing voice would long be extinguished by SJWs. But, where there is an artificially nurtured fake dissent the next small step is plain and banal espionage. For instance, actual deeds (not rhetoric, anyone can fake that) of persons like Rand Paul smell of a mole quite distinctly. What he does is play a principled right-winger of the “all-or-nothing” type to undermine any nascent compromise that could forward some real life right wing agenda. And, since most Americans (excepting Jews) are incurably credulous and susceptible to whatever moral high ground pep talk is being thrown at them, the old trick works again and again, unfortunately.

        Zman thanks for the awesome &amp; highly amusing report of your adventures in God’s waiting room. Love the way you turn a phrase as others have already mentioned. And the good that came from it. As well as the useful attitude as we work to move ‘our thing’ forward.Work camps… kiddie table… the age thing as fact… all great stuff. I come here to learn. New ‘reputable’ names, history, networking ideas and bad thoughts to keep in mind as the banal evils (bad band name?) try to hold on to power. Looking forward to Part Deux.

        ” ” Having dinner with a gang of smart, like minded professionals is an antidote to the sense of doom ” ”
Glad to hear it. Only met one doctor that was on our side. Turns out he was a major in the National Guard 🙂
Was told the upper class will only get involved when the progressive nonsense affects them.  Sounds like that time has finally come.

        ZMan,  Glad you could attend.  Was on the verge of going too, but it would have been $7-800 + half a day vacation.  Figured I could just donate some of that to key allies then watch or listen to recordings of the main talks.  Hopefully they were recorded.  Looking fwd to hearing your next post.

        Apparently someone tried to start the revolution early, and beat Rand Paul’s ass while he was mowing the lawn at his house the other day. Maybe Lord Fountainhead should move to Michigan and live among his coterie of “Detroit Republicans,” where I’m sure he will be much safer.

        Do you attend this event in disguise, that is using a fake name or your blogging nom de plume?  You talk about getting to know people IRL – but how many of you guys are still using pseudonyms at these events?   I realize the threat of doxing is real, so no complaints if you are, but I am just curious.

            Two or three years ago a very nice well spoken woman, a high ranking administrator in Detroit government, spoke for you, saying that in spite of the wretched conditions in which natives live there, they place a greater value on not having to endure the day to day self-judgement that comes from living around white people.  We are listening to your pain.
