        I think it may have been another Zman post where I saw someone with the title “extremism researcher.”  I thought man, in a better world that would be such a kick ass job.  Traveling around the world looking for the roughest rapids, the highest mountains, the most insane cliffs to dive, biggest waves to surf.  The title would carry both envy and respect.

        Love how the polemical cliche was inverted at the end— “Death By a Thousand Lies” sounds like something WFB Jr. would publish in 1965, based primarily on a few lines of Cicerolock he caught in a bar (the sound was turned, but he thinks he got the gist). Today there are Conservatism Inc. interns who do this same ConGPT shtick every day… It used to pay for an apartment in D.C., I’ve heard. Of course that living situation was in the Before Times, when the Blond Road Warrior had not invaded with his disrespectful, funny, righteous lies about crowd size. Truly the artist of machine-gun lying, that one.

        This all sounds well and good until you start wondering where the memes are coming from.
Given the prevalence of alt-right and dissident meme-war influencers who are suspected of being or outed as Feds, we can suspect the memes might be government propaganda too. Throw in their love of the Q psyop and Trump’s January 6th honeypot…
Or were you really naive enough to think 4chan was an organic place to hang out?

            4chan was never a good or true thing, but it wasn’t always dead.But one day, the owner started Gamergate (roundaboutly causing the “Brexit and Trump” phenomenon) by banning discussion of an obscure nerd beef, probably as a favor to his shitlib girlfriend. It was already banned everywhere big except Reddit, who’d get around to banning everything eventually—but 4chan caved *immediately*. Once that seal was opened, the end was inevitable.Between that fateful day and ~2017, anon could still invent the draft-our-daughters Hillary ads, the real-life NPC, “It’s OK to be white,” “Islam is right about women,” etc. Some instantly spottable differences between those memes and fed fakes: nobody claims or gives credit for inventing them, there’s no honeypot URL on the signs/stickers/pics, and they weren’t first seen on Twitter.Then on one later day that nobody noticed, nothing but the occasional innovative slur came from 4chan anymore. It took a while, and who knows how many unofficial ownership/management changes, but eventually they figured out how to kill it.It’s different.

        Here’s an interesting comment from an article at WRSA:
“Look up “Synthetic Environment for Analysis and Simulations” (SEAS) and “Sentient World Simulation” (SWS). These were used by the military industrial complex. SWS has been live since 2007 and is being used to build a synthetic mirror of the real world with automated continuous calibration with respect to current real-world information, such as major events, opinion polls, demographic statistics, economic reports, and shifts in trends. It is also creating a digital map of our environment and our bodies. The internet of things and the internet of bodies.”

        In my adult life I was never much of a TV watcher, and I have a suspicion this is a key part of how I ended up on the DR. One becomes much more susceptible to propaganda and mind programming the more one watches TV. It doesn’t get you the same way in print. I didn’t understand this back then, I just didn’t watch much TV (other than sportsball) because I didn’t care for much of what was on and had other things I’d rather do. But I am certain this is a factor in how quickly and readily one embraces the Current Thing. Moreover, I do not consider myself immune. Were I to plug back in to the idiot box, I have little doubt that over time it would go to work on my mind and make me more susceptible. A person doesn’t get programmed by it overnight, and they don’t deprogram overnight either. It takes some time away from the propaganda tube before something like sanity begins to return. Watching one TV show isn’t going to make you a slave to the system, and turning it off for one day isn’t going to liberate you.At some point, avoiding TV became a conscious decision, not just a habit. And some time after that, several years, was when I began to “qualify” as someone who inhabits the DR. What I’m getting at is, it’s hard to shake off the programming instantly.  Nowadays, on those rare occasions when I see TV, it’s like something I once saw in a dystopian sci fi movie.I suspect this is a key factor in why some quickly embrace Chicago Jesus, or Russian disinfo, or masks, or jabs, or Slava Ukraini, or whatever the Current Thing is, and others don’t. Their minds were already prepped and programmed for it by years, decades of the idiot box. High IQ does not appear to be a defense against this kind of mental conditioning. Some people with high IQ fall prey to it and others don’t. The only defense is not to be plugged in.But then I think back to my late teens, in the 1980s, and I was already calling the newspaper the “propaganda leaflet.” So maybe the journey to the DR wasn’t really such a long one for me intellectually, even if it took 3 more decades to really manifest.

            My experience with the idiot box is almost identical with yours, and I agree with your conclusions. I would note, however, that nowadays there are other screens–computer and sail foam, primarily–that compete with the boob toob. I’m not sure if these newer conduits for agitprop simply fracture screen viewership or augment it. But if the latter, it is even more difficult to withdraw from Big Poz now than ever before.

            Jeffrey Zoar:  Same experience although a bit earlier for me.  I watched standard tv shows as a child in the ’60s, but less than most of my friends.  By junior high I was already turning it off and kicking my younger sister outside to play.  I watched original Star Trek reruns in high school (never watched it when it first aired) and by college in the late ’70s I loaned my rarely-used portable tv to friends to watch the Olympics because I already didn’t give a damn.Name any hit tv show of the ’80s  or later and I can honestly say I’ve never seen a single episode.  Same for movies.  I know of them from general reading and other people, but I was unplugged decades ago myself.Took me a bit longer to shake off my liberal upbringing with regards to newsprint, but I was more than ready for the dissident right by the time I found it via internet reading in the early 2000s and onward.

            I get stuck watching the evening news when I visit my dad, and the funny thing is that the regime propaganda isn’t particularly convincing or clever.  This social media injunction was discussed on PBS, and they had some yenta professor to explain why it was bad.  Thing is she just babbled and equivocated without saying much of anything or really making a point, in that motormouth kibbutzing style like the little goblin Ben Shapiro.  No persuasion, logic, or even just using a good-looking person to deliver the message.All the regime really has is the ability to make their narrative relentless and omnipresent.  They only convince because the slugs can’t move away from their televisions, and every channel is telling them the same story.

            Growing up I’d say TV was the main thing that gave me a sense of being a part of an actual culture. I still recall how the TV schedule came as a little printed booklet inside the Sunday paper (The Baltimore Sun). I recall my father often demanding “where’s the schedule!?!” after he’d get home from work. Then we really would often gather around the glowing box and watch some of those shows that became 70s and 80s classics. If you were up late enough there was the 11 o’clock news and then Johhny Carson or Letterman. The whole thing sort of provided a structure to the day somewhat like I imagine the various prayers and chants must have in the old monasteries.I continued to watch a few things like Star Trek TNG and the Simpsons into the 2000s. By then it was mainly so I could bullshit with the guys at work the next day about whatever crazy thing Bart was doing or Deanna Troi’s latest slutty outfit. Then it all just sort of… ended. Now I just watch YouTube videos but I don’t really expect anyone to know about the ones I watch.Of course the Age of TV was all about propaganda of a sort but the end of it probably also marked the end of anything resembling a common culture. The US was always somewhat disunified even at the start of the TV era and TV culture probably kept it going after what should have been the fatal divisions of the 1960s. The chaos we see now may simply be a much delayed cultural fracturing that probably would have happened in the 1970s or 80s without the glue of TV culture to create the illusion of a nation.

            Yeah after many years of no television, i moved in with my dad temporarily during lockdowns in 2020 and watched tv with him.  Im amazed at all the commercials they slam people with.  It takes three hours to see a ninety minute movie with all the commercials.  Theyre hammering these boomers with drug and supplement or class action lawsuit commercials now.  I cant help but think at least the internet allows you to watch or read what you want uninterrupted.I think thats why (((they))) are so aggressively pushing culture as extreme to the left as possible.  They know the internet is still relatively free, and free spaces allow the truth to be told.

        The term “expert” is used in lieu of actual expertise.  Expert is a label you can throw around that has no definition, no sanctioning body and no credentials.  It’s like the word “green,” but for people.  if someone presents a person to you as an “expert” who is to say she’s not an expert?  Do you call the “board of experts” and ask if she’s a member?  “Expert” as it is used in this context is just a fake and gay credential substitute issued by nobody because it sounds good.

                Communications or journalism or hate whitey with a minor in mashed potatoes or women’s studies.  Think of all the “climate change experts” on TV and in the newspapers who have never taken a class on atmospheric chemistry or even basic chemistry.  Or god help us, all of the gender experts making the rounds on TV, cable, internet and newspapers. Their “expertise” lies in the fact that they themselves are degenerate weirdos.  Generally they are activists posing as journalists “reporting” on subjects they know nothing about.

                    A great deal of my current religious thought comes from an interview by a scientist who stated, “fewer than five percent of the so-called ‘climate change scientists’ knows anything at all about thermo-dynamics.”
Their ignorance disgusted him.They weren’t interested in the basic questions or consequences of what they insisted on talking about, only the limelight and perks.
Onlyfans, the university version.

        The American version of Gleichschaltung/ coordination between media and state is the epitome of the idea of being a victim of your own success. Once it became clear their control was total and their message unified, it became much easier to find out the truth. If the unified front says the vaccine is safe and effective, you can be reasonably certain that it is dangerous and ineffective. If they say Ukraine is winning the War and Russia is on the verge of collapse, you can be fairly sure Ukraine is getting demolished and the Ruble is doing very well. If the 2016 election was hacked and the 2020 election was the most secure in history….You get the idea.Our rulers don’t always have time or the inclination to integrate the smalltime local news services into their Borg, so if the fat guy in the polyester suit tells you it’s going to rain today, it very well might. You also get coverage of black-on-everybody-else crimes on the local news for the same reason, rather than man-bites-dog stories of saintly blacks being picked off by baby boomers. If the people in charge were smarter and less crazy, they would disseminate multiple and conflicting lies so we wouldn’t be able to tell what their exact intent was. Their “megaphone,” as Steve Sailer called it, is their Achilles heel.It’s a behemoth all right, with such a pathetically slow turn radius that us troglodytes are able to navigate around it easy. Asymmetry is sort of fun for the small guy sometimes. It’s fun to watch this big monster wail and writhe and die the death of a thousand cuts every day. More than likely they already have the 2024 election sewn up for the California Patrick Bateman clone, but I’ll still cast for Trump on the remote chance he can win. I want to see their heads explode

            On the topic you brought up, I relish Z’s idea that the GOP will find a way to pull Trump from the GOP ballot as I’m sure Trump will cook up a scheme to sell stamps so that people won’t even have to write his name in (“$5 a piece, or 5 for $20, order them for the whole family!!”)

            The Big City paper had a Sunday spread about US Intelligence confirming that Covid 19 did NOT come from Wuhans’s bio-weapons lab.  No siree!  No way.The lie astounds.  The nature of the virus had all the hallmarks of an engineered bug.  Have the Chinese purchased that much influence, or are Deep State actors so culpable for the creation of Covid that they keep telling such a risible lie in the face of all evidence?Like you say: Just assume everything is a lie and you’ll be closer to the truth.  That would have been crazy crank-talk twenty years ago, but nowadays, it’s a sensible attitude.

Btw, on topic, I have yet to talk with a single person, even those locked in on anti-regime sources, who is aware of what is happening in France.

            Feeling heard probably means be as loud and annoying as possible unless you’re on the right then they’ll call the cops on you.

            Yeah, I asked a neighbor if her daughter had been checking in with a friend who’s on a school trip to France. She asked me why. I said, “Well, because of all the riots. They’ve been happening all across France for a week.”
“What riots?” she replied.
That’s power.

                Citizen:  Husband’s coworker, wife, and two teen kids merrily embarked on a train trip across Europe a week ago – definitely including France.  These people are generally oblivious of anything not reported by the state media, and regard my husband as a bit of a ‘right winger’ (if only they knew).  I truly wonder if they’ll notice all the brown and black faces in Europe, and how much the tourism agencies are able to shelter visitors from racial reality.  While I don’t wish them any physical harm, I’d love to see them smacked in the face by what’s actually happening in the world.

        The character, Handsome Truth, has received much attention lately for spreading information pointing out that there is one group who essentially control everything.  He and his guys do things like distribute flyers in plastic baggies on driveways throughout neighborhoods, hang banners over freeways, and gather at busy intersections, with signs and a megaphone.Because of their actions, news reports on local stations express grave concern over “hate.” (they never show what information the flyers contain–it’s just “hate.”)  Rolling Stone magazine ran a disapproving feature on Handsome Truth and Ron DeSantis signing an anti-free speech bill, making spreading information like this a felony.  DeSantis signed the bill in Israel, which I think is significant, by the way.HT’s antics are controversial even for those on our side.  You can argue that he’s playing the role of the villain that the left crave, the cartoon Nazi perhaps, including accelerating the clampdown on free speech.  On the other hand he’s spreading information, gaining a following of young people and calling out the Empire’s lies very rapidly.Handsome Truth live streams a few times per week.  One of the segments is where he uses Omegle, which is where young people, on camera, talk to others who they connect with randomly.  HT is an actor, and has an arsenal of different characters he goes in and out of through the use of a face filter, including a gay character, which draws a lot of attention.  He uses a lot of words that are shocking to people, and not allowed in polite company, to put it mildly.Once he has the young person’s attention, he informs them about the group that’s in control of everything.  One of the first questions he asks is, “Do you trust the media?”  Every time, and I mean every time, the person says “no,” with zero hesitation.

            One of my favorite moments from the 2016 Trump rally I attended was when Trump pointed out the Press at the back of the hall and said “See those people back there?  They are the worst people ever!  The worst!”  Much cheering.

        Even Jen Psaki’s 4 year old child called her a wicked fool. She thought it was a cute little story to tell the world. She was and is one of the biggest believers in eliminating free speech and debate in favor of a tyrannical and mandated belief-system. She’s probably also the one who told Joe Biden to threat-whisper at people as a winning strategy, it’s probably how she treats her own child and it was creepy and didn’t work then, either. Doh!Anyway, it’s no surprise that the judge specifically called her out as one of the worst offenders.So, she can’t even her fool her own 4 year old child, yet she demands we believe her and her clan’s wicked and foolish lies.We’re speeding to Armageddon while these wicked fools are hitting the gas playing some kind of flipped-out Dr. Spock experiment on how to win friends and influence people by threatening them with whispers and trying to put Putin in Xi in the time-out corner like children.The only thing I can think that is happening is that these people are all micro-dosing and we’re stuck in the room with them while they are tripping balls while telling us that they aren’t that high and they know what they are doing.

        Two inspirational stories were recently suppressed on (read: by) the only still freely accessible alternative info dump, 4chan—and therefore they were suppressed everywhere, because the “content” of the internet is whatever 4chan decides it is. The process by which that decision is reached is now literally fake and gay.The first story was a burgeoning sequel to “Gamergate,” equally inexplicable to non-dorks and equally alarming to the fraction of the establishment that understood its memetic significance.Shortly before a supposedly controversial Harry Potter game was released, the infamous “Twitter trannies” (actual) launched a harassment campaign against female “vtubers” (game streamers with cartoon avatars) who showed interest in playing it. This attack on the closest thing to real-life anime girls of course sent all the relevant 4chan boards into a TOTAL TRANNY DEATH spiral. Then suddenly it went away, because discussion of what the Twitter trannies were doing was banned. Moderators dispatched it from every board and banned everyone who talked about it the wrong way. It’s /pol/ material so it can’t be on /v/ and also it’s not /pol/ so it can’t be on /pol/, etc., until nothing else happened. They still kill threads that drift into the subject.If at that moment of already heightened troon hate, normalfags (normies call them normies) had seen the crazed threats the hormone psychos were sending to little girls and making them cry… But—crisis averted.Second story: During a recent some-degree-of-staged fight between Proud Boy feds and Patriot Front feds, a PFer was unmasked. /pol/ instantly identified him as a junior glowie from a Jews-only fraternity. Many threads were deleted because it was a happening and there were too many threads. The chosen remnant were flooded, botted, brigaded, slid, saged, etc., until nothing else happened. If you’ve heard about it, you’ve heard that it’s deboonked and the 4chan autists for once misidentified the guy. They did not.So, as ever, 4chan is kill. But this time it really is. The worst part of the new censorship regime is that even anon has been trained, finally, to revel in it. Posts about Pikamee’s ruined graduation celebration are met with, among the other stock responses, “enjoy your ban.” That’s why some of those words meant nothing to you.

            The singularity? It happened? Real life and the internet merged via 4chan and now we’re living in it? That actually makes the most sense to explain what has happened to the world recently because this stuff is off the chain; chest-feeding men, really!? Lol We can’t say we weren’t warned. The last thing everyone says to anyone first learning about 4chan is, “but don’t go there”. But now, even if you don’t go there it comes to you in real life. Witness we just had a month of ‘Pride’ with the so very chanish White House antics. Just amazing. Anyway…We are living in a 4chan singularity trolling operation, people! 🙂

        I once worked for a company that was in the business of rolling up other companies, I was designated the “ expert” of a particular segment of the company. Never mind that under me the company was busy getting rid of  employees capable of helping me succeed in my role as the “expert”.This is America now under our managerial elite, a ton of “ experts” that oversee a system that is a mile wide with experts but an inch deep in competence to hold up the “ experts” and the system they manage.

                It’s funny because there are real experts, though we don’t usually call them that.   We now use the term “expert” to describe someone who doesn’t have any real expertise.  An automotive expert is a made up title that means absolutely nothing. The most likely person to use that label is a journalist.   A real automotive  expert is an engineer working in design or production and a member of the SAE.

        “People living in a world of lies are not going to trust the system and they are certainly not going to trust the people who are responsible for the world of lies.”Indeed.I’ll expound upon a recent experience that I alluded to in a comment the other day. On the way back from the airport, my family and I got a cab back to our house. I had a conversation with the cab driver which was quite pleasant.The driver informed me that he no longer read any newspaper or consumed any other legacy media. This was a new thing for him, but as a cab driver, he mentioned that he saw “the other side” to the pretty diversity picture painted by our upper-crust. Even the “right-wing” newspapers didn’t cover the obviously problematic things that our new “Englishmen” were doing. It seems as though being a taxi driver is a good education in race realities.But I remember thinking “good for you” because, while easy for us here to harp on about, disconnecting from media you’ve trusted all your life is a very positive step. It shouldn’t be underestimated. It will lead to even more distrust of the system, which is only a good thing, on the net.

            There are a lot of murmurings of a “Great Turning Away” which is pointing towards a post-political future due to disillusionment with our democratic system. It isn’t as much a fight against the system as a malaise that chooses to avoid the system when possible and to submit when there’s no way to avoid it. Soon the average person’s view of government will be the same as a Chinese citizen, with a small fanatical sect of true believers in the inner party.The question will be whether the amount of wasted energy used on our side in democratic processes will go towards more useful activities.

                The Chinese are much more hierarchical than us. While our egalitarian streak has lately been used against us, it’ll also be the saving grace when politics and authority break down. Enough people will decide, I don’t need you, I can do it myself.

        I reckon we’re right on schedule for a credentialed, professional disinformation researcher; Lord have mercy, we already have Happiness Officers, Heads of Product and Innovation, Diversity Chiefs, Talent Officers. I see no reason the Evil won’t continue.At least in the West, we have a phenomenal problem with simplytoo many people. They need work, and that work is make-work. I’m thinking of almost all levels of management; these people direct the work of the technically competent below them and pump up their resumes by doing so. Note that, even though I tend to fall firmly in the camp of an engineer, this doesn’t mean that my job isn’t also make-work… I believe it is!My current company, the amount of make-work – both of a technical nature and of a managerial nature – is simply staggering. I’m talking about vanity projects to migrate on-premises applications to the cloud. And then additional projects to migrate from one cloud architecture to another one; because “industry best practice”. I have no doubt that the same idiocy exists in all engineering fields: software, network, mechanical, civil, naval, aeronautical – things that just don’t need to be done, but will be done because “new-and-shiny” and “investment” and “growth”. It really is quite tiresome.

            “I’m talking about vanity projects to migrate on-premises applications to the cloud.”
Heh, heh.  Just this morning, before reading this post, I led a meeting, as a manager, for a customer migrating our services from on premisis to the cloud.
For most of my career, I was a software engineer, but I got tired of working so hard, so now I am a manager.  I don’t think that my work is without value, but it would not exist without the work of the engineers.

                Another Guy,Heh. Warning! Your job could be make-work!In all seriousness, at least youwerea software engineer. And now that you are a manager, I presume it is a manager of software engineers and similar folks? This is a different breed or manager entirely, and, if managers are needed at all, is the right way to do things.A lot of hubbub is made about the “Soft Skills” in management, which to some extent have their place; hence why so often I find myself dealing with a new manager with no technical background. But: technical know-how is key to being a good technical manager. You need to be able to estimate time scales for “deliverables”, to reason about priorities regarding high-severity outages and understand technical decisions – and I’m not sure many “new-age” managers have this.Look at organizations like General Motors, Lockheed Martin or NASA 60 years ago or more – safe bet that all the managers and higher-ups were engineers or financial men.Good luck with the migration! Wait just two years and somebody else will tell you: it needs to be re-written! It must be hosted in Docker containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes! It needs to go back to on-prem! It must be able to feed my pet rat.God bless you.

            Well put OrangeFrog.VP Customer SuccessVP of PeopleChief People OfficerDirector of HappinessPrinciple DreamerChief Space OfficerI agree that even in engineering there are a bunch of made-up projects. There is a balance. You don’t want to be an airline running twenty layers of databases around forty other different databases. At the same time, despite what we are told, there are probably far too many software engineers whose perfectly healthy ambitions and creativity has no viable outlet other than the latest refactor of dubious utility, or a port to some new same-features-different-authors middleware that justifies projects and rewards. Some do have value, but it is difficult to understand often times.Then there is the absurd interview gauntlet that is contradicted by the diversity hire mandates.This all feeds back into the Big Lie used to justify the mass immigration. If we were ruled by serious people, like us, we could fix the problem of any so-called labor shortage immediately. We would use the power of the government not to monitor social media posts, but to find every person in the country illegally working, green card or not, and deport them. The wall would be built and we would have our military and armies of drones patrol and enforce its boundaries with a violent detterrance and punishment. Illegal crossers will be killed on sight.We would use the printing press to cover for this. Then we would dismantle all of the subsidies for foundations, NGOs, and furlough the entire bureaucracy. We would defund universities except for STEM departments. Arts and Letters would be suspended and a project to reconstitute them would begin once Men of The West with a classical learning could be assembled to begin a re-build. Entry into those disciplines would be severely limited. The welfare state would be bolstered for the time being.There would be massive unemployment. We would find out how many masses of people are parasites and how big of a surplus of labor exists in this country that can be filled from within our borders. At the same time the deportations would be done in an orderly way. A sinecure who is a citizen will be placed in one of the non-American’s jobs and trained Then the replacee would be deported. Consider that restitution for our people training their replacements in years past.The Disinformation Specialist would now pick the lettuce. Daytron would not sell crack in bulk twice a month to welfare check cashers. He would clean the slaughterhouse. Any transition-to-productive-work candidate who refuses the offer will be deported. We won’t have the money for mass incarceration. If they can’t be deported, they will face an existential decision. The entire DIE/HR cadre will be limited to working only the most humble, menial and dirty of jobs.We need to liquidate the vast army of sinecures. The Fed and FDR’s make-work state have been an utter catastrophe for this country.One other important thing a serious regime will do. It will not abandon education and training for its people and just import technical helots from abroad. It will make a full investment in developing its people – not from an egalitarian premise, but by selection based upon clearly demonstrated capacity and ability.

        It is exponentially more ludicrous for a government — ANY government — to launch a campaign against disinformation than it would be for the mafia to declare war on racketeering. It’s immeasurably more asinine than prostitutes claiming to favor abstinence. The entire business of modern rulership requires an endless flow of disinformation. If on some random Monday, a government ceased altogether drowning the public in disinformation, that government would be overthrown no later than Thursday of the same week. Disinfo is the very LIFEBLOOD of the system. That our system pretends to fight tooth-and-nail against such disinfo only further demonstrates what a farcical self-caricature the system has become. But we already knew that, didn’t we? It’s taking so many others a lot longer to catch up.

        I am becoming more convinced a big portion of the difficultly employers are having in getting their companies staffed is made up nonsense jobs like the ones you mention here.  Between this, DIE garbage and social media influencers how many millions of people are in jobs that have no practical benefit to anyone?  The problem of course is even if most of it went away, the majority of these people are now unemployable in any meaningful and important role in a company.

            There is just a lack of white men in general, as Boomers retire there aren’t enough to replace them, plus millions are on drugs or dropped out of society.

                    The term company man is quite ancient. I think it probably originated as a derisive label by union workers for fellow workers who refused to join the union. If so, the term likely dates from the 1880s or so.

                Even medium-sized companies (&lt;1000 employees) have gotten corporatized. I have worked for a few. DEI is trickling down. Even the older guys in management are trying their best to stay relevant and adopt the latest ideological jargon of the managerial class.
Just the other day we got a DEI insert into our Values Statement. The boss explained it as if our company had an spectre of disinclusion and intolerance haunting the office space, ready to pounce on an unsuspecting employee.

                B125:  If my husband had not gotten a job in a small, privately-owned company (now a much larger but still privately-owned company) when he left the government, there is no way he’d still be employed.  Although they’ve brought in a bit of diversity, the owner and managers are all White men.  God knows what will happen when the owner dies – vague talks of profit-sharing and senior employees owning the company have gone nowhere.

Whomever would dominate the System must find work for all these camp followers.This, in a nutshell, explains the revulsion of the media to RFK Jr. He is more threatening to them than Trump, because at least Trump employs thousands of media-whore types who are deemed necessary to counteract him.So “Disinformation Management” is the new HR. It’s yet another layer of overhead loaded on top of the tiring System’s back. The next decade will be all about testing the outer limits of System durability, with Reparations being the next load of overhead.

        “People living in a world of lies are not going to trust the system and they are certainly not going to trust the people who are responsible for the world of lies. They will seek out alternatives.”You might be dismayed by the the large percentage of people who do buy into the regime’s lies and the small percentage who do seek out alternatives. Lies and propaganda work. The small percentage who do seek for alternatives have on average a much higher level of cognitive ability and consequently can see through the hollow claims, the false arguments, and the outright inherent contradictions of the regime’s lies.

            It would be flattering to think “noticing” is based on cognitive abilities, but some of the smartest people I know are born-again Covidians, mouth-breathing anti-Trump (Bush II, Bush, Reagan, Ford, Nixon) zealots and card carrying global warming doom-mongers.

                Intelligence in the quantitative and measurable sense, the sense of those who refer to IQ andg, is of no value at all when it comes to actually perceiving reality. It just amounts to a sort of facility at juggling abstractions and making combinations with them, which also happens to be precisely the kind of useless activity that advanced managerial states select for.In fact, these “smart” people can be more broadly, deeply, and thoroughly bamboozled than the average dolt, because they can lie to themselves with more intensity. If one of their trusted authorities tells them some utterly outlandish thing, rather than rejecting it for the nonsense it is, they will dream up some farfetched scenario under which it might plausibly be true, and then convince themselves that the narrative is reality, because it must be. As thinkers, their only consistency is in the “Who/Whom?”, never in the “What?”.Unfortunately, this sort of vulnerability is evenly distributed across the political spectrum and knows no boundaries of right or left, mainstream or alternative. There are even plenty of “Dissident” thinkers who are really nothing more than IYIs at heart and and have no ability to think critically about the information presented to them. They even admit as much with their whole “red pill” meme. If they had been sound judgers of reality to begin with, they would not have needed, nor would they have taken, any pill.

            “ The small percentage who do seek for alternatives have on average a much higher level of cognitive ability and consequently can see through the hollow claims, the false arguments, and the outright inherent contradictions of the regime’s lies.”Ali, exactly.  The average person simply is overwhelmed.  It takes a superior intellect to figure out when one is being BS’d.  We call this ability, “critical thinking”.  I certainly am *not* an expert on CT, and I certainly can’t tell you how to develop such a skill—heck, I probably can’t even define it adequately.I just know such is how I traverse the daily universe of misunderstandings, half-truths, and outright lies I am exposed to.  Once you get over the initial depression of realizing just how much BS is being thrown at you through the media, CT can be sort of an entertaining exercise.Z-man seems to have worked this into a second profession even.  My goal in my remaining years is to reach at least half the level of understand Z-man has shown on topics of the day—*before* first reading it here.  Ambitious I admit, but one’s reach should exceed one’s grasp.  😉

            Lies and propaganda work until they don’t. Communist control of information in the USSR was even greater than Leftist control in AINO. And yet, it didn’t take long for most people in the Soviet Union to realize they were being deceived and to seek out and disseminate contrary data and info. The subversives succeeded to such a degree that, by the 1980s, there were very few people who were willing to go to the mat for the USSR. This cynicism and ennui made the country’s collapse much more likely. I imagine something similar is occurring in AINO.

                Yes, you are right. There’s a threshold to lies and propaganda. When the divergence between observed reality and propaganda becomes too blatant, an increasing number of people notice it and become cynical and blase. I’m not sure, though, that the amount of garbage now being churned out is any less than in the Soviet Union.

                    There’s just as much garbage now, perhaps even more. However, there are also more alternative sources of information, and dissidents are not yet being massacred or packed off to labor camps in great numbers. Things are bad and getting worse in AINO in 2023, but it’s still nowhere near as bad as it was in the USSR in 1933.

                Ostei:  Yes and no.  Most people in the Soviet Union knew the official press organs were propaganda, but most people also had no real involvement or interest in politics.  At first they were merely trying to survive.  Later on your average person was more concerned with finding who had gotten a shipment of bananas or had some western jeans for sale.Average Whites (and I deliberately include Slavs here) are average.  They don’t want to run the country and their political opinions touch on what affects them directly.  The Soviet Union didn’t ‘collapse’ because the average person tired of the propaganda; they just wanted more ‘stuff.’Average western Whites are still awash in ‘stuff,’ even after supply chain disruptions and ongoing inflation.  They generally remain oblivious of political reality – they still send their kids to public schools and walk around with their noses in their phones because bad things only happen to bad people in bad neighborhoods.Despite some here reporting green shoots of awareness here and there, I’m not seeing it.  Wish it were so, but all I see is obliviousness.  And yesterday in the nearest Walmart (20 miles away in a 91% White town of about 1350 people) I saw a blowzy White woman with a White boy of about 8 and two younger mulatto spawn in her cart.Reality keeps reinforcing my pessimism, however much I try not to despair.

                    I wasn’t claiming that the cynics caused the USSR to collapse, simply that their total apathy toward the rodina meant that when the tiger slipped the leash there was little to stop it from devouring his owner. Something similar will probably happen in AINO. You don’t have to be a Lenin or a Robespierre to damage the establishment. All you have to do is refuse to lift a finger in its defense.

        This is yet another problem that gets solved by collapse.All the scolds and busybodies that infest the disinformation domain have way too much time on their hands living off the grift, and that idleness is the source of this societal entropy. When the plates stop spinning and Karen can’t afford a latte every 3 hours, she won’t be in Starbucks all afternoon staring at her laptop. More likely she will be dumpster diving for dinner scraps while astounded at how quickly her life went to shit in a heartbeat.Frankly, this is the only viable solution to the dead-weight problem. The environment has to change and reintroduce real hardship across the board. Only then will idleness cease to be a source of misery for so many. Evolution requires that dead-weight terminate in a dead-end.

            Yes, I am gleefully awaiting the day when the Internet goes down permanently. I have already mostly disconnected from it except for this site and a couple others, and no longer watch cable or Internet news programs. I have gone back to books and dvd’s. It’s pretty amazing how little you miss the constant need to check anything online, and the 5G radiation that was slowly frying your brain goes away. I go outside a lot more and am more at peace.

                Turning off the internet is about the last thing the regime ever wants to do. They prefer we stay online watching porn and playing video games, cuckflix, and ordering doordash, plugged into their coordinated propaganda messaging. If they turned it off, we might, heaven forbid, go out into the real world and talk to each other.
Which is a separate question from some degradation over time of the internet through incompetence, and ferals and meth heads stealing all the copper wire

        This post today made me think about “Clown World™️“ has it has manifested across the millennia, and how gullible the masses truly are.I recently read up on the ancient Roman city of Hierapolis. It is famous for being the legendary site of Pluto’s “gateway to Hell”.In much the same way that the Oracle of Delphi has been attributed to gasses being released and creating euphoric hallucinations, Priests WHO WERE LITERALLY TRANNIES would stage rituals at the entrance of a cave where animals would be sacrificed to Pluto. The animals would asphyxiate in the presence of high CO2 emissions from inside the cave entrance, proving that it was a gateway to the underworld. But the tranny priests somehow knew that all they had to do was hold their breath and keep their head high above the low settling gasses to prevent asphyxiating themselves.Crowds of onlookers would witness the ritual in amazement, convinced the Gods were working through these eunuch priests (called Galli) who literally cut off their penises, wore makeup, dressed like women, all in a ritualistic deference to a goddess named Cybele.So even in Roman times, people were duped into worshiping trannies and Carbon Dioxide cults.
