        Most of the “conservatives” like Olsen are genetically predisposed toward liberalism. I believe it is a behavioral condition. These people have deeply held beliefs in things like fairness, honesty, loyalty, tolerance, consideration, politeness, and so on…all the homilies everyone knows about. But beyond these nice guy attributes, they really have no firm philosophical foundations. They can’t discuss issues of race because it wouldn’t be nice, and it might make others uncomfortable. They would never think of protecting their own European civilization from the third world hordes because that “race thing” would not be nice to discuss. In other words, “conservatives” like Olsen are grist for the leftist mills. Lefty knows all their hot buttons and he pushes them gleefully.

            Supplicants is the perfect descriptor for their kind.In war there have always been men who burried themselves in the church pews asking and pleading for the deliverance of all.  Convinced their piety would right all that was wrong.
Beneath all this, hidden in the shadows  even from themselves,  lies cowardice.
Piety in the face of destruction is not piety.  It is a way of avoiding personal risk while convincing oneself of one’s high mindedness.

                Supplicant is a good term. And many of these “conservatives” really do believe that the things we discuss on this forum are immoral. As Zman stated some time ago, we need our own moral compass and should never engage Conservatism, Inc. on their own terms. It would be like trying to teach a cat to bark.

                    Epaminondas, I think you understate the case. To many people, even the mention of “white identity” is no different than the actual act of dragging a black man by a chain around his neck with your pickup truck.

            Epa;There *is* such a foundation for the West.  It’s called Christianity (of the fundamentalist/traditional form).  The mainline churches have gone apostate and so have been taken over by Feminism (the Religion of Nice) starting 100+ years ago.  Once pozzed, their orientation became horizontal, not vertical.  Determined to create heaven in this world, but bringing hell: Sorta like Marxism.  As a result, the mainline churches are withering away before our eyes.  It’s almost like there’s something invisible going on.Traditional Christianity is most emphatically *not* all about blank slate-ism in this world, but rather the next: Equality before God, not before man.  That’s another big part of the apostasy of the mainline churches.  Right up there with the egregious presumption that they can ‘fix’ creation, helping God, if you will.

                Evangelical Christianity is just as globalist, if not yet as homo, as the mainline. Their members lag the trend by a generation, but are quickly falling in line. One can pretend this is not true, but you can’t point to a single major church in the western world, much less the US, where a subsidiary approach to race and nation is widely accepted and/or proffered from the pulpit. Kinnism is a tiny minority of a minority and the largest trad outlets (orthodox and catholic) are 100% globalist post-racial. See also: E. Michael Jones belief that Catholic teaching made Germans smart and can do the same for Gambians with half the average IQ.As Yves pointed out above, those who would pray for deliverance are just unwilling to do otherwise. Nobody is going to pretend Christianity isn’t in European history or that Pagan revivalists will win the day, but those selling the existing churches as salvation are lying to themselves at-best.

                What? I thought foundation for the west is Greco-Roman philosophy
There are 10 million South Korean christian out there praying for their wealth
And South Korea not a bit resemble as European Society
Maybe you should pray harder so democrat drop welfare policy
Why the hell Jesus who didn’t save millions of European people from black plague will save you at this time
pathetic
Just….pathetic
you and white south African deserve to live under negro rule while resource extracted to Chinese and Israel

            Not sure about genetics but the environment produces the nice guy “conservative” in the same way it produces generation after generation of nice guy blue pill beta draft horses that live entirely within the frame of the feminist gynocentric sexual dystopia.A frame based on the truth – be it social animals in politics or female nature in mating, that instructs rational self interest and a mental point of origin of intrinsic self worth and natural masculinity is strangled in the crib.These are males playing the role they have been told will reward them with the good life.A job, wife, kids, house, couple weeks of marriott vacations and the conspicuous costco consumption to signal their compliance with the rules. They are the “happy wife, happy life” guys of politics married to leftistim that, of course, finds them sexually repulsive.What, the script is not working for you? Well work harder, treat her nicer than those badboy brutes, buy nice things, do more chores, get in touch with your feminine side. Worked for me!The “cuck” label sticks for a reason. These are the same males who lecture other men about how to comply with the old set of books while willfully ignoring the observable reality that those rules no longer apply; the males who manipulate the natural inclination of men toward honor and duty, chivalry and service, in order to enslave men to the cult of Progress to get their “atta boy” birthday bj’s from the establishment.When men struggle with the cogdis of living the lie or fail to find fertile ground among the salted plains of leftist rule, these men pound their hollow chests: “man up and marrry that slut.”And human nature inplores them toward extrinsic validation and assuaging the inner conflict of self loathing that leftism demands. So they must smash all crimethought and potential red pill sources. Often more aggressively than the leftoids. Traitorous soldiers are often more brutal in this regard for they know that its Forward or the gallows for them.So don’t be a knuckle dragging racists misogynist. Work harder and one day she will notice you and you will be able to help raise her bastard kids.Genetic leftism is real, but the environment of the femcentric progressive death cult that turns generations of men into soy is the bigger issue.

        Do you ever think that we are the Neanderthals? Not in the old pejorative sense but in the actual sense of Neanderthal DNA lives on mostly in two groups of people, Caucasians and Asians. The only peoples on the globe that have actually made something that’s worth preserving and the higher percentage is among caucasians who are demonstrably  different than every other race on Earth in mentality and looks. Nobody really talks about it because it’s so obviously racist to point out that sub-Saharan Africa’s have no Neanderthal DNA but I feel like that’s our future. A small group of people being overwhelmed by an exodus from Africa but we’re going to live on in the DNA and eventually the ones that have the highest percentage will win the future. I know that’s not very well thought out

            Interesting point; never thought about that.Prior to about 1960 ‘ish, Asia (minus Japan) was a total economic basket case, on par with Latin American economic development , and minus the internecine tribal extermination-of-the-day prevalent in Africa. (but let’s not forget Mao’s policies; 70,000,000 !! died).For whatever reason, things took off, economically, in Asia.Latin America still an economic weenie (check out the % of Latin American nations represented in any international or global index fund; they are almost invisible and would be totally invisible if not for Brazil).Maybe Asians have Denisovan genes in their genetic pool, and perhaps so do Caucasians.Speaking of Asians, ever notice how many you see in major orchestras here and in Europe, as well as soloists (piano, violin, cello, etc), playing Western classical music,  Mozart, et. al.For whatever reason, they chose not to embrace the musical traditions of other cultures (aside from their own).I guess they are not big fans of diversity.

                    The whole continuous incremental improvement was, of course a Western thing: In WWII the UK and  then the US had neither the time nor inclination to start vast new programs (exception, the Bomb) so improving while producing was the order of the day-  Remus’ “good enuff and plenty of it”.Afterward, the Japanese had no alternative but to produce whatever they could with fuck all and then improve.

                What you’ll see in a lot of orchestras is that the bulk of the string section is Asian, but the first and second chairs are usually white. It’s effort vs talent. Talent always wins. I see the same thing in the large engineering firms.

                China has always had a highly developed culture as has Korea and India as well.
There have been wars, collapses and invasions of course but most of Asia is as civilized as the West albeit in a very different manner
The Asian immigrants that ended up in South America would also end up with a very developed culture though Aztec, Maya and Inca stuff is not like ours

            Whitney…..that is a very interesting observation!  My suspicion is long held that before the unraveling- decoding of the double helix, neanderthal DNA would be found in many northern Europeans.  Back in the PTA days, I remember a woman who I swear was half Neanderthal with huge browridge, big boned face, high sloping forehead and big boned muscular body.  She was a dynamo….strong, assertive, lots of leadership dynamics, protective of her kids, strong energy. I have often thought of her and wondered. Considering the African upcoming 4 billion people “camp of saints” by the century end, currently 1.5 billion, will our Euro/Asian DNA get swamped…..will there be pockets of that successful ancestry? Wonder what legacy behavior traits the Neanderthal left in those of us of Northern Euro (Swiss-German-English-Scots-Irish)? A moot point for me as 23 And Me definitely won’t be getting my DNA swab. Do you really trust them with your DNA?

            Drake,  there is no doubt in my mind that the Republicans, conservatives and neverTrumpers are working just as hard at keeping right minded patriots pissed enough to stay home on election day as the Democrat-Communists are at making sure they stuff every ballot box with every sort of fraudulent vote possible and have a ballot cast by every illegal they can get their hands on.  The left is busing in illegals  at a fever pitch to meet their voting goals by 2020.  Keep your eye on Texas and Florida cause that’s where a boat load of tricks are gonna be played.They can’t allow these damn white racists to win another election!

                There won’t need to be an ballot stuffing if Trump has nothing to run on. Boomercons will accept the sloppy thirds after blacks, immigrants, and felons, of tax cuts. But everyone else in the Trump base doesn’t have the money to appreciate tax cuts and views the immigration situation as the ultimate betrayal.

        The professional conservatives come from the same one-party state universities as the hard leftists do. They’re deeply affected by it, knowingly or otherwise.“Educated” conservatives have simply been conditioned to believe that the leftists are going to win, are unassailable, and will inevitably win the future. It’s what they’ve seen on campus, it’s what they see in the mainstream media, it’s what they see in the legal system, it’s what they see in Hollywood, and it’s fulfilling itself thanks to their acquiescence.The time to fight was 40 years ago when there was still a chance to keep the far left from taking over our campuses. No one believed that what happened on campus affected them, so why worry about what a bunch of stupid kids are doing. They’ll surely grow up eventually.Those kids didn’t grow up. Their spawn have taken over government. And now 40 years later it’s dawning on non-mainstream conservatives that they need to be opposed.That ship sailed folks.

            Yes, perhaps the ship has sailed.  However, there still remains one last duty.  Churchill said it best:“If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may be even a worse fate, you may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.”So black pill all you want, it makes no difference.  Here we stand.

                    Churchill’s great failure was that he didn’t realize the price the USA would exact for the destruction of Britain’s German rival would be the destruction of the British Empire itself.
Churchill’s actions hastened the demise of the UK as a world power, but he was far from a cuckservative.  If anything, he was an aggressive warmonger… who didn’t realize the true weakness of the hand he was playing.

                Yes. I don’t think this fatalistic, “We’re doomed to failure, so why do anything” approach is one we should adopt. Even if the odds are against us, to simply roll over is just unacceptable. There are many things we can do, so at least we can be exterminated with honor and dignity, if that is our fate (a belief I’m not sure to be valid).  I for one could not simply give up and die. I know some tremendous individuals who have decided to scuttle off to places such as the Adriatic coast or El Salvador and spend the last days drinking wine in old villas. But if we all elect that option ….. does nothing have value?  Are honor and virtue extinct?

        Why does DR3 fail?  Because cons misunderstand what the left really wants.
Z emphasizes that the cons have the same morality as the left, or what cons believe is their morality.  Cons advocate a society where each person is judged as an individual.  This belief leads cons to make their primary means of argument with the left that conservatism is a more effective means for realizing this vision.
Cons must ask why these arguments fail so spectacularly.  The real goal of the left is to overthrow traditional white America and DR3 arguments do not change that goal.

            DR3 doesn’t work because it reifies the left narrative and since they control the narrative, the momentary issues of one problem spot (eg. DNC Cali bigman Ed Buck raping and murdering black prostitutes with crystal meth) can be papered over with appeals to the broader narrative against whites generally and cons in particular.
Incidentally, calling the left anti-white is rhetorically similar and much more effective because it isn’t in their narrative and they knee-jerk to triumphalist ghoulish taunting without regard to their audience.

            If you look back to 2010, note how much money the Chamber threw into the election spending for the GOP. That number, despite inflation, has never been exceeded in the two successive midterms. The ordinary conservative is so weak they won’t notice this, as long as that 401k goes up. Until it is confiscated for reparations…

And that’s why I (as well as Roger Simon @ PJmedia) would support Bernie for president. They are all exemplars of what the far left does and wants, and as such they’re useful examples to show to the normies, to show them how far out crazy the Left is.The worse, the better.In any case, I don’t think Bernie could win.

                And those two show what the future of the Democratic Party is going to look like.  We’ve had a lot of craziness over the last 25 years, but importing enough Somalis into Minnesota to elect Omar may take the cake.  It goes far beyond not protecting your borders — it’s an active measure rather than passive neglect.

            I would argue this is backfiring already. Trump seems to believe he has a far left that will be easy to defeat. He is pivoting hard to the GOPe for moderate appeal and it’s driving his blue dogs out into stay-home territory without attracting any moderate liberals. The latter still reside on the orange man bad plantation and are not deathly afraid of socialism per se.
Boomercons are very likely to learn in 2020 that poorer younger whites than themselves will choose a mulatto socialist over a white guy running on broken promises.

                    Well why not?  “Climate change” really IS the main issue: the economic “climate” of America has “changed” from a climate of industrial production and innovation to a climate of usury, arbitrage, and financial extortion; the societal “climate” has changed from upstanding White Christian people, formerly known as “Americans,” to a climate of babbling soyboys, screeching xirls, ooking rape-apes, scheming war-mongering genocidal Jews, mooching mystery meat, baby-spewing greaseblobs and insectoid Asian robots; the educational ” climate” has changed from rational inquiry to propaganda and flat-out lies; the sexual “climate” has changed from boy meets girl to soyboy cuts his dick off and girl meets rape-apes followed by box wine and a cat collection; the cultural climate has changed from Cole Porter to coal-burner.Yeah I’d say the climate has changed rather a lot.  By all means, let us name “climate change” as the main threat to America.

        Go deeper. Men (and I use the word loosely here) like Olsen are congenitally weak and can only survive in the artificial world of faux academia in which hive-minded conformism is financially rewarded. In the environment of our ancestral adaption, he would have be killed and eaten long before he could reproduce. We are descended from anit-Olsens. His current presence is a pathologic infection in our heritage.

        This is more on the general topic, if Omar wasn’t an America-hating foreign subversive I’d love her.  She is playing this brilliantly.  She pointed out the obvious fact that America’s support for Israel is bought and paid for by the men-in-tiny-hats donor network centered around AIPAC.  Then the howls of antisemitism came, and her response was “I should not have to be loyal to Israel to prove I’m loyal to the United States.”  Perfect response.  She’s staying on the attack, accusing the detractors of disloyalty.

        Close to thirty years ago, Bill James, the inventor of sabermetrics, had an article in his yearly Abstract on Chuck Tanner and the cocaine scandal affecting so many of the Pittsburgh Pirates when he was the manager. James conclusion was regarding the high opinion so many baseball people had about Mr. Tanner. He was such a doggone nice guy. James realized that being nice, especially in the face of serious issues, was worse than useless.This is the problem with White Guy Inc. From about 1950-1980 it seemed we could afford to be nice to everyone. Turned out that was incorrect. Being perpetually nice in the best of times is a liability, in times like these it is potentially fatal. If Leo Durocher is correct, white people are going to find out what finishing last feels like very soon. I hope it doesn’t look like South Africa every where.

            Ro;Actually it’s a religion: The Religion of Nice.  It was taught in the Mainline Protestant (at least) churches over the time period you mentioned. I was there and saw it, but not clearly enough at that time.  While questionable on a biblical basis, it seemed harmless enough then.  Turned out it was all about eating up the socio-cultural design margin, though.  Wormtongue for sure.

                I agree. I think it stems from woman basically taking over family life. Nothing is more important to woman than everyone getting along, even if part of the everyone wants to destroy your culture. I saw it in the church I grew up in. Eventually feminists men took over and everything fell apart.

        “To be even fairer, Mr. Olsen is probably a great guy. That’s something you can’t help but notice with Conservative Inc.” – I disagree on this point.Mr. Olsen is not a nice guy.  Just because you aim to please your hosts does not make you a nice guy.  I know how these people are.  Mr. King would obviously not consider this man to be a nice guy.A man can’t be separated by his work.  If his work is fundamentally dishonest then he is fundamentally dishonest.  This is why I always seem to hit it off with guys in the trades, even though I wouldn’t know which end of a hammer to use.  It’s fundamentally honest work.  An electrician either leaves with the power lines energized, or her fails.  A plumber either leaves a house with unclogged pipes and working faucets, or he fails, etc., those jobs don’t allow for bullshitting and the people doing them are not used to shoveling bullshit, and the jobs rub off on them.Mr. Olsen is fundamentally dishonest because his job is fundamentally dishonest.  It’s a job he chooses to do every day.  They need to be treated like moist towelettes, and abruptly owned at all times, including at cocktail parties and in restaurants.  Having one as a friend would be putting a con-artist into your life, and we should aways be gravitating towards, on-the-level people.

        That’s “conservatism’s” fatal flaw — we have jobs, families, hobbies.  That’s a tired old joke, I know, but it’s true for all that — when playing politics, people whose lives aren’t 100% politics will always lose to those whose livesare100% politics.  To expect Normals to triumph against the Left is like expecting the co-rec beer league slow pitch softball champs to beat the New York Yankees.  Note that the Yankees not only win at baseball, they win at slow-pitch softball, too, because their entire lives are spent training to hit balls with sticks.  It’s why Conquest’s Law applies: “All institutions not explicitly right wing become left wing.”  I used to joke about bringing back the Inquisition.  I’m really not joking now.  Either the Normals get some full-time professional headbusters — and somehow make that not oxymoronic — or we’ll end up with some full-time amateur headbusters, and then it’s civil war for real.

                The reason Progs take over institutions is largely based on personality. You ask, Don’t Progs also have to work? Sure. Couldn’t real conservatives take jobs are these institutions – government, media, think tanks, etc.? Sure.But think about why soy boys in high school decide to join the student paper while normal guys want to play sports. Progs want to change the world, normies just want to have a good life or maybe build something. Progs gravitate to jobs that give them the ability control people or change society without actually having to build a business while normies hate being people like that and get bored with businesses that don’t do anything, don’t build anything.The media, government, academia, political organizations, etc., will always attract Prog types. Even the the conservative ones will attract Prog-like conservatives like Olsen, men and women who will look to their Prog cousins for guidance. It can’t be helped. It’s a personality thing.

                    That’s it.  Lots of folks on the Right are “work to live” types – doesn’t really matter just what we do for our paycheck, because the paycheck is a means to an end.  Even our “live to work” types find meaning in the job (guys I knew who’d spend 100 hours a week at the their desks had all the rich boy toys, but they’d be just as happy getting paid in subway tokens, provided there was some way to show everyone that they had more subway tokens than the guy at the next desk).  The Left, by contrast, wants to Change the World, so they go into Change the World jobs — government, NGOs, academia.  Even their “work to live” types become the Office Liberal — doing their job always comes second to getting an Employee Code of Conduct put in, or sniffing out forbidden photos in their fellow employees’ cubicles.  Since giving them the Code of Conduct (or whatever) is less time-consuming for the management than fighting the Office Liberal about every single damn thing, pretty soon the entire office is de facto run by the Office Liberal.

                        Sev;Citizen;I agree with everything you say about Progs.  The question is what to do about them in organizations we both inhabit.  I’m suggesting we have to *stop* with the ‘just leave me alone’ mindset.  They’re *not* going to leave us alone for all the reasons you say.I say push back at any opportune* chance to win.  In the Employee Code of Conduct scenario, twist it against the Office Liberal wherever possible.  We know they can’t live up to their own rules.  IOW, once a Prog SJW has surfaced, treat them like the enemy they are.  Be too busy to help them since they don’t understand reciprocity anyway, etc.  None of this, ‘surely if I’m nice they’ll come to understand that we’re all working towards the same goal’ BS.  IOW, create a ‘low trust zone’ around them wherever possible*Opportune chance = above the breakeven line on the ‘Can I win : Will it be worth it’ graph after discounting the ‘worth it’ value.  Deterrence must become a big part of the new ‘worth it’.

                            You have to fight them on their turf. Join the committees that they join and push back. Or use Z-Man jiu jitsu and force them to be specific about policy or force them to admit exactly what they’re trying to do so others realize how fucking crazy these people are.For example, let’s say that they start bitching about lack of diversity in the company, division or office and demand an “initiative” to promote diversity. (Naturally, they’d head up the initiative, right.)You could push back by saying that people in the office are sick of being told they’re racists day in and day out. If this guy wants to quit and make room for a black or Hispanic, he’s more than welcome. So what’s it going to be? Also, where do he expect the company to find all of these qualified black and Hispanic workers?Or the better route is to force him to walk this to its logical, totalitarian end. Say that the company has had initiatives in the past and nothing changed. Demand specifics. “How many blacks, minorities and women do we need by the end of year, in five years, in ten years to be fair? Do we give quotas to managers to fill each year? What’s the punishment for failing to meet that quota? Do we require different qualifications for different races? Do each department need to be the same mix? Does a black woman count twice? Does this quota system go all the way to the top, including VP or partners? If so, what’s the timeline for the very top jobs being the right mix, 5 years, 10 years, I mean, we’re not going to wait forever? Should older, white men employees be asked to retire to make room for blacks and Hispanics. How do Asians fit into all of this?”Then ask him to put that together with his name on it and then we’ll submit to the top brass, specifically the part about changing the top brass.

                    Additionally, those who volunteer to work at an institution have an influence advantage over those who need to be paid; leftists are paid in social currency while those of the right want monetary compensation for their time.
The easiest way to power in any institution is to offer to work for free while becoming more useful than someone who is paid. That’s exactly what internships are for. Those who build without taking are awarded Saintly status, even if they build a monstrosity.

                        This stuff is taught to the Left the best know being the literal Luciferian  text Rules for RadicalsThat said , if we expected to pay our way instead of volunteering  on cheapness we might have some defense against this kind of thingAmerican society has a long standing cheap labor addiction problem, starting with slavery and working its way to the wage arbitrage so bad we haven’t had native fertility above replacement in nearly half a centuryBecause our society was mostly rural and there was vast growth would could get away  with it , most people working the family farm and all that.Now its an 80% urban society and the  the butchers bill has come do , in this case babies not being born and in terms of useful moral people not having time or energy to volunteer leaving us ideological Leftists to do that workI get the fact that a developed urban society is expensive but one that can’t get people to have kids won’t live . This costs moneyIts not a social issue, its not a religious or moral one and there isn’t a single meme that can convince cash strapped normies who can barely make ends meet to have more babiesThe only option we have is mass repatriation and bank regulation  and it might not work noting the fertility rate hasn’t budged since 1973 and the US was almost entirely White till the 90’sRussia as an example has never been able to reach replacement and massive effort including promoting religion has not been able to make a large jump in any nations fertility and not one (Poland, Hungary, Russia) has ever met replacementPutin did better than most but 1.3 to 1.6, the same level as White America is not a victory.I’m only speaking for the US here but I’d guess is that our ideology and culture can’t support higher wages or the high levels of economic regulation required to get them  which means that at best an immigration reform, ban and repatriation can by us a a more pleasant shrinkageThis seems better than the alternative which is importing the dregs of humanity till we run our  society into the ground or run out of dregsSince the only option we have is to try making the nation more homogeneous and less populated to ,get wages up  the Country  Club and its allies need to lose all power for good.If we are very lucky this can be done in an above board, legal way but I’m not sanguine about the odds to be honest

        As my hero Sam Zell said on camera (CNBC) about someone explaining away the Amazon/NYC fiasco, “What a crock of shit”.  That’s called “F-you money” speaking.  When people either have enough to have the F-you attitude, as Zell does, or nothing left, that’s when the truth comes out.  Run the white middle class into the ground, and the “F-you” attitude will do nothing but get stronger.  Those “conservative” ball warmers do their thing to get paid off, financially and socially.  Let them go, they are useless eaters.  Get yourself to a place where “F-you” comes easily and naturally.  Then remember who your real enemies are (it’s a target rich environment).

A conservative with stones would point out that we wouldn’t have these kooks in the Cohngress without open borders, the refugee racket, and the colonial state of PR which should be granted independence in the spirit of liberation.

        Olsen, schmolsen.  There’s really nothing left to talk about.  These people can’t be reasoned with, which we’ve known for a long time.  And for a long time we’ve strongly suspected that they can’t be lived with either.  Since 2017 we’ve been shown the final proof of that.Trump was the last chance (not the beginning of a movement, as some have claimed; the LAST chance) to settle things rationally, and he didn’t do what was necessary to achieve that.  In signing the spending bill, with its immigration attachments, and in the absurd volte-face he’s made re legal immigration at SOTU and at CPAC, he has effectively cut America’s throat.  He has pissed on, reversed, and burned to the ground the only thing he had a mandate to do.  Even if he wins in 2020, which I very much doubt, he’s shown he won’t do the single thing he was charged with doing.  It’s over.The only thing left is partition.  I’ve always been puzzled by the Civil Rights movement because of its inborn contradiction: on the one hand, the Jim Crow regime very much needed to be dismantled, and the obvious oppression of the blacks had to stop.m on the other hand, from a legal perspective, there was no practical way to do this without destroying fundamental rights like freedom of association, and in practical terms as we saw in reality, even the right of self-determination or of self-defense.The only practical long-term solution was not to burn the Constitution or to twist it in knots, but rather to say to the blacks: you’re right.  We can’t deny you your manifest rights… But we also can’t accommodate you realistically, without destroying our own rights.  The only solution is divorce.  You need and deserve your own sovereign ethnostate, and fortunately North America is such a big place, we can carve out a suitable territory for you, then work out details of diplomacy and cooperation later.  In the long run it will be better for your human dignity and development.It’s the same now.  There’s nothing left to talk about.  We must say to the left, OK, let’s accept your definitions of terms.  We’re racist, homophobic, anti semitic Islamophobic xenophobic transphobic monsters.  Yet mysteriously we’re not on a crusade to destroy any of those things, we just want to live as ourselves, free of those things.  We’re White, and mating with negroes realistically ends our future.  We’re Christians, so Islam, atheism and the Jews all swamp, subvert and erode us.  All we want is to be left alone, and since we’re evil goblins, why would you want to come near us?We demand a chunk of North American territory the size of France, Germany and Poland, at roughly the same latitude.  Given the land mass of CONUS and southern Canada combined, that’s easy.  No blacks, no mestizos, no Islam, no Asians, no mystery meat, and above all, no Jews.  Once we’ve finished walling the place off and installing the mile-high electric fence, you’ll never hear from us again, except for air traffic controllers.  You can dance the multicultural horah across the entire rest of the fastnesses of Turtle Island, and poz your kids with trans Globohomo, just leave us out of it.  Don’t call, don’t write.  And above all… Never, ever, ever come to visit.I suggest a state based around the Great Lakes, and controlling the Saint Lawrence River Valley in the east, and the Columbia and Snake River systems in the west, reaching as far south as Humboldt County CA and the Finger Lakes.  That oughta do.Plenty of room, and plenty of great real estate for the poz in the rest of the joint.We could make different map arrangements I suppose, but really, there isn’t anything left to talk about.

            The funny thing is, our side is going to need a mile high wall.  Think of all the people who talk a good game, but don’t actually want to live in a pozzed environment.  Expediency is the modus operandi of the Left, and they want to live lives away from the hell they create for others.  Partition is a calling out on their hypocrisy.  I can think of no better karmic result than their having to offer supplications for acceptance to move over to our side of the fence, and then our denying them entry.  Mmmmm…

            Several years ago I awoke in a hotel in Cozumel, Mexico, went out on the balcony of our room and watched Mexican waiters gathering flowers for the breakfast table, and thought, “This is paradise”.  Let’s raise an army of right-thinking persons and invade Mexico again, send every Mexican to California after the conquest and set up another Constitutional Republic.  We could celebrate conquest as a moral imperative, and racism as statistical common sense.  If I had to choose between living free and freezing my butt off every winter, I dunno.

            Western Europeans have lived in “open societies” for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Clannishness was literally bred out of people. If you look at the demographics of the DC metro, the Right is a small minority that is roundly despised. But our nature hastens towards conformity rather than forming enclaves. The Beltway right cannot sustain itself without constant influx of both donor cash and newcomers. The Beltway left otoh is something of a downgrade from NYC, SF or LA.

        Note that Olsen is actually functioning as theconscience of the left: he’s basically saying, “Oh, you’ve forgotten to apply your principle of punishing anti-Semitism, so I’ve helpfully applied it for you!”He doesn’t get that the left doesn’t have principles, only enemies. Their “principles” are only of the moment–whatever they need to smash down their enemies.It doesn’t get any bootlickinger than this,standing up for the principles of an enemy who hates you and who doesn’t really even hold those principles in the first place.(It should be glaringly obvious that anti-racism is not really a principle of the left. Because they of course are fanatically racist–against white people.Yes, I know, we probably shouldn’t use the bogus term “racism” at all, for the very reasons Zman gives above, but you get my point. And if conservativeshaveto resort to DR3, it shouldonlybe to point out anti-white race-hatred.)

        This is the first time I’ve read Olsen, but I’ll bet, like so many conservatives,  he strongly buys into color-blindness and nondiscrimination.  It’s a guiding principle, and he probably thinks that instead of letting the left define his morality, he’s actually gone beyond the left’s morality.  I’m sure he’ll proudly declare that he’s less racist than Democrats if you ask him.  After all, Democrats believe in affirmative action, quotas, and other policies that are based on…..race!  I’ll bet he’s been a critic of Democrats and their identity politics lately.He thinks we can get past racism if we all look at a person’s character and ignore superficial things like skin color.  And the sooner we silence and purge those who are hung up on those backward ideas like race differences and tribalism, the closer we are to a society of all races living harmoniously.This kind of high-minded principle is really appealing to conservatives.  They like to be above it all, above the simple-minded racist hicks, and even the Democrats who “think they’re combating racism….by being racist!” (DR3!).It’s like they have an internal racism filter or meter, where everything they consider, every thought, every policy, is subject to the question, “is this racist?” Because being a racist, or having racist thoughts is something that has to be erased if we’re going to move forward.That’s why selling race realism is so difficult, when so many subscribe to the left’s morality and conservatives are way up on their lofty perch, feeling smug about their principles.

                    Our culture is now almost wholly based on the negation of observable reality.  I can’t help but think of Wile E. Coyote having run off the cliff edge, suspended in midair, but hasn’t quite looked down yet.  That is where our culture sits right now.

            This.
Progs and Conservatives are just different sects of the Cult of Equality. The Progs believe that all groups are equally capable but that white racism prevents equal outcomes. Conservatives believe that all groups are equally capable but that government regulations and cultural values prevent equal outcomes.
For Olsen, talking about race just distracts you from the real problems. It’s a very safe, very self-satisfying place to be.

                When it comes to redistricting and campaign turnout drives, the GOP suddenly turns into race realists. And then reverts to form when the election is over.
The party elite know the score, they may dispute the causes. A lot are just trying to keep the racket going on long enough to get that New Zealand bunker.

        “The professional right is often referred to as the controlled opposition, because they have the habit of throwing the match whenever they have a chance to win. ”Me thinks Mr. Z is being way to magnanimous re: the professional right; hell, they don’t even show up for the match!They just forfeit the match by not showing up.I have no idea why this is or why they do this, but it sure is frustrating.The left plays by their own rule book which constantly changes as they deem fit; basically they have one rule; Prevail using any and all means.As for the “right,” their rule book also has one rule; bend over.Trump however seems to enjoy openly mocking his opponents, much to the chagrin of those in his own party.Maybe that’s why they hate him.

        “Mr. Olsen are entirely dependent on the Left to define their lives and give meaning to their efforts. They are as much a part of the Left as the house slave is a part of the master’s household.”This correlates directly with Zman’s observation about American black identity. It is defined in entirely dependent terms upon grievances against whitey. Were whitey to vanish in a rapture, American blacks would find themselves rootless. In the same way, were the Left to disappear as moral arbiter, where would conservatives turn for leadership, given their lives have been spent assimilating every Lefty precept from anti-racism to sodomy?“Landru, guide us!”

        Olsen and his ilk are defined by white (including Jewish) Leftists. At their DC parties and media interviews, it’s almost entirely white and everyone knows that the blacks and browns are just props. The Leftists are extremely similar to Olsen and company in terms of race, background and manners.
What happens when Olsen and crew increasingly deal with AOC types who don’t hide their contempt, who don’t keep quiet about the fact that Olsen is their purse puppy, who don’t hide that they are a different race, that this isn’t about ideas?

            Maybe the one a few months ago (can’t remember when or title) where Zman explains the differences between the Dissident Right and normal conservatives and the left.  He starts off talking about the belief that all humans are malleable.  Since biology is where it starts, maybe that’s where your friend should start.  Might as well throw your friend into the deep end rather than only getting in up to his ankles.

            Agree with Wolf. The key tenet to both the Left and Official Right is the blank slate. The Left and the Official Right are simply different sects of the Cult of Equality.
If you can – gently – undermine this belief, all of the rest unravels quickly and without much help from you.

        LOL.  Of course Mr. Olsen is a nice and happy guy – making six figures while doing no real work gives you that option.Try being libertarian minded, and accepting the fact that it means you are responsible for yourself – not the state. Once you understand how badly you’re getting screwed by the state in general – and the lefties in particular……..  it doesn’t really lend one to having a happy go lucky personality.The further you travel along the ignorance is bliss scale towards the side of full blown ignorance – the more blissful you become.  If you can remain blissfully ignorant AND get paid well for it – it’s got to be a pretty good and happy life.Which is going to make the “holy shit I’m actually hanging from a noose right now” realization come as just much bigger of a shock to Mr. Olsen when that day finally arrives.

You say that like it’s some sort of smear. There’s lots of former-left personalities in the dissident right these days, not to say the alt-right as well. I rather dislike the term, but were you just “red-pilled”? Nobody is expecting you to go from “we need to help the refugees and healthcare and free college for everyone!” to “fuck the browns, burn it all down!” after a couple of podcasts. The Candace Owens types aren’t really trusted anyway.

        “That’s part of what makes them great supplicants though. They are so willing to please, so easy going in the face of humiliation and torment, there is just about nothing the Left can do to them to make them angry. The Left selects for submissiveness in its loyal opposition and they are good at it.”” Without the Left, he and the other toadies of Conservative Inc. are nothing. They no longer exist.”I remember this guy he was in that one movie, right? Or was it all of them (Conservative Inc.) just rotating in and out as the same character during the film?https://im0-tub-com.yandex.net/i?id=1a6759317e126fb6c55c074b80dd0cd5&amp;n=13

        The most important point here is that their treacherousness is instinctive, not ‘planned’. I increasingly believe political views are the result of subconscious biological instincts and have little or nothing to do with ‘mature deliberations’. It is the r/K conjecture. They are ‘rabbits’ and hate ‘wolves’. And we hate ‘rabbits.’

        You see this on FoxNews hosts all the time. They can’t keep talking enough how they love immigrants and diversity(except Carlson). They dance around, self deprecate when it comes to trannies and feminists.
When AOC spewed her GND none of the hosts would directly criticize it all all. They’d mumble something about it being unaffordale and move on They avoided the fact it would be a death sentence for tens of millions and the end of the U.S.
