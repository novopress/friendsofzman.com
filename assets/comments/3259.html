        “He was simply the best qualified by a long shot ”You are showing your age. You belong to a time, as I think I do, where the best people got the job on merit. Not chosen on current victim status, or through feelings of guilt or even an egotistical desire to be seen as  ‘modern’ but simply because if you choose the best person there can be no argument from intelligent people.But, I also agree with Peltast. All this isn’t going to end well because the people who are most excitable are never happy with anything. If a person is not happy they tend these days to continue being unhappy and will damn well tell everyone how unhappy they are and what is the government going to do about it?

            “In my father’s time they hanged you for it. When I was a lad they put you in prison for it. Now it’s legal. I hope I die before they make it compulsory.”
