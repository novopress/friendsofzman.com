        “Muh principles” folk drive me nuts.  You and Proggie agree to a duel.  The rules are, you take three steps, then turn and fire.  You both take one step… then Proggie wheels around and shoots you in the back.  Then pisses on your corpse and laughs at you for being such a sucker.  You can’t reason with the unreasonable, nor shame the shameless.  The only thing they learn from is pain.  Make this stuff as painful for them as it is for us, and then we can have principles again.

            The thing is, when the “principled conservatives” are behind you, and the progs are in front of you, there is always a gun pointed at your back.

        My only question is why in the world do people still hold events at public venues?
You mean to tell me not one person has a farm, or private land that can be controlled and monitored?
Honest to God, it’s like stepping on a rake; over and over again.

            Exactly. Spencer is still working from a script that lost it’s effectiveness at least a generation ago.Spencer himself comes from a family with money. He can’t hold his conference  on family property in Whitefish ?They’re still stuck on the supper club model of networking.

                Agreed, he needs to go digital. hold the conference via the internet like smart people do.I’m sure he could buy a old farm property to hold his conference on. But how many people want to be tagged as associated with Spencer?Spencer has just made way too many mistakes, Charlotsville was his Waterloo. He let that Democratic plant organize a event with KKK’ers and Neo-Nazis and every loon and plant he could find.  And it blew up in Spencer’s face.The man makes one bad decision after another. The movement has outgrown this lightweight. We need smarter more media saavy people nowadays. Not mindless bomb throwers like Spencer.Take Trump, he understood the media and beat them like a bongo drum. He played by his rules and got inside their OODA loop and started living in their heads rent free. Trump didn’t care what the MSM thought of him. He bypassed them and made them them irrelevant and the enemy at the same time.

                    Kudos to the younger guys like Spencer et al for giving it a go.But public events, the seminar and conference circuit, is as old and well established as the brothel circuit in Nevada.Trump is a natural.  A force of nature, really.The newbies trying to carve out a target niche need to watch him and bone up on basic marketing.I’m wonder if they merely aim to be the next Conservative Inc.- pitching for the income, while dodging the acid attacks.How many harpies on MSNBC screech, “George Will is a hateful hater!”What’s it gonna take to find some decent talent, a casting couch and a shower?

        When people post old clips of politicians railing against some policy they now support as some sort of gotcha, I wonder if they ever notice that this stuff is completely ineffective against the cult. Now if the cult uses this tactic, it works just fine, especially against muh principles.
Truth as they know it changes from one day to the next as needed. We have always been at war with eastasia.

        Spencer should organize a few thousand homeless persons, load them up with left over food, and then have them shit all over the farm.  Non-violent protest at its best.  Or sue them into BK.  Also stage huge protests and fights every time the farm tries to hold an event.

            Opie and Anthony used to do something similar on their radio show (in terms of logistics, though not politics). They would raise a ton of money for a homeless shopping spree, then load busses up with homeless people and drive them to department stores. The department stores that turned them away shot themselves in the foot, since when the homeless were actually admitted to a store, they were civil, bought some coats and other expensive items, and then left in an orderly fashion. Anthony used to also send “the shit monster” (a guy with a spastic bowel problem) to things like the Occupy protests with his pants filled with a dump. I believe Saul Alinsky used a similar “fart blitzkrieg” tactic.

        At least, it needs to be made widely known that the place has politicized its operation, and that any bookings have big political overtones and associations.  That should do ‘er.  Look what it did for the NFL.

            Doesn’t matter. Anyone connected with the “alt right”, however tenuously, will get the same treatment.

        OT of course but just read about the hijab Barbie available for Christmas. About how long before we start seeing hijab Barbie with a suicide belt on the intertubes?
Spencer doesn’t seem that bright in turning the progs back on themselves, but then, he really does have all the media lined up against him. You really do need to start with the assumption that none of these people are honorable. He doesn’t seem to look a move ahead and anticipate the reaction against him, and be prepared to deal with that.

        I’ve noticed that, when you hit a nerve with a cult member on something they believe that is easily dis-proven, their eyes change, literally getting wider. It’s as if they’re saying, “I am only on broadcast mode, now, not receive, so even though you’re showing me something empirical about say, Muslim violence or immigration’s negative effects, I will not process it.” You talked about this with Bill Maher, his physical reaction to hearing things he doesn’t want to hear. Say something these people don’t like that’s true, and watch them literally squirm and do weird things with their hands and posture.

        What you say is perfectly reasonable.  But it begs the question:  why does Spencer reflexively crave the attention of the Legacy Libmedia?  He tries to outwit them at a game which is rigged in their favor.I say he should try again, but for gawdsakes, anticipate that there is going to be at least 1 of 10, maybe 1 of 5 people in a Blue State could be a nutcase SJW, or at least an SJW-sympathizer.  Have someone else meet the caterer.  Have the food in a separate room.  Keep it simple so it is mostly just dropped off in a buffet format with no waiters.  Hire caterers who are Trump supporters.  No more whining.

        Spencer has more in common with progressives than they care to know .  He should focus on their militant segregationist policies and violation of the civil rights of whites (who they believe are excluded from civil rights laws).
He should be feeding on the carcass of their lack of political situational awareness in order to integrate his views into mainstream media and give the impression he is playing to win.  Otherwise, he’s heavy on optics, low on substance.

He was then shown a video of himself with two college guys engaged in several hours of sex. After that, the candidate just kind of gave up. He went through the motions, but that was about it. He was given a consolation prize to make sure he is there if they need him.
who does this sound like?   i think Jeb!

            If I was a betting man I’d say Ben Carson.  He was appointed to the Cabinet.  I was going to guess Marco Rubio but he wasn’t really given a consolation prize, he already had a Senate seat.

You’re having problems with the truth in your own little way aren’t you.
Try reading the book “The Light and The Glory.” by Peter Marshall and David Manuel. It will help you get over your left leaning bias. And it’s a very good historical read.

                Why do you hate Puritans, Zman?  Aren’t you glad Europeans conquered the continent?  Did they not do what they had to do to win?  They won their own ethno theocracy.  If it’s okay to have an ethnostate, why not a theocracy?  I don’t understand.

                    True, unfortunately.Once their external enemies, others, are conquered, they then turn their energies on internal enemies- their own.
The Pilgrims were fleeing the Puritans.The Puritans followed.  Hunters follow the game.

                        There is that tendency to lump “Puritans” together into a single amorphous mass.  Things were rather more complicated, even at the earliest days of the Bay Colony.  And those that never left the MA were distinctly different from those that pushed into the interior.  I’d agree the “leave behinds” were humorless busybodies.  But the ones that pushed out the frontier were quite a different lot.

                            Agreed.  It took early Christianity 400 years of street battles to congeal.
It took Islam 300 years- the final version of Quran was compiled by Uvalve in 333 After Hijira.  No mention of Mohammed for the first 160 years, and none in the Quran on display in Cairo.  His tomb in Mecca is dusty and unvisited, unlike Calgary.
The Prots took a Hundred Years War to segregate, and never did unify.
Complicated indeed.  Reminds me of India.

                    We tried it hard- Rhodesia; we tried it nice- South Africa.
Neither to any avail.  The natives were too germ resistant.
Perhaps Z is right.  Once hardened and unified- indeed, hardened by that very unification- would we have hunkered down?
Instead, we found new farmlands and ended up feeding the locust hordes.

                Agree.  Calvinist Puritans were the White version of Semitic Islam.
I suspect the Prots cultivated by the same funding, as a further attack on the  sundered Roman State and it’s official religion of Jesus Invictus.

                That’s what’s bugging me about what’s been going on in Saudi the last month or so.  OK, you “soften” Wahhabism and maybe in 75 years you have the Wahhabi version of Unitarian mosques. You get rid of the sword and bloodshed, but you still have the need to purify and control.  Luckily, I will be moldering in the grave long before we have Salafism without Allah.
