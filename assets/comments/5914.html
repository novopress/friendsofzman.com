        Kind of strange how this started with black crime stats and segued into false rape accusations.  Crime stats, broken down by race, are always available at the FBI’s website if you dare to wade through them, which I have. White on black crime is actually fairly uncommon, and white on black sexual crimes pretty rare. Check out the black crime rates for all crimes, keeping in mind that blacks are 13% of the population.The rape thing is a different kettle of fish. There has always been an undercurrent of “untouchableness” about star athletes. They start to believe their hype, especially if they have not much else in their lives going on. They start to believe that anything goes, engaging in behaviors that other circumstances would council them was unwise, not to mention immoral. That said, Feminism’s legacy has greatly muddied the waters between young men and women today, creating situations that would have been either easily resolved or easily avoided a generation ago. How to behave? Many people have no clue.

        You may find these stats interesting.From:http://conservative-headlines.com/2014/12/the-truth-about-interracial-rape/Presently the FBI appears to have only published the full statistical tables up to year 2008. After that the FBI website only has smaller “bulletins” that do not include the full data.From this data we find that blacks commit sexual assault against almost as many whites as blacks. However, white on black sexual assault is an extreme rarity.Year 2003 – Rape/Sexual AssaultWhite on Black:0[Statistical zero is not the same as absolute zero. I am led to believe that statistical zero in these examples means less than 10]Black on White: 20,309Black on Black: 21,104Year 2004 – Rape/Sexual AssaultWhite on Black: 0Black on White: 11,610Black on Black: 35,330Year 2005 – Rape/Sexual AssaultWhite on Black : 0Black on White: 37,460Black on Black: 36, 620Year 2006 – Rape/Sexual AssaultWhite on Black: 0Black on White: 32, 443Black on Black: 7,705Year 2007 – Rape/Sexual AssaultWhite on Black: 0Black on White: 14,092Black on Black: 12,780Year 2008 – Rape/Sexual AssaultWhite on Black: 0Black on White: 19,292Black on Black: 34,841Total over six conservative years:White on Black: 0Black on White: 135,206Black on Black: 148,380Average over six consecutive years:White on Black: 0Black on White: 22,534Black on Black: 24,730

            Interesting. The graphic I used wasfrom here. The interesting thing about crime is except for blacks, the pattern is to rap, rob and murder your own people. Blacks spread the love, but still do most of their damage to each other.

        Thanks for easing that passive aggressive SJW a$$clown’s pain.  Dip$hits whipping out the Ole Nazi Card usually know little to nothing about them other than what their Marxist friends / teachers know to be “true”….  Trying to obfusticate the point of the article is also classic SJW behavior… Brutal &amp; short as U demonstrated is the best way to deal with their “opinions”…

        That graphic is known to be wrong. It originated with a Nazi group in the UK. it was fact checked here:
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/
I don’t care for politifact, but I think they did a good job on this.

            That’s fine, but besides the point. The point being that the greatest threat to black people is other black people, a point no one can dispute. Further, blacks account for an outlandish amount of crime. Young black males are 3% of the population and commit 27% of the homicides, almost all of them against blacks.

                Well, that the graphic is wrong is not beside the point. That it originated from a nazi group is not beside the point. The point you are making — the point in the comment above — could have been made with real statistics. I like your blog because of the level of intelligence, and intelligent people don’t cite made up statics, from a made up organization.

            The U of L basketball prostitute scandal allegation might indeed be true, but I would like to point out that just because someone says it, doesn’t make it true – especially if they are trying to sell a book.

        There is an inversion, I think, in the Whites killed by Whites 16% and Whites killed by Blacks 81%.
