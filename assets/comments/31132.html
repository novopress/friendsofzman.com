        Googling “Icelandic women” will lead you down some rabbit holes.
Beware of Googling Sara Sigmundsdóttir, once you’ve seen this she-beast, you can’t unsee her.

            Violating “gender norms” seems fundamental to Icelandic womanhood. The only famous Icelander*, Björk, went from obscure failed-showbiz-kid punk to normie celebrity by giving unusual-sounding popular musicmaking a makeover as a “cool mom” domestic activity. Previously it was the domain of nerds we’d call incels now. She’s famous for getting pregnant—in a man’s world!
*Nobody remembers Halldór Laxness.

            Now to show you the Matrix you actually live in.(((Googling))) Icelandic women does indeed lead to some mixed results. You will also see that the she-beasts, uggos, feminists, etc. are all VERY front loaded in the search results. Scroll down a few pages and some results that are more what you may be expecting appear.This is because (((Google))) is a propaganda tool and has been for a long time. Also try “White Couple” for additional LULZ. And to show you the most raw form of Jewgle propaganda imaginable.If you’d like to escape the Matrix and see the world as it really is, step 1. Dump Google. Literally stop using it. It hasn’t been a search engine in a decade, its a propaganda device.Go to yandex.com click Images tab. Now type “Icelandic Women”Marvel at what the –real– world actually looks like. Ditto for “White Couple” Everytime you use Google you are giving revenue to your  millennia old racial enemy, never forget this.

                Did you seriously just post that?
You seriously took the 5 minutes of your life to post that?
I don’t even actually use Google. I use Duck Duck Go. “Googling” has become a generic term, sort of like “Crescent wrench” or “Channel Locks” or “Q Tips” or “Chap stick” or “Scotch tape” or “Weedeater”

                J, did you see “No Country for Old Men”?
The waifu from that movie, Kelly MacDonald, made an Icelandic movie, called, “The Girl in the Café”.
She was an absolute GenX Smokeshow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7MlqQfReM
I’d listen to her accent all day long.
She could read names out of the frigging phone book, and I’d be absolutely mesmerized.
Serious weakness in muh knees for that voice &amp; that accent.

            Maybe have your ‘ambiguously asexual’ teenage son stop using Google too before you fuck him up even worse than you already have. Forget who you were for a second, that’s some personal advice for ya, “dad”. 😍

                        The rule of thumb is, if your getting your balks broken, people probably like you.In a previous life, if you weren’t getting verbally assaulted and even worse, you couldn’t return it, you probably didn’t belong.

                        For some reason this cracked me up and made me think of a story from a few years ago. Viking poo in a museum is the largest recorded dump in world history. Do you think he is smiling on from Valhalla at how his poo is in a museum? Do you think he showed it to his friends at the time, and now we too marvel at it?Bonus point for being in the future spot of Lloyds Bank.https://www.the-sun.com/lifestyle/tech-old/2925800/biggest-poo-on-record-is-from-parasite-riddled-viking-who-invaded-england-1200-years-ago/

        About the dullness it is amazing how much less facially and gesture expressive Scandinavians are compared to (white) Americans. A slight nod is a high five lol
Z, if a Swedish or wherever you are, girl just smiles at you and you like her, you ask her digits (waitresses and such excepted). That’s as much signal as you’re gonna get. Often you don’t even get that. Scandinavians are the most understated people in the world.

Does the immediate feel of Iceland more overlap with or depart from the Scandi IKEA* chic besotting American liberals since the 50s (e.g. Bernie, Obama) and drawing impotent grumbles about nuclear umbrella from conservacons? I would expect Vermonters and Icelanders to have much in common for ideology, druthers, manners, but the former are delayed Fatmericans unaware of which traditions or not they are embodying, and the latter retain have very standoffish weird local things like the food. (*Yes I know the line that the IKEA founder was a fan of Hitparader)

        It is time to once again invoke the Tom Clancy agitprop. One of his popular novels,Red Storm Rising, was partially set in Iceland. Here we see our protagonist, young Lieutenant Edwards, in the course of his adventures save a pregnant young Icelandic thot, Vigdis, from the invading orcs, and ultimately take her back to the USA as his bride. Some early conditioning for how the patriotic fighting man was to treat the emerging thot of the future.

        Thanks for the mini travelogue. Flying Icelandair and visiting Rekjavik (and a few other places) is something I’ve done too. It wasn’t my first trip to Europe if you count a two year tour in Germany; it was my first as a civilian. April 1994. Three days layover in Reyk. Nice enough. Only comment I’ll make is that while April is fine on the East Coast, it’s still late winter in Iceland. Drinking (to excess) is a costly affair in Nordic nations and tough when you’re on the backpacker budget plan. Although I was an avid drunk back then, I do not recall getting wrecked in Rekjavik, indeed I don’t recall a single beer there. Oh yeah, another tip: try to avoid travel to Europe when the Dollar is at a multi-year low against their currencies. I repeated the performance in 1995.

        Iceland Air was started as one of the first discount airlines. Their business model was to provide inexpensive flights from the East Coast of the US to destinations in Europe. If I recall correctly, they started it with used, surplus aircraft from WWII which were prop planes. I believe they had to stop in Iceland to refuel, and they allowed customers to lay over in Iceland for a few days at no additional charge.The aloofness of women is just part of Scandinavian culture. And yes, there are beautiful women everywhere. I lived in Sweden for a time and was astounded at how beautiful the women were.Enjoy your trip!

        Something that’s been bugging me with this post is the fat black woman going to Iceland, trying to imagine why she’s going and what she wants to get out of the trip.  Surely not smart enough to reason why she wants to go to an all-white country and not an all-black one but still has enough spark plugs firing to want to…”discover the world”?  I dunno, I’ve seen the same thing with black people in Japan too where, they think they’re visiting a zoo when it’s they who are the exhibit, for lack of a better way to put it.

            This phenomenon is true all over Europe and Japan. They will impose their black femdom all over the hosts as if they are your black advisor and you need this racial input, girlfriend. “Dey doan spice dey food right” is a real thing, no joke. They will exhibit a faux air of superiority and yet bufoonery.
They only worse groups are the Brits, the busloads of Japanese arriving at a place en masse, and the abusive Jews.

            At one time, airfare was cheap enough that young folks would fly to Reyk just for a party weekend. I just priced some flights on Icelandair and it’s as cheap as $550-600 r/t, so it’s possible that Schwarzschildradiusisha was simply on holiday.

            I am not surprised it would be interesting to someone who knew nothing but the marketing, which consists of aurorae, volcanoes, steam bath, etc. (blacks typically aren’t big fans of the mountains but they do respond to class cues and the sauna/resort idea as anyone would). A white Jewish woman acquaintance of  mine went and she said it was boring except for the modern/avant-garde museums… go figure…The cultural fallout of worldtrotting American blacks promises to become funny as with the Sassy Trucker in Dubai. When the Britney Griner thing happened I realized this alt-right script would have been thrown out in 2005 for being too fanciful

        I am 1/4 Icelandic blood and well-traveled there. Some thoughts:– try not to get blown sky high by the sketchy volcano, please– the best hot dog isn’t the famous one, rather, it’s from the joint inside the main Reykjavík town square– near that square there is a tourist sweater shop which enables you to design a custom designed and personally fitted Icelandic sweater that will be hand-knitted by a grandmother/guild member and shipped to your home in about six weeks — get one, they are gorgeous and comfy but not one with the pewter buttons because the buttons will saw through the yarn and fall off– Blue Lagoon is a must, please take a half day and visit there– the people are actually pretty vapid, even my own high achieving family– everybody works two jobs and has written two books– hike the geysers and back country if equipped, it can be seriously beautiful out there– the women are easy to bed but don’t be surprised she makes you satisfy her and then gets up and politely but briskly leaves you without providing her phone number– visit the penis “museum” to say you did and buy a souvenier– keep us posted, be safe

            Can confirm, the back country there is otherworldly. You can do multiple day group backpacking and sleep in shepherds’ cabins scattered about the country. This was the only time I have seen a landscape completely devoid of human presence. Not a single scrap of trash or even a shred of plastic wrapping. Like visiting another planet.

        Once upon a time, our ancestors lived simple lives in small groups in the same general location and familiarity was endemic. Outliers were rare and often times the novelty was a welcome change from the ordinary. And then modernity happened and people started moving all over the planet all the time. The result is that familiarity is nearly extinct and the average Joe is now inundated with an endless freak show of strange encounters and situations. As such, we are adapting to this new ever-changing environment is ways that will have far-reaching consequences for the species.For example, we are becoming more insular and withdrawn in order to prevent sensory and interaction overload. Too much data is being fed to the brain and its over-stressing the CPU. This leads to cognition fatigue and sheeple-like tendencies of follow the herd. We are becoming docile and automatic rather than nimble and innovative. Without a return of real hardship, we are doomed to perpetual decline and colony collapse.Go in search of real existential hardship; embrace it, fight it, conquer it.

        I am a seasoned traveler and went on three stops in Iceland on a cruise.  Reykjavík I found the same as most other major European cities, but with less diversity, grafitti, etc as they are not yet overrun my immigrants.  So more pleasant than, say, Brussels.  The small towns along the coast I thought I could have been in Montana – everyone spoke English and were friendly, towns were small pleasant gateways to the surrounding nature.I did some work previously with an Icelandic company that had an outpost in the US, all staffed with Icelanders.  While they are friendly, they are definitely weird.  I think the deal with the women is the country is super egalitarian, so their men are all smooshy and whipped, and this feedbacks to the women.

I reckon a fake and gay version of what Sea Peoples and Vikings did. Less blood, more bloodsucking. Better restaurants and shops, same old cultural enrichment. Blah blah.
Still fake and gay.

                    You never know. Think I’ll stick around letting others know that wasting time and energy on a dying continent that has values diametrically opposed to the dissidents in America is a fools errand. Immigration and die  advocates in this country come in many forms including stupid white boomers who sold out their future for dumb ass ethnic restaurants and cheap labor to raise their kids and homes.

                        Hart-Cellar was passed in 1965, when the very oldest of the Boomers were not even old enough to vote, much less have any influence on politics. Yes, we boomers have much to answer for, but suicidal immigration policy is not one of those.

                        Ben is right about Hart Cellar at first but bills can be repealed and the Boomers made no effort to do so once they started to get power.
Many of them allowed the younger Silents to keep running the show. Actions less malice and more negligence.

                    Ethnic restaurants are not the real reason.  Such is simply the *only* good thing that can be said for DIE, so it’s a “go to” for the clueless.

                No, the ethnic take-out bit is an after the fact rationalization.  Nobody makes the argument “hey, lets flood the country with foreigners so we can try their disgusting foods” Yes, Mexican food is disgusting.
What they actually use as the excuse to flood the country with foreigners is a generic ‘it will grow the economy’ appeal, which is even more ridiculous than the ethnic foods bit.  How importing the third world will magically grow the economy is never explained.  Even if it were true, nobody ever explains why preserving our culture and people is less important than “growing the economy”

                        @ostel I always catch grief about the Mexican food. But I find it nasty and incompatible with my American tastes. Too much spice. Mushy.  If it is authentic, probably has been spit in by a real life Mexican.
You will eat ze bugz. You will eat ze mexican…

                        Wanted to address Tars’s  point about not having enough children.The mindset that society is entitled to children needs to go. Children are a huge  optional investment in money and opportunity costs an urban society .The presumption that massive level of inflation and wage arbitrage would be met with more children not less is ridiculousIf society wants them they have to pay a heck of a lot for them or replace modernity with highly natal religion . The 3rd option migrants works short term but as we’ve seen, its suicide,The natural outcome of the baby boom and later years was population decline. What went went is the desire for more voters  on the left and the  cheap labor/profits now stockholder  capitalism leading to mass immigration.Had we managed immigration we’d have  been fine and stabilized at maybe 200 million but the US is a bunch of grifters pretending to be obsessed with liberty so  we got what we got.Endgame.

                        It’s a developed taste.  Live where I live for most of your life and you find spicy food envelopes your life.  Not just Hispanic dishes, but condiments and such as well.
When I used to travel back to NYC years ago, one had to look real hard for a Hispanic restaurant.  So rare, I never ventured the long trip to one. (TacoBell doesn’t count)
My suspicion is that now that NYC is only 30% White, such restaurants pervade the city.  But I wouldn’t know, since I’d not step foot in such a city.

        Feminist absurdity seems to have infected Iceland as well as every other white country… Icelandic women went on some kind of idiotic “strike” just a couple of weeks ago.
https://apnews.com/article/iceland-women-strike-equal-pay-970669466116a2b1a5673a8737089d46
(As an interesting aside, George Lincoln Rockwell married a wealthy Icelandic woman when he was stationed there as a pilot in the 1950s).

            From the article, it sounds like it is known /accepted that women are paid less because they take lower level jobs—which inherently pay less.  I suspect, but do not know, that these strikes are intended to ultimately obtain equal pay for *equivalent* work.  This is the theory of “comparable worth”.In other words, the low level jobs taken by women with be judged to be of societal equivalence/importance to the higher paid jobs currently filled by men.  So a maid will be paid the same wages as a trash collector for example.  Of course, a government bureaucracy will be established to decide all these “equivalences”.This was seriously looked at here 35 years or so ago.  I believe it was Clarance Pendleton who denounced the feminist concept of comparable worth in the establishment of male and female pay scales as “probably the looniest idea since Looney Tunes came on the screen.”Interestingly, the USSR practiced this concept wrt their promotion of the “worker” as opposed to the bourgeoisie “intellectual”. In short, a bulldozer operator was paid as much as a physician or college professor.

        Europe is a decaying authoritarian dump. Filled with the remnants of failed wars and a broken population dying out at tfr’s below 2. An authoritarian shithole filled with American bases. Any relevance of a European civilization rests in freedom loving conquerors across the Atlantic who gave up on the tyrannical, genocidal and lunatic bullshit left on that dying dump. If only the authoritarian scumbag, monarchy worshipping remnants in Canada got the message and left. Their terrible queen and now king wouldn’t mind.

After the based poles and Lithuanians used jews as their tax enforcers against “their” people for centuries, don’t think eurozone freaks have any right to complain since they still worship the same tax collectors and central bankers in brussels. Gotta love those Rothschilds.
Also gotta love last election giving themselves to be run by the brussrls authority. Their tfr is something to behold and soon will be loving more migrants from Africa very shortly.

White Redheads with cute twangy lilt, the horror! I far prefer swarthy mystery meat fat assed ‘Merican women with their affected ghetto accents.

        Good morning. Are you sure about Ireland? The reason I ask is that one of my best friends  just got back from visiting his mother in Dublin. He has gone over there for years to help her celebrate her birthday, but he said that on this trip the locals turned into complete a-holes.He said he has been noticing this for the last few years, but this time around they were no longer hiding it. He told me that back in the late 90’s/early 00’s that the locals rolled out the red carpet for you and that he never once felt threatened in any way. He said that every place he went to on this trip he and his family got nasty looks from everyone.

            I last went to Ireland in 2012.  No doubt the cities have changed, but the rest of the country wouldn’t have had time to.  It’s the kind of trip where you can rent a car and see a whole country in three or four days.  Dublin and Cork weren’t the highlights.

        So Z, looking for a house in Iceland? 😏
I got the sense that Swedish women think men are all slightly ridiculous, so the dull facade is concealing laughter…
I suspect that’s ALL women, just some women hide it better than others. Granted, many men think women’s concerns are silly, so we do it too.
Just as an aside, once you move will your posts appear at 4:00 AM ET?

        Have no idea why their is still an unrelenting obsession of vacationing and traveling to Europe. An authoritarian shithole that killed itself from 1914 and 1945 and sold itself to dictators in brussels. An awful compliant population that doesn’t even reproduce itself and kowtows to dc like loyal nothing vassals. Couldn’t pay me enough to be spend time and resources on that collection of serfs and dictators. If we only we had the strength to send the rest of the authoriatarian scumbags back across the pond and  out of the candaian hinterlands.
