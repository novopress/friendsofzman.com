        Poor old England. I couldn’t imagine being the policeman who knocked on this kid’s parents door to tell them their child was under arrest for a Tweet. They probably needed an explanation as to what a “Tweet” is.

        The social media are even more destructive to the mind than is television. As one great Frenchman wrote, the more that people are free to be as they are the more they will strive to be alike. Add Facebook and Twitter and the collective mind is a self policing force which even makes it’s victims smug in their wretchedness.

        Probably ‘Bat Shit Crazy’ would be understood on this side of the pond, though there are dozens of phrases that might be used — some of which however may arouse the ire of the Social Media Approval Authorities.I was intrigued by the fact that the arrested youth lived in Wiltshire, which for those not familiar with UK geography is (in terms of the British Isles) quite a distance from both Manchester or where Arsenal play in north London. It is long said by football (soccer) fans in England that almost all Man Utd — or ManUre as they are called by many — fans do not live in Manchester. I once had business dealing with a man who would undertake a 400 mile round trip to watch Man Utd home games. Every home game, and while he was not a Mancunian he would make the journey from his home in London. The joke is that Manchester people can’t get in to the ground for all the non-Mancunians packed in.Anyway, if the lad arrested had been a ManUre fan he would have cheered Welbeck prior to his transfer to Arsenal and would not have cared a fig for the player’s skin tone. If so, he couldn’t really be racist, and for all I know could have tweeted prodigiously how great Welbeck was when he was scoring goals for ManUre.If the lad had never attended a football match then he could be tweeting about all sorts of people with possibly a darker skin than his own. (By the way, if he tweeted something about the colour of someone with lighter skin than himself — and I always note how pale the lovely Nicole Kidman is — would he have been in trouble? No, wait, I think I know the answer already).Arresting the youth for not obeying the rules also sparks the question who grassed him up? I actually doubt if a bobby happened on his tweet, so the lad in Wiltshire may have friends who, er, aren’t very friendly.

            That’s the thing about authoritarianism. It turns everyone into a weasel. In North Korea, children will turn in parents, even knowing it means certain death for the parents.
