        As GOBSMACKER correctly notes, higher level plans will likely cover these unusual conditions and related medications.  The article also points out that Charis Hill is receiving her medication through a patient assistance program sponsored by the evil drug manufacturer.  So much for being screwed over by the man.Charis Hill is most likely a product of the California public education system, right up through college.  She thinks she is smart because she can read a HuffPo article all the way through, and can give the correct answer for numerous Trivial Pursuit questions.  Yet she can’t seem to figure out that a cheap catastrophic health plan will not cover her rare debilitating illness.  She also does not understand that it is her responsibility to manage her own illness.  As this link to Drugs.com showshttp://www.drugs.com/price-guide/enbrel, there are numerous options to help low income individuals afford drugs like Enbrel.  But that requires effort, and less time available to demand that the local city council build more bike paths.Charis Hill, who probably works in a bookstore, because waitressing or cocktailing is too hard on her back, bought the cheapest insurance policy she could find/afford, and didn’t bother to read it.  She just assumed the cheap policy would cover her rare spinal condition.  I’m sure it was a saintly pharmacist, after 20 minutes of shrieking hysteria, who found the program that got Charis Hill the help she needed.

        You have to go way to the bottom of the linked article to discover that many of the alleged difficulties are addressed if only people would select the higher cost silver and gold level insurance plans instead of the cheap, bare bones plans they chose so they could avoid paying for their own health care.

        Charis Hill is a charter member of the parasite class that now rules the country.  From birth to death she will take more from society than she contributes.  She is a net drain on the national wealth.  All societies have their parasites, but they are usually marginalized and controlled.  They are now the reigning political force in America.  Barack Obama was the first U.S. President elected by the parasite class.  He won’t be the last.Previous Presidents, from FDR to LBJ, contributed to the growth of the parasite class, but were not necessarily beholden to it.  The old Democrat coalition was not primarily parasitical.  The working class voters that formed its core worked real jobs, and contributed to the system.  Even Bill Clinton, a transitional figure, who presided over the destruction of that working class core, understood that the nation needed a productive economy to loot.  Barack Obama only understands the looting.Almost everyone is a looter now.  Giant corporations are primarily rent seekers.  The monstrous media/entertainment complex contributes nothing.  Companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google are unprofitable Ponzi schemes.  The education racket bleeds the state and Federal coffers dry, and produce “biking advocates” like Charis Hill.The rot has already set in; there is no reversing it.  When you’ve got Tea Party “heroes” on the Republican side, like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, coming down on the side of rioters and looters, and begging illegal immigrants to love them, you know its over.  When you are reduced to begging for the looters’ scraps, you should just pack it in.

        “Coverage of expensive drugs tops their concerns.”Apparently the issues that make (actual) medical care/drugs, as well as the “redistribution” that SOME folks call “insurance”, so expensive in the first place, is not.Hey, I know, let’s make it mandatory.And document EVERY “loosely” related aspect.THAT’LL “fix” it!

        The stupid hippie chick’s name is Charis Hill.  With a name like that you know why she is a stupid hippie chick.  I laughed out loud when I read, that she believes that riding her bike helps alleviate her chronic and debilitating condition.  Sure enough, further down, Charis Hill is described as a “biking advocate.”  No wonder she can’t afford her medication.

        What the lunatics dont understand is that health care can only be rationed on either supply or demand.  In canada the land of ‘free’ socialised health care it is rationed on the supply side – hence waiting lists, lack of specialists etc.  Until ACA health care in the US was rationed on the demand side – sliding scale of prices for a variety of services and insurance.   The lunatics simply do not get it.  It’s not free and never was.
