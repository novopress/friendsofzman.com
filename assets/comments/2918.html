        I haven’t forgotten Rove (and Bush) talking their stupid polling interpretations in Bush the Younger’s second mid-term election.
They denied until the day after the election that the republicans would lose control. And I’m glad they did. That congress was worse than the democrats. Course now…

        Someone is making money selling something in a free market economy? Say it isn’t so! While I grok your point about “spokesmodel”, why is it a racket to earn a living espousing conservative viewpoints? We’re all adults here, and most of us are able to discern between the “party line” and an original thought. If I could earn money from my conservative views I would.Good for Malkin and Coulter. I do, however, take issue with Porky Pig, er,  Karl Rove. He deliberately misleads people to further the aims of the Establishment Repubs, whose views really are not much different from the Progressive Dems. Hannity, a lightweight, but seems nice enough, likes to refer to Rove as the Architect. I respond to the tv, The Architect of Doom. I can’t get over the stupidness of the people who actually pay this man to advise them.

        amen a thousand times over. The fleece the rubes party is up to their usual hijinks.They can always trot out Rove, Morris, et al on Hannity’s show (if he still has one) with the latest swill and the beat will go on and nothing will change.
