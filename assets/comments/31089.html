        Even when they have total control of the state, radicals will believe themselves to be the underdog, fighting a much more powerful enemy.This is true. I was with a bunch of center-leftists over the weekend and whenever I said that Trump would be thrown in jail before being allowed to run for president, they almost always said, ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù If pressed, they think Trump and MAGA is a great threat‚Ä¶or at the very least, they think the Republican party is held hostage by Trump loyalists, and that Trump himself is some kind of regime figurehead, as opposed to the pariah he actually is.Speaking to them ‚Äì and these aren‚Äôt wild pink-haired leftists mind you ‚Äì I got the impression that they think there is a struggle for good and evilwithinthe American political system, rather than the entire system (‚Äúthe regime‚Äù, a term which I used and they had no idea what I was talking about) being of one hive mind and Trump is merely the rather clueless champion of the dirt people.

        May be a bit of over analysis, sir. Rolllins is running against Southern California incumbent congressman, Ken Calvert. Ken Calvert isn‚Äôt Maga at all.  Since the candidate has outed himself, I would rather look at this from the standpoint of the typical aggression that you find in queers who are politicized. The most dangerous animal on the Earth is probably a scorned and angry queer. They will stop at nothing.

            Sorry, but I beg to differ.  The most dangerous and destructive force on earth is still the kneegrow.  Then comes nuclear weapons, then comes politicized queers.

        Yo Z-Man. I saw some video yesterday from Israel. It was the second time I have seen a heavily produced and organized music concert. This one they created some elaborate light show with one light for every hostage and had some pop star right and sing a brand new song as the hostage family members walked across stage.It is an interesting and new aspect of warfare. It is also a bad look in my opinion. The person who showed it to me thought I would be impressed. On the contrary, my first thought was, ‚ÄòIf you are suffering a second holocaust and an existential threat, why are you free to have giant open air concerts and pay a massive surplus population to attend and put on such spectacles?‚Äô It doesn‚Äôt add up. I have a request that you do an article on this topic and tie it to other past similarities if there are any and discuss how you think it may work or backfire.It is really a massive cognitive dissonance. It is as if the power is so absolute that they are just performing for themselves on an international stage not quite aware of how this may come across to out groups. Curious to hear your perspective on this one.It made me recall a line from Wilmot Robertson in ‚ÄúThe Dispossessed Majority‚Äù, expressing concern that we are ruled by a group of people with zero track record of success of running a civilization at any significant scale. Are these war-time American Idol productions own goals? Anyone?

I saw the original Star Wars in the theater but it was before puberty had hit.  Today, I have heard that Carrie Fisher was asked not to wear a bra in the movie, and I was young enough not to notice!  Now re-read my first sentence.

                I‚Äôve seen our guys mock Israel for putting out a bunch of soy-brained propaganda ads aimed at America and Europe, using the ‚Äúiconography‚Äù of Star Wars, Marvel, etc., to cast Israel as the superheroic savior the West hasn‚Äôt proven itself good enough to deserve.Like America‚Äôs, Israel‚Äôs is a regime that believes its own ‚Äúsocial media metrics‚Äù‚Äîwhich are almost entirely the product of censorship, bots, and propaganda ops. It‚Äôs like they made Reddit into a country. Just a few years ago Israel‚Äôs PR personification was something like a religious scholar who has you in a headlock (gaudy gold bracelet cutting into your ear). Now it‚Äôs a tranny janny deleting your posts while cataloging his Avatar-themed AI-generated CP collection.

            In Ukraine 2014 the crowd‚Äôs decision (made in America) to move from outside to inside was the signal that behind the scenes the ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù had been accomplished. Plausibly, some US legislators/etc. who weren‚Äôt in on the J6 joke considered the sight of some goofball from the Water Buffalo Lodge walking by to be the same sign.Sending that false signal is at least partly why ‚ÄúWe need to go into the capitol.‚Äù On 4chan and Kiwifarms, oldfags watching the J6 streams live noticed that a couple of the same goony Ukrainians (next seen on TV as Azov heroes) were present for both events.Some congressmen posed for photos with the grannies who stopped by. Some posed COWERING IN TERROR! when no one was near them. Others angrily demanded the slaughter of the crowd.The ‚Äúouter‚Äù ruling class is more a target of psyops than a generator of them. J6 was several going on at the same time. The regime has never even bothered to have a coherent story about it.

        ‚ÄúHowever, the initial rise in hospitalizations wasn‚Äôt as severe as expected. The Mercy‚Äôs crew treated about 80 people before departing in mid-May.‚ÄùAnyone else here get a phone call or two from an excitable lib you knew, after Trump tested positive for the Dread Plague (October 1st was when he went into Walter Reed)? It is quite a thing to recall in my case, as my correspondent seemed to actually believe the evil one would be immobilized by the end of the month or hopefully joined the choir invisible (to mix cartoon religion metaphors). If it were just normal tacky Schadenfreude I would‚Äôve been less unsettling. It is also hard to unpack this reality divorce for J6 (formerly ‚ÄúJan-6,‚Äù which was summer-of-2023 parlance)‚Äî did they think this was what a revolution looked like?

            I don‚Äôt get phone calls from liberals but I did have a luncheon with a medium sized group of relatives and in-laws that week.  A couple of them were almost trembling with pleasure at the fact that Trump had contracted Covid.  They talked about how he deserved it for not taking the virus seriously (as if!) and were like kids on Christmas Eve, awaiting even better news ‚Äì from their point of view ‚Äì about his health.
In retrospect, what difference would it have made if he‚Äôd actually died at that moment in time?

                I had pretty much the same at a family dinner at a nephews house. During dinner, the conversation was about the vaxx, and I said my family did not do the vaxx and we never caught the covid plague.That did not sit well with nephew, and he let me know it.I walked up to his Alexa device and asked it: Alexa, what company paid the largest criminal fine in history?After Alex spewed the truth, you could hear a pin drop.Nephew‚Äôs opinion of me did not improve.

        I‚Äôm still surprised that no one has tried to assassinate Donald Trump. He presents a luscious fat peach of a target. He‚Äôs been the most dangerous enemy to the Left in 50 years, and why go to the ballot box when you can go to your gun box and get your bullets?Assassination has been the preferred solution for extremists since the Archduke was assassinated triggering World War I. The cascade effects of assassination are tremendous. First, you eliminate the person himself. Then, you put a dent in his ideology by marking him off as mortal. And finally, you assert your own side‚Äôs virility through the gun.When Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, it changed the course of American history even though the war had been won. Lincoln was the champion of mercy toward the South. There would have been no carpetbaggers had Lincoln lived. Moreover, the South‚Äôs fatal embrace of the Democratic Party, which lasted a century until Lyndon Johnson drove Dixie into Republican arms with his Great Society nonsense, might have been averted if Lincoln had lived. A moderate, responsible Abe governing from a centrist platform in Washington would have been a powerful peace branch to the U.S.Donald Trump seems to have no fear of following in the footsteps of Lincoln. And why should he? The man seems to believe in destiny if not karma. A man who isDESTINEDwho can whisper to the gods and get them to drop plums in his lap, like banished court cases that have been bothering you for months.It seems that the only thing the Donald has to fear is that the gods stop smiling upon him.(Click on my name to continue reading my pro blog.)

            In current year it‚Äôs virtually impossible to assassinate a president. Or an ex one, evidently. This ain‚Äôt Reagan/Hinckley. The security apparatus is gargantuan by comparison. Even as a suicide mission it‚Äôs questionable.
Best attempt I can recall since Hinckley is the guy who threw the dud grenade on stage with Dubya somewhere in eastern Europe in the early aughts. And that‚Äôs no sure fire method even if it had detonated.

            For our rulers, the perfect plan would be to get the FBI to agitate and assist someone who is to the right of a normie conservative to do it, perhaps because the assassin felt betrayed by Trump.  So much the better if he could be framed as a white supremacist.  Imagine the righteous denunciations from the normie conservatives against the MAGA extremists.  Unite your allies and divide your enemies indeed.

            I suspect it is the same as the reason there has been no false flags (or additional false flags, if J6 was one): there is fear such an event might start a rush of non-state-sponsored assassinations and terror. Even though they are criminals, pathological liars and sociopaths (maybe BECAUSE they are those things), and, yes, also incompetent, there likely is a deep-seated and justified concern that a well-crafted state-sponsored kill or explosion might act as a spark that would endanger the people they truly do protect.Not everyone is a geriatric Boomercon who thinks their vote matters. During the Cold War the CIA assassinated several people who made things even worse‚ÄìDiem and so forth. This crew is nowhere near as intelligent and savvy, obviously, but they aren‚Äôt functionally retarded, either. They are admittedly quite insane so this may be an overrationalization but it strikes me as the likely reason.

            Every leader with common sense prepares plan for his incapacitation. Trump is also not in jail . So there could be serious obstacles for assassination or imprisonment.
Maybe we need to think that Donald is actually much wiser than most of us think and carefully prepared for battle for many decades.
And he may have invisible but powerful allies keeping him safe.

            What would assassinating Trump accomplish?  He presents no real threat to the system, and provides a relief valve for disgruntled citizens.  If Trump wasn‚Äôt around, they would have to create one.
On the other hand, you assassinate him and he becomes JFK.  A martyr to the cause and who knows what it unleashes.  No, assassinating him would be the height of stupidity.  What they need/want to do is humiliate him, but that is a tough challenge.

        I have something extremely important to share that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúon topic‚Äù, but it does touch on the ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù language that leftists have indoctrinated our children with.Several months back, my 14 year old son, when asked about his interest in girls, made the statement that he thinks he is ‚Äúasexual‚Äù. To be clear, my kid is perfectly normal, but he‚Äôs always been a little behind in his developmental progress compared to other boys his age. Even still, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all that weird for a 14 year old boy to not have quite yet developed an interest in girls. Perhaps not having that distraction will ultimately serve a good purpose for him.Fast forward to a few days ago. We were in the car and he seemed deep in thought. I prodded it out of him and he decided to reverse that earlier statement. He said, ‚Äúdad I‚Äôm not really asexual, I‚Äôm straight‚Äù.Well (setting aside my obvious sense of relief) that terminology struck me as a little bizarre anyway, and I asked him why he would think that ‚Äúasexual‚Äù has to be something other than ‚Äústraight‚Äù.He said, ‚Äúwell I googled asexual and the article I read said that asexual was part of the LQBTQ community‚Äù. So in part, his motivation to not call himself asexual anymore was due to a repulsion to the idea of being lumped together with trannies and pedophiles. I don‚Äôt blame him at all for outright rejecting that label.Which brings me to why I‚Äôm posting this. My son is a perfect example of how these people control the narrative by controlling the language. My son is somewhat impervious to the pressure to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù because he‚Äôs a bit of a loner. But for every boy like my son who isn‚Äôt comfortable with someone else inventing a category for him, there are dozens who absolutely want to be part of a category in order to have an identity.Our world survived thousands of years without the term ‚ÄúLGBTQ‚Äù even existing. Indeed, it was well into my adult life before that acronym was even uttered by anyone. I suspect the people who think of themselves as ‚Äúasexual‚Äù (a perfectly legitimate thing to be) only found themselves lumped into this catch-all a few years ago. If there was ever a ‚Äúsocial construct‚Äù, it is the idea of atypical sexual proclivities having anything in common with each other. They absolutely do not, other than being ‚Äúsomething other than perfectly straight‚Äù, which doesn‚Äôt actually make it ANYTHING. We don‚Äôt define ourselves by what we aren‚Äôt. That‚Äôs no kind of definition.I explained to my son that you can be both straight and asexual. I think this would have been the assumption for many people for most of history. Not every man walks around with a raging erection whenever a woman enters the room. Some men only see value in the opposite sex as child bearers and caregivers, but don‚Äôt have the motivation for the physical part of making those babies. In other words, their brains are perfectly straight, but the hormone levels don‚Äôt push them to act upon their instincts.When talking about this with him, I compared it to someone who doesn‚Äôt eat a lot because gluttony or a unsatisfied sense of hunger. Some people simply eat to survive. They still eat, and they don‚Äôt have a need to create a separate category for themselves other than ‚Äúeater‚Äù. The difference being that they don‚Äôt dwell on food all day long.Well the good news is that he did also express an interest in a girl in one of his classes. So his asexual tendencies are just a quirk or a stage. I‚Äôm not worried about him. But I do find a sneee of rage in knowing that there are perfectly normal kids just like my son who would read leftist propaganda and fall in line with their destructive ideologies simply because they need to fit in.

            Why you are not contacting other parents and standing with pitchforks and torches at the gates of every school board meeting demanding to know ‚Äìwhat‚Äì poison is being poured into your kid‚Äôs ear on a daily basis is a mystery to me.This passive acceptance mode is what got us here and every story like this I read is another blackpill for me.You need to be a barbarian at the gate.

Yeah, have that talk but then go for the jugular afterwards on the people that are teaching this garbage.You flatly state you are ‚Äìaware‚Äì he is being indoctrinated and do nothing?

I had a conversation with my son and we came to an understanding of how things really are. This has nothing to do with school boards.

                Apex, I understand your sentiment, and school policies ARE important, but the school administrations are the smallest piece of this.For instance, I moved to a small town last year that is basically the Land that Time Forgot.  When my boy got into a fight at school he was not given detention, suspended, or sent to a social worker. The vice principal, with my permission, paddled him instead! 6mo later he got in another fight and the VP said (I swear to God), ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not going to paddle him hard this time. That other boy has been needing to get his butt kicked for a while.‚ÄùAs you can imagine, rainbow paraphernalia is completely absent in this school district.But, my boy still knows more about that garbage than he ever wanted because of the popular culture. We talk about it often because it is confusing for him to be bombarded with things he instinctively finds repulsive. For instance, we had to talk about how ‚Äústraight male‚Äù does not equal ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù, and that masculinity is not inherently ‚Äútoxic‚Äù.The good news is that teenagers have always rejected most school moralizing (just not to the extent of Gen Xers like me). This era of perversion IS damaging, but you must actually be exposed to these kids to see that there is a lot of eye-rolling.My point is that the popular culture is the biggest culprit damaging our kids; I must compete with YouTube for my boy‚Äôs soul, not the school.

            As my years advance, I realize and admit the truth. I have never seen women as anything other than sex objects. It has always been thus, I just used to lie about it. Even to myself I think, because I had been conditioned by society to be expected to relate to them in some other way.  But why would or should I see them some other way?I was just as conditioned as your son, only subject to a different era‚Äôs conditioning, to believe that I was supposed to relate to women intellectually or emotionally (ha ha, no, really, I‚Äôm serious). When the fact was, my natural inclination towards women was perfectly suitable for the purpose.

            Thanks for a very thoughtful post.  There is also a chance that when he falls in love with a female, a stronger sex drive will kick in, which is how it should be.  But a strong biological urge to procreate can lead us down an immoral path.  He may lead a more healthy, balanced life than most.

                That‚Äôs not what my post said at all. In fact, it says that he told me he was interested in a girl in the class.What it said was, a few months ago he was struggling with understanding his lack of interest (then vs now) and that he now has found an interest in a girl in his class.It also says that he‚Äôs always been a little behind in his maturity level.No, not every boy is walking around with hormones oozing out of their ears.You see, people, this is why we have leftist bullshit ideas. People like you all who respond with ‚Äúeverything that doesn‚Äôt fit exactly in neat, perfect categories is an aberration‚Äù only serve to push absolutely normal people who don‚Äôt fit your binary logic perfectly  into a feeling of being ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, and they seek a sense of belonging elsewhere because they feel rejected by that binary thinking.This doesn‚Äôt mean they have to fit into some kind of gender-fluid mush of rainbow choices either.Why not just be a ‚Äúkid who hasn‚Äôt quite figured it all out yet‚Äù and leave it at that?For fucks sake.

                    Sumguy, I also have a 14yo son, and I‚Äôm with you. As I tell my boy, the teenage years are where you figure out what kind of man you want to be.At 14yo, I only cared about D&amp;D, my Ruger 10/22, and building bike ramps. By 16yo, my penis was making 90% of my bad decisions.On the other hand, my son has always been handsome and showered in female attention. But, he chooses not to date right now because, in his words, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a small school and I don‚Äôt want all the cute girls to be ex-girlfriends when I‚Äôm in 10th grade.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a weird and confusing time, and that is why the pervert lobby seeks to recruit them.

            Let‚Äôs lay off of the judgement of Sumguy. He is handling it in the way he best sees fit. We are a small pirate ship which, for now, confers no status, wealth or other benefits for people to join us. We need to lay off the judgement and either just listen or respond with some humility.As for fighting the schoolboard ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ I think that is probably a waste of time. Unless you can wholesale replace the schoolboard and then replace the curriculum and do it in say a years time frame you are still only 2/3rds of the way home. You can‚Äôt fire the teachers or force them to teach properly. Our path forward is organizing home schooling with extended community and summer/winter activities where our Remnant and our posterity can build bonds while we give an extremely well rounded education to our future.School system reform, if even possible, is such a long time horizon endeavor, some rare local jurisdiction exceptions, it is makes homeschooling and Remnant household networking the only truly viable path forward.I have posterity who have come home crying because the school system at 8 and 9 made them sexually confused Sumguy. It is pure evil. Glad you have good conversations with your son and hope you guys get to bond over masculine activities that aren‚Äôt exclusively organized sports. Hunting; fishing; target shooting; back country outdoorsmanship with real risk/reward seem like great ways to bond and build up trust with a young man.God bless and stay strong.

                Respectfully, I disagree with your assessment about school board reform. The obsessive focus by the political left on the transgender/sexuality issues in schools, and especially in elementary schools and middle schools, has created a huge opportunity for our side to take over school boards and even local governments. As it turns out, not even most suburban moms want their 6-12 year old kids exposed to soft-core, gay porn in the school library or drag queen shows in the public library. Who knew?This is already happening all over the country, even in blue territory. Of course, the media portray it as extremist right-wing MAGA nutcases taking over the school boards and imposing their right wing morality onto an unwilling public, but nobody believes the media anymore. Everyone knows the truth.Better advice to Sumguy: run for the school board. Recruit several of your like-minded friends and take over the board. Fire the senior administrators and replace them with like-minded administrators who won‚Äôt tolerate this crap in the schools. Fire the librarians who stocked these books. Fire the problem teachers. Make your school district a shining example of how schools can work when not infected by the political left.One of the right-leaning blogs (Redstate?) went down the path of local activism for a while. They may still be doing it, but I‚Äôm not really in that political sphere anymore. I‚Äôve moved on to the dissident sphere.

            I sympathize, Sumguy.  If you have a kid a bit *different*, the society we live in is like quick sand.  It will suck him down into the abyss.  I was a loner too as a child, but the society I was surrounded by offered no solace in being ‚Äúodd‚Äù or ‚Äústrange‚Äù.  You were normal or you were in essence ‚Äúbullied‚Äù.  Yep, bullied into some sort of societal normality.  There was no movement then to niche (label) you into some category (of oddness) and then support you in such behavior.  Mothers teach unrequited love.  Society teaches something else entirely.I hold no grudges.  Actually, when I see the freaks that now pervade our society, I‚Äôm glad.  Feminization has taken hold, and we are not the better for it.I know there are probably those here who will argue against my statement.  I concede in advance you have a point.  Growing up was not pleasant and my parents were less than helpful (by modern standards) in that endeavor.  However, navigating the social jungle of youth and masculinity encouraged me to perfect other skills‚Äîsome bad, some good.  I truly doubt I‚Äôd be where I am today had I been born a generation or two later.What I did not like as a youth, I tried not to inflict upon my children.  That was the entirety of my parenting skills.  So mom is the center of their attention now when they want affirmation and a sounding board. I can accept that.  I‚Äôll settle for being the one they are afraid to disappoint.  So far, they have not.

        I believe what is to come will be quite different from the Bolshevik and Jacobin experiments. The self described ‚Äúelites‚Äù who are actually very poorly/ill educated people whose only genuine attributes are arrogance , narcissism and self importance, will not in the end, prevail.In this country, we have a real history of self governance. Neither Russia nor France really ever did.Many of the readers here clearly are well informed, educated and intelligent, but have very little daily contact with real workers who as a matter of survival, have lots of common sense.  The welders, shop keepers, painters, plumbers, truck drivers, etc will save this country, whether by their sheer numbers, courage or great good sense. . The real problem is that the Left believes in Fiat Rule.  You can‚Äôt drive a truck just ordering it to go. The sink drain doesn‚Äôt unclog itself on command by some bureaucrats.We could save this country from this utter foolishness if the people who make this country run, stop doing the bidding of those who pretend to run the country.Who  saved the cornered soldiers at Dunkirk? The mighty British Navy? No- it was thousands of the ‚Äúlittle people ‚Äú who courageously jumped in their little boats and saved the day.We are at a Dunkirk moment. We just need to realize our own worth and, dare I say, power.

            The government, at all levels, still wields enormous power through its purse strings and cadre of normies in various law enforcement organizations. The latter are largely slaves to salary/pension blackmail and will do as ordered. So fighting the ‚ÄúMan‚Äù is foolhardy in the present. But everything changes post-collapse. As every cop who has ever served on a riot line knows, the unknown can get you dead in a hurry and bravado is no protection. Chaos changes the battlespace fundamentally, which is why we must wait for the fog. The GAE‚Äôs most formidable enemy is not the resistance, it is the collapse.

            We all understand the problems with mobilizing. But the fact is, the trucker protest was successful. The regime backed down. However, Tamara Lich, Chris Barber and others are still looking at hard time. Trial delayed yet again. Was it worth it for them? Stay tuned. But I think we all know how it turns out. Examples must be made.

                The regime got to test its power to use out-of-uniform military and cops from distant cities to physically attack the people. Test passed, both practically‚Äîthere are no good cops and no truly resistant citizens‚Äîand legalistically.They were somewhat unsure, hence the excess of propaganda: staged nazi flag march, adding ‚Äútransphobia‚Äù to the list of truckers‚Äô sins just because it‚Äôs on the regime‚Äôs libel-of-the-day calendar, etc. If they‚Äôre capable of learning, our rulers learned that no propaganda is necessary‚Äîthat psyops and show trials aren‚Äôt persuasion but gratuitous sadism, which is so much more satisfying.The American military‚Äôs internal propaganda about the truckers was even more insane than the Canadian media‚Äôs. Bases near the border were warned of planned convoy attacks by ‚Äúanti-worker‚Äù protestors. That‚Äôs a quote‚Äîrhetorical battlespace prep for an operation in *total unreality*.

            Organization &gt;&gt;&gt; weapons. If we could help blue-collar workers organize, we could play at the big table. The Canadian truckers were a highly encouraging example of this
For entirely tactical and optical reasons I think it should be strictly nonviolent. The hard part will be organizing. I could easily imagine a lot of bluecollar are more based. Literally unruined by college

        We already see the weaponization of the law and Stalinist show trials. We are dangerously close to the weaponization of psychology.  How long will it be before enemies of the regime are round up and sent to psychiatric hospitals and subject to shock treatment to cure our unclean thoughts? They‚Äôve already turned types of mental illness into normal character traits. Is the opposite of that really that unthinkable?

            Not sure of Federal law, but there was one *murder* committed on Jan 6, that of protester, Ashli Babbitt.  Here in my State we have felony murder laws which state that *all* participants in a crime are guilty of murder if any person is killed during the commission of the crime‚Äîeven if they (the ones killed) themselves were committing said crime.I‚Äôm surprised that such charges were not leveled at those accused of entering the Capital on Jan 6.  But in any event, we can see the level of tyrannical abuse the elite can yet avail themselves of as they ratchet up persecution of the opposition.  Not sure we are not right up there with Lenin‚Äôs Bolsheviks.

        Aging attorney here. The Rollins advertisement was disturbing in the extreme. By any meaningful legal standards the treatment of the January 6 defendants has been a travesty of justice and a national disgrace. Any attorney who claims to be proud of his involvement as a prosecutor in that process is wholly lacking in any commitment to the principles of justice as they have been defined for centuries in the West. He is a tyrant in the making and belongs nowhere near the levers of government power.I spent a few minutes researching this aspiring tyrant and found this little nugget in an article in Politico:‚ÄúIn the interview, Rollins said he plans to talk up his support for congressional term limits, which he favors as six terms for the House and three in the U.S. Senate. He favors a cap on Supreme Court justice terms and likes the idea of federal circuit judges that rotate on and off of the high court. Rollins said he doesn‚Äôt favor age limits for elected officials, though.‚ÄùThe Supreme Court is established in the Constitution, which specifies that the judges thereof are appointed for life, as are all federal judges. Neither Congress nor the President can limit the tenure of Supreme Court justices. They can rotate judges onto the Court, but once appointed they cannot require judges to rotate off the Court. This is first semester constitutional law stuff, if not eighth grade civics class stuff. That an experienced attorney, prosecutor, and aspiring member of Congress would utter something so astoundingly stupid as this statement boggles the mind.

            Term limits are fine‚Äîbut seemingly impossible to implement.  I‚Äôd rather we approach such from the angle of *age limits* or mandatory retirement.  Folks understand such even though conflated with term limits.  After Biden, Pelosi, and a score of others, capping the age for Federal office at 70 or 75 might pass.  Not the ideal, but if you look at Congress and mark who‚Äôd have to leave at 70, you‚Äôd get rid of your most obnoxious a-holes‚Äîboth Dem and Rep.

            The constitution is a piece of paper sitting safely tucked away in a museum that nobody cares about.  AFAIK, constitutional law is not really studying the constitution so much as it is studying legal decisions that absolutely ignore what the constitution says.If anyone cared what the constitution said, we wouldn‚Äôt have entire categories of people who have been stripped of their rights for life.   Police would not officially rob people and armored cars on the side of the road. ‚ÄúCivil Rights‚Äù law would not exist. In fact, most of the federal government would not exist.We pay lip service to the idea of having a constitution.  It‚Äôs an after-the-fact justification of doing whatever it is they want to do.  Just go look at Wickard v. Filburn!!  There is absolutely no human activity theoretically possible for a person or group of persons could do which the federal government does not already regulate or claim regulatory authority over should the desire arise. They actually claim the constitution grants them authority to do this!  If we could magically bring the people who created the constitution and US government into the present to take a look around and then send them back, they would just give up and pledge allegiance to King George.

        &gt; People climbing barricades brought to mind people more radical than themselves.
This characterization of the J6 protesters is a bit strained. Most of them were flag-waving CivNats: hardly a bunch of radicals. They engaged in minimal violence, especially compared to someone like Fanny Kaplan. Many of them were overweight boomers who could‚Äôve used help getting up the Capitol steps.
The regime may have magnified the power and importance of these aging boomers within the regime‚Äôs reality distortion field but even so, they must realize that J6 was a hollow gesture with, at most, propaganda value for MAGAs.

                    Exactly. Just listen to the quivering voices of every congressman interviewed the evening of J6. That was genuine terror. Fat Boomers or not, if 10% didn‚Äôt leave their guns at home, it would have been a massacre for all. They know that they were only saved by the mob‚Äôs own restraint. That is why DC remained an armed camp for weeks after the inauguration.
It was a significant emotional event for the Cloud People.

            The Regime‚Äôs reaction to J6 rather than the event itself put it in opposition to the populace. As JR mentioned below, the plan apparently was to replace the current people with the poor, needy brown folks. To the surprise of exactly no one that is proving a dismal and catastrophic failure.
It would be no small irony if the justifiably loathed Boomers ultimately and inadvertently save their white children and grandchildren. Given the inadvertent benefits of the Trump presidency, don‚Äôt discount it.

            The power of the magnifying the importance of the J6ers is it magnifies the power of those who imprison them. In reality, Beowulf was probably a local warlord of the Geats. But, to the audience who heard of his tales in Anglo-Saxon England, his struggle was against the very element of destruction and death: a dragon; his defeat, valiant but inevitable, is the same defeat that all will face in life. Which leaves a more awe inspiring impression in the mind of the audience? Symbols powerfully affect our minds.Let me put it this way: how likely is it a group will assemble again, on the conservative side, as a display of dissatisfaction?

                Great question, and I‚Äôve thought I had the answer more than once, but this is the answer I keep coming back to:The Red Team has never been known for large-scale protest. The annual ‚ÄúRight to Life March‚Äù is about the closest thing to a conservative protest movement, and that was just a bunch of boomers that everyone ignored.J6 was an exception, and accomplished nothing for the Red Team, except very REAL prison sentences. No one is advocating for more of the same.I think the only large-scale, real-world, nonviolent, protest that they might get support for is a national labor strike like the French occasionally do.This is 100% a product of my imagination since I haven‚Äôt seen anyone proposing such action, but I think it‚Äôs a possibility. It‚Äôs disruptive, but temporary and safe, so normies might embrace it.

            J6 was a false flag intending to encourage real riots.  Compare it to the summer of love, it was bullying with the subtle message being ‚Äúwhat are you going to do about it?‚Äù.  What most here long for is not coming back, your best bet is to let the thing fall apart and save your energy for what comes next.  The best thing you can do, is not fit the narrative they are trying to sell.

                You‚Äôre exactly right. AINO will collapse in time. It is already doing so, although perhaps not as rapidly as we would like. At any rate, the wisest approach is to be patient and then strike when the beast is spent.
Having said that, there is a part of me that would dearly love to see a spate of colossal violence and destruction visited upon AINO‚Äôs Power Structure even though I know it would likely be counterproductive.

        These people have been locked in place since 1933.  If you look over a list of names from the FDR Administration, some will be familiar, but more as the well heeled (multi-generational contacts bringing multi-generational ill-gotten wealth).  Nearly all of the insider club can trace their political lineage to the mid-century builders of this machine.  These aren‚Äôt revolutionaries, but counter-revolutionaries.  Having detached themselves from the economy of the country decades ago, they‚Äôve also detached themselves morally (these are highly moral people, you just wouldn‚Äôt want to have their morals) has led to an ultimate self classification as a Second Estate.  In reality this is an inverted Second Estate, that worships ‚Äúthe science‚Äù as the First Estate.  The J6 people were an uprising of the Third Estate that had to be taught a lesson they‚Äôll never forget.Just as the Second Estate during the time of Louis XVI was composed of insular, obtuse people, so is this one.  The more the country fails, and it is failing, the more they‚Äôll blame the Third Estate, which in todays time, they call MAGA.  They imagine them with garish margarita machines on their kitchen counters, maybe even a trampoline in the back yard.  And it only gets worse from there.  This is why they‚Äôre manically attempting to replace them with a brown version of the Third Estate, a people more docile and worthy of them.  A people who don‚Äôt ask questions.This is the 22nd Term of the House of FDR.

        That ad from Will Rollins is instructive. He lays out various programs to control the flow of information on social media and TV. And take a wild guess who will be the arbiters of what are facts and what aren‚Äôt?He also attempts to link J6 with the Russians, Chinese and, even, Iranians. You can tell the ruling class truly believes that there are ‚Äútraitors‚Äù within the US who are working with foreign countries, especially the mean countries.Here‚Äôs some nice quotes from his campaign website:‚ÄúWe should also reform and update regulations in order to break down information bubbles and propaganda so that actual facts ‚Äì instead of brainwashing ‚Äì reach the public. ‚Äù‚ÄúAfter January 6, Russia, Iran, and China reportedly tried to capitalize on American divisions by exploiting U.S. social media platforms and spreading hate.‚ÄùThese guys are scared, and they‚Äôre going to push back. Look at the hysteria about antisemitism going on. These people understand that there grip on power isn‚Äôt based on being loved nor do they have the numbers. They have control of the information flow. If that goes away, they‚Äôll need to resort to more direct means of keeping power.Again, you see this with the usual suspects directly attacking universities, politicians and anyone else who varies from the party line. They couldn‚Äôt control the narrative, so they attack institutions and, particularly, individuals. You can bet many university presidents have been told that their careers are over if they don‚Äôt play ball. Same with politicians.In some ways, we may look back fondly on the days when the ruling class controlled the narrative and didn‚Äôt feel the need to use more aggressive tactics to feel safe.

            Academia has always been the epicenter of the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement against Israel, so it should come as no surprise that the universities have dragged their feet in offering the requisite condemnations of Hamas and the Palis. What‚Äôs more, academia has for many decades tolerated the most radical and offensive speech, as long as the radical offenders are attacking rightwing targets. And in academia, support for the Palis is farther to the left than supporting Jews for the simple reason that the former are PoC and Jews are seen substantially as being white.Hence academia has hesitantly supported Hamas, and the only reason for the hesitancy is fear of losing Jewish money. Were the monetary sword not hanging over academia‚Äôs head, its support for Hamas would be fullthroated and comprehensive, just as it was for the Moslems in the aftermath of 9/11.

            The attempts to link dissidents with Russia,China and Iran: How many of us could truly say that as it stands now, looking at Russia, would we root for them if they invaded?

        This guy (link below) thinks surveillance is becoming so tight that rebellion is becoming impossible.  Assassination is related to guerilla warfare as a tactic. It seems both are becoming strict suicide missions.TomA yesterday reasonably asked why people don‚Äôt act on their beliefs. I think one reason might be that one‚Äôs chances of not dying or becoming the regime‚Äôs torture pet in a concrete box, seem demoralizingly low. Most of us still have too much to lose is the honest truthOnce life becomes unbearable anyway, or someone who fears they or their kid, have been slow-killed by the vaxx anyway, that calculus may change for them.

            The vaxx showed what it will take for people to push back. People felt their and their family‚Äôs lives being threatened so many just refused. Even the threat of losing their job didn‚Äôt make them do it.

                Most didn‚Äôt refuse. I also think the fear that people may have been poisoned is so great that most will respond with denial. My impression is that friends and relatives reacting by lashing out angrily if you mention concerns about the vaxx being dangerous, is quite common. Ive experienced it a couple of times. People attack the messenger, not the perpetrator. But that‚Äôs probably the denial phase.
There are so many factors in play, other than that it will get sporty, i have no idea where we‚Äôre going

                As horrified and dismayed as I was by the compliance, the resistance was substantial and shocking, too. The states and localities going their own way was the most positive element. This cannot hold.

                ‚Äú‚Ä¶ surveillance is becoming so tight that rebellion is becoming impossible.‚Äù
Not a far out thought.  To this point, I ask those doubtful to examine all the modern ‚Äúintelligence failures‚Äù they can think of.  Were they the result of lack of information, or general incompetence to act upon the information gathered?   I‚Äôd say the latter.  Human error is against us, not technology to surveil.  To the effect of curing human incompetence, I give you *AI*.  It‚Äôs not going to get better.

                    Agree. I often think that hacking skills with a laptop is a far more powerful weapon of rebellion than a dozen firearms or even explosives. Without wanting to attract too much fed attention, you‚Äôd want to create a chain reaction that they have to deal with. But of course they‚Äôre aware of that so hacking the power supply or banks is not easy. And still, regardless of VPN s, encryption and various things, assume they‚Äôll find you. It‚Äôs not encouraging

                    Tight surveillance is a two-edged sword though. The more efficient and active it is, the more data is produced and has to be combed through. And the more incompetent the stasi grows, the more apportunities to work around the spying.

            I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs entirely true.  Sure 19th century methods won‚Äôt work, but they never worked all that great to begin with if we‚Äôre being honest.  Technology is a powerful force multiplier for even a faceless one-man crew and the yawning gaps in the surveillance state can be seen for anyone half-way paying attention.  Additionally Floyd-Covid made this worse, for the regime, since a lot of anti-social behavior now gets ignored.

                Probably and hopefully you‚Äôre right. I have a hard time gauging just how tight surveillance really is. But today I do think it‚Äôs a one way mission (it probably always was, unless you were on the inside)

        Can‚Äôt help but notice Mr. Rollins invoking flat earthers. The flat earth ‚Äúmovement‚Äù may or may not have been created by Mockingbird, but Mockingbird has doubtless worked to keep it ‚Äúalive‚Äù and prominent, as it is doing right here. It‚Äôs convenient to be able to paint anyone who disagrees with you as a ‚Äúflat earther.‚Äù It‚Äôs also despicable. ‚ÄúAnyone who isn‚Äôt on board with my program is a deranged kook who believes in the nuttiest nonsense.‚Äù Yet in the very same ad he says people should be able to hear ‚Äúboth sides.‚Äù (See? There are only two!) I won‚Äôt say in a public forum what I really think about scum like him.Didn‚Äôt Lenin have syphilis? Probably a horndog. So when he heard a female voice call his name, his instinct for a new conquest kicked in. That‚Äôs why he stopped. Oldest trick in the book.If we could merely remove sexual deviancy from public office we would cure at least half of what ails us instantly. There used to be some effort made to do this. Wonder why that was? They must have just been mean back then. It‚Äôs noteworthy that as soon as the intelligence community started letting homos in the ranks openly, they staged a coup against the very next republican president.

            I‚Äôve always assumed the deviancy push was simply another Leftist tool to reduce the West to rubble and thus create fertile ground for building their Utopia from the ashes.First time I enlisted in their military I had to  affirm that I did not use drugs, was not a homosexual, and had never been a communist.I assumed they wanted to (rightly) make sure I wasn‚Äôt a degenerate that would be anathema to the system or be susceptible to blackmail.It seems now those same kill switches to working for the government are not only deactivated, the behaviors are now encouraged or lauded.Maybe this change is a way of solidifying and armoring up the cadre of the exact people they want running the technological and bureaucratic arms of thir government.Let‚Äôs face it, with a few exceptions, technology-savvy people tend to be either creative or autistic adjacent and not exemplars of masculine traits or traditional virtues. Their group tends to have much higher proportions with mental and psychological afflictions. The CIA ad with the non-gender-conforming, bi-polar, deviant-blah-blah Latina weirdo was a feature not a bug for them.TPTB really do see their control resting with technology rather than the historic norm of men with sticks and guns. Surveillance, information control, and drone warfare is their weapons tripod.Exalting deviant behavior has two effects with regards to the people they see as their foot soldiers in this futuristic model of command and control.Blackmail is no longer an issue. Opposition forces can‚Äôt blackmail you for your closet skeleton when your boss at work praises the fact that you have a ball-gagged furry skeleton on full stunning and brave display!Secondly, the freaks and geeks can be psychologically conditioned to imagine there are legions of horribly white, racist, whatever-phobes just waiting to burn them at the stake. It propels their loyalty with fear and hatred for those they are meant to control and subdue.Dunno. Might be barking up a weird tree here. But I do know I was conditioned in the military to loathe and fear communists long before I had legitimately established a philosophical and historical framework for despising them.

                That CIA Latina identifier was a low in their high-low pincer of the middle and traditional. The BiPOC order is a patronage network. They get a class of compliant do-nothings who hold sinecures and act as a spy class. The new JCOS has already done this with his, ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù, initiatives. There is now a core of, ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù, advocates who wear a special purple armband thingy thing and must be interspersed amongst the troops. The Bolsheviks did this ‚Äì institute an ideological enforcement arm that were interspersed throughout the apparatus of governance to inform, spy and suppress internal dissent.I think part of the depths of absurdity of Richard Levine and the trans thing is to be so absurd that it both makes it hard for ideological dissenters to hide their reaction thus identifying them immediately. It is also fully degrading and demoralizing to those for whom compliance for comfort and stability is most important. Most people cannot go back once they humiliate themselves to that degree.

        Just so, which is why ‚Äúsmarter rather than harder‚Äù should become an imperative for anyone in the DR. The idiots running DC cannot keep the plates spinning much longer; the sovereign debt is too large to rollover and printing fiat just hastens the day of reckoning. And as the collapse approaches, the temptation to go full tyranny will become immense.For that to happen, they need false-flag events to justify martial law and mass detainment of dissidents. And for this they will rely on normies in law enforcement and the national guard to follow orders. And it will become a precarious race between imminent collapse versus totalitarian dominance. But the models predict that panic will overtake countermeasures (particularly in the cities) and social chaos will become unavoidable.This will be the fog that tilts the balance against the pathogens. The jackboots will be fully engaged with rioting mobs and opportunity will abound. Don‚Äôt be in a big city. Think outside the box.

            ‚ÄúThe idiots running DC cannot keep the plates spinning much longer; the sovereign debt is too large to rollover and printing fiat just hastens the day of reckoning.‚ÄùTheir Central Bank Digital (so-called) ‚ÄúCurrency‚Äù is precisely to obviate any kind of fiscal or financial collapse. The plan is not to let things go that far, and I don‚Äôt think we are going to see any kind of ‚Äúcollapse.‚Äù Not, at least, of the kind that most people expect. The transition into techno-hell will be relatively seamless. Most people (think COVID) will gladly accept the new ‚Äúcurrency,‚Äù and won‚Äôt grasp its true significance until it is too late. THEN things will begin to happen. But not before that.‚ÄúFor that to happen, they need false-flag events to justify martial law and mass detainment of dissidents. And for this they will rely on normies in law enforcement and the national guard to follow orders.‚ÄùI don‚Äôt know. I think I disagree with you there. We know that on J6, Nancy Pee was on the phone to the Pentagon demanding Army regulars because she did not believe that the National Guard troops at DC‚Äôs disposal would obey their orders. Thepentagon turned her down flat.No, I think that they realized at that time that they can NOT depend on the National Guard OR on all of the army regulars (many, yes; all, no), so they are now importing hundreds of thousands of young men to be their enforcers and to disarm heritage Americans. That‚Äôs why we see the astounding ‚ÄúCamp of the Saints‚Äù images all over the ‚Äònet nowadays. That‚Äôs why, as Michael Yon and Matt Bracken have been reporting, these young men are paid $2000 a month and are taken deep into the interior of ‚Äúour‚Äù country and settled there. Or maybe ‚Äústationed‚Äù there is a better way to put it. They are not here for ‚Äúa better life.‚Äù They are here to disarm heritage Americans and to be the regime‚Äôs enforcers, and to blow up power substations and bridges and roads, which is why fanning the flames of a mid-eastern war seems like less than a good idea, but I‚Äôm odd that way.‚ÄúThey‚Äù have never before had the manpower to establish martial law or to disarm the civilian population, but now they do. And ‚Äúthey‚Äù know that these new enforcers can be counted on absolutely.

                They are destroying the country for some reason with the open borders, and this very well could be it, but there has been zero competence illustrated to pull it off in the sense of permanent power and wealth. Covid came to an abrupt end with the Canadian truckers‚Äô strike and some governors basically taunting the feds‚Äìand the resultant fear caused the martial law to come to a rapid close. They panic easily, which makes such an iffy proposition as a mercenary war all the more unlikely to work out.The emergence of Colony Ridges does bolster your point, and I do think these are intended as garrisons of sorts, but they also are sitting ducks. Much of what is happening is ad hoc wish casting.They now do have foot soldiers, but that alone doesn‚Äôt guarantee victory or even a beneficial truce. The CDBC might work, and there seems to be a rush to cancel anything that enables any independence‚Äìsee the proposed ‚Äúkill switch‚Äù on all vehicles for a good example. But, again, the competence to exploit the control is questionable.All of which is to say that even if this is happening and I‚Äôm right about incompetence, the upheaval would be tremendous and likely not benefit them‚Äìnot that it‚Äôs been thought through that clearly.

                Connect the dots as you have presented them. The GAE imports mercenaries and stations them in sensitive locations within the interior. These mercenaries are then tasked with conducting sabotage operations, thereby triggering a demand for action by the government to quash this psuedo-insurrection. Martial law is declared and National Guard are activated to put down this terrorist threat. As with 9-11, new laws are passed eliminating Constitutional protections and imposing a de facto tyranny in the USA.
Is this the sort of scenario that has just played out in Israel?

            Martial law is coming ‚Ä¶ it will be interesting to see where and how the people respond. The cause for it ‚Äì that‚Äôs what remains to be known. I don‚Äôt think the ones ‚Äúin charge‚Äù have decided what precipitate martial law. But it‚Äôs coming.

        Well if we learn anything from history, it‚Äôs that Nature abhors a vacuum. This System cannot stand this level of chaos and friction.Women decide elections here, to the extent that elections matter at all. The average soccer mom isn‚Äôt prepared to deal with third-world chaos and inflation in suburbia. I‚Äôm not even sure the single Bossgirls can take it anymore. Voting for it in the abstract is way different from living with it on a daily basis. Another year of this crap and Trump will look like George Washington to all the Karens.So the Oligarchs must now choose between operating the System with no feedback at all or giving the masses a new face and a new narrative. I‚Äôm betting on the latter, as it just seems easier.

            Once I would have put money on a military coup.
Then I look at today‚Äôs military.
One set of oligarchs right now is finding out people are disgusted with them, and they imported lots of these enemies into their host countries. Ooops. I‚Äôm pretty certain there isn‚Äôt a faction, oligarchs and otherwise, in control now.

                Probably part of why they wanted to neuter the military. A pattern I‚Äôve also noticed in Europe is, the military is being stripped, the police is being built up.
For some reason police forces are often more loyal to regimes than militaries are. In Turkey in 2016 the army tried to coup, the police stopped it (rumors Russia tipped ergodan of, nice thick plot). I think this is a general pattern, militaries are more independent of regimes than police are. And therefore more dangerous to the rulers.

        George Carlin used to joke that, after every mass murder, the local news people would interview the guy‚Äôs neighbors and someone would inevitably say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the quiet ones you have to watch out for.‚Äù The joke, of course, being that if some guy is standing there quietly while another guy is wielding an axe and covered in blood and jumping up and down, you‚Äôre not going to be watching out for the quiet guy.Unless, that is, you‚Äôre a crazed fanatic.Look at the footage of the ‚Äúalt right shaman‚Äù that‚Äôs not regime-approved and you‚Äôll see some goofy normie wandering around, about as dangerous as a Pats fan in body-paint. And yet people like him‚Äînot even Sam Francis‚Äôs MARS (Middle American Radicals) but just a regular middle Americans‚Äîare what our regime fears more than anything else. Normal white people who will tolerate almost anything. Maybe it‚Äôs because the people in charge know they intend to put us through not ‚Äúalmost anything‚Äù but the absolutely worst they can imagine. It‚Äôs the guilty fleeing where none pursue, crying out in agony as they strike you, etc. There‚Äôs an interview online with Merrick Garland crying about the persecution his ancestors faced in Western Russia, as if a normie named Smith protesting in D.C. is responsible for some Slav west of the Urals. The only thing they probably have in common is blonde hair and a belief in Christ, but I suppose that‚Äôs as good a reason as any to throw a man into a lightless cell.Reading about revolutions and all the Machiavellian intrigues is just so exhausting. A lot of people get off on the Game of Thrones backstabbing and forming alliances and making enemies, but I would rather just live my life. Unfortunately, the people in charge see even that as a threat to them. If their existence revolves around seeing you as a threat and you‚Äôre clearly not, they regard that as an even greater threat, since it threatens their whole construct of reality. It‚Äôs like some woman jogging who‚Äôs so afraid of being raped that she maces a guy who tries to tell her that her shoe is untied.

            (((Fanny Kaplan))) ‚Ä¶ is almost like she was being prepared to come to America some day, the custom of changing names to culturally passing as chameleons is old. Another observation is that the atheist socialist religion is really demonic, is like these people want to reach their Valhalla through terrorism and political assassinations. We already had a zombie apocalypse and it is still ongoing on college campuses in the US and the US gov.
The memory of these people should be immortalized as assholes and demons.

            In Re Not Enough Gun.About 15 years back due to a long and weird chain of causality I found myself at midnight in an outdoor seafood restaurant in downtown Kota Kinabalu. Across the road was a typical SE Asian love hotel with blacked out street-facing windows and the median strip was being patrolled by aggressive illegal immigrant Filipino trannies. One remembers such things. Warm tropical night with all the local atmosphere you could want, and then extra.But the seafood ‚Äî doubtless caught by the Sea Gypsies living in houses on stilts above the sea one saw on the drive in from the airport ‚Äî was excellent. Which was just as well because the Hong Kong equivalents of Made Men who had invited me out to dinner to pull cowries out of cowrie shells and gulp them down all Baby Yoda like were great connoisseurs of all that creeps and crawls in the Deep.Is there a point to this rambling reminiscence? Well yes there is. Conversation got around to some Malaysian Chinese wise guy they knew who had recently survived a shooting and was up and ambulatory again. Much disgust was expressed at the amateurism of the shooter who had shot him multiple times through his car door using a .38 Special. Every man and his not-to-be-eaten-dog KNEW that this just wasn‚Äôt going to cut it for a through the car door job. Lots of  learned nodding around the table. I tried not to nod too vigorously.

        I‚Äôm not so sure. Bolsheviks vs. SRs etc. was about ideology. What the idiots in the Imperial Capital have done is make it about culture, which is the same (in this case) as making it about biology.With their fumble-fingered response to the Gaza thing, they effectively published the League Table of the Progressive Stack. We all kinda sorta knew who was at the top, but so long as nobody actuallysaid so,every group of Spiteful Mutants was able to think themselves on top, and thus keep their focus on their own special enemy. But now, not only does every group know that the highest they can possibly rank is #2, but they‚Äôre starting to wonder just why that is. After all, there are umpteen million of us, and only a very few of them‚Ä¶. and they are very old, for the most part, and concentrated in a few highly visible geographic locations.And, like clockwork, we see Muzzie politicians threatening to turn Michigan red. We get the sudden, totally unexpected release of the troon shooter manifesto. We get polls from Europe revealing that hey, whaddaya know, the peopledon‚Äôtwant millions of Muslims in their territory, and we even get Nordic countries declaring the expulsion of illegal immigrants (which in their case means ‚ÄúMiddle Easterners and North Africans‚Äù).I‚Äôm not sure another round of ‚ÄúHate Whitey‚Äù is going to be able to paper all that over. They‚Äôre going to need to get their coalition back onside, stat, and I have no idea how the hell they‚Äôre going to do it. After the Gaza thing, even the ol‚Äô reliable false flag is going to be hailed as a great victory bysomebody.

            My guess is they haven‚Äôt resorted to a false flag because it will produce a lot of the real things by folks just waiting for the first flare to go up.In days of old a Cromwell would emerge, but that requires a dominant race, ideology, religion. There is no Cromwell possible when Shitavious wants to get busy with a rent troon and Mohammed is totally opposed to all that and everyone has forgotten what The Current Thing is today.This is the first Post-Modern Revolution, and given the enemy is nature/reality, that assures it will remain permanent since the only Cromwells on hand are fake and gay and despised by the masses.Awful as this is, it also may prove a great opportunity for us.

                The ancient Greeks had a name for the hero who arises from relative obscurity to lead in a crisis. They called him ‚ÄúThe Gray Champion‚Äù.
American examples are George Washington, U.S. Grant, Robert E. Lee*, Stonewall Jackson, and Dwight Eisenhower; they were all basically nobodies before their respective wars started and assumed their roles with humility.
IF a Gray Champion is in America, by definition we haven‚Äôt heard of him yet.

            We get polls from Europe revealing that hey, whaddaya know, the people don‚Äôt want millions of Muslims.We‚Äôve known that for decades and near-single-issue natpop parties have been polling in the 20% range for the last 20 years ‚Äì usually putting them second or third in parliamentary systems with 8-10 parties.we even get Nordic countries declaring the expulsion of illegal immigrants.That is nothing new either, it‚Äôs just being repackaged and sold as hardlinerism.European countries have never recognized that illegals have civil rights, and here in Denmark they are put in camps if they for one reason or another cannot be sent home; open camps that is, but camps none the less: three hots and a cot and, alas, pocket money, but no work permit and no gibs.Technically, they do the same in Sweden although (like Britain) they don‚Äôt enforce it. Nobody, not even in Sweden or Britain, talk about amnesty. Lots of talk about needing more legal immigration, yes, but not amnesty.But if it‚Äôs becoming a topic, it probably means we‚Äôll have amnesty on the agenda soon.

                        What strikes me about the demonstrations is how peaceful they are.I believe this is quite significant. Moslems are usually not afraid of using violence, but something is holding them back, keeping them in line. I suspect they‚Äôre getting their shit together.For the last few years, a Danish-presenting Jew named Rasmus Paludan has been touring with a Koran-burning roadshow, going around the ghettos with a hefty police escort, burning Korans and shouting stuff like ‚ÄúMohammed loved to have sex with pigs and dogs.‚ÄùPeople have been fined for much less over a FB post, but for some reason this guy is not fined for hate speech, indeed he has a police bodyguard that, up until now, has cost the tax payer in the $4-5 million range. And he‚Äôs on mainstream television all the time.But if you watch his videos, the only persons you see apart from the horde of policemen and journalists, there are less people than at a Biden rally, a few handful of gangbangers shouting at the police and sometimes throwing a bottle.And it‚Äôs not fear of the police or the lack of will to wipe the fat clown off Allah‚Äôs green earth that‚Äôs holding them back.All this to say that I suspect the Moslems are getting more disciplined, more organized.

That is fascinating. Maybe the Muzzies think this is a trap and are indeed getting their shit together.

                        Yes. They certainly seem to have spotted Paludan for an agent provocateur from the get-go and have decided not to raise to the bait.But it‚Äôs also that they don‚Äôt actually care very much what infidels do, because you can‚Äôt blaspheme if you‚Äôre not a Moslem.What people often forget about the Jyllands-Posten Mo-toon Affair (the OG Mo-toon brouhaha) is that initially nothing happened, nobody was terribly offended. It was only a few months later, when Moslem governments suddenly decided to make it an issue, that thing blew up.The same happened with Paludan, by the way. Right before Christmas, some Moslem countries started making noises about boycotts and such and boom! whaddya know: The flesh puppets in parliament decided it was time to re-introduce blasphemy laws, pointing to the confected ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù about Koran-burnings.Thank you, Rasmus Paludan!

                        Riots in France have only been surpassed in terms of intesity and geographical scope by the BLM riots in the US in 2020.
France also has a nationwide counter-insurgency operation  called Operation Sentinelle.The French government admitted that up to 70% of its army is employed on this op.  France is already in a low intensity civil war.
Euronormies might want to look at France or Belgium before worrying about the US and Britain.

True, and the Mo-toon riots were almost as bad. France had one of the usual riots just last year, when the cops shot a fleeing car thief or something.
And that‚Äôs what makes these Hamas-demonstrations different. The Moslems are perfectly ready to riot, but for some reason they‚Äôre not doing it this time.

                I‚Äôve always liked the idea of implementing camps.  Here, you would ideally go to a camp to await your turn in the courts for admission due to whatever BS reason you have.  If you get tired of the camp, you can ask for ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù deportation.My bet is that in a year, the illegal migration would dry up (we are getting some days in this sector/town over 1k) and we‚Äôd have caught up on the camp buildout.  In WWII for example, we transported‚Äîand housed‚Äîhundreds of  thousands of Germans in camps around the country.  Nice facilities too.  We literally built them separate two-person rooms in barracks.  As far as entertainment goes, they had it all and the good ones were allowed to work the surrounding farms and were *paid* US wages!.  Some left after WWII with more money than they‚Äôd have earned in the German army‚Äîassuming they‚Äôd lived through the war.  One famous one, even escaped during repatriation to remain in the US.  Was living a good life for 18 years until caught.

        The age of walking up and shooting a guy is great political theatre, but comes at the cost of brutal repression and loss of the moral high ground.Wondering if the future or political repression is not going to be assassinations or cancelling, but inflicting psychological harm in the form of exposing them to hallucinogens, poisoning their food with weird compounds, breaking in and messing with their furniture like the East Germans used to do, etc. Basically make their enemies go insane. I‚Äôm sure there are all sorts of concoctions the CIA has come up with to make a guy go off his rocker they can subtly inject.

        ‚ÄúOur revolutionaries are just as aware of the past as the prior revolutionaries, but they are just as trapped by the dynamics of revolution, so they will be compelled to follow the same path. What lies ahead is not a break from the madness, but a renewed assault by the radicals.‚ÄùThe Bolsheviks and Jacobins were insane but highly intelligent. These people, to put it mildly, are not that bright.Our radicals also are far softer people who are used to abundance. They never have missed a meal unless they were dieting, never have slept in the cold unless it was on a backtracking trip to Patagonia. The proletariat is not suffering greatly, either, so border jumpers with cell phones and debit cards have to do.There is much reason to be apprehensive, and part of it is that our radicals, not their opponents, in fact are Kerensky. The Palestinian supporters marching in lockstep often have deviated from the quiche and mineral water revolutionary narrative and it is not without irony they got geared up in October.This looks more and more like the eating time of the revolution, complete with the chaos and nihilism, led by crazy people with neither ideology nor a utopian goal. There will be many more January 6 uprisings but they will come from within the house. The first Great Terror at least had targets outside of the house.There is no Lenin.

                A Lenin isn‚Äôt even possible when The Current Thing changes daily and the coalition is ready to kill one another 24/7. Lenin himself got off on the PoMo chaos but near his end had to embrace an abbreviated version of Grillerism hawked as The New Economic Plan.
There may be a Cromwell out there, but he‚Äôll face the same chaos.

            Jack, you see nihilism in our leaders but I don‚Äôt.  I see nihilism in the poor guys killing themselves with fent, but our elites seem to really believe that the world will be a much better place when traditional whites are vanquished and subdued.  Can our elites be a nihilists when they hold strong beliefs and a vision for the future?

                They started out with a plan to replace whites and that remains a goal, but, yes, it has degenerated into nihilism. I disagree with Z quite a bit on the concept of emergent behavior as being the only or a primary factor, but it does happen and that applies here. The benefits of chaos are diminishing rapidly, whites remain the dominant racial group, yet their foot remains on the gas pedal. A good example is the inability to maintain support for any length of time for lucrative wars. Yes, they happen but that has become far more different.They also have bought into The Current Thing, which changes daily, after cynically using it to attain power. Note that the love being shown to Palis is increasing and starting to include Clouds among the fans.

                    tl;dr: There is no Lenin, and cannot be one due to distrust, so a well-constructed goal and plan has fallen into utter disarray. Some time ago I predicted this year may see the first Cloud on Cloud hit and that seems likely now.

        The problem they‚Äôve got is the same as the one they have in Ukraine.It‚Äôs all fakery and narrative.  They have a set of beliefs with no core.  It is merely people chanting the same mantras to each other with nothing beneath.  What is the desired end state here?  Their animating principle seems to be total societal collapse and mutually assisted suicide.  How do you gain and retain power when your beliefs demand anarchy?  No borders, no energy, no economy, no sexes, and they genuine seem to want everyone who isn‚Äôt them dead.  In the meantime, as in Ukraine, the plan is to loot the system.That guy SHOULD be afraid.  These people are the minority of the minority in this country and they damn well know it.  They also have lost their ability to conceal things from us.That shooter in TN?  Her anti white manifesto is now out, and she turns out to be what we all thought: a Democrat living out her murder fantasies.  They want us all dead.  That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve covered up her writings.  They will now do what they always do: find and persecute the person who let the cat out of the bag.Ukraine has always been a mix of looting the system and living out their death fantasies.  Have you ever seen that video of Lindsey Graham giggling about killing Russians while meeting with Zelensky?  They‚Äôre mad.The other problem the entrenched Government Party has?  They‚Äôve imported millions of lunatics.  An Army of future domestic Hamas terrorists marched on DC last weekend.  Those people have NO PROBLEM killing Government Party members who get in their way.  We know this because we know where they come from.Anyway, if your belief system is built on a narrative, collapse soon follows.

                At least twice a month I am in Ross and TJ Maxx clothing stores when out with my wife on Saturdays. For the last year or more these stores have been overrun with our replacement population spending money like there was no tomorrow. These people are spending $400 or $500 at a time. Carts overflowing with clothes and jackets for northern latitude winters, buying 3 or 4 pairs of shoes at time. I was looking for debit cards but these people seem to have pocket fulls of new, crisp $100 dollar bills and zero concern about spending it like there is a lot more where that came from. You can tell who the American citizens are because they only have one or two items at check out.

                Anarcho-tyranny eventually leads to all the anarchists killing each other.  It burns itself out.Most people want ORDER.  They‚Äôll tolerate a level of oppression if it means order.  The disorder we‚Äôre living with today will give way to order.  Whether it‚Äôs the kind of order we can tolerate or not remains to be seen.  The Government Party‚Äôs vision of order is gagged opposition at home, enforced by goon squads at DOJ and BLM, and wars abroad fought by mercenaries using expensive military hardware.Even the brutally repressive Soviets couldn‚Äôt sustain an unpopular war in Afghanistan.The TN shooter‚Äôs manifesto represents MAINSTREAM Democrat thinking.  She just got tired of the fantasy.

Yep, and that‚Äôs why they hid her writings.  Because if you read that stuff, she‚Äôs no different than the base of the Democrat party, minus the shooting spree.

            Biden isn‚Äôt Lenin.  Biden is the Tsarist system trying to maintain its hold on the status quo.The closest thing we have to the revolutionary is ‚Äì God save us ‚Äì Trump.  Because he is explicitly campaigning on an overthrow of the established order.  Lenin was arrested and exiled to Siberia for sedition, no less.If by some miracle Trump gets elected, meaning they haven‚Äôt jailed and killed him by next Fall, what comes next, what will be needed, is something akin to Stalin.  Massive government party purges.  There‚Äôs a way to do this without the murdering, but a whole lotta people are going to have to be removed from Government.2024 is going to be just epic, but not in the cool way the kids use that term.
