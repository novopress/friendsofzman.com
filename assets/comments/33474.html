        Nearly all businesses fail. Zero Hedge’s very motto is “On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.” Buddha codified the same idea well over two millennia ago in his doctrine of the impermanence of things, that everything has an arising and a ceasing. Ecclesiastes offers much the same wisdom with the famous observation that to everything there is a season.For all the hoopla surrounding Trump 2.0, the grim fact is that at best, he’s fighting a rear guard action against overwhelming odds. At worst, he’s the pawn of the usual powers behind the throne. The little guys (that’s us, folks) will get some scraps. A few illegals deported and the fag flags taken down. I guess it’s something. As for the “shirtsleeves” saying, the US and indeed much of the world is well down the path of that 3rd generation, the one that runs the business into the ground.To use on of Z’s analogies, we are still the guy falling down a long flight of stairs. Right now, we may be on a landing, relatively level and rolling comfortably, rather than down the next flight of bumpy stairs.

            I mostly thought Trump was there to crash land the plane, not resume flight. In that any relief from Clown World is welcome.

                Much agree; Clown World is our Victorian Age, except fake and gay.
Since blacks riot every ten years, could it be that women riot every hundred years?  Or perhaps, Clown World was the women’s rebellion against being lured out of their traditional roles.

            “Ecclesiastes offers much the same wisdom with the famous observation that to everything there is a season.”
Ecclesiastes was penned well before Buddha. Highly recommend reading the whole thing.

                I didn’t reply to your thing yesterday as it was late. This comment is helpful. I will try and be brief. Firstly, the linguistic aspect of Indo-European is solid. Latvian and Sanskrit and then Latin and Ancient Greek are descended from it. Your personal opinion doesn’t matter. Moreover, it is clouded by your theological/religious biases that come up consistently since you have been posting here.I think we all need to connect with this part of our history and biology because it binds us all together as a single people without requiring us to abandon any particularities – Westphalian nationality; religious creed/sect. We face a common struggle across the entirety of our ancestral and diasporic homelands. We got in this mess by blowing our asses off in sectarian disputes. Moreover, it has the ultimate time authority and legitimacy as that binding glue. It is way older than Christianity and doesn’t have covenants that mix us up with people hostile to us.I have no problem with Christianity. If there was a revival and Christianity defended us as a single people rather than betraying us to the other it wouldn’t need to argue. It would be accepted universally by our people. It shows no signs of that. Moreover, I am involved with deeply devoted Christian people. We get along and are doing the good work of building together what comes next. I am perfectly happy to live in a Christian nation. I don’t have to accept that faith or convert because we know while God is incredibly important, that this dispute is petty compared to our common cause and our situation as a people.Perseus is far older than Christ. I don’t say that invalidates Christ though for me he is closer to our source. I do think that Perseus is a better directive and, particularly in our current predicament, a better understanding of how we must relate to our Godhead. Comparing the two is interesting and instructive. They are both Indo-European in nature, but Perseus is more true to it.Christ was the son of an immaculately conception by God and a mortal woman. Christ’s prophecy made King Herod feel threatened. He exiled Christ in the sense that he killed all first borns. Christ lived on. His trials and act of heroism was to endure ridicule, scorn, envy, hatred, temptation, betrayal, humiliation and execution. His heroic deed was forgiving what he endured that man could be redeemed by the Father. He went to the underworld and triumphed over darkness. His journey home was to heaven where he sits with the Father.Perseus was conceived when Zeus manifested himself as the divine light, the pure Uranian energy, and bathed Perseus’ mortal mother Danae in it. His grandfather Acrisius heard a prophesy that Perseus was a mortal threat so Perseus and his mother were exiled. In exile Perseus vanity was tempted by the King who was harassing his mother. Respecting the hierarchy he agreed to a trial confronting death to release her. His task was to confront deathbefore the gaze of the dark feminine. He went to the underworld gifted not with endurance but weapons, shields and cloaks to assist him in his endeavor. Still he had to perform the deed. He killed Medusa and returned home and destroyed his enemies and having destroyed the telluric and chethonic feminine, freed that ordained by the light and destroyed his grandfather Acrisius.One faith offers forgiveness and redemption in a fallen state of becoming. The other tradition offers us the ability to embrace and manifest the Godhead’s light and energy. Through action we can leave becoming and enter being. For my money, given where we are at, I am with the son who through heroic action  will slay the telluric forces. But, it isn’t my place to criticize or try to delegitimize Yahweh’s son. On the contrary. I value him and all of my people who live virtuous lives in worship of him.For me, the most important thing is that these religious disputes are petty. Religion and spirituality are critical. I do not embrace the entirety of Our heritage to avoid God. On the contrary. I seek to be at one with Him. My reason for this is to get us to adopt something in common across three continents without getting into squabbles that will harm our mission. We will only survive as one people. What unites us? This heritage does. I am open to a respectful opinion and presentation on something else. Keep in mind, the attack vector is our race. Now, Christianity is attacked, but the official churches do not defend us. Often they attack us to defend themselves. So why would anyone be convinced by you if you are just another Christian who is also on the attack? Christ acquiesced. Perseus grabbed shield and sword and confronted and destroyed evilTypically, posters on this site don’t run around and troll other people’s posts. We may disagree at times but we don’t read minds andauthoritativelyrub our theological nuts in other people’s faces. I could have the tone wrong here, but you are coming across as dismissive and forcing your theology and opinion on people. If that is your intent, we typically don’t appreciate that. It may be best to bring passionate engagement to more topical and narrowly targeted web forums.

                    ” Firstly, the linguistic aspect of Indo-European is solid. Latvian and Sanskrit and then Latin and Ancient Greek are descended from it. Your personal opinion doesn’t matter. Moreover, it is clouded by your theological/religious biases that come up consistently since you have been posting here.”I deeply appreciate that you can mind read. It’s a help. Perhaps the linguistic aspect of “Indo-European” is just a bunch of academic theories that hardly understand language, let alone their interconnections through time? I don’t think that idea should be a scary to think about, regardless of my biases. Unverified opinions/origin stories are not facts.“It is way older than Christianity and doesn’t have covenants that mix us up with people hostile to us.”Europe and Christianity are intertwined and the elephant in the room should be faced. Most of your immediate ancestors were Christian. This wanting some other history that didn’t exist. Christianity has exactly one covenant that is extended to the world. Modern “Judeo-Christian” nonsense is about Clown World, it’s not historical or even modern Christianity.” Comparing the two is interesting and instructive. They are both Indo-European in nature, but Perseus is more true to it.”Again, friend, we’re about to have new Indian overlords. Wanting this theory so badly is begging Vivek Ram-alam-ding-dong to come rule over us. The car crash is coming on that .Further, while I appreciate your analysis, it is missing that Christianity believes that Jesus is fully God and fully man. Jesus is part of the Godhead. He doesn’t describe God, He is God. In that the model offered of Christianity is flawed. That you prefer some other person’s description of God does not deal with the extraordinary claims made by Jesus Himself.” Christ acquiesced.” – Christ conquered death. Europeans need hope, they need faith, they need a love of God. They need to think bigger than just their flesh and just this life. It’s the time preference on steroids. I’m saying that because the “Indo-European” approach has not only been tried, but it’s not working for over 100 years. It’s about ready to face the reality of the Brahmin caste now too.“We may disagree at times but we don’t read minds and authoritatively rub our theological nuts in other people’s faces. I could have the tone wrong here, but you are coming across as dismissive and forcing your theology and opinion on people.”If Z Man finds me annoying fair enough. It’s his platform. Given however, that your first paragraph literally is attempting to read my mind, I will offer that to me this mostly ‘Please go away and don’t say disturbing things” . Christians say disturbing things. It’s just a hazard of believing several impossible things before breakfast. I think it’s more than fair that a practicing Christian insist on what the religion actually is, rather than seriously deal with obviously incorrect academic strawmen.

                        Yesterday you said I am trying to avoid God. That is mind reading. Let’s smoke the peace pipe and say we are both guilty.I agree that Rama-long-a-ding-dong is going to do it. He already has with his Colosseum tweets. Balaji Srinivasan is claiming historic Asian supremacy though it is preposterous.This is a problem. However, King Cobra and these guys have zero claim on Greece, Rome or Europe. Owning an Indo-European identity does not give him claim. It is easily refutable.I think your concern about the coming Dravidian ruling caste is legitimate and yet another of the racial/ethnic incoherencies that this ridiculous regime has created for itself.He has no claim and it is easily refuted. If anything Persians have a claim over ding-a-long as after the Aryans came and conquered their sorry asses the Persians came next.If you are worried of an ethnos’ claim over us than why Christianity? Jews claim that God uniquely revealed himself to them and refute the Christ as the Messiah. Europeans were in the Levant as conquerors. Somehow they ended up worshiping a different God of a different ethnos. That is fine. But you are worshiping the Jew’s God who gives them ethnic primacy over all other people as his Chosen people. Yet your knickers are in a bunch over doctrinal purity that claiming our greater ethnos will give Indians claim over us. Again. If that is your issue, then why worship Yahweh?I am really sick of this scaredy cat paranoia. If we put aside our differences and religious squabbles we’ll stuff Ding-a-dong back in his locker and we have thousands of years of history and DNA to totally refute his claims. Let’s just stand up together and do it. Besides, the identity stuff is for us. What will stop King Cobra is a sufficiently strong cohort of men with will – no matter their faith.We don’t have to all be Christian to do it. If the vast majority of our people are going to unite under the Christian banner than great. I don’t see that happening. It definitely isn’t happening if Christians are going to sequester themselves and shout down any other means of uniting under a pan-European identity. Europe has abandoned the faith. So what are they going to unite as? Are Brits going to defeat their treasonous government and endless hordes alone? Maybe. I doubt it though.Let’s drop the religious disputes. Trolling and being supercilious towards others isn’t an effective witness for Christ and it is a wall we don’t need. Raise up your fjord under Christ. I fully support that. But stop being a child and having to be right over everyone else. Making strife within our ranks is how Rama-ding-a-long will usurp us. This childish doctrinal purity shit is getting old.I don’t fear Rama-ding-a-dong if we are united.

                            “Yesterday you said I am trying to avoid God.”I said the theory of Indo-European is trying to avoid God. I did not say you in particular. It was an abstract/theoretical discussion for me, thinking of both the age of the theory and it’s role in particularly in the early 1930’s especially. I make no claims to your personal journey with God. I apologize about it being taken that way.“But you are worshiping the Jew’s God who gives them ethnic primacy over all other people as his Chosen people.”I cannot say this enough. I am not worshipping that God. I will repeat again that your model of Christianity is grossly in error. What has been written to date is reading some gross farce of what I and our collective ancestors believed. It’s like hearing what a Jewish comparative religions professor who had only access to blurry photocopies of some badly done school reports, but retained all his hostility to Jesus, would say on the subject. I’m not thinking that’s your responsibility/fault. However, I’d encourage accepting that a practicing Christian will have it much closer to correct than the secular academic sources you’ve been trusting. This is everyday and every Sunday for me.“Yet your knickers are in a bunch over doctrinal purity that claiming our greater ethnos will give Indians claim over us.”I am not convinced it’s our “greater ethnos” to just to begin with. Ironically, I’m the one talking about European history here and our more immediate common ancestors. That said, my argument about “Indo-European” is as simple as: “It’s a dubious theory that places Brahmins as our most important ancestors. They will take advantage of that.” In fact I’ve already seen an Indian online wax on about all the connections. Once they figure it out as a group, they will be all over it all cheap sweater.“But stop being a child and having to be right over everyone else”I agree that people don’t have to be Christian to work together. However, I’m not sure how a calm explanation of Christian dogma, as understood by most Christians living or dead, is about having to be correct or childish.“I don’t fear Rama-ding-a-dong if we are united.”I can point to European history where many different European nations united to fight outside forces under the banner of Christianity. That includes the Crusades, then later the Battle of Vienna, and Lepanto. If you have not heard of either of the two later, I’d encourage looking them both up.And we can be united even without everyone being Christian. But we can’t if the instinct is the Jewish one, which is to tear down Christendom first before any other consideration and then come up with alternate histories and better relatives. How you are united with me without being a Christian is simply to be respectful of the religion and it’s history as told/understood by Europeans, rather than Jews and now, of course Rama-lama-ding-dong. Asking me to sit down and be quiet for the sake of a false unity is to only ask me to wander away.

Again, you speak from ignorance.  David Reich’s book, “Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past” (2018), covers the topic of migration patterns of ancient people and *finds* that the theories of the linguists matches his DNA findings quite well—you know, those DNA genomes we can’t get from “old” bones.

                            ” DNA findings quite well—you know, those DNA genomes we can’t get from “old” bones.”I’ve been clear that it’s difficult and expensive, but not impossible. Again, a 30 seconds invested into showing me that it is not difficult, expensive, and somewhat unreliable is all that would take. I’m introducing the skepticism that belongs to all scientific inquiry here. Solid theories will stand up to this sort of questioning.“Try educating yourself, then commenting.”You should be able to calmly correct/offer answers to some basic questions if you are educated yourself. Referrals to a pop culture non-fiction book is not an education in the least. I stopped reading modern ones ages ago as being lightly sourced, highly selective in presentation, and generally written to flatter the reader into “I’m smart because I read a book”.Propaganda comes in many forms. Modernly, it can be found in the non-fiction section of Barnes/Noble and your local library. Nobody will be able to publish a lengthy book questioning DNA testing and evolutionary/linguist theory. Jews/globohomo love all these theories and thus that’s what is the library.

                                “Referrals to a pop culture non-fiction book is not an education in the least.”Again. Basic ignorance of the science and the leaders of that science.  David Reich is not a “pop science” publicist.  He is the acknowledged leader in the field.  He is a professor of long standing at Harvard. His book is for the layman to grasp quickly what they’d need to read via hundreds of publications in the field over decades and obtain an advanced degree to figure out for themselves.  Of course, his assertions/theories are all annotated for those who wish to explore the field more in depth.A layman’s book is exactly what you need to read, rather than pontificate and spread ignorance.  That’s why I cited it, which is more than you’ve ever done to support any of your asinine assertions.

                Buddha had blue eyes, and preached some 500 years before Christ.I don’t know when Ecclesiastes was cribbed, so your turn.
What is a bit irksome is everybody rushing to give one group the credit, rather than claiming it for one’s own.

                    Ecclesiastes was composed by Solomon around 950 B.C., and took its ‘permanent’ textual form most likely in the Fifth Century B.C.
Budda the Bud died about 480 B.C.

                    Many here wants to have some deep history that is unfortunately not their own. Ecclesiastes was indeed penned before Buddha (who was Indian)* and is worth the reading. Any European before the 20th century would have been readingEcclesiastes. The deep history is there if you wish to claim it.*This is why “Indo-European needs to go away. We’re going to have Indian claim to be the next Buddha soon too.

                        Oops, sorry, he was blue-eyed and of the ruling caste, a prince…which means he was of primarily Aryan descent.
I do understand your distate with the “Indo-” part of the terminology, they aggressively try to supplant and replace our history; they did it at youtube, wiping whole swaths of archaic European channels and replacing them with ridiculous Hinduvata hogwash.
I believe when India was under British rule, “Indo-European” was in reference to the region covered by the Aryan migration, but it is an unfortunate term today.

                            The original name of Buddha wasSiddhartha Gautama. He was an Indian, not Englishman or a German born in the wrong place and time. Yes,I’m questioning the very existence of “Ayran” migration, but I’ve said my bit there.That said, how long y’all want to cling to academic theory that has that strong stink of Judaism about it in the face of our new Indian overlords is up to you. I can promise at least that there’s a working alternative that sticks to just “European” and leaves Buddha to the Indian subcontinent.

            Buddha codified the same idea well over two millennia ago in his doctrine of the impermanence of things, that everything has an arising and a ceasing.He taught “sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā” (all saṅkhāras [conditioned things] are impermanent” not, for instance, ‘sabbe dhammā aniccā’. See v. 277-279 of the Dhammapada of the Pāli cannon for the three marks of existence, about which some interesting details could be, I think, sussed out and clarified thorough a careful analysis withterm logic. Also, it’s by the way that Gotama refused to assert whether or not the universe is eternal and is regarded in scripture as the teacher ofamata, the deathless.

                Many times the Buddha was asked for answers to such imponderables as: Does a Buddha continue to exist after death? To not exist? To both exist and not exist? To neither exist nor not-exist? Similar queries were made inquiring whether the universe was finite or infinite? Both? Neither? And so on. Buddha’s answer was generally to say that he did not dwell on such matters, because his primary mission was to teach the Dharma, the path out of suffering. Even if one doesn’t plan to be a Buddhist, one can still admire his focus on what he considered his purpose in life.

OrangeMan hasn’t budged the True Believers (most of them female) but he has intimidated some of the dilletante Lefties into backing down a tad.For the U.S. to survive it’ll take a much stronger hand than Donald Trump the Dealmaker.

The phase we are in right now is that the sheer insanity is coming to an end, Mao is gone and the Red Guards have been put in check.
Trump is basically Deng circa 1979. Saner, more sober and more practical than the Maoists and the Red Guards, but still a member of the Party.

                This stuff also has a cascading effect. It’s not all Trump. There are downstream effects of White people being able to speak freely and voice their feelings, and their enemies know this – this is why they try to prohibit it. This is basically the entire point of the Yoel Roth, Susan Wojcicki, etc. censorship regime. This is why the Resistance was so fierce in 2017-2018, even though, as Scott Greer pointed out, Trump’s EOs and actions go wayyyyyyyy beyond what he did back then. This is why we had a color revolution in 2020, the regime could not allow Trump to have a second term – a second election would legitimize him after they spent the prior four years trying to delegitimize him. Of course, we all know what happened.

                    I think the way things worked out,(The deep state stealing the election, and then trying to crucify Trump), has produced a better outcome for Orange Man.
If he was reelected, he may not have developed the mindset to do what he is doing.

                        Agreed, like Z always talks about, they can only think one step ahead. They thought that Trump was permanently done in 2021 and his supporters were neutered forever. They couldn’t even conceive of a world where he survives the lawfare and re-emerges.

                    It’s possible that, if he plays his cards right, Trump could be our version of Gorbachev. Remember those two Russian words, glasnost and perestroika, openness and restructuring, respectively. Trump seems to doing more of the latter right now but the election results are also freeing people up to speak more openly about a lot of long-suppressed topics. So I’d say both are moving forward. What we are hoping for of course, is that these processes will run away and eventually smash the whole system whether Trump or anyone in his inner circle want that or not. This is essentially what happened to Gorbachev after all. We may indeed get our own 1989 out of this.If that starts to happen, I’d look for other parallels with the dying Soviet Union such as the return to focusing on the core nation and the jettisoning of the “outer oblasts”. In Russia’s case that meant the whole arc of nations South of Russia proper as well as the breaking away of the Eastern European buffer states. In our case, this might mean shedding places like Hawaii, Puerto Rico, other territories and of course forcing the Europeans to fend for themselves.Trump certainly seems to be talking about going in the other direction with all this nonsense about Greenland and Canada though. Of course, it might be a sensible strategy to doboth. Let low value (Puerto Rico) and problematic statesgo(looking at you California) and seize mineral rich places around the arctic circle.

Yep, the Dem’s legitimized Trump through their abject failure with Biden at the helm to replace Trumps—and actually Biden was never at the helm for that matter.  So much for rule by committee.

            “Overwhelming”? “Insurmountable odds?”Shame on you Ben. You’ve given up without so much as firing a shot! And hell’s bells – our enemies? You couldn’t ask for a better foe! They’re fake, they’re gay, mostly unhappy women, queers and lunatics. They don’t even need any help from us – they will destroy themselves in time. Look at California where the retarded lesbian fire chiefs gawp and stutter and point fingers at each other because there was no water in the fire hydrants. Fire prevention is only ONE essential service that has been pozzed. Like their neglected old growth forests… all they need is one errant spark in the wrong place and they’ll go up in flames. That’s how bad things are. You can’t run a family like that, never mind a community, state or country. The writing is on the wall. We either man up, or go up in flames with them. This kind of f***ery came to be because we let it.Enough of this defeatist nonsense. Recovery is remarkably easy. Putler did it when the old Soviet Union collapsed. He fired the jews and removed them from his finances. He tied the currency to gold. Anyone not on the team either got the hell off, or they suffered well deserved “accidents” and were removed.. He bit the bullet and almost single handedly created alternate markets with the rest of the world that can no longer do business with the USA. The BRICS countries work on the business model too.This is why the business model of the US is being copied around the world. The narrative is that the dominant political class in those countries kill their political rivals. I suspect the truth of it is that a lot of those people getting executed are actually what their regimes claim: back stabbing corrupt human trash like Joe Biden and his retinue of fart catchers. All of these are unpleasant costs that come with keeping the country on a fair and level playing field. At some point we will probably need to do the same.If we apply the business model of alternate history here – what we are seeing is just a corporate power struggle. For gawdsakes you lot – take the flipping win! Blumpf is bringing in new talent, he’s firing the old corrupt carpetbaggers – and he’s only been in office one week. Celebrate! I almost wept with joy when I saw that niggered Haitian getting stuffed into an ICE paddy wagon before being shipped back to Haiti on the news. Elon got massively ratioed when he told Americans to f their own faces because he wanted to replace them with H1B’s. The Old Guard is scared – and they damned well should be.Things are so bad now that they simply HAVE to change. The Russians did it, the chinks did it, the Japs and other former Pacific Rim countries have done it. We will do it too because we have no choice. The only question in front of us is how many people will need to be killed to do it. The message to the regime is loud and clear: we can voot our way out of this BS… or we can shoot our way out.That message is starting to be heard. It’s BEING heard as we speak. Have faith. I personally think the biggest fear now is of Trump getting assassinated. It is a possibility that we need to take very seriously and plan for… but whadda I know?

They control the courts, the police, the academy and the media. And they control those institutions because there are white men willing to sell their brothers out for their thirty pieces of government pension and dental.When the truckers protested in Ottawa, Trudeau and his “lunatics” and queers had no problem getting enough armed, white, male OPPs and RCMPs to cuff them in exchange for a pay “cheque.”

Yes, and you can see this quite clearly in how the U.S., militarily, tends to fall into the stone-age behaviors of their former continental enemies, such as taking body parts as trophies and demanding unconditional surrender.

        The removal of the security details of Bolton, Pompeo, and former Iran envoy Brian Hook moves them up to the top of my list of suspects who were involved in the assassination attempt on Trump. It’s not as if Trump is canceling the security details of anyone who ever crossed him, or the list would be practically endless. For some reason(s), he picked these 3 specifically.While the msm makes a lot of noise about the confirmation process for the relatively inconsequential Hegseth and Gabbard, they are radio silent on RFKJ. That’s suspicious. The major for profit consolidated defense contractors run DoD, and that isn’t going to change as long as they are our main armaments suppliers, regardless of who is SecDef. The problems with DoD are too systemic to be solved by a figurehead change. DNI is just a bureaucratic position in between the president and the intel agencies. She has no power that the president doesn’t already have, thus, if an intel agency is capable of resisting and stonewalling the president, then it can easily resist and stonewall her too. So her job is pretty meaningless. But that’s what the msm is making noise about. Making meaningless appointments look controversial. So it will look like the senate is doing Trump a favor, bending to his will, when they are confirmed. So they will not look like they are resisting Trump.But nobody’s saying a thing about RFKJ yet. They are keeping their powder dry. Because this is where the RINO senators are going to spend their political capital, denying his nomination. This one’s the biggie. There are too many rich and powerful interests, Big Pharma, Big Health Care, Big Ag, who he could ruin, who could allow his confirmation only over their dead bodies. They have too much to lose to let him through. And they own the senate. A Senate that will have (for the voters) shown its willingness to approve Trump’s less consequential nominees as noted above, but which will come up with some compelling sounding reason to deny RFKJ, so they can find someone more palatable to the interests of their owners. And the MAGA base will accept it (they hope) because all the other nominees got approved, it was just this one they denied.I’d like to be wrong but these are the tea leaves as I read them

            As Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi is central to cutting through the ‘silo’ barriers, and bypassing the Senate Select Committee on Intel, the ‘Gang of Eight’. Since Intel is running the show– superceding the traditional framework in the same way Civil Rights superceded the philosophical framework– Tulsi as DNI is more than just show.

        Many whites have a deep desire that humanity bind itself together as a big corporation ruled by meritocracy. Under this charter, we will have the highest possible productivity and deracinated harmony.
The problem is that no race feels inspired by this vision except whites, generally speaking.

                        It’s not as sexy but I’m much more interested in the asteroid belt. There are trillions (probably quadrillions) in metals up there. Many asteroids are “mini-earths” meaning they formed in a molten state and the heavy stuff settled to the core. Because they’re small, though, they cooled rapidly and are solid now. That means if you drill down a mile or so, you’ve got a layer cake of metals organized by density. The earth has lots of metal in the core too but we’ll never get at it because below a few miles depth the earth is too plastic to allow any kind of bore hole and of course you can’t drill molten rock.There’s another reason for asteroid mining which is that you can get resources into space without lifting them out of the Earth’s gravity well. This would allow all those giant spinning space stations to actually be realized. Currently, no one could afford to move the materials off the Earth. Life in a large spinning artificial habitat could also be quite comfortable with normal gravity and even some “outdoor” park-like spaces.

                            Pure fantasy.  It is not remotely possible with existing technology.  Not asteroid mining and not making spinning habitats.  You would still have to lift the total mass of any spinning structures from off of Earth unless you plan on refining and manufacturing the metals into metal parts in space.

                                I didn’t say any of this was something anyone could do any time soon. A lot of our problems stem from the fact thatno-oneof any political persuasion thinks beyond about a 10 year time horizon. This is what our wonderful legislators were doing (well, not doing) in ’65 with the immigration bill. Hell, this is what the supporters of desegregation were doing around that time. Just 20 years later, Baltimore and Detroit looked like Berlin after the RAF got done with it.Anyway, it’s implied in the notion of asteroid mining that you refine and manufacture the metals in space at least if the ultimate destination is somewhere outside the earth’s gravity well. Bringing finished parts down to earth from space is possible too though the large mass of ore makes returning it to earth problematic to say the least. In fact this is basically a WMD due to the kinetic energy the stuff would have on re-entry. In sci-fi they call that a mass driver. Not good.Musk and company are not wrong to think about what happens to the human race if somethingreallybad happens to the earth (everyone always uses a large asteroid strike but there’s a whole list of disasters that probably happen every few centuries that we aren’t prepared for). There are even “local” catastrophes like the eruption of Yellowstone, that could destroy the productive parts of the earth, leaving only third world shitholes.Of course, it’s somewhat ironic that Musk can see the need for human colonies off the earth but seems prepared to destroy the wages of White tech workers by flooding the West with Pajeets. Everyone has blind spots.

                    Oft overlooked in such utopian fantasies is that the new location must needs be populated with human beings. We would soon have the same problems, or varations thereof, of precisely what we were trying to escape. As the old saying has it, you can’t run away from you.

            The problem is that no race feels inspired by this vision except whites, generally speaking.This has always been the most baffling thing to me about shitlib Whites. To me it was obvious even at a young age that most other races didn’t care about meritocracy or the imagined racial utopia. Of course, it might be that imagining a corporation as the structure that makes this possible isn’t that far off. Corporations are highlyundemocraticafter all and can suppress dissent and internal divisions with drastic measures.The most obvious political parallel is Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. It was basically 3 nations in one, kept together purely by terror and tyranny. I’m sure most shitlibs aren’t thinking of that as they sing their choruses of “Imagine”. Of course, it may be that some of them are and that is why coercive, totalitarian wokeness has replaced the old-school liberalism exemplified by the slogan “I don’t like what you say, but I’ll fight to the death to defend your right to say it.”

        If you believe Marc Andreesen in the NYT being interviewed by Ross Douthat, the business of American companies are destroying American companies. Pull Quote:[taken from Ace of Normies]—Douthat: But they’re working for you. These are people who are working for you.Andreessen: Of course. So I had this moment with a senior executive, who I won’t name, buthe said to me with a sense of dawning horror, “I think some of these kids are joining the company not with the intent of doing things for us but destroying us.”They’re professional activists in their own minds, first and foremost. And it just turns out the way to exercise professional activism right now, most effectively, is to go and destroy a company from the inside. All-hands meetings started to get very contentious. Where you’d get berated at an all-hands meeting as a C.E.O., where you’d have these extremely angry employees show up and they were just completely furious about how there’s way too many white men on the management team. “Why are we a for-profit corporation? Don’t you know all the downstream horrible effects that this technology is having? We need to spend unlimited money in order to make sure that we’re not emitting any carbon.”So you just take the laundry list of fashionable kind of radical left-wing positions of that time, and they’re spending a huge amount of time at the company, basically organizing around that. And I will say, in fairness, I think in most of these companies this kind of person never got to be anywhere close to 100 percent of the work force.But what happened is they became, like, 20 percent, maybe 30 percent. And then there’s this big middle of “go along, get along” people who generally also consider themselves Democrats. And they’re just trying to follow along with the trends.So you take this activist core of 20 percent, you add 60 percent of “go along, get along” people, and all of a sudden the C.E.O. experiences, “Oh, my God, 80 percent of my employees have radicalized into a political agenda.” What people say from the outside is, “Well, you should just fire those people.”But as a C.E.O., you can’t fire 80 percent of my team. And by the way, I have to go hire people to replace them. And the other people at the other companies are behaving the same way. And I can’t go hire kids out of college, because I’m just going to get more activists. And so that’s how these companies became captured.—I don’t think this will change, not anytime soon. The workforce is not that flexible. They won’t hire straight White males. It will be diverse people all the way down. Defense people know this — Diversity Inc. Big Corp will not be producing any game-changing new weapons: efficient lasers, particle beam weapons to disable drone swarms. Certainly not at scale. Thus the desire for Startup Nation. Hiring based on merit while Diversity Big Corp Inc. dies like Sears, K-Mart, etc.

            Very informative.
These P.C. corporatists have been brainwashed in Woke, Globalism, and Feminism from kindergarten through college.  Mostly by white women teachers, professors, and endless administrators.  This is their functional religion, tho perhaps professing Christianity or whatnot.
They have little experience in the real world, so what they accept as truth is what they’ve been told in the classrooms for 16 years.  That ain’t gonna change just because a corporation hires them.

                    This is spot on.
Just look at the idea of reindustrializing.
There are serious breaks in the knowledge chain in multiple professions and trades.
It will take years, possibly decades to repair the breaks in those chains.

            If he believes that the college-indoctrinated young-professional “left” are anti-capitalists, he’s still fully chumped, a sucker for the Shapiro/Rufo/Lindsay left-flank-of-the-right con. No other group is more materially and emotionally attached to actual existing capitalism—to their own status within it. Demands they shout upward are pleas fortheir inheritance.If he’s saying all this because conservatives say it, insert standard black pill. “Wokeness,” anti-whiteness—of which “AI” and “crypto,” properly understood, are de facto subsets—isruling class consciousness, not student radicalism or communism or whatever shit. The young don’t decide anything. They aspire and obey. In the college example, conservatives are trained to see a reversed hierarchy where the teachers are afraid of the students, commie professors bully the administration, etc. This is exactly backward—a lie that’s been strategically cultivated. He sees it, or wants you to see it, in the corporate world. There too, it is not.Regardless, Torquemada was right about converts.

            It’s fine to desire Startup Nation run by white guys to re-industrialize the US.
The trouble is that startups require funding via venture capital and/or business loans.
Both of those funding sources are controlled by the DIE-invested crowd.
They will be in no hurry to lend to pale males.

        Rather than just making America a better-run corporation, I think a classic dissident insight is we need to become a real nation, not just an economic zone.Now that the frontiers and easy pressure-release valves have been closed for generations, our whole society needs to grow up and have the mature institutions and customs that mediate internal conflict and orient everyone towards the long-term.

        I just spent 10 minutes skimming through the comments. I do that occasionally to remind me not to bother reading comments. (I am old and forget things) Ecclesiastical Writings? War? Racialism? Mars? Trump? Maybe each of them are worth exploring but they are way off topic from the business analogy. What I was looking for was comment from somebody more knowledgeable about finances. The gigantic debt seems to be a freight train barreling down the track right at the U.S. standard of living. I am just a broken down old x-engineer, but I think the business analogy for the U.S. right now is a “bust out”.

        War is iindeed coming, the consolidation measures: Canada, Panama Canal, Greenland, possibly the UK are one sign.Certainly the Defense people (save the Generals and Admirals who are political creatures first and foremost) want to stave off any immediate conflict as we would lose badly with no industrial base, a woke and transgender military, masses of illegals soaking up all tax revenue (no military spending ala Europe), and said illegals being a Fifth Column in terms of sabotage and other actions.But this also means the Defense guys are behind “start up nation.” The idea being that having lots and lots of start ups, most of which fail, allows us to compete against a top-down China and Russia. I don’t know if that will work, but it seems the plan and the reason Trump was allowed to win and not be destroyed by a zillion late night ballots or simply a mass arrest of him and most Republicans with the Lightworker emerging as Dear Leader.I don’t think anyone is going to follow a Lesbian Archbishop into battle, that is for sure.

        The funny thing about the mouse is it was invented in a business unit in one of the largest corporations in the world, Xerox.  Despite the early quirks of the PC, it has been remarkably adaptable.  This was, of course, a product of IBM, though not the concept. The concept indeed came from the small business venture, I think Altair, but they might not have been the very first.

        The business thing is a reflection of the modern world. Western civ started in the ruins of Rome, became centered in today’s France, came to the British Isles via the Normans, which became the center as power moved from land to sea— the ‘British’ Empire— which moved to America and became centered on DC.Kind of a paradox, the trade thing and this reinvention being enabled by territorial expansion. No more new worlds to colonize, until we get to Mars lol. In the meantime, we have to figure out how to reinvent Western Civ (or maybe a new civ) as a settled, land-based thing, which is quite a task, but that’s what we face imo.(I think the Protestant/Catholic split is significant. The Latin world expanded south, Latin America and its new race of humanity likely being the seed of another civ imo.)Just throwing it out there.

                    Educational cartoons. That’s the quality of his thinking (and extent of his knowledge). Why do those say we’d go to Mars? To escape the ruin of Earth, plagued by the white man and his sin, his bad-animal drives tohaveand tomove.

Add narcissism (drugs), midwit smugness (probably sub-midwit), physical ugliness, compulsive lying (always caught, never punished), the royal toddler’s (or Reddit moderator’s) tantrum as model of authority, etc., and the idea becomes totakeall our having and moving.

“To Mars?”

                        Well, looks like we might need a little transhumanism and cyborg body sculpting to make it happen.  GMO humans, perhaps?
I think it was the sexually confused mulatto, writer Sam Delaney, who proposed “neuters”- scarred astronauts made infertile by their life in space. Breasts and testes removed as prone to cancers.
Sex with them became a thing–in other words, they were transexuals.

        Speaking of America, Inc., Trump’s revocation of LBJ’s old AA EO could have been done by any of the GOP Prezes since but wasn’t. The likely cause was Big Business. If they followed the AA guidelines, they were exempt from discrimination lawsuits. so they were perfectly happy to go along with the AA program and the GOP was fine with screwing their voting base to please their donor base.

        Off topic fellas – please forgive the diversion… but: I notice our Esteemed Blog Host is on Nitter. Is that the same as Twitter? I notice that many other of my favorite deplorable crime thinkers are on it too. So… do you have to sign up for it on Twitter? (Errrrr… Heil Hitler, Elon!) Should I re-evaluate my stance on those platforms and sign up? I ask as a doddring outhouse Dissident, or perhaps a “Dissident-adjacent” old stubfart flailing about in a foreign country that used to be my home, long ago… I love the dissidents, I love their rotten attitudes, they rude jokes, and most of all – their lethal wit.I have always loathed Twatter and Bookface on general principals but it almost appears they are under new management too, of sorts? Your model of America being a business is actually a very good one. Just looking at it… it seems to me to be a model that others are jumping onto wholesale too. Japan went from samurai cavalry to aircraft carriers and fighter planes in less than 80 years, After the devastating loss in WW2  they became (or, at least, WERE) an economic powerhouse. China is now on board with that model too, as are the South Koreans, the Vietnamese and God only knows who else. Sure, those countries have a different business models than we do… but it is mostly a BUSINESS model just like ours. I am constantly amazed watching OyToob vids about life in the Pacific Rim – when I was a kid they were all sawed off little chinks living the 3rd world  peasants’ life … but now they are getting around in Land Rovers and camping out and going on vacations and they’re right at home on social media living a lifestyle comparable to ours.Just spit balling – haven’t finished listening to all of this exciting episode yet… but I wonder: would a better model based on the mafia and crime families be a closer to the truth for an alternative history? Mobsters are business people too, essentially. They thrive in any economic setting they find themselves in. They bend rules and flout them if the situation warrants, they have internecine wars among themselves, and they survive by flying under the radar. People forget the jewish mob is very much alive and well in America and have arguably become the dominant gand, even going legit in many aspects. The crime family cycle seems to be that they go gang busters underground until they start preying on enough local, legitimate and law abiding citizens – that they get cleaned out with a flame thrower once the host populace has had enough of their chit.Getting back to Twitter/Nitter/Bookface… could the recent corporate reorganization, streamlining, and redefinition of their mission statements be a case of the management seeing the writing on the wall? I would LOVE to look at Elon’s books… and Zuck’s for that matter. Getting kicked in the nads as a business man is survivable… but a boot to the wallet can be fatal – even to criminals.Sorry for the novel… but there is a ton of stuff in this latest poast that bears thinking about…Have a good weekend you lot!Filthie

If this is what this person believes, what wouldn’t they do?
