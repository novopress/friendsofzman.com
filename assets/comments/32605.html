every time I do the whole early life thing, I‚Äôm thinking, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not gonna be true this time, it can‚Äôt be THAT bad.‚Äù But those facial features‚Ä¶
and sure enough. Maybe the antiseeemites are right?!?!  Because it‚Äôs like, what are the odds?

            I increasingly doubt the 2% figure is correct.
But even granting that it might be, wouldn‚Äôt it behoove us to figure out how the 2% (maybe) that are DR can punch above their weight, too? Rather than spend all our waking moments noticing, maybe start using a couple of those moments promoting DR? Trying to make it more socially acceptable than a fart in an elevator?
Or would it kill us to dial it back down to 11?

                What does DR mean?  Would people stop using abbreviations when they the don‚Äôt have to? At least use the whole thing before the abbreviation.I have no idea what DR means and can‚Äôt easily find out.

                Yeah, we‚Äôre all exactly the same, you see, so all we need to do is behave more like them. Problem is, we aren‚Äôt. The 2-percenters have evolved to fill an evolutionary niche parasitising Western nations. Even if we became really good at subverting the West for our own short-term profit, what good would it do us? Do you really despise your fellowgoyimthat much? And where in the world is the ethnostate we could flee to when our host countries become too desiccated to sustain us? Nevertheless, our own elite 1-percent have gone a fair way to adopting their methods; yet without heed of the necessity for an escape plan.

                        That is what our esteemed host would call a false dichotomy. We cannot out-Jew the Jews. We have to rebuild our own societies while separating ourselves to the extent possible from Jewish subversion, African violence, and so on. ThinkOrania. Think religiosity (discussed earlier this week). Think homeschooling. The list is extensive.

                            Tell me, what would you have called your introductory slander sentence, ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre all exactly the same, you see..‚Äù?
The problem with an echo chamber is that it tends to devolve into exactly this. What was the point of looking her up on Wiki? Did anyone in the whole wide world say even anything as trivial as, ‚ÄúAha! She‚Äôs a Jew! In that case, I‚Äôll have the grilled cheese instead of the roast beef.‚Äù
It‚Äôs way too late to waste time on non-actionable intel.

                            What I‚Äôm trying to get at is what is it about whitey that he cannot seem to do that? Gurls hire more gurls, Jews hire more Jews, etc. The only one who plays by different rules are white guys. Why? How can we change that?Are you certain understanding how other groups maintain their tribal loyalty is useless? Are we even sure tribalism is the answer?
It may be that it‚Äôs a matter of ‚Äúyour father the devil.‚Äù (If you know, you know.) But if so, how does screaming ‚ÄúEarly Life!‚Äù or ‚ÄúEvery. Single. Time‚Äù prepare us for spiritual battle?

                            Thank you Gideon for the Oriana reference.I confess I was unaware of that particular location. As a result, a Wiki post revealed that apparently Jeff Davis‚Äô notion of just wanting to be left alone IS possible. I encourage more to look into it.
It gave me a chuckle when a reference was made to the town being the only one in SA that was compliant with waste disposal regulations for their sewage. Whitey doing things correctly and well again, for the win.

            I was torn as to whether to put the transcript below the audio or possibly a separate page, rather than the posting area. If people have a better idea about where to post the transcript or think it is fine as it is, let me know.

                    Strong disagreeand I will easily tell you why. If I want to see the comments on the Friday Zman podcast I have to scroll waaaaaay down the page now to get to it. Transcript is long AF. Put it in as a red hyperlink and be done with it. Too much scrolling to get to Friday now.

                Love the transcript, Zman.  I much prefer reading to listening to podcasts.
And really love that we have Derb material on Saturdays when there‚Äôs no column from you.

                    I prefer to read it myself. But sometimes, particularly on Saturday, I prefer to be lazy.The stuff I need to get done today will still be there in an hour. I can just close my eyes and listen to someone read it to me. Admittedly, at 2.5x speed. I can‚Äôt be THAT much of a slacker.

                Transcript should be available to those who want it, but absolutely should not be posted in its entirety on the main site page as the default. As the other commenter said, it‚Äôs absurd to have to scroll that much to see content below it. No-brainer here, nothing to be torn about.

        Only two more months they have to hide her from speaking extemporaneously (only one more til early voting), and then after that they only have to hide her for 4 years. In clown world, both those time spans go by in a flash. It‚Äôs very do-able. One still gets the feeling events will overtake the regime engineered frames and narratives, but perhaps that‚Äôs just latent ptsd left over from the plandemic that‚Äôs talking.Not that I think it matters. Neither one of them will be allowed to run anything. However, the pesky problem remains that in order to maintain the facade of ‚Äúdemocracy,‚Äù you can‚Äôt fight a war if the president publicly disapproves of your involvement in it. So either he/she has to be your 100% puppet, or else GAE foreign policy as determined by the Vindmans gets hamstrung.

        Hopefully was a mistake, but the transcript should absolutelynotbe printed on the main page. Doing a favor for a friend by posting his content here is great, but it should not take up this large of a footprint on the site. I usually read 3-5 days‚Äô worth of posts at a time and it‚Äôs a pain to scroll thru all that to find last week‚Äôs posts.

        My biggest disappointment is that while there are all kinds of critics in the Dissident Right (DR) those who are willing to act are a tiny minority. Of a tiny minority. We can all bitch and moan about the power of the corporatocracy, but there are a pitiful number of us starting our own businesses, instead, going to work for ‚Äúthe man‚Äù putting money in his pocket that will be used against us, and we are left to the tender mercies of the corporatocracy.We can identify problems, but adopt the solutions of the statists, which are going to put me and small businessmen like me out of business. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs out of cussednuss ‚Äî it‚Äôs just sheer ignorance of the second and third order effects of the policies they champion.Want lower house prices? Reduce the barriers to house building. Want to avoid ‚Äúprice gouging‚Äù? Reduce the penalties for warehousing on-site to deal with completely predictable demand surges. It‚Äôs not like we don‚Äôt know where hurricanes or earthquakes or wildfires typically hit. But ask the DR? He‚Äôll most likely fixate on corporate greed or boomers or chews.

        Derb is an interesting guy, but this format just doesn‚Äôt suit him.  This ‚Äúpodcast‚Äù sounds exactly like a guy reading the news.  Add in his slow and monotone voicing and it sounds almost like an AI reading a news article.

            I have to admit, I just don‚Äôt like Derb‚Äôs voice much. Certainly I prefer to hear the Z-man. Maybe it‚Äôs just the accent or the fact that Z didn‚Äôt do a show this week. To me the slow pacing of Derb‚Äôs speaking voice feels like he‚Äôs ‚Äúover-pronouncing‚Äù things. Maybe it‚Äôs just me?

        ‚ÄúIncompetence‚Äù: the smokescreen behind which that malicious government agents love to hide.
My take on the Butler incident is that it was real hit, ordered by somebody*, and countermanded by somebody else. Trump was, probably, shot in the ear with a paintball gun.
