        Supposedly, TikTok has cutting edge facial recognition technology and their behavioral analysis algorithm is better than anything Silicon Valley has created.
Seeing that it is often said that all Chinese look alike, this truly must be an amazing piece of facial recognition software.

                Even face recognition software is ‚Äúracist,‚Äù according to those whose job it is to find racism lurking behind every bush.  The latest complaint was that Twitter‚Äôs image cropping algorithm wasn‚Äôt working as well with Black faces. Dead God, the Klan has even infiltrated computer software used by the most Woke corporations on Earth!https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/21/twitter-apologises-for-racist-image-cropping-algorithm

            I was talking with a Japanese author and the topic of how to portray infidelity came up. Because Japan is so ethnically homogeneous, they can‚Äôt get away with the old black baby bit, so instead they rely on blood type testing as a quick way to determine paternity.

                Yeah, knowing your own blood type is like knowing your name or knowing an important person‚Äôs blood type is a fetish in Japan. Also just about every Jap kid has a bluish spot on their rump until about ~20 or so, a genetic marker from ancient times. In fact, two of of my kids (who are all hafus) didn‚Äôt have that mark and the delivering doctor was concerned.

                Yes, I‚Äôve just read the part about race mixing in ‚ÄúErectus Walks Amongst Us.‚Äù In homozygous populations (a ‚Äúpure‚Äù race, long reproductively isolated), recessive alleles (traits) tend to dominate. These can be body features (blue eyes, blond hair) but also traits that enhance survival. The author does specifically note that in such a closed population, any out-of-group infidelity would be immediately obvious in the case of (usually) dominant alleles producing brown eyes, or that black baby, in extremis üôÇA child of two mixed-race parents yields a more unpredictable mix of alleles, haphazardly mixed, in essence negating much of natural selection‚Äôs ‚Äúwork.‚Äù Not mentioned, however, are the potential advantages to the cuckolding woman: if you and your partners are multi-racial, then the baby can be blond, blue eyed to ace of spades and all shades in between. Mulatoo breeding is the scratch-off lottery ticket of genetics.

            The law enforcement applications (esp after Covid masks go away) will be mind blowing.
Any city/state that has the balls to actually use it is going to be a law and order utopia. Or dystopian nightmare. Possibly both? (Singapore, perhaps?)
At least half the country (and not just whites) would flocken masseto move there.

        videos of chubby nurses dancing in empty hospitals‚Ä¶OK, this really had me laughing. As a medical lab tech, I can always appreciate any jabs at nurses. My God, what an insufferable profession! I‚Äôve known so many people who have become nurses, and ain‚Äôt one of them special. Like anything else, it is just a job. Some of them are great, some are bad, but most are just average.Like teaching, most people pick the profession because the pay is good, the work is relatively easy, and the hours are agreeable. Also, like teaching, they have an incredible PR machine telling the rest of the world how wonderful they are. Alas, it is complete bullshit.

                    I‚Äôve read that only heart disease and cancer kill more than medical practice in the US‚Äî not failed treatments but actual negligence and malpractice.
You‚Äôd think medical professionals might stop and ask themselves if they‚Äôre doing a good job, or the public might ask why we spend ruinously on healthcare given the results.
Everybody is smoked up when it comes to medicine. It‚Äôs another case of what‚Äôs good for business being preferred over the general good.

                        Have to agree with you. Also, I like to add that the majority, probably 2/3 or more, of illnesses and deaths in the USA are due to entirely preventable causes, such as poor lifestyle choices, diet, smoking, etc.

                            What is amazing to me is the incredible amount of health care resources going to extending the lives of people who have made, and continue to make many, many ‚Äúpoor choices‚Äù. We have frequent flyers that come in nearly weekly. Often they will get admitted for days. Long histories of chronic alcoholism, drug abuse, uncontrolled diabetes, HIV, hepatitis, you name it. Their testing can take many hours each visit, and that‚Äôs just the resources I‚Äôm aware of.All to extend their miserable lives.Of course, they won‚Äôt be paying for any of this, yet they account for a significant portion of healthcare resources. Honestly, health care rationing couldn‚Äôt come soon enough.

            My daughter‚Äôs hospital had a special day last week celebrating Surgical Technicians (once surgical nurses) as ‚Äúheroes.‚Äù She was disgusted by the entire thing. Fortunately most of her co-workers regard the whole thing with similar disgust (except that there were cupcakes!). This kind of crap is thought up by the type of woman that works in marketing or HR.

            @Outdoorspro I kept hearing for months about dancing TikTok nurses and wondered what the hell people were talking about. I finally watched some You Tube compilation videos. I am not a prude but these videos are truly disgraceful especially coming medical ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù. I am curious, when was pole dancing added to the nursing school curriculum?

                There are many nurses out there who probably did a lot of pole dancing‚Ä¶I‚Äôd say about half of the nursing profession (again, like teachers) are people who reached a point in their lives where they finally realized they need steady work and a steady paycheck, but didn‚Äôt really want to work very hard. If you‚Äôre that liberal arts major that‚Äôs tired of slinging coffee, then with a little bit more school, you can become a nurse (or teacher).The big problem with nursing is a complete lack of accountability. They can always blame the providers above them, or the techs for any issues that come up. I have never encountered any profession that is so quick to throw anyone and everyone under the proverbial bus if it means avoiding admitting to mistakes, or even relaying bad news. It‚Äôs ALWAYS someone else‚Äôs fault. They are relentless liars.

                My gripe with the nurses here in the UK doing dances on camera instead of working is that often use medical equipment as props. So I not only pay them to do nothing useful, pay for their ‚Äòstage‚Äô but also pay for their props.I also have to remind myself that at the start of the COVID event on this side of the pond, the government‚Äôs cry was we all had to protect the NHS‚Äî to the point where people needing their services kept away.In time even our supposedly conservative (hah!) Boris  realised the message that helping the overweight nurses to have time to learn dance moves was not what a medical ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô was all about. We did stop clapping for the NHS after a few weeks, though we haven‚Äôt yet quite stopped talking about our masked superheroes in hospitals: for a time we had commercials showing brave medical staff.But like most advertisements, they were inaccurate. The ads showed nurses working, not dancing.

Around my neck of the woods, like clockwork on Thursday at 20:00, a strange noise would arise ‚Äì applause! Then the honking of car horns‚Ä¶The hero worship is beyond comical ‚Äì I don‚Äôt suppose many who work there actually think it is valuable at all, perhaps they hate it. It was interesting to note that many foreigners applauded. But then again, if you come from a country with Congo level corruption, perhaps you think that the UK government is sincere in it‚Äôs mission to protect us.

            I agree, though my sister-in-law nurse has a special place in my regard since her work as a trauma nurse in an area full of drunken Mexican drivers and meth-head whites means she sees combat-level horror every day but somehow hasn‚Äôt lost her soul (you don‚Äôt want to press her to hard on how hard her day was, trust me).

            Any respect I still had for the medical profession evaporated this year upon seeing almost all of them fall in line with the Covid narrative.  Nurses have always seemed particularly ridiculous though since so many of them are obviously the same fat stupid cows who were probably standing in line at the welfare office before getting their certificate.

            Maybe. Google has never made money on YouTube. As much as people think their purges are purely political, in reality cost cutting plays a role too. Demonetized videos are nothing but expense. If they can get rid of those, then they close the gap on their income statement. I don‚Äôt see how TikTok threatens their business model. They would welcome the exit of the short video clip.

                The way I heard the market summed up is that Tik Tok is the new thing for the younger market demographic. Not only are the chubster nurses using it ‚Äì all the kids are. They are bailing out of Bookface and Twatter en masse because their parents and grandparents are on them, and they don‚Äôt want their creepy elders looking in on them.I suspect the war on Tik Tok is  part of a larger, backroom clash with the chinks. Picture Trump paying a visit with the goons: ‚ÄúDat‚Äôs a nice social media platform youse guys got, China. Be a shame if sumpin happened to it‚Ä¶‚Äù. The implication being that China has lots of nice things that something bad could happen to.A conflict of sorts is inevitable, really. The Chinks have no use for jews, Globohomo, or the pozz that is currently undermining western civilization.

                    Why do you think you‚Äôre any different than ‚Äúafricans and muslims‚Äù in the eyes of the Chinese?If you are useful to them, or viewed as high status (ie. High IQ university researcher), they will treat you well. The white trash will get on the back of the bus and fight with an African for the seat.China is based AF but their main goal is to look out for the Chinese (Han) people ‚Äì and fair play, no issues with that. As whites we need to do the same. We are alone in this fight and need to take our own side.

                Asians (both east and south) are not our ‚Äúallies‚Äù and never will be. Just because they have a low crime rate doesn‚Äôt mean they are on our side. They actually really hate you for being white and are intelligent too. Massive inferiority complex and identity crisis issues to boot.

Blacks and Hispanics are, ironically, the least threatening groups to white interests. If we had any kind of brains, balls, or ethnic cohesion they would not be an issue. Once Silicon Valley goes Indian though, we might never get it back.

                    Agree but only with your ‚Äúblacks and hispanics‚Äù comment: I can think of NO historical incidents where negroes or mestizos have launched a major offensive, especially naval, against a foreign (white) power. Plenty of ‚Äúcolonial‚Äù conflicts, where the European came to the indigenous‚Äôs own lands, of course, but never the opposite. Oh no, we (the West) brought this upon ourselves, by not just inviting, but actively paying and facilitating, the invasion of our lands by those who won‚Äôt necessarily conquer us, but will almost certainly be dead weight that will accelerate our downfall.

Moldbug was another that always got flagged as spam, but that stopped for some reason. For a while, anytime someone mentioned anyone named Fred the comment was flagged as spam. That stopped after a while. Most epithets seem to get flagged.
It‚Äôs a free service, so I live with the weirdness. About 4,000 spam messages are blocked every day.

                        Yep.  One should remember Tibet and the Chinese invasion.  The country is currently being genocided via the resettlement of ethnic Chinese.  Last I read there are now more Chinese than native Tibet‚Äôs.
Of course, Tibet is small, we are large.  But the precedent‚Ä¶  China would have no problem resettling their excess population here should they seize power in a crumbling nation.

They will have no problem raping and murdering whites.I doubt they have forgotten the British forced the Chinese government to let the Chinese people buy opium from British merchants.China will be ruthless to whites.

                    Welp, after they saw what a hackneyed cut-and-paste color-by-numbers job an Oppressed ‚Äòartist‚Äô did to Obama‚Äôs Presidential portrait, black America decided on a Chinese sculptor to do the MLK memorial statue.
Of course the Oppressed complained that MLK looked suspiciously like a harsh, brooding Khan.
Nonetheless, I seriously doubt the Chinese communists will advocate for inclusion and equality in response.I would mount the before and after pix of a BLM riot at the Chinese embassy in a gilded frame.

            In the UK, quite a big fuss was made over our 5G infrastructure being (as I understand) largely designed, installed and maintained by Huawei. My though at the time was: ‚ÄòWhat an excellent vector for espionage‚Äô, and it seems that many others in the country thought the same way. I believe that 5G installations in some instances have been set on fire.In any case, the government here rarely mentions the issues with espionage, which must be one of the long list of obvious things that our governments like to pretend is not happening. I suppose seeing that even turning my coat inside out reveals a label that says ‚ÄòMade in China‚Äô, probably doesn‚Äôt really matter we‚Äôve outsourced one more mega-entity. Horse has bolted and all that.It is endlessly fascinating, as well as sad to see the West hoisted by it‚Äôs own petard. In the 1800s trans-oceanic cables were laid, Maxwell‚Äôs equations of electromagnetism opened up the field to theoretical study, telegraph lines were set up. At this time, I would venture that Hong Kong was still the personal play area of Jardine and Matheson‚Ä¶ And now, we‚Äôre dominated by those who have taken up the call and pushed forward ‚Äì and they‚Äôll not forget about how we treated them in the past. To echo another commenter, we‚Äôll be roasted in soy sauce indeed.

            Suspect a mucky muck in the LDS hierarchy spoke to Mitt (or he was visited in a dream by Joe Smith hisself) about the implications on the church should a Ginsburg acolyte be elevated to the supremes. In no way is this to show support for Trump.I could still see him pull a McCain and give a thumbs down to Trumps nominee at the last second followed up by a middle finger salute.

        Tik Toc represents something Silicon Valley hasn‚Äôt had to deal with, which is hit product, in the western world, that‚Äôs not tied to Silicon Valley.  And from the country with the most locked down ISPs on earth.  A country that‚Äôs catching up with us on all kinds of tech, thanks to years of theft and piracy.  It also represents a watershed event in SV.  Those very companies, packed with South Asians, can no longer innovate.  They can only buy what they see around them.  At this rate SV will be as innovative as the Indian railway service.  In tech that‚Äôs death, as investors don‚Äôt give failing utilities near as much money as innovators who are inventing the future.  So like so many other industries in the USSA, they call their lobbyists in DC and yell, ‚Äúdo something!‚Äù  The fact that this deal was watered down in my opinion, may be to avoid some errant 9th Circuit decision that respects the property rights of communists (surely not us) that would have to be backed out by the fully owned, fully corporatized Supreme Court.

                Sure, but the ability to innovate is a relative societal trait.
China and the other NE Asian countries are improving their ability to innovate, even though they may never match the US at it‚Äôs peak.
Meanwhile, the US is shooting its ability to innovate in the face and throwing the corpse in the woodchipper because it would rather waste its efforts on critical race theory and World War T.

        The thing that really bothers me in this mess is Zoom.

Zoom also has China ties and was the talk of Wall Street a few short months ago.

Now? Crickets.

Even more disturbingly, my MIC firm has openly installed Zoom on everyone‚Äôs PC and positioned it as a Skype alternative for video conferences.

I wonder how much of our data is streamed to China on a daily basis?

            The NYC school system is usingGoogle Meetfor its remote classes (for everyone from 4 year old pre-k children and up). But is there really any difference whether it‚Äôs Chinese Intelligence spying on six year olds, or Google‚Äôs prying eyes?

        The empire has to keep it‚Äôs subjects happy.With Germany and Japan the empire could hand over large pieces of its markets and sacrifice its own middle class jobs to keep the defeated subjects at bay. Everybody  was happy and Japan and Germany in exchange did not rebuild their military.With China it‚Äôs different. They want our markets and they want their own military power too.And the usual suspects and the oligarchs have made tons of money on the China trade card so they hope to keep the game going but maybe expand to nations like Vietnam and other small Asian nations.India wants a piece of the empire too.india is not as adept militarily but they come to America and Canada now in droves. They will get their piece of the pie too.

        At a minimum, the cell phone is a highly effective vector of persuasion, and is therefore also useful as a platform for indoctrination (insidious manufacturing of mental habits). Cell phone video ‚Äúworks‚Äù very well for this purpose because it stimulates the visual and auditory centers of the brain, which can then be rewired using high repetition and syncopation. Rap is proof that this works and TikTok is a new weapon of propaganda and indoctrination warfare. Who will control the sheeple?

            TikTok and KPop exploding in cultural popularity might actually be a good thing for whites. The culture has massively change for under 21s in a way that is not documented by the MSM.Skincare routine, focus on committed relationships, focus on fashion, less focus on spectator sports, increased femininity and more equal gender roles (the Chinese way). This is all changing rapidly among young white people and is an improvement over idolizing rap and sports culture. Who ever heard of a skincare routine until recently? It‚Äôs all Asian influence.The negatives are, low fertility, social liberalism (not the sjw kind), weaker men, less ethnocentrism, increased focus on status markets. The Asian influence is taking over upper middle class people, while middle class and lower are still falling prey to the Ooga Booga from H-wood.But the culture is changing and it‚Äôs not all bad, but it is spearheaded by Asia. It‚Äôs certainly better than the degrading rap ‚Äúculture‚Äù that everyone is expected to follow.

            I have somehow made it all the way to 2020 without a smart phone.  Ditching smartphones is really the only answer.  I can only hope smartphones are a fad and people will get bored of them.  They have been one of the most destructive technologies ever unleashed on mankind as well as one of the most insidious. People have simply accepted they have zero privacy. They are even paying good money to put listening devices in their homes. They even pay even more good money so all traffic in and out of their house can be tracked complete with facial recognition.  People actually ignore people they are physically with to pay careful attention to people they never met and never will.I used to have a friend that even back in the late 90s would ignore people he was with to talk on the cell phone with other people.

                Sad but true. I stopped into a fastfood place a few years ago and while eating noticed a new father and toddler son sitting at the next table. The kid was desperate for some attention because his Dad had his face planted in his cell phone. So I spent an extra 20 minutes there doing funny faces with the kid in order to let him know what humans were like. I still regret not having smacked the Dad upside his head.

            Indians pushed Jews out of the Amsterdam diamond market. They are muscling them out of the NYC market too. Indians are taking over the wholesale jewelry business. The Imperial capital is full of Indian owned IT companies that serve government and government contractors. South Asians are going to be a force in imperial politics over the next decades.

                    In everyday life the Chinese people I‚Äôve known have been almost like us but a little more autistic, secretive, and determined. Their government is an eviler version of its people, as governments are, so while our sanity and ambition wane its strength as a rival grows. They‚Äôll probably calmly eclipse (and maybe cage) us as we go feral.Indians even at their high-caste H1B best are like stunningly ugly and foul-smelling St√ºrmer-cartoon Jews played by Jersey Italian rapists. I‚Äôm not convinced they‚Äôre meaningfully human. Losing our influence to them is like losing it to sewage.We can do both, of course.

                        Good to have doubts.  The high caste in India are the Brahmins.  That is whom we speak of when we talk of Silicon Valley and high tech Indian oligarchs.The average IQ in India has been pegged I believe by Lynn at 85 or so.  I think that‚Äôs a bit low.  The Brahmins are their ‚Äúelite‚Äù and have been called the ‚ÄúAshkenazi Jews‚Äù of India for what it‚Äôs worth, I don‚Äôt remember a current figure for IQ.  However, the number of Brahmins is less that 5% of India‚Äôs current population of 1.35B.My general thinking is that in a head to head comparison with China, China has overwhelmingly superior numbers wrt human capital.  In a personal, social comparison, Indians of the Brahmin cast have impressed me.  Most all I encountered were pretty good folk and interactions pleasant, but the such folk were always in a minority‚Äînot majority‚Äîin both numbers and positions of authority.  So what do I  know?Pick your poison I guess.

                The one thing that allowed the systems to keep going when Jews took them over and subverted them is that there are just not that many Jews.  There is a virtually endless supply of Indians to further subvert the systems and bleed them completely dry. There are more Indians alone than the entire Occident combined.

            What are they gonna do about it though? Indians are better at bullshitting, more arrogant, more nepotistic, and quicker negotiators. Unless the borders close they are going to keep overtaking the Jews. A Jew is just another cracker to non-whites.
Hollywood is bankrupt and producing crap, young people are flocking to KPop and TikTok. Sports are dying; eSports are in.
It seems to me that our fates are intertwined, and their decline will mirror our decline. We are the host, after all.

Another cracker with tiny hats and funny candlesticks.

I enjoyed the recent (((M$M))) stories bemoaning the lack of Holocaust knowledge among American youth.

I can‚Äôt wait for the wailing when (((they))) try and peddle their stories to Indians, a people who are just fine allowing their holiest river to be flooded with sewage and dead bodies.

Unless the borders are closed the Jews will keep losing. S.Asians are higher in every ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù trait than Jews are. A Jewish man is just another cracker to non-whites.

            The Nation magazine (as was) had a piece back in 1998 entited‚ÄúThe Harvard boys do Russia‚Äù. It detailed the deliberate collapse and looting of the post Soviet economy and the rise of the oligarchs.
The Harvard boys have been doing the US for the past couple of decades.

        Having nothing to do with today‚Äôs post, but much to do with what we discuss here, is a news item from Yahoo:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-wells-fargo-ceo-ruffles-164524292.htmlKudos to Mr. Scharf for being the perfect balance of Equal Opportunity and yet demanding standards. Apparently some Blacks are ‚Äúshocked and puzzled‚Äù and claim there is no shortage of talented blacks. Actually thereisa chronic shortage, so much so that in many professions a qualified Black actually commands a premium, just so the firm can ‚Äúcheck the right boxes.‚ÄùWhile not mentioned in the article for obvious reasons, apparently it has escaped all involved that there are decades of IQ and other achievement tests that consistently show an achievement gap between Blacks and everyone else. The gap yawns ever wider, like Nietzsche‚Äôs abyss, with increasing specialization.The world needs more leaders who are saying basically, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt discirminate by race, indeed we are prohibited from doing so. But we will not lower our standards just to acheive someone‚Äôs ideal of racial parity.‚Äù In related news, still no word on why the NFL or NBA hasn‚Äôt hired enough White talent.

            There is a middle way, commonly used, but less spoken about.  You hire incompetent minorities‚Äîwhich are the bulk in high tech‚Äîand then put them into ‚Äúpositions‚Äù where they will not affect the company‚Äôs bottom line by producing inferior results where it counts.  In short, a do nothing (of importance) job.  That is the current acceptable way in many corporations, a cost of doing business so to speak, but a drag on the economy none-the-less.

        I agree on Barrett, but I‚Äôd like to hear the circumstances behind the adoption as there may be a reason that is less worrisome.
Just here to say that there is no reason that could possibly make the adoption of two black kids (‚Äúniglets‚Äù) from Haiti by a white woman ‚Äúless worrisome‚Äù,especiallywhen she‚Äôs being considered for the Supreme Court.It‚Äôs fucking disgusting.

        Z‚Äì It makes perfect sense that Oracle and Walmart want TikTok.  Oracle needs some large tenant to anchor its cloud computing business.  Walmart is going to insert their product recommendations into the app.  Both see it as a way to compete with Amazon.  Nobody wants anything to do with Chinese facial recognition technology because it‚Äôs radioactive.  Hence the carve-out.

        But wait there‚Äôs more. The little lady asked me to pick up some boneless chicken breast on the way home from work yesterday. Was working in K town and ran into H MART. No breast out so I asked the little brown man if he had any in the back.‚Äù No speaking English ‚Äú he said, so I grabbed one of the Korean floor managers. ‚Äú no speaky engliss ‚Äú next thing you know their speaking fluent Spanish to each other. The alternative to H MART is the Ralfs down the street with 37 tents in front of it and kids with no shoes on and green snot coming out of their nose inside it.  I removed my mask and walked slowly out (blue Manson lamps turned up high) eggs and rice for dinner. Going to put in for a inter country passport and do some civilized food shopping over the weekend. Tik Tok is the least of my troubles MR President.

        Sure I can see why Oracle might be interested. If it‚Äôs true, something like TikTok could be used to generate huge databases of human behavior. The goal would then be to detect anomalous behavior in these huge databases, and there‚Äôs the people you‚Äôre looking for.
Oracle or any database centered company like them could sell a system such as this for fantastic profits. For example, someone getting ready to sell company secrets will engage in certain behavior that could be detected, and the person then thwarted. Insider trading, corporate espionage, you name it.

        To the extent that it would be usable, the Tiktok app may be able to access the mic ‚Ä¶ even when the Tiktok is not running in the foreground.  Some senators daughter has Tiktok installed and the Chinese could listen?  Safari listens unless you explicitly turn it off.

            Not 100% sure re TikTok, but if you take a course on cybersecurity and hacking, e.g. via your employer, typically one of the first hacks you‚Äôll hear about is an IP scan, where a hacker methodically pings through a range of IP addresses thought to belong to some organization, looking for hits ‚Äî once a computer (often a PC) responds, they show how it‚Äôs relatively simple to determine if there is a webcam, and if so to turn it on remotely.

        This is way off topic, but does anyone think that this site could benefit from a general forum for the exchange of ideas that do not exactly align with the daily message?  I ask because I‚Äôm looking at something right now that pertains to the entry of the USA into WWI and I have some questions about it.  I think that there‚Äôs probably someone in this comment section that is steeped in this history and can elucidate on this topic, amongst many others.  But I feel that it‚Äôs not appropriate to post my question here ‚Ä¶ so, what do you guys think?  Is a general forum useful?

                Alzaebo, appreciate your vote but it seems that, so far, it‚Äôs just you and I that‚Äôs taken to this suggestion.  There‚Äôs probably some issues with having a forum that I haven‚Äôt considered, and the Z-Man is smart enough to know what they are, so it is what it is ‚Ä¶ kinda like what Parmenides said!

        Consider the possibility this is nothing more than Trump brokering a mutually beneficial deal with the tech companies.
