        This sort of thing happens all over Europe. There is no protection of free speech, even political speech. When the individual thinks they are alone in how they think, they are less likely to act for fear of reprisals. But what if people realized they weren‚Äôt alone, that the majority is thinking (and saying in private) the exact same thing? Would this embolden them? The ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù cannot silence everyone, cannot threaten loss of jobs for everyone, cannot arrest everyone. What if people started to push back? To assert their rights as sovereign individuals. The State operates in this manner because the people allow it to happen.

        Let‚Äôs all say it together: ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm gonna be convicted anyway, I wanna be guilty.‚Äù  It baffles me that more people don‚Äôt see this.  If you‚Äôre going to shun me as a Klansman for being the weensiest bit uncomfortable with wholesale population replacement, well, guess I‚Äôd better head down to the local Klavern and sign up.  At least I‚Äôll get a bulk rate discount on bedsheets. And ‚Äî this is the important part ‚Äî I‚Äôll have some guaranteed backup when the virtue-signallers show up at my door and try to throw a punch at me.  If I didn‚Äôt know better, I‚Äôd think Our Betters in the chattering classes are **trying** to start a civil war.

        Stuff like this makes me wonder if I should even care about these attacks and the impending collapse of Western Europe (the countries in Eastern Europe seem far more practical on the topic).
It;s been obvious for a long time what‚Äôs happening: Hijra ‚Äì conquest by immigration.  Same way they took much of North Africa, they move in peacefully then breed.  Letting them into welfare states in large numbers is throwing gasoline on fire.

            Since Muslims have demonstrated their willingness to blast us to smithereens, I argue that it is better to be blasted to smithereens in DEFENSE of your community than as supplicants to Muslim sword-slaying.Therefore: Expel ALL MUSLIMS.And if the deniers still want to play prostrate ala Stockholm Syndrome, we‚Äôll give them a pillow and let them cry themselves to sleep. Miserable Pissants.Remember this, pissants: there are no innocent civilians according to Islam: all Kafir are MARKED FOR DEATH or subjugation.Get it?

                In fact, ‚ÄúBelgium in Denial‚Äù over at galliawatch discusses this very thing, that the more we are hated and murdered the greater is the outpouring of sympathy for the ‚Äúother,‚Äù among the Europeans, at least. Sad: recipe for societal suicide.

        ‚ÄúThey see it as weakness so they become even more provocative.‚Äù  Even a dog will instinctively understand weakness.
I‚Äôm not entirely sure that the Muslim invasion is a bad thing. The West was doing the slow Prog lobster boil to suicide before they imported the worst elements of the seventh century into the equation for good measure. Pain is a vital warning sign that something may be terribly wrong. Something has been terribly wrong since well before a million people demonstrated in NYC for Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.

        ‚ÄúThe fellas at Pegida or Soldiers of Odin will soon figure out that petitioning their rulers for redress is a waste of time. Instead, they will take up the tactics of the Mohammedan. After all, success breeds imitators. Burning down migrant centers will soon move to blowing up mosques.‚Äù
And they will get it wrong again.
The primary rage and violence should be directed against their own political filth.
Revolution, not crime is what is necessary.

            @ bilejones No true revolution was ever peaceful. Islam is evil, and to deny that it is will only make your ‚Äúnon-criminal‚Äù revolution fail. As I see it, PEGIDA and Soldiers of Odin are the only ones willing to not only stick their thick necks out, but also want to actively protect the women of Europe, along with Christianity. A bloodless overthrow would always be better, but that‚Äôs a fantasy when you‚Äôre dealing with something as heartless as Islam. I back PEGIDA and the Soldiers of Odin 100%, because this is war.

        This article in the NYT provides statistics through March 10th of this year that show that immigration is up by a 26:1 ratio over the same time period last year:http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/11/world/europe/europe-tries-to-shut-down-routes-as-migrant-flow-intensifies.html?_r=0
The closing of the Balkan route has disrupted the flow somewhat, but based on past attempts to interdict drug flows, my guess is that smugglers will find work arounds shortly.
If these trends persist (and as our host wisely points out, they often do not), we are looking at at a Bronze Age Collapse or Camp of the Saints type event.

        The plus for the US is that we‚Äôd probably be able to shut down immigration from Dar al Islam and Africa. The bad news is that we‚Äôd have to take in tens of millions of social democrat Europeans who, having learned nothing, would most likely vote for culturally suicidal, redistributionist candidates.  Plus our own nut jobs would probably try to leverage the crisis by pushing for more open borders since ‚Äúwe must show hemispheric solidarity against the religionist threat.‚ÄùI‚Äôm not advocating fascism, but I cannot see how Europe makes it through this without about a generation of authoritative government.  I think we‚Äôd be hard pressed to avoid the same.Re: the size of this summer‚Äôs immigrant wave: I am seeing absolutely no mention of it in open source.  Which could mean that it is under control or that it will be appallingly large.  Even the BBC has stopped its steady stream of tear jerkers about drowned refugees.

            It is all by design. The Implementation of this agenda 30 technocracy can only become the new world order economic enslavement by completely destroying ethnic European Christians and it‚Äôs decendants implanted in America as well. The Head of the CFR is quoted saying almost that exactly. Essentially he said America must become multicultural. It is blowing my mind what is coming. Deagle.com may have been debunked but the projections of population in US for 2050 is 60 million.  The traitor matter of factly listing the 2/3 pop decrease is a former head up of Raytheon or DARPA or something so there is that. I have 4 children oldest a teenager and 3 of them are girls.

                Could you get me a link to that quote by the head of CFR? and a date, of course.Also, remember that the Multiculti Meme emerged after the 1965 Immigration Act ‚Äî to prepare the way for demographic and societal changes Ted Kennedy avowed would never take place, as he pushed it (with LBJ) on our country. The MM is two-pronged (at least). 1) It conditions the host country to consider its own culture and history as no better than any other in the world, and 2) It simultaneously weaves through school curriculum to inculcate a raging hatred for everything that is good about America, most notably its Judeo-Christian underpinnings (Christendom), its love of family and nation ‚Äî which are turned into ridiculous notions such as xenophobia, itself a term devised in the very early 20th Century, fast on the heels of the new Progressive movement.The attack on our nation goes back a long, long way.

        There are those who will say the arrested man forgot one of the new rules of today in the west: do not approach or interact with muslims if one can avoid it. While there are many muslims employed in numerous places and interaction is unavoidable, the only way in this new rule is to be polite and avoid asking them anything that might be deemed the slightest bit confrontational. Terrorist atrocities, where allegedly one shouted something in Arabic before killing innocent people, fall into that category. Certainly one must not do anything to incite muslim anger and thus bring down the wrath of western law on one‚Äôs head.Perhaps the arrested man believed he was acting in the spirit of open and free speech and talking to an equal about matters of common interest. However the ship of freedom sailed long ago in the west, so he has been left on the quayside even if he never noticed its departure.

        It occurred to me while reading this is that the really big problem people may be having with this guy is that he attempted to actually interact with someone in person, instead of doing it through internet/ cellphones/ social media.Conversations between strangers in public places used to happen, but have mostly disappeared in the last twenty years.  One area of disagreement I have with the right is that I think the immigrants are really a symptom, not the cause.Severian makes a good point.  Totalitarian regimes get to that point eventually, where they criminalize so much behavior that not only does doing something perfectly innocuous get you in trouble with the regime, it also becomes a fairly effective way to oppose the regime.  The whole thing then

            That‚Äôs Theodore Dalrymple‚Äôs description of North Korea: Everything that isn‚Äôt compulsory is forbidden.

            Cancer could very well be the result of bad habits, but you still have to address the cancer. In the process of doing so, you can fix the habits.
That said, I think the West is finished. This is just the start. The migrant waves that are about to sweep Europe will make last summer look like a golden age of social stability. Imagine a few million people a year settling in Germany or Belgium. With there dismal fertility rates, the native don‚Äôt stand a chance. They will be wiped out in a generation.

                I dunno.  Europeans have proven themselves quite good at population replacement in the past.  The West as a liberal, tolerant, Christian society is over, yes‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll be the white folks who will be gone when the rubble clears.  Either way it‚Äôs horrible ‚Äî our options are Fascism or Shariah ‚Äî but as of right now, my money is on Fascism.  (Side note: Now I know what it must‚Äôve felt like to watch the last Roman legions sail away from the London docks‚Ä¶. that was as good as we‚Äôre ever going to have it, and things will soon be much, much worse.  I never thought I‚Äôd live through the end of an historical epoch (and, of course, I still might not)‚Ä¶.. can‚Äôt say as I like it much).

                    There‚Äôs a crowding the lifeboats problem, for sure. But,the food scarcity will push more migrants into the west accelerating the collapse.

                        Once the West declines to the point that bloated incompetent malign governments collapse, the immigration will stop.  Also, there won‚Äôt be fuel for the beggars to use to get to the West.

                Orwell may have been off by a hundred years. By 2084 there could easily be perpetual war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, with shifting alliances every ten years or so. Orwell had Russia dominating Eurasia but it will be Islamic by 2084, a minor miscall.  China is on its way to dominating Eastasia, and what‚Äôs left of the Americas (which, as Orwell predicted, will be one big police state by then) will be Oceania. The Thought Police will be in charge in all three zones, with the perpetual war being their means of controlling their people via fear of the other.

                    Nope.  What Orwell missed is the propensity for such systems of governance to collapse under their own inefficiencies.  Even without an outside force intruding.  It takes a lot of resources to keep such a state going, and tyrannical systems can‚Äôt produce as much as they consume.  In short they are parasitical, and once they have killed a host they dissolve, allowing something new to start up.

            ‚Äúthis man should have just punched the woman and walked away‚Äù‚Äì at some point enough people will realize we are being warred upon, to create a critical mass.‚Äì we can‚Äôt win a war on the defensive, it‚Äôs impossible to watch everywhere, all the time.‚Äì fighting back when attacked brings ruin‚Äì better and SAFER to take the offensive against unprotected members of the enemy
So basically, our asshat leaders are forcing a nasty civil war on us, and stifling any attempts to deal with it by talking, politics, or using the law.
