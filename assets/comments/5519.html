        It could be argued that all crime is hate crime in that the perpetrator hates abiding by the law and will violate it whatever the nomenclature.  A punch in the face hurts as much whether the striker has “hate” in his heart or just decided the victim needed a punch.  In the current climate it devolves to the protected class/es whether hate is an element of the crime or not.  Are  rioting, looting, the knockout game a hate crimes?  I take exception to a law that makes my hatred at issue.  Am I not free to hate?  Who can prove that hate was involved.  Is hate the same as merely not liking?  Is dislike hate?  Is (fill in the blank) phobia hate?  Is bigotry hate. Is pointing out deficiencies in certain groups hate?  Is homosexuality hatred of heterosexuals?  As I used to tell my children “hate is such a strong word”.  What a mess.

        Orwell updated. Crimethink, Thoughtcrime, and now  Hatecrime. The Progs have no sense of what they are.
