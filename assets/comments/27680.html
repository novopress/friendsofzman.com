        Z: “After all, replacing the normal stuff with abnormal stuff has been a boon to the franchise…”“In those two decades, the Star Wars franchise has grossed eight billion dollars… The most grotesquely political bits of the franchise, the last five films, has netted over four billion in profits. In other words, the more they jam their carny trash morality in the faces of the fans, the more money they make.”More likely the less money they make.  That 8 billion should have been 20 billion.  Also, with the more recent 2nd chance decade they had, the business goal was/should’ve been, to establish such an intriguing product that it could go on forever.

                Problem is the Star Woke franchise becomes like the WNBA – even if it loses money, it gets subsidized by other successful projects.

        The company ive been with for a decade is on the rocks because woke white women were put in charge and decided to turn it into a friendly hangout with no sales focus.  They thought customers dont like being sold to but like being preached to about gay politics.
But with big corpoorations with billions of dollars, their products will continue to sell because customers have few other choices.  Good luck boycotting prctor and gamble, hollywood, the msm, major league, nba, nfl, and every other gay woke institution.

            You Can boycott the NFL, NBA,MSM MLB, and Hollywood. I do . the great side effect is instead of the wife and I trying to decide” what to watch tonight” we decide ” who to visit” or ” what activity to do” .it was odd at first, when we canceled the cable, we don’t stream either. We did it when our now grown kids were pre-teens.we are much more involved with the church too. occasionally we do resort to reading .

            I get it wrt Proctor &amp; Gamble – even if you did want to boycott them, your alternative is Unilever which is just as woke.
But NFL, NBA, MLB – those can be omitted from your life with little loss – heck, even a gain.  Likewise Hollywood.  And MSM?  Who needs them with the internet?

        As I await liberation from mod hell, I will add that Star Wars itself is generally held to be the single greatest movie of all time. It really did not need a sequel, much less a lot of them. But it was great. And it was great because it was the work of not just Lucas and Speilberg at their creative height, remembering all the Republic Serials they used to watch on TV in the 1950s, but dudes like John Milius, and Jonathon Demme.Lucas originally had a 10 minute crawl explaining things in the opener, and Demme rewrote it on the spot telling Lucas he had 30 seconds before the audience would tune out.  Milius and others rewrote lots of Lucas’s script simplifying things and removing stupid elements. The artistic design was amazing, and unique at the time: “used future.” The sound design and effects combined with a Lawrence of Arabia cinematography for the early part of the movie were revolutionary for a non-prestige film. And it saved Hollywood and Fox. Fox was on the verge of bankruptcy when it came out, and Hollywood had been stuck in the mode of Dog Day Afternoon and Night Moves, arty but downer movies with very limited appeal.What Star Wars showed Hollywood was that you could make a movie that was broadly popular (very popular) with high values in production and writing and directing, that could make everyone happy: people paying to see it (a lot) and those who created it. Without Star Wars there would have been no Ghostbusters, RoboCop, Beverly Hills Cop, Rambo movies, Schwarzenegger movies, 48 Hours, none of that. You would have had the various disaster movies (Earthquake, Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno) and stuff like the Conversation. And that would have been it.

            Best movie ever doesn’t really exist – there are too many different genres to really say “this one is the best ever”.  Maybe for a particular genre, or certainly could say it was a milestone movie.

        I feel like I’m the only one who knows anything about this topic but I’ve always found it interesting how the music industry was the closest thing to a free market as there ever was.If you go back to the beginning of the 50s there was a very tight controls on the market. You had maybe four major record labels (Capitol, RCA, Columbia and Decca) and two semi-major labels (MGM and Mercury). That was pretty much it. There was also tight controls on the content that came out too. Like you would have a song out and all the labels would release a version of it to see who would have a hit with it. So the record labels were pretty much recording the same thing.Anyways the explosion of rock and roll circa 1956 changed that. By the end of the 50s it was pretty common for none of the major labels to have a hit in the top 10 at any given week. While Elvis was on RCA, the other rock and roll acts mostly weren’t on major labels. So you really had a sort of dethroning of the oldtime labels by a bunch of smalltime labels.I find it interesting how it happened. Was the music industry of the early-to-mid 50s that out of touch and unwilling to change things? I’ve read somewhere that Mitch Miller did great damage to Columbia by not signing any rock and roll acts. If you listen to the hit songs of the first half of the 50s – you can hear his influence on a lot of it. His whole thing was to make novelty music into a norm. Even on songs that he didn’t produce – you can hear his influence. I might add that even non rock ‘n’ roll guys had problems with Miller. Like Sinatra had a falling out with him.

            The music of the late 1940s and early 1950s was awful. Sinatra in particular was reduced to doing novelty songs about dogs barking, and he had been a big name before the War. Meanwhile the Big Band era had come to a close, tastes moved on, and electric guitars and other innovations including much better microphones for singers meant that the “crooner” style was becoming popular but as noted mired in silly novelties.Though Sinatra and Elvis hated each other, in some cool universe they would have performed together in Vegas in the 1950s as part of an alternate universe Rat Pack.

        Z-man, I’d say you are overlooking two critical aspects of the Marketplace and Woke, Broke.1. Managers care about getting paid and advancing, not organizational profit.2. The destruction of the heroes of White men and (per Drinker) the trashing of their childhood emotions and memories is the most radicalizing aspect (along with the removal of White men from heroic roles) of this age.Item 1: the bad old moguls like Louis B. Mayer (people went to his funeral to confirm he was really dead), and Jack Warner owned everything. They sought to maximize their own profits and power, and reliably fought the challenge from Communists and labor organizers. Bob Chapek and Elon Musk are different in that the latter owns Tesla and sees woke agitator as a threat to his rule, much like David Heniemeir Hannson (founder/ceo of Basecamp, creator of Ruby on Rails), and other CEO-Owners who told wokies they were fired. Musk is not our guy, but he’s edging off the reservation because the wokies and Biden Regime backed unions threaten both profit and control. Lesson: wokeness is the fruit of managerialism, want to destroy it you must eliminate managers in an organization. In favor of ownership or shared ownership. Incentives matter and this is the classic agency problem. Managers throwing themselves a woke party at the expense of the shareholders.Item 2: Just as Gamergate provided the impetus to Trump in 2015, so too has the destruction of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi (portrayed as stupid and coward to get the black lesbian over as the “real hero”) made White guys radicalized. And yes it does matter, because its someone who remembers Alec Guinness as Obi Wan when he was 12 and saw the first movie for the first time, mixed up with memories of long dead family pets, grandparents, maybe even parents and friends. Trash people’s childhood heroes and they view it (rightly) as a direct attack on themselves.What Hollywood is telling White men is: “You, your childhood memories, your childhood heroes, everything about you is trash and being replaced by better, real hero black lesbians.” Even and especially Normie gets his back up with that. Especially since the new heroes are indeed all black lesbians. Normie believes the Great Replacement because he saw it with Han Solo. And Luke Skywalker. And Obi Wan. And Captain Picard. And Thor. And Dr. Strange. And every other hero he ever had. It makes him angry and wanting revenge in a way almost nothing else can.

            Is this really happening?  Tom cruise, robert downey jr, chris evans, liam neeson, chris helmsworth, chris pratt, daniel craig, the dr strange guy, etc are all still blockbuster stars who hollywood cant replace.  Mark wahlberg is clearly taking advantage of his jewish ancestry and overplaying his card.  Dwayne johnson is in two dumb movies per month.  Will smiths movies dont sell anymore.  Michael b jordan movies only draw a black audience now.  The wakanda guy is dead.Ill concede tv commercials have replaced us, and maybe a gay franchise like star wars, but the big ticket sales are from white men and women who want to see white heroes in the movies.

        OT: Sometimes it’s just too easy.Comments on a thread somewhere:Poster 1: “All joking aside, there’s a mindset, unaligned with any particular philosophical school, which holds that everything that is simple is a delusion”Vizzini: “Anyone who tries to get you to believe that is either selling you something or trying to swindle you out of something.”Poster 2: “did you ever hear the accusation, ‘you are missing the nuance.’? Unfortunately, Hagmaier’s comment is true, as I can attest to from almost seventy years of talmudic study and teaching. The argument goes back hundreds of years, in the everlasting conflict for and against pilpul – there is an interesting Wikipedia entry on the subject.”Vizzini: “‘almost seventy years of talmudic study and teaching.’ You’re selling something.”

        what exactly is going on here? Like I feel like i’m in some sort of psychedelic trance. If you read stuff from liberals in the media – the vibe I get is that we are being run by some demaistre or franco type supreme court (go to @davidoatkins as an example).however if you are a liberal who is blackpilled, then going to the conservative twittersphere account like @julie_kelly2 – you will be detoxed. She seems equally as blackpilled about how America is being run by a bolshevik cabal at the DOJ who want to deny fourth, sixth and eighth amendment rights to J6ers. I don’t want a fascist or a bolshevik system and I feel like i’m being manipulated.

            What’s going on is pretty simple: American democracy functions by building coalitions. The coalitions currently in place don’t make anyone happy because getting elected is a function of finding a wedge issue and using it to splinter your opposition’s coalition. Consequently, each side needs to deliver token results to it’s activist based on order to maintain their coalition. Ironically, this leads to a fractionalized society that actually shares a lot of common values and a ruling class that shares a lot of common values (graft and deviancy) but has to make bureaucrats carry out contradictory policies because each side is throwing a bone to it’s coalition.

                I kind of wonder if I am being made crazy by the media. I have historically been of the left but I do think there are a lot of bad things with the democratic party such as high gas prices and perversion in schools/libraries. But I kind of feel there are real bad guys out there and that if I don’t have to worry about them anymore – then I can finally criticize the democratic party.I had always felt that there was real bad guys out there and I historically felt that the democratic party was there to dispose of them. The fact that the supreme court might overturn Roe either tomorrow or next week, my thought is that why is the biden administration letting it happen. clearly they have the ability to wiretap sitting justices and or find blackmail on them. It’s kind of like the “daddy, why won’t you get rid of the bad guys” feeling.To be clear, I think there is an argument to be had that there should be a 12-20 week restriction as a lot of european countries are like that. But it’s a conversation/debate that I want to have with people I trust. The idea of going beyond that sounds troglodytic.There’s also the fact that while I didn’t go to a woke school (I was in catholic schools from 1997-2009) – I remember learning in class in grade school that the arc of history is long but it goes towards things being better. My view was that guys like Samuel Alito weren’t supposed to exist in our country and that our institutions were to protect us from people like him. I admittedly had the mindset of “daddy make the bad guy go away”.But at the same time, I see a lot of really bad stuff that the left has done such as the mental damage that the covid pandemic RESPONSE caused as well as the push toward going green which reminds me of Trofim Lysenko. I’ve always believed that people have sort of a composite devil in there mind that guides there political thinking. At least that’s the case for me. To me, that composite sketch is a cross between Christopher Plummer in the first half of the sound of music and Greg Marmallard in animal house. My worldview has always been to make sure that those people aren’t around. The democratic party I assume is the party to protect me from them, but I also don’t want unreliable EVs, pronouns or anti-white hate. Or let me put it to you this way, I would still hate mandatory pronouns and EVs but I would hate it less if Samuel Alito was in Florence CO. It’s like we have the worst of both worlds.These are my honest views and I’m slightly autistic so that’s why I might come across as weird. Is my worldview an illustration of your quote:” getting elected is a function of finding a wedge issue and using it to splinter your opposition’s coalition. Consequently, each side needs to deliver token results to it’s activist base in order to maintain their coalition.”or is it more the case that my worldview is more based on my age and having your brain fried by screens?

                    You are struggling with the slow realization that all the positions you were told and internalized as true are complete lies. As many on the so-called right are also struggling with.
Yet still you maintain some beliefs as to good intentions from people who lie, lie, then lie some more for the sole purpose of manipulating the public to destructive ends and their own benefit.
Perhaps at some point you will internalize this.

        “The overwhelming majority of white people have been voting Republican for decades.” That’s where I have a bone to pick. If that were true the northeast states would at least be swing states, being majority white. That hasn’t happened. (Apart from the fact that the “R’s” haven’t served up anybody worth voting for.)

        Look at the braindead’s from the lamestream walk back their Holy VAXX a year and a half later, after all their hysteria:https://www.keyc.com/2022/06/22/natural-immunity-offers-greater-covid-protection-than-vaccines-study-finds/Saying the VAXX can’t measure up to one’s natural God-Given immune system.It makes me wonder what’s their next plan, what’s the stoyak behind this. A CYA for sure, but for what end?Clown world rolls on unabated. Speaking of walk backs ZMAN, I’d love to hear you walk back that comment you made to a question on your podcast a year back or so about how you’d VAXX if forced for travel. That really made me do a double take on you, but I understand I have my flaws and ignorance too. It’d be good to hear your opinion on that question a year and thousands of maimed and dead later.

            I took it under coercion to provide for my family. We aren’t back to frontier times yet. To many, this seemed like a calculated risk. I personally believe the shots are more or less harmless. Surely there are side effects in a non-insignificant percentage of people.
The real blow in being forced to take the shot was not physical, it’s the mental toll you take knowing you’ve been put in your place.

                I’m sorry to hear that. I’d take it your not one of the assholes who demanded it on everyone else. I know a few of those.My wife was locked out of employment in her field because of her refusal. It’s put all the weight of providing on my back, but I’m self employed and I’ll do what I have to do. It boils my blood these brainless, soulless, shitlib gouls forced so many to sacrifice their dignity to Moloch. Same with the mask. My wife is expecting in the next few weeks.

            One of the most striking events was that when Trump was President, rushing the vaccine past all normal tests, people like Kamala said that she would never take Trump’s poison.  Similarly, the people who worshipped Trump were exulting their great leader’s medical acumen.
A few days after Biden won, everyone switched sides.

A clear pill is to see things as they are.
The TPP was a bad thing.  It would have subordinated US  to an international tribunal.Trump said he would not approve it, he did not, and that’s a good thing.
Trump was a mixed bag, perhaps mostly odorous.  Signal processing allows separating the complicated into constituent parts for independent analysis.

                        I get the TPP was toilet paper as well as the Paris CA.  But when has the US ever abided by a treaty when it no longer felt like it?  Great that he pulled out, but there is really no such thing as a binding treaty with the US.  Honestly, I don’t think there is such a thing with any country that has the wherewithal to just say FU.

                    The biggest white pill, I think, is the fact that Trump’s presidency forced the elite to drop their masks. Their hatred of regular people has never been so obvious, which only encourages regular people to hate them back.
It’s true that Trump delivered on very few of his promises, but he was great for accelerationism.

        CNN, et al, may not be profitable in and off themselves.  The profit is made elsewhere.  Media creates the story and controls the framing.  Media establishes the meaning of events.   The profits are reaped elsewhere, such as banking, military providers, etc.
A market is the rules and the referee.  Media frames that too.   And their spotlight colors that way in which Washington makes sausage.
One may think that WWI was a horrible loss.  But to some it was a joyous achievement..  The Ottomen coughed up the Guacamoly Land into British hands and on into RothChildren laps.

            CNN (and many others) are dependent on the big cable/broadband monopolies for much of their revenue. I’ve mentioned it before, but in our town à la carte broadband costs more than the cheapest cable/phone/broadband package. It ties in to Z’s points about markets. What we have is a system of rent-seeking monopolies and  regulatory capture.

        Back in the day when people bought music a friend of mine was checking out with a half dozen CDs when she noticed the clerk separating them into 2 stacks after scanning them into the register.  He used another device to scan one stack twice and the other one not at all.  When she asked what he was doing he said they were paid to jack up the reported purchases of one artist at the expense of another.  While no one goes broke underestimating the taste and discernment of the general public, this is something to keep in mind when evaluating box office receipts, etc.

Seems like a reasonable guess. I, for one, would buy a movie ticket for the first time in 20 years to see that.(I mean, of course, assuming that “no children were harmed in the making of this film”)

            I don’t think it would make billions. Spielberg for one has predicted for years that a major studio would fail due to some tentpole move flopping big time like John Carter or Waterworld or the Postman or Heaven’s Gate. Studios used to have the cushion of: A. Amusement parks, B. Video purchase/rentals, C. Streaming. But high inflation makes going to Disney World a non-starter (and they want your kids gay, a major turn-off for most parents). Once you have 20-30 DVDs or Blue Ray do you need more? And streaming is in free-fall: Netflix laid off another 300 people and is offering ads now as they not only cease growing but lose subscribers.Netflix and the others are barred from China. That market is out. India has banned Amazon Prime streaming over content, and their people can’t pay for high priced streaming anyway. Language and culture barriers make scale impossible – a hit French streaming series will have zero appeal in Argentina or Brazil let alone the US. The market in high interest rates will not shovel money into Hollywood in desperation chasing returns. And people here at home have little disposable money.At this point even a competent Star Wars movie would likely flop. I don’t have $20 to blow on just a ticket. A family?

Even though I’ve come to figure out that Libertarians are worthless and lame, freaks and potheads, I’ll still always value the Individual over the collective. As for free markets, I see as much validity in the existence of those as I do man driving dune buggies on the moon.

        “Does the market serve the people or do the people serve the market?”
This is one of the most clarifying questions that one can ponder.  If you believe that the market should serve the people then you almost certainly must support tariffs, restricted immigration, reasonable worker’s rights, and some government intervention in the economy.

                I think that we agree.  The conservative-libertarian impulse to support the market is surrender to the elites.
Only when we have elites who care about the people can the market serve the people.  To the best of my knowledge, this has only happened a few times in modern times and we aren’t allowed to discuss the most successful example.

        I agree and I disagree with Z’s main point. I agree insofar as the phenomenon he illumines, both in democracy and Hollywood, accurately describes the present. Because of the–it must be said–stupidity of the white masses, Republicans can continue pushing the anti-white agenda of their Democratic confreres, and Hollywood can continue doing the same.The other chief factor abetting the anti-white agenda in these areas is that the federal government and Hollywood are central nodes of the Power Structure. There is no competing power source, so the exponents of the Power Structure are free to do as they please, and nothing brings them greater pleasure than visiting misery on whitey.My disagreement stems from retrojecting this phenomenon too far into the past. Prior to the 1970s, let us say, and perhaps even into the 1980s, the marketplace truly existed because the Power Structure had not yet coalesced, and therefore, competition, the sine qua non of the marketplace, was a factor. Films made in 1962, for instance, bear almost no ideological resemblence to the bilge made in 2022. Sure, there were Leftist films, and probably a few that snuck in the occasional anti-white dig, but there were also many films that members of the DR would love. The point being that because there was no formalized ideological monopoly in Hollywood–or anywhere else for the matter of it–pluralism existed and the masses, through purchasing power, helped drive that diversity.The same was true for the federal government. Believe it or not, there was a time when the Republicans differed fundamentally from the Democrats. They actually catered to a different market sector (white voters) than the Democrats. And Republicans knew that if they betrayed their voters, they could be punished electorally. Alas, as the Power Structure battened, Republicans, fearful of losing their status as one of the two main parties, moved leftward. Simultaneously, the Power Structure, in all of its heuristic manifestations, cowed and enstupidated whites, which made them amenable to Republican betrayals and de novo Leftism. We are now in the situation Z describes, where market forces no longer matter a jot or tittle because there are no real options for voters. The Power Structure is a chatoyant monopoly.

            Ostei:  Have to disagree somewhat.  While pre-1970s films might not have been as openly ideological, watch almost anything made in America during any era and certain beliefs and themes leap out to the alert dissident.  Perhaps not as overt or heavy-handed, but the magic, misunderstood minority, the plucky little guy versus the powerful businessman, the warm-hearted immigrant versus the cold-hearted heritage Americans appear from the earliest ‘talkies’ onward.And how can ‘market forces’ have had an effect on movie content during the pre-television age, when movies were the whole of visual news and entertainment (barring Broadway run by the same group of people with the same views)? It was the only ‘show’ in town.   Even in the 1950s, although things were sanitized for ‘family viewing,’ there were still themes and messages pushed in film and on tv.  And although the methods of controlling and molding the public’s taste hadn’t been perfected, there was plenty of effort put into doing so.As far as dems/repukes actually differing – only in very certain areas.  Again, there were certain shared assumptions and the misplaced trust that other, newer ‘Americans’ would share and abide by the same.  I would argue that any significant difference really disappeared after FDR and his numerous anti-White and pro-socialist appointments essentially overwhelmed the old system.That belief in the amorphous, natural ‘market forces’ is a hard one to shake for so many (including my husband).  He’s quick to acknowledge all the government intervention and ecological controls skewing things today, but it’s that same old argument – true ‘free-market capitalism’ has never been tried, but it would work perfectly if only we’d allow it to.  Of course, there are numerous individuals making individual choices daily – but that ignores precisely who is offering or limiting those choices, and who is molding how said choices are portrayed.  Who controls the information flow – and the general ‘zeitgeist’ for the idiot majority who don’t really read or keep up with real current events?It really does boil down to the mythical market’s purpose –  as Line notes, does the market serve the people or do the people serve the market?  If one is part of a real nation of real people, all the agents of state control ought to provide both the open rules and the underlying cultural pressure to ensure the goals and well being of those people are best served.  Of course today, people are fungible economic units, of which there is currently an oversupply, and the men-who-would-be-gods of the marketplace are busily working to alter the numbers.

One of the most recurrent themes is the misunderstood stranger.  A stranger shows up who has suspicious qualities.  The townsfolk are initially standoffish and then judgmental.
Some sort of the crisis occurs to the town and the stranger saves the day.  The judgmental townsfolk are shamed for their discrimination and learn a value lesson about tolerance.
Who does this narrative serve?

Even the theoretically ‘subtle’ use of shaming the natural distrust of the stranger or prejudging anyone is clearly aimed at softening and fertilizing the ground for the pernicious seed that followed.

                        There is an agatha christie book where one character mentions in an aside that in their youth new arrivals in a village usually had to come with an introduction letter and provide some personal connection to the place in order to move in.
I wonder if that was common in many parts of the anglo sphere early on and that was partially the purpose to change those sort of views in media of the time.

                        Line – The more I think about it, the more insightful your comment really is  Think about all the old children’s rhymes or fairy tales or old village songs – everything taught one to be wary of the stranger, to not get taken in by trusting too easily.  It was hard lesson learned by people who passed that on in folk wisdom.Certain people who predominated in Hollywood and all forms of modern media turned that on its head – to instead always welcome the stranger because he was both the same as you and simultaneously better.  Both equal and special.There’s nothing new under the sun.

                You correctly note certain fairly mild Lefty themes in older films. However, those were almost always countered by others such as patriotism (a good enough thing when America was actually America), distinct sex roles with the man typically in the ascendant, white masculinity, “family values,” pride in Western/Christian history and heritage, etc. As I noted, Leftist films existed, but so did many others, and this is symptomatic of market forces. Note that if the masses were offended by the films, they could simply have stayed at home, read their books and listened to their radios. Likewise, the could have and apparently did patronize “conservative” films at the expense of Leftist ones. The Western genre is the most obvious example.

                    Ostei:  The masses weren’t offended by the films because – at least initially – the subversive themes were quite subtle and incremental.  And yes, people demonstrated their preferences by the obvious popularity of the Western genre.  But their choices were circumscribed by the movie makers – recall the literally international uproar about “Birth of a Nation.”  And the ‘picture show’ was the only game in town for a nation living through a dreary and difficult depression.   That’s not the magic ‘free market’ in action.

                        There may not have been many visual entertainment options in the 30s, but the films of that era were hardly in the class of Get Out or the Star Wars flicks, consequently there is not much of an argument to be made in favor of  ideology overriding the market. The anti-white ideological monopoly simply didn’t exist at that time. Not even close.

Tribal priming of society right there. Amazing how they’re always two steps ahead. Don’t worry, with enough votes we’ll catch up maybe a step!
Our “free market” is nothing but one big tax farm, 1865 and the 13th just moved whitey on to the plantation. The civil rights act and all shit since is just to hammer it home on whitey.

        When you live on the move, with your kids at school and your parents in another state, without even a tribe like a Bedouin, what’s constant is the screen. I haven’t fleshed out that idea, but I’m certain it’s true because of all the boomers I see staring at the TV, young people staring at their phones. These are people looking for connection, belonging, themselves.And that’s where they receive the Word. I wonder how many people mocking the Sky Father have a Baby Yoda sticker on the Subaru.Hipsters would claim self-awareness and irony. They know how fake it is, how irretrievably screwed up everything is. I say it’s the mark of a broken spirit who knows he believes lies and still can’t help believing them, because it’s easier that way.Yes, it is easier. Getting off your knees is difficult, but that’s life, that’s living. Expensive ride, but worth it.

            The New York Stock Exchange is a “marketplace” in the same way that a rigged casino is a “marketplace”. You have TPTB that know which direction the market is going because they own all the leverage that determines which way it goes. Then you have the people that know people that know TPTB that get in on insider info and clean up. Then you have the regular smoes that are betting the gods will favor them and the market will go in the direction they are betting. They may read some mass publications that all spell out the same strategies, but it is still a crap shoot for them.

        This post is over the target on the market part. America was supposed to be a place where market interactions, not government and political engagement, would be the primary means of negotiating life. Of course, a moral and virtuous citizenry was necessary. They addressed the moral dimension of civilization too. If government is small, then the market forces individuals to be disciplined and virtuous because the reality of success and failure without recourse to your fellow citizens via the legalized theft of democracy is the ultimate incentive.This is not a marketplace in any sense of the word or intention. Fiat interest rates are the ring of power at the heart of Mordor. The rot whose shadow grows darker and darker by the day.As for the culture. The powers that be are not making art. They see an, “installed base”, and a rainbow of races and ethnicities to market to the globe with the minimum investment.Art and artists is rare, and great art and artists are even more rare. The channel for serious artists is there in the Internet, but the pay so small vs. making product it will be hard to find art. For great art, we are going to have to return to the days of patronage. The good news for us is, art is truth – use of fiction to tell the truth and provide deep insight. On our side, we have that critical ingredient. There is talent out here in need of patrons who want to make great art to be made. I think we are very good about moaning and complaining. If/when we get good at identifying, promoting and supporting the greatness that surely lies within our ranks we will make a lot more progress and win a lot more hearts and minds.

            “Art” is even more corrupted than the “market”  When the cleaning lady accidentally throws out the “art,” mistaking it for rubbish, is it art in any real sense?
Art is supposed to uplift the spirit and to inspire men to greatness.  Much, if not the outright majority of art produced today makes people depressed and possibly suicidal.  Some of the “art” being produced today is so bad that I have to think they are just trolling us.

                    Yeah its mostly a scam, I agree with TT above the majority of it is just garbage. I assumed all the art critics were in on the scam but one night I saw a documentary by Robert Hughes, he called modern art, A cruddy game. and did a very good job of making wankers of the art world look like idiots, he interviews one clown who owns 800 Warhol “paintings” it turns out that this guy has to bid on almost any Warhol “painting” that ends up being auctioned, he needs to prop up the price to support his investmentLeft wing normies seem to love Banksy, they think he’s some kind of deep thinking genius, at best he’s a sometimes clever graffiti artist, this is not artAnyway the documentary was called, The Mona Lisa curse, if you can find it online, its well worth a watchWould love to see the sculpture below in person some day, now that is arthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiwNeseAT2k

            Calling something art and calling someone an artist does not make that think art nor that person is an artist. In the degenerate phase of progressivism superlatives and self annoinment is rampant.I suffered through several conservatories where the modern music and the modern art that accompanied it was garbage. Its only value as time moves on will be as a chronicle of the decadence, degenerracy and mental illness celebrated in the progressive era.That said, there are artists out here making art. It is just getting it surfaced is difficult in an era of mass imitation where what is imitated is not worth imitating.We need to stand for something and we need to hold the banner high. There are things of great beauty, transcendent truth and exquisite craft being made. My proposal is that our community can identify, promote and support it. Being the standard bearers brings legitimacy.Here are a couple of examples with potential:https://www.justinhughesart.com/portfolio?pgid=kjb6elj5-e93f54ac-fec5-4e04-9ee1-6751cf85940fhttps://youtu.be/fKvcn_JoMZAWe can’t just say what is wrong. We have to lead buy showing our superiority through our works. They destroy, uplift the ugly and despoil. We build, display the magnificent and illuminate.

        “In other words, in a democratic society it is not the marketplace but the moral space that decides.” – And this is why, in democratic societies, all art becomes base and stunted.  The only art created in a moral space must be reverent and an adornment of the moral space itself and the set of morals derived.  If democracy is the moral space, then what is democracy at its core?  The elevation of inferiors to power.  People who, had nature run its course, never would have had a political voice, many of whom are unfit for survival in. a brutal world.  Art is supposed to elevate the OPPOSITE of this proposition.Art worships the strong, the majestic, the perfect form, human, natural, supernatural or otherwise.  In nature truth is strong and lies are weak.  Human beings, being of nature, respond to this.  Democracy flips this on its head.  Art becomes anti-art.  In Christianity itself, only a hundred years of a democratic backdrop have turned Christ himself into a degenerate, weak, hppie anti-christ.

        Great essay, Mr. Z.Don’t take investment advice from your invisible friend Moe from the Internet, but “the market” does exist.  It is like gravity and a rocket/ airplane/ sky-diving: you can avoid it for a while, you can enjoy the rush, but eventually you have to return to earth.In the 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, it was understood on Wall Street that every few years there would be a correction and 20-30% of a banks staff would be laid off, a few firms wouldn’t make it and a few insiders would become gonzo rich.Since the collapse in ’08, for 14 friggin years, the market has gone up (2020 Covid dip doesn’t count).  Does America make more stuff than we did in ’08?  No.  Are workers more efficient than in ’08?  Is the human capital of US residents superior?  Any new inventions or labor saving devices?The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid.  But ignore it at your peril.

        One of my old stunt buddies got hired to work on a Sony Production recently. They told him he had to go to a specific lab for a COVID test on the first day he was going to work. The lab was an hour from his home-when he got there the lab said they don’t have a Sony account. He called the production office and they told him that he had to pay for the test. He called the producer who hired him and told him to fck off.

        I don’t know if Disney is doing so well these days. They had an attempted coup on their CEO by the Pixar people, whose newest movie is likely to lose $200 million or more since they turned into a culture war thing and not the kids’ movie it’s supposed to be.I’ve heard anecdotally from friends of mine who’ve gone to Disney parks that customer service has gone to hell with tons of temp visa foreigners now making up the work staff and that lines are long and food prices are even more sky-high than usual.ESPN is a sucking chest wound on their balance sheet, with billions owed to sportsball leagues for broadcast rights. With so many people cutting the cord, ESPN is a deadman walking that they’ll likely unload to Amazon if they’re lucky.Their Obi-Wan series, which was teased for years, has been a dull disappointment as evidenced by them playing the race card right out of the gate over the laser sword-wielding black prison yard lesbian who is the diverse real center of the series.The attempted coup was over Florida’s anti-groomer bill, which only restricts grooming up to age 9. After that, the laws says go for it, blue-haired, fishing-tackle-in-the-face festooned teachers inculcated in the latest fads from the ruling class at the indoctrination centers called universities.I agree with our host that all “free” markets end in monopoly. Most of the time, these are because the power players buy politicians and rig the regulatory and statutory apparatus to their benefit and to the detriment of their competitors. As they gain more market share, they gain more power. See Amazon, which wouldn’t exist without the U.S. Postal Service and lots of special tax breaks at both the state and federal level.For defense contractors, Dick Cheney had the infamous “last supper” at the end of the Cold War to let some of the unfavored contractors know they had to merge or else, like Grumman, a company he detested for some reason. Because of Dick, our aircraft carriers have Super Hornet strike fighter aircraft that are seriously lacking in range and capabilities compared to the planes (the F-14s and A-6s) they replaced. That’s a big problem in the Pacific.He derided the F-14 as “1960s technology” even though an updated Tomcat would’ve been one of the world’s best fighter/attack aircraft up there with the F-15E, which is also “1960s technology” since it is of the same vintage.Now we’re down to two companies that can build combat aircraft, one tank manufacturer and two shipyards that can build major combatants (with one of them the only one that can build aircraft carriers). There’s no way to break this monopoly, just like with the automakers, except with the favored EVs of course.

            Speaking of the F-14, former RIO (radar intercept officer) Ward Carroll has a great video up about the proposed F-21 Super Tomcat:
https://youtu.be/CpXyYgL4jPI
An F-21 with modern avionics, electronics, engines, and materials coupled with a similarly updated AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missile would be a peerless fleet air defense and long-range interceptor.
One has to wonder if the Navy is eyeballing the longevity and major updates the Air Force is doing on the F-15 because its fundamental design was so good.

After they’ve screened it in the US and Europe, it will make its way to the rest of the world, with the lesbo scene cut. It will be watched on streaming services. Toys will still be bought at Christmas time. It may not make its money back in the first year, but over time, it will probably make a profit. And you can’t put a price on perverting young children, can you?

                Disney’s stock price is half of what it was a year ago.  The theme park business has been amazingly resilient considering how much it costs and what an awful experience it has turned into.  They opened a Star Wars themed hotel and charged outrageous rates for overgrown children to stay there and play pretend.  It has been ripped as a terrible experience, but the Star Wars suckers are still going to go.  I see their problems as more long term, if they can’t indoctrinate the next generation into stupid levels of fandom like they have with a lot of 25-40 year olds today.

                Anonymous White Male:  That it took until the Florida grooming controversy to wake up so many parents to the reality of modern Disney is a scandal in itself.  They’ve been anti-Christian morality and inserting open sexual innuendo in movies for decades.  Even the original Buzz Lightyear movie, which my younger son loved, very deliberately featured a family with NO visible father  . . . ever.  And plenty of both my sons’ Christian schoolmates’ parents thought anything Disney – movies and merchandise – was ‘family friendly.’  People are idiots.

            On the primary/secondary education front things could get interesting after the recent Supreme Court decision that education vouchers, i.e. tax funds, can be spent (without discrimination against them) on non-public schools assuming that basic standards are in place. This gives a green light for parents to ditch the pervert grooming in the public schools, and to elect to spend their taxes elsewhere. This is potentially a big blow against the CRT/groomer program currently in place.

                JerseyJeffersonian:  And just who determines those ‘basic standards’?  Even before I pulled my younger son out of Christian school, they were all happily advertising their teachers were fully credentialed by the state and had all been molded by the same state-approved teachers colleges.  And they were quick to change their academic and sports calendar to correspond with every new public school and non-Christian religious holiday. And they changed the curriculum to be more inclusive.Christian schools are generally a massive lobby today and they’re really nothing more than a parallel of the public schools with a helping of “Jesus loves all the little children” sprinkled on top.

                    Well, maybe getting some control over money taken from you by the taxing authorities could count as a bit of a plus. People have been fighting for vouchering for educational purposes for quite a while. Access to vouchers may not be uniform, but access to “good schools” isn’t either, and parents pay attention to that in determining where they live.Of course, you could home school, in which caseallof your school taxes remains with the State’s preferred recipient, the public schools. So maybe take what you can get, and try to find some, even if marginally, better place to spend it, and to some advantage for your student.As a parent, you can still exert a contrary influence to the poz inculcated in schools, public or otherwise, through active, attentive engagement with your student’s tuition. You probably should do that, anyway, and not limit yourself to just that one area of the poz, ’cause it comes at them from all angles nowadays.

                    N.B.: My 4:22 comment was meant for c matt…3g4me,Don’t know what to tell you. Maybe read my comment to c matt for starters.I still think that this SC decision has some possible utility, but if you are going to automatically throw up your hands and not even consider that the fight over “appropriate standards” must also then be joined so that these “standards” should be limited to objective, pragmatic matters, such as does a student progress in knowledge of whatever subject matter to some level of attainment, and “standards” not be construed to brainwashing toward acceptance of a ideologically-driven political point of view, I think that this misses an opening. Nobody said it would be easy to go up against The Borg, and its ambition that every child should be “assimilated”. The possibility exists that, besides “Borg-lite” non-public schools, other options could also be summoned into existence through communal effort. Otherwise, one is left with home schooling, which I recall you yourself chose in your own situation with some success. Yet, not everyone can exercise that option, though, such as single parents, for whom this is likely impossible given the pressing exigencies of their family lives.

                I haven’t read the decision, so I should probably stop now. But does this mean that the money follows the child? There are rural places where a town has too few residents to justify building schools, so they send the kids to the nearest school, and if it’s a private school the town strikes a deal with them. That’s not exactly choice, but it’s been happening in New England since forever.https://tinyurl.com/3hxdfnsz

            “There’s no way to break this monopoly, just like with the automakers, except with the favored EVs of course”Interesting that you mentioned auto makers. We used to let car manufacturers go bankrupt. Seen a new Stutz, Duesenberg, Auburn, or Cord dealership lately? The Great Depression killed off a lot of excess capacity. Some “Independents” (aka not GM, Ford, or Chrysler) survived with defense contract money in WW2 only to fold post war. Interestingly enough the last true bankruptcy was Studebaker-Packard in the mid/late 1960s. American Motors lashed together the rest of the independents and hobbled along until the late 1980s.If the market worked, Chrysler wouldn’t have made it to 1980, much less 2009. In 1979 the heavy hand of Uncle Sam grabbed the invisible hand of the market and took it off Chrysler’s throat. After much lobbying of him Uncle Sammy guaranteed the bank loans Chrysler got (We The People got the privilege of being the Guarantor of Last Resort for Mother Mopar) which kept them alive long enough to make money and pay the loans back.In 2009 when both GM and Chrysler should have died, they skipped the pretext of guaranteed bank loans and just gave each our tax money.So now the circle is unbroken in that Chrysler, who bought AMC from Renault in the 1980s to get Jeep and killed the rest of AMC has been bought by Stellantis (A world-wide AMC on steroids) who will probably kill the Chrysler and Dodge nameplates and keep Ram trucks and . . . Jeep.Sans government money infusions Chrysler is long gone and GM is bought by, hey, why not Toyota? Note too the government’s heavy hand is forcing the EV solution on us consumers. How many cars does Tesla sell if you don’t get an EV credit from big hearted Uncle Sammy?

        Entertainment? Teenagers go to movies to grope one another in the dark. Adults don’t go to movies. They watch the ball games because the vicarious violence is the most action they’re going to get in milquetoast world. A drunk NFL hoodlum in a traffic accident gets more attention than the star of any new movie. It’s also a reality that the average Yankee doesn’t have the patience to sit through an hour and a half movie without checking their smart phone for messages a dozen times. There just isn’t enough sensory stimulus. That’s what computer generated stuff is all about. It’s all been seen now, nobody cares. And nobody reads. The US vocabulary is limited by smart phone messaging. Soon the Yankees will have the verbal talents of baboons.The real issue of the “marketplace” is that the American love affair with technology doesn’t involve any critical thinking. If it’s new and neat it must be good. The changes that come along with it aren’t considered.

            Spot on! Beware the degeneracy and idiocy of the elite’s children who are going to the top colleges. I see it first hand. Infants with zero ability to think. They also have an arrogance that they know technology. Yet, they don’t know that it is the mathematics of 100+ years ago and the CS of the 40s – 70s and the people who implemented it that are the technologists.What a spot on post. The consolation is the rude awakenings that await these fools who donated their stimulus checks to BLM, “invest” in Gamestop, sport their BLM bumper stickers.Unfortunately, the things that are leading to the rude awakenings are things we have to live and through with as well.

                this is a little bit off topic but is there a precedent for a society collapsing without high rates of violence. Let’s not forget that violence is still at historically low levels. What you see now is a population drugged and addicted to video games porn and high fructose corn syrup. I’m not sure if there is a precedent for this and how a collapse would happen.

        Nonsense.Of course the marketplace exists. And it is working as it always has. Here is YOUR red pill: you aren’t the intended market for Star Wars. Or for most of Hollywood’s “product”.There’s a couple market forces at work here, and unless you understand them, you can’t understand the marketplace.  First: the freak/pervert demographic outnumbers the intelligent dissident demographic by at least 3:1.Star Wars is aimed at a multiethnic young audience that has been indoctrinated and steeped in faggotry, Marxism and chitlib virtues from a very young age. The first trannies will start showing up in the next exciting episode. The kids will eat it up.The second thing is that people are starving for something to watch. So much so, that some folks will go watch the Disney pedos out of sheer desperation. They will hold their noses through the icky pervert parts and mentally edit it out of the viewing experience.Finally, markets can be manipulated. I’ve done it locally as a way of locking out my competitors and getting my products hard sprec’d right at the proposal stage. It’s bloody awesome and profitable when you can do that.I personally would pay through the nose to see a dissident version of Star Wars. But … would you? After a hard day at work would you shell out over $100.00 to take the whole fambily to it? Knowing that the kids would probably hate it?The Critical Drinker paid to get bombarded by absurd virtue signaling in the theatre. No body forced him, he went of his own volition. Is that not how marketplaces are supposed to work?

            Never underestimate how deeply, and how many, truly believe “the message.”.
“In many ways, nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth.  Anyone can believe in the truth.  To believe nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty.  It serves as a political uniform.
And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”  C. Yarvin.

                Moldbug’s  idea is close, but you don’t have believe ‘whatever’ to wear a uniform, all that is necessary is to want to belong to the club. Those folks don’t hold up well when their army starts getting shot at: far fewer true believers than there are camp followers.

            The Critical Drinker has the outrage niche down, where there are a huge contingent of people who grew up loving many franchises who can’t quite let go and want to hear rants about what garbage they have become.  It also helps he’s a very funny guy.Overall he does a service, as he gives a good summary of the latest content in a way where viewers can get the gist without spending their money on it.  It also helps make watching modern trite woke trash very uncoolOverall, he probably ensures thousands of people who would have watched something not spend their money, which is a win in my book.

                Absolutely! He’s awesome. Excellent point.
Where our esteemed blog host goes off the rails is when he says ‘the marketplace doesn’t exist…’
At any given time, several marketplaces may exist and even occupy the same space, as in the case of the Critical Thinker. Players can compete in one or several at any one time.

                Agreed.  I’m sure the Drinker isn’t actually “baffled” as to why Disney keeps pumping out Woke bullshit.  He knows but can’t  really explain the full story without losing his Youtube gig.
He’s about as based as you can get while still staying monetized.

            The Critical Drinker, Dave Cullen and others are looking pathetic like the jock sniffers are. They can’t give up their childhood addictions to older cape and fantasy movies.Cullen will still watch the newest Star Trek woke vomit and complain about the wokeness decline. If they give the white guy a bit of heroism he about wets himself in the hope that goodness is returning. It’s all too much with that generation. Even if you don’t see their faces, you’ll know them by their old timey game or Star Wars t-shirts.

                    I watched “To kill a mockingbird” some years ago to find out what the fiss was about.
I was bored to pieces but I recommend everybody to watch it. It clearly shows the progressive unconscious.
The black people as good children with a heart of gold that need protection from the deplorable hillbillies without teeth. The progressive like the smug white knights providing this protection with moral superiority
When the lawyer gets out of the courtroom and the black people stand up and aplaud, this is the progressive wet dream

            You touch on the ultimate problem with modern marketplace dynamics: it’s the sellers who are tightly controlled, not the buyers. From economies of scale to lockstep media Narratives, it all tries to reduce the consumer into one-size-fits-all. How do you buy a physical book if not from Amazon or a couple other outlets? How do you buy food if not from a supermarket chain? How do you fuel your car if not from a very small number of oil companies?It’s still possible, of course, but much harder than one would expect until he actually tries. I know just from being tall, that nothing mass-produced is ever going to fit my legs. It’s all one-size-fits-Chinese.As Henry Ford infamously put it, the buyer can choose whatever he wants so long as it’s what’s being sold. We’re at peak Industrial Revolution in which the factories dictate market conditions. Perhaps the next step is the Redundant Revolution in which every man has his own factory in his pocket.

        Very good essay. Morality and the supposed feedback loop of the marketplace make me consider last night.Yesterday evening, I attended a forum here in Lagos that was held by a new media outlet, centered around a new poll that was taken in the city. Overwhelmingly, and not surprisingly, the populace wanted lower crime, more punishment for violent offenders, etc. This was given to a cross-section of the city that mirrored the population (68% black, etc.) The audience, and the reporters on stage, however, were overwhelmingly white, bespectacled millennials and women of a certain age (librarian-ish), and a very few bookish minorities. Most everyone worked for a nonprofit or NGO.As the poll was being dissected, I would hear around me the murmur of attendees and clucking of teeth. “This is just not right… The mayor is SO underappreciated… We just need MORE money… Failing schools are a Fox News gimmick…Etc” in other words, the people in charge of the poll and its analysis were staining to find ways to contort it to their closed-in anti-white morality… The feedback loop was simply seen through a different lens.Now then, this supposedly new paper recently teamed with the local NPR station, so we see where the cards lay. Still, however, I’m struck by this poll which shows what people want, but then its bald-faced reinterpretation along certain moral guidelines. If this is a “marketplace of ideas,” then I’m without hope.

        Interesting topic Z.Just a few comments with respect to “go woke, go broke” and the Star Wars franchise in particular.You correctly pointed out that Disney has banked several Billion dollars off of their 4 Billion and something investment with Lucas.Thing is, with the built in fan base, that property should have made them tens of Billions to date.It would be like buying a 40 acre tract of land and only raising a plot of food the size of a garage. You still have food to eat!Also, you correctly pointed out that the entire franchise is/was a vehicle for toy sales.That’s true. But when millions of Rose Tiko action figures are in the dollar bin, you know you done effed up.That said, I understand that the point of the entertainment example was to explain the futility of voting. It’s funny, but deep down, I still a teeny weenie sliver of hope that electing “the right politicians” will turn things around.I’m hoping a course of antibiotics can cure me of such ills.

        Yes, as inflation roars and the economy declines, people will get anxious and worried about the future, and this leads to a general sense of hopelessness and despair. That Hollywood is a cesspool of degeneracy and toxic propaganda is old news. And expecting normie to wise up to the Uniparty grift is a pipe dream. Bad, bad, bad; everything is bad these days and getting worse.But the pressure cooker will eventually blow its lid and people will strike out at whatever is conveniently close by and vulnerable. This is why you don’t want to be in a big city when it happens. The Cloud People are pushing this outcome (like they did in Ukraine) because it’s highly effective at killing off competent white guys, and especially the alpha cohort. Will the masses play along this time? Some will, hopefully most will wake up and refocus on the root problem. Yes, going after the big game  is harder than bullying your asshole neighbor, but that’s what it’s gonna take to in the end, so why not start there? Far less harm and destructiveness, and a much faster rebound to sanity and rebirth. Just sayin’.

        Zman this is an excellent article, but like The Critical Drinker you also have this blind spot. You both fail to see that Liberalism is the problem. The philosophy that rules our life’s and that is in power throughout the West. The protector and promoter of the marketplace. that you quite rightly attack. Yet you can never seem to name it as the enemy. The enemy that you write about is always faceless and nameless. It seems that there are things that you learnt in the 1980’s that you have not unlearnt. You accept that Conservatives are useless, you accept that individuals have failed but you cannot bring yourself to attack the philosophy behind both. It is immensely frustrating to see you so close to the beast and yet never calling it by it’s name.For the record I am a Traditionalist, like Patrick Deneen, not a White Nationalist as you have implied in the past when I have commented.

        The Motion Picture Production Code, 1934-68, enforced by a pledge Catholics used to take on Sunday, kept Hollywood mostly in line. As always, the censorship also forced the artists to be creative. After Vatican II, it was ditched and smut took over.From Wikipedia:Thomas Doherty, Professor of American studies at Brandeis University, has defined the code as “no mere list of Thou-Shalt-Nots, but a homily that sought to yoke Catholic doctrine to Hollywood formula. The guilty are punished, the virtuous rewarded, the authority of church and state is legitimate, and the bonds of matrimony are sacred.” What resulted has been described as “a Jewish owned business selling Catholic theology to Protestant America.”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code

            One immediate effect of the scrapping of the “code” was the blurring between bad guy and good, the removal of consequences of evil behavior and the rise of the “anti-hero”.I submit that the entertainment industry—especially motion pictures—has long been the primary degenerate influence in America.  Our institutions of “lower” learning (college/university) at that time still only reached 20-25% of the youth cohort, whereas everyone went to the movies on a regular basis.  Within two generations we had confused our major cohort of future citizens as to their expected behavior in society.It’s no surprise to me that the professor you quote is from that Jewish institution, Brandeis!  The trend of thought represented is so typical of Jewish intellectuals of the time—even though such degeneracy is decried by religious Jews as well.

            Just compare Cape Fear from 1962, when the code still was on, to its remake in 1991.Good and evil were well defined in the earlier version. Instead in the remake the antagonist DeNiro, the psychopath ex-convict is lionized while Nick Nolte, the husband protecting his family, is a pathetic figure that gets no respect from his wife and daughter.Although the poz really started much earlier, dating back fromRebel without a causeat least.

            He’s on Gab (I think).  If it’s the same writer, now he’s mostly just enraged about right wing political stuff.  Nowhere near as funny or original as his women insights.
Fascination with chasing women ebbs with age and experience.  The guys still chasing the v to distraction past a certain age are pretty sad.

                I think Heartiste’s current insights are about as good as there is.  Since there’s plenty of crossover in women’s nature and political issues, he comes up with some very good analysis.
I learned a lot about women from his blog, and I don’t know if there’s much more for him to share, so moving on to the current issues is logical and useful.

        The current United States is not unlike the former Soviet Union. There is no real marketplace, and like the Soviets, our conditions will continue until one day we wake up and it all completely falls apart. The warning signs are blasting like a firehouse siren, but still most don’t heed the warnings.Most people will be in shock when this occurs, but people such as myself will just go Meh! People still get mad at me when I point out the problems that cannot go on, so I suppose real life experience will have to teach them this.Supposedly a massive shortage in motor oil for diesel engines is about to blindside us by September. They’re saying there will be no diesel motor oil for at least a year. If this is true our collapse countdown will be measured in weeks and days. The ones who can’t adapt to this eventual reality will be the ones who will perish in a post collapse America. And I fear there will be many.

            Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) is an additive required for all diesel engines after 2010. Flying J truck stops are the largest truck refueler chain in the nation; they are being cut back to less than 50 percent of normal delivery.DEF shortages are already here: local truckers having difficulties getting it.

                The DEF news has better sourcing than the diesel oil news for now, but the supply chains are so effed up it won’t surprise me if the oil rumors prove out.
The one good thing about DEF is that it is possible to bypass or delete the DEF sensor and cripple code in the ECU.
On the other hand, I’m sure there are plenty of road pirates out there just waiting to bust truckers for hacking their DEF system.

            Omg.  There used to be “oil” and “coolant” and now the newest, hottest, hippest upgrade means there are a dizzying variety of subgrades of oil and coolant, and you betta pick the right one.
Is this the new new motor oil for the gov- pushed new new motors?  As if 10-30 is too goshdam hard to make?  “But the climate demands it!”
These tiny, critical bottlenecks keep popping up.  For the want of a nail, etc.

                Supposedly there’s only 2 companies that make the additives that go into diesel engine oil, and both are having major problems right now. Supposedly they’re so severe that they’re saying there will be no such oil until well into 2023.I do believe that is called a monopoly, and all monopolies eventually fall apart. Perhaps that is a good text book example of the failure of monopolies as all such concerns eventually fail due to lack of competition.

        BTW, anyone that thinks Disney ruined the Star Wars franchise, or that the 2nd group of sequels did; should go back and rewatch the original series, especially ESB and ROTJ.
Both those movies sucked. And were pozzed as hell.The original Star Wars was decent, maybe really good for its time. But the appeal was as much the visual special effects, which were completely new at the time, and the simplified story of good vs evil.

            This. The Star Wars franchise is the genius of marketing and product development. It was a feature length ad for toys. You can probably point to it as the turn for the worst in movie making. Because it was so successful, despite the boilerplate plot and wooden dialogue, everyone shifted resources to special effects and marketing. It also introduced the accounting gimmick of the franchise, which allows for the capitalization of development costs.

                Whatever it’s deficits, the original Star Wars trilogy had a lot of charm. Was much of the dialogue hokey? That was part of its charm. Was the acting frequently hammy? Also part of its charm. There was something magical in the franchise at that time quite beyond the innovative special effects and endless product tie-ins.None of that is to deny the overall negative effect Star Wars had on filmmaking in general. Why create anything thought-provoking or edgy (genuinely edgy — not “woke” bullshit) when empty, crowd-pleasing fare is so much more likely to succeed big? Of course, that phenomenon will always be a major detriment of the sainted marketplace.

                    If you look at it as a kid’s movie, it’s perfectly fine.  The problem is the infestation of “Disney Adults” who want to remain in perpetual adolescence.  It’s one of the creepiest modern phenomena, and has the same roots as teachers grooming trans kids and other weirdness.  We’re surrounded by people who hit puberty but never became adults.

                Irony being, that the studio didn’t see the possibility for toys at the time.  Lucas (I believe) slipped the merch clause into the contract without objection.  The rest is history.

                That’s all it was to me, a giant feature for cool toys. I remember as a kid really wanting those toys, the neighbor kid had a bunch and his place was the place to go.I really liked those armored walking camel things that got tied up in a rope in one of the movies. I was doing a job a year or so back and the person I was working for was clearing out a bunch of stuff from their parents estate. Low and behold they had one of the original armored camels out of the box but in good shape. The customer told me to take it if I wanted, so I brought it home and gave it to my boy so he could have something the old man used to dream of having. Within a month or so it was promptly used and abused. I was happy regardless. Just wish I could have let one of those Star Wars fanboys seen the aftermath. Seeing those betaboys in discomfort gives me a guilty pleasure.

                Zman:  I saw the original Star Wars in the theater soon after it opened, because the parents of the charge I was nannying that summer wanted him to see the movie.  I suppose the kid enjoyed it, but I didn’t find it all that entertaining (and I was far less detached from popular culture then, as a college student, than I am now).  I’ve since seen various sequels, on t.v./video, and even tolerated younger son’s fascination with them for a period.  Never got what the hype was all about.

                    I was ten when it hit theaters. The special effects were the coolest thing. I remember little of the story as I have not seen it in thirty years. The one thing that stuck with me from seeing it in the theater was my father snoring. He was not alone. Adults found it boring.

                        I’ll disagree.  The story is the archetype of the hero’s quest.  Absolutely epic for a young boy.
Luke was training to be a spiritual warrior in an obviously righteous battle.  The Force is a mystical power that has observable impact in the world, unlike all contemporary religions.
We are about the same age.  The original Star Wars changed my young life even if I wasn’t an obvious fanboy.

                        I never understood the rage. I was a kid and I collected Star Wars stamps and knew and loved the music but my parents never took me to the movie theater. When I watched it in my 30s, I found it boring. I never understood middle-aged guys raving about it 40 years laterBy contrast, my teacher made us watch Excalibur. There is a lot of things for a teenage to love: the sex, the knights, the Middle Ages…But a mature guy finds a lot too: order vs chaos, paganism vs Christianity, the fate, the decadence, the tight script, the search for the Grail, the medieval way of life. This was a fine movie that a mature guy can love as much as when he was a teenager

                I thought starship troopers was pretty good in its brutalityI think that is the only sci movie I have watched twiceDid anyone ever figure out what was the deal with the mashed potato’s in close encounters?  It had a jewy Dreyfus vibe to it like Jaws did I noticed when I had gotten older, so I figured the mashed potatoes were just some NYU students trying to scam young people into thinking there was some important message in the potato’s.  Pretentious nonsense like the movie rumble fish which was black and white except for the scene of the fish in color.  Give me a break.

                        Yeah something like that but it all went waaaaay over my head.  I don’t know who ever liked that movie but apparently it was a major hit.
But this was the time of Spielberg casting his bagel spell over America.  We haven’t been the same since.  His success was an inflection point in the trajectory the culture would take.

                    If you read Heinlein’s book, the movie translation was poor (IMO).  They turned a philosophical tome into a bug movie.  Indeed, when I first saw it, I thought the movie more of a parody, than a translation of Heinlein’s writing to screen representation.

            I never liked it.   I was carpooling with a guy at the time all he did was draw pictures of tie fighters in the back of his mom’s station wagon, I think I was in 5th grade and he was in 6th.  And he was a midwestern transplant or something because he’d say it real obnoxiously like Tyie FeitersMy favorite movie of that era was The Deep.  Even as a young man I was repulsed by space movies and their lack of nature, and the only Star Wars movie I ever remember having some attraction to was the second one with the scenes of the woods.Btw Tucker said something to the effect “when you vote Republican you vote for the chemical castration of your kids”His staff definitely reads this blog

                I worked in tech for decades.  I can’t count the number of adult men who had Star Wars figurines in their cubes or offices.  Painfully embarassing.
The Force is Star Wars functions as a substitute religion for lots of people.  It’s Buddism for westerners.
I spent 10 years as a young man exploring eastern religions and I believe seeing the original Star Wars at a young age was a strong motivator for that.

                    +1 on seeing IT dudes with Star Wars stuff in their cubes. I remember a guy who had a two or three foot long LEGO Star Destroyer perched atop the cabinets on his cube. You could see that bad boy 100 feet away.A good thing about being a contractor/consultant? You travel light because you’ll be rolling off some day and want a quick getaway.Of course I can’t throw too many stones. I toured a Star Wars exhibit at The Field Museum in the early 2000s with a gal I was dating at the time. While she was looking at the costumes and props I’m looking at the IL&amp;M Millennium Falcon model thinking “Oh look, there’s a model King Tiger hull glued on it, there’s a model Panther tank hull, there’s a model Saturn V engine . . . ” 🤓In my best Homer Simpson voice: NERRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDD!

            george lucas was always more interested in the technology of making movies, than in making good movies.   the major tech innovation in Star Wars was to make the models static (i.e. non-moving) and to move the camera around them (using micro-computer control).  this allowed true 360 degrees of movement in all axis, visually.   before Star Wars, all shot involving moving models had the latter going in a straight line (because they were on a string/wire).  go look at 2001 A Space Odyssey to see what I mean.  the action scenes in the original SW movie don’t seem so special now, but at the time they were thrilling.

                Skywalker Sound was Lucas’ greatest innovation out of the STAR WARS franchise (which sucked even back then). I had a fairly good job offer with Lucasfilms, LTD, in the early Nineties in a niche area to monitor and protect Skywalker Sound’s intellectual property rights, which I turned down because it appeared the primary product was about to be supplanted with radically superior technologies. Lucas did bring in new people to his compound on his family’s ranch in San Luis Obispo and adapted quite well to the changes and remains cutting edge to this day.

                    I’d rate the THX quality standards for audio and visual reproduction in theaters as one of Lucas’ better innovations.
They were worthwhile enough that people eventually adapted them to many other A/V mediums.

            I really enjoyed some of the Expanded Universe stuff, like Timothy Zahn’s “Admiral Thrawn” series. As long as there wasn’t any contradiction or conflict with the OT, Lucas didn’t seem to care what people came up with. I wasn’t expecting Disney to draw off that well, but it was disappointing to see them to render the EU irrelevant altogether.

                I remember liking the Zahn sequel novels in middle school, but I thought theDark Empiresequel comics were better.
They actually ripped off major ideas about the Emperor fromDark Empirefor the last SW film.

        Those who have the power call the shots. This is not news.By “marketplace” you must mean some kind of forum or fairgrounds where willing buyers and sellers, under no compulsion to buy or sell (goods, services, political candidates, policies, ideologies, spiritual beliefs,) negotiate a price at arms length.This marketplace, as you point out, has never existed. This, too, is not news. Most everyone whose eyes are even partially open knows this. So what, actually, is your beef? That corruption has taken over the marketplace. Because why? The people in the market, under all sorts of constraint, with all sorts of needs and desires, choose to play by corruption’s rules because few can do anything else, and, for the most part, who can blame them? It’s the nature of the marketplace, not its existence, that causes you/us this frustration.

            I guess downvotes are because people want the marketplace to be real because it gives an illusion of freedom.
But the marketplace is like democracy, communism, libertarianism, etc. – only in theory does it work as advertised.

        Well, there’s a big, fat black pill to kick off the day – well written and with great perspective, but pretty discouraging.  The more you think we can’t sink any lower, the more you realize, oh hell yeah we can.All the folks still blathering about “my sportsball team will win it all next year” or “we’ll really get’em next election” or “I can hardly wait to see the new 60 year old Tom Cruise super hero action movie”, whatever – and you see it through all age groups.Or, why are all these young people suddenly dying in their sleep or getting blood clots or weird facial paralysis when they never or rarely happened before?  We just can’t figure it out.  Oh well, we’ll just call it SADS etc., and be done with it.  We’re ruled by demonic forces that seemingly control everything including the vaunted marketplace we’re all just along for the ride with no apparent way to get the hell off.

            I often thought Smith was having an insider joke with the invisible hand thing.
He knew full well there was a hidden hand manipulating the markets and his reference appears to be an ambiguous acknowledgement that somehow has become defined to mean that there is none.
” by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention”

I doubt that any reader here wants a Soviet-style controlled economy, but we want to observe the world accurately.
Christians would love to see Christian movies and this would obviously make lots of money.  Why are there almost no such movies?

                There are, but they suffer from the same cringe as the woke movies – too overt.  Also, big distributers won’t touch them.  Better ones like LOTR are not overtly Christian, but utilize Christian and universal themes (self-sacrifice for the greater good, loyalty, a sense that there is a greater purpose).  Even movies that don’t intend too, like High Plains Drifter, end up displaying some of these themes – in particular, the sin-punishment-redemption arc.  But if you do it too in your face, it becomes a bit cringe.

                Can you discuss why the belief that the market is largely controlled by elites is “way over the top?”Z-s stated position is that “the market” is a fantasy, presumably to obfuscate an actual command economy (or something similar).   That’s over the top.  It’s the mirror image of the libertarian nuts that claim the free market is unstoppable and always correct.You’r statement that the market is controlled by elites is accurate imo.  But that still leaves room for individual discretion in participation.   Markets do not spring from the mind of Zeus or whatever.  They are constructed by people – who do so for their own advantage. However the vector of markets is persuasion and individual initiative.  Which my people find preferable to the alternative of command and coercion.So simple minded naïveté is the bath water – buyer beware are words to live by.  But markets – persuasion and individual initiative are the baby.

        Why the meme “Go woke-go broke” is still used is because there are instances where there are clear failures because of a woke agenda.  The latest Lightyear movie is looking to be a flop, and an example in another corporation is the infamous Gillette commercial that did hit their bottom line.  The issue is the corporations are so huge they can easily eat these costs, so it’s like winning a skirmish while tanks roll over another one of your cities.With regards to Star Wars, when one looks at the prequels, they weren’t great, but you could at least see a cohesive universe and worldview within that universe.  It’s no Lord of the Rings or Dune with regards to mythos, but passable enough for what it was originally intended for, old-fashioned kiddie schlock.As a side note, if the rumors are true that Lucas intended Jar-Jar to be the main villain in the prequels and he stuck to his guns, they probably would have been on par with the originals in quality.The new creators in charge of the Star Wars property don’t have the IQ to even grasp the kiddie theology of Star Wars, which is why they are focusing on spectacle and a constant stream of content that is ultimately banal and forgettable.  Their Marvel property s heading the very same direction.

            One of the problems with the celebratory Woke-Broke is that it fails to account for the fact that White America resides in the wake of the broke part. IE The collateral upon which the lies are leveraged in GloboCorp is White male productivity.And given that the cult hates White Men above all else, the casualties of economic wokentropy will be outsized losses for White Men and their families – or worse, future families.Elon may be able to hang onto his White engineers for a while because he has photos of beltway faggots on pedo island, but every other globocorp is already looking for reasons to purge our people and the losses will provide ample cover.I understand the impulse toward the cleansing fire of the broke comet, and won’t argue against its necessity, but in some ways the commies are right in that we are all in this together in that a great many of our boys are cube farmers in these corps – or like me have had to purchase a home and/or start a business in the bubble and the only thing louder than the calls for Woke-Broke is the sound of crickets when our boys ask disquieting questions about how to provide economics for their family formation given that it’s all “fake and gay” and about to collapse any day now.I’ve been through this before. All my layoffs in 08-09 were white men. Then I got my own slip, sold the house at the bottom, buncha other boring stuff that eventually led me here and still those questions have no answers. Maybe this time will be different tho. Nobody talked of starvation last time around, so we have that going for us, which is nice.

            With regards to Star Wars, when one looks at the prequels, they weren’t great, but you could at least see a cohesive universe and worldview within that universe.Yes, it’s amazing how Disney managed to get Star Wars fans to love the prequels.It’s no Lord of the Rings or Dune with regards to mythos, but passable enoughThe very first movie was a minor masterpiece, schlocky dialogue and all: There’s a Peasant Boy setting out on an adventure with his Wise Mentor in order to become a Knight. He joins up with a Rogue, sneaks into a Dark Castle to save the Princess from the Evil Wizard. It’s straight out of The Hero Of A Thousand Faces, a no-frills adaptation of every mythological adventure ever written. You even have the Shakespearean Fool in C3PO.The only flaw is that Darth Vader survives: the story demanded that Han and Chewie nailed Vader with that last cannon bolt.People who think Return of the Jedi is the better movie, deserve to have their eyes gouged out.

            Chet, I was going to write a post like yours but you said it all so well.
“Why the meme ‘Go woke-go broke’ is still used is because there are instances where there are clear failures because of a woke agenda.”
All I can add is that the few instances where “Go woke, go broke” succeeds is analagous to the civilized and intelligent blacks that one occassionally meets:  They are extreme outliers that one can pretend are representative of reality.

                Go woke go broke sometimes works on the smaller guys.  The big boys can take the loss which usually bounces back in a quarter or two.

        I run into film shoots all the time in LA, blocks of trailers, pop up organic restaurant tents, Porto Johns, and bypocs with glasses and nubby blonde hair extensions wearing horn- rimed glasses without any prescription glass in them. I usually roll down my window and ask the the white guy with the radio if it’s a union shoot. Hell yeah! Next question, is the tv show or movie another white hating episode of ( fill in the blank ) they smile , sort of ,and respond, hell yeah! And then claim that  they don’t watch this crap and wink. I haven’t watched tv in over 20 years. Sportsball in 15…

He’s the one on the side of the playground watching the other kids play.”

        “People often say that Christianity has no future because people no longer accept the supernatural, but this November’s election will prove otherwise.”Great line.The irony about the entertainment industry is that it no longer is controlled by monopolies yet the folks who operate, say, Disney realize the sheep will go there to graze on its toxic pasture even still. The rams and ewes with the lambs in tow could go elsewhere more easily than anywhere in the past or simply stay home. Covid had dramatically more effect on the old theatre system more than kiddie porn disguised as children’s programming ever did. Granted, Disney revenues are down 50 percent, which is like complaining the trophy wife has slid from a 10 to an eight.Ditto the Republican Party. It has had more success maintaining its monopoly–blocking third parties, chasing out heretics like Trump–than even its more cynical operatives could have dreamed. There is a greater chance of a violent revolution to topple the government than its voters staying home in sufficient numbers to destroy it, and the odds of the former are minimal or non-existent.The keynote speaker at the 2024 RNC will be a tranny who was wounded in Operation Lithuania Tempest in a Tea Cup (this assumes Russia doesn’t vote with its nukes, which is a dodgy assumption). The Grillers and Normies will stand and cheer as the black faggot with an eye patch and artificial limb condemns them as racists and insufficiently pro-war.The “market” is lucrative voluntary self-flagellation. The devil didn’t have to do a damned thing but sit back and collect his winnings.

            According to the internet, “As of September 2021, the so-called “Big Five” – Disney, Paramount, Sony, Universal, and Warner Bros. – held about 81 percent of the movie market in the U.S. and Canada.” The Pareto principle holds. These studios are probably twenty percent of the studios with access to the broad market.Interestingly, the collapse of the studio system has brought the big players closer as they now share talent. In the old days, actors and directors were tied to a studio. That put the studios into competition for young talent. Today they can share resources so they have an interest in cooperation.

                ” The Pareto principle holds.”
Almost exact numerically. And, yeah, the trusts sharing talent has made for far worse movies than the studio systems.
