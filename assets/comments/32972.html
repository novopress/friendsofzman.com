        Empires export their cults, with some exceptions, but some cults make a lot more sense than others. After the Taliban retook Kabul, a photo was taken of an Afghan whitewashing over a grandiose mural of George Floyd that had been put up in the middle of the city. Now, I can understand a pinch of incense for Caesar, but grovelling to the image of an obscure, violent, thieving junkie from the other side of the world? Aside from the moral obnoxiousness of it, that is just very weird. The GAE is the strangest empire in history, and once it has fallen the survivors will be as confused as they are relieved.

            The primary purpose of the GAE is to spread homoexuality, feminism, and black power ideology across the entire globe. If you look at the actions of the State Department, it’s just obvious. It’s also clear that they are true believers in the mission. I mean, they continuously cited feminism as a reason to stay occupied in Afghanistan, and the libs have not forgiven Brandon for pulling out. However, Afghanistan also showed just how quickly the natural order was restored in the absence of the GAE, a process which began days after the Taliban took over. Those State Department funded feminist schools were shut down, the murals were painted over, opium addicts mulling around Kabul like it was SF were brought into treatment centers, etc.It really shows just how fake and, literally, gay, the whole operation is.

                There’s plenty of grift money via GAE wars, but principally it is as you stated.  Our Mission is to spread homosexuality, feminism, and race-identity worldwide, and the Empire is willing to bomb people until they adopt the New Religion.
After half-a-century of Affirmative Action, the priestesses of the New Religion are everywhere in government, especially at the fed level.  Big Sister.
The Left’s role is to advance the New Religion.   The Right’s role is to pretend the New Religion isn’t happening or, when pressed, to commend it as ‘mostly good’.

                    Yea, I think people overstate the grift when they talk about this stuff. Most people are not this cynical, and those who are can usually make more money working in hedge funds or something. For most people, the grift loses its appeal once you get a certain amount of money. Like, Nuland surely has some fat bank accounts in the Cayman Islands, but it’s impossible to deny she’s a true believer. The Afghanistan war made a lot of people a lot of money, but as I stated, the State Department believed in the mission of turning young Afghan women into revolutionary thots and turning the men into gay drug addicts.All available evidence says that the Republicans believe in this stuff just as much, but they use it to whip up support from the proles with “would you get a load of these crazy libs?!?” type stuff while funding it on the back end. And it makes sense, if you don’t believe in this stuff, the government has no place for you.

        Let me share an experience I had over the weekend –A good friend of mine had a halloween party this weekend.  An old friend who I have not seen in quite some time was there.  He’s a 50 year old, second generation Mexican.  His mom is White.  He was in the Navy for a decade and served in the middle east. He’s also a retard.After way too much alcohol and at the very end of the night, another friend asked me about a mutual friend of ours. That mutual friend is straight, White and male and he got laid off about 5 months ago.  He cannot find another job, so I made the comment that he is screwed because he’s straight and White.  Well, the Mexican took exception and started giving me lip about Trump and White people.  He’s also married to a White woman, BTW…  So because I was a bit saucy, I stupidly chose to engage, so an argument ensued.  Things got especially heated when he brought up immigration.  I asked him to define for me what an American is.  He stuttered and stumbled for a good 2 minutes and he couldn’t do it.  I kept asking him, reminding him that it’s a simple question.  “What does it mean to be an American?”.  So he started to get visibly frustrated and was starting to get pretty fed up with me.  “Don’t put me into these logic traps!”, he shouts.  A very simple question is a logic trap?  I asked it again, and he responds, “I don’t know, truth, justice and the American way!”.  Not really understanding that response I asked yet again, “but what is the American way?”.  That sent him over the edge.  The insults started flying and he was rage filled.  It didn’t stop there though.  At this point, my friends who agree with me were trying to get me to stop, but I refused.  I then asked him, “Can a Haitian be an American?”.  His response was “yes, anyone can be an American”.  You can see where this was going now I’m sure…  So I asked him if he believed that once a Haitian steps on the magic dirt, does he stop beheading people, eating dogs and cats and pull out his pocket constitution to remind him that he’s in ‘Murica now?  His response was to smugly brush it off and say that that isn’t happening and it’s all lies perpetrated by Trump.I then let him off the hook by moving to simple question #2.  “Why is Haiti a shithole?” I asked.  At first, he denied that Haiti is a shithole.  That got a response from others standing by as well as myself as one of the most ridiculous statements ever made.  So he pulled back on that and eventually agreed, “Ok, yes, it is a shithole”.  So I asked him again why that is.  He again got flustered unable to answer the question.  Finally he blurts out, “I don’t know – Trump!”.  Yet another ridiculous answer that a retarded 10 year old wouldn’t even muster.  So yet again, I asked the question and he started calling me all sorts of expletives – “you’re trying to get me into a logic trap!!”.  You can only imagine my disbelief in these responses at this point.  So finally I answered the question for him.  “Because it is filled with Haitians.  If these people are so culturally enriching, why must they come to the “racist” United States to have a better life?  Why can’t they make their own country a better place without those pesky White people?”.  Holy hell, that was it.  A friend had to grab him as he went at me.  He was restrained, I remained calm and he then stormed out and left.  That friendship is long over of course.  There is no co-existing with these people or reasoning with them.  I asked him 2 simple questions and he could not give me a single coherent answer.These are the people who are worshipped in our society today just to let you know how bad it really is.  If you think that someday these people will eventually get it or figure it out, you are living in a fantasy land.  There is no room in a functioning society for these people so they must be removed.  The only way you will see any real change is if our side embraces the same tenacity of the left – “by any means necessary”.  However much you hate these mutant retards, it is not nearly enough.

            Tired:  And as you note – White mother and White wife, so kids theoretically 1/4 mestizo.  Depending on the genetic lottery, they could be as much as 85% White.  But I guarantee you they identify as Mestizo and are as anti-White as any mulatto.  I hope your erstwhile former friend doesn’t have the smarts and the animus to try to get you fired from your job.  Don’t underestimate these people’s hatred.  Better not to argue – just don’t go to parties with old friends from your civnat past.

                It was a rage rooted in fear, the fear that the products of miscegenation all have: fear that they themselves don’t belong. It’s difficult enough when one is the result of the union of two quality peoples, like Hilaire Belloc with his French father and English mother. When the contributing people’s genetic and memetic heritage are unequal, identity issues are far more difficult to resolve.

                    Hilaire Belloc’s thoughts are always worth the read. However, he is clearly writing as an observer of a world that he is both attached to and isolated from, by nature of both birth and religion at the time. He himself appeared to have  no particular problems/fears about being a Catholic Englishman whose French was excellent, but that’s not the normal set of results. The average person is not nearly as gifted to be that sort of philosopher.

                    Spot on.  Husband’s godmother was Mexican mestizo, lovely lady – but both knowledge and experience prevent me making the IKAGO error.  Her 1/4 mestizo grandchildren are all aggressively proud of their mestizo ‘heritage’ and didn’t hesitate to take advantage of gibs for being female and part non-White.  I’ve known numerous others – and every last one is convinced they got all they have due to their own merits.  They cannot be trusted.  Maybe when you get to the sixth generation, but even then – who knows?

Only just the gibs mean ol’ Honkey provides).Don Fritos knows the answer as well as you and I do, but its so terrifying he cannot admit it within his own mind, much less confess his knowledge toyou.

            “There is no co-existing with these people or reasoning with them.”So you tried to have an intellectual, rational discussion with a low IQ emotional?  You expect differently?  Of course not.  The emotionality as others have stated comes immediately from the recognition you are correct and worse—that he, himself, is part of the problem.  He is *not* an American in the sense of blood and soil, and can never be.The stoic philosopher Epictetus expressed an idea way back when that I’ve taken to heart.“It is not the insult, but how you react to it that matters.”But again, that’s a White thang.

            The rapturous applause of the Tories in that conference was the stuff of the blackest of black comedies, that a totally foreign woman who spouts platitudes about Scruton is deemed more worthy of recognition and protection than a farmer with a millennium in the country.
I wonder if the Kemi’s of the world know they are just window dressing for slobbering whites or whether they really think they ascended from their own merits. Either way, if one was an African witnessing this lunacy, wouldn’t you deem these people unworthy of their own homeland?

                Those who grovel before the savage get the boot–or the cannibal’s cauldron–and they richly deserve it. Frankly, it is an embarrassing time–perhaps the only such moment in history–to be white.

My experience with the DIE hire crowd is that the vast majority truly believe they made it on their own merits.
Try to tell them otherwise at your own peril!

                Yes. The real problem is not the Negroes and (((Tribe))) themselves so much as the self-loathing white enablers and enforcers of this madness.
None of this could happen if whites stuck together and if white cops were unwilling to arrest their own kind in exchange for a mercenary paycheck.
You see this with other groups, of course… anywhere there is majority Negro or Muslim or Jewish control they favor their own people over whites and post-Christians.

                    The more the Brits justify their 20th century wars of choice against the Germans, the farther they fall into the non-white black hole of salvation from which there is no return. They probably crossed the event horizon from which not even light can escape back during the Blair administration.

Now we know FDR was not only hiding his cancer from American citizens, but planning all along to go to war, hell DID conduct warfare before ‘Hitler declared war on the United States…’
And this is still mouthed as our ‘good war.’

Exactly, but this madness seems to be on the decline. While the election, to cite one example, is meaningless, less than a decade ago Harris as a perceived black woman would have been looking at a blow out tomorrow and that’s not the case at all. The enablers and enforcers are still looming large but their time seems limited.

                                10 years ago Harris would not have been allowed anywhere near the general election. Much like Draco, the increased failing of the system will result in even worse punishments. This is only the beginning (either the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end).

                                    The ball-less version of Harris was first elected, without fortification as far as we know, in 2008 and then re-elected four years later. Granted, Obama wasn’t as bereft of talent, but I suspect the same would have happened even a decade earlier. It seems to be the beginning of the end. I’m watching the private sector and it seems to be souring at a rapid pace. If that matters or not is another matter.

                                        There is a large difference between Obama and Harris. Obama has eloquence (at least reading off a teleprompter) and some measure of tv personality charisma.

                        I doubt Harris could ever be a “blow out” candidate given her lack of ability to string a coherent sentence together.  She’s no Obama.  However, there are many Black women that are verbally fluent—even if unqualified—that could have made it a “twofer”, 1st Black woman President.  The Left is its own worst enemy.
In post Obama reflection, even he was a fluke.  I’ve not seen the Left grooming any Black replacements, nor even Hispanic.  This makes me think the Rep’s will follow the Tories example with either a Hispanic orPajeet or Asian.  They have them all in the wings.

                            Cory Booker was clearly being positioned as the heir apparent to Obama and he clearly was eager to take it up. The problem is two-fold, one is that dude is zesty as hell, still a problem even amongst Dems, and two is that sometimes it looked like he was doing an Obama bit. A lot of Dem politicians (and some black GOP ones too) took up the Obama manner of speaking and inflections but Booker took it way closer. And I think, after eight years of it, people were ready for something different.

                            Harris is particularly awful, and might even win by a slim margin, but it seems the impulse to vote for a black woman really has waned. I do expect if Harris loses claims will be made Michelle Obama would have knocked it out of the park. I doubt it. It even may have more to do with the woman part, not that the racial aspect is even worse.

                        Former close friend – who was far moreracially aware than I when I met her decades ago – actively campaigned for Obama in 2012.  I cut allrelations with her at that point.  She is of Slavic and Anglo-Saxon descent, blonde haired and blue eyed – as is her sole daughter.  There is nothingrational or logical about these people.  You cannot fix them.  And continuing to associate with them weakens and taints you.  Cut them off.

                            While someone like that needs to be removed from one’s life, curiosity compels me to ask if she bothered to offer an explanation. Given it was a woman I suspect the herd instinct was a major motivation. I have read where some self-proclaimed dissidents have said they voted Obama to “send a message.” Needless to say such types don’t have to be taken seriously and they seem blithely unaware of that.

                                Not that Irecall.  And I don’t think it was due to influence from her husband although that is possible.  She had gradually become more and more liberal over the years (living in the DC area, friends, family, work, etc.) whereas I went the other direction (stay at home mom, living in Texas, etc.).  Kind of sad, but the seeds were already there, and the social/political environment brought them to full flower.

                                    Thanks. The locale makes the herd motivation more plausible, but the main thing is to get away from those places and those like her. I won’t belabor it again but I had a similar experience during Covid. The virus caused tremendous damage but it brought clarity to a number of relationships for many of us.

                            Who has led the charge against white men?  White women, especially of the mid to upper classes.
The socio-political criterium for D.C. the past three decades seems to have been ‘Whatever will vex white men more.  Whatever causes them the most damage, that’s what I am for’.
The more privileged and empowered they become, the more enraged, resentful, and spiteful.  Now they are the government so, that’s a problem.

                    Actually I think they will. Boeing is looking to sell off their space contracting division. This is a hot bad of DEI. The tell-tale sign to look for is if they put back up the corporate firewall between military contracting and commercial aviation. That this new CEO has moved his executive office (but not most of the others) back to Seattle is an encouraging sign. The reason these are key is because it was the government, starting with Obama, that really pushed the DEI thing, with legally the easiest area to push it onto is government contracting. Separating government contracting from commercial aviation or shedding it all together will make it much easier for Boeing to remove DEI from commercial aviation, in terms of legality and government regulation.

                    Having recently spoken with an (White) engineer familiar with DIE and Boeing, The trick for Boeing will be to keep the dreck from their DIE initiatives out of positions of influence (destruction).  DIE has been around since before it was named DIE.  In the beginning, the incompetents were kept away from any meaningful contact with the product/production of the company.  In essence they were given “make work”.  As their number began to grow in the organization the demand for real work assignment became too great to resist—and here we are today.  Confounding factors are also present such as a lowering of standards for graduation in technological fields such that even Whites are no great shakes either.  However, you can still hold Whites to a standard and fire them.

                        I did a significant amount of technology consulting for Boeing for a period of about six years ending approximately in 2016. The biggest problem Boeing faces now, aside from a history of awful executive leadership, is that the company can no longer attract or retain engineering talent, largely due to diversity initiatives.A little known fact is that Boeing’s engineers have a union which has negotiated a pension, separate from and in addition to their 401k plan. For the past twenty years Boeing has been cruising by on the backs of senior engineers who are tied to the company by the golden handcuffs of their pension whilst churning young engineers, many of whom are here on H1B visas and have few other options. Young engineers with talent know enough to avoid Boeing in the first place, and those who join soon become frustrated by the lack of advancement opportunity and leave for greener pastures. Boeing is a hollowed-out shell of what it used to be.

                                A lot of these corporate officers are not attached to any particular company or even industry. They will jump ship when the opportunity presents itself and the long term damage is of little consequence to them.
Even those who do stay are not going to suffer due to the compensation packages.

                                Good question. The answer is: finance types who are only interested in next quarter’s numbers.If you look at the recent history of Boeing, they keep flip-flopping between a finance CEO who does thing like hiring $6/hour programmers from India (no joke) to develop their avionics systems which subsequently flew their aircraft into the ground, and then a technologist, who is supposed to get the company back on track. Unfortunately, getting back on track costs money, which displeases Wall Street. Hence, the technologist CEO gets the axe, and a new finance guy takes the helm.The civilian aerospace industry is tough in the sense that there’s not a lot of technological advancement in the mechanical side (think airframes, wings, and even engines) side of the business, so it falls prey to foreign competition. I had the great pleasure and honor to work with one of the leading experts in the world on real-time airframe stress/strain measurement and analysis. Of course, he left Boeing for greener pastures.

                There’s a repulsive anecdote British conservatives used to enjoy telling to illustrate how divinelyroyalshe was.On her 1952 visit to Kenya the Princess and the Duke slept in a great treehouse hotel (a normal building on stilts, but the story is supposed to make you think of jungle movies) and she woke feeling elated, having enjoyed the best night’s sleep of her life. She stretched andbreathed it all inlike a cartoon princess and exclaimed to the Duke, “I feel like an African queen!”“…But youare.”The next day, news of her father’s death reached Kenya.It’s not true, but it is. It “speaks to her character,” as they say. Nobody more deeply desired and relished the death of England.

        I don’t know what to do on a daily level to help jolt your friends from the spell of blackety-black adulation except to continually share those videos showing stupidity, violence and chimpouts. Always bring up the fact that Whites produced 99+ percent of the world’s great inventions, discoveries and accomplishments. Make sure you tell them about blacks in sub-Saharan Africa who were never able to construct a two-story building or discover the wheel. Uncompromising bluntness is the way.

            People don’t care, and they have answers for those discrepancies anyway, even if they are bad ones, as anyone who read through Guns, Germs, and Steel figured out. Black worship is simply filling a vacuum that was left when people of European descent were taught to hate their own history and their own people. We’re not taught Latin and Greek anymore. We are conditioned to believe classical music and Shakespeare are old and fussy and lame. We are told that the people who explored the world were criminals and savages. We are told that our founders were evil men. We look at pop culture and all the White guys are lame and stupid and can’t dance and the house is run by the wife anyway. Many of our fathers bought into this frame implicitly and were not adequate role models or leaders for the home. So, what is there? Well, the cool blacks and the tribe that have been persecuted by your people for thousands of years. So that is who people look up to.We need to restore pride in our own people and our history. Young White men need to be proud of their ancestors and what they did.

                My leftist sister has read Guns, Germs, &amp; Steel, and she’s flustered and has no explanation when I bluntly tell her that blacks are, by far, the most violent people on the planet and are in every country they’re in, and inform her of the absence of progress in sub-Saharan Africa.  Jared Diamond’s explanations simply don’t hold up to the overwhelming evidence right in front of your eyes of black dysfunction and behavior.

                    Jared Diamond wrote a very interesting book that should be considered largely discredited by now. Of course climate and geography massively influence human biology. But Diamond insists , irrationally, that this influence magically stops at the neck and does not involve the brain. That makes his conjectures discredible

                It was only a partial (defensive) victory, though. Gay was removed from her administrative position and sent back to her originating department at the university, where she is still making more than 1/2million $/year tenured. Given that the (((tribe))) is paying most of the endowment in an effort to control the direction of ‘elite’ eduMAHcation, they are STILL paying her.Moreover, they have cemented Tribe-awareness as an element of young elite leftist culture. I think this is one reason some of the Tribe are backing Pres. Trump. They used to have a firm grip on both parties. The Democrat Party is now a melaninated dumpster fire. They barely have control over it with no real prospect for regaining stable governance (willing compliance in exchange for money). Say what you want about the left (they are enemies in every way) but many of them are not simply whores for money like most Republican operatives are. If The Tribe gives MAGA everything they want (mass deportations by the 10’s millions), I bet they could keep control of the Republican Party for many more decades.

        I believe that mainstream White progressives and mainstream White conservatives (as opposed to genuine dissidents) both wish to see Blacks the same basic way — as Whites with darker skin. Barack Obama is basically a White guy with darker skin. Hell, he is technically half-White. And there is nothing remotely “ghetto” about the manners in which he speaks and presents himself. So he confirms what White progressives generally want to believe about Black people. White conservatives weakly opposed Obama over supposed ideological differences. However, had those same White conservatives ever been given a chance to vote for Colin Powell, they would have salivated as they did so, because Powell is another fella who provides support for the illusion that Blacks are Whites with darker skin. White conservatives tend to love that illusion as much or more than do White progressives.When you really get down to it, Whites of virtually all political stripes prefer to believe that all nonwhites (not just Blacks) are Whites underneath their skin. That doesn’t really sound like the phenomenon known as “White guilt” that I’ve heard so much about; sounds more like White universalism, which is simultaneously egotistical and delusional. But there it is all the same.

            Scratch Deion Sanders and uncover John Lennon, or so the thinking goes.
But is this truly white universalism?Ipso facto, quite possibly. However, because white Leftists and conservatives do not admit of racial essentialism (basically genetic necessity) there can be no universalism. If whiteness is merely a construct, and indeed, if race is a construct, there is simply a substrate of humanity, a natural level, to which all people will rise once white racism is eliminated.
Never mind, of course, that that human baseline squares precisely with Enlightenment Western ideals.

            Steve Sailer talked about that at the time. The expression he used was the whites were hoping that blacks would “be more barack and less black”. It was around this time Steve started developing a dark sense of humor. Unfortunately for him, I think he also was one of the HBD guys consumed by the covid-19 lunacy.

                    Bronze Age Pervert’s current hobbyhorse is that HBD guys and “high IQ” civnats are acting out of not only hatred of white losers—a standard expression of loyalty to the regime—but also a consuming terror/awe at black men’s and white non-nerds’animal power.The schoolboy dweeb’s fear/envy of jocks never ends, and “racists are the real racists” (one might say; BAP doesn’t). What the nerd despises isnature—naturalness, acting without fear of reprimand, without acknowledging the rules.The floundering of the Sailerites during the Trump era (covid, Ukraine, etc.) is thus explained. Trump’s a pretty normal guy who symbolizeseven more normalguys. “TDS” is being a dork.True enough to say. (I mean, I’ve said it.)

        I attribute this to the egalitarian ratchet effect.  Under this formulation, a society’s core values double down and intensify on themselves over time – in the West’s case, it is Christian derived egalitarianism (with a small Jewish central banking elite parasiting off of it).  Here,because the lower performing groups cannot be raised to match the higher performing groups no matter the social and government solutions employed, it is the higher performing who must be brought low to equalize everyone.  A society’s core values intensify until either (1) that society collapses within, (2) the society is conquered from without, or (3) society undergoes a transvaluation of values away from it’s existing values.In this post Zman is hoping that a transvaluation of values occurs.  Maybe it will, but I see the future more akin to Brazil (better case scenario) or South Africa (worse case scenario) where these egalitarian impulses continue to intensify with terrible results…I discuss the egalitarian ratchet effect here:https://neofeudalreview.substack.com/p/the-egalitarian-ratchet-effect-why

            Egalitarianism is a product of the Enlightenment belief that reason and logic are all that are needed to organize society. The religious ecstasy in finding the magic black man is derived from the totem being their proof that the laws and principles that define “who we are” have finally triumphed over the human creature.Christianity makes the argument that “justice is blind”, but maintains the distinctions between various identities otherwise, even some distinctions people have basically lost. It is not the basis of modern egalitarianism and this is overtly true. Christianity is still blamed on the basis of Christianity being warped to suit the gods of the Enlightenment and on the basis of a child of the Enlightenment scapegoating Christianity for the sins of their god.The historical proof is that the modern egalitarian fervor did not exist in over a thousand years of Christianity, but give the Enlightenment a few hundred years to make the West post-Christian, and egalitarianism has become a core religious dogma for the newly minted righteous.The philosophical proof is in the Enlightenment framework for civic nationalism, particularly in the belief that all cultures and religions are effectively equal. Christianity is vehemently opposed to these notions.The logical proof I have given before, which is that the Enlightenment declared that logic comes before identity. This is an equivalent statement to “identity does not matter” which is egalitarianism.

                Catholicism is both hierarchical and patriarchal, both anathema to the post-Enlightenment elite. The logical product of hierarchy and patriarchy is monarchy, which is both. The revolutionists aimed to destroy both the Church and the king who supported it. They have destroyed monarchy (the present monarchs are powerless figureheads) and are working hard to finish off the Church.

        This unsatisfied desire for forgiveness that lies at the heart of this worship of Africans in the Anglosphere is not going away, because there is no mechanism to achieve it.Disagree. It is going away albeit slowly. As a preface, I am not as bullish as you on Trump’s chances. Harris very well could “win” tomorrow or in the days afterward, and maybe actually win outright. No, that’s not the point. The point is Harris, who presents herself as black or blackish, could lose, perhaps significantly, and she doesn’t have a lock.Why is this important since elections no longer matter? It is significant in that whites or mostly whites could elect an exemplar of whiteness over a woman who presents herself as black. Granted, she’s a dullard bordering on retardation and should be laughed off the stage, but her “blackness” is no silver bullet that guarantees a win. Obama may not have been as dumb, but his blackness was the main thing that propelled him to the White House. In the 16 years since, whites have decided they can indeed vote for orange rather than black. This is a sea change. Again, some will regurgitate the Fox line that Harris isn’t really black, but even that is a sea change. David Plouffe and the rest of the Obama gang thought they could recreate 2008 and have not. This is mainly due to a cultural shift, primarily among white men since women run with the herd as long as possible.If Harris wins or “wins,” negrophilia may linger a bit longer, but if Trump pulls it out expect blackness to fade even quicker. Britain embraces the absolute worst cultural vibes of the United States and clings to them a while after they fade here, but over time the same will happen there. Politics tend to be a lagging indicator so this will spread over time to aspects of life that matters.It is a real white pill, honestly. Those are still allowed especially when a shibboleth of dissidence takes a turn for the better.

        Although Z Man already stated it, I feel a need to repeat it for emphasis:
The good whites feel guilt over how savage and stupid blacks are as a group and feel that this guilt must be atoned for by someone suffering. But these good whites do not intend to suffer themselves to assuage their guilt. Instead, they want the bad whites, us, to suffer the punishment of living with the blacks, not them. They intend that the bad whites suffer, not themselves.

        Just to give a bit of context, in the early ’90s a Tory “safe seat” became vacant ( a “safe seat” is one that’s been held by the Tories for decades and that always gives the Tory candidate a large majority of the votes). John Major was PM at the time and he pushed a black candidate onto the constituency. That candidate lost the safe seat. Going back further to around 1967, a parliamentary seat became vacant in the Birmingham area. The Tory slogan for that constituency was, “If you want a nogger for a neighbor, vote Labour.” This new Nigerian the Tories have nominated as party leader makes no sense at any level. It’s beyond lunacy.

        Tossing God out of one’s life leaves a big hole in the center.  Identity politics (feminism and race-grievance, mostly) is the religion that humans create to fill that hole.  Politics is of central concern to leftists — and they pour their lives and passions into it — because it is their sole contact with divinity.  It’s fake divinity yes, but when enough comrades shout loud enough, the ecstatic mob frenzy overrides the falseness of it all.Ultimately Progressiveness disappoints and frustrates because, in short, human beings are not God.  It’s religion-lite and just doesn’t taste the same as the real thing.  The disappointment leads to further scapegoating because the only other option is to blame themselves. . . which cannot be done because, after all, they are the new God.The Divided Society is advantageous for economic elites, which is why they bankrolled and backed it the past seventy years.  Turning men into second-class citizens in the West has been especially effective in furthering the designs of the bankster and old-money class.

        This is why the war in Ukraine is so important. The Russian army is brutal reality and no amount of fancy narrative will change that. And these troops have resigned themselves to the task of killing off the insane normies who bear allegiance to Zelensky &amp; Co (really, it’s Blackrock et. al. calling the shots). Sadly, this is the only road to remedy and England will soon learn this lesson as well. It’s going to get ugly, but the Brits love the word “bloody” for a reason.

                The African Catholic bishops are not vocal bloc against Pope Francis. They have politely pointed out that the alphabet people are a minority problem in Africa and they won’t be focused on the letter. Pope Francis agreed.
The refusal to acknowledge the authority of Peter makes one not Catholic, which you are welcome to do. However, it’s mostly based on an Anglosphere media that lies when it’s lips are moving, particularly about the Pope and Catholics.

Christians hoping that African Bishops will come along to save their churches are guilty of that same thing the Tory party is.
They don’t have the balls to fix things themselves, so they make an attempt to outsource their salvation to black pastors who hate gays.

            Egads. Several times in the Midwest area (Iowa and thereabouts), I saw various transport busses filled with well-dressed African immigrants, many of whom bore tribal scars. (They had stopped at truckstops for gas and snacks.)
Those busses were marked Episcopalian Church, as proudly non-racist as Tucker Carlson.

        Why does Christianity always get the blame when people who are not Christian do such idiotic things while their Christian ancestors did no such thing. It is the religious impulse that used to be put into Christianity that is now instead directed into secular causes like negrophilia and homophelia..
What the Tory leadership demonstrates is the conservative parties are incapable of learning any lesson. They are completely useless.

        Say what you will about Barack Obama, at least he is a man (biologically speaking). The Tories seem to have this deep-seated desire to be ruled by a strong woman, as expressed by their continued and baffling love of Thatcher (which is somehow even more cringe than the American cons’ continued love of Reagan). In those terms, it makes total sense that they chose an African mommy to lead them. More and more it is becoming clear that  many Western men simply do not want to lead anymore, and would rather be told what to do by a woman. Yet, notallWestern men – indeed, we are seeing a very big dividing line here in the USA with this election.

            The Tories express Traditional Romanticism, with its roots in cathari France and the old courtly-love rituals that sprang up amongst the nobles.Many U.S. conservative men are likewise, believing themselves paternalistically chivalrous, elevating women as a class as their moral and spiritual ‘betters’. . . the ‘better half’ types.It is cowardly, fake and satanic.  Their desire is strong for Big Mommy to run their lives, so often their wives or daughters take up the slack reins.  They cheer-on ‘conservative’ female candidates, although those candidates invariably are feminist.It is saddening to witness, but very common.  Modern Western men are head-shakingly pathetic.

        I think there’s only one way this ends for the neo-israelites &amp; that’s them being genotypically cleansed. I say that because this genotype of noble savage worshipper seems to exist in all Euro races to varying degrees, we see that here in our ridiculous mix of Euro races living in one place dividing themselves up by ideology.On a side note there’s certainly a racial/ethnic pattern to it though, if you look up “if only White Women voted” infographic for the last few elections it becomes very obvious which Euro races are over represented in savage worship compared to the others. You can also see it with “if only men” &amp; “if only White men” voted but it becomes laser focused when narrowing down to White women voters. The red &amp; blue pattern shows up exactly where you’d expect with the knowledge about Euro political view racial averages.Back on topic, the problem is these Euros &amp; their opportunistic jewish allies have been working very hard to cleanse the Euros who don’t agree with their insane beliefs. If they succeed in their plans they’ll cleanse the entire West of people like us &amp; then they’ll have finally reach the promised utopia of a savage majority shithole. The end game from there is getting eaten alive by the savages which they will view as their final act of martyrdom.There’s no reason to think they want anything else, they see the same things we see &amp; they want more of it, not less. When one of their own gets slaughtered by savages at best they treat it like a freak accident that no one could’ve ever seen coming. The most common response is to empathize with the alleged plight of the savage &amp; call for more restrictions to be lifted &amp; more legalization of anti social behavior.There’s been studies where they scan people’s faces &amp; run the images through a program that predicts with a high degree of accuracy what their political beliefs are &amp; can even detect homosexuality. Seems phrenology as a concept wasn’t false so much as the specific methodology used (save for big  hooked noses, I think they were onto something there) but facial structure is just the phenotypic expression, phenotypes aren’t always representative of the underlying genotype. Going deeper with brain scans to view brain structure they are not surprisingly even more accurate when it comes to predicting political views.It’s widely accepted in the DR that you cannot socialize a bantu into becoming the equivalent of a White person because of the underlying genetics. That same logic applies to leftist Whites, they’ve been molding society into a dysgenic paradise for ages making it more &amp; more degenerative. I know I mentioned this before in a previous comment but I think it bears repeating: these types of people used to be executed. If you ever wonder why subversives like jews used to be routinely expelled but now have been running society for a unprecedented amount of time unopposed that’s the answer. The adoption of liberalism which is itself a product of ease of living &amp; keeping every dysgenic freak alive, because at some point it was decided everyone regardless of quality must be artificially kept alive, combined with the idea that dealing with degenerates was immoral created the perfect conditions for the worst people to thrive in society.The dysgenic freaks have been allowed to become so populous that they, along with the predatory sociopaths who worm their way into positions of power, dominate the culture. The West has quite literally been practicing eugenics in favor of savages &amp; freaks selecting for dysgenic people via welfare policies which naturally favor the most impulsive, anti social &amp; low IQ people. That’s also why they support importing foreigners who are loyal to the subversives &amp; not the nation itself. Now our society lionizes them, being a fuck up who’s willing to put their life on broadcast gets you rich, being a whore is extremely financially rewarding, psychopathic personality traits are extremely adaptive in our society, everything thats healthy is inverted now.Naturally this won’t last, practicing bioleninism is akin to locusts eating every last plant in a region &amp; then dying off en mass. The only question is whether they’ll successfully run down the demographic clock on their enemies, us, before natural selection returns. I’m sure some sane Whites will survive but how many &amp; whether they will they have the will to assert themselves to carve out their own territory remains a mystery.I think Europe is better off at least, when islam inevitably faces off against leftism it will win easily &amp; with that liberalism &amp; by extension feminism will die. Spain &amp; Italy survived hundreds of years of islamic rule &amp; they went on to retake their countries whereas hundreds of years of liberalism brought the West to its knees, replaced the much of population with savages &amp; utterly decimated birthrates. A European civilization can survive foreign islamic rule but there’s not a lick of evidence that it can survive liberalism longterm.It seems ironic on its face that foreign rule by primitive goatfuckers is less of an existential threat than our dysgenic kin &amp; their maladaptive ideas but the former is far more in tune with reality than the latter. The lesson here is that the most important thing is acknowledging reality &amp; having the conviction to deal with it by any means necessary. If that means burning witches at the stake &amp; impaling invaders on the battlefield then so be it, we don’t exist outside of nature &amp; pretending otherwise has been an utter disaster.

        Hughie Charles and Ross Parker wrote two patriotic songs during WWII, both sung by Vera Miles. “There’ll Always be an England” and “We’ll Meet Again.” You can listen to them at You Tube. You may remember “We’ll Meet Again” as the closing song from “Dr Strangelove” as atomic mushroom clouds blossom in the atmosphere. Somehow both of these songs are connected in my mind in a way that their creators could never have imagined. I don’t have to tell this audience that DIE and incompetence are intimately connected so that’s how I see the present situation.Starting about twelve years ago I began to see the catastrophe unfolding and it has now reached its bitter denouement. Good luck to everyone after tomorrow.

        To add to my earlier post, I think the desire for advancement and ambition by shut-out White men are going to be decisive in creating a new morality. The current one appeals deeply to AWFLs, and black foreign Elites. Not many else. Yes, the sort of they/them will scream and shout and be angry at a drop of a hat. But what else.I suppose there could be an appeal to pure sadism among those that bio-Leninism recruits. But that always results in a Man of Steel (the original one) running the country with ever greater brutality until even his closest circle has had enough.The new morality is most likely to be ancestor based, rewarding White male ambition, and very non-Christian. The value for a White man will be demonstrated ability and performance, in emulation of past heroes now despised, not abasing themselves in front of say President of Earth Stacey Abrams.**Star Trek recently had her as the President of Earth in one of their abysmal shows.

        The Puritans eventually came to grief after Cromwell died. His son and other would be successors could not keep together the New Model Army.The Puritans won because of their internal superior cohesion, building upon the resentments the Danelaw inhabitants had since the purges of the 1100s. They were not really “English” as much as English-ified Norsemen. Compared to the shambolic, divided Cavaliers backing the inept King, they had greater unity. They produced a superior military force which was decisive as being the newer force, they had no long traditions to abandon and overthrow to find actual battlefield effectiveness.BUT, they could not rule. They had no way to absorb their enemies into the elite and thus had eternal enemies who had ability and former status always anxious to overthrow them. Their military reforms were copied by their enemies. They lacked after Cromwell, charisma and the ability to inspire men on the battlefield. They had no solid backing outside the Danelaw aka East Anglia.Harris like Biden inspires no one. The emphasis on the many being sinful by their very nature appeals to the Elites who are Elect, but does not allow for the ambition of any of the sinful nor any future but moving from peasants to slaves. At the same time battlefield effectiveness in mass is about zero. The Elect have never been more united, and they have never offered so little in power and patronage.The old medieval systems where nobles and powerful merchants built cathedrals to honor the Church (and employ lots and lots of skilled craftsmen) was very stable. It took revolutionary technologies of the printing press and firearms to overthrow it.My question is: to whom do the Elites offer patronage and advancement? A few foreign born or origin non White elites (Harris’s father was a big shot Marxist Professor out of Jamaica’s ruling families, Obama came from elite White and Kenyan families and his stepfather was #3 for Suharto for years). If you want to know why Trump, RFK Jr, Tulsi Gabbard, Elon Musk, JD Vance, and many others are not Democrats, it is because they are not part of the Elect and by inheritance and their nature they cannot be.The true enemy of the elites is non-Elect ambition.

        The “based” black/non-white option is likely to end up worse for the UK in the long run than a mulatto progressive like Obama would have been. The former drops the guard of the English people and whatever segment of their upper class that still wants to resist multicultural Britain, since by having the first black leader of a party be conservative, they’re like to think that ackshully multiculturalism is totally possible so long as the non-white in question “assimilates to our values”.

        A favorite cult classic of mine. 2011 Obama was to show up at the Portland Museum of Art for a fundraising dinner, advertised as “Dinner with Obama”. The upscale cult members when into paroxysms of ecstasy at the chance to have dinner with Dear Precious.
In the event, he showed up, said “Hi ya’ll. Thanks for the dough, [suckahs!]” and promptly left.   They all glowed the momentary bliss of having been in the same room with divinity.
We rubes laughed. Dinner with Obama***

                Lately, he’s been putting little baby’s feet in his mouth. The psychopathology of the white women who offer their baby up to this monster just boggles the mind. I understand now why Puritans felt the need to plant some of their women in bonfires. They knew their women better than us: mutilating the Chinese proverb, burn a witch to scare the monkeys.I suspect our spiteful mutant problem has deep roots, and wonder how much of it might be due to intra-racial inter-ethnic miscegenation. The ethny’s of the European race are individually far more diverse than the ethny’s of the other races. We know that sometimes immune system genomic architecture doesn’t always meld quite right; it may be that the at-least-as-complex architecture for sapient cognition can show a similar shortcoming.

        Here’s a pro tip: any political leader whose background is absolutely inscrutable is an intelligence asset. Badenoch (Boris? for those of us old enough to remember Rocky and Bullwinkle) is an MI6 asset and probably tied to Mossad. Obama was a covert CIA asset, as opposed to the Bushes, who were overt CIA assets. Vance is likely tied to Mossad through Peter Thiel, who made him rich and famous enough to gain a seat as Senator in Ohio. Kamala Harris is a CIA asset, likely tied to Mossad through her husband.At least Badenoch’s claim of working at McDonalds seems to be credible. She’s got that one up on both of our candidates.

        I went to see Obama on the 2008 campaign trail, and he was super underwhelming. Droning into his teleprompter. Even the Blacks there looked bored.

            A traditional adult male voice is rare enough now that its tone alone can carry a world-altering psyop. “Articulate” Obama is more poorly evidenced than Bigfoot. Unlike Bush, he had actual dumb-guy verbal gaffes that showed he doesn’t know normal high school vocabulary words. But he does talk like a man. The content of his speech is the sound of it.

                Identity Dixie’s website has an interesting post about “here are the six options for the election outcome”. (Tom Shackleford, I think, is author)
it is very interesting, esp because the writer is genuinely luke-warm on both Cameltoe AND Orange Man.
I think he boils it down well, and offers realistic, and thus compelling, options. (No “polls” involved.)

            Prediction #1 is that we’ll probably have at least a week to make predictions before the outcome is knownRs see the heavy R turnout relative to early voting of the past, and want to believe that’s a good sign. Ds see the heavy female turnout and want to believe that’s a good sign. I’m inclined to see it the Ds way, because I know women. For the Ds and the Iowa poll to be right, a lot of those women registered as Rs would have to be voting their uteruses, and there’s this huge groundswell of feminine support going to the polls to protect their right to kill their babies. It’s possible, plausible. Likely even. The comedy is that the dumb cunts are too ignorant to realize that no such right would be restored at the federal level during the reign of the 90IQ hooker. Anyhow, the msm has the narrative all ready to go for that eventuality. Complete with the “keep it secret from your husband” ads foretelling the outcome. The ultimate victory of feminism, destroying western civ for the freedom to be sluts, that they aren’t even going to get. Of course I would prefer to be wrong.

                I would prefer you were wrong also, but you aren’t.  What is the Left but empowered females (feminists) tearing the nations to shreds as intel and government incite them with even more you’re-a-victim propaganda?  The Great Fear of the modern female is that she won’t be allowed to slaughter babies — this is what most motivates her.
It is the Kronos Cult, gone multi-national.  A Moloch Center in every neighborhood.  A death cult masquerading as political advocacy.
Females get to wield power in all institutions, while complaining they are oppressed and victimized.  Hard to turn down a deal like that.

                Yesterday the Daily Mail featured photos of some dumb c*nt in Iran who – to protest wearing the Hijab – stripped to her underwear in public.  All the comments I skimmed were variants of “You go girl!” and “So Brave.”  Women validate their existence by refusing to procreate and killing the child if they happen to get careless, and parading their bodies while screeching “Don’t touch,  and respect me always!”  Yet again – as a woman, I despise most women, and I make NO apologies for this.

Not femininity (I like pretty things and love babies and cook etc.), but the vacuous, irrational approach to life.  Not to mention the lying and the incessant game playing and endless neediness while proclaiming how ‘strong’ they are.  Just not how I choose to behave or live.

                            There’s certainly some truth to that.  A lot of it is competition.l  There’s an old joke about the female element in the periodic table.  I don’t remember the whole thing, but one of the chemical properties was “turns green when in the presence of a finer specimen”.
My wife can’t stand most women.  She tried a long time ago to go to parties and hang out with women she knew.  She would always come home exhausted and exasperated.  I’m fortunate to be married to someone who understands and applies logic to most situations.

            I think Trump is going to win because he has the proverbial wind at his back. Unfortunately, due to demographics and the immorality of this country (think of the women voting solely to preserve the right to infanticide), it will be close and it shouldn’t be close at all.I think Josh Shapiro and Gretchen Whitmer want a shot in 2028, something they wouldn’t get if the 90-IQ Kamoron and her running mate, Minnesota Fats the Kid Toucher, are running for reelection.All they have to do is not call off the shenanigans machinery entirely, but not go all-in on it. When we’re talking about a 100k vote margin, that is likely enough.But even if Trump is elected, demographics aren’t going away. And the people in charge are funding more shenanigans, like suing states because they don’t have enough malleable black idiots in Congress who are the most reliable votes for the regime.We’re going to get a nice, 4-year respite from the regime’s machinations, but after that, it’s anyone’s guess.

                This is a realignment election.  Don’t be surprised if white women are the outlier while men and minorities move strongly to Trump.  I don’t know if that’ll be good for the country or not.  But if it leads to deportations and blacks starting to realize they need to get their shit together, it’ll be worth it.

            As Z pointed out, all the indicators are pointing in the direction of a Trump victory, and a pretty easy one too (along the lines of Obama’s 2012 win). The real question is how much fortification there will be and that is simply impossible to predict. If Harris wins both Georgia and Pennsylvania, then we know there is a lot of fortification.

                Fortifications are built on a foundation.  In elections today, the foundation is legitimate voters.  The fraud gets built on top of that.In swing states, early voting by Dems is way, way, down from 2020.  While I think it’s plausible that Dems will print up as many ballots as they can, the early voting indicates they haven’t been able to build up the necessary foundation.  Stuffing the ballot box is hard to do, and early court rulings last week suggest the courts at the appellate and higher levels have figured some of this stuff out from 2020.Not everyone, even on the D side, is ready to drive the status quo national consensus in the toilet.  I think they will take a strategic defeat to try and preserve fraud for better candidates.  If I’m wrong, well good, we can at least get on with totalitarianism and half the country can just abandon the system.If they let Trump win, it continues the illusion, and the illusion is MUCH more profitable.

        There is no escaping reality, no conquering or overcoming reality. Reality is the ultimate champion, flawless, indestructable, undefeatable.
Accept reality, that is the only answer.
Jordan Peterson said it best, when he channeled Christ’s message: “Take up your suffering”
For it is only suffering and its alternate forms of poverty, illness, darkness, and chaos, that exist in reality.
There is no escape from suffering. Only hope one may find is in the afterlife. But on this planet, suffering is king.
Stop looking for salvation yourself, Z. There is none for you, there is only suffering and poverty.

                Oh,and mommy came to the UK to have her before birthright citizenship was abolished, then went back to Africa. One wonders why they don’t stay and improve the lives of their own people.

            “Has “The Z Man” had such outstanding and varied successes?”
Silly put down. IQ has little to do with desire for any particular classification of success. Achievement of a particular goal, yes, but selection of that goal? Doubtful. Z-man does quite well in his particularly chosen niche. More power to him.

        Barack Obama should divorce his wife and marry the.leader.of the British conservatives. Then he should take the leadership.of Labour. He and his wife would have a lock on the 2 major parties. The couple couldn’t lose in the elections. All the ads would hail the Chocolate Power Couple, whose political symbol would be a 🍓 strawberry dipped in chocolate
