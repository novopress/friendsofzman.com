        If the giant perp is close enough to touch you, he’s close enough to wrest your service revolver from you — at which point he has the option of shooting you.  That’s the thing to keep in mind in these incidents.  That’s the real reason you have a very, very good chance of being killed if you charge at an officer

        “What we know so far is that the cop was struck in his car hard enough to fracture his eye socket”
No we don’t know that.
We know he is injured, there is no evidence as to when, where or by whom.
If these injuries were contemporaneous with the shooting, the news of them would have been broadcast within the hour.

        British cops do not routinely carry guns, and it harks back to a time when most criminals — once apprehended — would surrender peacefully. I do know of a (retired) Brit cop who would go up to someone suspected of a crime and tell them to report to the local police station. He would then go and complete his beat and leave the suspect to do as he was told. They normally did, because that was the rule of the game. They were probably petty criminals and not only knew they would only get so far before being caught and anyway, violence would get them nowhere good.But things have changed in the UK. There are young blacks who think gangs and guns are good and young Muslims who are itching to get their hands on AK47s in places like Syria and then come home to see what they can do here.The cops here have access to guns: each area has a patrol car permanently out with arms in the trunk and the police are trained to use firearms. How long the old ideal of the unarmed bobby can last we shall see, but it may not be long.

        Yeah, we do know. A man who is surrendering does not advance into gunfire. He stops. He turns and twists as he is hit. Not Mr. Brown. Straight ahead until dead.
What is remarkable to me is how exceptional an individual this cop is.  But I do not understand how it is that law enforcement would have single operator squad cars in the red zone, and why anyone would agree to risk that duty.

        Watching Red Eye, i.e., Greg Gutfeld and His Boring Geeky Friends, is a waste of time.  It’s cheap broadcast programming used to fill the airwaves with white noise.  Maybe if the “guest” list wasn’t so full of insiders, so incestuous, they could invite someone to appear on the show who’s interesting or controversial or insightful enough to make it worth staying up to watch. Otherwise, it’s snooze time, ZZZZZZZZZZZ.
