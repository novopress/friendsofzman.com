        It’s the Dunning-Kruger Effect.  People who are stupid don’t have the sense they need to tell who is and isn’t stupid.  DK had people assess their own intelligence, and then measured it.  What they found was:
The top (7-10/10) think that they are a little under the top. (6-9/10)
The upper half (5-6) think that they are the upper half. (5-6)
The bottom half (3-4) know that they are the bottom half (3-4).
The absolute bottom (1-3) think that they are the top (7-10).
