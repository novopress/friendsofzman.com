        Good to see the Z zooming to the top of the charts. What an enjoyable read this blog is! Also, following the sidebar links has exposed me (and I‚Äôm sure many others) to minds we may not have met, were it not for you.
Yes, the comments can be intimidating ‚Äì there are many intelligent beings here with knowledge and stuff ‚Äì but I still like to throw in something dumb every now and again.
I can‚Äôt even remember how I got here ‚Äì maybe the Woodpile or Am. Digest ‚Äì but darned glad I did. Thanks, Z Man.

        I echo everyone‚Äôs sentiments thus far,this site makes me think,and I always get a chuckle. Found Z Man thru American Digest, thanks Gerard,and Z.     Steve Bannon is Trump‚Äôs most interesting pick yet,as evidenced by Dirty Harry Reid‚Äôs excoriation on the Senate floor. Add the always reliable font of anti-white male bullshittery that is the Southern Poverty Law Center who claim Bannon is a ‚ÄúWhite Supremacist‚Äù . The fact that both Trump and Bannon have nutsacks filled with something other than glitter and fairydust gives me real,genuine hope for our country.

            I‚Äôm here because Z is frequently linked by‚ÄúA Nod to the Gods‚Äù, which I also frequent because the proprietor there and I have similar tastes in both politics and salacious boobie pictures.
I like red-pilled conversation and poontang. So does our President Elect. Turns out I‚Äôm a man ahead of my time.
Keep up the good work, Z.

        Several things say more about your blog than I could:
‚Äì The number of female commenters.‚Äì The number of non-U.S. commenters.‚Äì The lack of blowhards among the commenters.‚Äì The general maturity of the commenters‚Ä¶ flame wars are vanishingly rare and trolls are seldom fed.
Others have already written about the general quality of posts and comments.

        The comment threads are as valuable as the posts.  I don‚Äôt know how vigorously you police the comments, Z, but please protect the provocative semi-civility of the comments, they add great value and also help sort out my own thinking on many topics.

        Agreed. It‚Äôs a great site, with a great community of commenters.

                    I‚Äôve been waiting for him to reappear with his Eurowennie drivel on how backward we Ameicans are, I have prepared an entire (somewhat long) post with a bunch of links that demonstrate how the untrammeled muzloid invasion is tearing his country apart at the seams (along with all of Western Europe).
I think he‚Äôs MIA because his delicate sensibilities needed a ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù to pet his puppies and use his crayons.
Or maybe he‚Äôs just decided to take his soccer ball and go home.

                        Maybe Karl decided to just go drive his German made auto on the road that Hitler legacy left rather than get frustrated trying to educate us dunderheads on advanced economics and industrial processes.  After all, Germany is in the good hands of Frau Merkel.

        I remember when I first came here and I was one of a dozen or so commentators (or common potatoes, as I prefer) but it is heart-warming to see how you have appealed to so many moire, Mr Z.Of course it also helps that you talk sense and put things in a clear and understandable way. It also helps you have actually seen something, and noted what you are seeing, of the world beyond the gated enclosures of the elite. I accept you may have your own gated enclosure, but your mind is open. I am grateful for that.Please continue to do such sterling work on behalf of so many, even people like me who are obliged to live on a damp island somewhere off the coast of the EU.

        Best insight on the net, or on anything else. Some assembly required.
Works a regular job, works a regular job inside enemy lines, travels regularly through Indian territory, lives among various second world and otherworldly humans, is a fly on the wall of Oz. What a diabolical plan. Pay sucks, the wages being satisfaction, but you deep cover agents are hard to find and hard to kill.

        A coworker friend put me onto your blog back around Easter of this year. Been checking it religiously ever since. I read ALL the comments and yes some of the replies are way over my pay grade. : ) As much as I love history sometimes the historical references I‚Äôll still have to research. Which is good‚Ä¶makes me smarter. Perfect timing regarding this question. ‚ÄúWhat do all of you do?‚Äù I‚Äôm a locomotive engineer. I run freight trains for a living. I ask only because of the quality of the replies. They are fantastic. Please forgive me if nobody cares. Just curious is all.

            Hi Meema, I think the Clinton CF will slowly melt away.  As their influence wanes, they no longer have a product to peddle.  The left hates it‚Äôs losers, as does the right, but over time Hillary will be reviled for losing a what they see as pro forma contest to the hater Trump, hence the rending of hair and gnashing of teefs.  I too am an engineer, civil, PE.

            Well said,Meema,I feel the same way.  Speaking of Madame Lafarge,she gave a speech before the Children‚Äôs Defense Fund in NY yesterday. [It‚Äôs always ‚Äúfor the children‚Äù u know]  She looked like she hadn‚Äôt showered,nor slept,since the election-greasy hair,no makeup,balloon bags under her eyes. She looked like Soros in drag,and I‚Äôm not saying that to be bitchy,it‚Äôs the truth. How her handlers let her out like that is puzzling. Seeing her reminded me of the enormity of the bullet this country dodged. I know we‚Äôre in for a hard slog,but at least we have a chance for course correction.

I‚Äôm not a ‚Äútree house‚Äù kind of guy, but I‚Äôm very comfortable in this group. This blog inspired me to start one of my own; time will tell if some of the commenters here will pay me a visit; our host did!Don‚Äôt remember how I came here, but believe it was from a link placed by a commenter on another blog.I‚Äôm likely one of the older folks here (70), but I know I‚Äôm not alone. I‚Äôm also a dual national (US/EU) and a bilingual permanent resident of Argentina, an expat for much of my adult life. This blog, with the RSS thingee on my toolbar, is one I visit daily and the one that gives me the best sense of the state of things out there in the wider world. Keep up the good work, my thanks to our host and you all who take the time to add to the discussion.

        Z, cream rises to the top.  If we had an even semi-respectable press (the best that can be realistically wished for), instead of what we have (a cult of shrieking, emotionally stunted kindervermin as incapable of assessing objective realities as they are devoid of the means of self-reflection) we might have found you in a Restonesque corner office hung with little neglected plaques awarded for being America‚Äôs best columnist.
It was not to be, but a man takes the world as it finds him.

            Thought I‚Äôd pass this along; Steven Den Beste did not altogether retire from blogging, he switched format to a daily life/anime-oriented blog, seldom talking engineering, politics or WOT.That too is now over, he passed away mid-October, date and cause uncertain:http://chizumatic.mee.nu/board_up_the_windows_cause_theys_a_storm_coming

        You‚Äôre probably not getting much traffic from me because I only have 150 friends, but I‚Äôve linked you on Facebook several times since the summer. Most of my friends on there are SJWs or sympathizers, but I‚Äôve noticed a few men who‚Äôve been conspicuously quiet about the election over the past 18 months. The ones I‚Äôm thinking of probably hadn‚Äôt heard of the alt-right until Hillary gave her speech, and I‚Äôm hoping a few of them visited. The brevity and quality of your posts encourages new readers to binge read, or at least they did for me. IMO, if you want to red pill someone quickly, you should send them here and recommend the ‚Äúbadder thoughts‚Äù tag.

        I do have a housekeeping issue with the blog, or with WordPress.I read these things on a laptop.  On my laptop, comments longer than about ten lines get cut off and you have to click ‚Äúread more‚Äù to see the rest of the comment.  This is a minor annoyance, but it means by definition on the better comment threads, with the meatier comments, the reader has to keep clicking ‚Äúread more‚Äù to follow the discussion.  I‚Äôm lazy enough and short enough on time that the effect on me is that I usually don‚Äôt bother reading the comments.I don‚Äôt see this on other blogs and wonder if it is fixable.  I also can‚Äôt figure out a way to earn a living off this, so I do appreciate you writing here in your spare time.

        Found the blog by clicking your name after you commented once on a Sailer post quite a while ago.As I may have mentioned here way back when, a number of your quips were great for posting on FB to rile my numerous leftist friends. But with the election, I actually defriended one of them because of their tiresome political posts, and apparently I wasn‚Äôt the only one, so the person said they‚Äôd tone it down (in a general post visible to a common friend). I refriended the person and overly said (to everyone) that I was planning on laying off the political crap if others did the same. To some extent, they followed through (though at the end of the election cycle their enthusiasm for stupidity got the better of them, but I tried to ignore it).Anyway, I mostly kept up my end of the bargain, so I‚Äôve had to give up posting Zmanbons motsfor the sake of FB comity. Maybe I can now resume my passive-aggressive poking of the hornets‚Äô net.Thanks for all the material!

        This is the best blog on the internet, hands down. I appreciate your thoughtful, informed perspective and keen historical background.I can‚Äôt say that I necessarily identify entirely with the alt-right, but like lots of Americans I am sick to death of the government and the MSM pissing on my leg and telling me that it‚Äôs raining. It‚Äôs a sad commentary on the state of our country when the alt-right conspiracy theorists on the internet become more credible than the mainstream media organs.Keep up the good work. The Trump administration should provide a lot of fodder for discussion. Personally, I‚Äôd like to see more discussion here about what the Republicans and/or the alt-right can do to keep the Democrats on their current suicidal lurch into left-wing ideology driven politics so that Republicans can occupy and hold the center ground. One more all red state (or one fewer all blue state‚ÄìCalexit!) and the Republicans can amend the Constitution without interference from the Democrats.P.S. Your most interesting post was the post about microdosing. Amazing.

            Dear Guest: Just to reply to your statement ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sad commentary on the state of our country when the alt-right conspiracy theorists on the internet become more credible than the mainstream media organs,‚Äù that is the state of our country for sure.  But sad, no, I don‚Äôt see it that way.  Call it creative destruction, the old falling away and becoming irrelevant, whatever.  What gives me hope is the spirit embodied in this kind of movement that can upend such an entrenched, rich and powerful monster.  It is the quick and agile using new methods against the stodgy old, slow and stuck in old ways that we are seeing triumph today.So the left can pout and cry and shout and burn and destroy, but to no end.  The die is cast and with leaders like Zman, new energy, life force has been given to the Deplorables.  When all is said and done, people like Zman will go down in history as did Ben Franklin using his wit and wisdom from many fields to educate his generation and future generations.  Lots of work to be done in the coming years and good, thought provoking  dialog is not limited to the inner circle of the Trump Administration.  We, the People, have a voice too.  Thanks Zman!

        What is your name? I quote you often on my blog and would like to share it . You are perhaps my favorite writer/blogger, up there with Victor Davis Hanson.

        Don‚Äôt remember how I ended up here, but after reading My Theory of Everything, which I found quite readable andthoughtful, I started making it a regular stop. Once a day for the blog and two or three times for the comments. Great place. Thanks zman.

        It appears that America‚Äôs Best Funded Hate Group, the SPLC, supplied a list of Evil White Supreeemacists for Twitter to ban.Now, I‚Äôm not a White Supreemacist at all, but I got on SPLC‚Äôs radar about 6 months ago when I got in a Twitter Slap Fight with an Anti-White Sociology Professor and posted FBI Crime Stats and Racial IQ data.Turns out he was Jewish and connected to SPLC and they wrote me up the next day and I‚Äôve been on their list of EVIL WHITE SUPREEEMACISTS ever since.In SPLC‚Äôs world, any criticism of Blacks ‚Äì including accurately citing FBI Crime Stats ‚Äì is proof of WHITE SUPREEEMACISM.Funny thing, their write-up of me proving I was an Evil White Supreemacist included IQ &amp; FBI Crime Data I posted that showed East Asians have higher avg IQs and lower homicide rates than Whites.But facts don‚Äôt matter to the SPLC. And they get to decide who gets purged in 2016.Besides, they have to regularly manufacture new White Supreemacists to fight in order to scare the Retired Old Jews they‚Äôre scamming into donating every 6 months. It‚Äôs their Business Model.
