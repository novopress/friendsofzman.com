        How’s that “Smart Diplomacy” working?
Here’s a great piece. Neocons and red diaper baby cultural marxist’s in cahoots together. More like a jr varsity team in cheap sneakers, just got their arises handed to them for all the world to see. Except if you live in murica! where we got freedom of the press.Couldn’t happen to a nicer group of psychopaths:

        The twelfth largest economy in the world is bullying the world’s first place economy.
I wonder how much Putin spends on funding birth control for college girls or buying cell phones for his urban poor.

        This isn’t the same Russian army that fought in the 80s, and the Russians don’t have lawyers looking over their shoulders delineating the international rules.

        **One of the stranger things about living in America is the lack of a news media.**
When Soviets visited the US during the 1980s they were surprised that just like Russia, every newspaper and TV news program all had the same stories. It turns out that government intervention is not necessary for that to happen.

        I wonder how long the Russians can maintain the pace of operations in Syria? They are famous for sophisticated systems (aircraft, tanks, ships, missiles) that don’t hold up over an extended campaign. Historically, their organizational maintenance units were small (often non existent), under trained and poorly supplied. This is not much of a handicap when your operational practices consist of mass, followed by more mass, followed by, more mass. A modern fighter bomber requires hours of maintenance for every hour flown. Not to mention a very deep supply of spare parts from bolts to engines. There’s a reason why western air forces can fly F16s for 25 years and why the Indian Air Force is hankering for western aircraft.Supporting a smallish expeditionary force is certainly well within their budget, but over time it’s going to get expensive to maintain a pace of operations to keep ISIS off balance. Plus I further question the durability of Syrian ground troops.

        I am probably being impolite by calling Obama a coward, but Putin’s skills parallel the shark who can detect blood in the water. Obama’s weaknesses (or possibly a design for a weaker America) are chum to the ‘shark’.
As someone famously said, Putin is playing chess while Obama plays checkers (or was that golf?).

            Putin is on a roll now, but in fact for several years he did not believe that Obama was the fool he takes him for now. The Soviet intelligence community assumed that this was all political posturing and that it was merely a polished product of another American ruse.No one could possibly mean the things which he said.In the 1980’s my brother-in-law was detached from Army Intelligence for eighteen months to accept a position with the UN peacekeeping authority in the middle-east. It was composed mainly of Americans, Europeans, and Russians. The Russian officers lived to be in the company of Americans. This caused resentment among the Europeans, but it was a dynamic which was virtually unavoidable for the Americans. The Russian identity was based on being the great protagonist of the most powerful and dynamic country on earth. They liked being our enemy because it was all the only link to greatness they were capable of. So they could make no sense of Obama by taking him at his word. When they realized differently it was like finding out every babe at the party was putting out no questions asked. They are having fun now for the first time since they pissed all over jimmy carter.I will admit to cracking a smile now and again over this. Does anyone else? My greater enemy is at home, and that is true for the Europeans as well.

        One of the issues that the west should be careful about is that the Russians are (finally) getting some proper military practice.We have got used to the west, notably America, getting valuable hands-on experience of fighting. That includes the matter of logistics, medical expertise, troop  morale and so on. These conflicts may or may not be successful but they got military matters initiated, examined and polished. The Russians could only look at having military experience in small areas and as they have little spare cash they couldn’t train effectively. I am led to believe Russian fighter pilots spent far more time in the classroom on theory than actual flying as it was so expensive.Now they are getting the practice they need in Syria. Once they get that practice, they will fancy doing more. Now all military engines overreach themselves eventually, but once Putin’s people feel they are on a roll, watch out for more of this kind of thing.

            The interesting thing to me about the Russians is Putin is ushering in a massive philosophical change. The Russians have based their military on the massive use people, defense in depth and distance. The AK-47 is a great example. You can make a lot of them cheaply, they work in all conditions and they are easy to use. You hand out a bunch of them to poorly trained soldiers and rely on volume.The use of small, adaptable units equipped with the best available tools is an Anglo-American way that grew out of our culture. I’m skeptical about how well that can be adopted by Russians. Those are my people and my people don’t do hippy very well.

        Merkel will be no problem for Putin. She has been and is a fellow traveler. Putin can simply watch as Merkel concentrates on higher priced energy and placing large numbers of militant Islamic young men. Russia will continue to get payback for German treachery after the Polish adventure many decades ago.

            I think Merkel understands that Germany can never be in a war on which they are not on the side of Russia. The rule sh seems to be operating from is that Germany must always be on the side with the most resources and that side has to include Russia. While we still have Straussian idiots running US foreign policy. Germany operates as a broker between the US and Russia. Once the US withdraws from Europe, Germany will rule over Europe with Russia.

                London and neocons are not going to like that new arrangement. Migrant “crisis” is playing into their hands. I see it every day here in my part of the world. Merkel made a big mistake inviting them. Now she is putting the whole EU project in jeopardy.

        I’ll believe ISIS might be defeated when they are, and that they are when they have been for fifteen years.
Remember the Anbar Awakening?
We killed a lot of people too. The Soviets killed a lot of people in Afghanistan. A lot of people have killed a lot of people.

        This is probably a ploy to push up oil prices as much as an opportunity to extend Russian influence, but I’m sure that’s seen as a nice bonus.
