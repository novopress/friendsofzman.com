        Duck,
The Mass Media is the new vatican.  They preach at you out of the New and Improved Testament.

        My grandfather used to say of golf; hitting a little white ball and then chasing after it.  I enjoyed golf as a young man but after the arrival of children I no longer had the time to pursue it.  Working 5 days and very frequently away on business trips over the weekend left me little time with my family and it seemed selfish to devote a whole day of my off time leaving the wife and kids home. Well now the kids are grown and gone and I have the time but I no longer want to “hit a little white ball and chase after it.”  Not judging, just saying.

            I played some golf a decade ago or so, but my peers were never much into it. I’m not all that interested in making new friends just to play golf so I dropped it. I may hit the driving range on occasion to get some sun and exercise, but that’s it. I think if my friends were into it, I’d play as it seems like a fine way to kill a few hours. Instead, I spend my leisure time in the gym or on my bike. It’s cheap, I can do it when I have a free hour or two in the day and I don’t have to do it with others.

        Golf is an interesting phenomena in the world of sports. Most sports require some talent, and probably speed (which is almost exclusively available to the younger end of the species), but golf — oft described as a long walk spoilt by carrying a stick and having to hit a ball — is tailored to age. Increasingly so, too.The original concept of golf, played on a links course, is essentially battling with the elements on the fringe of land where the sea threatens to take control. But the appeal of the game was eased by building sheltered, inland and very gentle (for that read  heavily manicured) landscapes that would allow ease of access and with it, golf buggies.What used to be a shelter from the wind and the seagulls has become a clubhouse, with drinks and more drinks.As such it is ideal for the older person but, putting aside snobbish clubs and expenses, the golf fraternity is also faced with a hostile ‘enviro-mental’ lobby who see building golf courses as despoiling the countryside. As these nut cases want to stop everyone doing anything and have a moral high horse supported by their friends in the media, getting to play this game seems a lot of hard work and potentially  troublesome.This is what we are faced with now. Once you could more or less do what you wanted (if legal) and if people disapproved, they ignored you. Now we have the young being pumped up to be ‘social justice warriors,’ willing to hassle people to stop them doing legal things on some pretext of saving the planet or making things fair for squirrels.This is the change in society. We, in priming aggressive youth, have become at war with ourselves over minor issues while cleverly avoiding the big issues. If I had to point out what the difference was between 1960 and 2010 it is the concept of ‘live and let live’ has been utterly trashed.I don’t care a fig about golf (my bad back won’t allow me to do it properly) but I do care that we have cultivated a society where people can have a strong objection to it just because they can’t think of anything else to object to.

        Demographically, 1945-1964 was a unit.  Sociologically … not so much.  Coming of age in 1982 was not at all the same as coming of age in 1963!But, that trivial quibble aside, your point’s well taken.I believe one reason your explanation isn’t getting more media play is that it’s one more reminder to the 1945-1955 cohort of Boomers that they’re getting OLD, which is something that they’ve been uninterested in hearing for the past two decades, and will continue to be uninterested in hearing until they reach utter inanition.A related phenomenon is that, even though we are living in the year 2015, and are having problems in America that are profoundly different from the ones we had in 1965, all Serious Political Discussions about issues such as race are being carried on as if it were still 1963, and we hadn’t had five decades of life after both the Civil Rights Act and 1965’s changes in immigration law.  That particular cognitive arrest is causing no end of stupid public debate and stupider political decisions.

            Erich, I completely agree on the vast difference in perspective between those born in 1950 and 1960.  A teenage in the late sixties lived in a different country than those in the mid-to-late 70’s. The 80’s, of course, were even more different. I saw PJ O’Rourke out humping his latest book and he was making the claim that “his generation” included those born in the mid-60’s, which is ridiculous.

        Amazing how none of the big sci fi writers ever figured out that the problem would be depopulation, not over population.
Samuel Delany called what you are describing “cultural fugue,” but like most, he figured we’d get to the stars before the information overload became great enough to cause it.  Writers who imagined galactic empires in the next 1,000 years could hardly come up with something vaguely as powerful as a smartphone (and that usually only a terminal, not a network node with real computing power) in a million.

        Mass Media is a recent phenomenon but is interesting to note that has been controlled by the same people that (supposedly) wrote the Bible, who makes the narrative that we live by?
