        Sorry to be off-topic but I didn‚Äôt have any other place to ask.I‚Äôve been living in Thailand for the last 13 years but I visit back home to Colorado once a year to spend time with my parents and enjoy the summer. I was raised in an extremely liberal town and I was pretty typical of the people there (I still to this day have never met a Republican that I am aware of).Since I‚Äôve been coming back home I‚Äôve noticed the staggering rise of Latino people flooding in to the state and because of my experience in the 3rd world I‚Äôm extremely worried given that I *know* where this is going.My friends and family back home are deeply entrenched in the idea of multiculturalism and have little to no tolerance for my (now) heretical views on race. They‚Äôre not bad people but they just don‚Äôt know any better given how sheltered they are from ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù.The panic reached a peak this summer when I saw a picture in my parents house that said something like ‚Äúclass of 2025‚Äù and it was of an entirely Latino elementary school class. Apparently they‚Äôre donating to schools with non-White populations (sickening).I‚Äôm really disturbed by this given my step dad never had kids of his own and his reason was ‚Äúthe world already has too many people‚Äù. He was gracious in taking in me and my brother, he‚Äôs a good Christian man from Kansas, but this feels like a betrayal and treason almost. It breaks my heart to know that these otherwise well intentioned people are literally giving away our state out of ignorance and naivety.I find solace in reading blogs like this one where people actually acknowledge what‚Äôs happening and that we White people are a nation of our own and you can‚Äôt replace us with other peoples children.So anyways, thank you for listening and thank you for the blog. If anyone knows of any other content that you‚Äôd think a person like me would enjoy please let me know.

A lot of rural CO in the mountains is leftist, due to white liberals buying houses there for ski. The Hispanic population there works in the travel industry jobs. Lots of illegals and legal guest workers that presumably aren‚Äôt voting, but then again this is a mail ballot only state. CO also has legacy Hispanics from the Spanish days in the Pueblo area. Trump actually won this county as you can see on the map, Reagan never did.

                    I have no idea about demographics in CO now. I‚Äôve just learned in the last few months that we have all-Hispanic schools in Denver and surrounding areas (maybe some we legacy as you mentioned). 95% of the yard workers I saw last summer looked like new recruits from south of the border. When I left all those jobs were still held by white kids like me. The flood gates are open now and entire generations of kids from illegals are appearing in the schools, parks, etc‚Ä¶ Shocking to say the least.

                        Read my post below. This has been happening for 35 years in Colorado. The kids appearing in schools, parks, etc. are just as likely the grandchildren of illegal aliens who arrived 10-30 years ago with their kids in tow. You were insulated from it by high housing prices in the liberal enclave of Boulder. Welcome to reality, kid. Life comes at you fast.Make your parents face their rank hypocrisy when you are back next summer. Go out for dinner in northeast Denver or Westminster instead of lily-white Boulder. Make them drive down 36 and exit Sheridan and go South into Denver, or exit Federal and go either North or South. You‚Äôll drive miles on Federal without seeing white people or even many signs in English. Drive them over to Commerce City and Brighton. See if they can put 2 and 2 together.

            The situation you‚Äôre describing is so bad that not only normal people are terrified of it, but even native-born criminals. I remember reading a book by Edward Bunker (a lifelong con) who talked about getting out of prison after fifteen years or so and returning to his old digs in Southern California and being overwhelmed by how quickly LA had devolved into Mexico. It is definitely true that people who have expatriated (like you) or been taken out of society (like Bunker) have a clearer view than those of us who‚Äôve been sitting here the whole time as the world changed around us. It‚Äôs that Parable of the Boiled Frog. It may feel like a Jacuzzi but we‚Äôre cooking.

                The white rich people in the suburbs are the ones most in favor of mass immigration it seems but they are the ones who will experience diversity last. These people have done so much to destroy the country and they don‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre living in the hallowed out carcass of the America they grew up in.

Gated communities with armed guards, high-etch burglar alarms and armored vehicles ‚Äì and life will go on as before. The wealthy will insulate themselves from diversity ‚Äì unless the odd riot breaks out in their neighborhood, that is.

            Okay, I‚Äôve written extensively about Colorado on this blog before but I‚Äôll give it another go.Colorado is a case study in how to turn a red state blue by implementing sanctuary city policies which encouraged illegal immigration. This began long before you left, during Denver Mayor Pena‚Äôs tenure beginning in 1983 (before open borders was the formal policy of the Democrats), but really took off during Mayor Webb‚Äôs administration beginning in 1991 and has continued unabated under Mayor Hickenlooper and Mayor Hancock. Colorado‚Äôs legislature and Governors, like many others in the US, stood by for 35 years and did nothing as illegal immigrants poured into the Denver area.Denver is now approximately 35% Hispanic. There are entire areas of Denver which would appear to be in Mexico or Central America. This was true when you lived here 13 years ago. Denver Public Schools are approximately 55% Hispanic, so the demographic future of Denver is predetermined. However, the influx of people from California (more damn Democrats) is driving gentrification, which is pushing Hispanics into the suburbs north of the city.Although political analysts refer to Colorado as a purple state, the truth is that it is now a blue state with a few legacy Republicans holding on for their political lives. The last Republican governor was elected in 1999. There will never be another. Democrats hold the House and this year they are likely to take the Senate. Republicans will never hold power again in Colorado.At the Federal level, Senator Corey Gardner (a squishy moderate Republican if ever there was one) will almost certainly lose in 2020. Colorado has 7 representatives: 4R, 3D. Mike Coffman‚Äôs district has turned blue due entirely to immigration and he will likely lose in 2018 so it will go 3R, 4D. Colorado will likely gain a district following the 2020 election. It will be blue.The only way I can see Colorado going red again is if the federal government rescinds the subsidy schedule for the Obamacare Medicaid expansion program. Medicaid expansion put another 550,000 people on the Medicaid in Colorado at a cost of nearly a billion dollars, 97% of which is covered by the feds. (Nearly 25% of Colorado‚Äôs population is now covered by Medicaid.) If Colorado taxpayers had to cover even 50% of the cost of Medicaid expansion the state would go red again in a heartbeat.

            I spent 6 years in Boulder and Aspen. When I left Aspen in 1993 the local restaurants started hiring illegal immigrants who couldn‚Äôt speak English. One night a group of Guatemalans got into a knife fight with a group of Columbians or Hondurans at the downtown bus stop. The letters to the editor were a laugh riot: how could this happen in our sweet little town (of white people)?
Because those every day low low prices have a downside, darlin.

            I am in the same boat you are. My family is much the same. I had to live in the world they refused to see. As the problems became more obvious they became less tolerant of my fascism/homophobia/racism/sexism/hateyness‚Ä¶and our family broke.It‚Äôs weird, being unpersoned and exiled for violating the family‚Äôs code of conduct: sure, there‚Äôs bitterness and anger‚Ä¶ but there is peace and freedom that everyone deserves too.It‚Äôs a cliche now, but‚Ä¶ if you ever feel the need, listen to your heart and walk away.

        No slave revolt has ever succeeded on its own. Even the Haitian revolution only succeeded because the mulatto gentry came to support it after seeing an opportunity to replace the French as the rulers of Haiti.We will eventually need our own elites, and to do this we will have to change how we thinkThe right has a problem with what I call ‚Äúclausewitzian thinking‚Äù. Clausewitz was a military thinker with a great many merits, but his thought is bound up in the conflict between organised states. He taught the merits of seeking battle to produce a decisive result. The right is too bound up in this idea that some decisive moment or person will come along and bring victory. It assumes fairly equal sides, a committed elite that leads us and acknowledged rules.We have none of those.Clausewitzian thinking shackles us, and keeps us from putting in the work to produce actual movements capable to exercising power.The right needs to shift its frame. Clausewitzian thinking no longer applies. We are a resistance movement, and we need to think like one. What is needed is a right wing Maoist frame of thought. We need to overcome our obsession with personalities, hierarchies and political eschatology and build proper, cellular distributed movements dedicated to obtaining power. This will mean temporarily compromising on principles in order to create new broad coalitions that can be carefully subverted.It will mean adopting the enemies techniques of deconstruction. It means a completely different way of thinking and organising that eschews nuremsperger dreams of some Fuhrer leading us to victory in the streets and embraces a long, grinding war of attrition against a far greater power.

            This is a point I have made in the past, often tot he alt-right guys, who see themselves as a vanguard. Our situation is much more analogous to the Irish and the Hindus under British rule. Direct confrontation is futile. Instead, the resistance has to focus on making the cost of rule prohibitively expensive.

                It‚Äôs hard to throw out an occupying entity by force, but it is much easier to make huge swaths of territory functionally ungovernable. At that point, the occupier only has a couple of options, all of them bad. He can simply put up with the fact that his rule effectively ends at the borders of his capital city (as is the case in American-occupied Afghanistan). He can pour money and resources into enforcing his rule until he can‚Äôt maintain the expense anymore and has to make a strategic retreat (as was the case in Soviet-occupied Afghanistan). If the locals can be talked into it, he can save face by granting them home rule while technically keeping them as subjects (Northern Ireland). Or he can pack up and leave his colonial possessions more or less voluntarily (Britain after WWII). None of these are good options, and none of them have the slightest appeal to fanatical utopian world-savers like the left. But as much as they like to believe that they can resist reality forever, they can‚Äôt.

                    How hard is it to literally burn crops? Take away the drug income and there is no more Taliban. There is no intention of winning, either by the corrupt Afghan leaders or by the desire of the Deep State to flood Iran with opium.

                @Dirtnapninja and Zman:There is an interesting series on Amazon Prime Video (I know, I know‚Ä¶ but I haven‚Äôt had a cable box since 2008‚Ä¶) called ‚ÄúThe Man in the High Castle.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs up to season 3. And it is an interesting dystopian view of the world, under the scenario of the Axis having won WWII. So the ‚ÄúReich‚Äù is in the East, and the ‚ÄúJapanese States‚Äù are in the West. The middle is the Neutral Zone.My point in sharing this is related to Dirtnapninja‚Äôs comment about philosophy and how it influences movements.What‚Äôs interesting about this teevee series is that the resistance is just that: the resistance. They get a few good sucker punches in to the powers that be, here and there, but largely, they are a rag-tag bunch of groups in different cities from Montana down to New Mexico. There‚Äôs no leadership, but there is a black market.It‚Äôs really interesting, and could be what unfolds for us in modern-day.Except with technology, which makes it trickier.

                    The nature of resistance is that it loses far more often than it wins. And no resistance can win without1) external assistance or2) help from a faction of elites.The left had both..they had the backing from the soviets and an internal faction of wealthy and powerful with a vested interest in backing them. After the USSR fell, the billionaire fake charity foundations took over the role as sugar daddies, and now we are at where we are at.We cannot ‚Äòwin‚Äô.But we can help create enough chaos and polarisation that the elites themselves start to feud. At this point one faction may begin taking an interest in supporting us. Failing that, a foreign power may take in interest in supporting us. Until then the first priority is surviving. And to do this requires we learn from the masters themselves..the left.

            I often say this as a joke, but it arguably isn‚Äôt anymore. They want us put in the position of only being allowed to use postal money orders and printed newsletters. And they‚Äôll probably ban the latter if it was threatening enough.

        Remember that this is all part of a bigger picture. It‚Äôs not just about trashing the Constitution and abrogating laws. It‚Äôs about memetic subversion of an entire species. It‚Äôs about turning the masses into hive-minded worker drones via repetitious messaging &amp; managed indoctrination. That is why they must censor Gab and its ilk. Do not be fooled. This is not simply a legal fight over Constitutional principles. It‚Äôs deadly serious warfare against 2 million years of evolution.

        I‚Äôll be honest, since (technically) I don‚Äôt think we can be punished for our thoughts (yet). It could be the time I spent in Germany, and my roots there, but when I heard about someone shooting up a religious institution involved in the refugee resettlement racket, a paraphrase of Obama‚Äôs buddy Bill Ayers came to mind: ‚ÄúI wish he‚Äôd done more.‚Äù Unlike the MAGA CivNat guy, whose pipe bombs looked like something out of an Acme cartoon, the Pittsburgh shooter seems to have taken the Breivik route and gone for the matador instead of the cape. If our culture war were still a cold war, maybe I could work up the pro forma ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù B.S. for the ‚Äúvictims.‚Äù But those ‚Äúvictims‚Äù were perfectly comfortable creating the kind of society Europe already has, where a man can go to prison for reporting on barbarians raping and enslaving a houseful of mentally retarded girls. So yeah, fuck them. And if someone as even-keeled as me feels this way right now, there‚Äôs no telling where this country is heading. It‚Äôs just a fusion reaction of the left doubling down on suppression and antagonizing and the people in the country getting angrier and more enraged. And that ‚Äúsmug face‚Äù that a Scott Hammond or a Stephen Colbert has is even worse than cuckface.

            I wonder if this isn‚Äôt the ‚ÄúJohn Brown Moment‚Äù of the 21st century.  Read anything from the late 1850s; there‚Äôs this palpable sense of ‚Äúfuck it, let‚Äôs do this already!‚Äù in the air‚Ä¶ and not just in hindsight; people frequently commented on it at the time.  Even after Harper‚Äôs Ferry there were still lots of people trying to iron out political solutions, but the most common reaction seemed to be a sigh of relief: ‚ÄúFinally!!‚Äù  I don‚Äôt know if the synagogue shooting is that or not, but one thing is sure: The next few weeks are going to be *really* interesting.

            I‚Äôve been saying for a very long time that the Clintons are the inflection point in American politics. When Progs could not bring themselves to purge those grifters from the Ozarks, the die was cast. The Snopes clan had won.

                The Snopes clan?  We should be so lucky.  If dregs like Booker and Harris are what the Dem future has to offer, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more like the Bundrens who won.

                Hey, hey, hey, I live in the Ozarks, and the Clintons ain‚Äôt from here.  Bill is no-account trash from southern Arkansas, and of course Hillary was a transplant from Chicago. They lived and reigned in Little Rock, which may well be corrupt and blue, but it‚Äôs well south of the Ozarks.
It‚Äôs bad enough to be lampooned by a crummy Netflix show, now we‚Äôre being tied to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Satan of the modern Democratic Party.  Unjust!

                    @Shrugger:  Hear hear!  Northern Arkansas/the Ozarks is a beautiful area with lots of WHITE families and kids.  My husband and I took a brief trip there a few months ago.  En route, at a pit stop in Clinton‚Äôs hometown of Hope, saw a bunch of veiled Muslimas.  Once up north there were no pajeets, almost no Han, no blacks, a handful of Mexicans.  If we had won last week‚Äôs lotteries we‚Äôd be out of the DFW area and buy acreage there stat.  It was like being back in America, and we loved it.

                            Shrugger ‚Äì yes, we met quite a few transplants ‚Äì from Texas, Florida, and a ton of oldsters from Chicago.  But the vast majority are White Christians, and in the smaller towns (pop 200 ‚Äì 2000) most are locals who‚Äôve been there for generations.  Classic, salt-of-the-earth Americans.  While we cannot afford to move yet, that‚Äôs our goal and we have a number of like-minded friends here who are similarly enamored, after hearing our report and seeing our pictures.

            It was the Senate GOP that made Sessions promise not to go after Hillary during his confirmation hearings.  I remember FoxNews televising it and saying nothing about it.
Of course it should not come as a surprise given that the Senate GOP was all prepared to work with Hillary the President and that Ryan and McConnell actively opposed Trump during the campaign.
They actually got together with BigTech at Sea Island to figure out how to stop Trump.
You wonder why the GOP is silent on BigTech? Because they‚Äôve been working with them.

        As an aside, I am very encouraged by the fact that Trump seems to have learned his lesson when it comes to not touching the third rail of gun control after a big mass shooting. When the press challenged him on it this time, he just brushed it aside and went on the attack against the media. It seems he *does* take failed A/B testing to heart.

            Have you ever wondered what would happen were the big TV and cable networks to experience transmission difficulties for a few days, simultaneously. I have, tee hee.But seriously, in all this distillation of opinions and refining of strategy that led us to a short list of bad elements I‚Äôve never heard anyone declare the MSM a target for anything but silent disgust. ‚ÄúKill your TV‚Äù had a nice ring to it. I sense we‚Äôre all on board with that. But the media has a one-to-many configuration. Thinking in terms of efficiency, a ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù at the source of transmission is far less work.The FCC has many licensing requirements, none less a priority than ‚Äútransmission capability and consistency.‚Äù And here I was assuming the FCC was regulating content. Nope! They‚Äôre more concerned that broadcasters maintain an unbroken spigot of puke. To my knowledge, it has never been unbroken. So I reflect on Occupy Wall street and recall that MSM pretended it wasn‚Äôt there for at least 2 weeks. Perhaps they were working out an agreed upon story angle? Perhaps too the snipers were getting into position? What remains of the Occupy Wall Street legacy I feel is still a viable tactic is it‚Äôs decentralized nature.Cut to a scene of a security guard nervously passing a card key to some douchey looking millennial, a cable broadcasting engineer with a secret interest in activism. Camera pulls back to reveal the engineer crouching beside some equipment. Close up of tools being tossed into a backpack followed by a laptop. Camera follows inside the backpack, ominously revealing inside a Guy Fawkes mask!‚ÄúSir, they got CNN and MSNBC-R! The north-east PBS affiliates are saying it‚Äôs a glitch. We can confirm CBS, ABC, KRON-TV, WTBS.‚ÄùSo I ask again, what would happen were the above scenario to play out and 6-10 major networks go dark for 2 or 3 days? Bear in mind that the techniques used wouldn‚Äôt pose any risk of harm to anyone and cause only minimal damage to property. In other words, one could accurately describe it as acts of vandalism. Well, it‚Äôs a sure thing the MSM would declare it America‚Äôs worst terror attack and there would be 10 minutes of silence at all future Academy Awards presentations.I think, despite all the MSM hysteria the weight of public opinion would overtake it in the historical record. A silent Hurrah, and the Americans responsible would be deemed heroes. Maybe a few neighbors would finally exchange introductions. Maybe the revolution would finally begin.

        Two things:1. The cloud people use the term democracy the way European monarchies used divine right of kings. They also use the word assault to conjure up a violent war-like  attack, when it is always the case that the assault they are talking about is one of political dissent. An ‚Äúassault‚Äù on either the divinely appointed king or the sacred idea of democracy is evil and must be repressed by any means necessary. The cloud people have won the semantics/propaganda game.2. The term contract of adhesion was first used by courts to get ghetto people out of high-interest credit purchases, usually of furniture. All the bad stuff was in the fine print, which the buyer supposedly couldn‚Äôt read or understand. The term was later expanded to contracts such as Z describes. All terms of service contracts with giant companies, including utilities and social media, are contracts of adhesion. If you want to heat your house you have to sign the contract. If you want to communicate via social media, you have to sign the contract. The Trump-appointed Supreme Court will be dealing with this issue some day.

        As Vox Day would say, the top-level of US-based internet companies are fully converged. The good news is that the Internet is global and you don‚Äôt need to be tied to a US company. Sad to say, but in The Current Year the US is probably on the bottom of the list in terms of support for free speech. If you are looking for free speech, it‚Äôs better to go to Eastern Europe, Asia or the Middle East. (Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that sentence was possible to write 25 years ago.)Here‚Äôs a complete list of DNS Registrars:https://www.icann.org/registrar-reports/accredited-list.htmlThere are thousands of ISPs in Asia.At this point, any web site which is even modestly oriented toward dissident politics is clearly on notice: move your business out of the US of you will only have yourself to blame when you get shut down.

            I think you are wrong about the Middle East.  Since forever, the NSA has shared its hacks with them, and they have decrypted everything.  And they aren‚Äôt shy about showing you the decrypted communications they have, to prove the point that none of your encrypted communications actually are.  And this has been going in in the Middle East for DECADES.  A Middle Eastern hacker let me know that even Bitcoin and crypto-currency is outlawed.  If you want to use a cyber-cafe, you need government issued id and it is tied to your IP address during the time you are in the cafe.  Free speech in the Middle East?  I don‚Äôt think so.  Young people there are naive, send nude selfies‚Ä¶ and now the government authorities make them do whatever they want.  The system is and will collapse; ISIS would have gotten no traction, except that so many females were compromised by their nude selfies and thus manipulable by shame.

            Most people in the middle regard us with hostility. They think Ben Shapiro is ‚Äúfar-right‚Äù, and probably a ‚Äúwhite nationalist‚Äù, the Anti-White New York Times said so. Just as most other developed countries ban the average person from owning firearms, they also ban most forms of far-right activism.

            Peterson is correct. You can‚Äôt get through five comments in any conservative blog without some dick head and his triple parenthesis blaming everything on the Jews. Jews are of above average intelligence, work hard and, unlike Asians, they are good communicators; hence they‚Äôve achieved positions of power in the U.S. So Cooter and his AR-15 hate the powers that be, so they hate the Jews.

You could say the same thing about blacks, hispanics and women, including my wife.

And my above post already has a net -3 vote, meaning a plurality of commenters on this blog are anti-semites, which is disappointing.

                The two most important existential issues for whites (handed down through ages of Anglo-Saxon custom and after much struggle and bloodshed) are the right to free speech and the right to self-defense. The organized Jewish community is demonstrably, vocally, and proudly on the wrong side of this issue. Your friend Morrie the Ambulance Chaser with gold chains may be Jewish, but not part of the organized Jewish community, though on the third important issue (national sovereignty) even rank and file non-hostile Jews are usually pro-open borders due to the Ellis Island schmaltz (in all fairness, your ‚ÄúBridge and Tunnel‚Äù type Italians are also susceptible to this). Audacious Epigone has done a lot of good work on this, if you care and you‚Äôre not just trying to obfuscate.

                Re: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get through five comments in any conservative blog without some dick head and his triple parenthesis blaming everything on the Jews.‚ÄùTaken as a whole, mainstream WASP America isn‚Äôt an intolerant or bigoted place. Genuine anti-Semitism is rare. Even those people who might feel animosity toward them (or any other identity group) pretty much know the score ‚Äì that such discourse is verboten in today‚Äôs USA.In light of this fact, the appearance of anti-Semitic comments, like clockwork, on conservative websites strikes me as one of two, perhaps three things.First, since the internet is a worldwide phenomenon, in principle there is absolutely no reason the intelligence services and/or cyber-warfare services of nations like Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, to name a few Muslim nations,  can‚Äôt post such remarks as a sort of counter to the increasing scrutiny they ‚Äì the Islamic world ‚Äì are under in this, the Age of Trump.Second, it is nearly-certain that Soros-backed groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and the like are sowing anti-Semitic comments on conservative websites as quickly as they can, since the presence of such comments can then be used as a basis for criticism of these same websites and their authors. The deep-state can plant ‚Äúanti-Semitic comments‚Äù just about anywhere these days ‚Äì including in the digital existence of perceived enemies of the status quo.Third, there exists a backlash against the neo-conservative movement, in particular its interventionist foreign policy, within the younger generations, and even within the ranks of the ‚ÄúNormies‚Äù as well. There has been a concerted effort by the Left to link criticism ‚Äì any criticism ‚Äì of their program, as anti-Semitic. Including neo-Wilsonian and neo-con policies.The deep-state establishment loves to accuse its opponents of anti-Semitism since that also allows them to deploy the Nazi card, their ultimate insult.

                    Georgiaboy61, your comment leads to the point that we need to know who we are dealing with, and pay attention.  There is a nucleus of commenters here that are known entities, and each of them brings something to the conversation.  We need to be careful of unknown outside ‚Äúnew‚Äù commenters.  Not to be all cliquey or anything, but a big value of this site, as it was envisioned by Z, is to provide a robust and useful commentary in the threads.  Today‚Äôs comments are generally exceptional in that regard.  But we need to do some self-policing, and it is in our interest to do so.  Don‚Äôt give Tiny Duck too much leash.  The JQ is an easy trap for the Soros types to plant, and since there are many aspects to the question, it is easy to fall into a trap that makes a mess of things.

Next time it will be mainstream right-of-center sites like gun and 2nd Amendment forums. Don‚Äôt think so? Look at how some banks and credit card companies already refuse to do business with gun stores, how the NY AG told banks it was ‚Äúin their interest‚Äù to not do business with the NRA. What‚Äôs your favorite gun forum? The registry for their domain name might decide it‚Äôs not ‚Äúin their interest‚Äù to resolve lookups for them anymore, especially when the Outrage Machine is looking for its next target.

        In regards to Stefan Molyneaux, you are correct ‚Äì his brand is shot, and I can tell that he has changed his style to avoid offending the PTB. It really shook him up.

        I frequently see on this blog and others like it predictions for future revolutions, uprisings, etc.  I understand the anger that is brewing in our country but I also know most Americans are fat, lazy and flat out wusses for the most part.  Most folks are living a comfortable enough life that they are unwilling to rise up and fight.  They will vent and complain on the internet all day but how many are really willing to lay down their lives for a cause?  How many in our country are noble like Stonewall Jackson?  Are millions willing to shed their blood for what needs to be done?  I am very skeptic of that.I think America will go down much like the Roman Empire did.  A slow, steady moral decline while at the same time a constant erosion of the middle class.  In about 50 years America will be a shithole with no middle class and 80% of the country dependent on wellfare.  Perhaps as robotics and technology continue to improve, the 80% on welfare will continue to not care as long as the internet, electricity and cable TV are still working.  This reminds me of a certain movie called ‚ÄúIdiocracy‚Äù‚Ä¶

When the tech giants‚Äô employees risk being ‚Äúde-platformed‚Äù themselves, it‚Äôs past the point of no return.  Forget guys like Hammond.  We assume that in places like Mexico, judges are corrupt.  Maybe they are, or maybe they aren‚Äôt ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt matter, because cops won‚Äôt investigate and prosecutors won‚Äôt prosecute.  I doubt a Mexican judge does five minutes of work a day.

BigTech has been working hard at replacing white American tech workers with foreigners since the mid 90‚Äôs. The guys running those firms from Gates, Brin, Ellison, Zucky, etc. don‚Äôt like Americans at all. Hence their concerted efforts at removing their fellow whites from their companies and supporting political efforts to destroy the American people as a whole through demographic replacement.
Have you ever taken a good look at those tech CEO‚Äôs? Most look like  like creepy little men and act very much like creepy little men. Physiognomy is real.

                    American workers have a tendency to talk back, quit when unsatisfied, and start their own companies. You don‚Äôt see it much today, but they are also more inclined to unionize. Plenty of FOB Asians are happy to be a tech drone, and immigrants due to selection bias tend to be harder workers.If we are talking illegals in service industry jobs, there are a lot of cash payments that dodge taxes. Legal guest workers are especially preferred in hotels and landscaping, as they make around 10x what they would in Mexico. So they work hard for 6 months and take the rest of the year off back in their home country.

                    When it comes to doctors, there is a loophole in the visa system that allows an uncapped number of doctors to immigrate to the US provided they work in a ‚Äúlow income‚Äù area for residency (80 hour work weeks). There is a reluctance to fund more training of native physicians, and we don‚Äôt actually lack enough smart people to become doctors. But there is a demand in US medical schools for affirmative action.

        A recent, less emotional, example is what happened with Stefan Molyneux, the alt-lite YouTube personality.
Speaking of Molyneux, I was very disappointed by the quality of his recent videoThe Truth About the Pittsburgh Massacre.
It was a trainwreck of false equivalence, anecdote masquerading as data, cherry-picked statistics and dishonest framing. Utterly awful for someone who puts himself forward as an expert on reasoned argument.
And I say that as a fan of Stefan, but I gotta call them like I see them.

        When thinking of the thundering troops of Progressive Cossacks, it seems to be important to separate the passion from the fear.  In the case of relative small fry like Joyent and Hammond I‚Äôd think fear could be the main motivator.  If Gab is Literally Hitler for not censoring Bowers, then Joyent would be Literal Hitler for not deplatforming Gab, and Hammond would be Literal Hitler for not causing Joyent to deplatform Gab.   Nobody with an office in San Francisco could expect to survive as Literal Hitler.Or maybe I‚Äôm giving him too much credit and he‚Äôs just another NPC.The banks are huge but not strongholds of active progressivism, they might be thought of as the Alpine Redoubts of the GOPe.  In their defundings  I‚Äôd also bet that a desire to not be Literal Hitler is paramount over actual beliefs.The ‚Äúno hate speech‚Äù notices on public use copy machines are just standard risk avoidance, like the ‚Äúno copyright protected material‚Äù notices that have been around forever.  Who wants the hassle?  Corporate machines have long been set to digitally store in HR or IT duplicates of all material copied in case a crackdown on abuse is ordered or a leak needs to be tracked but I doubt Kinkos cares.It‚Äôs in Big Tech that you find the passion.  They are bound by no resource or market or even ethical constraints, truly believing themselves to be our mental and moral superiors.  They can buy anyone and indulge any whim.  They will destroy the country rather than risk an uncomfortable question from a young daughter at the dinner table.The merely fearful can be turned.  But, as has been said here, if this is going to be a religious war we‚Äôll all need to strap in‚Ä¶.

        I don‚Äôt really look at gab but I hear you guys talk about it.  What‚Äôs different about gab?  What is the worst of the rhetoric one sees?  They can‚Äôt have actual violent instigation, can they?That said, I think the matter can be reduced to the absurd.  This was not the first anti Semitic spree shooting or attack.  They occur at a rate of about one every decade or so, occurred before the internet age, and show no alarming uptick in frequency.  On the contrary, perhaps they have become less frequent, although I have no real statistical data.  Most of the recent ones have been related to Muslims and the Palestinian question, unsurprisingly, usually close in time to an intifada or whatever.  Internet gabbing is no different from a bunch of guys chatting in a garage or receiving news letters through the mail.  Would you ban these activities due to a spree shooting?  Of course not.So we have this problem of dissident thought being deplatformed by establishment companies.  Why would it be difficult or impossible for some of the altrighters to create their own platform, but your own server?  I am technically ignorant and assume it has something to do with scale.  If you are ideologically driven and not profit driven, you could just offer extremely cut rate prices to attract clients, similar to how amazon sells books at near cost.  A post dealing with the tech aspects and economics of this issue might be useful.  You have no idea how ignorant some of us are!

            It‚Äôs SJWs all the way down. To build a free speech site you need your own hosting, as Gab has made obvious. You could build your own hosting company, but then you‚Äôd be vulnerable to CoLo providers or even the hardware makers. Hardware you can buy secondhand, and you could buy your own real estate (no CoLos) but then you‚Äôd be vulnerable to the big Internet backbone providers. Realistically it‚Äôs impossible to build your own backbone, it would take hundreds of billions of dollars to string fiber optics across the country, and the existing backbones would refuse to peer with you anyway.The bottom line is we need federal legislation that makes deplatforming illegal.

        Looking at how our situation has evolved; the realistic assumption would be that the devolution continues along its current trajectory.  What we are all looking for of course, is the act or actor that employs sufficient force to alter that trajectory.  The usual source for that kind of force is the military (or some portion of it) that decides for whatever reason to act against the ruling class.

        Simple question: since when is the left in love with the Jews? We all know they celebrate alongside Palestinians when their rockets slaughter Jewish toddlers and babies.
Honestly, what would be the difference if this lone wacko was actually taking orders directly from the Ayatollah in Tehran? You know, the ‚Äúdeath to all Jews‚Äù state that Obama forked over a few billion in cash?
The level of hypocrisy is mind boggling.

        I enjoyed reading that Zman. I watch Scott Adams‚Äô periscopes every morning. He pissed me right off attacking Gab and blaming too much unrestricted free speech for thee attack. I had to break up with him for awhile.  Love your podcasts my friend.

            Is it really their product though? The new level of de-platforming goes beyond simply evicting people from web servers. These un-personed sites are being de-platformed at the level of top level domain registries. These are the services that make a domain name like thezman.com have any meaning. They are natural monopolies and should be regulated in the same manner that other public utilities have been regulated. Plus it‚Äôs a bit galling for them to strike this attitude that the Internet is their private turf, when its entire existence is due to enormous public investment over the past 40 some odd years.It‚Äôs even more insidious though when you consider that virtually the entire tech industry is in collusion on this de-platforming. When Alex Jones got de-platformed, there was a clear cascade of synchronized banning of his content from the Apple AppStore to Facebook to YouTube and so on.It‚Äôs really no longer the simple model of ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like it you can take your business elsewhere‚Äù. Consider also, when the shoe is on the other foot they‚Äôve already absolutely said ‚Äúbake the fag wedding cake or else, bigot‚Äù so it would be frankly stupid for us to tie our own hands with private property ideals that the other side already ignores ‚Äî certainly not this far into the match. That‚Äôs the sort of thinking conservatives deluded themselves into for decades, and they got steamrolled by the Left as a result.

        Speaking of Hammond‚Äôs physiognomy, here‚Äôs a video of him being interviewed at an industry convention: . You should watch it. Seems to be a serious and sober tech exec. BSEE from Rochester and MBA from an Wharton.That‚Äôs a lotta cred, though nothing compared to what an autodidact IT guy can muster.

        Z: ‚ÄúAnything that is seen as a challenge to Progressive rule is marked for death.‚Äù  I often ponder the best way to visualize our ruling entity.   An intimidating animal, like a bear, that can think a bit and might not kill you if you do the right things, like stay in your hole and keep quiet.Or an angry animal that actively seeks out intruders to maul, like a  ghetto pitbull.  Or is it some kind of mysterious sea creature like an octopus.  Or a cruel-to-be-kind schoolmarm who really does think order and discipline will fix everything.  Or do we picture it as a pre-programmed machine like the Terminator.  Or a sophisticated philosopher of power like Jonathan Houseman in Rollerball.  Or a giant red lobster simply seeking revenge on white people.

            The trouble is, the oppression isn‚Äôt any one thing. Like light, which can be particles or waves depending on context, it‚Äôs lawfareandmegaphoneandde-platforming switchandinstitutional roadblockandcontrolled oppositionanddozens of other metaphors symbolizing both an irresistible force and an immovable object.
It is perhaps neither irresistible nor immovable. All these modes are connected, and pulling one thread may eventually weaken the whole tent where we are enclosed in darkness. We shall see.

        Dunno. Although it may sound callous, I‚Äôm indifferent to death and suffering. Chalk that up to too much local broadcast news in childhood. But as someone who wants the Trump agenda to succeed (wall, deportations, Muslim ban, trade rebalancing, deregulation, improved economy), this weekend has been a huge and disgusting red pill for me. And I just don‚Äôt see much daylight between the comments section of this blog and Bowers‚Äôs postings in Gab. When Bowers said screw the optics, he knew he could count on you people. None of this is helpful, but you do you.
