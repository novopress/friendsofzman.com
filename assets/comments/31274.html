        Well, I saw today from that uber unquestionable, irrefutable, undeniable and most accurate news source ever, CNN, that Russia has lost 87% of its pre-war active duty ground troops and 2/3 of its pre-war tank inventory.  This comes from a declassified US “intelligence” assessment provided to congress – so there!  Yet, despite these “heavy” losses, Vlad is determined to push forward at all costs and US officials warn that Ukraine remains deeply vulnerable – LOL.  Of course, I’ve seen this  supposed report nowhere else.  The stupidity and hubris these neoclowns and their flunkies is off the charts.  No doubt, Russia’s economy is only days away from imploding as well…

        you may be reading too much into this.  The agreements are in place for arthur daniels midland to purchase  a giant ammount of farmland , and blackrock has the contract to “rebuild”  ukraine. using loans from the world bank of course.  the purpose of the war was to drive the ukrainians from their fertile and resource rich land. As a side benefit, they wanted to get kill off the men and make the women and kids available to traffickers. lots of money in that . well , it’s mission accomplished ,time to wind this down.here is a video of volunteers in ukrain digging up soldiers MIA from WWII to identify and ove them to a ilitary cemetary . look at the huge fields of rich black dirt that as flat for miles . perfect for High automation agriculture .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYgK7KgXjRo

            You think Uncle Vlad is going to let Blackrock take over what’s left of Ukraine when he’s finished. Blackrock is up there with Nato and Azov on his “Terminate with extreme prejudice” list.

        I’ve been saying here for a long time that the GAE has in Ukraine finally picked a fight it can’t walk away from. Whether I’m right or wrong about that, the recent threats by the GAE mouthpieces to congress, about sending America’s sons and daughters to Ukraine if congress doesn’t pony up the money, are certainly one piece of evidence in support of this view.

        The CIA did (another) direct intervention in American politics; they “declassified” “estimates” that Russia has had over 300,000 casualties and lost over 2,000 tanks out of 3,000+, in the Ukraine war, just in time for the showdown on the Ukraine money bill. Implying that money to Ukraine is well spent weakening Russia
Russophobes are running with the numbers of course, forgetting the first law of GAE; it’s always fake and gay.

            Note how they rigged the numbers. “Casualties” can be almost anything from minor to severe injuries to death. The important number is KIA (relative to the Ukrainian KIA number) and I have not yet seen them give a specific figure for that.

                True, and I don’t believe a word of their report. Just the timing of the release is proof CIA has gone totally rogue. They’re not supposed to do ANYTHING domestically. Exactly because their modus is gangster like by necessity. Traitors who grew too big for their boots, like a pet alligator that grew too large and is now out of control

            They have lied about everything of consequence since at least the 1940s, but this time they are telling the truth.   We can take it to the bank.
Since what they report can almost always be completely inverted and you have something close to the truth, then Russia is probably the strongest it has ever been, economically and militarily.

        At the risk of sounding repetitive, I think there are some caveats to thinking we are entering the Ukrainian endgame. I’ve spelled them out in my previous comments on this subject, but there is an additional wrinkle that’s starting to bother me. Whenever speaker Johnson talks about his Ukraine funding gambit, he consistently, repeatedly, explicitly, andemphaticallystates that he believes Ukraine is a righteous cause and that supporting it is the right thing to do. I presume he is smart enough to know how his own words will be taken by others and used against him in the future, so I don’t think he would make public comments like that unless he fully intended to approve Ukraine funding at some point.Furthermore, logrolling southern border protection together with Ukraine funding oversight is not good policy in any case, and does not signify much strength in the leadership. The government has a constitutional obligation to defend the border and no obligation whatsoever to Ukraine. By making this move, Johnson is establishing that border defense is just another chip on the negotiating table, not Congress’ inalienable duty. Border defense should be insisted upon at all times, not negotiated.Finally, the mere fact that Johnson actually believes in the Ukrainian cause signifies that he is on the wrong side of history and doesn’t really understand global problems in the least. It pains me to hear people like Mercouris lauding him for his shrewdness and skilled political maneuvering. I think all the people who thought Johnson was about to return some realism to American foreign policy are going to be shortly disappointed.

        “ The Biden people handed him this gift of trying to tie Ukraine money to Israel money, so he is using this impasse to make pleasant noises about immigration.”Z-man I get where you’re coming from and your use of certain rhetoric to get there.I just have to say for the record and this audience that the influx of border crossers is anything but immigration.  It is an uncontrolled *invasion*!  The pictures show masses of thousands of people rushing the wall/border openings while the BP looks on.  When the openings are closed, as in Lukeville, these invaders bring heavy equipment to breach the walls!  There have been daily “highs” reported of 17k IA’s crossing—and that’s just at formal crossing points.  “Got-aways” are estimated in the thousands as well.Here in the city, BP hired busses, bring these invaders into the city in the middle of the night and dump them—because if seen, they’d be riots.  Congress—any party—are not our friend.This reminds me of the old days where we waited in line for the gates to concerts or the football stadium to open and then we pushed en masse to get in and rush to take the best seats.  Or worse, the final barbarian invasion of declining Rome by the Goths.

                It’s not a story because America is stone-cold dead, that’s why. Every bit as dead as that possum on the side of the road. Dead politically, dead culturally, dead spiritually and dead demographically. The economy continues to jerk along spasmodically, but it too will fall silent in due course.

                    Not to blow unwarranted sunshine all over the place but being on the other side of the pond, the commentariat here reminds me that it is not dead. I’ve never met other commentators in meat space but several of the regulars remind me almost perfectly of people I know stateside. The well-meaning but increasingly angry, formerly solid GOP voter male, over fifty who fought off decades of conditioning to realize that this is not just a bend in the road but historical insanity, is represented several times here. The mid thirties white guy with some college background who’s just fed up with how lame and fake and hysterical everything is, is also common here. The over fifty married woman with grown kids and grandkids on the way who just senses in her bones that disaster is coming and who never understood why men were the enemy. It’s reassuring to be reminded of these types that we’ve all met when out of coastal cities.. No, I don’t think America is dead. I think it is occupied, and being killed. But not dead. In that way this place is a tonic to me

                        “the commentariat here reminds me that it is not dead.”Thanks for the compliment, but none of us control any institutions of power. That’s kind of like saying in 1965 that there was hope for Russia because Solzhenitsyn had written “Cancer Ward.”No, there wasn’t. None of the dissidents really changed anything, the USSR collapsed because the Old Guard communists finally died off and a new generation of insiders, led by Gorbachev, took over. Gorbachev always thought of himself as a true communist, and his predecessors had gotten it wrong.If anything changes in the the U.S.it will not be because of us dissidents, it will be prompted from within The System — i.e., the System might shut down illegal immigration if immigrants start victimizing blacks, Jews, and liberal women, not because immigrants are displacing white men.

                        Who’s running Russia now?? Solzhenitsyn was not a dud. It takes time. But who predicted last year that 2023 would move the JQ more than halfway into Overton?? The vibe has changed. It’s usually the first thing you notice

            Who owns the busses?
First, they came for the newspapers, but I did not object, because I was not a newspaper reader.Then, they came for the television journalists, and I did not object, because I did not watch television news.Now, they are coming for the books and movies, and there is no one left to object, and so I was nullified.

                The busses used to be “Wackenhut”, a private for hire service, owned by a Danish corporation.  I’ve not seen them personally dump IA’s in Tucson, but have seen them pick them up by the border.  They’ve had a contract for literally decades.  I still drive by them when headed out toward the border.True story.  We were working the border early 2000.  We located and had IA’s intercepted.  BP took them as we are not LEO and have no authority.  At the end of a long hot day, we bagged it, disbanded, and drove home.  The nearest place to get a cold drink and some food was the junction turn off to the main highway to Tucson.  There, as usual, was parked a Wackenhut bus (all day with a/c running) to collect the IA’s dumped off by BP..  Sure enough, the group we located, were standing about waiting to board the (Wackenhut) bus back to MX.  In those days, they (IA’s) were offered a chance to sign off for voluntarily deportation or take their chances in front of a judge.   Never heard of anyone declaring refugee status in those days.In short, these folk (IA’s) at that time—were potentially back home *before* we or the BP folk got out of the field and had time to drive home ourselves!

        If anyone caught the 60 Minutes piece on Ukraine Sunday, they were in for a treat. The agenda was so transparent it was actually amusing.  A chubby older man with a mask was claiming Russian soldiers rigged a torture device from a phone and were shocking his genitals for fun.  They rolled out the old script they wrote for John Kerry during Vietnam. Then, he claimed they tied his arms behind his back and pulled them up behind his head so hard his arms almost broke.  As he was talking, he was waiving his hands around, which would have been impossible if that really happened.The masked woman next to him said they poured boiling water on her legs.  My thought was roll up your pant legs and let me see the burns.  I mean, they could have least put her under a sun lamp for a few hours so they could display the “burns”.My point here is not to act outraged by the media lying, but just how ridiculous and over the top this whole acting job was.  The reporter dutifully noted there is an aid bill held up in congress by the Republicans.  He asked one of the fake Ukrainians what he would tell the American people.  He said he would thank them for their support.  It was like a Jerry Lewis telethon, only you could see the kids didn’t really have muscular dystrophy.  Or a televangelist healing someone on TV.  The fakery was so transparent it was funny.

            I’m no commie, but Frederic Jameson’s tenets of modernity come to mind. Here is point 4 of a breakdown by an academic summarizing his work. I have always used this description to explain how people are and experience the world:4) “the waning of affect” (Postmodernism 10) and “a whole new type of emotional ground tone—what I will call ‘intensities’—which can best be grasped by a return to older theories of the sublime” (Postmodernism 6). The general depthlessness and affectlessness of postmodern culture is countered by outrageous claims for extreme moments of intense emotion, which Jameson aligns with schizophrenia and a culture of (drug) addiction. With the loss of historicity, the present is experienced by the schizophrenic subject “with heightened intensity, bearing a mysterious charge of affect” (Postmodernism 28), which can be “described in the negative terms of anxiety and loss of reality, but which one could just as well imagine in the positive terms of euphoria, a high, an intoxicatory or hallucinogenic intensity” (Postmodernism 28-29).

                I’m familiar with the cite, but don’t think it’s needed to go so far as DSM-defining postmodernism in order to get the shape of modern agitprop. It seems that news is just made for women now.

                    But I think there is something special about the dopamine-riddled brains that characterize the modern era, a brain far beyond simple feminine hysterics. I deal with your folk every day; there is something different about them these days. That waning of affect is prescient, for it really describes their flat affect (not a characteristic of traditional women) that only excites when extreme excitement occurs.

        [Reply to RealityRules@https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=31274#comment-381383%5D“The BBC has yet again poked the eyes of Englishmen by portraying Isaac Newton as a negroid.”What about the Germans and Gottfried Leibnitz? Leibnitz had much to do with the development of calculus, arguably the mathematical techniqies most responsible  for Western scientific and technological supremacy.Anyone who wants an introduction or refresher should check out “Quick Calculus”, first written decades ago by a physics professor who needed to raise his students to a minimum level of mathematical competence. The 2nd ed. (which I used) is a crash course in differentiation and integration. Includes also a crash course in prerequisite topics like logarithms, limits, and e (i.e. the limit of (1+1/x)^x as x increases without bound.)It’s not like an ordinary calc textbook, though it does include problems for the reader to solve. Probably you can find the 1st or 2nd ed. on-line and dowloadable for free. Iirc, it uses Leibnitz’s notation exclusively, not Newton’s dot notation.Quick Calculus: A Self-Teaching Guide, 3rd Editionhttps://www.wiley.com/en-us/Quick+Calculus%3A+A+Self+Teaching+Guide%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9781119743194

                    Let’s hope that this sparks the appropriate level of outrage in Germany that it should.In my opinion these thefts of our history and our story are not just scandalous, but they are true outrages that should be wholly condemned by the entire civilization whose eyes they spit in and whose will to assert themselves they test.It is absolutely unacceptable to permit these re-tellings. The entire scientific community at a minimum, should stand up and renounce Netflix. The entire German government should as well and every single Western nation should stand and join in unison. This is shocking and incredible.

        House Republicans suddenly grew a spine for the first time in generations and have refused to give Biden more money for Ukraine without getting significant concessions on immigration.—I know no one else thinks so, but I still suspect that the cupboard getting a little bare is paying into this.  With interest rates dipping slightly the last thing they probably want is trying to stuff another $100+ Billion of addition Treasuries into the already bloated market.  Yeah, that’s probably an optimistic take, but it’s not like they actually have any moral objection to what the money is getting spent on.

        Recent hugely expensive debacles – like Iraq, Afghanistan and Covid – have totally reframed the Ukraine issue in the mind of the public. The huge sums already wasted are mind-boggling, so the public now struggles to put US failures in any kind of useful quantitative/financial perspective. So we’re now like one of those island cultures whose number system is one, two, many…….“Failure” is a binary term anyway. Even “inflation” is quantitatively abstract; people just understand that they have less purchasing power. Inflation is another prominent Regime “failure”.Therefore, the choice for the Regime is either to reframe the Ukraine outcome as a “victory” (tough to do) or to engage in a massive propaganda gaslighting/amnesia campaign and hope the public just forgets. After all, the public isn’t demanding rough justice for the Covid crooks and charlatans, let alone the Afghan debacle. Most people cannot find Ukraine, let alone the Donbass, on a map. The amnesia strategy can probably work.So I think they are going try to put “a lid” on this. The American public will just move on. The Regime will propose and implement more forward deployment of US troops into Poland and Rumania as a trip wire to appease lingering Euro butthurt over this debacle. We will pay to “rebuild” Ukraine to keep graft flowing.It’s going to be hard for Trump or whomever to craft an election issue on this against Biden anyway. Even reasonably smart people I talk to about Ukraine have a hard time understanding the basics, let alone the nuances. Joe Griller or Karen Bluehair just understand that “some bad Russkies invaded our friends and we stood up to them blah blah”. So nobody has an incentive to keep harping on it. I think it will just fade away. That is, if Putin let’s it. He may have the last word here.

        “House Republicans suddenly grew a spine for the first time in generations and have refused to give Biden more money for Ukraine without getting significant concessions on immigration.”That’s one way of looking at it. Another way is that it is a symptom of how dysfunctional our country is.  “The only way we will give you money for the empire is if you actually do something for the American people they desperately want done”In the end, they will cuck. Either they will just write a check while Biden remains steadfast in his opposition to Americans or he will agree to do something about the border and the second the check clears, immediately renege on his promise.

            There’s a neighborhood in London that’s basically a refugee camp for deposed dictators and royal abdicators. Instead of tents, they have mansions. There are similar streets in New York and Miami—presumably in every city where the wives of tyrants want to go shopping. None of those are in Israel. That’s where globohomo retires its nameless henchmen, spies and child molesters. If they don’t decide to sacrifice him on TV, Zelensky will get a full pension and his family will be “in” for generations.

                Before anybody gets too negative on this whole thing, remember that globohomo did educate us and the English-speaking world that Kiev is pronounced “keev.”
This was certainly worth hundreds of billions and who knows how many dead, so what’s the little bit more that’s required to keep Zelensky and his family in a fine mansion and the finest shopping for several generations?  What a deal!

        I saw a clip of Zelensky talking to some people, presumably the MIC people, wearing a t-shirt that said “U K RA N I A N” on it.  How ironic.  I just assumed he was wearing it because he knows deep down inside that he is not and never will be “Ukrainian”
The first think Ukraine needs to do is give him the boot and put an actual Ukrainian in charge of Ukraine.  Imagine a Slav running Israel. It’s just insane.

            Great use of Fitzgerald. Yes, long after the GAE has receded into a deracinated, factionalized and Balkanized central core, it will have left so much carnage and heartache in its wake that guessing the national identity of the latest terrorist attacker will be something of a parlor game.

        I occasionally tune in to the Claremont folks to get a handle on what their discussion points are. On the laughable part, they recently said that The Constitution is still strong enough to govern some long failed/dead aspect of America. I was too busy laughing to remember that aspect. They are very interested in getting a ‘Digital Bill of Rights.’ I think that is about securing American’s ability to acquire the building blocks of AI and robotic technology. Seems very wise. If we can own them, we can build them and stand a chance.The most interesting part is that they regularly and openly talk capitulation in terms of America herself. They openly acknowledge and discuss that America is not behind competitors in some key technologies. They openly acknowledge in subtext that America’s military hegemony is gone. They openly discuss managing our decline to minimize the suffering of millions of Americans.They never discuss the anti-white Regime in explicit or even implicit terms. They never discuss Replacement Migration in those terms either.What does this all mean? Well, I think these guys do take seriously the veneration of Lincoln and the lie of the colorblind society as the new founding’s mythos. I believe, that they reflect a huge part of the old GOP power structure. This makes them irrelevant. The Hamas operation on 10/7 will be seen as the moment where Occidental Man had the opening he needed to begin the reclamation of his homelands.There is only one issue before the entirety of Occidental Man at this time – survival and securing possession of our lands. As we are the ones who understand this, we have it as an advantage. Peter Theil, Blake Masters, Luckey Palmer and that crowd of techno-merchants have proven incapable of mastering the moment. The Regime has no stop button. Netflix just portrayed the white, conservative male attorney who sued the Sackler Empire as a black she-boss. Very mainstream people have openly said they are sick of this garbage. The BBC has yet again poked the eyes of Englishmen by portraying Isaac Newton as a negroid.I believe that a tipping point is being reached where the reality of our situation is dawning on cloud adjacent and even lower cloud white folk. I could be totally wrong, but I get this feeling that the buffoonery of Blake Masters shucking and jiving using, “anti-semitism” as a proxy for attacking, “woke”, is only pissing people off. By people I don’t just mean us dirts, but these cloud adjacent and lower cloud folk too. I think we are reaching a point where it is dawning on enough people that we take up our own cause or it is lost entirely.Our cloud adjacent and cloud folk are extremely competitive, and they are not dumb. Heck, they can pick up the articles complaining about the anti-white issue and see that the entire line of argumentation is that this is going to mean Jews will be dispossessed – no mention of them and their progeny.The mask is off entirely now. America has, for a century, been engaged in tribal warfare unbeknownst to all but a tiny few. Now, there are multiple very large tribes vying for the scraps. The smallest tribe is crying foul and trying to use gentile empathy to defend their position, however all it is is an admission of non-empathy for the position gentiles have allowed themselves to be pushed into. It is crystal clear now.A man who is calm, rational and smart enough will arise as being an explicit advocate for the European peoples who made and who are America. He will do so not by being against the other tribes, but by being for our tribe and using the other tribes’ own endless stream of vitriolic anti-white statements, policies and crimes against us as the case for white advocacy. As important, he will refuse to hide behind racial and ideological proxies. That man will hear a roar of many millions of European descended peoples behind him. Other men will rise to join him. Some will be sincere, some will be opportunists. We will separate the wheat from the chaff.In summary, the acceleration of the demise of the GAE is upon us. There is really only one issue before us, the Men of The Occident – survival, sovereignty and the salvation of our people through the salvation of our homelands. Be prepared to state this calmly and clearly to those close to you without sounding unhinged. I have this feeling that The Regime’s ability to manage the economic ponzi is spiraling out of control as well. If that is true, all bets are off and those conversations with those around you will prove very productive once that happens.Our first, explicit white advocate who knows how to do it and explain it in terms of love for our kind and not hate for another is coming and coming soon. For us, that is all that matters.

                They miss it in part because it pays to miss it. The cost of noticing out loud is extremely high. As for America, it is gone. The project to destroy it has succeeded. Now, the only thing to focus on saving are Americans. We are still here, a nation without a state. Step one is to ensure we have a homeland.The point I was making about the cost of noticing out loud, is that I think we are at or close to the moment where noticing out loud, in the right way, out of love and support for our kind, is going to pay and pay big. Critical for this is that the noticer out loud must not hide behind proxies. He must be white, he must be explicitly pro white, he must be extremely strong and likeable.There are throngs of us who are going to exalt when he arrives. We’ve been forsaken for too long.

            Question, is the inability to plan ahead an indicator of low IQ? Like dogs who just live in the “now”, and when you leave them in the backyard for a weekend, will upset the water bowl and eat every scrap of kibble the first hour you are gone. Reactive to threats rather than proactive to avoid them?

            Your messiahism reminds me of the Kaiserist daydreaming of the shampoo millionare at The “Worthy” House. It’s a species of idolatry which will have something in common also with
JewishEthnosadistWhiteSupremacy.
I doubt very much, though, that your messiahism will have the same staying power. Maybe you  ought to consider the obvious merits of not fantasing about a new and improved Hitler, a Hitler 2.0, a Führer of Liebe for lost, unjewish “white” people.

                This isn’t looking for a messiah or a Fuhrer. As Z has pointed out ad naseum, the Austrian painter is long dead and the framing of the world in 1938 is tired and ready to fall.This is about now. Now that America is nothing more than a bunch of ethnic tribes all of whom have been assembled against the one that doesn’t see itself as a tribe, that tribeless tribe is ready to see itself. It has to or it will not survive the historical entropy of democracy and of a multi-racial/ethnic democracy.It will start with one man who finds the right way, location and time to speak up without hiding behind some protected class and who doesn’t let one protected class hide behind us. He will be met with a welcome that will shock this once country. Then, he will be joined by many others. It won’t be a messiah, it will be a leader and a set of leaders who are primed to deal with the reality of this time.A marker of a Regimist is that it has limited historical knowledge. Christ and Adolf are not proper analogies. Not even close. Besides, the latter is an accusation that is so overused it won’t scare anybody anymore. I’ll leave it to you to figure out who a better analogy would be. Hint, it goes much farther back in time than last century but not as far back as Julius Caesar.

                Nobody ever foresaw that it would be the progressive left purging the tribe from the west. But it looks like once the great boomer die-off, which is only now beginning, has come and gone, the tribe won’t have many friends left here. Certainly very few who are now under 40.

                        To clarify, the progressive Left–including some Jews, BTW–has always been more sympathetic toward all non-whites groups than to Jews. And that sympathy was the motive force behind flooding the West with people who had no sympathy whatsoever toward Jews.

        What blows my mind is that the Vichy Right has been so conditioned to be good little lapdogs that they feel they have to use Uke/Bagel Land foreign war funding as a club to beg Chomo Joe to do the thing he is REQUIRED to do as President, which is to defend the borders and sovereignty of the United States. That’s not negotiable. If They Were Serious (our favorite drinking game over Sev’s joint) The Republicans could bring impeachment for any number of Federal refusals to enforce the international border and the laws of the United States but, of course, Vichy by definition isn’t Serious, nor is the governor of Texas, who could mobilize the military force he legally has for real, not show, to end border violations. He isn’t Serious either.If the House were Serious, they’d make a big deal of introducing modern versions of the 1935-1937 Neutrality Acts and the Ludlow Amendment, and milk them for all it is worth. The provisions of that old legislation included a hardcore version, but even the soft version of 1937 would create a storm in AINO’s capital and the Fistagon, as well as Lockheed and Rayethon.1. Imposing a general embargo on trading in arms and war materials with all parties in a war. It also declared that American citizens traveling on warring ships traveled at their own risk.2. The President could permit the sale of materials and supplies to belligerents as long as the recipients arranged for the transport and paid immediately with cash.

            All good points and suggestions, but the fact remains that many if not most Republicans want open borders and endless wars, too. The only constituents who matter to the GOP lawmakers, the donors, insist the red and green flow year ’round.But, yeah, this situation is the equivalent of promising to donate millions to Catholic Charities if your parish priest will hear your confession. Abdication of border enforcement, the primary requirement of a nation-state, renders the central government (and the Texas counterpart, as you point out) illegitimate and able to maintain itself only through raw and brutal force–which is how the Regime controls the masses now.

            Pickle rick:  Good points all, but bonus points for stating that Abbott is not serious.  His border theater goes back many years – my son spent 6 months there about 9 years ago and was never allowed a magazine for his weapon.Per official statistics, Texas had a non-hispanic White population of 39.3% in 2021.  Factor into that the ‘fellow Whites,’ Persians, various ‘wheatish’ subcons and whitish south Americans (all of whom check the “White” box on the official papers), and in 2023 you’d be lucky to have 35% – a growing percentage of whom are those famed California cuckservatards.Sorry to indulge in one of my favorite hobby horses, but every time I see a comment anywhere extolling Abbot I want to hurl.  Heritage Texas is as much a reality as White-run ‘murica.  Elementary schools in DFW, per Schooldigger, went from 83% White and 9.8% Asian in 1997 to 17% White and 62.7% Asian in 2023.  Another one (in a wealthier part of the suburb we used to live in) went from 88.3% White in 1997 to 36.9% White, 11.8% black, 30.6% Asian, and 15.3% Hispanic in 2023.  The high school we let our older son attend so he could join Jrotc went from 82.2% White to 25.8% White.But I still see “God bless Texas.”  Bah, humbug.

        The best Ukrainian military strategy at this point is to retreat to the most defensible positions that they can find, create a mobile reserve and prepare to give ground when necessary.The best Ukrainian diplomatic strategy would be to ask China to mediate negotiations between Ukraine, Russia and the United States.  Russia cannot refuse a Chinese request for the opening of negotiations in which China will serve as a mediator.  But even talented Chinese diplomats probably cannot find a solution to the conflict unless and until either the Russians simply occupy Ukraine as the Ukrainian military collapses, or the United States agrees to Russian demands to avoid the first scenario.And I agree with the commentators above who see almost demonic evil in some of the persons pushing the Ukraine war in the West.

            Why in God’s name would China agree to this? China has no interest whatsoever in seeing the war in Ukraine end. It is an albatross around the neck of the US, it is driving a wedge between the US and Europe, and it is forcing Russia to lean into China as an ally.
This war is a Godsend for China. I doubt anyone in the Kagan cult thought through this carefully.

                Evidently the Chinese don’t agree.  Last February the Chinese government proposed a peace plan for Ukraine. It was admittedly short on details, and would have to be adjusted in light of developments since then, but it could serve as the basis for negotiations with China as mediator.  China opposes most anything that interferes with business and the prestige that would accrue to China in the Global South if it could successfully mediate an end to the Ukraine war would be enormous;

                    Right, but China didn’t follow through on anything, or make even a feeble attempt to flesh out details. Sounds more like virtue signaling to me.

        “Zelensky’s palace could soon be the closing scenes of the movie Scarface.”
You said it! In footage not screened on mainstream media, Zelensky is a trembling, agitated cocaine addict. No doubt the CIA are supplying him with their best Colombian marching powder. One way to keep a hold over him. There was a recent meeting with Sunak and Z just looked completely out of his box, gurning ferociously.
Emanual “Manny Man-lover” Macron is another famous politican with a nose like a Dyson.

            &gt; No doubt the CIA are supplying him with their best Colombian marching powder. One way to keep a hold over him.This! While many seem to think the world rulers are kept in line due to the blackmail of sensational satanic pedo abuses, cocaine is and has always been a much more reliable method of control.The two female former PMs of Finland and New Zealand, Boris “Fat Bastard” Johnson — pretty much all of the “elected” leaders of the West are coke-rattled junkies. The World Economic Forum really ought to rebrand as the World Cocaine Forum. It would be more accurate.

        We need to step outside ourselves and look at this as objectively and dispassionately as we can. The original plan was for Russia to fold like a cheap tent. Then they’d stand idly by in defeat while Gobohomo Inc and the international jewry raided their finances and resources. That plan has since fallen apart, and there are no contingency plans. We can’t guess what our leaders will do because they have no idea themselves. I see no reason for them to do anything other than what they have been: funnelling billions of your dollars into that pit while taking the biggest cut for themselves as they can in the process.Given the idiocy in Washington I suspect the situation will sort itself out. Zelenskyy will disappear one night with his closest people. They’ll go to their villas in foreign countries or into a shallow grave. The people that take control of the Kraine will cut ties with Washington and negotiate on their own behalf directly with Moscow. And all those billions of dollars in weapons and war materiel…will be left for the Russians.By then we will probably be at war with China over Taiwan, so it won’t be of any consequence. The Current Thing is all that matters. 😂👍

                        Just go to an airport and see them waltzing around the terminals amongst hood rats on their cell phones openly bragging about being acquitted for their crimes. The American airport is not the Star Wars bar. It wouldn’t be far fetched to predict that some Latinx or Arabic gangster is using the port to smuggle contraband and sell off used aircraft at loan shark rates within 20 years. The first part is probably already happening. It is definitely happening in Detroit with theft and in Chicago with Saudi owned traffic violation fine harvesting equipment.I could see a flight being cancelled, the passengers disembarked and then watching from the gate window while some gangsters waltz by to embark while their personal loading crew put loads of coke and heroin on conveyor belts. Then they fly off to Oklahoma City to fill the distribution centers that will supply the heartland. I hate the thought of it, but it seems a likely I told you so coming to our future. I bet that is the purpose of all those new embassies the Republican OK governor has been opening.The optics on-shore are already far worse.

            Meh. They are going to be blamed for pretty much everything anyway. Some California biddy on a viral TikTok vid was ranting about Republicans being the reason it took $72 to fill her gas tank. And “82 million voters” are going to be manufactured in order to punish Republicans for it.

            Nope. Saw this movie before, with Obama’s Syria red line a little over a decade ago, and all the humiliation was on the side of their antagonist (who is probably running the Ukrainian current thing behind the scenes). Has the GOP been blamed for Syria’s or Afghanistan’s collapse? Has any griller anywhere even partially blamed the GOP for the Floyd-Covid riots, unconstitutional lockdowns, or immigrant tent cities in Chicago/NYC? To ask the question is to answer it. Most elected Republicans treat foreign wars purely as a patronage instrument for MIC. Look at their holy-whore candidate from South Carolina who somehow gets a pass on politically correct gestures that would be fatal to a GOP candidate circa 2004.

        I was intrigued by your lead sentence, Zman. There is, of course, a long-established Father of Lies—acknowledged as such by Jesus. Do you mean to say that our rulers are explicitly devoted to this Father of Lies, and doing his bidding? That the regime has taken on a genuinely diabolic character?
Full disclosure: I consider it quite plausible that this is indeed the case.
I should add that this is a sincere question to you. It seems to me your columns and audio programs have taken a more religious turn lately (more precisely, a Christian turn).

            I was an atheist my whole life, but what I have witnessed over the past several years can only be described as demonic. My eyes are wide open and I see demons all around us.
One thing I am sure of is that these demons can not be fought with love and tolerance. Things will keep getting worse until we put a decisive stop to this.

                I have a very similar take. The evil is palpable. This phenomenon has been described many times throughout history, with Dostoevsky’s DEVILS the best account. As my life enters its final reel I remain skeptical that God exists but have become quite convinced that evil is real. That’s not very comforting.
The transition from estrogen-drenched NPC’s banning Tchaikovsky to the homosexual senator Graham sporting a woody as he described mass slaughter is sobering but represents the zeitgeist perfectly.

                    Good that you mentioned The Devils, Jack. Communism and socialism were just kicking off back then, so it’s pretty incredible how Dostoevsky nailed the Left-wing psychopathic personality to a tee.

                    Well, Hobbes was a strict materialist, but he still believed in God (matter in motion). In practice yes, except that I do believe that atheism leads to materialism.Anyone see that Etsy stuff with the pizza, kids, and one eyed sign? That Abramovic or whatever woman (the one who does the spirit dinners) being made a Ukraine ambassador? And all the images in pop culture of Satanism? Our overlords clearly worship Satan.Whether he really exists is another issue, but their belief is undoubtable.Check out Vigilant Citizen’s website. I have plugged him a few times (no way affiliated), but if you need a gateway into the seedy imagery of our society and its embrace of Satanism, look no further.

                And the worst is Gaza.   You can sort out the Christians of good intent by their position on this.   I have heard several so called Christians say that “There are no innocents in Gaza.”

                    Haven’t encountered any of those, personally. The closest to it are those who point out that there have been no magic bullets since November 22, 1963, so it’s unlikely that anyone can shoot around a human shield.
I do suspect that there are no innocent adult Palestinians in Gaza, though. An adult who chooses to be a human shield has made a choice. And an adult to makes his own kids into human shields has, too.

Me personally? I took my family away from the Twin Cities when they started the Little Mogadishu Project at Cedar and Riverside. I wasn’t going to subject my family to the often lethal insanity that DFL represents.
As one person, I can’t really stop the collapse. But I can show enough love for my family to get them the heck out the blast radius.

            “More than half a century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: Men have forgotten God; that’s why all this has happened.Since then I have spent well-nigh fifty years working on the history of our Revolution; in the process I have read hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous Revolution that swallowed up some sixty million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: Men have forgotten God; that’s why all this has happened.What is more, the events of the Russian Revolution can only be understood now, at the end of the century, against the background of what has since occurred in the rest of the world. What emerges here is a process of universal significance. And if I were called upon to identify briefly the principal trait of the entire twentieth century, here too, I would be unable to find anything more precise and pithy than to repeat once again: Men have forgotten God.The failings of human consciousness, deprived of its divine dimension, have been a determining factor in all the major crimes of this century.”Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

        Dunno. The Ukraine grift is quite lucrative. The Ho’s and the Help in the Imperial City have sucked the Keeeevvvveeee teat for a long, long time and the withdrawal will be a bitch. The Kagan Cult has been noticed after its decades-long campaign of mass murder and genocide against the goyim. I don’t see these monstrous, greedy clowns letting this one go unless the optics of yet another crime against humanity framed as a failed war is a bit too much to bear in an election year. I do agree that when uber whore Baier is allowed to ask actual questions it may indicate the plug is about to be pulled, but, again, dunno.The Gay Old  Pedophiles, who admittedly are incredibly stupid thieves, are trying the kabuki of Potemkin border enforcement in exchange for more “Ukraine” lucre. “Give Ukraine (Raytheon/me a little) money and we just might slow down the invasion of the United States” may not be playing well in Peoria but they would be the last ones to know. Republican voters (all voters, really) mostly are retarded but even retardation has its limits. On the other hand, what the electorate thinks and wants no longer matters in the now-rotting Banana Empire.The Regime has caused the murder of hundreds of thousands of Slavs and profited mightily. I remain skeptical it can just let all that go, but pray for peace and Uncle Lloyd’s ol’ marse Ray-fee-on getting the sweats.

        I wouldn’t be surprised to see Zaluzhnyi put in charge. He wants to pull back the troops and run a defensive war. That would work for dragging out this affair past the election without a major collapse. Most Americans don’t care about the war so a strategic withdrawal wouldn’t be noticed, especially if the media just doesn’t report on it.
But who knows. The real question is why the Ukrainian people continue to support the war. I realize that they hate the Russians, but they’re destroying their country.

            People forget, but Covid insanity ran in the press right up until the Ukraine war started.  When it happened it was like a switch had been flipped and they went from all Covid to all Ukraine in a matter of hours.  I thought they might take advantage of the Israel-Hamas conflict to push Ukraine out of the way and wrap it up, but there are too many people invested in the cash flow.

                The cash will keep flowing after the war. Someone has to rebuild Ukraine. The country will still have a fair amount of natural resources. It’ll Russia in the 1990s all over again. The usual suspects will buy up everything cheap and US taxpayers will funnel cash into those “Ukrainian” companies to rebuild what’s left.
The MIC will need to restock our military’s shelves along with all those new orders from Europe.
The key however is that DC can’t let Ukraine be run by a Russia-friendly govt.

                    The parts that will have to be rebuilt largely will be under Russian control and I don’t see Putin allowing any Western-linked contractors near there. If this madness continues, and it may, a primary objective will be to let Blackrock and Co. share in that blood-drenched grift of rebuilding.

                    Instead of a new homeland, just a pirate’s den not subject to EU regulations.
The finest whores, child trafficking, organ harvesting, weapons testing, GMOs, biochem labs- and a money laundry that makes the Caribbean look like a shabby pawnshop.

            “He wants to pull back the troops and run a defensive war.”
It’s long past time being too late for that. The pace of Russian advance is set by Russian strategic objectives, not Ukie resistance. The RF still has an enormous pool of men sitting on the sidelines in reserve, extremely well equipped for and well trained in the new way of war, and battle hardened after rotations at the front. Ukraine’s death throes are being dragged out so that the coup de gras has maximum political effect on the real enemy.

        Other than the Ukrainians themselves, the real losers here will be Europe. The only thing keeping the EU afloat was German industrial production and they threw it away the second they were told to by the Biden admin.
It’s amazing how few “grown ups” actually exist in the western world. Everyone is constantly looking to someone else for guidance, whether that be the Americans in the case of Europe or the media in the case of the Americans. Everything revolves around “perception”, nobody cares about the actual reality on the ground.
The map is not the territory.

                Things They were hoping for: to regime change Putin, introduce degeneracy, break up The Russian Federation, gobble it piece by piece.   I think it went wrong when Trump got elected, thus giving Russia several extra years to prep.  Had the pranksters been successful it would have opened up a great amount of collateral to keep the ponzi going.
And it seems like they don’t really plan, just tip over the apple cart and try to grab apples or the cart or steal whatever during the confusion.

        “This sounds a bit farfetched”Perfectly plausible and not farfetched at all. We are now at the stage of recriminations. Senators like Vance and Tuberville have come out and said they never really believed in this half-assed venture anyway. Probably others will come out and say the same thing in the weeks and months to come. The administration will be flailing desperately for some scapegoat to blame. As you pointed out a week back, defeat is an orphan. Even the neo-cons will be busy disassociating themselves from this debacle. To paraphrase Shakespeare, “When I said engage in the proxy war with Russia, I said twas pity.” That will become the common refrain. This will become an embarrassment to be flushed down the memory hole with alacrity.On the international stage the US continues to lose clout, respect, credibility, and influence. This latest fiasco is but another nail in the coffin of US hegemony.

            Agreed – this is near fetched (or whatever the opposite of far fetched is).  The admin being able to claim the failure was due to Republican meanies cutting off funding which resulted in a coup and then collapse – is a pretty good excuse / off ramp.At this point I suspect even Mr. “Best money we ever spent” Graham may be rethinking his…position.
