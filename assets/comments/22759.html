        One bummer about growing up among working class baby boomers, as I did, is that they had a work ethic that revolved around manly virtues and physical labor.  Not knowing how to use a the right wrench for a given task made you a complete loser of low status.  The butt of jokes.Having grown up in that world I naturally adopted that sort of masculinity and have always tried to be “productive”.The kids these days are really the exact opposite.  Honestly, I feel ripped off.  I really don’t like the fact that I have paid probably at least half a million dollars in taxes to the federal government in my life whereas a bunch of illegal immigrants and young people who have no intention of ever doing real work get freebies galore for nothing basically.I mention all of that because it made me groan to read that a man is a “social media manager”.  That is a girl’s vanity job at best.  What is wrong with this world?

            Agree.I was not unhappy to see my teenage son disassemble a spare little Honda engine we had lying around (we all have one of those, don’t we?) purely to see how it works.His reassembly skills, we both agree, need work.

                    I did that to a friend. When we were  playing with our first cars – early 70’s, he took apart his engine and carefully kept all the parts neatly separated from the rest of the junk on his bench. I dropped a couple of extra nuts and bolts in the mix which drove him made trying to figure out what he’s missed.Told him after a few hours.

                My neighbor’s son does dirt track racing in a car with a Honda engine. I was talking to his Dad and he mentioned that one thing that everyone who knew Honda engines agreed: youneverdisassemble the bottom of a Honda engine. The tolerances are so tight you will never get it back together properly, and they are designed so well that they probably won’t need the bottom touched for the life of the engine.

                Yes, but those failures eventually turn into successful repairs.  At least that was my experience as a youngster.
I used to grab a lot of attention at committee meetings—committees being notorious for not doing anything except talking and analyzing—when I’d state, “anything worth doing is worth failing at”.

                A good friend, whose dad installed the wiring in the Apollo lunar landing module, got an old engine at 13 and spent 3 years fooling around with it in the garage. He became a champion outlaw street racer before he was out of high school.At 16, his parents emancipated him so he and his buddies could drive their motorcycles all over the country to compete in major meets. They’d get day labor to buy gas. A cop asked him if he had a gun in his backpack- he said yes- the cop said “good, you never know if you might need it.”This was in the 60s, when 14 year-olds routinely drove cattle trucks to the stockyards in another state. Education, in school and in life, was to raise adults, not children.

            Shitting on the kids these days is like shooting fish in a bucket. But… if your kids can’t disassemble an engine, and you think it is a valuable life skill… whose fault is that, really?My old man was a master mechanic and worked on everything from jet engines on down. If we kids touched his tools, we got shot. If we tore down a spare engine just for fun, we got shot.Nowadays engines are so modular and there are so many microprocessors and proprietary tools needed to work on them, that if you dig into one for giggles…you are in for a major education in finance.Our esteemed blog host calls out the chattering skulls in the media; if we shot every last one of them we’d have only started the clean up. Our kids are at the mercy of the most empty headed ding bats running the public schools. If you have kids and are sending them to public schools you are doing them a grave disservice that they (and you) will pay for for the rest of your lives.

                My kids go to public schools, but they get such a heavy dose of counter-programming, that it actually benefits them to see the manipulation in the system.  They got a dose of diversity through some inner city bussing into their white suburban school.  They could see how disruptive the black kids are, and how they can get away with anything due to the fear of RACISM.  That is a valuable lesson they never would have received otherwise.

            Everyone who doesn’t have student loan debt should be apoplectic with rage regarding the proposed jubilees.

It’s a mulligan for enormously stupid life choices and a transparent ploy to buy off two, maybe three generations of that voting bloc.

And the productive, taxpaying American gets to pay for all of it.

                I agree we need to completely rethink the student loan program, but who is to blame, really?You give an 18 yo person with no life experience 10’s of thousands of dollars to attend college and major in whatever bullshit area they choose and then expect they’ll pay off the “loan” with a mediocre or even minimum wage job?There’s also a similar problem with for-profit schools that attempt to teach a trade of sorts.  However, for a number of years now, these schools have been under scrutiny by the Fed’s for their “graduates” not obtaining employment—or even graduating.  In some cases, their students’ ability to receive loans has been curtailed.  But not-for-profit colleges receive no such scrutiny.

                    I agree with Compsci, either way, somebody has been or will be hosed.I’d write it off and curse my luck.  It’s like blowing a commercial engine, the equipment looks the same and generates the same income as last month, except you’re $25,000 short.The inflation from college costs has already seeped into all other living costs- housing, payroll, health care, business insurance.  I’d welcome deflation across the board.Under Industrial Capitalism, America provided low-cost education, not student debt. It provided basic infrastructure at low cost.  Employers could pay lower wages without the hidden, extortionate, inflationary effect of “benefits” or degrees.Our banks created money through public banks to create capital, to create the means of production.The objective in collateral-based banking was to make a profit and interest, not to make capital gains and speculation. This created money to fund actual means of production to build factories, to build research and development, to build transportation facilities, to build infrastructure.Under Finance Capitalism, rentiers and managerial services dominate. The people who don’t make things, everybody dipping their bucket in the same dwindling river of social costs, some real, some imagined.

                Nobody is going to “pay” for it.  The treasury will “borrow” the required funds from the federal reserve which creates it with a few keystrokes.  Based upon current projections, the federal debt will be roughly 200% of gdp in four years and 300% in eight years.  Does anyone think this will ever be “repaid”?

                    One way or another all debt is “repaid”.  I usually simply assume when someone says “repay” they are just pleading for a policy that will not inevitably make the dollar worthless through inflation.

                I was tied down for a decade because of my student loans, but that was because I hastily chose a major. (Mortuary Science – I was raised on horror films.) Nobody bailed me out, and I don’t want my tax dollars bailing out unkempt, purple-haired Gender Studies indoctrinees either.

                    I understand, Maniac, but we’ve got to deflate the “worth” of those degrees.
They’re all ‘political science’ degrees, necessary to becoming a comissar in the System.  That’s part and parcel of why the System pays so well.

                Is it a default, or a payoff and bailout of the managerial class?

Now the big heads are talking about a rollout of a singular, global digital “currency”. Governmental and managerial ‘debt’ are about to become moot, that’s why the debt and deficits don’t matter. They’re just tools to get the emergent Owner class where they want to be.

The Jubilee will be for the Too Big To Fail.  Lockdowns for us.

                    And Trump has to know this as well.  Yet he walked away from an obviously fraudulent “selection” result, leaving his supporters and former country completely at the mercy of the merciless left.  For me, that’s the bitterest pill to swallow.  Why he didn’t fight it out tooth and nail…  Just didn’t have it in him apparently  – a yuge enough pair.

            The world is increasingly virtual. A simulacrum run online.
The real physical world is the foundation that the simulacrum sits upon. An ever decreasing fraction of the whole. However, the real world can and did exist without the simulacrum. But the latter cannot exist without the former.
So for how much longer will the latter be dominate and why? At some point soon the dirt people that keep everything running should be able to command a premium. Their essential skills require intelligence and experience to accumulate. The virtual worlds’ not so much.

I have often said you could bring this place to its knees rapidly by simply being clever enough to get all Truckers into a collective bargaining arrangement and strike. It would be difficult to call in a bunch of scabs because driving a fully loaded semi is not a trivial skill.

                    A truck strike will only happen if the big dogs, the corporate upper class, coordinate it- or if the thousands of small Diverse companies decide they’re in the same boat as White Americans.Not to rain on the parade, but a French style truck strike faces heavy headwinds here. We’re no longer the organized industry of union teamsters we used to be.We’re as corporate as farming now. Diversity hiring has major impetus in our industry. It’s semi-skilled training and a decent wage, quick, and there are few jobs left anymore. Anybody can buy a truck and get under a corporate umbrella, in business fast. Some Uzbek or Czech will take the brokered load cheaper and scab.As a trucker, I remember a couple abortive national strikes in the early 90s. Nobody knew what they were for, nothing much happened beyond a few nail strips in the road and a bunch of chatter on the CB.That’s back when we were all Americans, and the CB chatter never stopped, 24/7, anywhere in the country.Now, we’re heavily diversified, corporatized, tracked, and GPS’d. The CB and its chatter are a relic.Sikhs dominate your food supply from CA, some Somalis in the north, blacks in the south, immigrants in the cities, and Mexicans in the southwest. Amazon is aiming to become the Walmart of distribution, and they hire small Nu-Americans far more readily than large or trad union companies.What happened to Americans? We got old, went local, or got into administrative ‘logistics’ or compliance services. Meanwhile, the Mexicans focused on mechanics and equipment repair, and in-state. The immigrants, recently unemployed, or unskilled/uneducated dimwits (me) do the distance grudge work.I don’t know what will herd these cats. Also, National Guard could drive the delivery trucks. The feds could waive CDL, commercial driver license, requirements, that’s a perquisite of being a fed. They’d probably offer national emergency contracts to Walmart, Amazon, and the Big Five instead.Now on the bright side, whenever storms cause a power outage on the East Coast, you have electric company contractors flooding in from Texas, Georgia, and Kansas. That alone proves that quick, decisive physical action can be taken on a large scale…so delivery strikes and roadblock shutdowns are not out of the question.We’ve talked before of, “what if a hundred trucks decided to break down on every major road into D.C.?” That would throw some enticing sand in the gears. Ain’t enough cops or cop cars. And if the airline unions joined us…And electrician’s unions, and telephony unions…

            Yes, things really are that bad, but the proper response is not despair or resignation. Rather, it’s a call to roll up your sleeves and get to work on a solution. That is, more or less, what our forefathers did in the 1770s. It does no good to continually catalog &amp; criticize all the ways in which things are going wrong. That part is blindingly obvious. The hard work lies in finding &amp; implementing effective solutions. And some of these solutions are serious business, so you will need both cojones.

                    The Soviet citizenry did that and it took 80 years and about 100 million dead, so not really all that optimum. We can do better (meaning faster) and avoid the genocide part. Some will contribute more passively by sucking the Fed dry or withholding their labor, but others will be more proactive by throwing sand in the gears. Either way, the collapse is the cure.

            While my husband is a smart and capable man, his past work at blue-collar jobs with blue collar friends (until he decided to finish college and got a govt job) made me respect him far more than if he had been a typical middle class midwit.  He’ll never be a Mr. Fixit around the house (I’m more likely to try to tackle some small things and he takes over in exasperation at my ignorance)  but he’s done his share of manual labor.  I value that.

            What Z said holds true for me tooThey take pride in their not knowing how to do anything useful.  I know so many college men like that.  But they never caught on to the fact that women LIKE guys who know what they are doing.  You would think if for no other reason they would learn something to make themselves attractive.  And you do not have to go too far back when the upper crust of society was filled with men who knew how to do practical things outside of their law or medical careers, etc.  Today’s educated are just rubes with ornamented credentials, like when Oz hung a diploma around the scarecrow’s neck.

        The only time I ever hear about the propaganda harpies is second-hand via blogs like this and a few other internet sites. Consequently, I am mostly oblivious to the noise, but this post does reveal a much more serious and fundamental problem in our society. With each passing generation, we create and carry more &amp; more deadweight. I call it societal obesity, and it’s becoming morbid, and it will kill us eventually.

        The media has become a fun house mirror, or perhaps, a gaslight game grown really monstrous. I’ve found it’s best to remove yourself from it. Don’t be an angry, critical participant. Just don’t participate. I’ve cut off from any mass news, sitcoms, etc., anything new. Watched old documentaries on streaming and when those ran out, subscribed to great courses and watched medieval history…Just finished 36 episodes on the Ottoman Empire and it was an eye opener.Last night I watched an episode of how it’s made…all the commercials featured, without exception, black people and women, usually together. The only white guy I saw was an older guy complaining about losing his hair. Then between the commercials was the show, featuring craftsmen and techs making glass, ladders, other tools. Everyone was without exception a white guy…We need to separate.

        I was born in the late 50’s and was old enough to remember 1968. At least from my observations of my life somewhere around 1968 we began to glorify the bohemian lifestyle, the Beatles took on the degenerate drug and free sex infested California lifestyle, Sargent Pepper Album was produced…and that Bohemianism worked, but only if it was not widespread, Berkeley and Hait Ashbury could not be our entire national values.Well guess what? Now all our kids go to Berkeley, K through 12, and we wonder why they are dumb asses and have no idea about real history?Couple stupid people with a highly automated computer driven world and we have a dystopian future before us.Unless we find a way out?I think there is a way out but not in the republic as it currently exists.

            George Harrison went to Haight-Ashbury during the summer of 1967 and was very vocal about how disgusting he found it.  Expecting to find a communal utopia of peaceful artisans, he found out it was mostly filthy, drugged up, vagabonds.  At least he had the good sense to immediately and publicly call it out for what it was.  Today’s media-entertainment types would have kept looking for the one avatar of their preconceptions to promote.

                Ole George then went off to India and chanted to himself. George might have recognized the hippie culture was corrosive but he played in the shit pile with them. I kinda see Eric Clapton the same way. Clapton was or is pretty red pilled on race judging from his past statements but he makes a good coin with the Bohemians and he loved their drugs which should have killed him.Much of the  cool rock and roll we got down through the years, and I love some of it myself, came from black degenerates and bohemian hippies financed by the usual suspects record companies.The music can be cool but we also got drugs and degeneracy with it.But we partied on.Now we got a hang over.Payback is a bitch.

                George Harrison’s  experience reminds me of the commune scene in Easy Rider where the stoned would-be hippie farmers wander across the parched earth, scattering seed. Dennis Hopper’s character “Billy” asks dumbfoundedly “Uh, get any rain here?”  Even as a kid when I first saw the movie I thought – what a bunch of dumb asses.

            What happened in the fifties, culminating in 1968, was that Jews’ conniving powers were radically augmented by television. They found out that they could make people think pretty much whatever they wanted, if they just repeated the message loudly and often enough.
So they swooped down on the most corrosive subculture in the US, the drug-up-and-drop-out-crowd and decided to make them cultural heroes; giving them record contracts, publishing their books, putting them on mainstream television.
The hippies in 1968 were no different from the SJWs of today: useful idiots for our hateful overlords, promoted and financed by the elites.

                    I would’ve disagreed with Dino on this, giving people the benefit of the doubt, but I just spent a month with my anti-Trump bestie.


He watches CNN all the time, and shakes with visceral rage at “the desecration by the insurrectionists.” It’s an overwhelming physical reaction with him.


I felt chills going down my spine reading the linked First Things article. They didn’t have the boob tube, smart phones, or pharmacochemical pollution, yet the intelligentsia still were consumed with that strange zeitgeist.

                        My brother is the same way.  A very intelligent former engineer.  He was in the Air Force during Vietnam.  Hates the commies with a passion and has argued for decades that Franco was a good guy that ran Spain well.
Stuck at home watching TV for the last half decade he’s convinced that Trump is a neo-Nazi devil and that COVID is the Black Death.
Its depressing to see the propaganda work on him.

        Honest to God, I believe most people aren’t real. The majority of human beings are NPCs that repeat programmed phrases. Whether it be repeating political arguments when they hear certain words regardless of the context. Or even if they were lamenting it was false not a week before.

And it isn’t just politics, they repeat the same stories and points if you listen to them long enough.

            Kind of like the old High School debate club?I gave that a try, once, a long time ago.I quickly realized everyone was just repeating what they heard on the TV news or had read in the op-ed column of the local paper, and found it all very boring.

            there is a glut of humanity, no doubt
To the point where the individual has little intrinsic value.  If he gets clobbered over the head, no worries, many more where he came from.
I think many of our problems are here because there are simply too many humans.  How can you have a functioning, moral society when humanity is cheap and easily replaceable?

        A bit of insight.Even at its best, which was rare, information dispensers relied heavily on general beat reporters. The guy who filed stories on the city council was expected to write analysis of the fashion industry. Yes, there were desk reporters who covered niche areas, particularly at large outlets such as broadcast networks, but even at the infornation age’s height those were few and far between. The niche folks are all but gone now and the few large outlets left now expect even the science reporter to offer insight into the Federal Reserve. So unfiltered press releases, more often than not, along with media people’s blatherings in their social circles, form the basis for what is transmitted.So the descent into rank propaganda was an easy one because at best those disseminating disinformation really don’t realize it, and in most cases consider distortion part of their jobs.

            The professionalization of the media has brought us to this point for sure. Fifty years ago the typical reporter was a state college graduate. Their bosses were high school grads. Today, they come from elite colleges with advanced degrees in managerial calligraphy. These are highly confident people with heads full of nonsense. On top of it is the fact they are high in social skills, but low in general intelligence and experience.

                I wouldn’t say “professionalization” of the media so much as “credentialization.” The old media used to be a lot more professional. If I am correct there was a time when it was possible to be a professional “reporter” without a college degree.One of the things that I have noticed, however, is the “twatification” of the media. Today, they put idiotic 23-year-old girls straight out of college on television who basically act like children and report gossip. One “reporter” for a local station was doing a segment on gyms being closed due to COVID, and actually went on camera jumping up and down on a trampoline like a fucking four-year-old child.The “gossipy-chick-as-journalist,” reporting unfounded rumor and innuendo, has become standard fare for even network news broadcasts, and characterized nearly all of the coverage of the Trump presidency.I grew up in the age of John Chancellor and and David Brinkley, when journalists were sober and dignified and made damn sure they had their facts straight before they went on the air.The contrast with today’s “journalists” is shocking.

                    And good looks are certainly a sizable part of the equation – as well as being able to read their cue cards (or whatever) competently.  Years ago, one of our local news stations had a nice looking bimbo, either anchor or weather, who was always stumbling over her reporting.  She lasted a while because of her looks, but eventually her lack of speaking skills did her in.  Looks and being able blab the latest propaganda while looking ever so serious are about the only requirements these days.

                    Today it is beyond just not having their facts straight.  It is that they make up the facts they report.  I suspect most confidential sources are just made up, or some low level insider who they present as high-level, and the reporter and source are colluding on the propaganda.  If I do not hear a source saying something with my own ears, I assume the quotes are fake.

                There really wasn’t ever a golden age of accurate unbiased news media. They’ve always been a combination of entertainers and propagandists.  They just had better PR from roughly 1950-1980 to convince people that they were informative and unbiased.Even so, the rise of “journalism”  academically made the situation much worse.   In olden days (before 1970 or so) the reason given by reporters for getting into the news bizwas an unquenchable curiosity for what, who, where and why.Since then people getting into journalism report doing so because.They want to change the world.That is fundamentally incompatible with even the pretense of objectivity

Yes. The entertainment industry made movies and tv shows about the sainted journalist standing up to power. And then coincidentally the journalist wrote glowingly about celebrities and their selfless work for whatever. That’s the greatest collusion of the 20th century

                        Thanks for clearing up my confusion.  I guess ‘NPR’ actually stands for ‘National Propoganda Radio.’  Trump should have fired all the leftists and set up a gold standard, high-quality ‘NEWS’ station for us unwashed just to demonstrate how it’s done.

                In no small way the actual ‘Deep State’ agent Woodward bought us to the Elite Class reporter.I mean exactly that Woodward was clearly an Agent of Influence.50 years ago reporter was a working class step up temporary job, on the way to becoming a teacher, or perhaps small newspaper/radio/TV station small businessman.Woodward CV: Naval Officer, Communications [Signals].Nuclear Cleared.  Aide to Senior Admiral.Then WHICA: White House Communications Agency.WHICA is the peak of Western World Signals.  They carry POTUS signals traffic. Above NSA pecking order.Then he leaves the military…is offered a full ride scholarship to Harvard Law, that is a path to the Federal Bench or one of the Highest Paid Lawyers in Nation….but no… No.   Woodward tosses it all away to pursue his ‘dream’ of becoming a cub crime beat reporter in Washington, DC…for a second string newspaper.  &gt; This is the Equivalent of the Deputy Mayor of NYC tossing it all away to become a meter maid.   Bullshit.  Mr. Smith goes to DC bullshit.  He then is rapidly picked up by WAPO and gains access to the highest levels of source – Deputy FBI Director Deep Throat Mark Felt.  This in a town with more of a pecking order about Status than Constantinople.Woodward helped bring down a President, and only helped BTW.  After that every Democratic reporter wants to be Woodward…if you can’t make it learning a hard trade like Signals Communications you can always be a Courtier…In a characteristic interesting twist Bernstein actually reports on CIA infiltration of the media in 1977, all the way out into the sticks BTW.  The twist being of course Bernstein’s tortured Zhid conscience compels him to ‘leak’ the truth, or project.This is Bernstein, 1977 for Rolling Stone originally.http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.phpThe FBI is all over Bloomberg top to bottom with FBI alumni to this day.  Especially BB network techs.

                And Zman do you tend to blame more the journalists themselves or the guys paying their salaries above them? The companies that advertise?  I always thought if a journalist tried telling the truth they know they will be punished. If they lie for these oligarchs they know they will be rewarded.  A friend told me a new term. Presstitutes. Instead of Prostitutes are new media is just basically a Presstitute who does the bidding of men like Jeff Bezos who has no real world experience, no experience with being around Black people in Baltimore, or anything that would prove to useful to reporting on such things.  He tells these Presstitutes what to say and they know any deviating from the script means they will be fired and replaced.

They’re employees and employees do what their employer tells them to do.  Just as a factory worker punches out the same part day after day because that’s his job, the journalist punches out his “stories” day after day – which are a part of a larger product.

                The private equity firms buying up local media along with computer automation systems being installed in media outlets reduced the number of journalists needed to get content on the air.The bean counters eliminated journalism jobs while the automation allowed more content to hit the air.The result?23 year olds cutting and pasting the same stories from newscast to newscast and national stories are copied directly from CNN or the AP feed.For live news you get 23 year olds both jumping on trampolines giving us endless Covid numbers and the same reporters telling us about the Federal Reserve and it’s latest policy.That reporter doesn’t know shit about anything. But it’s air time filled and the content sells commercials.

                    Yep, there is a term for this type of article, but I forgot it after so many years.  Long ago in another time, I got a call from the local newspaper.  They wanted to do a local story about CS instruction (or something or other) and wished to send a photographer over.So what’s the big deal?  Well, I was told quite openly that this article’s theme was done a little while back by The Wall Street Journal and they were going to “update” (some term I forget) it for local consumption.They literally sent a photographer over and the “reporter” asked—over the phone—half a dozen questions while the photographer took pictures of students using the dept lab facilities.  Complete and total rip off of another’s creative efforts.

        I think a lot of people look normal compared to others but underneath they are just dumb. Dumb is celebrated.  Dumb can’t be questioned without being evil. And intelligence is often faked (just look at elite college admissions).  In recent years, everyone has a voice, so the dummies do all the talking.  Recently, my young adult daughter met a guy she likes.  I asked her to text him and ask him “how do you fire up a chainsaw?”.  He answered–is it gas or electric?  I decided the boy is a keeper and when I met him in person, I found him to be a solid guy (conservative too).  I’d recommend this simple test.

        “Eventually, the collection of jabbering airheads we see in charge of society will push the wrong combination of buttons the end times are upon us.”
Z-Man, they are pushing the wrong buttons on purpose. They are a catenation of postmodern nihilists who abominate the white West, and seek to destroy it through flagrant transgression of all tradition and all conventional morality. How do they imagine they’ll survive the cataclysm they author? They do not imagine. Their only desire is to destroy, and that longing is all-consuming.

        Calling these people managers and their system managerialism strikes me as inaccurate.Management, real management matters. A lot.  It requires intelligence, specific knowledge and has feedback loops that deliver consequences, positive and negative to the manager.The modern pseudo- management of large corporations and government, wherein people are rotated through vastly different positions with no expertise in the area they are temporarily “managing” and with absolutely no consequences for success or failure is an inversion of real management.  These people reign temporarily over the organizations they are putatively in charge of, with the organizations running themselves out of inertia.The media – court jesters are even less managers or figure heads.  The front people that the public sees are actors, literally, reading words written by others.  Their only expertise is doing so with conviction.  The people that write those words are likewise also not experts at anything other than fabulism.All of it taken together is just a show, a production of fiction for public consumption.

        “Jibbering airheads” and “nitwit”. I’ll be using those terms more often- especially nitwit, which has fallen out of fashion. I’m thinking “lamebrain” is due for a comeback, too.Back when I was young I had pretensions to being an intellectual, although like many with such ‘lofty’ goals I didn’t know how to do much of a practical nature- home and auto repair, etc were ( continue to be) beyond my capabilities. I did have however, a succession of real jobs in the DPS (Dread Private Sector) and I do know a lot of stuff, though, most of it useless- I marginally speak two foreign languages, one, German, slightly more useful than the other, Swedish- although knowing Swedish means I can read Danish and Norwegian! Whoopee!I guess this is my long winded way of observing that today’s intellectuals, in addition to mostly never having had jobs, don’t really know anything, either. I always think about Kam and Joe- anyone really think either of them could pass an American History SAT II? Even before Joe’s dementia kicked in. Has Kam the whore ever read a book like Dreadnought, or a Distant Mirror? You think the average NYT writer could pass a calculus class? Doubtful. And these are the “folks”, as Charlie Baker/Parker calls them, that have shut down our economies and societies, and are now telling us “one mask good, two masks better”Z- you’re fond of saying “we’re not voting our way out of this”. You’re right, but I don’t see anyway out of this.

            I think we’ve been taken over by a bunch of drama queen slapdicks who’ve never had a real job where they had to actually show up and work. The Protestant work ethic and ingenuity have been replaced with hedonistic laziness and stupidity.i’m a project manager and some of our young engineers (fresh out of school) told me the toilet in our end of the building wouldn’t flush and kept running.I asked them if they’d jiggled the handle, etc. They said they’d filled out a work order with maintenance hours before, but hadn’t heard back from them. I went in there, took the lid off and one of them told me he’d never done that. The chain had been disconnected from the handle. Two-second fix and not one of them even thought to check it. I was depressed. These are some of our best and brightest and they can’t fix a danged toilet.

                Heh.  A couple of weeks ago, I replaced both the float and the flapper device in one of our toilets where the tank has to be removed.  Of course I’d done it before, but not in many years.  I’d forgotten what a pain in the ass getting that thing back on, getting the screws down tight and scrunching under the toilet was!  Next time I’ll probably call the plumber…

                When I got married, I kept my bachelor pad as a rental property.  You wouldn’t believe what millennials are unable to fix.  One couldn’t figure out how to change the bulb on an outdoor deck light because it was halogen.  He thought the whole fixture had to be replaced.  He was a sales manager at AT&amp;T.  Another tenant had me come out and replace the toilet flapper, which is a $5 part requiring no tools.  I had to show another tenant how to light the pilot on the gas fireplace.  I finally sold the house last year due to Covid rules that make evictions impossible.

                    Funny you should mention such.  Seems to work both ways.  Both my children have started out in rental homes with the proviso that they get a deal on the rent and reimbursement for home repairs they do themselves.  They do it all.  Never thought much about it, but I guess we did something right in their upbringing.

                I’ve noticed a similar pattern with young people that I hire. They are smart enough and conscientious enough they but lack theinitiativeto do anything outside the box or beyond what’s explicitly communicated.
It’s a complete failure of the education system. They’ve been trained into little computers that execute whatever code their fed but completely passive outside that narrow scope.

                    The kids are smart because in most businesses workers that go outside the box get fired. With the exception of one IT gig, all the other jobs I had made it clear – do as you as told and nothing else.Maybe if the business community didn’t punish their workers for taking the imitative, they would not be so timid.

        But even the toughest structure will eventually succumb to the wrecking ball of incompetency.Yeah. I keep thinking of André Beaufre’s book detailing the failure of the French army in 1940. Recall that the French fought like animals in the Great War, and for centuries prior. Here was an army with good equipment, fighting for their lives, and led by men who were not incompetent. Yet, at the end, because of their simple inability to execute basic military things (disengage here, travel 4 miles there, punch the enemy in the flank) the high command was reduced to ordering their units to simply stand where they were and hold ground at all cost: it was the only order the army could execute.I’d suggest that the cause of that failure was that the country was built on lies dating to the Revolution. In any case, their military was effective until it was a complete failure. Lots of things work like that.

                I think you aren’t understanding what the French Republic was like, how their priorities were established, how pathologically it functioned. Imagine an American commander in 2025 being instructed to defend his country with a division of trannies. Is he incompetent if he can’t make them a useful fighting force?

                            Maybe Germany invaded France three times between 1870 and 1940. Yet this should not be confused with declaring war on France three times.Rather, the 1870 war was declared by France against Germany. It’s just that France had miscalculated who would then advance against whose territory.As to WWI, yes, Germany declared on France first. But WWI was a predetermined clusterfuck anyway. Once things were set into motion, it was clear where the battle lines would be drawn, with the order of precedence in declarations of war being merely ornamental.

                    Sure why not.  It’s not like he was drafted into that roll and cannot leave.
The broader, more relevant question however would be “competent at what?”.  The French military of the 1930s, like the US military today really wasn’t about defending the homeland.  So whose incompetence was it in structuring those militaries and then flinging them into a role they were not designed for.

                        Your ability to leave a role does not have bearing on your competency in doing it. The command was pretty good, the army was a complete mess, and most of the reason for it was that the Republic was, itself, a shitstorm of pathologies. A self-destructive people tend to create institutions that are also self-destructive.

        ” These hyper-confident morons fill the public space with whatever idiotic thing they heard last.”
To be frank, that sounds a lot like Trump; his opinions seemed to depend on whoever he talked with last. After all, what was he other than a media figure?

        I was rereading1984, and it struck me how similar Z’s writing style is to Emmanuel Goldstein’s (who may or may not be real). Oranges and lemons…The scene where Winston remembers playing Chutes and Ladders with his mother always gets me.

        Yep, pretty much the conversation I had with my daughter yesterday. A Stanford grad, but young, she doesn’t often give these things such depth of thought. Since she’s in genetics, the conversation turns often turns to HBD concepts and yesterday, we spoke about people who know absolutely nothing, but are in high places of decision making and influence. How do we, as non-experts, spot these people?Of course the two poster children for this phenomenon currently are Biden and Fauci. Unfortunately, it seems that there is no easy way for the average person to spot such frauds. It’s not that you need to be an expert in their respective fields, but you must have the ability to examine what these people say and do from a logical perspective aka “critical thinking”.Fauci for example again fell on his face last week with his “one mask good, two masks better” logical fallacy. A person with such “reasoning skills” has no business analyzing data and advising others on proper behavior. And of course, even imagining that this fraud reads any of current published research is a leap of faith not in evidence.Biden’s inauguration speech was analyzed at being at the 6th grade level or so. Indicative of his cognitive decline—not that he wrote it, but that it had to be that simplistic so he could read and recite it from a teleprompter. He is obviously a puppet in mental decline in direct control of others. But how many people can reason this?Like the writer Z-man uses as an example, these people are basically grifters. Their grift may vary wrt need for money, power, vanity—but they are grifters all the same. They say whatever they have to, to obtain their ends, not yours.

        I think most of these people are just lazy. With the resources we have available to us it would probably take about a day to become reasonably conversant on most things, but they don’t even seem to bother. Of course that assumes you have a decent high-school level education. I do have to laugh though, how do these people manage to survive? They are even ignorant of their ignorance.

        “The art of not knowing practical things was a big part of the life of a Russianintelligent. They took pride in not having practical skills or having a useful occupation.”Sounds like a certain ethnic group. Since I assume at this point the Russian intelligentsia was ethnic Russian, this is evidence for a point that the hardcore anti-Semites balk at: the Phoenicians would get nowhere unless their targets were already willing victims. As David Mamet says in Glengarry Glen Ross: “A guy don’t come on the lot lest he want to buy.” You have to transform your society into a Phoenician-friendly place first, then they naturally move in and take over.

        People who look down on GameStop need to look at the other shops in the same type of strip mall they occupy.  Vacuum and sewing shops, mom and pop donut shops, second hand dress shops, the Hallmark franchise etc.  These small businesses are like bumble bees, you don’t know how they fly, but they somehow do.  If you have a nice repeat local clientele, it matters a lot.

            The Silicon Valley segment of the ruling class is hyper-competent and seem to be bankrolling the control of the media.Silicon Valley isn’t all that competent.   The old computer hardware companies are pretty much all gone now.  Apple is doing well as a phone marketer – but that segment has reached the end of the innovation line and will follow the same trajectory as pc makers over the next twenty – thirty years.Social media companies have a dominate position now, but they have lower barriers to entry than the hardware companies had. And their arrogance is even greater.  Their internal management is also more destructive.  They too will decline over the coming decades – perhaps even faster than the hardware companies.

        AND, he’s a liar, obviously.  Check out this early quote:“There were countless real-life, tangible aspects and rituals of gaming in the ’80s and ’90s—leaving the console on all night to wrap up a game before school (you had to leave it running because there were no saves); bringing games or memory cards to a friend’s house (because nothing was in the cloud); perusing the rental store for a new game and momentously betting your allowance on one; gathering at the arcade and cheering on the whiz kid setting the high score.”The writer, “Addison”, was born in 1993.  He never did ANY of those things.  When you went to arcades, he wasn’t even a twinkle in his daddy’s eye.  But now, he’s writing authoritatively on the subject.Piss off, loser.  You have no idea what you’re even writing about, not because you necessarily choose not to, but because it was before your time.

        I am late to the party with a comment on this article, but I wanted to throw in a thought.This very phenomenon is one reason why I blocked and deleted a third or so of my old HS friends on Facebook over the course of a decade of interacting with them on that platform.An example discussion would be that of climate change/anthropogenic global warming. One old friend in particular was a true believer in that cult. She would constantly, and I mean CONSTANTLY, default to “the science” and “trusting said science”…which is not an altogether wrongheaded position, but her fatal flaw was her inability to grasp that her status as an X-Ray technician at a bone and joint clinic did not qualify her to have an opinion either way. (Not that I am 100% a credentialist either, mind you). The bottom line is that “the science” relies on a heavy amount of data that no ordinary person has the ability or time to thoroughly peruse through, that the qualified scientists who actually do are part of a clique who reinforce their biases in an echo chamber that doesn’t allow for criticism or dissenting analysis, and a whole litany of other variables that taint whatever truth there might be to the topic.And even setting aside the notion that such issues as “trusting the science” can be tainted by politics and other things, who is to say that science is always the default moral compass that we should defer to? I think of movies like “Contact” with Jody Foster and Mathew McConaughey as a good pop culture philosophical reference when I think about science, religion, and philosophy.But yea, the bottom line is that we live in a world full of people with opinions on things they have absolutely no special qualification or privileged position for which to comment.

        I used to to take my kid to GameStop years ago for events hosted by the store. My impression was that the store relied on these events to drive sales. People didn’t go there just to buy games. Social life in the age of WuFlu is a shadow of its former self. Enterprises that serve the human desire for personal contact have all suffered. It’s working out nicely for the managerial class since they seek to atomize society, reducing it to a collection of isolated individuals whose only connection is to government. “We’re all in this together.” No we’re not.

            Is anyone else old enough to remember comic book stores? When I was a wee lad, we had several in the neighborhood and one in particular next to the penny candy store and movie theater. It was quite common for kids at that time to buy a sweet treat on the way into a movie, and then pick up a comic book on the way home. Methinks Gamestop was a similar kind of cultural experience for the video gamer generation.

            The problem for the managerial elite is that they don’t deliver the basics to a profoundly atomized population, outside dopamine hits to White women from “likes” by useless celebrities. For Latinos, its nothing. They fall back on family networks, might as well be space aliens outside the media/managerial network.For White men, its atomization all the way. Nothing can make them love the CW, for example. All that wokeness is just fake and gay. Indeed being the racist bad boy who flouts authority is a sure fire way to create tingles in the ladies. And a lack of social networks makes hitting the anti-Woke, White males, hard. Sure they can jail Ricky Vaughn, but all that does is make every other White guy angrier and more atomized and remote from authority and the media/managers.Their issue is, the media propagates 24/7 the idea that all White men are innately evil and blacks, trannies, vibrant women of color, White women can all come together in hate hate hate of White men. That creates even more atomization and removal from society by nearly all White men. Who now have a vested interest in overturning the entire arrangement and view society as illegitimate. Atomization cuts two ways.

        “Knowing practical things like how to read an income statement is for prols. The managerial man does not have time for that. That is why the media is stocked to the gills with people who know nothing. They spent all of their time accumulating esoteric credentials that they can wear as moral signifiers. These impress the other managerial types. The result is a class of know-nothings.”‘Twas better in the old days, when without “Journalism” schools and Communications degrees, journos were, perforce, drawn from the ranks of those who must have had some experience as working people. Or maybe not: they were always just a bunch of drunks re-writing press releases. As the great “Dr.” Hunter S. Thompson said:“…Why bother with newspapers, if this is all they offer? Agnew was right. The press is a gang of cruel faggots. Journalism is not a profession or a trade. It is a cheap catch-all for fuckoffs and misfits – a false doorway to the backside of life, a filthy piss-ridden little hole nailed off by the building inspector, but just deep enough for a wine to curl up from the sidewalk and masturbate like a chimp in a zoo-cage.”And that was back in 1971, right before the big Watergate surge of press idolatry. Yet it never gets old.

        According tohis resume, he has never worked in the private sector.
Um, whatever else you might think about Del Mastro, the last time I looked the mediawaspart of the private sector. Has it been nationalized? (I mean, you know, formally…).

            Are you sure that it’s private?
it seams to me that at best it’s a partner of the government. That’s certainly how the midwits wee themselves. More likely, the relationship is even tighter with at least partial funding coming from the government.

                Benito Mussolini said fascism should properly be called “corporatism”, since it’s the union of government and business.




Public-Private will become Throne and Altar, Church and State, in my view. A managerial culture, where the feminine social-ist yin steps on the independent, masculine yang.

            Considering the media works as the gatekeeper and bully for the oligarchic ruling class(which also owns it) I’d say it’s not private sector at all.
