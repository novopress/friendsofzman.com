        Making a second comment, because this post was so salient.
I was reminded today of Trump’s “America First” mantra and how much it upset the elites.
Of course, something no one is pointing out is that to fix local issues (America First) would require identifying local problems. And it is precisely the elites who are the problem.
No wonder the elite are focused on problems elsewhere. Can’t have people cleaning out the trash in their own house if they’re too distracted by the entertainment elsewhere.

        Z Man you are like fine wine baby! You only get better with time.One caveat, the Viper does talk about the national debt. In fact he talks about all the right things. Things only Trump would dare say, and the Viper crosses the rubicon even farther than Trump. But I don’t want a man in the office of president, who is not a white man of European heritage.

        The imperial outlook is grim.  Ukraine is getting almost no money because the public cares more about Americans than Ukrainians, and rightly so.  Even bankable Israel is having trouble these days with their support mainly consisting of people saying “I don’t care what they do and long as we don’t have to fight or pay for it.”  You have mayors in sanctuary cities complaining about being overwhelmed.  That is local.  Their intention is to extract $$$ from the empire, but the focus is local.  The Government Party still runs in fear over gasoline prices.The entire Trump phenomenon is a manifestation of Main Street over Empire.  He may well be full of it, but he clearly has tapped into the 55-65% of the country that is uninterested in Empire.  It only seems like the public is focused on Empire because 99.999% of our media caters to 25% of the population of said Empire.The usual scams aren’t working.  That is why the Empire has turned to arresting its enemies.  It is why parents verbally accosting school boards is called “terrorism”.  It is why we get another drooling speech by Biden about “saving our democracy”.  I don’t think they realize yet how stupid he sounds having arrested Trump twice and having forced people to take vaccines that gave them heart problems.While the arrests and violence against normal citizens is scary, it is a sign of late stage empire.  The death throes.

        A good deal of the reason politicians don’t mingle with the people anymore is that it’s become too dangerous.Ever since Kennedy was assassinated in the early Sixties, the atmosphere of America has shifted. In certain ways, America has become a schizoid society, with sick members on one side and healthy members on the other. It used to be the sick were integrated with the healthy, but now the healthy only move away from them.In the same sense, it used to be that the rich didn’t live too far from the poor. Now the rich exclusively have their own circuits. America used to be a mass society. It is no longer. Like television’s fabled 500 cable channels, America has, in a sense, become Balkanized.(To read more of my stuff, click on my name with your mouse)

            The town halls ended during the Obama regime because what he was doing was immoral and Congressman couldn’t defend Obama and couldn’t defend why they were refusing to do anything about it.  So the “town halls” became shouting matches.  They tried Zoom for a while then gave up pretending to give a rat.
And it wasn’t that long ago.  10-12 years at most.

        “No one running for anything talks about the fact that America has a $34 trillion dollar debt and that we spend almost $15,000 per person per year on medical services. America is a sick society that is becoming too broke to mend itself.”
Z-Man: it could help a lot if a post of yours dealt with the subject: if/when the Empire is ever going to have to stop issuing currency limitlessly. In case the answer for the next 50 years is” yes”, I’d like a forecast of what would follow the inability to expand debt infinitely.

            I think the issue of debt is very relevant and could be the mechanism by which the GAE collapses. We are in uncharted territory financially and so I think no one has any knowledge of how long this can go on. It could all crash next week or in five years. But hyperinflation and a crash seem to be unavoidable now.It will probably be used as a reason to introduce CBDCs but hopefully they do not retain sufficient control to implement thisThe fact that the dollar is now like Wile E Coyote standing in mid air, is one reason it is important to have basic supplies to deal with a period of societal chaos

            They no doubt have a plan, or plans, to increase demand for the currency so they can print more of it/monetize the debt. Since they have no other choice than to monetize the debt. I don’t know what these plans are, and even if I did I couldn’t tell you whether or not they’ll work. But I’m certain they have them. If you think within the bounds of conventionality, then yes the currency seems doomed to fail, but these plans are no doubt unconventional. Just as the petrodollar was. Maybe their plans “work,” and maybe they don’t. Even the regime itself doesn’t know.And they don’t give a damn what your medical care costs

            Quigley criticizes the FDR admin’s handling of the GD in Tragedy and Hope, saying they didn’t understand the nature of money. If I understand him, he was talking MMT— in the mid 60s!
Keep in mind he had access to the CFR’s records in his research.

                Certainly you are trolling us… Of course defaulting on the largest debt in world history is going to have global negative consequences. And therefore “matters.”I hope Z doesn’t kick me off here for telling the truth, as this is the truth blog.,,  You are a moron!

        As chaos picks up speed we should do the opposite of worrying about Israel, the Ukraine or the weather in eighty years. Focus on family, friends, local situation, local supplies. Politics today is macro over micro. Israel s border over El Paso, Kiev control of some town over potholes in your streets. Harvard over the perverts in the local school. But micro beats macro. Macro is primarily important because it eventually impacts micro

            Moran ya Simba:  YES!  See my reply to Lineman way down the thread.  ” . . . if I ever go looking for my heart’s desire again, I won’t look any further than my own backyard; because if it isn’t there, I never really lost it to begin with.”Most here still remained focused on the macro – it’s hard to break conditioning you’re not even aware of half the time.  But instead of crowing or agonizing over who’s the titular head of Harvard – which has been occupied and gutted and used as a skin suit for many decades already – focus on your own.  Start home schooling.  Steer your children to a future that doesn’t entail college debt and anti-White propaganda.Live your values.

                Agree. I too follow the big picture news. But it’s a deliberate distraction. What influence do we have on Israel or the Ukraine??
Influence on how to get medicines, water, food or on not living right next to a ghetto. Here we are actually in control.
Part of it, for me and I’m sure many others here, is that what’s happening on the macro level saddens me to no end. But there is absolutely nothing we can do about it. Unlike our own situations. Put our energy where it matters

        The closest thing to a candidate actually talking about things important to the American people is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.. He is a liberal Democrat but his liberalism is somewhat antique now, with today’s liberals enthused about the CIA, the military, big business, and imperial America.

                        Trump did not get us out of any wars, although, to his credit, he did not get us into any new ones. His actions in the Covid episode were disastrous.RFK will mostly draw from independent voters; most Democrats are now of the sort I cited above: in love with the FBI, CIA, military, censorship, and Globohomo imperialism.

        It’s popular around here to say that the demise of the GAE was an inevitable result of the words in its founding documents, and while that’s true, what’s just as true, and often overlooked by the right (but not by the left), is that it has been an empire from day 1, and thus never really had much of a chance to be a real nation.This is not so for most other nations that became empires. They were nations first. AINO never really was. Thus, the nations that were nations first, after their empires waned or collapsed, were able to go back to being just nations, while the odds of AINO doing so don’t look very good. Maybe if there had been no GR it would have had a chance to, but that chance is gone.

            “Thus, the nations that were nations first, after their empires waned or collapsed, were able to go back to being just nations.”
I can go along with that. Just look at how the Ottoman empire became the ethnocentric Turkey, or the British empire became just Britain, or the Soviet Union became just Russia. There was a national core to these places that never existed for the USA.

                The list goes on. Persia, China, Japan, Mongolia….. but I get the sense that Rome was pretty much an empire from the outset. Italy as a  “nation” was only a very recent development and it looks shaky.
The UK, I dunno, its relationship with the GAE makes it kind of a special case among empires. Of course the GR dooms it as well.

            The founders who wrote the founding documents had zero interest in global empire. They were for the the most part isolationists. As they had seen what the British French, and Spanish empires got them. Nothing but trouble. Your thesis is abjectly flawed.

        “Well into the 19th century the typical American had little reason to care about the federal government because it was far away and did nothing that was of a great concern to the average person.”  You might want to re-consider that.  The “Tariff of Abominations” was passed in 1833, causing a rift in the attitudes of the Confederate states, and ultimately, Civil war.

            This is a good statement of the problem of the Swamp. Each of our institutions, big and small, has a Swamp of nameless bureaucrats who will undo any efforts to reassert local or legitimate control. When the peasants revolt and they have to give up their latest diversity hire they just wait a while and find someone who will do the same things in a slightly less obnoxious way. My local library even has a little swamp, maybe call it a puddle, but it’s a bunch of SJW wammen who always make sure that the “current issues” table is full of tranny and anti-White books. Every school of course has a little swamp too. Trump identified the problem. He didn’t drain the big Swamp or any of the little ones, but that’s what’s needed.

        Governments, regardless of their composition, have a sort of centrifugal force.  Everything becomes centralized over time.  All decisions of importance are made in the capital.  Like a hurricane, a government feeds on the warm waters of productivity and tax revenue. The income tax alone, once established in 1913, was like the Gulf of Mexico on its hottest day.  Drawing the heat from the water, expanding exponentially, this goes on and on, the eye wall narrows to the point where you have nothing but an Alzheimer’s patient and his political insiders making all the decisions.  Fate carries the hurricane to a different region.  It hits cold waters, like Iraq, or Afghanistan, or Ukraine.  It looks for warmth wherever it can find it.  Eventually, finding no warmth, it attempts to generate its own warmth using the printing press.  This fails too an the storm flies apart.  We’ve been in this storm for a long time.  We were born into this and should it ever end it will be the end of an age.

            Indeed. Everything tends toward more governmental creep and centralization. It is interesting that you point out the Income Tax, as I had just been listening to various talks about it’s impact on the average American citizen. Certainly, the means of the State to steal a persons income is a very serious development, very sad.Once the pioneers/freemen have come in and tamed the land, government just seems to expand. As Z mentions, those first fellows escaping England looked out for Them and Theirs first – the natural order. A bottom-up approach, if you like.Now it’s just top-down directives aimed at pushing “fairness” or “equality”, or whatever.

        This is a thought I haven’t fully fleshed out but the vibe I have is that the past century or so has been the story of placeholders/titles becoming a replacement for gut instinct (I like or I don’t like this person).Not only is this the case with things like money, prestige or credentials but also in things like photography, forensics or film. People tend not to believe something unless they have video or picture evidence. But once that can be faked, there will be a weird interregnum where people will fall for hoaxes, without there being a new way to judge things.

        There was an earthquake in Japan Monday, planes crashing into each other on the tarmac in Tokyo and an explosion went off in Iran yesterday.  In yesteryear we wouldn’t have found out about them or if we did, perhaps a week after they happened there may have been a line or 2 about them  in the paper.  It’s useless information overload.

        An excellent observation, Zman.
I remember noticing, back in the Soviet Union days, a stark difference between the Russians and the Americans.
The communist camp was, in every aspect, an empire, and every Russian seemed to know the outcome of the latest military coup attempt in Burkina Faso.
A typical American would only know/care about the local sports team score and local weather. Back then, I thought about how primitive and parochial we are. It took time to realize that we simply were normal people.

America, in contrast, faced no such threats until it began its ‘invade the world, invite the world’ empire.  It would, of course, depend on when you were in the Soviet Union and with whom you spoke, but my experience there (1981-1982) was quite different.  The average individual I dealt with had no such interest in far-flung nations and was primarily concerned with western cloths and music as well as standard domestic issues – not terribly different from your normal heritage American.

                Agreed. I strongly doubt your average Soviet subject could find Upper Volta on a map, let alone discuss a military coup there. Even more than Americans, he was concerned with the daily struggle to survive in a harsh forbidding world.

        “…our politics, in general, deliberately shifts the focus from the local and practical to the distant and obscure. “This has never surprised me, nor does it seem new in my lifetime.  Local problems are not only difficult to solve in a multi-cultural society, but fraught with danger in the attempt.  If the average Joe can be convinced of some existential problem far away from his ability to monitor progress/achievement made in its “solution”, then that is in the interest of our ruling elite—as they can pretend to be accomplishing something, while doing nothing.  (Z-man seems to imply the elite are actually interested in solutions for these “problems”.)   Israel for example has been problematic since its creation and we’ve been down this road  in one form or another now over and over for some 80 or so years—same old, same old.On the other hand, an elite promising to provide jobs, safe streets, and in general local prosperity treads on dangerous ground, because people can directly measure such progress within their local environment.  Here in Tucson, we elected a local mayor who ran on a platform of fighting “global warming”, although even if successful (?) the results would/could never be apparent in most voters’ lifetimes!Perhaps this platform flys in Palo Alto, CA, but Tucson is the poorest, most crime ridden city in AZ.  Homeless camps spring up along major roadways and the streets are in such disrepair that one needs a truck to navigate them.  IA’s are dumped in the city center in the dead of night by Border Patrol.  Only 13% of public school children are at grade level in math, and 22% at reading level.  Try running on a platform of “solving” any one of those problems and see if you remain in office for even one term—since any solution proposed will /must ignore the cause, race and culture!

            Upvote for your second paragraph. The greater the ‘crisis’ and the harder to define the ‘crisis’ is, the harder to gauge success in fighting the ‘crisis’. Climate change is the ultimate ‘crisis’ because nobody knows what a solution looks like, let alone the problem.
In addition, without constant propaganda, I doubt if any normal person would have noticed ‘climate trends’, or said that ‘it is getting hotter’, ‘or the waves are rising’. All our evidence comes from funny averages and statistics compiled by people far away with, most likely, an agenda or some such.
Evil.

            This may be what ultimately will drive the rise of some strongman locally or nationally. The problems of Tuscon or the country itself *can* be solved but only by someone willing to run roughshod over the various ethnic whiners and race pimps. The situation in the Southwest and the country as a whole have gone beyond the point where democratic approaches that respect people’s feelings and preferences could work. This may be something of a law of history in fact. Multicultural societies can get to point where only a strongman can fix the problems.

        There is something to be said about the Tolkienesque diminishing with each successive age (The Long Defeat).  That with however America has solved/answered a crisis or confrontation and shaped the aftermath, the subsequent age loses something.

            Jeremy:  Even if one does speak with a purportedly ‘local’ politician, it’s irrelevant.  They have already been vetted and chosen and funded by the local party organization with an eye towards a long ‘career in public service’ and national office.  I quite bluntly challenged a candidate for in-state representative on a local street corner.  He shook my hand, looked me straight in the eye, and answered in a way convincingly enough for me to hazard a vote for him – way back in 2010.He went on to become a Texas rep in Congress who voted lockstep with Con, Inc. and in direct opposition to everything he had claimed to support, with seemingly heartfelt conviction.  He was later exposed as having an affair with a Bangladeshi and left national politics.tl;dr:  They are all liars and whores, bought and paid for long before you saw their name as a candidate for whatever office.  Back before 1940 it may have been different, especially in rural areas, but there is nowhere in AINO today that has anyone – in any city council – who gives a tinker’s damn about local issues and the lives of genuine heritage Americans.

        People care about practical concerns, and they care about principles as well, and in actual life it is not possible to draw a firm dividing line between one and the other. They weave together like the warp and weft to make the fabric of our lives. For instance, I do not think of the president of Harvard being a plagiarist and data fabricator as a distant issue which does not affect me. It affects me every time I want to read an article or look up some information for a project I’m working on. I need to know that the people responsible for generating that information are governed by a standard. If I can trust them, then I don’t have the facts I need to make my own very practical decisions.Those yeoman farmers of old who would thunder and cuss at the town hall meeting would also go home and write their congressman to express their thoughts about bimetallism, and to read the studies in the latest big university ag journal about how to increase their wheat harvest. The universal affects the particular. It isn’t the one or the other we should pay more attention to, but getting all things right is the challenge.

            The problem as you state is not one of all or nothing, but perhaps one of priority of effort/interest.  The illegitimate president of Harvard interests me as Harvard is/was a jewel in the crown of the once great country of America.  Its decline is now made apparent and shameful, and so I am ashamed as a former academic.However, my own alma mater, close by, is also currently in Leftist shambles and that interests me even more as I was once a direct part of it and can not disassociate myself from its new “reputation”.Accordingly, Israel is of much *less* interest—aside from costing me and mine blood and treasure—to my life.  Those who rant and rave about Israel this and Humas that are (IMO) simply being duplicitous as I believe them to being in thrall to powerful anti-American, pro-Israel powers.

            Under the story announcing the new Harvard prez was this one:
https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/12/21/hmc-goldstein-israel-trip/
In the Harvard announcement, not a word about the past five years of white erasure under Gay. You have to be impressed by the gains made only two months into the crisis. Two more Ivy president’s positions, and a reason to funnel more of the Harvard endowment into investing in the Homeland, not to mention the coming territorial gains. If that is a crisis, well, crisis is now a synonym for a victorious rout.
Despite all the noticing, the juggernaut rolls on.

                Wish I was as hopeful.  What about all those mediocrities out there in high positions by dint of “color” who did *not* obviously plagiarize their credentials?  We have discussed here previously that Gay obviously was passed by her committee on her submission of a plagiarized Dissertation when it was  or should have been pretty obvious.  These folk I’m sure would be happy to look lightly upon any substandard work by a minority check box.  This is what I’ve feared—a general decline in standards due to pressure to promote DIE candidates (or else).What I fear is yes, the “juggernaut roles on”, but it will be a  continuation of simply a more careful DIE mediocre candidate placement/recruitment.

After SCOTUS tepidly slapped down affirmative action admissions, the Harvards of the world brazenly publicized how they would work around it and continue to piss on whitey.  This won’t slow them down at all, if anything they’ll cast about for a female black dyke as a way of upping the ante.

                    My post was not at all hopeful Compsci. I think we agree on what is likely to happen.I would think that at some point early on in Garber’s tenure he would release some sort of reform plan. That plan would tell you what the approach to this is going to be. In looking at the announcement, it seems to focus on the plagiarism issue, and obviously the symbolism of who is replacing Gay is, well, very noticeable.A serious reform plan would, in my view, look something like:1. We commit to an admissions program where only those who meet the highest standards based on objective admissions criteria that rely solely upon demonstrated excellence that is reliably measured according to the centuries and millenia long traditions of American and Western Civilization.2. We will end the destruction of cultural vandalism that was institutionalized under previous administrations. Harvard has traditionally honored and recognized persons of tremendous character and accomplishment. We will restore all public honorarium that has been defaced and removed by previous administrations. We will do so by performing the original dedication ceremonies for every single honorarium that has been defiled.3. We renounce the vilification and demonization of the people who founded, built and cultivated Western Civilization. Harvard is an important root and branch of its tree. We renounce the vilification and demonization of the institutions of the Occidental people. We are one of its institutions and we will nurture, preserve and make Harvard fertile again. Harvard will once again become a leading institution of higher learning. We reaffirm our commitment to preserving and cultivating Western Civilization and serving the American nation.4. We acknowledge that the infantilization of intellectual life and politics is a great tragedy and that since the 1960s, Harvard has played a leading role in it. We will reflect upon our mistakes and rectify them. Morality is complex as reality is complex. We will no longer coddle weakness, cowardice and intellectual dishonesty as we acknowledge that for too long we have done so. We will atone for this shameful degradation by cultivating strength, wisdom and temperance. We hereby commit to once again seeking guidance from our ancestors and predecessors and their rich traditions as we return to their morality – the morality of builders and protectors of our rich and treasured civilization. The days of emotional hysterics and shallow sloganeering and shaking our fist at the system while we reap its benefits are over. We no longer tolerate this childish and foolish behavior. If Harvard and its alumni are to be respected and worthy of that respect, we must respect the society and traditions that we cultivate ourselves to serve. That is our purpose – to cultivate ourselves to be of service to America and its people and their place amongst the nations of the world.5. We acknowledge that the University system has been the breeding ground for the attack on Western Civilization, and that Harvard has played a significant part. We acknowledge that this attack has also targeted white people or people of European descent. Harvard has permitted and coddled the open expression of genocidal malice against European descended, aka white, men and attacked its culture. Look around you. Nearly all of what you see, Harvard itself, is a creation of white men. We acknowledge this fact and we lead the way in being grateful for their past, present and surely future accomplishments. We live in a world where people from every nation will cooperate and collaborate. They will also compete. One of the geniuses of Western Man is his propensity to compete with honor and in accordance with rules that are fair and just. This has resulted in the most unprecedented upward propulsion in art, science, sport and martial endeavor in human history.We renounce the now institutionalized anti-white bigotry and calls for genocide against the European descended people. As such, today I revoke the professorship of Noel Saul Ignatiev and the other professors who Harvard has tenured, paid and promoted to promote this hateful filth. I will be conducting a full review of our faculty and all curriculum. The books and lectures of Ignatiev and his acolytes will not be banished. Nay, they will remain as evidence of the depths of depravity to which once great Harvard has sunken. Someday, when Harvard has returned to its traditions and the standards that those who established them set for us, those vile teachings will be the measure of just how far our ascent back toward the transcendent has been.I wouldn’t count on this happening until a white man who has and uses his courage, conviction and skill to assume the Presidency of Harvard once again. Let us see.

There is too much power in the hands of the faculty.  You must kill this first—and that starts with tenure.  We have a President of our other major University, ASU, who declared a fiscal crisis during a budget shortfall and that shut the faculty up pretty much since *they* were now subject to RIF’s.  Anyway, faculty are waay too Leftist and way too powerful.

                    Based on observation and experience, I’ve found that most of the affirmative action types know exactly why they are in their jobs. They also know that we know too. That knowledge makes them angry at the rest of the world. They are also terrified that all that will be taken from them when we finally wake up. There is a deep, earned inferiority complex in all of them.

        “Over several generations the people have been conditioned to care more about the bogeyman and Israel than their own neighborhood. A practical candidate could go into a suburb strewn with trash and illegal aliens promising to clean up both and the locals would demand to know his position on the war in Gaza or abortion.”Yes, the internet age has permanently debunked the old American adage that “all politics are local”. I live in a very old but affluent suburb of NYC and our infrastructure is crumbling. The local elections are dominated by BS like LBGTQ+ issues, gun control, abortion rights and climate change. The local Karens expect the mayor to have a view on Israel. But when it rains, the sewers flood……

                The problem I believe is that we all get used to our environment  (normalcy bias) and also that we find relatively benign areas within the overall hellscape to dwell in.  These NYers (I am a former one) will also—without taking a breath—tell you where in the city you should not tread and when, then proceed on to tell you NYC is the “greatest city on earth”.     😉Here  in the city where live, and I often acknowledged is one of those hellscapes, I have a buffer zone of several miles all around where I can breath freely and live safely—albeit, the children had to be send to private charter schools.  That’s why I don’t leave, although I have no other financial /social reason to stay.  And so, here I’ll die.BTW:  If I had $20M+, I’d actually consider a major city like NYC.  I’m exceptionally fond of the museums, food and the high arts to be found there.   🙁

        Elites have always cared more about cultural issues and foreign policy than local issues. They simply have no real connection to local issues or local people. It just bores them.When you live in gated communities (or very rich areas), send your kids to private school and hang out at the club, what happens in town doesn’t much matter to you, so if you think about politics at all, you think about the cultural issues fashionable to your people and international affairs if that’s your bent. They live a life apart.Most regular people get their news from elite-controlled outlets – or, at least, they used to – so they focus on what the elite focus on in as much as they care at all.That said, the empire is quite obviously in decline and the public seems pretty tired of worrying about the rest of the world. The people are beginning to look inward even if the elite doesn’t want to. Nobody cares about Israel or Ukraine or China. What’s more, you can definitely see people no longer caring about pronouns or being called racist.Everyday people are turning away from what matters to the elite. But the elite don’t want to pivot with them. Part of Trump’s appeal is that he occasionally talks about issues that matter to the people, like immigration, wages and crime. DeSantis, before he turned neocon, talked about immigration and CRT, which made him popular. King Cobra is also playing that game, so is JD Vance.Some of the elite are figuring out that the public mood has changed. Whether they actually care about the people is questionable at best. But they do care about going down into the history books. Granted, the Gracchi brothers might early and grim deaths, they are remembered. And not all elites who lead the public against the other elites end up dead.Sooner or later, an elite will rise who craves power and glory more than the approval of his class. Trump isn’t quite that guy, but he’s definitely showing the path.

                Right now, I’d say that the rising crop of competing elites won’t ours. They’ll be Indian, maybe a little Asian.
That said, I do believe that there are more and more young whites who will rise to elite status who no longer view the current elite as their own people. As competing non-white elites emerge and refuse to fall in line to current elite class, those whites might start getting some ideas. At least, that’s what I hope.

            The system may be complete enough that a rival elite (or true rivalry among the elite) has become an impossibility. Things that don’t exist usually can’t.Everyone Peter Thiel pays is just another enemy—of the people, not the system, or he wouldn’t be allowed to do it. Even minimal dissent triggers wild immune-system attacks. Musk and Trump are full-on regime enemies and they’re not even remotely dissident. They’re barely even reformists. They want the machine to work more like it says on the box, and they think that its not doing so is an accumulation of error that can be corrected by elite decision—by *successful bossing*, because they’re successful bosses. They’re too literal-minded to fully fall in line, but they’re very, very, very close to it.Nobody can conceive of things really being different. Our only political philosopher, Nick Land, prescribes more of the same until it fails whole into something else. What? Whatever. /ourguys/ say: Wait til the food or the credit runs out. Then we’ll see! See what? Whatever.I think we’ve solved the Fermi Paradox.

                A few years ago I did a post on what China and Russia think about the American military. I used publicly available papers from their connected institutions. The point of my post was that the Russians and Chinese were keenly aware of America’s demographic crisis, as well as their own challenges. Reading this stuff, I got the sense that both Russia and China were thinking about how the American empire winds down. They do not want collapse. They want a slow retreat into the Western hemisphere.I suspect that may be the result. Over the next fifteen years we see de-dollarization, the scaling back of the military and a decline in our standard of living. How that effects domestic politics is the main question.

                    It’s the Double DDs that matter to the US: the dollar and demographics.Our demographics are moving toward Brazil. There’s a reason Brazil isn’t sending carrier strike groups around the world. A workforce that’s majority non-white and lower-IQ whites will not sustain an empire nor a large, highly-skilled military.Sure, you could have a very highly-skilled smaller military, but not one capable maintaining global superpower status. And, as you mention, the Chinese and Russians are well aware of this and hope to keep us from lashing out before we accept the end of empire.Which is what make the dollar so important. I’m still one who believes that de-dollarization will take a lot longer than people think (no alternative and the massive network effect will ensure that), but it’s obvious that RoW is working very hard to push that forward.What’s interesting is that nobody really wants to unseat the dollar. They saw what being global reserve currency did to the US economy. Who wants that?What they want are two things. First, they want a new global reserve asset. Treasuries give the US too much power. They want another asset or assets that allows them access to dollars or credit in times of need. Second, they want alternative payment systems so the US can’t cut them out.Basically, I don’t think that de-dollarization will look like what people think. However, it will still have the effect of reducing our standard of living and making a giant military unaffordable. If we are forced to fund our own deficits/debt, we are a very different country.Regardless, I agree. China, Russia, the whole world knows that we are in decline and just wants to manage us as we descend. It’s why China and Russia are so careful not to take the bait when we push them. Neocons think that it’s a sign of weakness when, in fact, it’s a sign of strength.

Seriously.The only fly in the ointment is that Western elites are degenerating so fast that it’s not inconceivable that they perpetrate some ridiculous Klein Bottle Head Up Ass Singularity of Stupendous Stupidity which effs it all up for all of us.When the British elite had their Suez Moment they were degenerate and dissipated but still had enough common sense and realism to take the L quietly without fuss so that they could continue to enjoy their overdrafts at Coutts and keep up the drug-soaked sex parties with Princess Margaret and each other in all imaginable combinations in the Bahamas while the remnants of empire slowly but surely gurgled down the shitter and the steel and textile mills rotted and decayed. What did it matter, really, as long as the sun shined in the Bahamas and Belgravia?I don’t see the Kagans &amp; Co going down with the setting of the sun with quite the same effete gracefulness.

                        It’s a hot potato, and somebody is going to end up holding it. As you say, nobody seems willing to step up, and that is, perhaps, what’s drawing the process out. But events will force somebody to be the world’s banker. They’ll get rich and the locusts will devour them, like us. And our agony will end.
To the ambitious, such reticence will look like weakness. To the cautious, such ambition looks reckless. I’m not sure who’s right tbh, although count me as cautious lol.

                        Responding to Zaphod: do you believe the British elite were more degenerate than the US elite in the 1950s or today?
As for effeminate:there’s a reason the global AIDS epidemic began in the US and that to this day an American is much more prone to having AIDS than Europeans.

                I remembering the other day that it was bad, but not this bad, until Obama got elected. A black guy without natural-born citizenship becoming president was so aberrant the crazies thought the coast was clear. (His father was a Kenyan, or an American commie, some say. Which would’ve made him natural-born. Either way, SHENANIGANS.)
15 years is long enough to make anything seem like the new normal. Maybe we fell off the cliff, or maybe it yet proves to be an aberration. Idk.

                I disagree. I think that the Indians are quietly and not-so-quietly forming a competing elite. I also think that more than a few whites are wondering about the same thing.King Cobra is a good example. He’s come up through the elite ranks and should be another lackey, but he’s playing his own game. I simply don’t believe that he wants to be another Jew-controlled house slave like Haley. (I don’t think he cares about us either, btw.)Indians won’t be happy under the thumb of other groups, particularly Jews, nor do they see those other elites as their own.The changing demographics of the elite will cause problems for them. I was at an elite school a few weeks back visiting a family friend. The campus is full of Asians and South Asians and various other mystery meat types. Still plenty of white kids and presumably a decent number of Jews, but they are equally matched by others – others who don’t feel a need for their approval or to be their lackey.

                    What is important for us is that plenty of our plenty of white kids are pursuing real educations – particularly our men.King Cobra is proving the utter folly of Stephen Steinleighter’s hubris is stating willy nilly that Jews will form an alliance with Asians to divide and conquer. He literally said that in broad daylight.King Cobra and his tribe aren’t going to just accept second fiddle to a tribe just because they say so.This all goes back to a theme that comes up over and over. European man needs to take care of our own business and do what is needed at an individual and collective level to get ready for this new reality.The pie is going to shrink and the number of mouths to feed is far higher and those that are used to feasts won’t take less without a fight. We tribe up and we will be okay. We don’t and we are going to be hurting.

            “ What’s more, you can definitely see people no longer caring about pronouns or being called racist”
/facepalm
This is a completely delusional statement.  5 years ago I didn’t have to worry about pronouns at all to keep my job
Conservatives have been predicting the end of the race card since the beginning of civil rights movement.
But the right never seems to remember that their coping got them nowhere in the past, so they keep on saying the same copes over and over gain.

                Disagree, at least anecdotally. I’ve seen more push back at work and among friends/neighbors over the past year or so than I’ve seen in my life. Sure, Grillers are going to grill, and the DEI seminars will continue, but something is changing.That said, the retarded colorblind CivNat aren’t discovering white identity politics, but they are getting fed up with bowing down to every fat black chick that calls them racist. Most of them are pointless, but a few will find their way here.The point is that the hate whitey campaign is starting to meet some resistance. Again, where that goes, I don’t know.

        OT: There is a widespread assumption based on her attitude, appearance and probably influenced by the coincidence of her surname that the ugly fraud “Dr.” Gay is a lesbian. While I wouldn’t put it past her to have licked some labia in her time, she does not identify that way. She is in fact married to a man, a white academic named Christopher Afendulis. They have a teenage mulatto son.

        A long time ago, back in the 90s, Ross Perot used to campaign using those handmade charts showing economic problems such as the vast debt and the rapidly hollowing out of the industrial base.  It was all framed in the context of how this affects everyone’s family including the next generations.
In the Global American Empire, those things that are important to families don’t matter.  Globalization means water seeks its own level, where wages for American workers go down, schools and towns flooded with foreigners, and just shut up and consume.

        Nothing changes until the environment changes, and therefore nothing significant is going to change until we have a collapse-like event here in the USA. And the sooner that happens, the faster will be the rebound.But we have been too affluent for too long now and most Americans are too wedded to a very comfortable living standard and can no longer tolerate the notion of what a collapse, and ensuing hardship, would be like. We have become soft and weak, and burying your head in the sand is preferable to waking up to reality. As such, we will sleep-walk into the coming disaster and only get off the couch when the cupboard has been bare for 3 days.Hard truth. There will be wailing, gnashing of teeth, and street riots. And a lot of culling. Don’t be in a big city when it happens. We cannot stop this outcome with voting harder. Indeed, ultimately, the collapse is the cure. And only the strong will make to the other side (as it should be). Your choice is simple. Get strong or get dead.

        “In fairness, a candidate who ran on a platform of deregulating the health care rackets and restoring order to the legal system would have no audience.”He might have an audience. The problem is he wouldn’t have the donor support. Finance capitalists — who benefit from the various cartels that constitute what’s left of the US economy — benefit from the health care system, unending wars, and so on.The voters have become the least important part of the pay-to-play political system. If necessary the votes can be fabricated, as we saw in 2020.Along the lines of the rest of your post, cast your mind back half a century.to the Nixon administration. Nixon did a number of things on the domestic front — the wages and prices policy, increasing science and arts spending, the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, the creation of the EPA, On the international front, the ABM Treaty, SALT 1, rapprochement with China, the withdrawal from Vietnam, the new modus vivendi with the petro-states. Contrast this with today — just war, war and more war. There is no policy platform. A president  who is a mere figurehead and is a creature with no brain, no spine, no moral compass, and no soul. A cabinet that seemingly doesn’t do anything. I’m not sanguine about the future for the GAE.

I think it’s been that way for a long time.  Taxpayer is just another word for slave, really.  No voice, constantly ignored and humiliated, just a fungible source of labor and money for the govt.

                        I’m not convinced that’s true. Over half the households pay no net income tax at best, and many get subsidies. Those who net out would not exert any inflationary pressure were the tax to go away, and those who are subsidized would lose those subsidies, a deflationary pressure.The net taxpayers are heavily skewed — the top 1% pay a vastly disproportionate fraction, but taxes are only affecting their purchasing decisions at the margin.All income tax does is provide a fig leaf for borrow and spend policies. Without a plausible mechanism for government’s full faith and credit, the profligate borrow and spend could not even happen.

            “The voters have become the least important part of the pay-to-play political system.”As a counter argument, consider The Donald. He provided the seed money to get his message out, but his principal financial support was middle America. Bernie Sanders was similar with his Bernie Bros, but the difference is The Donald went on social media often and bluntly said business as usual was the problem, but the message Bernie sent to his echo chamber was that we needed the same thing, but a whole lot more of it.Like it or not, apart from a collapse, the only possible way out of this that I can see is embracing nasty tweets. If one gets the vapors over “offensive” words, how will he do when Donquarious and Jonquarious start curbstomping him?

Trump was an accident that a complacent oligarchy didn’t anticipate and so didn’t take seriously until it occurred. Everyone was shocked by his electoral victory, including Trump himself. There’s not going to be a repeat of that. The popular voice must not find a means of realising itself through a populist leader.

                    Maybe. Or maybe that’s just pessimism speaking.
Now that the formula for success is out there for any to emulate, (a two-fold strategy — anti-establishment and vote fortification) I doubt they will be able to contain it. Not without full thuggery, which is equivalent to collapse, eventually.

            Won’t argue Nixon, but will state for the record that his expansion of the “nanny” State was perhaps the greatest of any President since.  He outdid all Democrats in that respect.
I must also admit that most all of these agencies were needed at the time, it’s just that they would prove—in hindsight—unlimited in scope and duration.  And here we are today.

                Some of us half-jokingly say he was the last social democratic president of the USA. The turn to neoliberalism began with Carter, picked up steam with Reagan, and went on steroids with Clinton. Nixon also said, “We’re all Keynesians now.” No subsequent president would say that. Keynesianism was part of the social contract back then. It had run its course by around 1970 but I would be seriously digressing if I went into all that.

But I might disagree. I don’t see the need for it to be either/or. In my opinion one needs to be keenly aware of both local issues AND those that are far away. In both our countries, the most dire problems start at the top, and then tumble down to crush the lowly dirt people like the proverbial turd rolling downhill.

            It is one thing to be aware of international issues; it is another to keep sticking your nose in it (or being the instigator of them).  Sure we can be “aware” of the Isreal/Hamas thing, and we can say “no thank you – work it out between yourselves.”  Same with kraine.
If we weren’t sending trillions around the world to be “keenly aware” we would be in much better shape now.

For the US, not really. We need only be reasonably fair to the rest of the world, ensure their property rights and keep the shipping lanes open, and we don’t need to think about the rest of the world at all, except for vacations.

                    Extending on that, to the DR, increasing the level of piracy would be a good thing. Every cheap Chinese container ship that is stolen increases the costs to Chinese manufacturers, plus we can buy those goods from Somali and Yemeni “merchants” at fire sale prices. Of course, it also makes manufacturing those goods in America more favorable.
If the Chinese want access to the American market, they can damn well pay the full costs of delivering their goods here.

        Well maybe it’s true that “The founding of the country was by people who had the exact opposite view of the world. They came to the new world for selfish reasons. They did not want “freedom” or “liberty” “. This tends however to contradict what some of the settlers had to say about their migrations.“Hoping to find a freer existence in the New World, [Charles] Carroll [the Settler] arrived in St. Mary’s City, capital of the colony of Maryland around 1689. He carried Lord Baltimore’s commission appointing him Attorney General of Maryland and a new family motto:Anywhere So Long As There Be Freedom.”https://charlescarrollhouse.org/the-carrolls/the-settlerIf we suppose that most of the migrants were not representative of the founders, the paradox can be resolved.

            I think the Catholic experience in England at the time was very exceptional. And to the extent that freedom of religion was the defining Maryland concept, it was a tremendous error. It was not long before Puritans – driven out from Virginia, which did not have such silly ideas – migrated to Maryland and promptly outlawed Catholicism wherever they ruled.Two little wars were fought to restore freedom, but Protestant immigrants very quickly took control of the colony and burned all the Catholic churches down, outlawed the Mass, and drove all remaining Catholics underground.At the time of the Revolution, the wealthiest man in the colony and signer of the Declaration, Charles Carroll, was prohibited from holding public office in the state because he was Catholic.Liberty is nonsense.On the other hand, we have this very prescient interaction between Carrol and Chase prior to the Revolution, where Chase was convinced a spicy argument would win the day:Chase: “We have the better of our opponents; we have completely written them down.”Carroll: “And do you think that writing will settle the question between us?”Chase: “To be sure, what else can we resort to?”Carroll: “The bayonet. Our arguments will only raise the feelings of the people to that pitch, when open war will be looked to as the arbiter of the dispute.”

            Could be just a difference in definitions. If “liberty” means one is free to come here for cheap land and make a good living for himself and his family while minding his own business, sure, the 15th-18th century immigrants sought “liberty”, and that is largely what the “Founders” wanted.
But the meaning has become perverted over the last couple centuries, exponentially so since Bush the Younger, into some caricature that must be forced on the rest of the world, at bayonet-point if need be.
I suspect our host is using the terms in it’s current connotation.

        In fairness, a candidate who ran on a platform of deregulating the health care rackets and restoring order to the legal system would have no audience.I am not so sure.  Part of the problem is candidacy is monopolized – only certain issues and candidates are allowed to be presented.  Chocolate or vanilla.  If you want strawberry, or something other than ice cream altogether, sorry – not on the menu.The internet and the DR have done a pretty good job of opening up the menu some, but running for office takes money and those who would run on a more locally focused platform don’t get any from TPTB.  To the contrary, TPTB move heaven and earth to destroy such candidates.  Trump’s 2016 victory was in large part due to his playing the immigration invasion issue. His 2020 “loss” was TPTB removing that from the menu (regardless of whether he actually delivered).

                And pundits will say he wants to throw granny off the cliff. The sad truth is any health care reform is going to impact the old negatively. I read somewhere 80% of health care costs is within 6 months of that person’s end of life.

                    Not necessarily. Medicare spending is somewhere around $900 bn, while Medicaid spending is somewhere around $700 bn, due to skyrocket with all the vibrancy being imported through the southern border.
Same old issue. Do you take it out on those who worked hard and paid taxes, or on those who contribute nothing positive to society?

Rough figures, the Medicare portion of my FICA is into 7 figures. Do I get any of that stolen money back?
Do whatever dollars I have to spend on medical care from my own pocket have to compete with government pensions and cadillac health care plans? Plans I paid for?

                    Chet:  Not just boomers.  Most people cannot bring themselves to do a rational cost/benefit analysis with regards to social issues.  Yes, I know one cannot put a definitive dollar amount on a human life, but one can consider the balance between the individual and the general welfare.  But today all I hear from all sides is “If it saves even one life . . . “

                        How would you benefit from making most boomers join the Free Shit Army? Most already have no retirement savings to speak of, so rather than SS, they go on Welfare and Section 8 housing and Medicaid. If you never got much higher than the factory floor, you would do better that way than relying on SS.
Or do you think their cunning plan is also to end those programs and let the cities burn?

        &gt; They did not want “freedom” or “liberty” and they did not give a damn about American values. They wanted cheap land and an opportunity to provide a better life for themselves and their family.My German ancestors bought land in the Midwest most of the locals thought was worthless, and turned it into prime farmland. One interesting aspect looking into the history is they spoke German for a very long time, but added English to their local schools and democratic norms to their local political processes to seem more American. It was basically keeping most of their own culture but showing they were not hostile to the more dominant Anglo ways.There is some truth to the idea of coming over for liberty, given the amount of people who came over to avoid religious persecution. My ancestors came partially to avoid the Bismarck Kulturkampf, but the entire mythos of “yearning to breathe free” is far overstated and doesn’t apply to 90+% of the people walking in.

        I surf over to the InstaPundit site all the time because it seems to be the only remaining mainstream cuck site that still lets you freely comment.  I’ve been finding it a little bit surprising that among the Con., Inc. crowd it is literally all Gaza and all “anti-Semitism” on campus 24/7.  I’m thinking that the Con., Inc. crowd is actually planning to go full “Libertarian” – not in the sense of taking up the same obsessions – but in the Z-man sense of standing forever on the sidelines.  Talking about unimportant issues like who the President of Harvard is in a vaguely right-wing sort of way lets the cucks posture as trying to advance conservatism while at the same time they avoid any meaningful confrontation with the Left over matters of real concern.

                And all of the white erasure that Gay spearheaded on the buildings, and entrenchment of the anti-white culture at Harvard will not be undone. In fact, given the new guy, it will probably get worse. He’ll focus on putting down what he has been hired to focus on. To get that, something will get bargained away. We all know what that will be.

                I find it kind of ironic that the Con., Inc. cucks’ biggest hero of all time – MLK – was also a serial plagarist.  Just think.  If the Gay woman hadn’t upset the Jews, Con., Inc. would probably be pushing to make Gay Day a national holiday.

        Will 2024 be the first AI presidential race, with each major candidate putting up his/her CGI avatar while handlers push code from command HQ? Sooner or later someone will get the bright idea that actual meat-and-bones pols are superfluous, and the ‘candidates’ will be nothing more than bullet points and policy papers made into 3D holograms.

        American society and government are indeed truly sick.  The empire has been a disaster, not only for us hoi poloi citizens, but for the citizens of the world.  I doubt there’s been more death and destruction showered over the planet than by the good old US of A – always cast as the good guy with the white hat, riding in to save the day – what a joke.As for Claudine Gay, the only reason I have even a tangential care is she is yet one more large example of a black that’s been elevated to a position of power far beyond any talent or ability.  There are hardly any blacks in any such positions who truly deserve it and where there aren’t multiple numbers of Whites who are more thoroughly deserving.  AA, the slobbering obeisance to blacks and the end of meritocracy has also been a huge disaster and another of the myriad examples as to why this country is so far off the rails.

            I get you should care more about the composition of your local school board rather than the presidente of Hazard, but there is a trickle down effect that makes the presdiente of Hazard not irrelevant.  For better but mostly worse, Hazard grooms the future movers and shakers of the US polity and culture to a large extent.  At least for now. At some point, the ridiculousness of their appointments will diminish its prestige if it hasn’t already. Sure, people will still understand you go for the connections, but no one takes a Hazard grad with the same seriousness they did in the past.  In particular if said grad is an obvious AA beneficiary.

                True. But how pathetic is it that it took the Gaydammerrung to make manifest what has been unavoidably obvious for at least the last forty years? One can only shake one’s head and chuckle ruefully at white obtuseness toward negroes and their lack of ability.

            Charles Dickens termed this obsession with the distant, “telescopic philanthropy” as typified by Mrs. Jellyby in “Bleak House”.  She ignored the teeming masses of local poor to focus on the plight of Africans.  Modern churchians do the same….the darker the recipient of their charity, the more intense a Jeebus reach around they believe they will receive.

                I think the “telescopic philanthropy” is more a function of pulling up ladders.
Lots of people in the middle class are far more capable and smart that in the upper class.  But upper class uses their power to tax them to death and swamp them them with illegals.
It’s the same impulse with the Mrs. Jellyby.  They want to lavish their charity on those they think will always worship them and never be any competition.

Maybe. Mrs. Jellby isn’t exactly elite. She’s more like the regular old church lady that gets up once a month and makes a plea to send aid and mission trips to Haiti. Though at least Mrs. Jellby practices what she preaches…

            While I am not overly optimistic by nature, I will admit the Gay firing has me giddy, as it sets the two most important Democrat constituencies against each other. Although the media is trying to blame conservatives, and the cucks are crowing as if they actually took her scalp, blacks, and especially black women, know who is responsible. Every black professional who owes her position to affirmative action (which is all of them) now know that their diversity points don’t mean shit if they criticize Jews.
The downstream consequences should be fun.

            fakemail:  Very well said.  Things won’t change until people have had enough of Bowling Alone, though.  We were so miserable and felt so psychologically besieged in liberal and diverse DFW that we sold it all and moved to a cabin in the woods.  Yes, I wistfully remembered all my German crystal when we had dinner (with plain wine glasses) at a neighbor’s home, but I would choose paper cups if it came down to it, so long as it comes along with feeling secure and comfortable in my humble home, and drinking water from our well.Besides, we gave my crystal to my husband’s oldest friend who’s getting remarried.  I don’t plan on hosting formal sit-down dinners up here.  Some ‘things’ are beautiful and reflective of White culture and history, but I now prioritize the makers and people over the product.

                    Lineman:  I don’t want to be a Debbie Downer or spam the comments but . . . sometimes I read here and despair.  So many clever people – and they can see what’s wrong – and yet they remain fixated on national elections and national college squabbles and international events and high finance and . . . You get where I’m going.It may have taken me too long, but I finally got to where – like Dorothy – I understand that I need to focus on my own backyard.  That means local only.  I have no impact on anything else, nor should I.  And yes, I loved my college years, but those were long ago, and that institution has long since been taken over by the enemy.  It is lost territory, as is most of AINO itself.People here just seem unwilling to disconnect from the very system they decry – they’re still sending their kids to colleges to be taught anti-White BS, still hoping for them to get ‘good jobs’ within the existing distorted system.  I know they only want what’s best for their families, but it’s all based on nothing truly changing.  It just seems so short-sighted to me.  And I have always been a ‘put your money where your mouth is’ kind of person.We each much make our own choices, but too many – of even our own folk – still think totally individually, not communally.  It saddens me.

        The story I tell people is of going to pick up some sheep from an older couple about a half an hour north of us.  When I asked about what political boundary they lived in (that let them keep livestock) they became a bit obtuse as it was clear they didn’t know.  However, knowing what kind of weirdos typically have this particular breed of sheep, I knew that if I asked them who the mayor of Kiev was that there was a good chance that they’d knowthat.

        Most likely these will be done using modern technology as he is incapable of forming a sentence now
And since the same people who were caught cloning participants in a Kamala Harris “virtual townhall” will be heavily involved, I can’t wait to see what bizarre glitches they come up with. Congrats, “America” — your 2024 Presidential campaign winner is Max Headroom.

                    Eh, the image manipulation algos are to a point where generating convincing propaganda for online consumption is child’s play. Seriously, give it a week and YOU could learn to train your own Mandy Patinkin AI model. A guy who is a competent Python programmer, is competent with Photoshop, and knew his away around DSLR photography could be a dangerous tool in the government’s employ.

                You don’t put the right negative prompts in, and too generous a CFG, the AI gets rather creative with human anatomy. Trying to get Stable Diffusion to generate a girl riding a bicycle is challenging.
