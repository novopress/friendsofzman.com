        DOGE reported that Stacy Abrams (failed GA gubernatorial candidate, state representative, sometime acts in Star Trek as the President of the United Federation of Planets and/or the whale in that time travel episode)…
set up an NGO that was funded to the tune of ten dollars and was slated to receive TWO BILLION before DOGE caught it.
This after GA leveled record fines against an NGO that admitted guilt to illegally funding her governor run.
The left can’t wrap their heads around the changes that need to happen. But even the right wingers are still stunned.

            Brandon’s giant spending bills were the Green New Deal the left wanted and it was set up as a slush fund for his friends. That’s why the left doesn’t see it, because they are the beneficiaries of it.
If the leftist system gives us enemies like Stacey Abrams, Alvin Bragg, Fani Willis, etc., then it’s not the worst thing….

(I wonder about the psychological mechanisms in play: (deep down) they have to know that what they do is criminal, but they have SO allowed themselves to be convinced…!)
Materialists on our side notwithstanding: ours is a spiritual battle.

                    That’s what I hated most about the lefties: not their obvious crookedness and the insanity of their policies, but the smug “We’re on the right side of history” smirking.

                Indeed, the National Review always opposed Trump because he wouldn’t surrender to the Bill Buckley faction or the Democrats, while we have tsk tsking from the likes of C.J. Hopkins and Naomi Wolff…It’s quite mysterious that defunding Democrat giveaways and total scams is suddenly anti-civilizational….Hmmm

            Hell I’m stunned, don’t know how to pidgen hole myself.I do know I am trapped behind enemy lines in a “deep blue” stateMy hope is when the team gets closer to being done stuffing the last century way of thinking hold outs into the dustbin. They find time to bleech the entire west coast of the corrupt filth that have had it in a choke hold.

                        There’s a lot of talk about secession and soft secession but what about the opposite of that? Is there anything in the constitution to prevent the expulsion of states from the union (thinking about the West coast)?

                        Actually, most people waiting on the Big One think it will be in SoCal or San Fran. In reality the plates there are fragmented into lots of pieces and prone to many small quakes. Even big quakes tend to have localized effects because the shattered plates don’t conduct energy well over long distances.The real Big One will be here in the Pacific Northwest. We don’t really have many small quakes. That’s because the plates are very strong and just build up stresses over centuries. Every 300 years or so, there’s a massive (9.0+) subduction fault slip that produces tsunamis that make it all the way across to Japan. The Japanese chroniclers always make a note of these “orphan tsunamis” because they get a tsunami without a local earthquake. The last one they recorded was on Jan 1, 1700. So we’re somewhat overdue for this. Just to make all this much worse, the hipsters LOVE them some old unreinforced masonry apartment building. So… lots of dead hipsters. That may be the only bright spot. I’m just hoping I can get out before this happens. Seattle and Portland are already uninhabitable for “social” reasons but soon they may also have a nice Hiroshima hellscape factor too. It’s gonna be great 🙁

                    Some of the people out here do like it the way it is. But many of us others are suspicious about whether they actually constitute a majority. The most that can be confidently said is that Team D has seized the institutions of power and has changed the rules in ways that make it difficult to dislodge them.We’re hopeful that starving the Blob at the national level will have some trickle down effect on the situation locally. Dissident voices do seem to have been emboldened, but here in WA our newly-elected governor is pushing ahead with Starmer-level insults to common sense.

                        Edward Ring has said/written a lot about California. He is at California Policy Center. Very smart guy.
He has an article titled “Lords of Scarcity”. It explains the massive challenge of changing Calif. It is worth the read.
The people in power like the way things are to clarify. The middle class who can afford it are in TX. The rest are unhappy.

                            California could easily be changed by splitting off the Bay Area from the rest of it. Turn it into another DC, District of California. Then you would see normality rain in the rest of California. Even LA where they are not as nuts as they are in the Bay Area.
The Bay Area has too much education, too many brains, too much money, too many foreigners and too little common sense.

                I’m stuck in Oregon for now and my feeling is that Oregon will actually be the West Coast’s version of North Korea. California and Washington will “fall” before Oregon does simply because they have a more diversified economy and, quite honestly, smarter people. A lot of the techbros backing Trump are from the Bay Area after all.Oregon is ruled by a gynocracy of old White Karens who maintained the nation’s longest mask mandates during the Great Coof. It’s “economy” consists basically of the bloated state government and lots of businesses and NGOs that are totally dependent on it. There’s also a large number of federal government workers and associated parasites. If Musk and Trump are even half serious about this DOGE stuff the entire employed workforce of the state will be three 90 year old loggers living in the hills. The hipsters with trust funds might hang around for all that top notch weed but my feeling is that state’s slow bleed of population will turn into a massive spurting hemorrhage. For myself I’m looking for a remote job that will allow me to get out of here.

        It is about how conflicts between great powers will be settled in the future.
Thats true, but a large reason for the conflict was the (((usual suspects))) wanting to get their grubby little hands on the resources, including farmland.

                Oh, they’ve got an answer for that. They don’t intend to get behind any plows themselves. Instead they will rely on the same things they do here. Impoverish the locals to the point where they will take any job and bring in low-wage, low-IQ migrant trash from shithole countries to do the actual farm labor.This is actually their plan for all of Europe in fact. Europeans need to stay alert because even when their politicians start talking about re-industrializing and reversing some of the “green” insanity, they will probably still be plotting to fill all the re-opened factories with Arabs and Africans.

            Yes, though the idea was pretty far-fetched…Russia’s natural resources are far greater than Ukraine’s, and Rand Corp even released a paper advocating  breaking Russia up into five countries, but it’s common knowledge that the nukes would fly long before that could happen…and eastern Ukraine is actually Russian….

                With the exception of the far western oblasts, which spent much time historically under Austria/Hungary and are greatly “Polonized”, ALL of Ukraine is Russian. And while I’m not a linguist, I submit that the lingua franca spoken in the Ukraine is (bastardized) Russian, just as the Scots (hitherto) spoken in Scotland (or the patois spoken in Jamaica, for that matter!) is bastardized English.

                    The emergence of a distinct Ukrainian language began with the emergence of the Polish-Lithuanian state in the 14th century. With this development, the Ukraine–literally, the borderland–was detached from the Russian appanage principalities and the budding Muscovite state. But yes, Ukrainian and Russian spring from identitcal roots.

                        Sure – historical precedents prompted divergence. But can two languages that are (near universally) mutually intelligible be said to be “distinct?”
There are “linguists” who maintain that Scots is (was) a “distinct” language, but is it?
PerMy SmartAlek Robot Pal:
“The status ofScotsas adistinct language or a dialect of Englishis a topic of debate among linguists and historians. The answer largely depends on how one defines a “language” versus a “dialect,” as well as historical, political, and cultural factors.”
Historical…political…cultural…hmm…alas, whatever chauvinisms might motivate the “borderlanders” of Little Russia….

            There may have been some players who thought they could turn the war into profit, once it got started, but it got started because the arrogant idiots who were running the West thought Putin was a bully and a homophobe, a racist and a transphobe, and they had their Uncle Sam who would make him back down because Uncle Sam had sanctions and a money printing machine.  That’s about the level of sophistication of the leaders of Germany, France and Great Britain.

                            You should have reminded her of the pre-meditated genocide of the entirety of the people and the animals of Canaan after they came out of the wandering. Remind her that her people did that because God said to.
The sad part is, a bunch of them remember history from thousands of years back, but only the side of it that confirms the myth that bad people do bad things to them just because the other people are bad – and jealous.

                                God wanted them to wipe out everyone because a)those people had already gone very bad, including child sacrifice and b)He knew if they didn’t follow orders, they would fall into child sacrifice themselves.It turns out they didn’t follow the orders anyway. The Israelites fell into child sacrifice anyway. The end of the wandering in the desert is the only moment God orders genocide. Most of the time after that it’s the Israelites being exiled (or destroyed) themselves.

        “In reality he is going to be sat down by Trump subordinates and told he has been demoted.”It couldn’t have happened to a nicer bloke. Just kidding. Starmer is a scumbag, one of Biden’s bum boys and he’s going to get his comeuppance. He’s going to leave DC utterly dazed. And it’s more than business for Trump: he won’t have forgotten that Starmer sent a team to help that Harris woman in her campaign. All these bum boys of Biden — Starmer, Macron, and Scholz — are going to get kicked in the balls.With regard to change, the new rules and the new game aren’t yet quite clear, not quite in focus. It looks like Team Trump has realised that unipolarity is down the toilet and multipolarity is the new emerging reality. There’s an insightful piece by Dmitry Trenin at the RT site today:https://www.rt.com/news/612823-trenin-russias-long-term-play/

            If anything, Trump is being far more magnanimous than the typical business executive, let alone mob boss, would be to these knuckleheads. The UK elites actively connived  against Trump in the Steele dossier episode. The Ukraine crowd set up the Vindman/impeachment affair. The Germans laughed in his face when he tried to teach them a few home truths about defense and energy policy. I’m frankly amazed that he hasn’t been harsher.

            Scholz is on his way out as chancellor, as Germany holds federal elections on Sunday and the CDU (Scholz is SPD, “Social Democrats”) is slated to win. Their top dog Friedrich Merz is just as clueless as Scholz was though. A former Blackrock executive in Germany, he was even way more hawkish on Ukraine than Scholz, who at least in this regard did a fair enough job of always stalling as best he could.Merz by contrast is the archetypical cuckservative. So, in style, he has repeatedly and solemnly announced that under his leadership there will always be a “firewall” between his party and the AfD, championed by Musk and to and extent Vance. Against this background, he has no other choice than to set up an inherently unstable coalition government with the SPD (under new leadership) and/or the Greens.Upshot: Germany’s downward trajectory is going to continue for a while.

I agree. That decline will continue indefinitely. it might have been arrested if the AfD took over the reins of power but I don’t see that at the moment.

                Germany is so screwed. The great irony is that in trying desperately to block the return of the “far” right, they are using exactly the same kind of methods that have always been seen as far-right: censorship, banning political opponents, arresting people for speaking out against the government. You have to admit, it’s quite funny really.

                I think the first order of business once Russian and the US straighten out issues, and if the US allows it, Germany and Russian should repair the Nordstream pipeline and get back to affordable energy and subsequent industry. I’m assuming piped NG from a few hundred miles away is cheaper than LNG from the US or elsewhere. Does anybody know that difference in price should Germany begin trading with Russia again. I asked Leo, Braves AI, but it don’t seem to know sheeet. “Ok, Nord stream piped gas to Germany until either the US or Ukrainians blew it up. What was the cost per unit of this gas to Germany before the West destroyed that infrastructure”I know the EU is all into green energy so what if Russian advertised this energy like “No LNG….go for ANG-“All Natural Gas.”

        All too true.Over my career, I watched four formerly successful companies die. What seemed to be the turning point in the end that pushed them into the abyss was marked by an increasingly erratic and volatile management. They’d point the corporate train in a new direction and hit the gas. You had the choice of either getting on the team, or getting the hell off it. We’d get emotionally troubled girl bosses, and incompetent vibrants and pajeets that were going to “save the company” with far sighted new strategies that would set the market on fire and position us as industry leaders. And when they crashed and burned, they’d be replaced. Once I saw an attempted return to normalcy but it was too little, too late. The company would be mothballed or bought out. If we got bought out, massive layoffs were instituted and new people were brought in to do the job right… or continue the folly.Trump and his teams have a massive job ahead of them.

Got it.I can only think of my mechanic who charges upwards of 120/Hour. Heiswas the anti-vibrant. I’ve been using him for going on 30 years now. He has no expression. When I ask, “really, that much,” deadpan he replies “that what it is.” I recently went down for an inspection and ran into one of his past mechanics. Past I say because he is gone. Mechanic informs me that the man who started the 2, now multiple bay garage, the anti-vibrant, is gone. At mid-fifties he sold the garage to a competitor for 8M. I started coming to him when he just started out and now he’s vibrant. Enjoying New England in the summer and fishing the Gulf in the winter.

        Trump’s actions are illuminating how the Ukraine war was a strategic debacle initiated by childish arrogant actors in the West.  Putin had all the negotiating leverage three years ago.  Mature, serious people who know how awful, destructive and wasteful war is, would have negotiated in good faith to avoid the conflict.  At the very worst the West would have given Putin all he wanted and left the negotiating table humilated.  There was NEVER any chance Ukraine could win a war against Russia.Now, three years on, tens of thousand dead, hundred of billion dollars up in smoke, Putin will get all he wanted and the West will leave the negotiating table AND the battlefield humiliated.  That’s what childish arrogance get you.

            The genius of Trump right now is that he is forcing the Left to defend the indefensible. The Left now have to fight him with the slogan “War is good; peace is awful!” It’s like Rules for Radicals in reverse.

        Youtube for some reason recommended a video to me where Bernie Sanders whines about Trump’s “treasonous” communications with the “Russian dictator”. It has over 2 million views and thousands of comments, many of which are demanding impeachment etc. The old delusions are still alive and well.

            Of course, do we not all agree the Dem/Leftist base is a hard 30% of the population?  Did not Harris obtain 48% of the popular vote?  These delusions never “grow old”.  They are part and parcel of our current electorate—and will grow worse.

                It hit 40% during the Obama years. That was his approval rating when he was doing nothing that leftists wanted (except being a Democrat, maintaining patronage, etc.), neocon abroad and domestically a dystopian corporate technocrat, giving everything to finance and the “tech bros.” Nobody wanted that. 40%.As a matter of demographic fact, it’s more than 40% now. We don’t know how much more, because everything is bullshit. We do know how the other halftalks, because unlike us they’re free to do it. The electorate is far more extreme than the Party. The propaganda worked better than even their most cynical operator expected. Theiraverage voteris a genocidal maniac.

We have but two advantages, this one, and their impulsivity. If they could have kept it in their pants, they could have spiked the football by now after victory rather than just doing it for the feelz. I still wouldn’t bet against them, but the spread is narrower now. The dopamine rushes of rage and cruelty must be something.

This is the sex that brainwashes the next crop, K – college. It’s ouroboric, a closed loop. The schools and universities are little more than feminist and marxist training camps.
The U.S. can disempower the Prog Politburo or wait until the bloodtide returns. Right now, the nation lacks the demographic will to do what is necessary. Too many of the citizenry benefit monetarily, from feminism especially. It is a cunning, calculated, time-tested instrument of the enemy.

                and will grow worse.It certainly will. It’s important to notice that Trusk has actually pulled the revolution trigger. I don’t think many of us even thought he would do anything like this. For myself, I just thought we’d get 4 years of “not-Biden-Harris”. Revolutions pivot around fundamental divisions in society, many of which are rooted in biology. This is why they always have a component of warfare. Our country was founded in a revolutionary war after all.Downthread, Ostei says “all is permissible, when there is no longer any common ground”. I think this has finally happened. The clean break with the past (and with many of our “fellow citizens”) has begun and cannot be reversed. This is what we had hoped for and feared at the same time! Things may get even crazier than anyone had thought possible just a month ago.

One man’s assassin is another man’s patriotic hero.  And so it is. As has been discussed here before, one needs to abandon one’s time honored virtues to fight in the modern area.  Re-establish/revisit new/old virtues after you prevail in the struggle—your enemy will do no less.

                    Quite true. And you can only arrive at the point where, from a moral perspective, all is permissible, when there is no longer any common ground, opponents have become enemies, and you couldn’t care less whether your enemies live or die. In fact, you might prefer the latter.

            YouTube’s algorithms are almost certainly designed to correct “wrongthink”. My viewing habits (gun channels, hard science, motorsports, occasional based political stuff, Russian pop music like Garik Sukachev) must have suggested that I likely had the wrong thoughts about Ukraine. Out of the blue, they started feeding me videos from these channels that seemed to have appeared recently and had lots of rah, rah, Ghost of Keeeev, Russians fighting with shovels, etc… I’d click “do not recommend videos from this channel” and soon enough, a new channel with the same garbage would appear in my feed.

        It’s amazing how much mileage the left/regime/etc. got out of pointing, shrieking, and saying “wow, just wow.” Especially in Trump’s first term, but they even do it when they held power. Even the slightest bit of opposition to the craziest agenda was met with “wow, just wow” or some variation thereof. It’s like the fake opposition of the conservacucks saw “wow, just wow” as a signal that it was time to fall in line and did so.Trump is showing now all you have to do is shrug and say “don’t care, no taxpayer money for illegals lmao” or “tough sh*t, now you don’t get your congestion pricing in NYC lol”.

                It would certainly be nice if he did, especially on “immigration” cases.  Trump should simply say that we are not deporting illegal aliens, but repelling invaders and the courts have no jurisdiction over military border defense actions. Judges, remember, are lawyers whose political connections put them in black robes.

                        Not only that, but if Trump does not *crush* the Hydra–*now,* while he has the power to do so–it will eventually destroy him and his entire family. And by “destroy” I mean destroy. Bank on it.

                He’ll ignore the courts until he gets what he wants—which is SCOTUS decision and then precedent.  I believe people on the Right think “we’re winning”.  It’s all sound and fury.  Nothing is further from the truth.  We are skirmishing for position and the decisive battle will be in the SCOTUS.  Since legislation in a divided Congress (divided ideologically) is impossible, SCOTUS is the only power center left in which to establish lasting gains.  Until they rule, all conservative gains are ephemeral.

                    I agree, except on Congress being ideologically divided, unless cuckoldry is an ideology.  They’ve been passing these spending bills funneling money to leftist causes for decades.  It doesn’t matter who is in charge, the left always gets their (our) money.
I agree that all the celebrations are premature.  So far everything Trump has ordered has a corresponding lawsuit filed in the districts leftists have the most judges.  SCOTUS is a long shot and will take years even if they accept the case.

To steal from sportsball, Trump needs to flood the zone. How many leftist judges could there be? Get that robo-pen going, Mr. President. Order a million more robo-pens to be built. The first judge who “rules” that the President can’t issue executive orders will be the death of the judiciary.

                            That’s exactly the plan.  One thinks SCOTUS rules are “years” in the future, no they are not.  SCOTUS will move when the pressure mounts via the enormous amount of EO’s and the carrying out of those regardless of lower court TRO’s.
Ordinarily, SCOTUS hates getting into the political fray, but the collapse of judicial oversight will force their hand.  So far, Trump is playing Mr. Nice Guy.  He will get worse.

                                That is unbelievably rare.  It has to go through the lower courts first.  All this takes years.  I’m pretty they have to go through a ruling and then 2 appeals before they can appeal to SCOTUS.
Of course, I do hope that the conservatives on the court will be activists like we’ve had for decades with left wing activist judges.  Taking up a case right from the lower courts issuing the TROs would be awesome.  I just don’t think the conservatives have it in them.

            Once you’ve rejected the Left’s moral system in toto, you are then free to shrug your shoulders or even–dare I say it?–laugh in their insipid faces. In point of fact, Trump has demolished large sections of that moral system. He has functioned as an ideological wrecking ball. And nothing is more important than that.

                    That’s what I was about to write too, Alz. He’s broken the spell. Sure, the Woke crap will continue, just like sh*t still stinks out the room long after it’s been cleared up. But the difference is that the Emperor’s naked body can never be unseen. I have the misfortune to work on the sidelines of many left-wing organisations and you can see this in action. They are doubling down on Woke, but no-one takes it seriously anymore. And if they dare block you from getting a promotion by giving it to a DIE tick-boxer, you can now challenge it and have a good chance of winning. The spell has indeed been broken.

            Technically we are now Progressive Libertarian Traditionalists. Progressive because we are radicals who want the system overturned, and question globalism, liberalism, etc. Libertarian because we want gov’t accountability and its responsibilities diffused, and a reigned-in MIC. Traditionalist because we recognize demographics, sex, race, and HBD, and a whole lot of us are religious as well.

        My concern with regards to the two classes of people. It appears every member of Congress has been benefiting from all of the corruption. Moving forward to a more transparent and honest federal government is not in their best interest. They are going to do all they can to undermine a change in the status quo. They have shown they can not be trusted. They may unite in secret to keep the cash cow going no matter what they say, The unifying ideology of the uni-party is self interest. Wheres mine?

            When everybody does it, it’s no longer corruption, it’s a “perq”.  You know you’re screwed when some of the biggest crooks are on “your side”.  Abraham bargained with God—from 50 righteous persons down to 10 righteous persons to save Sodom and Gomorrah.  He failed.

            Part of the reason why the US has been growing for the past 15 years and the EU was stagnating is because the US debt has been growing at much higher rate than EU’s. (Compare Euro area to US charts at trading Economics, for example) This rapid acceleration of debt is one of the things the new administration is trying to address, but it’s unlikely they will succeed without sacrificing growth.

                The whole rapprochement with Russia has to do with FedGov’s debt. It lessens the attractiveness of a new BRICS currency, especially if (when?) the sanctions against Russia are removed and Russia’s frozen/seized assets are returned to her; when the US dollar returns to its role as a currency rather than a weapon.

                Europe is stagnating because they have a bloated un-elected EU bureaucracy and all the regulation that comes with it.  They have brought in floods of low quality unassimalable third worlders and allowed them to settle in their lands.  The EU has fully embraced the Green religion which makes energy very expensive.  Debt has very little to do with it.

                    Yes, that is another reason for the stagnation, but the numbers don’t lie. You can easily check for your self. A lot of US GDP “growth” is financed by monster government deficits.
The third world invasion is terrible, but the US is suffering from the same fate.
And lastly, it’s also about the mentality. Americans are much more business oriented and open minded when it comes to money than Europeans, but that is besides my original point.

                I don’t think the official numbers are trustworthy. They give the numbers they want. If you look at the increase in M2 and the growth in the DOW it has the appearance that it is all artificial growth and really just inflation. The countries 401k plans all support the price of the stock market; they have no where else to go. We have the reserve currency with our petro dollar and that has allowed us to create this beautiful piece of fiction. I have no idea what our real growth rate is or what an accurate GDP would be. The real inflation rate is also a mystery. Trillions in deficit spending every year can hide a lot of rot in the system. What does our economy look like when you stop the trillions in deficit spending? Probably not much..

The echoes of Nixon are deafening.
People have forgotten that Nixon called for a New American Revolution.  It’s not clear what this would have entailed because Vietnam and Watergate.
But the thinking behind it was that things had gone sideways and needed to be set right.  In tone if not specifics, it was MAGA half a century early.

            Interesting. I can only assume that the New American Revolution sought to draw fuel from the Silent Majority just as MAGA draws it from the Deplorables. And in both cases, the target to be ultimately if not proximately destroyed was/is the cultural depravity of the New Left. In the case of MAGA, governmental efficiency is largely a fig leaf for that much more essential objective.

            Sizable percentage (30%? 40? more?) is slave to the narrative. It was established over the last several years that this was a war between Good and Evil, between Freedom and Democracy against, well, I’m not sure exactly what, but it was something bad on the other side. Anyhow, there hasn’t been a slow narrative change for these people to adjust to, they are being smacked in the face by a reality that they haven’t been conditioned to.

Stammerer makes about as many decisions as Tater Joe did, i.e., none.Treat him accordingly.‘They are still doing the “If we use our power then weare no better than the Democrats” act.’Cowards and rent-seekers.  Fat jowly manlings.Once there was an evil Queen and a dominated, weak King.  The Queen followed a pagan, woke religion, and promptly set to slaughtering most of the good men in the land.A friend of those men then lured the Queen’s leading servants to an isolated place, made a display of power, and slaughtered all 450 of them.  It was a good day to be a detritus feeder.Then his buddies arranged the defenestration of the Queen and hunted down and obliterated the entire families of the King and Queen.  God approved of it all.  Same God we got today.

                        Read Frazer’s The Golden Bough.  The reality is that ritual sacrifice of males in antiquity was much more common.
That’s why the rite was/is called the ‘Killing of the King’ and not the ‘Killing of the Queen’.

                Wild. Solomon’s vast kingdom, yet not one coin, not one pottery shard has ever been found from it. Jericho, 10,000 years old, yet archaeologists digging have never found evidence of a wall.
Both Jerusalem and Jericho were likely hamlets of about 500 people at the time great events were ascribed. “Winners” write the history, etc.
Myth is more like an inspiration with seeds of history. Aesop’s animals didn’t really talk, and earthquakes weren’t really Hephaestus hammering at his forge. Lessons can be taken, but receiving moral lessons from murderous invaders massacring a peaceful town (Jericho) does give one pause.

                    This phrase is solid archeology, geology, and any field science: “The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.”“Solomon’s vast kingdom, yet not one coin, not one pottery shard has ever been found from it. Jericho, 10,000 years old, yet archaeologists digging have never found evidence of a wall. Both Jerusalem and Jericho were likely hamlets of about 500 people at the time great events were ascribed. “Winners” write the history, etc.”Evidence of even great and long standing civilizations are easily lost to time. The Egyptian civilization is a good example, because we both have extensive records and we don’t. The pyramids were covered with beautiful limestone, which has all but disappeared. Most of the buried treasures and even the bodies are gone. People steal things, reuse them, they get buried/washed away, and they melt down metal for new coins/jewelry/objects. Please remember we couldn’t even read the writing of one of the world’s great civilizations again until the 19th century.The idea that Jerusalem and Jericho were hamlets of 500 people is mostly atheist “scholars” wishing to ignore the direct evidence of ancient historical documents. It is far less scholarly/rigorous to come up with some random number with no evidence than simply accept ancient historical accounts at face value. It’s the best we’re going to do, because no civilization is “required” to leave anything behind to prove it’s existence. The existence of such document alone itself is good enough. They also should have been lost to time.

You see, they are liars, and fantasists, who stole other peoples’ stories and promise grandiose desires they cannot deliver.
But, I’m not going to Heaven. That is closed to yours truly, for reasons. So I will be GOD-DAMNED if I’m told to sacrifice our women to these Hell-spawn or told they’ll bring Jesus. I will not take moral correction from these hapless creatures.They misled our women, not vice versa.

                            I annoyed one other poster the other day by speaking as though Christianity had one doctrine and one view. As a practicing Catholic, it does. I just happen to live in a Protestant country which assumes it does not. The Bible to me is both history and book from which liturgy (Mass/Sunday service/prayer) is derived. It is not open to private interpretation (from a theological view) nor it is to be read in two sentence snippets with an accompanying one hour lecture. The teaching and practice of the faith reside in a living institution, not a book many people appear to be trying to reinvent the wheel from.That was the long way to say I agree with you on Biblical interpretation. The evangelicals who think “bless Israel” is the way to go have it wrong. Ironically they may be engaging in the long way in the child sacrifice that is so horrific in the OT. When I first reverted to Catholicism, I thought Protestants knew the Bible. I will carve out an exception for Lutherans, but as a general rule they don’t. It surprised the heck out of me. Broadly speaking, what’s happening is that pastors raised in the same tradition of partial reading lead others through tiny readings and grandiose ideas. They aren’t reading the whole looking for themes. They quite often fail at simple reading comprehension. I follow a Catholic YouTube channel who primarily is carefully explaining word definitions and grammar out of Scripture (Really!).There’s nothing I can do about the US’s inability to read Scripture. Scripture is difficult, no matter what Protestants flatter themselves with. As someone who returned to the faith after a million questions, I can only encourage reading Scripture in the light of that God is just and merciful, but that ALL people are wanting, included “God’s chosen” The early OT assumes that POV particularly. It’s too bad people don’t much beyond there, because the later OT (particularly the deutrocanoncials) are much more readable in that sense.

                            “But, I’m not going to Heaven. That is closed to yours truly, for reasons.”My friend, a love of truth is a love of God. Bishop Fulton Sheen quipped “How God will judge my life I know not, but I trust he will see me with mercy and compassion. I am only certain there will be three surprises in Heaven. First of all, I will see some people whom I never expected to see. Second, there will be a number whom I expected who will not be there. And – even relying on God’s mercy – the biggest surprise of all may be that I will be there.”God bless.

                    Yeah, Amen.  We lose the big picture in search for trivial aspects of correct historical narrative.  Yet, time after time the few folk here knowledgeable continue to cite the Books wisdom which never fails to instruct. The power of “myth” remains strong.

        This applies to the rats who fled the sinking ship under the guise of being anti-woke or of being a populist who still loves the working class that the Dems abandoned.Joel Kotkin is one of many such slime balls. Here he is doing exactly what Z talked about. Americans need to keep and import more immigrants because … … surprise! We need them for the GDP!!These people are so clueless. He celebrates that 78% of the blue collar workforce will be SouthAmerIndian by 2030. This is the same old magic soil upon which GDP must go up at all costs. We have to import a new nation to save the nation. We have to win the Cold War to become Gay Race Communists! We have to fight the GWOT to get more mosques and Muslims at all levels of government. We have to import Asia to defeat Asia! The 20th century has to end. It just has to end. Finality is when every last huckster of these absurd contradictions and outright lies is counting themselves lucky to be on a plane back to their foreign domiciles and cherished homelands.White boys are fucking pissed and sick to death of this shit. These slime bags’ come uppance is coming. Send the Squatamalans to Israel. They need the GDP growth!!!! So sick of this warmed over managerialism on the, “new Right.”https://americanmind.org/salvo/immigration-the-american-way/

                Indeed. But this seeming antinomy gets to the heart of what’s Left and Right. It seems to me, for example, that conservation of a sort must be fundamental to the Right. But what to conserve is of the essence. Clearly, multiculti, homo marriage, et al, are not to be conserved. But if not such things, what? I suppose it must be the deep structures–culture, customs, language, thenatio. And anything violating the deep structures must be persecuted without pity.Similarly, working toward fundamental change is a huge part of being a Leftist. But not change to Leftist policy and political innovations. Those things must be conserved. Rather, they must do everything they can to obliterate traditional culture and customs, the language and thenatio. That is why the Left, and particularly the postmodern New Left, placed such a premium on conquering the instruments of culture and education. They could use those ramparts, not only to directly crush the traditional, but to enlist thenatio(effectively white people) in the destruction of their own culture, customs, language and demography. It has been a diabolical enterprise. And we are only now seeing a concerted resistance to it.

        One analogy is that Trump-the-developer has agreed to take on the project of renovating a dilapidated piece of real estate, but the place is infested with termites. And nothing he does can work until he first gets rid of the termites. The termites are unanimous in their opposition to being eliminated from the premises, even though they’re running out of wood to gnaw on. The new owners would like this problem solved as fast as possible. Who are you going to call?

        IMO, the politics of the 20th century weren’t that different from those of the 19th. We’ve been in a rut for too long. Rock on.

        I’m starting to think covid wasn’t from Ft. Detrix or wuhan.  I think it might have come from Europe.  At this point i don’t think China runs the Democrats, though they may help, i think its the Europeans.  And i’m starting to think they may be our biggest enemies.  Thoughts?

            Whether Europe directly runs the Democrats or not, the #1 foreign policy concern of the American left/Democrats/progressives/baizuo, since longer than I have been alive, is how they are perceived by their European fellow travelers.

                Stocks took a big tumble December 2018, and powell started cutting rates in spring of 2019, quit QT summer of 2019, Repo market begins to explode Fall of 2019.  Does anyone remember the big Euro banks having issues that year?  This is the only thing i could find with a quick search, perhaps they blowing up the Repo market and that is why JP morgan was demanding 10% for an overnight loan?  Remember how not hysterical democrats were when covid first started, almost like they hadn’t been given the script yet?

            You (not you… but you know what I mean) are your biggest enemies. Look within. True catharsis requires that the blood sacrifice come from your neighbours.
America’s great failing is that it constantly dodges this and washes itself in the blood of others. Never seems to work.
