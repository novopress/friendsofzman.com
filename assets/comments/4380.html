        […] The recent revelations about the Clinton slush fund has reminded  everyone that the very worst said about the Clintons is the tip of the  iceberg. There’s always more slime under the next stone.  […]

        I also wonder if  fake indian has something in her back-story that could not withstand the vetting.  Maybe faux native Americanism isn’t the only skeleton in her teepee.

            Her cozy relationship with bankers would be a problem. She’s also a bit slow-witted. Giving a prepared speech she is fine, but off-the-cuff she’s tough to take. She’s simply not very good at campaigning.The truth is her husband is the brains in the family. Without him and the fake indian routine, Warren would have spent her career fixing parking tickets at a strip mall office. He’s the guy Harvard wanted and they offered her a spot as an inducement. But, she had to do the fake indian thing to make it work.Like Mario Cuomo, Warren is a gold plated phony, but she knows it. She can work the faculty lounge populism act into retirement, bank a bunch of money and avoid the hassle of defending her hypocrisy.

        That is the best explanation of why Fake Indian likely won’t run that I have read.

        I’ll get laughed at, I’m sure, but I think, and have thought for some time, that Jerry Brown is going to enter the race at some time, and he’ll be the nominee.  I know, sounds ludicrous, and probably is, but it’s a hunch.  I hope I’m wrong, but I really think he’s going to jump in, and he’d have a better chance of getting the nomination than Hillary.It’s interesting to me (and others) that there are no young Democrats coming up the ranks.  Lots of relatively young GOP candidates, but nothing in the Demo ranks.  Speaks volumes about what has been written here and elsewhere about the ‘death’ of the Democratic Party.
