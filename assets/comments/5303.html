        Trump is “the leader of a revolt that I doubt he understands.”
Well said.  But then, I suppose few of his many supporters understand it either.  This whole Trump business is really about the way the elites have made people feel for decades, not about what anyone thinks.
Come to think of it, it’s just possible Trump may have a pretty good understanding after all.  He turns any interview, debate, discussion into a one-way conversation on topics which Americans feel strongly about.  No thoughts, no ideology, just feelings.

        Every age views itself as unique, special, enlightened. But the melody lingers on. All societies tend to oligarchy. Oligarchies become insular. They don’t see the ground shifting beneath their feet.
The revolution, be it bloody or by the ballot box, is never orderly nor coherent. The manifesto is, by nature, radical and seldom survives intact. The lucky few, the United States being the prime example, maintain continuity – but the new order is always a surprise.

        Trump “towers” over Bush and the rest of the field.  It looks like boys trying to play against a man.  I know, I know Trump is (fill in the blank) but still……..  Trump is saying what is on the minds of many Americans – albeit in a voice that is, well, bombastic and sometimes incoherent but he is saying it.  The points in his immigration manifesto resonate with citizens who have been left behind in the rush to embrace “dreamers” of every stripe. The silent majority is being voiced by the loud renegade.  I kind of like it.

            I was in a bar outside of Boston when Trump was visiting Norwood Mass this weekend. The whole place was glued to the TV’s. I was quite surprised by it, but I suspect a fair number of the people were not fans, just curious of the spectacle. One of the people with me does not vote, but registered so he can vote for Trump. He’s a guy who I’d put down as indifferent to social issues, but very patriotic. Former soldier, small businessman, family guy. Gave up on politics a long time ago thinking it did not matter. I don’t think immigration resonates with him at all. It’s just the raw patriotism. My friend think it’s time to shake things up and get the country back on track.

        “Because he knows Wall Street, and because he doesn’t need its money to campaign, it seems like he could actually fight his fellow elites and win. He won’t, of course, but it matters a great deal how he loses.”
This is an example of the smugness that makes normal people hate the elites. My immediate reaction was to hope fervently that Trump wins. He’ll probably be co-opted once he’s in the White House, but the shock waves rippling through elitesville from election day to inauguration day would be a joy to watch.

        I would never have thunk Trump or even the Republican party.  But he’s the horse, I don’t think he’s crazy or bad, so I guess we better ride him.  It will be fun and the possible upside is big,  downside small.
