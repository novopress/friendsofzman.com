        The freedom of association is incompatible with civil rights existing  between people instead of between the state and citizens, which is the original meaning.

        The Muslima is wrong; the hijab is not a symbol of modesty but of submission. I have a policy about Moslem workers of any kind. If they identify themselves as Moslem by their dress, I will not have any contact with them because I do not conduct business with slaves. They are slaves to Islam.
Did anyone read about Target stores in Minnesota allowing their Moslem cashiers to not have to wait on customers purchasing pork products? Coming to a state near you, I’m sure. When it reaches New Hampshire I will cease shopping at Target.

        “Then I learned I was not hired by Abercrombie because I wear a head scarf, which is a symbol of modesty in my Muslim faith,” she added. “This was shocking to me.”
How did she find out?  Is there some law now stating you have to explain to people why they are not being hired?  Just don’t hire her and toss her application into file 13.

        I admit it: I am biased, I discriminate, I am prejudiced.  I don’t go to other racial enclaves, I don’t travel to or through blue states if I can help it, I don’t agree with forced diversity, or diversity in general.  I believe in traditional gender roles,  I guess I am a bad person.

        More than one person I know avoids direct contact with muslims if possible, including not shopping in muslim-owned stores. It is the right of disassociation — though not one trumpeted these days — and certainly in the case of not shopping in a place where the consumer may suspect a percentage of profits is channeled to certain groups in the middle-east, going elsewhere merely adds to their own inconvenience.One person I know of even said he is puzzled by seeing muslim women in full black burkas walking round western malls because patently there is nothing there for them: all their clothes are bought in muslim-owned shops. He concludes they are there because it is necessary for a representative of the one true faith to be seen as a reminder to all the dissolute buying brightly coloured garments.If any of this got out though I expect it wouldn’t be long before some crackpot law is passed demanding that so much of one’s shopping is done with ‘minorities’ even in places where such people are fast becoming a non-minority.As you say, rules are layered on laws and padded out with regulations to ensure that we obey. If that is not enough (and it rarely is as it doesn’t work)  then expect a heavy dose of moral equivalence being tossed in to make sure that we bend our knee as required.
