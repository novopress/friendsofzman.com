        I quit Facebook recently. It was starting to creep me out in ways I didn‚Äôt care to analyze. A gut thing. Your staring at your fellow man comment got me thinking. Too much looking at what others want you to see of them is not a good thing. Depressing and alienating, as are all co-dependent relationships.

            I think that‚Äôs part of it. It is a performance by people who like to perform, but maybe shouldn‚Äôt be on stage. Every once in a while I look at one of the video bloggers and I find the whole thing weird and unsettling. It‚Äôs just not normal and I don‚Äôt want it to feel normal.

            Familiarity or repetition breed contempt.  It almost has nothing to do with the object. Loved classic rock growing up.  But if I hear Back in Black one more time I‚Äôm going to stab myself.

They don‚Äôt dig deep, they‚Äôll play Pink Floyd‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnother Brick in the Wall‚Äù a thousand times, but never ‚ÄúCareful With that Axe Eugene‚Äù or ‚ÄúWish You Were Here Part II‚Äù.Nope, just crap, crap and more crap. It‚Äôs what the paymasters want, I guess. A ‚Äúclassic rock‚Äù ‚Äòtop 40‚Äô frozen in time, for ever and ever. This way our masters can teach the young that all their parents did was get drunk in rural bars and listen to ‚ÄòFree Bird‚Äô over and over like retards.

                            I always wonder why they do that too.  Makes no sense.  I just chalk it up to general incompetence.

                ‚ÄúStairway to Heaven‚Äù is an impressive composition (excluding the lyrics) but the last time I wanted to hear it was 1995.

                    For me, 1980 was the year I officially decided that ‚ÄòStairway to Heaven‚Äô had to be given a rest.One thing you have to say about the early seventies; there were several excellent songs that ran well beyond the standard length of radio pop and rock, and they were played full length on top 40 radio: Stairway, of course, Nilsson‚Äôs ‚ÄòJump into the Fire‚Äô, Clapton‚Äôs ‚ÄòLayla‚Äô, Grand Funk Railroad‚Äôs ‚ÄúGetting Closer to My Home‚Äù, Don McLean‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmerican Pie‚Äô. Before that, ‚ÄòHey Jude‚Äô, and the Stones‚Äô ‚ÄòYou Can‚Äôt Always Get What You Want‚Äô.Jimmy Page admitted that ‚ÄòStairway‚Äô was somewhat of a rip-off of a song by Spirit, the California band that gave us (I‚Äôm all but certain) the world‚Äôs oldest rock-and-roller; their drummer was 44 when the group formed in 1968; that would make him Jimmy Carter‚Äôs age.

                Contemplating human beings is best done from middle-distance, in short bursts. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs like peering into the Ark of the Covenant; it‚Äôs more like thinking too much about food ‚Äì where it comes from, what it objectively is, what happens to it after it goes down the throat.Like many readers of the Z blog, I enjoy a well-cooked porterhouse steak. But I enjoy it far less if I contemplate its back-story, from ‚Äòon the hoof‚Äô to on my plate. Even more disgusting is the after-story. So; in the ‚Äúlife of a steak‚Äù I dwell on one shining moment.People are like that; it‚Äôs why we put attractive photographs of them on our refrigerators. These are not pictures that carry us into the depths of the people we care about ‚Äì no pictures of them grunting like pigs taking a shite, for example, no pictures of them clipping their toe-nails, or expressing their asinine opinions.It was Remy de Gourmont who compared the contents of the everyday human mind to the contents of the everyday human stomach: A foul and revolting glop, half-digested fragments of misunderstood ideas, outright lies, self-serving delusions, a vomitus of pure degradation.No, as Hoffer said, if you love life, if you love your fellow man, you must moderate your expectations.

            I had a feeling that Z man would shake off the blues and deliver. Since his black-pilling we‚Äôve enjoyed the usual outburst of blogposts and anothet tip-top podcast.
Not to put pressure on you, Z man, but without your podcasts and Radio Derb, I‚Äôd have to hang myself.
A life is at stake here, sir.

        When you described Baltimore society in the 50‚Äôs, I thought of India and Sri Lanka ‚Äì where I spent time.
As a percent of population in some areas, they have even more Muslims than Western Europe.  But the Muslims generally stay out of trouble and don‚Äôt hassle the majority ethnic and religious groups.
When the Muslims do piss off the locals, the Hindus or Buddhists get together a big mob and burn the Muslim neighborhood to the ground.

            Myanmar is a good example of the third world strategy for keeping the Muslims in line. Not nice, but the folks there can read the same news we do, draw their own conclusions about what they want the future to look like and act accordingly, using such resources as they have.

                Yep.  I don‚Äôt know any of the backstory but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the Muslims tried to act on ideas about sharia law and kaffis being their slaves or whatever.  The local Buddhists stomped it down hard.

        Stop right there, Z.What‚Äôs this horse puckey about ‚Äòhit the range once a month‚Äô? That‚Äôs how our cops end up ‚Äòspraying and praying‚Äô that they hit the perp and not some bystanders. That‚Äôs why the Persian Pistol Princess didn‚Äôt successfully kill anyone when she flipped out!TWICE a week!After ya buy the gun and a holster, your next purchase should be a reloader. Spit the expenses on that with friends and get a top of the line progressive, or cheap out and get a single stage. Get them shooting too ASAP!Oh- and get a rifle too. AR15, and stock up on high cap mags. (Alright, AK‚Äôs and other sport utility rifles are optional ‚Äì but the type is mandatory ‚Äì if they won‚Äôt make an idiot like Feinstein or Hogg crap their pants in fright ‚Äì you‚Äôre looking at the wrong gun!)Do this NOW.

        I‚Äôm pretty libertarianish and think we would be better off with a lot less government.  I cringe when you mention Reason ‚Äì you are correct to honk the clown horn for them.  They are not serious people and seem incapable of working out the consequences of their ideas.
The whole place took a pretty hard turn to the left about 2 years ago and lost what little credibility they ever had.

                        Pardon me, I will type more plainly.  The only fans of small government appear to be white people.  Those of a duskier hue seem to generally prefer stuff that once belonged to others and big government is the most efficient means of confiscation and redistribution.

        (Move to Iowa) I totally agree with the moving/immigrant angle. Another factor I see affecting the more skilled is the rise in state-specific occupational licensing. You can spend hundreds a year and mountains of time just to buy/earn/acquire a state occupational license for a profession that you are already trained for and successful at. Try moving to another state where your previous license is meaningless, now you get to start over with the new state‚Äôs shakedown.I have bachelor and master degrees in engineering from prestigious universities and have had a successful 35 year career. I retired from Florida to Oregon. In Oregon if I want to work as or call myself an engineer I have to study for, pay for, and pass two state-level exams. Essentially I need to buy the state‚Äôs permission to work, despite my long and successful history in my field. Employers of course are too stupid  to judge for themselves whether they should hire me without the state‚Äôs stamp of approval.Some guy in Oregon successfully fought his red light camera ticket by analyzing the intersection dimensions and light timing, proving that state traffic laws were violated by the whole scheme. For his efforts on his own behalf he was subsequently charged with practicing engineering without a state license.

        Memorial Stadium, late 70s ‚Äì early 80s. I was and remain a small-town kid who trusted people. I was an Oriole fan back then ‚Äì and I mean a serious Oriole fan. When I lived in DC for a few years, when the imperial city had no baseball team, I drove ‚Äì several times, alone ‚Äì to Baltimore and caught night games at the old stadium. Back then they just parked everyone in a giant phalanx of cars end-to-end. If you happened to have your car in the middle of said phalanx, you just waited until people peeled off; the advantage was that you stuck around and watched the whole game, since leaving early just meant sitting on the hood of your car smoking cigarettes and drinking beer, if you thought ahead and brought some.One time, I think it was the last time I saw a game at Memorial, at any rate at night, I paid a black homeowner $5 to park in his driveway. He was a great guy; we talked Orioles baseball, I met his wife, we drank two or three beers; it was nice ‚Äì something you remember.Anyway, like I said, I was a small town kid, but I assumed that everyone were ‚Äújust people‚Äù. In hindsight I was probably setting myself up for disaster ‚Äì a twenty-year-old kid from hicktown, beered up and entirely virgin regarding crime and violence. I may not have even bothered to lock my car ‚Äì that‚Äôs what life was like for me back then.But all my experience of Memorial Stadium was delightful.I love and honor those days, and I‚Äôll always love Baltimore ‚Äì the idea, if not the hard reality Z man gives us.

        As a fan of classic American literature, I can‚Äôt let the ‚ÄúBaddass Martian Warlord‚Äù quip go without some art.Always use to be amused by that shady huckster Musk making coy statements about Mars early settlers needing to be ‚Äòbrave‚Äô.  Now he just comes out and admits the truth ‚Äì they‚Äôre all going to die.  But I tend to agree with you Zman, you and I will most likely never bash green-headed monsters or shag princesses on Barsoom, not while the insane run this asylum.A few years back I purchased what I thought would be a nice hardcover edition of Burroughs first volume in the series, only to discover Schoonover‚Äôs colored plates missing and a 50-page introduction by some foreign born, white obsessed nut named Junot Diaz, stating that I not only had permission from the social justice cult to read this novel, but that I could still find ways to enjoy it ‚Äòin spite of the racism‚Äô.That progressives could be so petty, so relentless in their quest to seek out this old book to target white American culture is just another reminder of Tolken talking through Strider, ‚Äú‚Ä¶at all times they smell the blood of living things, desiring and hating it.‚ÄùWhen faced with such an enemy, becoming a warlord doesn‚Äôt sound so farfetched after all.

        Libertarians are simply another group in love with extremism.  Like liberals have to continually push the envelop in one direction, libertarians push it in the other direction.  Extremists never reach the end.  There is always another step to be taken.

            Thomas Sowell called it ‚Äúthe vision of the anointed‚Äù. The standard-bearers of purity.The Christian churches of late antiquity suppressed the fad for theatrical and narcissistic forms of asceticism, such as living in holes dug out of the sands of Egypt, or sitting on top of poles in rags, fed ‚Äì if at all ‚Äì by passersby tossing them bits of bread or meat; we know that men and women lived naked in common quarters, to wrestle with and triumph over the sexual urge, no doubt feeding on snakes, beetles and grass.The Church put a stop to all this nonsense, because it was neither virtuous nor human: It was insanity, decked out as what we today call ‚Äúvirtue-signalling‚Äù.Sterner times, weren‚Äôt they? Instead of half-starved men living in trees or caves, our ‚Äúpure ones‚Äù are the likes of Nick Gillespie, in his leather jacket, pounding out ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù on a laptop, or Glenn Reynolds, bragging about his guitars, his jacked performance in the weight-room, his latest column about something or other in USA Today, and crying ‚ÄúFaster Please!‚Äù to some pharmaceutical breakthrough that might give men erect dicks until they are 110.Marie Antoinette played at being a milkmaid in her little ‚Äòpeasant town‚Äô built on the edge of her estate at Versailles.I‚Äôd be eager to ask Nick, Glen, or for that matter any ‚ÄúSJW‚Äù how their life behavior differs from Marie Antoinette‚Äôs.

            Tennessee will be fine. The GOP holds more than 20-point leads in all areas but Memphis and Nashville. Bredesen is in his 70s and has recently received the endorsement of Joe Biden. If he was trying to run as someone who would work with Trump, that just killed it. What Tennessee DOES need to do is rid the state of its NeverTrumpers and RINOs. Thankfully, Corker is quitting and Haslam is term-limited.

            Apple is missing out on a huge opportunity here.  If they are serious about privacy, I will go from ‚Äúmeh‚Äù about my iPhone to excited about it, and trade in the old one for a ‚Äúprivacy protected‚Äù one.  Get with it, Tim Cook.

                Tin Men ‚Äì fun picture. There is another Baltimore movie, a romantic comedy from 1984 called ‚ÄòFinnegan Begin Again‚Äô, that captures some of the decline of Baltimore into chaos, though with a light touch. My wife and I saw this in, of all places, a London pub, on our honeymoon; I‚Äôll always treasure it for that, for the fact that I love Mary Tyler Moore and Robert Preston, and that it‚Äôs clever and touching.
Check it out.

        The POC will always ensure that the LGBTQBLT community will never be anything but a circular firing squad. As you pointed out at the beginning of the podcast, blacks burn down their own neighborhood, so if you invite them into your thing, they will do what they can to burn that down, too. Awhile back I went with my girlfriend to a late show at the local movie-house, where, for some reason, almost everyone in the audience was black. The house goes dark, and a trailer for ‚ÄúThe Danish Girl‚Äù comes on. ‚ÄúThe Danish Girl‚Äù is supposed to be a poignant, touching tale about one of the first men to receive sex reassignment surgery. The black people in the crowd did not find the trailer to be moving, and they started cracking up and shouting and clowning like the black kids I remember from high-school when a substitute teacher was in the room. One black guy even stood up and said, ‚ÄúOh, hell nah, nigga! The Danish Girl! Fuck outta here with that!‚Äù

            A couple thoughts:1.  I have unfortunately spent some time in a Walmart in the part of Houston that is very heavily populated by Arabs, Pakistanis and low caste Indians.  I remember thinking wow black people have never seemed so incredibly normal.  I‚Äôm sure that if a race war breaks out we‚Äôd be on the same side, at least initially.2.  Leninism worked because the people they put in charge of the system were all peasant mud farmers before communism gave them wealth and status.  It was a mass of random ethnic and religious minorities, but they all had come from the same shitty place and would go back to the same shitty place if communism ever failed.  Bioleninism can‚Äôt work because the coalition of the fringes doesn‚Äôt like each other, and each has their own special view of the shitty place they‚Äôre in.  The oppression Olympics is just not consistent with a unified totalitarian government.

            It‚Äôs true that the weather is bad and the landscape is ‚Äì let‚Äôs say ‚Äì uniform. It‚Äôs true that in large parts of Iowa, Illinois and western Ohio, the only ‚Äúdistinguishing features‚Äù of the landscape are the water-towers of nearby towns.By the way, southern Ontario is even worse. It‚Äôs the bleakest agro-region I‚Äôve ever seen. They have no sense of style and they don‚Äôt care; they just grow stuff. Telephone poles are their sacrifice to ‚Äústyle‚Äù.Doesn‚Äôt mean it sucks. You want suckdom, consider Norilsk in northern Siberia, where the landscape is flat, frozen, and dead ‚Äì thanks to the mining of nickel that our cars may be equipped with catalytic converters ‚Äì or Bangkok, where it is always 95 in the shade and peasants sell dried fish along the pavement, where it‚Äôs 110, and they get to retire after 14-hour days to tin-roofed shacks in abandoned lots. I‚Äôve seen it; that‚Äôs their life.That sucks, it sucks hard, it sucks long.
