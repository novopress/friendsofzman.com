An acceptance letter from an Ivy League  university is almost like a Mensa membership in that it is indicative of superior intellectual ability, a trait employers want.

            Point of argument is not to toil in what if’s.  Couple of tests and don’t waste your time on Harvard.   The aptitude is there, run with it. I like it.   Create an engaging work environment though.  One does learn to show up and strive for something when attending class in college.   Fast track doesn’t necessarily foster work ethic or humility.  College still has a place. However, I agree college instructions will be modified along with recruiting requirements from forward thinking enterprises.  Forward we go.   IQ 130.
