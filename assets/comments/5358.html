        “… If elections are now rituals for the hoi polloi to blow off steam, what difference does it make that the commies are in league with anarcho-capitalists? Democracy is not just another sporting event in Greece. You buy a team jersey, got somewhere to drink outside and cheer for the guys wearing your jersey. When it’s over, you sing some songs, get drunk and fall asleep.”Minus the unscheduled appearance of Donald Trump in the current production,elections are different in the US exactly how?(Of course, even with a guest appearance by The Donald,it may make no difference.)…

            There’s little difference. Voters turned out in huge numbers to put Droopy and Weepy in charge the the legislature. They immediately set about giving Obama all that he was unable to get from his own party for six years.
The difference here is we control our own money. When the coalitions shift – and they are about to shift significantly – reform is possible, if not probable.

        I like the phrase ” pro bail-out conservatives”. I’m just going to fiddle while the world burns. I think we’re cooked, all of us.

        Whether the “money people” are good or bad misses the point. The painfully obvious point is Greece overspends,  lavishly supporting lazy, self entitled folks in the manner to which they are accustomed. Greece borrows and borrows and borrows again to pay back part of what they borrowed. So, the people that made the loans are the bad guys? Loaning money to the Greeks is a fools errand. The West should have let the Russians have Greece in the late 40’s.

        The world is currently ‘under aquisition’ by the moneyed interests (i.e. bankers and insurance funders), and as long as we continue to pay rent and do as we’re told, they’ll let us live here.
