        […] no predictions on whether this will succeed. This is a weird time for the GOP. I called it the Yankee Crackup because the ruling coalition is at war with itself in ways we have not seen in a very long time. […]

        Midlands? Are you writing about Virginia thru the Carolina’s? Mid-west fly-over county?I’ve been a follower for a couple of months, and appreciate your unique take, but this time the terminology leaves me guessing.

            Here’s a handy map done by JayMan.
The Pennsylvania colony was the start and those people moved west into the Midwest and even as far south as Texas.

        I am a little confused about the “Old Time Yankees”- aren’t they mostly the old wasps or other Northern Europeans who made up the Rockefeller wing of the party. The Dem elites in New England ( Kennedys excepted, of course) were mostly the academics. The Irish were powerful and Democrat, but in a much more normal person way.

            I think of “Yankee” as culture, more than ethnicity. Te Irish who poured into Boston did not change the culture substantially. They modified it around the edges, but they mostly assimilated. The same is true of Italians into New York, which was always a hodgepodge of people reflecting the Dutch permissiveness of the founding population. Those Italian Catholics quickly became socially liberal.So when I write about Yankee culture, it’s in the broadest sense of the term, incorporating both ideological extremes. The debate between Calvin Coolidge and Jane Addams could occur in the parlor over tea. That’s because culturally and temperamentally they are the same. A debate between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams was a rock fight in the yard because the two men may as well have been form different planets.The people in charge today are from the Northeast, encompassing the Midlands, New York and New England. Their colonies in the West are dominant in those areas. The big fight we are seeing is between the factions within this ruling coalition. The South, Appalachia and the Southwest are just observers. At least for now.

        Fine with the Syrian engineer? Not if he’s a Moslem I’m not. Some of the “brown guys loitering at Home Depot” may one day assimilate. Or maybe not, but maybe their kids will. Moslems do not assimilate and their spawn often turn out more extreme than the parents. Do not allow yourself to be fooled by the level of education attained, or the professions some of them enter. In the end we non-Moslems are just a bunch of kuffar to them, to be used, abused, and ultimately conquered. Islam allows them to lie to us and live “peacefully” among us until their population is large enough and the time is right for them to assert themselves and their belief that Islam is superior to any other political system. And then watch as those assertions become actions which endanger us all.

            You are right, Kathleen. In the end, even the most moderate muslims must by the nature of their faith, follow whatever their leaders say, no matter what the cost. If the mullahs say jump and come down with heavy boots right on top of what’s underneath, the faithful’s only question is how high do we jump?

                I really wish I weren’t, UKer. I know too much about Islam. It’s a situation where knowing the truth does not set you free but brings anxiety and dread, yet one cannot “unknow” these things. And your country and the rest of Europe are further down this road than we. But never fear, I’m sure our Dear Leader intends to play catch-up. I read today that Secretary of Surrender John Kerry says we’ll be taking in more Syrian refugees. And seeing as they can’t cross the border from their country to ours, our government is only too happy to fly them here courtesy of the American taxpayer! Talk about theatre of the absurd. Isn’t forced cultural enrichment just grand?

        Something is happening but you don’t know what it is – do you, Mr. Jones.
Trump is no more outre, in a political sense, than was Obama. Both Walter Russell Mead with his blue model analysis and Angelo Codevilla with his ruling class/country class dichotomy offer insights.
Conventional wisdom is until it isn’t.

            Having lived in New England and the South, with stops in between, the differences are the filter through which I tend to view everything. These ethno-cultural plates shift around and the parties and institutions ride in top. We tend to look at these shifts in the short window of our lives, but the cycles probably cover multiple generations. It very well may be that the old Reagan coalition, which was pretty much the FDR coalition without the blacks, is reforming despite the interregnum of the Bush years.
