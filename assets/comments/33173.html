        I have a bad feeling that Trump is exactly the wrong type of person we need in command right now. He has zero incentive to resist the pressure his jewish handlers will impose to use goyim cannon fodder for the greater Khazar-Israel  project.

            But the cannon fodder itself can turn its back on the post-country that turned its back on them. It is already happening. The response to the ethnic cleansing of the American military is to aid and abet it by not enlisting.If you are a billionaire and you are paying a bunch of guys to guard the compound, is it your compound, or is it theirs?In the meantime, the Dems are now not just scolding White men, they are scolding White women. I hope they keep it up.As Z said, years are unfolding in weeks and there are many things to come unwound.

                    A slave’s feeling of power is derivative of (his feeling of) the power of his master. His vocation is the maintenance of that feeling.
The rarest things in the world are slave revolts and “good cops” (or evenputsch-mindedcops). They’re almost perfectly contrary to human nature.
I doubt there’s a non-fictional example of either phenomenon.

            Looking back at empires afflicted with crisis issues it’s rare for someone to be up for the task.  Louis the 16th, Czar Nicolaus and even Charles the First were master tacticians compared to Trump.  It’s really nothing against him in the end as the system reform required at this point is well beyond the ability of anyone within the system to do anything about it.

        “Through no fault of his own, Trump will inherit an empire surrounded by chaos of its making but lacking the human capital to understand the problems and set them right.”Yep. It’s the classic case of “be careful what you wish for, because you might get it.” If the economy collapses on his watch or the SHTF for any other reason, the Democrats are going to pin the blame on him and make him into the next Herbert Hoover.On some level I think the Democrats understand this. The “solution” to a crisis is always  more government. After Trump’s lame-duck second term, they can demand more government power and continue their project of creating a one-party state for the next fifty years. Nothing would help that agenda more than shit getting sideways during the next four years. The worse it gets, the better it is for them.

        What we know is that Syria is now “controlled” by a collection of Muslim fanatics who have little in common with one another.And it’s pretty hilarious how the mainstream media is already carrying water for those terrorists.Syrian rebel leader’s victory speech holds a message for Iran – and for Trump and Israel too“Abu Mohammad al-Jolani’s road toDamascushas been long. He has talked openly about his change along the way. From young al Qaeda fighter two decades ago, to rebel commander espousing sectarian tolerance.”What? That $10 million bounty on his head for terrorism? Offered by the US? Come now, this is a festive occasion! Let’s not argue and bicker about who committed crimes against humanity against who!

            Terrorists are people we don’t like. Rebels are the people we do like. Therefore, by definition, the people ruining Syria are rebels and not terrorists. It’s all very simple once you know the code.
It’s just like how it is here on the home front. The difference between a protest and a riot is which side the people involved are on.  Leftists, even those with bricks breaking windows are protestors whose demands should at least be considered in a positive light. Rightists, OTOH, are rioters and should be punished.

They’re currently on the State Department’s list of terrorist organizations — but not to worry, they’ll be erased from the list pronto. The $10m bounty on the head of the leader placed by the US government will also disappear.

                A lot of things here, and in the West as a whole, operate according to these kinds of a priori “knowledge”. If you can put aside your personal revulsion for the people doing this “reasoning” it actually makes sense. Consider, as Z writes:“Our democracy” is a system that always confirms their righteousness and their right to rule. Any other result means someone or something has sabotaged “our democracy.”This is how the Romanians, for example, can “know” that there was Russian subversion in their election. The results don’t make sense from the globalist point of view, hence someone cheated. They could have gone with space aliens but Russians are somewhat more plausible.The same thing applies in hiring, academics, even housing choices. We “know” that everyone is the same regardless of sex, race, IQ, etc… So when the retarded Pygmy scores 200 on the SAT and the rich White kid gets a 1550, we “know” Whitey cheated – again. Reparations are clearly due!I think this general tendency is referred to as Gnostic. There is secret knowledge that makes sense of everything. Once you have it the world makes sense and the decisions of the rulers seem just.

            It must be increasingly hard for the xirls and xims who write for fashionable gibberish publications like Huffpo, Jezebel, and the New Yorker to keep all this stuff straight. I mean one day a group of Jihaddis is a violent, patriarchal, enemy of all wymmym, trans-persyns, and SCIENCE. Then literally the next day, they are “liberating” the wymmyn of Syria by making them wear veils and Gaia only knows what they’re doing to gays and guys in dresses.You could probably make some quick cash producing a nice cartoon info-graphic about who’s who aimed at 5th grade level reading and comprehension skills. Perhaps they already have staffers who do just that though.

        The Romanian situation is of particular interest. Our Democracy prevailed over the actual winner of the election, Calin Georgescu, because it was claimed the public was manipulated, no,mayhave been manipulated, to vote the Wrong Way via TikTok (is there anything TikTok can’t do?). As happens when the United States and other Our Democracies overturn election results, Antifa and the propaganda organs were deployed to denounce and terrorize the voters, who foolishly think voting is intended to reflect public preferences. The Romanian Supreme Court went so far as to write social media had shown unfair preference for Calin Georgescu. No, strike that, the Romanian Supreme Court opined TikTokmayhave shown an unfair preference for the winner, who is a bad person. Romanians who are over 40 years of age have fresh memories of this sort of Our Democracy although this would have been heavy-handed even for the Soviets. As happens in Our Democracies, Romanians will have to keep voting until they attain the Right Result that Our Democracies expect of them.Pulling out, this shows how fragile the Global American Empire has become. Yes, its residual wealth will keep the satellite countries in its orbit a bit longer, but expect this weird combination of imperialism and totalitarianism to increase over the months ahead. As even more Syrians flee to avoid the Israel/United States-orchestrated imposition of a rape and murder jihadist regime, European voters who increasingly do not Welcome Refugees may show the same impudence to assert opinions contrary to those who rule Our Democracies. Remember, we have to fight them over there so they will come over here–Our Greatest Ally excepted from the human deluge, of course, and your votes had better reflect that iron law of the universe. Again, strike that, your votes will reflect that iron law of the universe.Who will be Europe’s Walesa? We may know in a few months although the GAE is far more vicious and violent than even the USSR was in this regard. OK, strike even that, the GAE’s master Israel is even more vicious and violent than the USSR was in all regards.

                        Indeed. It is understandable that Walesa would have an affection for a United States that no longer exists (if it ever did), but surely he recognizes what the GAE is doing to Europe because it is so eerily similar.

                            Wałęsa’s chief concern has always been the welfare and fame of Wałęsa. Only ignorant Westerners who don’t speak Polish venerate this figure (whose personality is really just a simpleton blessed with abundance of low cunning). Havel at least was able to speak the intelectual language of the international saloons. Wałęsa tingled the same romantic sentiment for the “working man” that evolved into celebration of non-white savages once the “working class” fell out of fashion. Today he’s just a relic of a bygone era, with the elderly chattering class paying their ritual tributes every time the anniversary of “Our Democracy” passes by to the interest of nobody.

                                Maybe a bit harsh, but to your point Walesa certainly was situated to destroy the records that revealed his informant status and since he did not they emerged. Still, peasant cunning has a quality of its own.

                    People who clearly remember Havel have made the Trump comparison, celebrity turned reformist liberal, etc. Trump’s trajectory toward an ever more globohomo-friendly Trumpism—fully ceding his mandate to Thielet al.—mirrors Havel, whose initial rise saw him similarly falsely accused of being a fascoid nationalist/revanchist, when he was always just a normie shitlib.A Trump or a Haveltake the placeof a people’s revolt. They thwart a potentially real* one with a symbolic one. Neither of them meant to do that.Farage is what you get when the part is played by abadactor instead of an ineffectual one.Faking it is still worthwhile, as the terrorized reaction—from total regime backlash to the self-sterilizing madwomen of TikTok—shows. But in the end, the end.*What’s possible is what actually happens. In theory, the people might really win one. We never have and we never do, but that idea exists and persists, continually raising suspicion, motivating our rulers against us, etc.

Donald doesn’t have the kind of folks around him it’d take to put the nation on solid footing.  He’s a billionaire, Eighties liberal, too easily swayed by females — the bane of modern man.  The Right, desperate, embraces Drumpf as savior but it’s a’wishin’.  He’s of the Elite.  He did not grow up like we did, and he doesn’t know the things we had to learn.America needs a shitkicker to eject (with extreme prejudice) the criminal and occult classes deep-rooted in the nation.  For all the Left’s standard fainting and hysteria, I don’t think Donald effectively threatens the basic agendas of the lefties or globalistas.

            Understanding the ruling class in terms of occultism is a good starting point. In my other post today, which is hopefully out of approval jail now, I referred to this problem as Gnosticism. A lot of things that don’t make sense to us are quite reasonable to the elites with their “hidden knowledge”. Sometimes people look at their behavior and conclude that they must have actual secret knowledge. Hence you get conspiracy theories. I’m sure some of those theories are (mostly) correct but I suspect that most of the time you’re just dealing with an elite that operates according to occult ideas that they think give them some unique insight into events. Anyone remember “the end of history”? Yeah, that was a popular notion among the same out-of-touch cloud people back in the 90s and early 2000s. These people have now jumped on a bunch of other equally crazy mystical bandwagons and are unfortunately still in power.Unfortunately I think you’re right that Trump’s roots are still in the elite. I do have some hope though, that as a businessman, he allows facts and reality to inform him especially when the occult crystal ball gazers are proven wrong over and over again.

                ‘In my other post today, which is hopefully out of approval jail now, I referred to this problem as Gnosticism.’That’s a good general term for the ‘religion’ of the Western elite.  Largely they are Gnostic, and representative of the ancient pagan cults of differing types — mostly solar-based systems.  ‘Nothing new under the sun’.  The elite families most certainly do belong to various secret and semi-secret (in the case of Britain) organizations and societies.  Their existence and power are not conspiracy theories.It’s not possible to evaluate national or global conditions without taking into account these groups and organizations.  Gnosticism, neo-paganism, luciferianism, and various sects stemming from the Talmud created during the Babylonian Captivity call the shots on this planet.  They seek globalism and re-creation of the Original Human Condition and re-surfacing of the Original Light Within . . . very much a Gnostic obsession btw.

        The only thing that actually surprised some people is Turkish perfidy, which is the last thing that should surprise anyone. As usual, “Cui Bono” cuts through the fog. Whatever the long term effects of turning Syria into Libya, Israel has quite effectively removed Iranian pressure from its immediate borders. You have to hand it to them, The serial campaigns of the past year have been a hybrid war example of defeat in detail that will be studied for generations.Russia appears to have decided that when it comes to ports, Odessa is more important than Tartus, especially when the SAA is bribed to stand down. The only question now is whether they will likewise abandon Iran to its fate. Are two fronts against the GAE better than one?How about three? Much will depend on the strategic calculus of the inscrutable Chinamen.The lesson here is hang together or hang separately. Oh, and never trust a Turk.

        The usual suspects are losing their credibility all over the Western world. A lot of them don’t even like each another. And as we see with people like Joe and Mika, they will publicly kneel before whoever has power even though it contradicts what they just said yesterday.  It sure seems like the old centers of power can’t hold much longer.

        Speaking of France, did anyone else catch the disgusting spectacle at Notre Dame?
Why is this performance not a French woman singing in French?

            I had not seen that – and yes, it is disgusting.  Imagine what the original builders of that monument to European Christendom would think.

                Yeah, the authorities had to say right after the fire that Muslims hadn’t started it on purpose, because such is the case with French parish churches on an almost weekly basis. We’re supposed to feel relieved it was an accident (not that we’ll ever really know). Same sort of mind-fuck they do when their pets go off and stab schoolchildren for no particular reason. Try to pass it off as mental illness.

        This means France is currently without a governmentHeh.The staggering thing about these daft situations is that: nobody outside of government really seems to care or notice. Didn’t you boys have some sort of shutdown during Trump first reign, which leftists over here thought was “just terrible”… if I recall, most on this blog didn’t give two hoots because at this point: less government intervention and function seems to be preferential!Seems that, when these ‘shutdowns’ or ‘collapses’ happen, the main, necessary arms of government still function, and the private sector does what it does. It’s just the millions of state-funded lackeys that are (rightly, in their case) pissed off!Thanks for the article. Had no idea the Koreans were in that state, and the Romanian issue is the classic “our democracy” not turning out quite how the elites hoped. I must say, “our democracy” is becoming my favourite phrase at the moment, surpassing even “it’s all so tiresome”.

                France doesn’t really need a government as long as it has the President. Even though he can’t formally govern the internal affairs he has plenty of tools to flip off an unfriendly Parliament.Trump could wish he had the same, instead of “checks and balances” that eventually led to the castration of the office, with the emergence of permanent bureaucracy and preference for managerial governance.Absolutist traditions win vs the republican ones when strong authority is needed.

            One small point on U.S. government “shut-downs”.  The only thing they ever shut down is the only stuff normal people get from the government:  National Parks and the Smithsonian.  Two things that probably could be run by volunteers.

        Like we say over at Sev’s joint, we’re under the Do Long Bridge.I figure it this way. The Regime has decided, in its profoundly stupid and inchoate fashion where no one is in charge, just factions, that it is either Bagel Land or Ukraine, to salvage something and hand the Bad Orange Man an unwinnable war. We all know who wins that contest for AINO’s heart and wallet. The great question is, now that those pluckyrebels  jihadistsFreedom Fighters have won, can they hold on to power? Once the Russians wrap up the important (to them) war with victory, what does that mean for Syria in another year?

        Trumps instincts are correct:  Let the rest of the world deal with the chaos.  Syria, Ukraine, Romania, S. Korea, France?  There is no need to meddle in any of these messes [especially since U.S. meddling only makes things WORSE].
Trump needs to stay focused on what is happening within the United States and its borders.  There is enough work to be done cleaning up the Biden immigration disaster to keep the entire executive branch busy for the next four years.

            I’m not looking to be confrontational.
“Let the rest of the world deal with the chaos.”  Israel?
I read that our military was directly involved in the toppling of Syria.  How does that help us?
The “America First” sentiment is so inspiring, but almost everyone has a blind spot concerning our greatest ally.  What prevents us from consistently applying America First?  We’re just being fooled once again.

                You could also look at Israel as another pawn in the anti-Russia “Great Game” so beloved by Anglo-Saxon elites: the British Empire in the 1800s, and the American Empire vs. the USSR in the late 20th century. Fall of Assad breaks the “Shia Crescent” and severely reduces Russian power and influence in the region. I find it hard to believe the “rebel alliance” toppled Assad in a matter of days without significant help (intel/arms/funding/”advisors”) from NATO (i.e. Turkey, UK), the Gulf Arabs, and Israel.…and look who’s back in town! It’s those beloved “White Helmets”, the UK-handled ISIS front group:Syria’s White Helmets release video showing rescue operations in war-torn Idlib

        “They lack the resources and manpower to remain in control for long, so that means the many other factions and their sponsors will be looking to either flow into the void left by Assad or carve out more space for themselves in what used to be Syria.”Syria has been a failed state, a zombie, a dead man walking, for a long time. This is not primarily because of the Assad regime, but because of insoluble festering resource problems. Those problems will remain to afflict whoever is in charge, or nominally in charge. External powers — Russia, Iran — propped up Assad for quite some time.Realpolitikwas the motive. But they can’t have been oblivious to the domestic problems.Postscript: What you’re saying about France, and Europe generally, is of course absolutely correct. These European “leaders” hitched their wagon to Biden’s star. Now that Team Biden is out on its ass, so too shortly will the European “leaders” be. With or without these clowns, the European economy — the beating heart of which has hitherto been Germany — is now in terminal decline. And that’s just the way of the world. As you point out, the thing propping up the European economy was cheap energy from Russia. Even with that cheap energy the European economy was in slow decline. It has been rapid decline for the last two and a half years.There’s a recent interview with Dmitry Orlov on the “Dialogue Works” channel on YouTube. I recommend listening to it.

            Amazingly, the United States deliberately cut off the Assad regime from its primary energy source and its primary food source in the hope the starving Syrians would rise up against Assad. When that failed, they created ISIS and other “rebel” groups. The result was a slow draining of Syria, but Washington was somehow caught off guard by this collapse. Once again, they did not think past the first set of moves. “Remove Assad, something magical happens and we get a pro-Western regime in Syria!”

                The stupidity of the Syria policy is unreal. My kid was in a unit that partially deployed there and came VERY close to going. The U.S. base there was 100% illegal under international law and the Constitution. There was never any Congressional declaration of war on Syria. Syria never attacked the U.S. but the U.S. had a base on Syrian soil to help the “rebels” overthrow Assad.The “rebels” we were backing were Kurds, who want Turkish territory. The Turks are our NATO ally and we are obligated to defend their territory under Article 5. The Turks sent troops into Syria to engage the very Kurds we were backing.To call this a “clusterfuck” is the understatement of the decade. The people in charge of this policy are actual morons and idiots who know nothing but are arrogantly high on their own supply and think they know how to run the world.Incredible.

                Research shows sanctions never work. But TPTB are too stupid, or conniving and won’t alleviate the suffering of common people. The people who live on less than a dollar a day. All the money that went to the MICIMATT via Ukraine could’ve provided clean drinking water for millions. About three million women and children die from respiratory disease every year, from indoor cooking on wood fueled fires. What an easy problem to solve, but no, the West mandates they must use wind and solar power; they aren’t allowed to develop modern power plants. The hypocrisy that causes inhumane suffering makes my blood boil. Access to clean drinking water and energy for safe indoor cooking are two problems that could be solved right now, if it weren’t for the sociopathic, globalist money laundering. Why do we never hear Bill Gates or Elon Musk discussing the real problems of those who are truly the poorest, and realistic solutions? Never forget Major General Smedley Butler: All wars are bankers’ wars!

        The United States has been the “cleanest dirty shirt in the pile” for generations. As dirty as the USA has been, the rest of the world just gets dirtier. I would, possibly, exempt Russia and Eastern Europe from this assessment. Their economies are OK, not great, but OK. Also, they seem to have built up a greater sense of community around a resurgence of Eastern Orthodoxy. China’s economy, predictably, is big giant disaster in the waiting. We would do well to disengage from China (why do I hear “China” in Trump’s voice) as much as possible to prevent economic contagion.

                                Does Hun stand for Han?  Feeling anger that one’s country was betrayed and its knowledge and manufacturing base and self sufficiency was sold off so that the alien elite – working with ‘old money’ like the Bushes – could profit is rather a horse of a different color.  Treason – as historically understood – causes an emotional reaction in no way akin to mere ‘hurt feelings.’  Taking pride in the West’s preeminence does not negate China’s ancient achievements . . . but China’s not my country and the Han are not my people.

            I’m not sure that the apparent resurgence of orthodoxy in the post-Soviet world is real or good.Putin means to replace the content of the Russian religion with antifascism, as his big cathedral shows. Has it worked? Judging by the Russians I know—only a few and more leftist than average—it may have. Now that there are no nazis, they’re more anti-nazi than ever. The nazis of their fantasy, like Putin’s,like the church’s, are certain Ukrainians, the broader European “far right,” MAGA Americans (as seen on TV)—and especiallyus, any resister of anti-whiteness, anyone who can say “white” without hatred. As Putin cannot.Some of them are religious. None of them used to be. They worship Jews, as any Christian does. They’re highly righteous in their leftism, as any Christian is—maybe more righteous because their church is older, so it’s righteous-er.What did we win?(I don’t know that this is the trajectory of the other non-Russian Eastern orthodoxies. The present illegality of the Ukrainian church suggests that it, at least, was different. Will it come back as it was? To whom?)

            That’s part of it. But a big factor is Ukraine. Syria was a Russian client state – which is why Assad is now in Russia. By putting so much effort into Ukraine, they had to choose, and Syria came up short.It’s a good reminder that while Russia was “grinding away” in Ukraine, there was always going to be a price to pay somewhere else. I imagine the Russian Navy is probably suffering quite a bit as the Russian army draws the best troops and funds. (I have nothing to back that up, but it stands to reason.)I would not be surprised for Trump to make a play in Cuba to open that market up to US goods, development, and tourism…take advantage of the fact that Russia has probably not had the $$$ to keep Cuba afloat.That could be the real reason why Trump put Rubia at State.  The Cubans in America have done well here, and likely the entire island would do well if opened up to greater levels of economic development.  They have a strong national identity to leverage.

        Re: the South Korean political chaos, it seems that in the background of all this was a desperate measure on the part of the South Korean central bank to stave off a systemic bank collapse. They apparently succeeded in doing some things out of the media spotlight to bring about stability in the banking sector…for now. The entire “martial law” gambit may have been a ruse to cover for the banksters.

            South Korea is a basketcase disguised as a flourishing democracy and citadel of capitalism. When I lived in that part of the world, what struck me was how much the SK population wanted to reunify with the North and abjectly hated the United States and, of course, Japan, for reasons both quite real and others totally fantasized. Counter-Currents today has an excellent overview of the insanity that grips South Korean:Walk Away from South KoreaThe presence of American troops there is to prevent reunification, which would happen immediately and rather non-violently if they were absent. To add to the CC account, American troops are assaulted and denounced routinely. To their credit, Koreans think of race first, politics a distant second, but that race is quite disturbed.The banks are corrupt but so is the society as a whole. I was at the Seoul Olympics in ’88. Feces-smeared toilet paper had to be put into trash cans in the heat. The reason offered was that the country had not developed enough to support the extra pressure on the sewage system. The actual reason was the money allocated to expand the system had been embezzled. That is an absolutely perfect metaphor for the country as a whole.

                Interesting take.  I used to work for a South Korean company – had myreports (re-written in Korean and submitted under my boss’ name) read and praised at corporate meetings.  I’ve long agreed we should withdraw all troops from there and that we should not accept any South Korean immigrants, but much of the info in the linked article is new to me.

                I know little about Korea, but the desire of the South to reunite with the North seems to support that idea that race commands deeper loyalty that values like freedom or capitalism.
If we get a chance to rebuild, we want to build on truths about human nature that are the most fundamental and trustworthy.
I submit that one of the most fundamental and trustworthy truths upon which to build is that for most non-whites most of the time, race commands deeper loyalty than any values, like religion or freedom.

                I’ve mentioned this story here before but while teaching English in Seoul in 1996, I had a university student tell me (and the class) that he couldn’t wait to reunite with North Korea.  When asked why, he pounded the desk and said, “so we will have the largest military in Asia and can make…Japan…apologize!!”
I wonder how strong and general those sentiments remain almost 30 years later?

                    I don’t know for certain but it is a good guess those sentiments remain. After I was back stateside a propaganda event along these lines really struck me. One of the three major networks of the time had footage of South Korean students protesting American troops and one struck an embassy Marine’s face and drew blood. That was shown once and never again. It hit me that the Korean hostility to the American presence was unknown here (it was to me before being there) and had to be kept secret. If a free and fair election were held to decide reunification the result in favor would be overwhelming.My time in the ROK (and elsewhere in the region) made clear, at least back then, that Japan was absolutely despised and it was as if the war had never ended. I’m firmly against American imperialism and want troops removed from abroad, but also fully recognize when that happens many old rivalries and hatreds that have been tamped down will re-emerge immediately. One of those will be Korean hostilities with Japan, and that is just the south, and apologies would be the least of it.

                China says hello.
A split Korea benefits the panda, too.  Trump’s overtures to the Norks in 2019 was a way to start chipping away at China’s ability to use North Korea to stir up regional trouble.  I think Trump will go back to this once inaugurated.  A re-unified Korea would greatly shift the balance of power in Asia away from China in the long run.  Idk, Trump seems determined to upset the post-war apple cart in places like eastern Europe, the Middle East, and the far East where a lot of these old rivalries are no longer relevant.

        I spent most of today around Korean men wearing hard hats and talking like they had marbles in their mouths. These guys are running the show, turning the C grade office buildings they bought in the 80’s that no one goes to anymore into apartment buildings with 1900 dollar studios boasting valet garbage pickup at your apartments door. The hallways spell like garbage and the carpet is stained.they exclusively hire people in the country illegally and both parties hate each other. The Koreans speak much better Spanish than English. I’m a specialist who can’t be hired at Home Depot so I ignore them. I come and go as I please and insist that they can’t watch me work. They are here to squeeze every last penny out of the hands of the country . I see them on line at the welfare office and free food giveaways at the Catholic Churches wearing golf duds and you guessed it, wearing masks. Basically a real live clown show every time I’m in that part of town that seems to be getting bigger by the year.democracy is perfect for them. It allows them to have 12 separate so called churches in one building that are tax exempt. Hey if you don’t love Jesus, go to hell…

        Violent regime change has been a common thing in 3rd world shitholes since a lot longer than I’ve been alive, so I dunno why I am supposed to care this time. I guess it makes for some diverting reading on the morning doom scroll.But blaming Russians every time an election doesn’t go the way the regime wants, having become the standard MO of the western oligarchy in the last decade, is now even more  conspicuous by its absence here in AINO in 2024. That it just happened again in Romania, but not here, kind of confirms that Trump was installed by the “elite,” or else we’d have seen the latest AINO iteration of Russia! Russia! (or else the other shoe is getting ready to drop any minute). Perhaps this latest in Romania is a test run to see how brazenly they can use Russia! to overturn elections, in preparation for further European elections next year.

        Good summary of the present situation by the Z-man.  I would add only that the situation in Georgia (the country, not the state) remains uncertain.  The political partyGeorgia Dream, which does not want Georgia to join the European Union, won the election, but the president, who is essentially French and pro-EU, has said that she won’t leave office and there have been demonstrations/ riots (with the backing of various NGOs) seeking to compel the government to reverse its policy and seek EU admission.  There may yet be another Maidan coup, although governments are getting better at thwarting them.

            All the color revolution crap in Georgia should wind down once Trump is inaugurated.  That’s all CIA/State Victoria Nuland/Samantha Power meddling.  That crap is going on in Hungary and Romania, too.  I think we’ll see Trump empowering the people who won.  Russia still controls enough of Georgia to keep them out of NATO…which was the goal of their invasion all those years ago.

        First, you must survive the interregnum of chaos, which is no easy task if you live in a big city. Second, you must disappear in plain sight and become the nobody that nobody notices. Third, you must become opportunistic and everything solely within the confines of your cranium. Fourth, think outside the box and use your God-given intelligence to do the unexpected. Simple, secret, solo, and spontaneous. We have numbers, and they cannot lock up everyone and still function as a nation. Let’s roll.

        October 7, 2023, is what changed everything in the Middle East. Hamas and all of its supporters were put on notice, and a number of unprecedented events have taken place: direct killings of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, direct missile exchanges between Israel and Iran, massive destruction of Gaza and Lebanon, the exploding pagers – and I have no doubt that this sudden deposing of Assad is part of the pattern. Hezbollah were key to sustaining his rule, and they have been absolutely decimated by Israel. Iran needs to sue for peace and get all the hostages handed back to Israel now, before Trump takes office and gives Jerusalem even more of a free hand.

        According to the Venezuelan intelligence officer who was masquerading as my Lyft driver, the countries most likely to feelEl Martilloin 2025 and beyond are Mexico, Cuba and his homeland.
This, he assured me, has nothing to do with any sort of foreign policy strategy and everything to do with the permanent re-alignment of politics inside the US.

        What got me was the astonishing turnaround. Eretz Ysrael looks like a real possibility.The reason for the October 7 operation was to give Israel and her proxies leave to attack.Now that the Iranian and Russian supply lines to Hamas / Hiz’b’allah have been sundered, their senior leadership decimated, it seems Israel has turned the tide.As Matt Bracken notes, Iran will not reach the Med now; Pipelinestan and the New Silk Road are going to go through the JudeoSunni axis, and Israel has backdoor access to the BRICS thru the Sunnis. Denied access to lucrative Russian resources, NATO is likely looking south, with Turkiye paving the way to fund further adventures.The Shia Crescent has been seriously stymied. Iraq is afraid to go in, the Kurdish tarbaby will keep double-dealing Sultan Erdogan tied up. Our HTS proxies are being brought to heel by our B-52s.I’m wondering if Trump’s visit to the Notre Dame was to coordinate with the other NATO heads of state. His MIGA Cabinet may have been the right bet, since Pam “Treyvon” Bondi is set to enforce an anti-antisemitism campaign.The Soros-funded Palestinian protests were part of the Oct 7 pretext as well, in order to give actors like (jewish) Kier Starmer, Palantir Thiel, and Pam Bondi cause to suppress the wrong kind of nationalism.All of this is part and parcel of the JudeoAnglican strategy employed since at least Mackinder, 1904.Cause chaos in any region, foreign or domestic, so that competitors cannot coalesce into a power or coordinate as a bloc.In short, surprisingly, the dream of unipolar One World Order might still be very much alive and kicking.

            Other than the anti-antisemitism stuff and Bondi, I tend to agree.  I’m not sure she has any job except running interference for the deputies under her (former Trump lawyers in the NY State cases) as they pursue investigations behind the election interference by NY government officials.All of this stuff collapsing suddenly is because of the election here.  Trump tied the hands of the regime with his antiwar positions.  Now that he has won, everything is unraveling.  Russia went all-in on Ukraine, but it probably was not necessary now that Trump has won.  But by doing so, they had to choose Ukraine over Syria leading to Syria’s collapse.  Again, advantage Trump because it boots Iran out for the time being which in turn helps Israel and wrapping up that war is important, too.  Trump will get credit for this, too (from his voters, not the media).  We lose nothing as a country by letting the Uke’s become a Russian puppet state and letting the Russians deal with that mess.Everything in the US is going to be focused internally on domestic issues.  The chaos around the world will be all the proof Trump needs that the Biden regime was a disaster, and that making America strong economically is the cure.

        With Syria, it appears that the CIA and/or Turkey bribed a lot of commanders (Israel may have also done this) to stand aside. That is the danger of the corrupt regimes, but that trick is limited. It is unlikely to work in Russia, or Iran.Now Erdogan (the big winner) has a direct land route to Israel. He may desire to attack Israel in the view that its weak, that the US will at least step aside if not actively aid him because Ukraine, etc. With his economy still free-falling, he has incentive for War.Germany and Austria are now saying they will not accept any more Syrians and will send those who fled back. At any rate there will be millions of Syrians in Europe. Both Macron and Starmer have made noises about maybe not letting so many more millions in, as likely they got security briefings on how easily Russia can start at least domestic Islamic “resistance” and possibly overthrow of their governments.They had to choose between War with Russia and Great Replacement, and they chose both.On a larger sense this shows the fragility of the Jesus Jones “Right Here Right Now” song, that has been on endless loop for Western Elites. The old arrangements could not hold and the least little thing (Trump, Ukraine) causes cascading failures. Like the Titanic holed by that iceberg.

                I think he’s going for the truism that the Roman/Byzantine and Ottoman empires in Anatolia kept the lid on Levantine anarchy and Persian influence. Syria has always been the chew toy between the two regional powers, but that balance has been broken since 1918 and the rise of the American and Soviet/Russian geostrategic proxy wars and the creation of Bagel Land which created a permanent open wound that never heals.

            The theme the media settled on for this season’s pro-censorship propaganda push was “bro.” Kamala (brat! the opposite of bro!) was rejected—and so Democracy died and fascism reigns—by the tech bros, the Rogan bros, the Bernie bros, the old-fashioned “brother” bros (said Obama), etc.Suddenly there’sthisbro, comically stereotypical. They say he wrote reviews oftwoElon biographies. He’s exactly what the feds characterize as the problem: Uncensored Internet White Man. Led astray! To stochastic terror! He’s soooooo perfect…But the conservatives, with their overwhelming desire (sexual) to defendanycorporate executive, no matter how clearly he marks himself an enemy, and the Democrat women, with their consuming lust for pretty-boy killers, have messed up the story,confuzzledit in its crib.That’s funny.We’ll see if they can swerve this shitbox back onto the road. Can the mediare-sellhim as Bro™? They are trying. It’s not likely to work. But censorship in his name will go on anyway, because…Well, consider how he was caught—not how they say he was, but how hewas. Who does that? Whosebusinessis that?

        Imagine a guy like Luigi showing up at the J6 protests, and imagine he’s not a lone wolf but there are 20-30 just like him…I’ve said for a long time that the over-the-top response to J6 was straight up fear born from the knowledge that THEY GOT LUCKY. Lucky that 99.9% of the protesters went home before dark, and none were really violent.We live in a very open and vulnerable society. Countless county health department employees are very, very, lucky that people played along with the COVID charade. It’s not hard to find where those people live and work for a business owner whose livelihood was destroy by paid “mission essential” bureaucrats. Ditto various “Lawfare” operatives. We saw in Butler, PA how easy it is to get in close whether you think the USSS and local cops were intentionally incompetent or unwittingly so.If the elites in this country have second cousins, there you will find Luigi Mangione. He’s very nearly one of them, yet he wants them dead. That has to be terrifying once you realize how many people are not your cousins but want you dead. That’s a lot of bullets, and your house has maybe 5” of siding and drywall. And zero when out at the grocery store or walking out of the gym.Vox fired that Lorenz chick who got fired from WaPost. They fired her for saying the quiet part out loud. She’s a dirtbag, but she probably is saying out loud what easily 1,000,000 people thought last week:”Gee. What a shame. Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy…🙄.”He didn’t deserve death. Few do. But they keep fu$king with peoples lives and livelihoods, and we’re going to see a lot more of this.What do they do if a left wing New York jury acquits him?

        This stuff happening now is a blessing for Trump.  It all falls on the current regime’s head.  Trump wants deportations to be the center of his first few months.  It will require the most political capital, which he will spend on kicking people out.  He will have to fight a GOP Senate that will try to stuff “comprehensive immigration reform” – amnesty – into legislation.  Figure $100B for that, paid for by……….Ukraine.Trump met with Zekensky in France.  I think it’s a safe bet that meeting was about transition planning Bashir Assad style.  Trump’s Ukraine emissary will likely have instructions to end the war quickly.  Russia will get whatever Russia wants for the most part.I suspect Syria collapsed because Putin went all-in on Ukraine.  He made a difficulty choice and is repaying his ally with a comfortable exile.Syria will mostly become a problem because the “rebels” love killing Christians more than they love killing Jews.  Trump will have to be careful, which is what his “stay out of it” message was about.  No troops.  (The 1,000 or so there notwithstanding.)  Syria was an Iranian/Hezbollah proxy state.  Iran pulled out, which probably helps in the long run.  The “rebels” will spend a lot of time fighting each other.  I agree that preventing any of them from moving to Europe or the USA should be Priority #1.But that just reinforces Trump’s first priory: immigration control.Most likely, Trump gets credit for winding down two wars.  A strengthening US economy based on cheap energy and tariffs weakens China.  Also good.And, most of Trump’s opposition has been neutered for the time being thanks to his decisive win, the defeat of Lawfare, and the SCOTUS unitary executive ruling.  Nationalist movements in Europe are about to get a boost from a friendly Trump putting an end to CUA/State Dept meddling over there.  And think we’ll see nationalism hitting Europe in positive ways as The West – the real one, not the posers in Brussels – rises up to stand for Western nations, people, and culture.Yes, much is happening.  But much of what is happening benefits the US.
