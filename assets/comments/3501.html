        Europe is trying hard to dissolve borders, and frankly it just isn’t going too work. In terms of size Europe is small and the tribal origins still dominate; it isn’t just that the Brits traditionally don’t trust the French or Germany is forever itching to occupy Belgium, but more to do with the fact we don’t change our fundamental selves.Europe then is small and remains intense because the boundaries aren’t very far from the centre of each area. Telling Europeans ‘we have a common heritage’ is palpable nonsense, and while physical wars are — for now — not on the agenda, the intellectual and economic wars roll on. Frankfurt wants to grab London’s place in world finances, and France still thinks their agriculture should rule. The only thing apparently agreed upon in the corridors of unelected power is the carefully facilitated invasion of the head-loppers and face-hiders. No, we Europeans don’t understand it either as it makes no sense economically or culturally although it has in all fairness created a whole sub-genre of lawyers willing to take public money to attempt to defend the allah-nutters.Whether Greece goes or stays is only of interest to say the Scandinavians for instance because they reasonably want to know how much it will cost to keep them ‘on board.’ At some point the elite notices it costs too much and despite their best efforts to control the media, the info filters down to the ordinary man in the street who is paying for all this excess and Joe or Pierre or Hans duly start to notice.Once the noticing begins to be noticed, the politicians have a bit of a scramble to justify their profligacy with the punters’  money but gradually it becomes clear the noticing simply doesn’t go away.Cue revolution, and while Europe is pretty familiar with various revolutions, the next one will be so big that tribal areas will start to rebuild borders on a big scale.

        Something that I’ve always found odd studying History is that we learn ‘Civillization’ begin in the Near East: Egypt, Mesopotamia (Iraq), Persia (Iran) and later Greece and Rome were the centers of Civillization but today the Mediterranean World is extremely dysfunctional and the “Northen Barbarians” are the people who maintain the Global economy.
