        The whole Iran vs. Israel thing is for show.  The OBiden regime is friends with Iran, and has been since Obama was in office.  They take every opportunity they can get to ship Iran billions of dollars, and we left behind billions in weapons in Afghanistan to help both them and the Russians and Chinese compete.So, Israel bombs an embassy outside their country, but not the actual embassy, just an “annex” allegedly housing Iranian military leaders.  Iran launched a live televised “response” with half a day’s notice and all the cameras were set up and ready to go to watch it live as the missiles and bombs arrived on schedule.  Nothing significant resulted.The incompetence lies in the assumption that everyone believes this horseshit.  It was laughably transparent that the US, Israel, and Iran orchestrated all of it.  The US needed “just enough” of the specter of theater war to push through the consolidated Israel/Ukraine/Taiwan money laundering bills.  But not so much that it might make people mad.  Iran then issued a presser essentially saying, “OK, we’re good.”  Israel will “respond”, but that response will also be muted if they do anything at all.This is a made-for-TV, made for Reddit, war.This is what they did with COVID, and in a similar way.  COVID was just bad enough to look scary, made for TV “pandemic”, but not so virulent that it might spin out of control and kill “important” people.  This allowed the Government Party to switch to mail-in ballots which are the most fraudulent and easily hacked form of voting in human history.  All rational, nonpartisan, people know this.  It was all a sham intended to install a new regime.  They even rigged their primaries to make sure a dementia patient would be installed, thereby posing no actual threat to the Intel Community’s control of the country.The incompetence to come will be in the form of how depleted and hollow our military has become.  They’re organized to fight small low-intensity regional conflicts on the ground and to make a big show of force off the coast (carriers, long-range bombers).  These are being quickly neutralized by small, inexpensive, but very lethal weapons.  Our space-based dominance is also in serious danger.  We enjoy unfettered access over enemy territory with our spy satellites.  Like the hot air balloons of the civil war and early WWI, spy satellites are sitting ducks bobbing around up there.  It’s just a matter of time before our adversaries decide to neutralize our advantage (and take out multiple orbital belts in the process).  Then we find out really fast how good we are without detailed overhead imagery, navigation, and targeting aids.  The US military simply won’t go into an AOR if they are blind.  If they do, the casualty rates will be high and the public won’t go for that.The beauty of incompetence is that it simply cannot be sustained.  The public is starting to notice this.  And while elections are a joke and fake – and the effort to disqualify Trump is picking up steam – the public clearly sees all this for what it is.  That doesn’t mean everyone does, but Trump’s polling at nearly double-digit leads in the fraud/swing states.  If the regime puts him in jail, they will not be able to stop him from being elected.Which is why the Stupid Party is working with Democrats to try and get rid of Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House.  If the GOP can put Democrats in charge of the House, Congress can then direct states to remove Trump from the ballot.  The Supreme Court of the United States said this is how it must be done…so that is what is going to be attempted next.Incompetent people always turn to evil as their final solution.

            There was a time when I would have said adjust tinfoil hat and that you were an Alex Jones level of conspiracy theorist.Post Covid? I cannot say that to you. I’m so utterly untrusting of all governments now that I could fully see some ridiculous 3 way call between Biden, Bibi, and Khomeini.“Ok we are all agreed on the plan? Sounds good… talk to you later guys!”At the end of the day, whether it was orchestrated in the manner you outlined or its simply terribly incompetent leadership fumblefucking their way through a needless conflict, it really makes no difference does it? Except that perhaps the latter could result in something radioactive if someone -really- messes up. It is utterly pathetic in either case though.

                The current state of affairs is that the regime claims that the difference between men and women is imaginary. IOW they are saying to our faces that they are either raving mad or they hold us in such contempt that they enjoy telling us idiotic things and expect us to take them seriously. Whichever it is that suggests we should not place any limits on what they might be up to.

                I’ve long advocated people take the absolutely most-cynical assessment of anything the US government does.  Combine this with the going in assumption that they are lying ALL THE TIME.  They are never not lying.  It’s their default setting.
Do those two things, and you’ll basically never be surprised.
It’s probably only a matter of time until the US government gets outed as the source of the terror attack in Moscow.
COVUD red-pilled a lot of people.  The fake vaccines red pilled more.  The Government Party’s only hope is to remove Trump from the ballot.

            “The beauty of incompetence is that it simply cannot be sustained.”
The incompetence that flowered in 1914 wasn’t sustained, but it caused a lot of damage while it lasted.
We might be headed for something similar.

                Based on the lunacy and many tragedies that took place during and after Covid, I think you’re right.
Things will get worse, much worse, before they get better.
The “accelerationists” may be about to find out whether that was such a hot idea.

        Why are our managerial elites acting against their own interests? Maybe what we’re seeing is not so much imbecility as it is alien influence. Something more akin to neuroparasitology, or “zombie” parasitism. I mean, look at the US and UK governments’ response to the October 7th Hamas raid into Israel versus the ongoing invasion across their own borders of millions of military-age men. They “stand with Israel” in the ethnic cleansing of Gazans; while offering the latter luxury accommodation to the detriment of their own native populations. And the natives can go to prison for pointing it out. Heck, US DHS- and Israeli-funded NGOs are even providing logistical support for the invaders. It’s as if foreign governments were giving paragliders to Gazans and advocating the elimination of Jewishness.It might be more productive to look at the motivations of those who influence our elites. Holocaust “deniers” may seek to remove the group’s victimhood status, but it is important to note that its tribesmen accept it as an article of faith every bit as much as the Christians who journeyed into darkest Africa believed they were saving souls from eternal damnation. So it would be desirable from their perspective to reduce Europeans to minority status as a matter of self-preservation. Meanwhile, their considerable influence can be utilized to obtain military support for an ethnostate in the Near East. An alien people would see no contradiction in that. And should Europeans grow too enfeebled to render such assistance, expect them to turn just as easily to China or Russia for support.

                Russia-Ukraine is an easy one. There are grudges against Slavs for the pogroms purportedly suffered by their ancestors. While they would prefer a return to the 90s with Russia again subject to rule by “oligarchs,” the death of many descendants of their former neighbors in the Pale of Settlement (incorporated in modern-day Ukraine) is perhaps equally sweet. China-Taiwan is more complicated. Its rise is partly attributable to the offshoring of American industry. If China’s party leaders subsequently fail to kowtow to American dictats, then our alien influencers would be perfectly happy to wreck the GAE economies to an even greater degree than Russia sanctions have (since that’s where most of our consumer industries are now located).

                        The Bolsheviks did not create Russia (whose majority populous they hated, according to Solzhenitsyn); they created the Soviet Union. Although partially purged from leadership by Stalin, the tribe remained mostly loyal Soviets up until the time that country entered its terminal decline.  As to the nuclear question, you might ask the same of every NATO leader except Orbán. The supposition is that those who influence Western policy are implacably hostile to the West, just as they are hostile to Russia.

                        Because under Stalin (latter part of reign), Krushchev, and Brezhnev our favourite people were purged and otherwise dragged kicking and screaming from the levers of power they had worked so hard to get their grubby blood-stained mitts a-hold of.
After that, it’s just Milton’s Paradise Lost in their grubby pus-stained imaginations.

                        Interesting, @Zaphod. I have no idea what the Jewish story of that time was, but it hardly surprises me that they might have exaggerated things a bit. OK, a lot.It’s not that Jews were discriminated against , but rather that a disproportionate amount of Jews were Zionists, (a “reactionary” movement) and USSR was desperately trying to avoid a brain drain. The non-Zionists largely retained their positions. The Soviets of the day even used their example to show how anti-Semitic the West was.But, yeah, if the Jews created a completely different story, I guess that would do it. Do you know when this mythology started, by chance? My recollection of history class in the ’70s still emphasized how well Jews were treated in USSR.

                        @steveYou’re correct that the Soviet Union was no more antisemitic than is the Russia of today. Although both found it prudent to remove them from the upper echelons of power. I think the emergence ofrefusnikslargely dates from the dying years of the Soviet era.

China makes no sense, either. Why wouldn’t antagonizing China result in sanctions? Currently our official policy is One China. Wouldn’t becoming a belligerent be cause for China to doubt our sincerity, and flex their economic muscles?

            Never, EVER underestimate the hate hate hate, the fury, of Woke Rich White women against ordinary White guys. See the Titiana McGrath character running NPR, Katherine Maher. Full of woke tirades against White men who she hates. Married to some Indian guy. The hate is strong in her.Pretty much most of the Corporate world, NGO-istan (CIA cut outs), Government, and the mid to upper tier of management throughout is filled with Katherine Maher types. Spouting “Truth gets in the way of woke!” and such. They just reflexively HATE White guys and everything they built. They HATE ordinary White guys not “knowing their place” and hitting on them when young, and Alphas not committing when they are older.About 80% of the sheer lunacy of the Managerial Elite comes down to the female fury among Woke Rich White women that ordinary White guys still exist. They also assume that the Gulf War in 1991 can be repeated at will despite a bunch of illiterate goat herders on motorbikes chasing the US out in a blind panic of Afghanistan.

                No doubt. But evolution dictates that when their people are defeated most women will readily adapt to the newcomers. Our advertising helpfully suggests some of their available options. Notwithstanding, most white women still show a strong ingroup preference. You can decide for yourself if this is more due to solidarity or the fact that we’re not yet fully defeated. The continued existence of the Afrikaners or the creoles of Latin America suggests there is some room for optimism.

        At this point everyone with a room temperature IQ knows the grim reaper is hovering over the US, waiting out the inevitable while preparing for the funeral is the most preferable option. If the US implodes before the rest of the non NATO world is economically shored up everyone is gonna feel it &amp; nobody wants that. The same goes for war with the US, no point in expending energy on an enemy who’s committing slow motion suicide.Problem is israel &amp; at least some elements of the ruling party in the US are also aware of this. They both have bucket lists &amp; as things decline the window to fulfill those things narrows which is going to lead to ever increasingly unhinged behavior.That recklessness is testing the patience of all those muslim countries &amp; their citizens in particular. The leaders may want to wait it out but the people sure as hell don’t, if it were up to them they’d join the yemenis in attacking israel &amp; the desire for such action is only going to grow. It remains to be seen whether the leaders of those countries can keep a lid on that while also avoiding being deposed by radical elements who care far more about jihad than geopolitical concerns.Then, as this article describes, there’s the incompetence wild card, stupid people are inherently chaotic &amp; unpredictable. That we have morons who are utterly detached from reality in charge of maintaining the extremely fragile &amp; rapidly decaying modern western world it’s really a question of when, not if, they’ll pull the jenga piece that brings the whole system down.Seems like it’s going to be a coin flip as to whether israel drags the US into a regional conflict that spirals out of control or the US finds itself in an existential crisis that cannot be fixed by printing more money. The latter could take decades to happen but the former could happen later today for all we know given how emboldened &amp; motivated netan the yahoo is to fulfill the greater israel prophecy.

            Good question. The US ICBM program started with liquid fueled rockets then transitioned to solid fuel rockets. Solid rocket fuel is easier to deal with logistically. They can also be kept on standby indefinitely without worrying about fuel boil off. Liquid fuel is generally more efficient though, and can be throttled for precision targeting.

            Control. With solid fuel, the reaction happens only on the fuel surface, meaning predictable acceleration, and is digital — full power until the fuel is gone, then no power. With liquid fuel, it’s powered flight can be easily adjusted.

            Modern ballistic weaponry missiles are multistage. Typically a solid fuel motor is used as the initial booster, burns consistently and completely while pushing the missile upward into an initial trajectory toward its target. Then there can be a secondary solid fuel booster if the intent is to get very high into near space conditions (effectively no atmosphere). As the missile descends in a thin atmospheric environment, it will accelerate by gravity to hypersonic speed and start glowing like a meteor when it then reenters the atmosphere. Now this is the interesting part, the final missile stage can incorporate a liquid fueled motor which is fully controllable and allow for evasive maneuvering and final terminal guidance to the target. Last, there are many types of warheads available that can be used. High explosive is the most common, but deep penetration bunker busters are also extremely deadly. Russia used one recently in Chasov Yar on a subterranean command center 50 meters deep and killed a large complement of senior offices including a Polish general.Iran has now proven that it can attack the nuclear reactor at Dimona and create a Chernobyl in Israel if they resort to nukes. Gamechanger.

        The persians won that round by demonstrating that they can deplete israeli  , and US air defenses.  the cost of a patriot battery is $1.1 Billion. , thats with 4 alunchers and a complement of missles. the missles cost $4Million each.  the iranian drones are about $50K  each. an 80 to 1 cost advantage for the iranians .https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/05/23/war-in-ukraine-what-is-the-patriot-missile-system_6027705_4.htmlThe othere kicker is even if you print the money to buy more patroit missles , the only plant where they are made can produce max 550 a year .Before drones , the plan was to send the $4 mil missle at a $50 mill fighter jet , so it made sense. . but those days are gone.As far as the israeli nukes go , they know that the paki’s have nukes too, and they cannot nuke a muslim country without risk.  remember that samson died too. So despite the bluster , they will not start a nuke war.I sure looks like Bibi’s settker coalition wanted ths to provide cover for more land grabbing in the west bank. They are doing that , and nobody is reporting on it .

        How is all of this not predictable? The Clintons elevated DC criminality into a master course. George Bush was as dumb as a box of rocks and everyone knew it. Obama was the biggest fake-out ever to be elected president and Trump-The-Master-Con Man was utterly conned by the Deep State and hired his own executioners. Need I say again that current occupant shits his pants.This tidal wave of leadership disaster has a root cause. Once you combine a truly stupid electorate with rampant vote-buying and institutionalized vote fraud, you automatically get corrupt and deceitful actors posing as politicians and using their office to enrich themselves rather than run a country in the interest of it’s citizens.And to put the final nail in the coffin, a majority of Americans still believe that we can vote our way out of the mess we’re in. Mass stupidity is a consequence of prolonged affluence and the death of evolutionary culling. Those chickens will come home to roost and no amount of self-delusion will stop that.

                    Right. COVID is why I doubt I have a solid 10% who support a white ethnostate in my own AO. Tell them get jabbed or get fired, and I highly doubt their resolve. Tell them they need to present a jab ID card to get into the grocery store and almost all will fold. And folding on that is a direct personal risk. Now over some principle that doesn’t?

            Bush the Wrinkled beat Slick Willy hands down.It was his Chief of Staff from his time as VP , Craig Fuller whose company was  paid $25m to get the US to start a war on Iraq. It included the suborning of perjury with the daughter of the Kuwaiti Ambassador testifying before Congress that she was a nurse who had seen Iraqi soldiers throwing babies out of incubators to die on the floor because Iraq was so backward it didn’t have any of their own.Fuller should have been hanged to treason.

        “Modern war is fought on the balance sheet and Iran can now fight on that front.”
Balance sheet and scientific/technical skills. Ukrainians lasted this long because of their old Soviet school training. Iranian technical education is top class as well.
West, on the other hand, had been replacing real science with “climate science” and DEI, while importing skilled labor from the eastern block since the walls came down. That well dried out.

        I think you are too sanguine Z-Man. Certainly Bibi wants/needs War. Without war and the escalation the Color Revolution the CIA has been waging against him will be successful. Certainly the Iranian Leadership wants/needs War. They have domestic dissent mostly because the path upward in social mobility is closed off to all but the high ranking officers in the IRGC and various regime-aligned Mullah families. Much like here. Certainly the MiC and all those retired generals and admirals who sent an amicus curae to the Supreme Court (basically threatening a coup if Trump is not sent to prison was the under-tone message) want War. So too do various elements of the neo-con Warhawk community: Miss Lindsey, Speaker Johnson, Mitch the Turtle, etc.However Barack Obama DOES NOT WANT WAR WITH IRAN. So that has been decisive as Obama is still running the country, such as it is. Obama’s main policy has been hatred towards Israel as filled with ((())), being black and all, and conciliation towards Iran as the enemy of both ((())) and YT. He’s black, y’all. He has the reflexive HATE HATE HATE of the Third World aristocracy towards anything White, regardless of flavor. As long as he wields power within the Party and National Security State (and he does, very much so, he was installed by them), there will be no War with Iran.However, Bibi has other ideas, and likely so too do the Iranian leadership. War with Israel cannot be discounted either. Palestinian protestors wreaked havoc in the Golden Gate Bridge, various NYC bridges, tunnels, airports, fought the NYP, and tied up Chicago’s O’Hare airport. They were organized, funded, and bailed out by the Obama wing of the party including Soros. There is HUGE pressure in the National Security state to strike out at Israel, “for the Gazans” but basically to keep the Coalition of the Ascendant in place by expelling the main rivals to blacks and muslims: ((())). That was what the whole BLM vs. ((())) at Harvard, MIT, Penn etc was about. Blacks want the positions and power of ((())) and are making their move aligned with muslims. [It has nothing to do with us of course, no ordinary White person will ever get within miles of Harvard or power positions.]After all, the Brandon regime gave it’s “OK” to Iran to attack Israel, so long as it was within certain limits. THAT is a function of domestic politics, the Party working its way through to expelling ((())) from positions of power and influence as they “belong” to the black/muslim emerging coalition.

            Jews on the left (i.e. most US Jews) backed Obama to the hilt with money, media, etc. Rahm Emanuel is a full-on Zionist who volunteered for the IDF. David Axelrod is Jewish. Valeria Jarrett – also Jewish – was the real power behind the throne during the Obama years. Obama owed EVERYTHING to Jews. Even Jeremiah Wright complained “Dem Jews won’t let me see him!”So during the Obama years we had an essentially hands-off approach to Israel.

        The obvious stage managing of the Iranian “retaliation” shouldn’t surprise anyone here. One wonders if Civnat G. Normiecon sees through it. Probably not, or he wouldn’t be who he is. But it underscores that any and all of the news from the war theater can be fake. Even the parts that look real. Especially those parts, sometimes.“when will these imbeciles run out of luck”……. I’ve posited before that the BRICS stand to lose as much from a GAE collapse as many others do, and are thus incentivized to prop it up and enable it in some ways. We could be suffering under this regime for a lot longer than we think.

            “I’ve posited before that the BRICS stand to lose as much from a GAE collapse as many others do…”———————————————————-A spectacular thought and some clear thinking.I wonder though, Jeff – isn’t the idea behind the BRICS to set up an alternative economy that ultimately intends to replace the American hegemony when it fails?Our esteemed blog host said that wars are fought on balance sheets and profit margins as much as in the battle space. I would tend to agree… but even the most rat faced, money-grubbing neocon jew has to see that the numbers aren’t adding up anymore.The only guys making money in the Kraine right now are the grifters and a few oligarchs… and their profiteering is suicidal in nature. Back in the day when I was at war with the corporate bean counters I’d often tell those fart suckers that if they wanted to have the best month in company history – close the doors, lay everyone off and sell all the assets. The bottom line will look great!I get the feeling that that is exactly what we are doing today… and that when we fall the BRICS will step in and make out like bandits.But… whadda I know…?

                Brics is at least partially a Chinese psyop.  China and India are almost as likely to get into a war as China and the GAE.  There is absolutely no love between these two countries.  Though they are playing somewhat nice with BRICS for the moment, they know/believe China is a much bigger threat to them than the GAE.Also, Brazil and South Africa are not exactly world powers.  China is facing a lot of its own problems as well.  We tend to focus on the GAE because we live in the GAE or in allied countries of the GAE.  We see many of its flaws up close and personal. But the “BRICS Alliance” has a ton of problems too.

        I saw a bunch of headlines today claiming Israel has made up their minds that they will retaliate.  How much of this is theater, I cannot say.  But they are certainly at least pretending they are going to retaliate.  Supposedly, Iran has threatened an all out attack if Israel does the smallest invasion.  I find that wording strange.  Russia does stuff like this too.  They’ll say something that kind of sounds like a threat, but with giant qualifying loopholes you could fly a 747 through.Let’s just pray that the Russians, Iranians and Chinese are not yet willing to openly challenge the clowns.

        Foreign policy, like science, progresses one funeral at a time. We’re going to need total generational change here and abroad to break this cycle. There’s nothing amusing about watching Biden (81), Netanyahu (75) and the Ayatollah Khamenei (85) play with our fate.

        “The question that arises from this is when will these imbeciles run out of luck and do something from which they cannot be saved? ”
I suspect, unfortunately, a massive, visible, direct defeat of the US military.  Say the sinking of one of the vaunted carriers in the fleet.  The US military is the one “go to” all the Boomers use when touting the USA—this despite the obvious destruction/deterioration of its capability from DIE.  We should note, the commentary here in this group is not reflective of general thought wrt US military capability by the man in the street.

Presumably the MIC’s purpose is to spend vast sums losing wars to savages while utilizing the most complex and expensive gear possible, financed by back-breaking debt and brokered by grifter politicians.

                All too true, but there is another aspect to our military spending priorities—to compensated for a deteriorating civilian population pool.  A lot of the high tech gizmos researched are to replace poor human capital that we have to field.  As readily noted, only 25% of the population of appropriate aged civilians are even able to be accepted for enlistment—and many of those wash out or decline the honor of enlisting.For example, one aspect of R&amp;D has been for years to replace the aging M-16 rifle platform.  The replacement desired to be a rifle that can be pointed at the enemy and basically hit the target without much aiming and riflemenship—auto ranging and exploding bullets.  Women have been tested for sci-fi type exoskeleton experimental suits to add strength so they can lift ordinance into trucks.  And so forth.

                Perhaps, but rather I hope for a renewed understanding of our limitations and a retreat/return to our hemisphere.  In short, a renewal of staying out of other’s affairs rather than world policeman.  Trade, fair trade, is fine.  Gunboat diplomacy not so much.

            It’s pretty clear from the Houthi fiasco that the GAE Navy can now only threaten nations who don’t/can’t care about being threatened (Haiti, etc).  Finding defeat without any sinkings is, in many ways, worse, than finding it after a sinking.  A couple hundred thousand in ordinance is now more than enough to keep the USN away from one’s coast.

                There are certain land, sea, and space-based targets that, if destroyed, would be considered akin to a nuclear strike on US soil.  Our adversaries know this, and they operate accordingly.
If anyone goes after a carrier, it’ll be under the guise of some unattributable non-state actor surreptitiously paid for by a major power.
Like a terror attack on a pipeline or a concert hall…

        It is the nature of elites to grow complacent over time. Freed of the need to fend for themselves, they put aside their personal libraries and pick up their game playthings. Like a child who has too much time on his hands, the elite member grows bored, irritable, easily distracted.This general state of ennui continues until the next intra-party turf war — so exciting! Who’s the next person to fall from Grace for violating the orthodoxy?When Tucker Carlson lost his halo at Fox News, it was a sign that no one was immune from management games. Politics has become like one giant Fox News network, with in reporters and out reporters and hot trending topics of the day. Sober, considered deliberation has gone out the window.

        I was trying to find a segue into this story, but could not find a way to do so smoothly.
So, off topic, but I found this book &amp; interview quite shocking. I missed the opportunity when our host had a piece on our government’s lying.
First the interview:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk0ihHyq2U0
Then the book:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CXLN1PX1/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1
I believe that i’m as cynical as anyone here but i was shocked to hear that my government did this.

        Some of the more reliable commentators have said a couple of the Iranian missiles had hypersonic glide warheads.  The West has no defense against such weapons as the Ukrainians have found out.It was also posited that Iran used about 1/2 of 1% of their available weapons.  Imagine the escalation potential.  Even the cheap drones must be defended against as they can hurt you as well.   In the Red Sea the Houthis, for instance, win every time they fire one of their garage made cheap missiles.  The West must launch at least two multi million dollar defense missiles against every one of them.Then there is the Dimona nuclear power plant. According to some military people If that plant was hit by a few of the more advanced missiles it could work out to be similar to a nuke strike in the after affects due to Israel being so small.So the game has changed.   Israel and the U.S. will have to adapt.   No one in the area is out of range now.   The good news is, as Z Man points out, someone in the blob may actually understand this.   Or, it could have been just luck.   Hope springs eternal.

                The point isn’t that they hit Dimona; it’s that Iran could hit Dimona. Israel always holds its nuclear weapons over everyone’s head in the Middle East. Now, Iran can effectively nuke Israel.
Israel is back in the conventional warfare game, where it’s at a disadvantage. Israel now must deal with its neighbors as equals instead of being a little bully with his big brother.

                        We have become aware that the image that our  iseael loving media may have misled us in the past to the natur and capabilities of the iranians .Also, the persians are not the arabs. basicly there was a lot of religous overreach there in the 80’s to cunter what they forsaw as the destructive decadence of the GAE .  Time has shown them to be partially justified. Iranian men cnt wear sundresses and chase ther schoolboys arround and they are not lopping the breasts off their tenage girls and chemically sterilizing them . So there’s that.

                        “So call me naive. Has the discussion changed from Iranians being a bunch of post-apocalyptic hotheads looking for the sixth imam to show up. Or are they some sort of steely eyed real politk operators looking to change the world. I look forward to hearing what folks think. I was always under the impression that religion was the motivator.”There is no culture more religious than Western society. Apocalyptic hotheads trying to implement the paradise of the religion of freedom, equality and democracy using bombs. Millions of people have died to honor these goddesses. We kill or mutilate our kids for them.Even the most extreme Taliban guy, knows deep down that there are people that don’t want the same things that he wants. He calls them “infidels”Most westerners (unlike us, who comment here) don’t have this minimal awareness. When they go to Afghanistan, they think that Afghan people want the same religion as us (freedom, liberty, equality).A Taliban killing people does not think he does it because infidels, deep down, want Islam.A Westerner killing people thinks he does it because they, deep down, want democracy, even if they say the opposite.There is no religious fanaticism more extreme than that. We see the mote in other culture’s eye without noticing the beam in one’s own.

                        Iranian men cnt wear sundresses and chase ther schoolboys arround and they are not lopping the breasts off their tenage girls and chemically sterilizing them . So there’s that.Iran along with Kazakstan has the highest rate of male genital disfigurement in the world, around 99 percent. Higher than Israel. Going by that, they are fanatics. Good military strategists tho, it seems. Fair play Iran, you rock at geopolitics!IMhO they (Iran) are NOT controlled by a global cabal as posited above, that this whole thing is “reddit war” (colorful phrase). Russia, Iran, China, these are peoples with looooooonnng national identities, and they are acting accordingly, albeit very carefully not to upset GAE more than necessary.

                        Okay, so in your opinion, we’d been lied to or understood  about the whole “Death to the Great Satan” thing. They are realists who are interested in making Iran a regional power. They do have a conservative outlook WRT gender and familial consent. Where do I sign up? Not trying to be an a-hole, but I still question the motivations. Let’s face it, Israel was founded on religious terms and the whole area is flooded is religious passion.

            I am a bit skeptical that the Iranians have what is being called hypersonic technology. It does appear their ballistic missiles left the atmosphere and the warhead reentered. The warhead would have reached such speeds, which means they have the material science to produce a warhead that can withstand those pressures. In other words, they are on the cusp of having an ICBM.

                The articles I read were skeptical as well but somehow from videos they came away with that conclusion, I am no expert.  They doubted Iran came up with the hypersonics themselves.
So I guess without saying so they are alleging China or Russia may have provided the tech.

            Bin Laden allegedly did not target US nuclear power sites – they EASILY could have – because it would have spun out of control.  A not small number of Americans – myself included – felt the best 9/11 response in Afghanistan was to incinerate Kabul.
But there was no money in that.  Better to engage in a losing land war in Asia to replace the Taliban with…the Taliban.
The Israelis would turn Iran to glass and kill every Iranian man, woman, and child in the process.

        If you are downwind from a nuclear powerplant, you should know that one way to boost your protection against radiation is to eat fermented foods. The Russians discovered after Chernobyl that the people of one village who consumed a lot of probiotics suffered no radiation damage while the inhabitants of neighboring towns who ate unremarkable diets suffered grievously from cancer and the like. Theories for why this works include the increased antioxidant activity in fermented foods which suppress free radical damage and reduce carcinogenesis; the impact of a robust gut microbiome on the immune system; and the ability of probiotics to repair DNA damage.

            Don’t know about fermented foods, other than that Korean horror, Kimchi.  However, is the eating of such after a nuke strike, too little, too late?  The village you cite was eating such for a long time before and after radiation exposure.

        “The question that arises from this is when will these imbeciles run out of luck and do something from which they cannot be saved?”
Given that our “elites” consider themselves financial geniuses, I think the collapse will come from that area. Maybe the Federal Reserves will blow up and “all the kings men and all the kings horses” will not be able to put together the system again without “elites” taking massive haircut.
Also, the system is US appears closer to Paris 1789 than Moscow 1989. That is just my hunch. Don’t buy guillotine stocks based on it.

Has it?  Seems to me we went off the deep end post WWII, and particularly after the Civil Rights Act.  That really would put us on a similar time line as Russia after their Commie Revolution.

                Good point. Depends upon how you define “America.” The original 1787 version only lasted 78 years. The Lincoln version only lasted until the New Deal. The post-WWII GAE/”Civil Rights” version is pretty ripe at this point…

        It’s not so much cooler heads prevailed as much as there’s really very little we can do. For all out military budget, our capabilities have become shockingly limited. We can do a sustained bombing campaign, but that will have real casualties and repercussions. There’s no way we can muster up an invasion force which leaves us  with the two options of nuking the country or color revolution. I’m sure plans for the latter are going on overdrive now.

            Our inventories are largely empty.
Our missile production would take years to replenish what was expended to defend against the recent Iranian strike.
The sole plant producing 155mm and other artillery ammunition in Scranton just experienced a significant fire.
Hard to fight a modern war without any munitions.

            The reason why our defense budget is so bloated is not only the cost of maintaining a giant, worldwide empire and defending defeated satrapies, but this “good idea fairy” mentality in procurement.The military tends to go for a great technologic leap or tries to cram too many requirements into one “joint” system where you get the old story of a camel, a horse designed by committee.The F-35 program is one example. The whole airplane’s design was due to the requirements for the Marines and the UK to have a V/STOL (vertical/short takeoff and landing) aircraft, which are ruinously expensive to develop and procure. The differences between the V/STOL and CTOL (conventional) variants were advertised at the beginning at near 85%, but now it’s probably around 40% or so, almost making the B-models a different airplane than their A- and C-model cousins.Upon further reflection, it would’ve been FAR easier to just let the services design and build their own separate aircraft, but the Marines likely wouldn’t have been able to develop a V/STOL aircraft on their own.The requirements change constantly and contractors are forced to adapt as the customer changes its mind seemingly on a whim.Despite issues, the F-35 is a worldbeater as an air superiority and strike machine, but at what cost? When it can be possibly shot down by a $100,000 40mm antiaircraft gun or blown up on the runway by a $10,000 disposable UAV, is it worth spending trillions in taxpayer funds to build and maintain a fleet of these planes?Another example is the Navy’s new frigate, that was intended to be an off-the-shelf replacement for another flawed ship procurement program.A new generation of managerial morons at the Navy thought it’d be a good idea to build a frigate-sized ship using civilian ferry designs as a base. This so-called Littoral Combat Ship, better known as the Little Crappy Ship, would have empty spaces for mission modules that would allow one of these high-speed, relatively unarmed ships to sail into a port, swap out these container-sized modules and voila, you have a frigate capable of attacking surface ships or an sub-hunting ship.The mission modules and the ships themselves were never worked and the Navy now has these empty ships with tiny crews who can’t maintain or fight them if we went to war.So the Navy wises up, right? Wrong. They select a foreign frigate design, the FREMM from Italy and France. Originally our version was supposed to have 85% commonality with the FREMM. Now the frigate is going to be three years later than planned and has 15% commonality with its forebear.The Navy claimed that the FREMM wasn’t up to its survivability standards, but when your alleged “pacing threat” China is putting a new destroyer or frigate into service seemingly every day, do you really want to have perfect be the enemy of the good?The problem is none of the people in the procurement arms of the services ever pays the price, with their job or their freedom, for these FUBARs. Until the procurement divisions of the DOD are completely replaced by new people with fresh ideas, this BS will continue.

                Mantis,What an interesting comment.You say:The requirements change constantly and contractors are forced to adapt as the customer changes its mind seemingly on a whim.And this is no doubt true. In every industry I have worked, this has been the case. There also be a tendency (particularly in software) to over-generalize: your program that was already designed for task X must have support for tasks Y and Z. I see this as being similar to your statements about the ‘modular ship’, the LTC.The issue of modules fit to be swapped out is another thing one sees in the software development world. Often with the goal of making something completely general… what the devil is wrong with specificity? I guess it’s also hard to design some combat vessel when the state-of-the-art is also changing so rapidly. New advancements come along, andpeople simply must have them, my dear chap!To the question of cost, I also suspect you’re right. I recall reading of development and maintenance costs of the B-2 Spirit bomber, and thought that in a proper, hot war, how gutted you’d be if a bunch of surly enemy special forces just turned up at the hangars and blew them all up. Probably a bad example, but you get the point.A old neighbour of mine was an avionics engineer on the Eurofighter Typhoon; he was, in the end, so tired of the tedium of maintenance and the difficulty of getting parts he quit when his time was up. This plane was (and I imagine others are) completely dependent on a huge network of interoperating people. Of course, you’re never going to eliminate this completely, but I couldn’t believe the work that went into keeping a single Typhoon ready!In any case, I prefer the Navy of old: havingUSS Missouricrack out a broadside always seemed impressive to me.

            The days of giant land armies invading large swaths of territory are gone.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine involves armies a tiny fraction of the size of WW2 and a shockingly tiny piece of land.  Ukraine is about the size of CO/KS/NE.It’s too easy to strike behind the lines these days.  Lack of manpower is a problem.  And modern weapons can neutralize manpower.The destructive power of weapons and terrorism make big continental wars increasingly unlikely.  Daylight bombing in Germany and two nukes on Japan brought those wars to a swift close.The beauty of the failure of sanctions is that interconnected nation-state economies have become even more interconnected…making large continental wars that much more impractical.Every war since has been a small scale regional or low intensity conflict.Taiwan will be next, but I suspect the US will stay out of it.  Taiwan probably has nukes, so there will be a lot of bluster, but they probably wind up coexisting with China – but without the stupidity of US “two China” policy.

                “Taiwan probably has nukes, so there will be a lot of bluster, but they probably wind up coexisting with China – but without the stupidity of US “two China” policy.”Taiwan is at present “coexisting” with China, no? The stated goal of the present Chinese leadership WRT Taiwan, on the other hand, is to subsume the island polity and thus eradicate the last remaining vestiges of their old Kuomintang enemies from more than half a century ago, which speaks to a level of wounded pride bordering on insanity, given that Taiwan poses absolutely no threat to China except perhaps as an abstract symbol of China without the Communist Party ruling over all. It’s really the same sort of mindset that wants to push GloboHomo to all corners of the Earth, when you get right down to it.

        I’m not sure that the West fully understands what has happened over the past two years. We have moved to a multi-polar world for the first time since before WWII.Sure, the Soviet Union was a peer military adversary but never an economic one. It also stayed in its own world. The US was the hegemon for the non-Soviet world. The US was never competing on its own turf.The failure of the sanctions was the first blow. Now, we see that the US military is unable to push around any decent-sized opponent. The rise of missiles as the alpha predator means the US – a sea power – is incredibly vulnerable beyond its shores.As if that’s not bad enough, the US is undergoing demographic changes that will further reduce the empire’s ability to wage military and/or economic war. Whites are now a minority of military recruits. For the country as a whole, we’re moving toward Brazil-like demographics. There’s a reason Brazil isn’t a world power. That’s our future.In the blink of an eye, GAE lost its dominance.In regards to Israel, this is devastating. American power is Israeli power. Just as GAE has lost its dominance, so too has Israel. But unlike the US, which is blessed by natural borders and friendly neighbors, Israel lives in a tough neighborhood.Will the Jews be willing to work with their neighbors now that they can’t push them around? It’s not exactly in their nature. I’d suspect that the Israeli people are coming to terms with this new reality. Indeed, the whole world is coming to terms with the reality that the US is no longer dominant.The last people to understand and accept this new reality will be the American elite.

                        Yes. For far different reasons, the border state most likely to make a de jure exit is California, the one that got dirty first. The 2020 election likely was stolen due that very real possibility. You also have to note that California for all intents and purposes has a relationship with China separate and distinct from the one Washington has.  It very well might not go along with a conflict with that country.As for Texas, in many ways this actually is nothing new. It was in times past quite based on race, but always tended toward more leftist economic positions, which Arizona did not.

                    Texas has a very strong secessionist tradition and an independent streak that has yet to be eradicated. Most Texans, including a goodly number of Messkins, are more than amenable to ending it with AINO. Demographics are vitally important, but they aren’t everything. As is routinely noted in connexion with Finkels, a powerfully motivated minority is capable of overpowering an apathetic majority. When AINO begins capsizing, Texas, or at least its western reaches will be a part of the calving process. Bank on it.

                        Ostei:  Maybe the northwest, but that’s about it.    El Paso is now officially 11% White.  If the “western reaches” of Texas go anywhere, they will rejoin Mexico.  And yes, I have known a number of Texas “Messkins.”  A small portion have become ‘assimilated’ to AINO – marrying White, having their 1/2 or 1/4 kids/grandkids get expedited college acceptance and financial assistance as ‘minorities,’ and having a sexually degenerate kid or two.  Huzzah.  The VAST majority are first generation magic dirt.  Except the dirt in El Paso is exactly the same as the dirt in Juarez.

Again, you’re too locked into demographics. As I explained, there’s far more to Texas dynamics than that.
As for your experience with Texas Messkins, I dare say it’s ideographic. Having lived in West Texas 49 years, I can say without reservation that the large majority of them are not on board with the globohomo degeneracy you describe. Most are not rightwingers per se, but if it’s a choice between the DC freakshow and traditionalist Texas breaking away from AINO, they’ll side with the latter.

                        Ostei:  While my knowledge of and experience with West Texas is secondhand, my husband regards that as his “home town.”  Granted, he left many years ago, but quite a few of his friends stayed there, and he keeps in touch.  The racial stratification there has only grown as the Mexicans have swamped the place, whereas there was much more social mixing when they were younger.I will grant you that most of the Mexicans are not on board with the worst of the woke degeneracy . . . but they have their own.  Lots of sexual predation of children, lots of drunk driving, lots of posturing machismo, lots of ‘good enough,’ lots of racial pride.I cannot think of a single one who didn’t utilize his Mexican ‘heritage’ to gain advantage over Whites in education and jobs.  I cannot think of a single one where the more removed they are from Mexico, the greater their ‘pride’ in being officially non-White.  While they may well ‘side’ with Texas against AINO, Texas today and Texas tomorrow is NOT the Texas of the past.  It is majority Mexican in people and culture.  The White ranchers are mixing and/or dying off.  The city Whites are left and right coast liberals.My husband’s best friend just got remarried to a ‘lighter’ woman whose heritage is 100% Texas Mexican.  Yes, the family speaks primarily English, but they have retained the traditional values (primarily marrying other Mexicans, self-limiting opportunity by heavily pushing responsibility owed to ‘la familia,’ etc.).  Their “Americanism” has never been more than a patina over their racial pride and loyalty.Many may boast they are ‘proud Americanos,’ but in reality they are proud Mexicans who happen to live in SW Texas.  There is a huge cultural gulf, and it’s only widening.

                        3g,Nobody, least of all me, is claiming Messkins are white. How could they be? Could you be a Messkin? Of course not. And it’s unrealistic to hold them to the bar of whiteness. What I’m saying is that in the looming struggle between AINO and breakaway territories, Messkins in West Texas, in the main, will side with the latter. White secessionists can and should, therefore, utilize them as allies of convenience. And then, if needs be, we go our separate ways in the creation of new polities. If they really want to rejoin Mexico–and I doubt many of them will–we let them. But we’ll have our own redoubts too, and that’s what’s most important.

            Great comment. I would just add that I think the last two generations of Israelis were ideological about Zionism but pragmatic about problem-solving. I mean, no less a figure than Ariel Sharon kicked Israeli settlers out of Gaza (at great political cost to him) in the first place to set up the last truce. As I’ve said here before, I’ve met through business lots of IDF guys my age or older who fought in Lebanon and were strong “two-state solution” guys – just very practical guys.Bibi is an outlier in the older generation because he really represents ideological groups who have an eschatology driving their foreign policy. It’s on par with the Globohomo stuff driving US policy. My friend who worked with him at Bain tells me that Bibi is really just a management consultant at heart who won’t deviate from the PowerPoint.

But the arrogant asses who run foreign policy and the military [talk about sucking up to the prevailing orthodoxies], don’t realize it and keep treating other nation like they can boss them around and meddle in their affairs as they like.
Couple counterfactual ideas about human nature with arrogance and you get the reckless garbage of our foreign and national affairs.

        Covid was America’s Chernobyl. I don’t know if America’s Afghanistan already happened…there…but it cannot be too far off now. Trust has collapsed for the most part already.That out of the way…thank God. If it takes blundering into peace, more blundering, please. I’m not sure yet if the United States will avoid nuclear war with Russia. It has done so thus far only due to Russian restraint, which may have worn thin, and it is debatable Putin would engage in kabuki given the psychopaths here and his political considerations there. The hegemon bully may ramp up its violence in its dying hours or it may curl into a fetal position and whimper. The feminized failure that the United States has become is capable of either.

            I’d say that Covid and BLM gutted trust in the system, but there remained a trust in the military and the belief that we were still the dominant global power. GrillerCons still had something to cheer about.Afghanistan hurt that belief, but Ukraine and the Middle East will end it.The 20th century – the Jewish century – is finally ending. With the decline of the Global American Empire, Jewish political, financial and cultural dominance is also ending. Both the US and the Jewish elite (here and in Israel) will need to learn to work with people as equals.It won’t be easy. Neither Jews nor our Yankee WASP elite are great at just being normal people minding their own business. It’s just not in their nature. But their time has come and gone. The Russians and Chinese simply won’t allow them to play their old games.We can only hope that our rulers accept their diminished role in the world gracefully, which isn’t a word a normally associate with them.

                Great comment. State always has been under the thumb of the Yankee Puritan, Treasury predictably under the thumb of the Jew. The greatly debased Defense has been kept in check by its own incompetence and shortcomings lately. As loathsome as it is, the mostly Yankee-aligned Intelligence Community seems to be independent of these factions and actually in charge at times. I don’t even know that these factions can get on the same page and act rationally and gracefully but the Regime had better hope so.

                    Jack:  Sorry, but State hasn’t been run by WASPs or blue-bloods in decades.  Tons of Jews, women, and non-Whites.  Ambassadors who are political appointees can push pet issues (such as homo/female appointees by dems) but those who are career FSOs are often worse.  Full ‘citizens of the world’ and faux-sophisticated mentality.  They despise ‘moderate’ White Americans.The intelligence community was more Yankee-inclined in the past – partly because it had lots of Mormons with Yankee genetic roots.  But it, too, has gone the heavily diverse, non-White, sexually-degenerate route.No government organization resembles past stereotypes any longer.  The big change began under Clinton and it has continued full-bore ahead since then.  Everything is run by the Klown-world cabal.

            “Covid was America’s Chernobyl.”
I used to love this country.  Would have fought and died to defend it.
When my state forced my children’s (private) school to close in 2020, forced my children to wear muzzles when ALLOWED to reopen, forced ME to wear a muzzle in order to buy food/ go to church/ go to work/ get on a plane, and THEN mandated that I accept having needles stuck in my arm?
My rulers hate me.  I get it now.  The feeling is mutual.

            There is, of course, the delightful possibility that many US nukes won’t work due to poor maintenance and the general incompetence of the Pentagon…or that missile crews will decide that WW3 has no upside for them, and refuse to fire, which has already happened…,.

Because the people waking up to the fuckery have no political power.  If they will ever get it, who knows.  The one power they do have is to withhold their competency from the GAE, but that is easier said than done, and involves personal cost.

                    I’ve always thought that the operation had to be “cleaned up” because Maxwell and Epstein were getting arrogant and very sloppy.  They were practically doing the “Archer” thing where they’d go into the cocktail parties bragging about being secret agents.

            It seems like their roles have been reversed (or least the perception and narrative).
Israel is now saying crazy stridently radical religious stuff while committing atrocities and breaking international law (bombing and embassy).
Iran has done a very measured response that cost Israel a lot of money but no lives.  They are now talking deescalate and peace.
In can remember 1979 so this feels like the world turned upside down.

                This is a very important point. Americans may rightly harbor enmity toward Iran for the 1979 embassy violation, but then they clap like trained seals when Israel also violates a sovereign embassy.In the 1980s and 1990s I was a pro-Israel neocon. Yasser Arafat was a total nutjob — how could any sane person side with him?Like most Americans I was outraged at what those “fanatical towel-headed Muslim sand n___ers” did to MY country on 9/11. But I knew very little about Islam. When I started reading up on it, I understood that all the “Islam is peace” and “the terrorists do not represent true Islam” stuff from Bush and the American Establishment was bullshit, and that Islam had been a fanatical, homicidal religion dedicated to jihad from the beginning.“What the hell kind of religion is that?” I thought. Christianity certainly wasn’t founded on that kind of violence.But by taking major religions seriously, and by comparing them objectively, I began to realize that Judaism had more in common with fanatical Islam and that the so-called “Judeo-Christian” tradition that made it sound like they were just like us was false.Judaism, like Islam, also was founded on the principle that the believers have a God-given right to kill their enemies and steal their land. The Jewish holidays Passover and Purim celebrate God killing their enemies. Like the Muslims, the Jews do not give a damn about international law, treaties, modern Western conventions, or any of that. Western morality is (was?) Christian morality, and neither the Jews nor the Muslims give a hoot in hell about it.If you denounce the fanatical, homicidal Muslim nut, you must also denounce the fanatical, homicidal Zionist nut. There’s not reason why the U.S. should choose one side or the other.

                    And yet there are major differences between Finkels and Muzz. With the possible exception of ancient Judea, the Finkels never created a world-bestriding empire. Nothing close to it. They’ve never even tried.The Muzz, on the other hand, conquered about half of the known world–including much of Europe–in the early Middle Ages, and the Ottomans elaborated that process well into the 17th century. What’s more, in postcolonial times, they’ve been more than willing to visit mass violence upon non-Muzz in their own lands.Now the Finkels, in their own way, are every bit as pernicious as the Muzz and probably more so, but mass violence–the Isreali exception is noted–and conquest are just not their bag, and that probably has to do with the fact that the vast majority of them are secular. Hence, all those Old Testament injunctions to slay their enemies and revel in the lamentations of the women fall on deaf ears. I don’t worry about Finkels conquering New Mexico or flying jumbo jets into the Sears Tower, but I do worry about their banksters, professors and movie producers.

You can be that if the WTC had been constructed by the British or the Ottomans in the 1930s in Jerusalem they would have blown it up, though, just like they blew up the King David Hotel.

I still remember historical pictures of a modern Iranian populace where now we see women wearing bags over their bodies.  Shameful (on our part).Democracy be damned when it is not in our interest.  🙁

            Oh its definitely not over, Israel can’t just sit back and ignore Iran. I expect war after the US election, the alternative would be to try to undermine the Iranian regime and cause it to collapse, but that would take years and may not work. War also won’t workOne question the Israelis must be pondering, how many drones and missile does Iran have, whats the production rateIsrael finds itself in a real pickle, I’d suggest a peace deal, but thats not their styleEven with out a serious war, Israel is in trouble, any Israeli with a second passport it probably planning an exit, a trickle could turn into a flood

        The cooler heads that prevailed almost certainly came from the DoD, not the State Department. The State Department has been thoroughly infiltrated and co-opted by neocon fanatics, which is exactly what explains Nuland’s rise in the organization.The cooler heads in the DoD are likely the same group that engineered the buyout of Twitter by Elon Musk to wrestle it away from the State Department fanatics. The cooler heads in the DoD are acutely aware of the limitations of America’s military, which explains the recent de-emphasis of DIE propaganda in recruiting. They do not want those limitations exposed (again) on an international stage for all to see.Soros has been quietly buying up the second and third largest radio broadcasting companies in the US prior to the 2024 election, which presents a propaganda danger similar to Twitter. It will be interesting to see whether the DoD enlists Musk or another operative to buy them.

            Because of their white hats…
The idea that there’s an individual person, let alone a faction, with any power whatsoever in D.C., who isn’t a full-blown psychotic enemy of humanity and civilization, is the wildest “conspiracy theory” I’ve ever heard.

            Excellent insights (speculations?) Although it’s a frequent theme with our host, let us never forget that the easiest explanations for a faction’s behavior is often the most obvious, or what should be. You could call it “Follow the money (or the power).” Any entity’s primal instincts are to survive, to reproduce, and to expand its power. None of this is rocket science; it’s elementary psychology, biology, what-have-you. Indeed, they apply to nearly all living entities, to you and me. Less obvious is that they (usually) apply to groups and organizations. To use the cited DoD case, their putative reason for existence is to “defend” the nation. Oh really? In practice, it’s anything but. Stripped to its cynical essentials, it’s mostly about millions of individuals, whether military, civilian government or contractors obtaining and maintaining an accustomed standard of living. It’s also about carving out fiefdoms, whether one is a top defense contractor looking to preserve or expand market share, or a lower level bureaucrat or enlisted seeking to defend her turf from that basic bitch Becky in the next office.

        When will they run out of luck? This is the wrong question. Incompetency is a value to the managerial class. It gets them bailed out or bought out. Paydays all around.As an example, this week I was told by a big city executive that he didn’t know how his industry worked. He said this directly and almost with contempt for the dirts. His role, in his view, has not been to know or understand how the nuts go into the bolts. That is below his station in life. I’ll leave it to you to guess what he thought his job is.But for Zman: you have seen the movie Idiocracy, right? There is no end to human stupidity and incompetency. If the nukes ever fly, that executive will emerge from his hiding place, probably warned his advance given his connections, and immediately get to setting up a new governance system in America for the Chinese.

        The elites that run the Western apparatus, conditioned to think in binary yes/no black/white lines, have apparent difficulty with subtle shades of gray. This has been obvious as far back as World War 2, when American sanctions partly pushed the Japanese toward lashing out against Pearl Harbor. The sense that the U.S. may have had a hand in its own ruin was entirely lacking. In modern times, there’s a similar blindness about Ukraine; the historical ties that bind the Donbass and Ukrainians in general to Russia are entirely glossed over.Zman is absolutely right in pointing out that fidelity to the orthodoxy counts today more than raw ability, particularly on the Left. Virtue signaling is at an all-time high. When you are so busy jumping up and down on the sidelines waving the school’s pennant, there’s not much time to buckle down &amp; study.Enraptured by the sounds of their own voices on TV, and chained to an idea that says the image is all, these simpletons among the elite are as unlikely to have a personal library as they are to have tickets to a Country music concert.Say what you will about the Founding Fathers, they were a highly educated bunch. The erudition of Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson connects the two, despite their disparate worldviews. Could President Biden have contributed anything meaningful to the Federalist Papers in his own unique way? The last president who might have had a shot at it was Bill Clinton, and he was a bumbling skirt-chaser.There ARE geniuses out there today, but you’re more likely to find them in the comments section of a political dialogue site than perched among the high rafters of power. If a new elite is prepared to assume the mantle of governance, let them step forward.— Xloveli (dark.sport.blog)

        It’s quite possible that a few clear-headed individuals within the Pentagon also reminded the administration that we simply do not have the armament stockpiles at this time to sustain a regional Middle Eastern war. Having Americans on almost every fault line in the region doesn’t help either. The defense beast is breaking down like Blaine the Mono. (Dark Tower reference.)

        Neither the Iranians or the Biden administration want a war right now. The Iranians had to do something to preserve face. But they gave advance warning, And they didn’t aim anything at large Israeli cities. Netanyahu seems to want a war presumably only to save his worthless hide. Even so, the talk of retaliation seems to be coming not from Netanyahu but the Israeli president.
According to Jim Rickards, a little deal was done by the Iranians and the Biden people:

        Iran sent a very powerful message, not just to Israel but also to the United States. If a drone swarm concealing a ballistic missile can penetrate the vaunted Iron Dome, it can also make short work of an aircraft carrier group. This is a complete gamechanger, and it seems like nobody in the media or the establishment is talking about it. The united States does not have a sufficiently organized industrial base to develop an effective countermeasure for these drone swarms, so the loss of relative strength is permanent. The hegemon is finished.Off topic, I was very impressed by some of the comments on the post from yesterday. There seems to be a lot more awareness of the real issues among the commentariat here than there is at Sailer’s middle-aged fart factory. However, the contagion of HBD idiocy is still rampant and will need to be expunged.

            I agree it’s nuts to think we’re all 100% biologically determined, but I do think HBD is closer to the mark. One’s inheritance is what it is and can be developed, or not. Sad truth is that development is limited, except in the case of extraordinarily motivated people, which most of us aren’t. Most of us, if anything, play to our obvious strengths.

                The tranny and homo explosion cannot be explained by genetics, any more than it could be explained by genetics in the Weimar Republic. Physical traits, sure. Mental? Sure. Attitudinal? At the margin, sure, but generally, maybe some. Behavioral? Possibly none.Most of culture is rooted in tradition. Some of it is just superstition, but at least some aspects of culture are solutions to particular problems that society faced. African culture never evolved to solve problems that a civil society might encounter. Not having any experience with being in a civil society, they could at best do cargo cult approximations, but often relied on the old standby of African diplomacy — lining up at a distance and shaking their junk at the enemy. Which worked swimmingly at Roarke’s Drift.It’s not that HBD is wrong, just that it is applied too broadly and so gets a bad rap.

Well, yes and no.  If your genetics make you mentally weaker, then it becomes easier to manipulate your behavior.  At least indirectly genetics influence behavior (see time preference).

                        Oh, agreed, but if one can be nudged into a higher time preference, one can also be nudged into a lower time preference with the right conditioning regime.
Oversimplified to the extreme, but recent history demonstrates that people can be conditioned to keep more than a day’s worth of groceries on hand just by interfering with the “supply chain”.

        Spot on, Z.A small point of order though: the Russians have better rocket engines than we do; they burn at higher temps and pressures than ours do. Before relations soured between America and Russia, NASA was buying Russian engines for awhile.Hell’s bells… the imbeciles cut our throats long ago. It wasn’t a death brought about by one big cut, but a thousand smaller ones. I noticed a year back that the faggotry at Google were trying to impose a moratorium on AI research and development for military applications. In China and Russia, the nation’s best young scientists and techs are competing tooth and nail to get a place on the research teams. We are firing our best and replacing them with homosexuals, pajeets and blacks.It won’t be long, I think we are bleeding out as we speak…

            No longer true, the SpaceX Raptor engine beats anything the Russians have in all areas. I could also argue that the Merlin is a great engine too
The new Blue Origin probably beats the Russians too
The reason the US was buying rocket engines from Russia, was to keep Russian engineers inside Russia, the last thing you wanted in the 90s was the best Russian aerospace engineers moving to China or Iran for work. in the end the Iranians figured it out on their own

I can’t. But I can imagine that in China and Russia there is a clear vision of a very safe and well-remunerated and *honored* career trajectory for those that have potential in these types of fields.

        Even if Washington doesn’t understand the implications of the attack, Tel Aviv does. Surely they have at the very least advised their network of insiders in Washington know.This leads to the real issue. Who runs this country and how?Does anybody here know who runs this country and how?Speaking of which, last night I was watching an interview with Sam Dickson discussing Wilmot Robertson. I went to the US Census Bureau website to check a demographic claim and found nothing but a celebration of white female, black male miscegeny.It is the most organized government web site. It is fully up to date, works well, has clear statistics and data … … This is a well oiled machine. I think whoever runs this is fully invested in The Great Replacement. I’ve never seen a beautiful government website. Of course, this one’s beauty serves the pure evil of our dispossession.In any case this isn’t a tangent. I think we laugh off this Regime as incompetent to our peril. They are clearly organized, have a clear plan and the power to institute it across every institution. That plan is the racial dispossession and genetic destruction of European peoples. Go to that website and tell me it isn’t. Moreover, go to to Global Minnesota and Global Michigan websites. I didn’t have the stomach for searching for the Global Churches of the other 48 states.Tell me after seeing these that this Regime is incompetent. We better wake up. There is a thoroughly organized and well-oiled machine bent on your full annihilation and ensuring that you to pay for it.This is a great and insightful article. I just think our energies are misdirected.

            I agree that we should absolutely not, under any circumstances, underestimate our enemy.
But am of two minds about regime efficacy.
There are definitely nodes of extreme aptitude and cohesion, BUT I think that any organization or mission can hit a tipping point of too much ‘yes men’ where the masses of midwit diversity will cause too many problems too quickly for the people at the helm to control.
On the other hand, maybe their power is waning and coming to an end, BUT a dying animal is a dangerous animal.

            As for who is in charge: no one. I totally agree State is an evil hotbed of anti-whiteness and anti-Western philosophy and plans. Yet does its faction have the upper hand, and even if so, for how long? Healthy empires rely on their foreign services for obvious reasons, but fading empires have other concerns. We detect a lot of incoherence because the various factions are at war with themselves and even the most obtuse elements apprehend things have gone awry.
It is likely everyone here takes this monstrous Regime seriously, but its rapid decline also is undeniable.

            Reality, I think you’re absolutely right. The regime is not efficient or effective at winning wars, fixing the economy, roads, schools or anything else of actual value. Demographic replacement, OTOH, they are the most efficient in history.
If it is just stupidity some of what they do should be useful. Okay, temporarily avoiding a giant war in the ME was useful. What else of value have they done?
Incompetence is an insufficient explanation

            I don’t think regime incompetence matters much re: predicting their success (or ours). Their aims aren’t complex or nuanced. They’re criminal. The means to achieve them are simple and brutal. Violence is a *specialty* of the stupid. I’m sure there’s a “fallacy” that describes the mistake of thinking that, e.g., a black man can’t shoot anybody because he’s not smart enough to design a gun. Stupid politicians, oligarchs, or demographics can’t build a police state, but they can pick one up and point it at you.Still, we should harp on our betters’ incompetence relentlessly—say it every single time we see it—as a constant reminder that they don’t deserve to rule us. Can pointing it out change it? Probably not. It does seem too late. But the alternative is to dwindle out like Spencer or Sailer, licking the asses of regime idiots who hate and laugh at you, as everyone else turns away in disgust.

        “People might want to look up the nearest nuclear power plant and make sure you are not downwind.”
if dr phil show was correct about chinese buying US land near military bases then:
a)someone inside US government wants country to lose foreign warsb)US is so incompetent it might nuke itself
Either way, americans should consider getting out of dodge.

        I dunno. Maybe it’s for the best. This speeds things up. Folks say “… now the bad guys (Iran/Russia/China) have the measure of Israeli air defenses and can overwhelm them”. What’s to say the juice does not flip over the apple cart and glass a certain part of the world where this all comes from? Why wait for all the Russia tech to come on line in Iran? They will retaliate.

I’d be more concerned right now about being near a commercial airport, where planes are maintained by Cthuliqus and flown by Shenequa.
