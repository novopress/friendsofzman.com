        I agree we’re corporately stupid and overwhelmed with a sense of impotence at the loss of our heritage and the destruction of our nation.I don’t think the vultures of the political class are wise either. They are penny wise and pound foolish in pulling down the nation. It’s like the crooked bookkeeper with a drug problem. He could steal 20 here and 30 there for a bag of dope and get away with it, but instead he embezzles 50000 and goes down.I think Donald Fagan summed up the fate of the elite robbers in “Razor Boy”:“Will you still have a song to singWhen the razor boy comesAnd take your fancy things awayWill you still be singing itOn that cold and windy day”. When they pull the whole sucker down they won’t be able to build iron gates strong enough to keep the Barbarians out.

        Indeed Bones, I find myself staring glassy-eyed at the world and have had the requisite number of years to watch our civilisation become odious.  You are correct that outrage is difficult to sustain, and I suspect the perps knew this all along.

        The reason there is no outrage is very simple.  The sense of outrage in most people has burned out from the constant barrage of outrages over the last forty or fifty years.

        The opportunities for large-scale graft are one reason why the political parties will fight to the death to keep their people in positions of power, including corrupting the voting process and flooding the country with people who have no business moving here. All means to an end, and the end is not some version of political and social philosophy, but rather what can be quietly extracted from the system for private personal benefit.
