        The big technology companies are the most successful thing going economically in the United States; the Europeans, who have nothing to compare to a Facebook or a Google, resent them and fear them; Democrats hate them, blaming Facebook for the election of Trump in 2016.‚ÄùAughghgh! Facebook is not ‚Äútechnology‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs a shitty myspace clone written in a few weekends by a Harvard teen turned political sociopath once he had money rain down on him by the random hand of the network effect.The gas turbine is a technology. Optical tweezers are a technology. Photolithography ‚Äì what makes all the chips that spin all the software, without which Dorsey, Bezos, and Zuckerberg would be banging rocks together cargo-cult style! ‚Äì *that* is a technology.Our tech elite isn‚Äôt elite, and also isn‚Äôt technological. All the hard drives in all their server farms come from Thailand. The black boxes they plug together with no more understanding than a shaman for the weather are the fossil products of a class of people who no longer exist: Free, wealthy, respected engineers with lots of free time on their hands.

            it also doesn‚Äôt manufacture anything, so it doesn‚Äôt employ many people.   funny enough, because of that, the big tech companies are now moving out of cali because there is no need to be close to suppliers (because there are no suppliers!).

            I can see some‚Ä¶logic to being ruled by the likes of Microsoft and Apple since they have actual engineering staffs and release actual products.  I‚Äôd still hate them, but at least there is a value proposition that be argued in what they do.  Companies like Twitter, GoDaddy, Facebook, Amazon, Uber, etc. are just grift operations.  Their products are no more than ‚Äòroided up spreadsheets and to call them ‚Äútech companies‚Äù is like calling my house a ‚Äúnuclear power concern‚Äù because that‚Äôs what powers my morning toaster.

                        Tend to agree,¬† but rather than big software I think it is the over-reach of the Green energy pseudo religion and its almost certain failure that will put a good part of the world into what I‚Äôd call on a soft Dark Age.

                    It‚Äôs clear that they‚Äôre moving to Windows as a subscriber service where you don‚Äôt own any of it.  That should raise some alarm bells among the Libertarians, and the CivNats.

            Same for Twitter, Instagram, etc.And Google hasn‚Äôt really had a strong innovation in a long time.  A good search engine is nothing special anymore, nor is Maps.  They want to be an AI company, but are purposefully lobotomizing their algorithms in the name of social justice.As for web services with AWS and others, there‚Äôs nothing impressive about buying thousands of servers and putting them on a farm.They really don‚Äôt realize what a paper tiger our technology really is.

            I just watched what I think is a Spielberg movie, called ‚ÄúEnter Player One‚Äù.  I. Think. Anywho,,, the nerdy, socially dysfunctional tech wizard is held up almost like a saint.  It reminds me of a dot-head, Demi-nogger that was a customer of mine telling me how she LOVED and admired and looked up to Zuckerberg. I never heard anyone say that about a tech guy. But Jobs had a few movies made about him
My point is that there is a strange worship of these guys.

            I actually blame Microsoft for starting this trend and talking about all their shit ideas as ‚Äútechnology‚Äù. I think they started that in the 90s.Before that all technology could pass the ‚Äúkick test‚Äù.  If you can kick it, it‚Äôs technology.It was doubly infuriating to me because I knew that most of their ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù were just ideas other people had been doing for years which they renamed and sold to their moronic customers as something new.  I still get angry when I think about how they hyped up the fact their new versions of Windows could multitask ‚Äì 10 years after PC hardware supported it and other OSes like Linux hadalwayshad it.Ultimately, most of this new ‚Äútechnology‚Äù just boils down to various ways to expand the ‚ÄúThot/Simp‚Äù economy.  Sort of young, sort of attractive women need new ways to get sort of naked in slightly different ways on slightly different websites.  This is the supply (thot) side.  Then you have millions of testosterone challenged incel men, who need a way to pay these thots to keep producing jerking material.  This is the demand (simp) side.  Your novel web service is there to stand astride the flow of money and harvest a fee.  The problem is that there‚Äôs simply a maximum speed that all this can move.  How many boob shots can a thot take in a day? (10? 100?, surely it‚Äôs less than 10,000,000).  How much masturbating can a typical simp do?  Eventually the curve flattens, to use a recently popular phrase.

        From what I can tell, the conservative establishment is now just as respected among conservative people as CNN, NFL, and AOC. Just another annoying bleating cow to ignore.

They have no idea. They think everything is going back to normal. I heard the NFL is dialing back the African and rap content on tv broadcasts ‚Äì I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm not checking ‚Äì they figure out way too late.

Former conservatives are either checking out, or going dissident. Keep redpilling.

                Same here. I backed away from the NFL early this season, then turned on the Bears-Saints playoff game Sunday, because‚Ä¶well, I dunno, it‚Äôs the playoffs.

            The final red pill is identity.The anti-identity gatekeepers will fight to their last check from our rulers to try and stop whites from viewing themselves as a people. Luckily, the Left will shove that pill down the throats of whites, and there‚Äôs nothing the National Review or others can do to stop that from happening because the GOP has lost power.It was always going to end this way. The Left gained power by being anti-white and importing non-whites into the country to demographically overwhelm us. The GOP had two choices: Fight that plan (in which case, the GOP would have become the White Party) or disappear because of that plan.The GOP shills choose disappearance because they got paid to do that, and it would take decades for that to happen. That‚Äôs fine. But they‚Äôve run out of time. They no longer have power. They‚Äôre not going to get back into power.The GOP has no purpose anymore. The Left doesn‚Äôt need them to be the Washington Generals any longer. The Left has total control now. They don‚Äôt need to trick white people any longer.The GOP long ago purged anyone who would stand up for whites, so it can‚Äôt play that role. It‚Äôs over for them.

            I was thinking the same.  The site‚Äôs strength has been a pretty generous tolerance for commentators who call them out.  It even looked to me that after years of Ed Driscoll writing snark equating  left wing government oppression to right wing memes someone finally reined him in as the reply comments were getting worse and worse (or in our case, better).  It could also be that he wizened up which I doubt.Still, Reynolds doesn‚Äôt seem to want to run an operation like that, a normie punching bag operation where he stands in for the normie who dreams of going back to 2006.

            Same for The American Conservative.  I was a plank subscription owner back in 2002 mainly because I was always a fan of Buchanan (the co-founder) and (because of him) TAC was about the only mag on the right that opposed the Iraq war and dared call out the ((lobby)) behind it.  They stayed pretty true to that course until the Obama admin.  Then began a slow shift from paleo-con to the neo-con ‚Äúcan‚Äôt we all get along‚Äù camp. The last straw was round about 2014/15 when they cancelled Phillip Giraldi for daring to criticize ((the ones who shall not be criticized)) for attempting to assign blame for the chemical attacks in Syria in order to of course stoke another Mideast war.  I immediately cancelled 13 yr subscription.

        The one exception isthe piecethey get from Victor David Hanson, but he has no role in the editorial stance of the site. In fact, he is notable in being the last actual conservative writing for the site.Yes, I‚Äôm surprised that VDH is still there, to be honest. Even a couple of years back I recall reading one of his pieces there, nothing great, but it was in stark contrast to almost everything else presented at that site.What has unfolded since the election has opened the eyes of millions of people. Despite the rhetoric from their cult leaders, even many lefties are getting nervous about what is happening.It is always a good thing to remember that, no matter how down one may feel when scrolling through the news, much of it is just propaganda. Although sometimes it does feel as though there are few people with ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô (don‚Äôt really know a better term to use) values left‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to get out and talk to real people. Again, the shamdemic and the unbridled hatred of ‚ÄòThe TruempenFuerher‚Äô have allowed me to speak openly of things that many, even a year ago, would have thought horrid.

                        Yeah, well, so was I. At the time, many people thought the Muslims were the biggest threat to the West. We didn‚Äôt know we, ourselves, were the biggest threat to the West.

                No, not enough said. VDH is not your typical academic. He is a very learned classicist, historian, Greek scholar and does not deserved to be lumped is with the others. Check out his history books, from the Greeks to WW II.

                    His big point with Mexicans is that there hasn‚Äôt been enough intermarriage with White Americans.He also does the whole ‚Äúas long as its legal‚Äù bit.VDH only looks good in comparison to the traitors at NRO. Put VDH‚Äôs writing against Z-Man or any dissident writer for that matter. To the extent that he is good, he drives traffic to NRO.I don‚Äôt deny he is good on some aspects of dissident politics. But he is NEVER going to say ‚ÄúMexicans belong in Mexico. They are not us.‚Äù He will NEVER say Mexico is like Mexico because it‚Äôs full of Mexicans.He is a bow-tie wearing cuckservative on his best day.I think he‚Äôs either married to a Mexican or one of his kids are.

                Nonsense.  You obviously have never read or heard VDH speak.  He loves Mexicans?  Read Mexifornia.  He has been driven off his farm by illegals.  That he speaks in a softer tone perhaps than we here does does nothing to diminish his condemnation of the immigration situation.

        They have a lot of power but they‚Äôre also hysterical and panicking, which is a very, very bad combination. It could be bad for us but also for them. Taking part in most media consumption (and definitely financially supporting most media) at this point is like voting or public protest: you win (or at least hold them to a stalemate in this insane phase) by refusing to play at all. Don‚Äôt even comment on mainstream conservative sites since we should deny them so much as a barometer (they don‚Äôt care enough to listen but they are scared enough to eavesdrop).I‚Äôm not advocating doing nothing as a long-term strategy. But charging a battlefield this smoky is dumb.The results in Georgia scared the Establishment a hell of a lot more than Charlotesville. It was also more productive.  Also support the Ocasio-Cortez faction in their efforts to soak Pelosi‚Äôs Nordstrom neck scarf in chloroform, like they dumped Feinstein‚Äôs wheelchair off a cliff, and also when Donkey Choppers and her ragtag socialists try to slow production in Bezos‚Äôs fulfillment gulags.

            first off, why would anyone red pilled (or otherwise, really) spend even a second on sites known to be pozzed?!   because they long for the old safe slave life.
there is a way to have your cake and eat it too, kind of.   share credentials.  i know one set of credentials (for all premium OTA sites, like HBO+, etc) that over 50 people were sharing, for over 3 years ‚Äì and the owner of the credentials didn‚Äôt even know it.

                We are not going to war with China, they own too many reps. War with Russia will end up in nuclear fire , EMP weapons or worse.It will be Iran although maybe not that as they are tight with Russia right now.They‚Äôd love to go all martial law before the Deplorables organize but that‚Äôs a low probability item as they can‚Äôt trust the enlisted troops.

        We are ripe for a strong man, with all that entails both good and bad. It only takes a small fraction of a population to push an entire culture into madness or redemption.

                He still submits columns to them, although his output on National Review has dropped way off from what it was in the past.  Nothing so far this year and only two columns since October 1st.  In his case, he might have stopped submitting to them on his own.  What does a genuine immigration restrictionist have to gain from writing for National Review?  If anything it taints him with people who want to restrict immigration.

            Never any plans on bringing jobs and industry back.No, there aren‚Äôt. How would such a plan work when none of the common folk can visualize their offspring running a sheet metal break or a Bridgeport?

Their quest for white-collar ‚Äúskilled‚Äù (glorified data entry) positions won‚Äôt make their mundane lives more satisfied but at least they won‚Äôt get filthy at work that immigrants and survivors of the justice system will accept. No true blue Americano wants to do spot welds on SUVs or even run a silicon disc tool.

            He may still be there, but it seems based on increasingly rare visits to the fading Clownworld site that Mark Krikorian of the Center on Immigration Studies has lost his gig at National Review. He and his center are rock solid on reducing or eliminating immigration altogether. But, racist now. Also, as Z pointed out, immigration-reliant Big Tech throws the slop in the trough for National Review.

            At this point, if you‚Äôre not aware that manufacturing jobs are being lost to tech instead more than outsourcing, you‚Äôre being deliberately ignorant.
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-manufacturing-dead-output-has-doubled-in-three-decades-2016-03-28
Talking about industrial production jobs like it‚Äôs a work program is misguided. You may as well bring FDR‚Äôs TVA back. The improvements in physics application, robotics and technology mean that the demand for human labor has been radically decreased. Reversing the trend means a lower standard of living and the working conditions of the 1950s (or earlier).

                Consider two proposals: First, autarky, where a country tries to be as economically self reliant as possible. Second, that we have an economy to serve the people rather than a people to serve the economy.If we have a people who are more fulfilled by manufacturing jobs than service work then we structure our economy for that, even if it introduces economic inefficiencies.This means that the truck driver keeps his job even if driverless trucks are available and that a factory worker has a job even if robotics are available.We buy only the products of our country.

                    I completely agree that we should arrive for an autarky and providing meaningful jobs to citizens. I don‚Äôt think that onshoring all production is going to lead to as many new jobs as is believed, and I would bet that prices of common goods go up in this scenario, at least in the short-term. Furthermore, the incentive to automate probably intensifies because of domestic labor regulations.That said, the easiest way to increase domestic manufacturing jobs would be to impose a $10/gal. tax on diesel fuel and ban the production and use of eighteen-wheelers. The most natural consequence would be decentralized, redundant manufacturing with goods moving in small batches across short distances. When you think about it, it‚Äôs rather ridiculous that American manufacturing is so centralized and JIT given that the country has a relatively low population density. Redundancy is more useful than precision, yet government policy favors playing to our geographic weakness instead of strength.

                    Drew is right and doesn‚Äôt deserve down voting. Automation is a huge cause of job loss.Amazon,  Travelocity and Craigslist and the like are all job killers. Craigslist for example wiped out the entire newspaper classified industry, tens of thousands of jobs and replaced  them with thirty in total.However you are also right, autraky will help  though as stupid as our population has become and as deindustrialized as we‚Äôve become  hard would be hard to do.Also we have always been a trading nation other than a brief period a hundred years ago so it a painful cram down requiring a Goliath state to ensure that the ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather burn it down than pay wages‚Äù and ‚Äú1970 GM quality control ‚Äù crowds are handled.Over time though unless we do regulate work and labor, automation will continue to kill jobs that pay well.How we get back to the mod twentieth century  ideal of one worker household  30 hour work week is challenging doubly so when most good wage jobs are done by machines.A nation of waiters and service people is fragile as we are about to see.If we can‚Äôt manage it, the best solution is to instead seal the borders and let nature take its course. The population will freefall for a century or so and will than stabilize.

                Yet China still finds work for the Uighurs in their concentration camps and American corporations use millions of low-paid Asian workers.

                    I agree with you. But if we‚Äôre talking about make-work jobs programs, let‚Äôs call them make-work jobs programs. And let‚Äôs also be honest about tradeoffs with this approach: if we‚Äôre concerned about preserving certain forms of labor, we‚Äôll be at risk of being unable to pivot to improvements in tech and manufacturing because we‚Äôre trying to preserve the old ways of production.

                            The corporate addiction to efficiency is, ironically, what prevents new technologies like 3D printing and desktop robotics from being used to produce goods in small, less centralized shops.  Modern techniques can easily be adapted to make virtually every product a ‚Äúone off‚Äù.  Imagine shoes made to order based on a 3D scan of your feet just as one example.There‚Äôs another irony which is that ‚Äúgreen‚Äù fanatics and DIE (diversity, inclusion, equity) fundamentalists absolutelylovebig corporations because it‚Äôs easy to control a few big choke points than many small ones.  It‚Äôs also hard to argue that there are not economies of scale in everything from energy production to manufacturing.  If one values things besides ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù then there are other ways to do things.  It‚Äôs the things our society values that are THE problem. Which brings me to‚Ä¶The problem, of course, isn‚Äôt technology or the desire for greater efficiency, or even international trade.  It‚Äôs that virtually all decisions now in business and government are made by the same type of people.  Basically, if you put a deracinated, over-socialized and feminized clique in control everywhere, this disaster of a nation is what you get.

                            From what evidence I‚Äôve been able to find, American manufacturing output has increased and manufacturing jobs have decreased. What, besides automation, explains this?
Furthermore, if manufacturing is reshored, is it likely that manufacturers are going to automate as much as they profitably can? Or are they going to suddenly reverse the automating trend to maintain or increase the labor item line on their balance sheet?

                                Certainly they‚Äôll try to increase automation if labor costs rise. That‚Äôs fine. But lots of work simply cannot at this time be efficiently automated.This is not an argument for keeping that work offshore.Labor costs and the purchasing power of better-paid workers work toward equilibrium.I‚Äôd rather the work go to robots and machines built and maintained by Americans in American factories than Chinese and Mexican peasants.Onshoring won‚Äôt cause anyfewerAmerican jobs than offshoring. It will result in many more jobs, regardless of the level of automation.And, to repeat myself, a lack of immigration will cause a US population decline that dovetails nicely with future automation increases.It seems like you keep trying to argue against a mythical version of me that opposes automation.

                                As someone who has spent most of his adult life supporting manufacturing the whole automation thing seems ill grounded for a number of reasons.  First, lets just get this out the way: there‚Äôs not a lot of people who can do it well.  You‚Äôre going to be lucky enough to find someone who can feed material into a machine and push a button without blowing anything up.  Second, it‚Äôs radically expensive; yes it can pay for itself if it replaces expensive labor but it‚Äôs almost never that clean cut because‚Ä¶ Third, you can‚Äôt fire machines.  If you‚Äôre an apple grower and frost destroyed your crop this year the bank is still going to be looking for the payments on your expensive automated harvesting solution (a solution which is inevitablyalwayscustom).

They tried limited automation in the plant I support and they found the machines were simply not accurate or reliable enough to replace manual labor on our products at our production volumes.

I know of a Swedish consultancy that are excellent at industrial automation. Everyone of their staff are super sharp.

The one plant I have seen them operate is a very limited product mix.

                                    I do not disagree with many of your solutions  but I will remind you that the birth dearth began in 1972 when most of the negative conditions we face now were much smaller.A decent argument could be made that the natural low fertility was it in the 1930‚Äôs and that the after war boost was a bubble too.Planned obsolescence as a mainstream issue is  a hundred years old at least.These aren‚Äôt issues you can fix with policy tweaks. They are integral to the culture,Beyond that a DR Republic will probably come after a civil war with massive ethnic and political cleansing on all sides.This will inflict generational damage far more than say Russia which in 30 years of efforts has yet to get to replacement fertility and is using Central Asian immigrants for growth.Simply society has to be allowed to fall to a level it can sustain which for the US is a lot lower, 1910 or 1920 at best.

                    Yeah the automation claim is way over exaggerated.  China, india, and mexico comprise hundreds of millions of jobs that were born in the US.  More importantly, our tax payer funded US navy is protecting the global transport and supply chain for these foreign competitors goods for FREE.  Theres no way theyd travel safely across the world at a cost cheaper than our own products, without our own taxes paying our military to protect them.  Its a godamn clown world trade network burning us at both ends.

                It may be that automation has had a negative effect on the number of manufacturing jobs. However, allowing jobs to be moved offshore will clearly also have a negative effect on the number of manufacturing jobs. There is usually more than one reason for things happening in an economy.

        Funny stuff. Conservative, Inc., reminds me of Marco Rubio during the GOP debates. The fat Jersey governor called Rubio out for repeating canned lines, and Rubio responded with the very same canned line, verbatim, he had just recited.I listened to conservative talk radio just the other day for the first time in a long time. Someone was guest hosting for Limbaugh (Ken Matthews, maybe?) and the dude was dumb as a rock. He spouted things that could have been lifted from a 1984 GOP political consultant‚Äôs playbook. It was so disconnected from the present age it was jarring: 30-year-old lines about Hillary Clinton, references to Martin Luther King that have been discredited for a generation, and so forth. I also got the impression not many people were calling into the show as the guy kept pitching the phone number.These are heady times, indeed. The Republican Party sans Trump is dead. As you pointed out in a responsive comment, Progs who live in the real world are hearing widespread anger and dissent among normal people. Unlike Con Inc., the Left does listen to its foot soldiers so that message is percolating upwards. The fortified Imperial Capitol looks like a Disneyfied version of a drug lord‚Äôs Latin American plaza. The circus impeachment, featuring elderly Jews and assorted grifters, is a second-rate vaudeville act.I don‚Äôt know whether the rather tame storming of the Capitol was planned or spontaneous but it is the most successful psyop in recent history, and the hysterical overreaction has made it a perfect thing. Viking Man is by far more popular than any other public figure in the Banana Empire.To borrow some from a similar time: the whole world is laughing.The ascendancy next week of a dementia patient and a vapid, slimy whore will prompt the Fat Lady to hit her first note. I had been sad. Increasingly I am amused.

            I figured they did the communist dictator thing and pulled a bunch of uniformed troops into the capital but gave them plastic weapons and no ammo; but now I‚Äôm wondering‚Ä¶maybe not.  It would take a level of clueless unseen probably in the history of mankind to bring several battalions of fully armed soldiers in to guard the most unpopular government since the Civil War.  I mean, I‚Äôm sure it will work out for them, but if it doesn‚Äôt?  Well, that‚Äôs not the kind of mistake that you‚Äôre going to get a mulligan on.

                Interesting post. Where is our Man in DC to comment on this? I can only give you second hand: in the Vietnam years, on post, even in war zones, soldiers routinely were denied ammo. My guess is the same for the current mess in DC. Some units armed yes, but the average soliders? You gotta be kidding. I‚Äôm of course not privy to current troop strengths, but I think it‚Äôd be a Herculean task to even get 2,000 combat trained soliders into DC on reasonably short notice. Yes there are many military bases in the neighboring areas, but combat infantry or equivalent? Not much. Giving a typist, a cook or a tactical radio technician an automatic weapon, when he last touched one in Basic? Rather unlikely. In fact, what does this say about the readiness of our military, domestically? Lots of you have been in the services, you know how it was. Most of our combat ready troops are overseas playing in deserts for, well we‚Äôre not sure exactly what for, but we have worldwide presence. And, based upon my peace time service decades ago, virtually all active duty military domestically are probably less qualified for anything resembling warfare than your average redneck who has hunted deer.

            ‚ÄúIncreasingly I am amused.‚Äù




Me too. For some odd reason, our temporary fade from the world stage is reason for optimism. We are outnumbered, and our oppressors will turn their sights on each other.




Whites will hunker down, quietly beavering away in the background while Clown World‚Äôs vaudeville consumes itself. Our value will only rise as Nature‚Äôs cull reduces the overpopulation.




This is the social Black Death. Nature will not be foresaid. We will take heavy losses, yet rise from the ashes in greatness as we have done, again and again, since the Ice Ages.Weare Heaven‚Äôs will.

            Now that the insane left is in charge, Trump voters can now go on the offensive instead of constantly playing defense trying to defend voting for Trump.  Big fat targets for ridicule.  That is, if it‚Äôs still legal to do so.

        Just because one doesn‚Äôt have a living memory of some leading figure does not mean they can‚Äôt understand or even want to return to the politics of that time. Of course with Reagan I do remember and I don‚Äôt want to go back to that. Coolidge maybe.The level of control politically and culturally held by our idiot masters is still astounding. I went to a Barnes and Noble the other day (still there) and Obama‚Äôs book was prominent everywhere. I mean all over, laying flat one after another taking up three frickin tables, not stacked. It was as if nothing else had been written in years. Somewhere buried to the side was a small book titled to the effect, Stupid shit Trumps says.All said, this will not last. These people know the regime‚Äôs days are numbered. Doesn‚Äôt mean something good and righteous is replacing them but I welcome anything now.

            I went to a Barnes and Noble the other day (still there) and Obama‚Äôs book was prominent everywhere. I mean all over, laying flat one after another taking up three frickin tables, not stacked. It was as if nothing else had been written in years. Somewhere buried to the side was a small book titled to the effect, Stupid shit Trumps says.It is a great shame that all large book stores now shove woke garbage in one‚Äôs face, regardless of where one may be. When I visited Boston a couple of years back, I went into the Barnes and Noble in a large shopping center (Prudential Building?)‚Ä¶ I was stunned again by the woke-ness.Here on the Isles, if you observe carefully whilst you are in the queue at a Waterstones, you will find yourself assaulted by books with immensely sanctimonious titles by the likes of Eco-Cunt Greta Thunberg, token joggers and of course feminists. And that‚Äôs another thing whilst I have been triggered to ranting mode: the sanctimonious titles of today. It really speaks to the smug self-satisfaction of these people. In fact, it is one more reasonnotto take them seriously.If the titles are bad, we can only imagine what the contents are like. On the plus side, I am reading Hugh Trevor-Roper‚ÄôsThe Last Days of Hitlercurrently, and find it to be both very readable and full of solid reasoning. He writes without self-congratulation, and with very little over the top judgement to tell a fascinating story of The Most Influential Man of Our Time‚Äôs last days, as well as his own investigation into what happened to him in the aftermath. A good piece of popular scholarship.

                I just saw yesterday that the number one bestseller on Amazon is George Orwell‚Äôs ‚Äú1984.‚Äù When was that written, in the 1940‚Äôs?  Another question I have, is it being read by concerned citizens as a warning, or by our enemies as an instruction manual?

                    Heh. Orwell‚Äôs book remains the most terrifying thing that I have ever read. I found it more terrifying than any of Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs works.
I would wager that most people are purchasing it because both ‚Äòleft‚Äô and ‚Äòright‚Äô claim that our world is heading toward just such a totalitarian position. That is one thing they can agree on, I suppose. So I am going with ‚Äòconcerned citizens‚Äô on this one.

                    Orwell (Eric Blair was his real name) was originally going to title it ‚ÄòThe Last Man in Europe‚Äô. He got the main idea from the Tehran conference where the world would be divided up into spheres of influence. I think his view of the govt statements/newspapers was taken from his experience in the UK in the run up to and during WW2. He mentions it a lot in his diaries.It was originally going to be called 1980 but was delayed for a few years as he had TB, so it changed to 1982 then 1984. He died soon after publication.

                    Well,The Last Days of Hitleris rather short, and very considered. There is no emotional wailing about the evils of the man. Just well reasoned judgement on one subject only: his last days and the author‚Äôs investigation of his whereabouts immediately after the fall of Berlin.Perhaps the most stunning thing about the book (who‚Äôs first edition was published in 1946) is the introduction to the 3rd edition, which was published in 1956. In this introduction the author details how many questions he had had about the Russian‚Äôs knowledge of Hitler‚Äôs demise were answered by a wave of German prisoners released in 1955, from the USSR. The shenanigans the Russians got up to make for interesting reading indeed.In addition, in this very same introduction the author details his investigation, as well as some of the dead ends he trod, in order to reason about Trump‚Äôs fate. To see his hard gained conclusion vindicated by the latter events of 1956 is very satisfying. But even then, no smugness. No boastfulness. Just a man doing the job he was assigned with the utmost rigour.I do not think my waffling has spoiled the book for you, if you choose to read it!

                        My. Understanding of the Hman and the nazi‚Äôs didn‚Äôt really become the villains we know today until almost the 80s. Although, I remember hearing a song from the 30s or 40s called ‚Äúthe man with the little mustache has got to go‚Äù.
thanks for the suggestion!

                            that isn‚Äôt quite accurate.  the holocaust wasn‚Äôt much mentioned in the media; see The Producers, for example.  made in 1967, by a jewish writer/director, about a play named ‚ÄúSpringtime For Hitler‚Äù played for laughs.
nazis in the movies were shown in the context of the war, so they didn‚Äôt have to be made into ‚Äúvillians‚Äù as they were portrayed as ‚Äúenemies‚Äù.   the left was more likely then to call someone a fascist, than a nazi.
i would say the 80‚Äôs were around the time when nazis were portrayed post-war, and made into plain evil doers.

                    Perhaps, but I can‚Äôt foresee who would go to war with them.  Most of the US leadership is bribed to look the other way.  It‚Äôs pretty amazing what a cheap date our politicians have been.  Trillions in gains for the CCP for a few million to the families of the DC kleptocracy.  I also can‚Äôt see Europe having any will to fight them.  As long as they play it smart, they can pretty much run the board.

                        China‚Äôs history of internecine strife is longer and bloodier than that of the English speaking people.  Just last year, as the Wuhan lockdown was ending, there was a conflict on a bridge that connects Hubei (Wuhan) and Jiangxi provinces, with the Jiangxi police teaming up with regular citizens to lay a beating on Hubei residents who tried to cross the bridge.  There are linguistic differences throughout China that help fuel regionalism. too.  I know that predicting the economic collapse of China is old hat, but someday the downturn will come and it remains to be seen if the residents hinterlands will take their pound of flesh from Party apparatchiks.

                            I‚Äôve puzzled over China‚Äôs long history of civil wars, since they had no J**s to blame it on.
Ethnic and urban divisions, of course!Thank you for solving this mystery.
The Mandarin eunuchs took only 3 generations to reduce China to rubble.  Academia does have its downside.

                I always thought that too, but a lot of Chinese have dunk the multi-culti jungle juice (recall how many of their mid-tier elites went to American universities).  While I was there for a brief stay I saw where the Han coasties imported labor from the non-Han hinterlands.  Not a lot to be sure, but it‚Äôs a brief walk from that to importing a bunch of Afghans, etc under the guise that they‚Äôve always been a Chinese province of sorts.

                    They are forcibly sterilizing and brainwashing their Uighers and bragging about it on Twitter. Jack Ma has been missing for months.  Any government that can do that is under no pressure to go woke anytime soon.  The CCP can import as much labor as they want without having any pressure to make them citizens.  Even if they did, their citizens votes count for even less than ours.

            The Children‚Äôs section is somehow even worse. It‚Äôs mostly gay shit, girl power, and anti-racism. The ones directed at boys have some cucked titles like ‚ÄúA Good Boy doesn‚Äôt need to slay Dragons‚Äù.One of my favorite childhood memories was going to the book store, and they took that away from us.

                When my wife and I went into a Barnes and Noble looking for kids books a couple of years ago that was stunning.  They still had some good choices, but you had to go looking for them.  Everything on display was woke propaganda.  Based on how the shelves looked it doesn‚Äôt sell well either.

                    Go to antique malls and yard sales (I realize the latter may be few in the age of the Fauxdemic).  Buy old Golden Books or anything published before 1965.  Buy old books at ThriftBooks.com, or anywhere else you can find them.  Boycott modern, woke publishers and their propaganda.

                        That is mostly what we have done. We noticed as we have built our collection that the change to making sure children‚Äôs books had diversity in them started the late 60s to early 70s. Of course the problem with older copies is that most them are deteriorating, especially if you regularly read them to your kids. Updated editions of Little Golden Books will be edited to include diverse characters.

        Surely you have noticed by now DC looks like a war zone.  That‚Äôs because it is.
Mr. Chao is owned by his in-laws who are owned by the CCP.  Mitch McConnell‚Äôs Overton bubble and it‚Äôs invertebrate crew are on the wrong side of history, and have as much to lose as the other communists if a document dump occurs.
This problem will solve itself in ways the GOP establishment never dreamed of.

            Zman is right: forget the marches around the Capitol building. Waste of time.
Much more effective would be 100,000+ people marchingpeacefully and patrioticallythrough the swank neighborhoods on public streets where the cloud people gather together in the DC area.
Seriously. Not one single word need be spoken, not one fist raised. I think that would be spooky effective.

                The old me would agree with you ‚Äì perhaps a decade or more ago.  Now, I cannot.  Nothing peaceful will achieve anything.  Not advocating any specific action by any one person, just stating that no government change or populist revolution ever occurred peacefully.  No voting, no silent marching, no signs, will changeanything.  They hate you and they want you dead and your children raped and they think it‚Äôs funny.  Keep that in your mind at all times.

            how to de-google. A few alternatives. There may be a real long term movement here.https://ghostbin.co/paste/hwzn6https://ghostbin.co/paste/6r6x4
I‚Äôve been asking people to do a google images search on‚ÄúHappy Black Women‚Äùthen‚ÄúHappy White Women‚ÄùNo-one has said they did it and it was fine. The usual expression was shock.A couple of obvious liar cat women ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt have time for that nonsense‚Äù.  To the obvious question ‚ÄúHow do you know it‚Äôs nonsense‚Äù? they scuttle off.

        Here‚Äôs a great quote from Williamson in his ‚ÄúEnd of the GOP‚Äù column of Jan. 12, which sums up his and NR‚Äôs attitude: ‚ÄúI have met the¬†people, I know them well. And if this country has any future, it is with the¬†Establishment. The¬†People¬†are insane.

            Another advantage of having the panty-twisted overlords going full retard and waking up the proles is that once one recognizes the hate it becomes easier to see it. And it is everywhere. One needn‚Äôt dissect  these wannabe ivory tower pieces, on the ‚Äúright‚Äù or down the official NYT/NPR pipe alike, to find straight statements of hate.They still torture english and turn the truth into an inside-out pig, but they tell you quite plainly that they hate you. They can‚Äôt help it. Their own anxiety and insecurity over their tenuous status and economic position predicated on peddling lies bleeds out in plain view. Their greatest fear, falling back into the unwashed badwhite camps, has them raging.Like tech censorship, this has been going on with small turns for a long time. But now that they have gone to 11, even of they dial it back a great many of us have an ear for their tune that cannot be undone.

            The GOPe has long been overrun with Fake Conservatism , Conservatism is an attitudes type  like this guy.You know the sort  ‚Äúsure he does unspeakable things to  children and robs his country blind  but what lovely bow tie and suit , such a conservative at heart.‚ÄùThe reality is Actual Conservatism is policy, minimal foreign intervention, economic nationalism and social conservatism. The exact views run out of the party years ago. This is why almost no one under like 70 and who isn‚Äôt a Country Clubber pays any mind to these dorks and they exist by grifting and by patronage which makes them at best tools and that‚Äôs me being nice.

        Piggy Williamson just can‚Äôt accept he is a prole.  He was born a prole, and a prole he shall die as.  It‚Äôs in his DNA.Here‚Äôs something the younger people here may not be aware of; in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs there were lots and lots of political assassinations, and not just the two biggies.  And it was mostly dems killing other dems.   Keep in mind the jacobins ended up getting the chop, by way of a historical precedent.China may be in for a suprise too, once they become the dems official scapegoat for the mess they are both making of things.Final word of advice: inflation is coming, lots and lots of inflation.  Buy a house now, and be sure to get a fixed rate loan.  You will have that baby paid off in 5 years!   Also grow some food, even on a patio or balcony.  And get a job that doesn‚Äôt take a ton of gas to get too.

            The financial advice is solid. Let me add buy any expensive hard goods such as appliances and vehicles in the next year. Even a depreciating asset like a car will be a better investment than stocks and bonds.
As for Williamson, like most people from humble backgrounds he pays undeserved respect to the elites because he has an idealized version of them. He should have realized at this point what unimpressive scum most of these types are, but he hasn‚Äôt or, to be charitable, fakes like he hasn‚Äôt.

            My ex-wife suffers from the same unrealized dream of class elevation. She‚Äôs hopelessly prole but because she went to an Ivy League school, she could see all the upper class people she so desperately wanted to join. And she would ape their manners, and go to their parties, and out-perform them in school ‚Ä¶ and prole she remains. It was embarrassing really, bc no matter how much she mimicked them, she never fit in. So she‚Äôd dump on her own kind, thinking it would elevate her status. It never worked, though she still runs around with her nose in the air (and her arm in a KFC bucket).

Parties in and out of government are looking for excuses to suppress and destroy voices that oppose the left.Because AT lacks the ability to monitor comments in real time, and because our position that comments are a forum, not something that we publish, is being called into question, we can no longer publish comments.We take this action with a heavy heart

                You may want to give a free trial of Investors Business Daily, Financial Times, or Seeking Alpha. These are Financial periodicals but they have moderated comments sections. I‚Äôve stated before that sometimes the comments are more interesting than the articles, ft.com in particular has a lot of political commentary articles and it‚Äôs fun to read both of UK and the US opinions and also offer your own comments.

            Not really. The reality of twenty years of continual warfare is that the Special Forces Olympics + Big Data is very, very good at killing select groups of people. Of course, the innumerate in charge figure 73 million plus is easy, but certainly Biden/Harris will have at their disposal about 30,000 very highly trained people able to remove forever about a million Deplorables without much effort. That‚Äôs reality: Predator Drones and Hellfire missiles used against jihadi wedding parties will be used against MAGA wedding parties.However, the Abwehr leading up to WWII was very clever in destroying much of the Soviet Military leadership ‚Äî they found out who was talented and leaked info to Stalin‚Äôs NKVD that said officer was plotting against Stalin. That and the use of accusations as career enhancement helped make the Soviet Officer Corps in 1941 mostly a joke. Everyone with talent was executed by Stalin.There is a lesson here. There is more fun to be had for denouncing a talented mid-tier leader as secret MAGA than just about anything else. And those best to denounce are data analysts. Those guys are hard to replace.Open confrontation is over. Its attrition warfare from here on out. Boycotts, denunciations, pushing BLM/Green upon organizations that must be destroyed: Disney, Google, Apple, etc.Be like Water.

        If I were to say ‚Äúwhat has happened‚Äù it would be that my whole life I was taught/told to be friendly, and include other people who were ‚Äúdisadvantaged‚Äù, and to be open minded, etc etc and then the second ‚Äúwe‚Äù became a loathed minority of electorate, i.e. the moment the tables turned, the cultural ethos is so hostile and hate filled from the left that democracy itself is no longer tenable.  They finally get a heaping helping of the pie and then they snatch all the pie away from everyone.  And the Conservative Inc/New Republic/Republicans are somehow deluding themselves that in the context of that, as ‚Äúwe‚Äù become an ever smaller minority of the electorate, that they are going to convince some of the middle of the road leftists that they should take the deal we got and play fair and share and vote for lower taxes etc.  The demographically correct leftists would be absolutely insane to fall for that now that everyone can see what is happening to us and how our Conservative Inc overlords have done nothing at all to stand up for Constitutional rights.

        I have to laugh they still don‚Äôt get it, and these are supposed to be people nominally on our side. Why if you just get rid of Trump all the reasons people voted for him will go away. These people are almost too stupid to breathe. Reagan could be a rabble rouser with the best of them, and didn‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about what the left thought. The left hated Reagan. When your opponent hates your standard bearer you‚Äôve probably made the right choice.

            What do you see as Reagan‚Äôs greatest accomplishments?
He seems like an earlier version of Trump in that his main attraction was that he was hated by our enemies. But what did he do?
He ‚Äúwon the cold war‚Äù but he greatly increased the debt, in direct contradiction to his main creed, and began the amnesty avalanche.
I‚Äôm not inclined to hold Reagan in high esteem. I guess he was the best option at the time.

                    For me, was set Reagan apart is his speaking ability from his acting background.
To me, he could sound warm and grandfatherly or stern and Biblical.
Heck, there were even times he was earnest, like when his voice cracked as he recited Martin Treptow‚Äôs pledge during his inaugural address.
I also think Reagan had more talented speechwriters who understood his strengths as a speaker and had a better grasp of history.

                I‚Äôm not defending Reagan, that‚Äôs not really my point. His legacy is whatever anyone personally makes it out to be. There was very little honest deal making between the democrats and Reagan, just about every deal the democrats made they reneged on, the debt was just one of them. Tip O‚ÄôNeill swore up and down he would enact Reagan‚Äôs cuts to other spending to pay for the defense increases. Never happened. Reagan got cornholed and was vilified to boot.The fact that these idiots don‚Äôt know this, or whitewash it, is proof that they shouldn‚Äôt have a damn thing to say about anything. ‚ÄúWe need to be nice to the left when they rape us, so just lie back and think of Reagan.‚Äù

        The far left has a laundry list of hopes and dreams that they believe will be carried forward by Pelosi, Schumer and the Alzheimer‚Äôs patient with his Jamaican whore sidekick.  Most of these hopes and dreams will be dashed, as Obama Term 3 unfolds.  I generally interact with more left wingers than right wing people as I live in a Communist backwater (with great weather).  There‚Äôs frustration building, let me tell you.  It‚Äôs probably why they put Bernie on the Senate budget committee chair.  As they screw them they can point to Bernie and say ‚Äúwell, he is your guy here‚Ä¶What?  You don‚Äôt like him now?‚Äù  Bernie will then give them a wink in the Senate cloak room before heading out to buy another vacation house.  One thing about the left, they don‚Äôt have the patience and discipline to be Fuk-ed by the uni-party for decades like Republicans with nothing to show for it.

            The Left/Democrat Socialists will be crushed like bugs. AOC and the Squad will sell out just as quickly as Sanders did, and the grassroots will freak out but be absolutely powerless.
The Corporatist/Fascists now control the country, and will do so until it implodes. All I am watching for is when money stops being printed and markets are allowed to fully tank.

        OT: I just had a look at VoxDay‚Äôs blog. He is still a plan truster! Do these people ever learn???This is what he wrote just yesterday:If you can‚Äôt trust the plan, trust the President. If you can‚Äôt trust the President because you‚Äôre feeling too anxious about events and the relentless demoralization campaign that is being performed for your benefit, remember, all the tea leaves in the world will determine absolutely nothing.So relax. There is no reason, none whatsoever, to believe things aren‚Äôt proceeding precisely as they are supposed to proceed. The double envelopment is taking place. The enemy legions are trapped and helpless. I won‚Äôt even think about worrying until 48 hours AFTER someone else is sworn in as POTUS. I am, quite frankly, more than a little excited to watch it all unfold. This is the sort of history about which we have only hitherto been able to read.ANDI‚Äôve never been more convinced that The Storm is approaching.

                    Not at all.  Just pointing out the irony of Vox Day (the pot) calling Jordan Peterson (the kettle) crazy. Although I‚Äôll concede it‚Äôs not over yet (Jan. 20 isn‚Äôt here yet) so maybe Vox Day will be proven correct.  But I‚Äôm not in that camp.

                    I think he‚Äôs got more than enough going on to keep his fans occupied. He‚Äôs always careful to couch what he says with ‚ÄúI have no inside knowledge. I may be wrong‚Äù especially when you listen to his Darkstreams.Me, I just bought a set of Junior Classics reprinted from the early 20th-century editions before the poz hit, published by Castalia House. That‚Äôs real stuff my kids and grandkids can read, terrific moral and ethical lessons, an investment in their future. See the posts higher up about the state of the Barnes and Noble children‚Äôs section. Vox went to a lot of effort to put out something real and durable that can help train up a new generation. No mainstream publishing house is putting out stuff like that.He‚Äôs got a lot more going on than some probably-mistaken political prognostications.

                Yeah, I find his need to do that extremely off-putting.However, as I‚Äôve said before, the correlation between ‚Äúasshole‚Äù and ‚Äúwrong‚Äù is almost non-existent.If Vox Day was merely a purveyor of meaningless Hopium, and merely an asshole, I‚Äôd have a problem with him.But the guy clearly fights and works his ass off. He‚Äôs doing more to provide actual alternatives to mainstream platforms than almost anyone I can think of.InfogalacticSocialgalacticUnauthorized TVArkhavenCastalia HouseAlso, I like the way he talks to his fans and supporters. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with hope. He targets a lot of young, lost, disenfranchized people and presents Christianity to them in a way that speaks to them.He‚Äôs running media sites, producing content and taking a public stand daily. He‚Äôs not all hat, no cattle. He has skin in the game. While I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs working to make sure that is lucrative for him, there‚Äôs certainly nothing wrong with making money.

                    Good points.  There are certainly a lot of things admirable about Vox Day.  His book SJW‚Äôs Always Lie is great and very useful.  The dialectic vs. rhetoric thing is useful, along with ‚Äúnever apologize,‚Äù and plenty of other things.  That‚Äôs what makes his commitment to the Q plan puzzling. Anyway, we‚Äôll find out soon‚Ä¶

        This is pretty reminiscent of the Mexican revolution when the oligarchs ‚Äúsilenced‚Äù Madero and began oppressing his supporters. After about a decade, the oligarchs were killed or deposed and the necessary reforms started being implemented. The critics of the oligarchs, at the time, were disgusted by Madero. Once Madero was elected, they became irrelevant because ultimately they really just supported the system, but not with a completely clean conscience. I guess the lesson is that you simply can‚Äôt serve two masters, so you might as well commit to one or the other.

        Hi Z,Very interesting article on your behalf but I think the comment regarding lefty to be a bit optimistic, notable exception being Glenn Greenwald notwithstanding. I agree that there is sense of hubristic triumphalism on steroids from the left regarding the latest round of de-platforming and a possible Auto de fe of the Orange Man. They do have they‚Äôre narrative, repulsive though it is and it‚Äôs being rammed into the public consciousnesshttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/07/capitol-hill-trump-rioters-race-powerThe rioting during the summer in the UK and USA has been memory holes.I come from one of the province‚Äôs of the Empire and the collective pearl clutching even amongst family members is shocking. It‚Äôs terrifying as you can forsee them being all in on censorship. I do hope you‚Äôre right and there can be a way out of it but to see people you respected gladly adopting a servile state doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence.

        Scorning the nutjob grifters is one way to fight back. Another is to educate &amp; train the few remaining sane.New Skills &amp; Habits (Cont)Learn to travel sans auto. Spend a day riding the urban bus system, routes, and neighborhoods. Cash only, &amp; correct change helps. Learn to look and smell like the regulars, and rush hour crowds are a plus. Hoodie up, head down. Ditto for the interstate bus lines. A tractor-trailer rig hauling the right flatbed load can be an interesting option after dark. If you‚Äôre fit, a good road bike can do 80 miles/day easy. And a motorcycle w/full-face helmet is the bomb, as the kids like to say today.

            Some friends and I were discussing resistance techniques that one should never, ever use, because of the peace love and understanding that we‚Äôre all required to do now. But back in the 19th century, they used what they called a ‚Äúwork-to-rule‚Äù strike. Just‚Ä¶ follow the rules. ALL the rules. To the letter. And watch the factory collapse. Imagine how quickly one could bring a major city to its knees, for instance, if sufficient numbers of people ‚Äî maybe just a few thousand ‚Äî obeyed ALL the traffic laws to the letter. But don‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs bad, and you are all horrible people.

                    Corrosion, not direct confrontation. The latter gets you dead, whereas the former is insidious and largely impractical to detect or inhibit. After decades of affluence making us incrementally stupider, we owe to posterity to reverse that trend. The stupid will die first on the firing line, but the Jackboots cannot kill that which they cannot find.

                    I learned this a while ago living in my extremely culturally enriched city.  Sure, you might have to work for someone but there is no law at all that requires you to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù at what you do.  You can actually be awful at what you do.  Really stupid in fact.  Like, make all of the worst choices when there is a choice to make etc etc.  Oddly enough, working that way is actually very much in line with how our culturally enriched brethren work on their best days so they hardly ever even complain about it.

I pick one up, pretend to read it, and then replace it facing backwards.  I do this for others, too. but she is so appalling and prevalent, that I really do a number on the b^#$h!

                Ask a beat cop how easy it is to pursue a suspect through a dense crowd. Now add in that the guy fleeing is probably operating on an adrenaline rush and the cop is laden with 15 pounds of auxiliary equipment. But that‚Äôs not the point. You always want to have multiple viable egress means. Predictability is death. Just ask a deer during hunting season.

                Viable escape if but one component of how we can successfully beat a modern high-tech tyranny. Stand your ground is a last resort, and the odds are not good because Jackboots, by doctrine, only come in overwhelming force. Better to be invisible (or at least appear benign) and operate from the shadows.

                    The next step to compliment Tom‚Äôs tool bag suggestion is to introduce yourself to surveillance/counter-surveillance. Start easy and watch The French Connection. Good movie and shows simple techniques like using reflections to check for observers and swimming upstream to force ‚Äútails‚Äù and ‚Äúeyes‚Äù to reveal themselves. If you find it interesting there are plenty of free resources to take the skill further.

        Tone? The GOP has been obsessed with tone policing everyone for generations now.
Did Z say in a pod cast that we had to dress nice and have a tight hair cut, and that we couldn‚Äôt get away the disheveled lefty-look? I‚Äôm not trying to be argumentative, but isn‚Äôt that under the banner of tone?I loved seeing the Confederate batttle flag in the capitol!

            Tiny dick and balls? No ‚Äòman-bits‚Äô?
I remember watching clips of him fromFiring Line, and always found the most repulsive thing about him to be his ‚Äòreptilian facial expressions‚Äô. I cannot really explain further. Of course, in those days I thought he was quite the devoted conservative. Oh well.

        I would add that I‚Äôm trying to figure out how I can get involved with BLM. I figure Magic Johnson would make a far better leader of Apple than Tim Cook. And Kanye West by magic melanin is more equipped to lead Google than Sundar Pinchai. And lets not stop there: I think everyone in the FBI, CIA, Military, etc should be diverse, aka black. Black black black and black.Lets not forget Extinction Rebellion. Now there‚Äôs a degrade the electrical grid and fuel system I can get behind. I think all drones likely to fire hellfire missiles at weddings attended by MAGA should be battery powered, or at least using friendly bio fuel.Japan is facing blackouts as they shut down all their nukes and can‚Äôt get enough LNG to run their heating systems and power generation in a deep freeze. They‚Äôre in panic shut down systems mode now.Street protest is over. That thing in the Capitol was a one time shot. We have weapons. I‚Äôd rather have Kanye and Magic in charge of data teams hunting us, with the teams themselves comprised of friends/family of Pop Smoke and Nipsey Hustle, than what we have now.

            The Federal government, indeed most State governments as well as much of The Dreaded Private Sector, is already probably as ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù as it can be without grinding to a halt.

Dumbing it down by 15-20 IQ points or the equivalent loss of educational attainment (roughly four years of school), needless to say doesn‚Äôt make the lumbering animal any wiser or capable.Sure, there are still competent people, even in the Gov. and military, but they are very much the minority, and they tend to not be minorities üòÄ

1. (regarding KW) The Iranians use guys like this to clear mine fields


2. You‚Äôll note that most of their stories get few comments and that is because many nursing homes no longer provide free internet access to their patients.


I suspect, however, that if Kevin W was Iranian, he would pay one of his beloved Afghani immigrants to run out into the minefield in his place. After all, he would assume that their role in Iran would be to do the work he doesn‚Äôt want to do

        Maybe its just because I‚Äôm reading ‚Äúthe Finish‚Äù by that Blackhawk Down guy, but I see no reason for the Establishment to fear. Indeed, they have the capacity to eliminate 73 Million Trump voters plus 30 million friends and family.So I would advocate ‚Äúhugging the enemy‚Äù as the Soviets did in a good deal of WWII to negate the enemy advantages in tanks and artillery. Its one thing to drone a Wedding filled with MAGA types or shoot 65 Trump voters in Vegas. Its another to hit a Lesbian Vegan Free Trade Farmers Market in Seattle. Ironically those places if we pose as BLM/Anti-Fa are likely the safer places. [No place is safe].Other things ‚Äî communication (don‚Äôt), movement (don‚Äôt), opinions (don‚Äôt). The power of the US military to kill enemies the President does not like is absolute and staggering. So expect the worst from Willie Brown‚Äôs ho and you will not be disappointed.

            I‚Äôd have to imagine that a lot of campaign consultants are worried about ever being employed since they‚Äôre no longer needed.  As well, I‚Äôm not sure how responsive an oligarchical dictatorship is going to be in regards to their left wing desires since they‚Äôve divorced themselves from any democratic feedback.

                Those ballot boxes aren‚Äôt going to stuff themselves.  Besides ‚Äúconsulting fees‚Äù are a way of political payoff, not for providing actual campaign strategy.  Basically they are go-betweens for the donor class and the candidates.

            Yeah, good question.  Someone point out a ‚Äúgood‚Äù Leftie these days.  We remember the old days of Reagan where he‚Äôd pound down a few at the bar with Tip O‚ÄôNeil.  Those were the days of ‚ÄúClassical‚Äù Liberals, but I‚Äôm not sure I see that today.
Certainly, the discipline shown for party line votes would not indicated any good Lefties exist.  Perhaps they‚Äôre nervous as Z-man says, but that probably comes more from being the duplicitous liars that they are‚Äîliving in a fantasy world in order to maintain their position at the public trough.

You know, it might be a good thing women are in charge. They prefer fantasy violence, as opposed to the real thing of when men were in charge.  The tradeoff is that the trains don‚Äôt quite run on time.

                That is interesting now that you mention it.  I said at the time of CHAZ that blmfa would never be able to pull that off where I live and I live in a kinda-liberal area.  To live in one of these True Believer places like Bolder-Denver, Ann Arbor, Portland, etc. is to live under constant threat of a hate-mob showing up and burning down your house and then the police arresting you for air pollution violations.

Psyops playing the part of Antifa and Trump supporters.  Nothing new.  It‚Äôs probably why stand down orders are routine.

            Ashli Babbit never existed? It was a fake shooting? A friend of mine is convinced that Newtown and El Paso were really little movies with actors and such. I find that hard to believe. But, if theres evidence‚Ä¶.

                The limp dicks lost control of the radicals, the slavers got stomped, and a lot of innocent people got hurt, but the matter was settled. Different times, though.
All I know is the radicals are in the driver‚Äôs seat.

                Following widespread, brutal, and bloody repression no doubt. Thankfully hatreds don‚Äôt run that deep here.

Reconstruction being the worst example of political violence. Yet few strongly supported it, and it lasted a decade or so I think. The stuff in Europe is in a different league.

                        This is all the echoes of that. It‚Äôs one reason why I think we‚Äôre at the end of an age. Old stuff isn‚Äôt new.  If there‚Äôs to be another civil war it hasn‚Äôt happened yet, so jumping to Reconstruction is presumptuous. In fact, I think it‚Äôs meant to demoralize, intimidate, stall off a reaction.At any rate, I don‚Äôt think things will end up the way they look like they will right now. We‚Äôve been heading this way longer than any of us have been alive. What strikes me about this moment is how out of control it feels. Much different than, say, 9/11, and that makes me think we won‚Äôt get more of the same at the end of it. But who knows.

        Ronald Reagan won California 2 times as Governor in the 1967 and 1971. No way he‚Äôd win even 40 percent of the vote running in California now.  National Review was a big part of the 1986 amnesty, and Bush failed amnesty attempt in 2005.  They wonder why their party lost the country while not looking in the mirror at all the endless Immigration they approved.  America needs to break apart and hopefully some plans for the next 20 years are in the woodwork for that.
