        After skimming thru that piece from Salon complaining about violent language from the right, the next presentation was a slide show of various horror flicks featuring Donald Trump as the  villain. No sense of irony, never mind common decency.

        The mass exodus from Moslem lands is not from a collapse of Islam, but of the dictators/third world despots that kept Islam contained. In fact, Islam is expanding and is conquering new territory. They are moving into Europe, like locusts, and will consume everything in their paths. If Europe decides it doesn’t have the will to do what must be done to save their civilization, then they become Eurabia in one more generation, and a Moslem continent in two.

        Islamophobia?Am I to be deemed irrational in my “fear and/or hatred”, if their instruction manual encourages the murder, extortion,  and enslavement of me?I’d discuss it further, but apparently lying/false “witness” , in disingenuous defense in justification of “The Religion of Peace” is to be expected  as well.Well, so I’ve read, from a translation of their instruction manual.

        The jihad will end only when rank-and-file Muslims fear non-Muslims more than they fear ISIS and other sickbag killers among their own pseudo-religion.

        I have come to believe that many people have ceased to live real lives, out there in the world, where things are as they are, where physics and mathematics operate, and where you go and what you do have real repercussions for you, and for the environment around you.Instead they live on their computers, Facebook and Twitter, and simply click away from the things they dislike or that disturb them.  Not only do they click away, but they complain about some meaningless aspect of them, and collect sympathetic comments from others, thereby building some sort of hive-minded on-line short term community.  Then, tomorrow, start again on something else, and do it all over.They are going to be shocked when the real world intrudes on its terms, not their terms, as the rest of us know it will one day.

        What Prog moonbats like Chauncey DeVega don’t get is that those guys with the Kalashnikovs would have shot a ghetto nerd like him and never given his fancy “philosophizing” a moment’s thought.

        It’s events exactly like this which are most threatening to he alliance of the Muslim-Progressive takeover of Europe. It works best when it works quietly. If there were one Muslim entity of nutters, this would not happen, but there are many, and they hate each other even more than they hate the West. That was what formed the falsely discredited foreign policies of old that actually worked. Little did we know how realistic they were until we cut them loose.

        Even in death, right in the face of the next terror outrage (and to be an outrage, these attacks can only get bigger and bigger) the simpering moonbats will go down thinking they “understand” people. They may plead on their knees for their pathetic lives on the basis they so very willingly helped their muslim ‘friends’ to do all this, but they will discover that surrendering brings a far smaller reward than they had imagined.Merely thinking nice things about the barbarians doesn’t stop a speeding bullet or the blast from a bomb where they least expected it.However, just as Islam is far from spirituality as it is possible to get, the left is as far from understanding humans as it possible to be. All of mankind’s history, the people’s temperaments, their proclivities across the ages has made no impact on the progressive ‘mind.’. It is almost that they can say the word ‘history’ but have no concept of its meaning or what has happened in the past.Dreaming and wishing and self-congratulation won’t count for much in the coming war, though perhaps I am being silly: we have been at war with these muslim slugs for a very long time even if our elite and their enablers refuse to admit it.

        If common sense existed, every mosque in every Western town and city would be turned inside out today, and all weapons found redistributed to the local populations. Weapons would be found, I’m sure.It’s not as if they need them for self protection. They’re more protected than the Delta Smelt and the polar bear.

        A few more of these and the rightist authoritarians might start getting elected in West Europe (already happening in the former Warsaw Pact countries).  The question in my mind is whether or not it will happen in time.

        Speaking of moonbats, who can forget this square jawed imbecile who was actually Chief of Staff of the US Army:General George Casey discusses ‘workplace violence’ after the Fort Hood shootings by Major Nidal Hassan – No conclusion jumping for him.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8EITu5ZYo8“Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Casey emphasized the need to wait for the completion of the investigation before drawing conclusions concerning the cause or motivation behind the shootings:“We have to be careful,” Casey said, “because we can’t jump to conclusions now based on little snippets of information that have come out.”“As great a tragedy as this was, it would be a shame if our diversity became a casualty as well,” the Army Chief of Staff also said Sunday.”“Gen. George Casey said he was ‘concerned’ that the incident could result in a potential backlash against Muslim soldiers.”http://armylive.dodlive.mil/index.php/2009/11/gen-casey-on-the-strength-of-our-diversity/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/11/08/casey-im-concerned-about-possible-backlash-against-muslim-soldiers/Given the current C in C, I doubt there has been any improvement over Casey.
