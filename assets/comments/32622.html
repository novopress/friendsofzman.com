        The loser is the White guy who strives to be colorblind (“good boy–here’s a treat and a pat on the head”) and accepts the Third World immigrants (as long as they come legally), which keeps him from being called a racist (bad!!).

            Hmm, stapling a green card to every “legally” imported shitskin’s US degree – winner or loser?

                Depends how one sees such?  As to racial purity, probably not—albeit, if it draws Northern Europeans into American universities specifically for the aspect of immigration (now closed to them), perhaps.  However, the program will probably *not* be restricted to STEM degrees and most likely attract 3rd world applicants in faux areas of study.  As we don’t need more “dirt scrapers”, we don’t need more “Women’s Studies” majors.  Universities are poz’d, they will do whatever it is they can to destroy any positive effect of the program.

                    Why are you dissembling on this? We all know what stapling green cards to diplomas means. It doesn’t mean highly motivated Swedes trying to leave the suffocating welfare state they live in. It doesn’t even mean more feminist blue hairs getting Women’s Studies degrees. What it means is endless pajeets with sham IT degrees crowding into your town, 20 to a building, raising your rents and pooping on the local riverbed. Just look at what has happened to Canada. They’re starting to talk about this openly, until the thought police step in.

                        My interpretation from the Trump speech, not the excerpt or news quip, was that it was for “US” university graduates.  We have for years milked full tuition from certain foreign country groups, such as Chinese and particularly Indians.  These students were common and sought after because US citizens often were not inclined to put in the work for such advanced degrees.My former department could literally be split between Indian and Chinese grad students.  These folk *often* delayed graduation so that they did not have to leave the US.  So much a problem was this that the last dept head had to issue “timelines” for degree completion of these students.  We had students spending 8 years in the PhD program!The very lucky ones were able to secure H2b VISA’s for employment in US companies, but that was not overly common.  I am not aware that the Trump proposal was for importing foreign trained graduates simply because they had a foreign degree.  That of course presents its own problems on top of what I outlined.

                                I’m not completely up on these mechanisms.  We actually had people to handle that for our students *and* our faculty.  Yep, at one time we had 50% foreign born faculty.

                            No, it is just US university graduates, although he said associates degrees count. I see a lot of the common lefty open border pro-immigration propaganda in your post. Universities have been handing out advanced degrees to American students for decades, so why are they not good enough anymore? Why do we even need universities in the USA if they are just training a bunch of foreigners to work for less money than natives and spy on behalf of their homeland? How does this country benefit from nonstop inflows of Chinese and Indian people, outside of lines going up? Are we entitled to live around people who share our norms and values, or does this not matter because a Chinese guy worked really hard at Berkeley? How does this make our country better, our towns better, our social cohesion better? Again, look at Canada which has basically opened the door to basically unlimited Indian immigration. There are reddits that talk about it, if they haven’t been shut down.

                                I call it like it is.  First, I repeatedly say that US universities “milk” tuition from students—especially foreign students.  This observation is anything, but pro foreign student—rather it is anti-avaricious university, who are whores for money.Second, I was around before such and saw US students “dry up” or rather shrink in the hard sciences over time.  They were logically “replaced” by foreign students who majored predominantly in STEM fields.  Two different mind sets here—Americans continued to expand in general enrollment, but drifted to other, easier majors, foreign students, the opposite.Admittedly I have a bit of biased perspective as our department was postgraduate, not undergraduate.  It was only later we began to award undergraduate degrees.  When your application pool begins to be increasingly foreign, then your student body becomes more foreign.  It is never that we prefer citizens to foreigners, but that the pool of applicants has turned foreign.To my knowledge, there are no general restrictions on foreign citizens applying for education VISA’s in the US and none instituted by education institutions—even to the extent of employing them on department assistantships.I do not take the side of Trump necessarily wrt granting automatic residency upon a degree earned from a US institution.  However, it seems a bit better than we have now with our approximate 1M legal admissions.  (I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT ILLEGALS.)Do you know we have in that legal admissions group a “lottery” subsystem?  Yep, anybody from anywhere can apply and 55k per year are admitted *at random*!  I can assure you that the number of graduate PhD’s in STEM fields is less than 55k, and at least we know who they are, that they speak the language, are educated in a non-bullshit field of study, and acclimatized to US custom and law.The system is indeed broken when we give preference to some unknown, uneducated, unvetted, “street sh*ter” to someone we’ve trained at the highest level our university system can produce.

Of course not. This crowd is pushing their kids to be plumbers and welders, servants to the pajeets.

                                Several years ago a neighbor of mine asked me to talk to his kid about becoming a doctor.When I told him that unless he had a photographic memory he would have to do what I did 40 years ago and devote every waking moment into studying to get the grades needed..He said “That’s what the Chinese kids do. That’s too hard”Another one asked me if there was “an easy way to get into Medical School”.This was before Social media destroyed the White Suburban mind.Every newly minted physician our organization hires is not White.

                    Do the Unis even have the capacity to train STEM in any quantity? Genuinely curious if it’s even possible to ramp up in less than a generation, or if there is so much malinvestment into the crap degrees and departments that it would take longer than that to strip out all the dead weight.

                        I doubt there would be many more STEM graduates. Instead, the preferred dieverse will simply replace white students in those fields.

                        Not a great problem I suspect.  We had such fluctuations even without emphasis due to economy.  All depends upon what numbers you speak about. Doubling?  50%?
Our problem is *not* so much facilities, it’s that Americans are/became ”fat, dumb, and lazy” and drawn to easier courses of study, hence the foreign student influx we encountered during my career—there was a dearth of American applications.  Across the quad, the Business College was swamped with application from budding “symbol manipulators” who all wanted to get their Business Degree “entry ticket”.  The College responded by having a tuition surcharge to enroll.  😉

The math, physics, chemistry, and comp sci teaching in high schools is often so poor that students are woefully ill-prepared (and often ill-motivated) to go into STEM at uni.
The STEM teaching staff at unversities becomes steadily older — usually professors in their sixties — augmented by a precariat adjunct staff who are lucky if they can eat regularly and put a roof over their heads. In other words I’m not sure there will be a STEM teaching staff a generation down the road.

                                Probably fair response. I know when I’m going through resumes, I run through the homeschooled first. I’d do it for ideological reasons anyway, but my experience is even kids who went to the “best” high schools have an inferior grounding.
My kids saw the same thing at college. Kids who screwed around either flunked out or had been homeschooled, too,  and thus bored to tears.

                                This is absolutely correct.  Thanks Ali for keeping me “honest”.  I was blessed with a HS education—public—at the highest level.  Too stupid to realize it at the time, but that’s another story.  Indeed, my HS senior math textbook was the very same one I was required to purchase freshman year at uni.  It started at basic calculus.It was on my watch that such standards were allowed to decline—and now, to “add insult to injury” I put down those students whom, in a sense, have been wronged.  Yep, it is hard for students coming through the system to get the basics that will allow them to excel in STEM coursework.  It all starts (and in a bad sense finishes) in K-12.I was also blessed with the faculty you mention.  I sat in classrooms where the prof’s wore suit and tie and smoked in front of the class—talking “old school” here.  I had stat faculty that made me do all the calculations via pencil, paper, and hand calculator—never computer stat programs like SPSS or BMDP—computers were an aid to, not a replacement for calculation.I did three hour factor analysis problems with graph paper and a protractor.  Only then was I allowed to replicate my solutions via computer and turn them in.  The feeling for what the numbers meant was really hammered home, no black box solution allowed.Sorry for the rant….

                            That gibes with what I’ve seen in examining theses and dissertations at a certain university diachronically. By the second half of the 80s it appears over half of all advanced degree recipients in the STEMs were Moslems, Indians and Chinese. I thought the diversity imperative most likely responsible for this, but I can see the increasing sloth and stupidity of whites as a major factor, too.

                                It’s not just sloth, stupidity, and being ill-prepared. The jobs are not there in USA’s increasingly third-world service sector economy. The last I heard, 55% of new engineering Ph.D.s had neither a job nor a post-doc to go to. Now it takes four years to earn an engineering degree and a further six to earn a Ph.D. — ten years of hard slog to end up unemployed?

                                    That’s true of many fields even outside of STEM. Law, for instance, is no longer a sure path to immediate riches. Unemployment is a distinct possibility, and many positions in the legal profession don’t pay anywhere close to what most people expect.

                                We also got a lot of foreign, but government sponsored, students whose tuition was paid for or subsidized by their home governments.  Of course, these governments had not time nor money for frivolous courses of study.  Hence STEM.  Their students were expected to learn and come home to better *their* country!.

                            Compsci, given your perch in academia, would you recommend an 18 year old white kid go into STEM?  Let’s say that he’s smart, but not a genius.  He can program python and solve calculus problems.
This path certainly served me well, but from the anti-white-male-ness I’ve seen in the last 10 years in industry, I’d hesitate to recommend it now.  On the other hand, I’m not sure what else to recommend to such a kid.

                                A formal degree in CS at the undergrad level is still good.  Programming is not really taught as much as you’d think in CS, but that varies with the dept.There are different “flavors” at the university.  For example, we had Management Information Systems (MIS—Business applications) and Computer Engineering (CE—chip design and such).I remember my second year and they simply dropped a half dozen books on languages down and said, “read these”.  You learned programming in various languages on your own after the first.What you get—that you don’t in home learning—is the *science*.  Algorithms, searching, database organization, etc.  That has value in a high level sense as it crosses language implementation.  There really is such a thing as a “Software Engineer”.  It is/was possible in our program to take *more* math than CS courses.  Math ability at a high level is always a good thing—but remember where I’m coming from as compared to MIS, and Computer and Electrical Engineering.  We all specialized in our respective niche.On the other hand, there are those folk who are affectionados and hackers in the main.  There is good work in the support industry for them as well, but you are better off always with credentials—even if not a college degree. Community colleges are a good, cheap starting point.Microsoft has long had a certification program where you study and then pay for testing on the specific coursework.  There is certification in various programming, database management, networking, Linux OS and such.The cost for testing and certification is a few hundred dollars a course.  You build a resume of “course work”–and all obtained is pertinent to your specific goal of a computer career.  Universities will often offer a major/minor of as little as 32 units out of a 124 unit four year stay.  That’s a lot of noise to signal.

                        I was an undergrad in a STEM program at a state flagship and B1G conference school in the late 90s.
Even back then there was some ridiculous grade inflation via curving. There were also plenty of unqualified women and minorities present.
At that time they had begun injecting the mind virus into STEM students through a few vectors. One was the required Humanities/Liberal Arts electives. Another were, “live in learning,” programs presented as easy credits/quasi-requirements for living in some of the dormitories.

                            I have a distant cousin who married a Ukrainian mail order bride many years ago. By all appearances it worked out very well. She became a university prof here. But the kicker was a few years later she brought her mom over to live with them.

            My takeaway from this somewhat schizophrenic post is that Odysseus-the-Liar from yesterday is a winner and Taylor and Derbyshire are losers.
But I don’t want to live in a society that rewards lying and loopholers, and I see the supposed eminences of this thing as being nothing more than smug nonfactors.

                The problem is framed in today’s relativistic worldview. Obey the rules or disobey the rules? Of course, you have to obey the rules if they are fair and try to subvert them when they are unfair. The leftists know that, but their only problem is moral inversion: they think good things are unfair, they think bad things are fair. They have a rule of morals opposite to the moral law.As a group, conservatives have no external rule of morals other than to follow the rules. They think following the rules is good, not following the rules is bad. So the leftist invent rules for the conservatives to follow.I think the typical conservative is mostly nihilistic and individualistic (except the religious right). He only wants comfort and things staying the same. “Stay out of my garden!”. He thinks the rules will protect his little world of comfort. This is why he insists on the rules being followed. He does not want to fight for anything. He wants others to preserve his comfort for him.In addition to relative wealth, two psychological influences bend conservatives to be doormats. First, the Mommy influence. In the American culture, the Mom figure is hypertrophied (Jung already noticed that). Every conservative wants to know he is a good boy. You follow the rules! Good boy. Mommy would be proud.The other thing is Civics class, also know as brainwashing for conservatives. As somebody who is not American, I fail to understand the reverence American conservative have for the Founding Fathers, who were a bunch of scoundrels and extreme leftist for their age. They are presented as a paragon of virtue and wisdom. I once said that they were bad people in a conservative blog and I received all kinds of emotional and irate reaction, as if I had blasphemed Jesus.The problem is simply that America is founded on a revolution and conservatives are the ones that prefer past states of the revolution to present states of the revolution. A true conservative would vindicate the English colonies, which were Christian, instead of the American revolution, which is progressive and masonic. But this cannot be possible in America, because it would imply to reject our independence as a country. So, unlike other countries (see France), independence and revolution are tied in America. So you have to accept revolution if you are a patriot and conservatives do that. Once you have accepted revolution, leftist are more coherent, because they only take revolution to its unavoidable consequences. Conservatives want to stop the train of revolution while conserving revolution and they always fail.

If conservatives are going to be like grazing herd animals at least they should be like the African Cape Buffalo who is onery as hell and, working together, has the ability to give a beat down to a pride of lions.

                        Yes, the conservative is too lazy. Deep down, he knows life is a fight, but he does not want to fight. So he loses all battles because he never appears in the battlefield. He is busy enjoying life.Then, when the leftist has built the prison where the conservative is going to live, the conservative sees that his life and hobbies are affected and are not that enjoyable anymore.Then, he complains but does nothing. He wants somebody to fight for him. He looks for a savior. Trump will save us so we don’t have to leave the couch! Let somebody do something!

                Do you want to live in this society? Most societies for most of time were either awful due to their rulers or in a struggle to survive – or both. People suck, and yet many hope that the society that springs from people will be better than the individual (“Man never is/ But always to be Blest”). Most people are pleasant enough, but beyond pleasantry lies the truth of selfishness and immorality and aggression and survival.

        Brutal but true…The Northern moralizers who condemned slavery (a distinct minority) didn’t seem to have any problem with 8 year olds being worked to death in the Northern plutocrats’ mills, which could not (and did not) happen to slaves….The South thought that after Bull Run the North would simply concede, because those were the rules…after Sheridan and Sherman’s rampage against civilians and a million dead, they found out that there were no rules…

            My response to blacks whining about “racism” and poverty and blaming it on Whitey was simple. My Irish ancestors dug most of the drainage canals and other public works projects in New Orleans because unlike slaves, they cost nothing to replace and scores of them were coming in by the boat load. When I would tell the black criticizing whitey that, their heads would explode when I’d tell them how the slaves were worth more than the Irish, who were disposable.

                        This is correct.  Indentured proved to be of limited value compared to chattel slavery.  Blacks proved more valuable in that respect.  For one, they were acclimatized and more resistant to disease such as malaria. For another, they were less susceptible to running away and blending in with the populous.

                    My nominal paternal grandmother, a Scot from a famous family, was indentured to an aristocratic british family at age eight. Her mother had died of a fever not long after my grandmother’s birth. Her father, a dragoon officer, was machine-gunned to death in a charge. When my grandmother came of age, the eldest brother was building a printing house in London for himself. Forgot all about her but cashed the payments. The british boys in the house came of age too and raped my grandmother. Grams stole train and lodging fare and went to London. Under penalty of shame, the dear brother coughed up enough funds my grandmother could emigrate to Canada. Later, she visited Detroit and fell in love with my nominal grandfathet, eventually marrying him, he was a 48 yo executive and she young, subsequently American and four boys, all achievers. The nominal grandparents were pillars in their West Michigan community.Slavery is not a black thang. What you do with your life after release says much about you and your family.

                    “but a bunch of Italians were lynched down there.”
One of the biggest lynchings in US history I think. Italians weren’t accepted as whites in those days.

                            Exactly. 99% of every black person lynched in the South did something very bad. And every lynching was covered by the press, so this is no secret.

                            Even so, how you were classified determined what price you paid for your crime or what penalty someone who had committed a crime against you paid.. If memory serves there was a court case in the South (in the 1920s, maybe?), where a negro was charged with raping an Italian woman. Now the law was clear on the point that if a white woman was raped, the penalty for a negro was death. The conundrum for the judge and jury was how to classify the Italian woman — was she white or not?

                                    Historically Northwest Europeans were thought of as the apex of the racial hierarchy, with Eastern and Southern Europeans racially inferior. The idea of a “white race” is relatively recent and owes much to non-white immigration.

                In places like New York, the Irish and later the Italians were competing for the same jobs as blacks. In many cases wage labor was preferable to an employer because there was no responsibility for the upkeep of the laborer. Slave labor probably fell by the wayside because of economics rather than some moral argument.

                Well said Dr. M.  On the subject of indenture, a compelling (and darkly amusing) read is Cracker Boy by James Lafond.  It’s based mainly on the personal writings of those who lived through it, and I learned a lot about the general system of white slavery.  As always seems to be the case, the usual suspects play a prominent role as both middle-men and direct owners.

                    Russians dont see ukranians as the devil and Russia itself has been fighting a limit war with Ukraine.
If for example Texas or the european vassals declare independence i am pretty sure washington would be very willing to immediately carpet bomb entire metro areas.
What i said is about americans being dumb or smart simply how they tend to see things.

                        But that is the American overlords, not an American. I can agree, however, that Americans tend to embrace evil/good duality more than Russians – one only need read Chekhov or Tolstoy to see the distance from Western thought.

                                I don’t know what this means. Chekhov lacked Western duality because he simply sketched with such a delicate touch; Tolstoy avoided Western condemnation of sin because he illuminated the righteous path, leaving the criticism secondary to the celebration.

Chekhov and Tolstoi were immersed in Christianity and Western philosophical thought. And their works are routinely taught in Western literature classes no different than Shakespeare and Goethe and Rabelais.

                                        Based on my response to the OP, the context is aversion to pure good/evil duality. You qualify Tolstoy and Chekhov as Western. Pretentious. Shit, Putin must be Parisian by your logic – for he knows of Rousseau. Contrast with Washington Irving, a real American writer.

Probably not right away. Blues really believe they don’t need the flyovers. They believe instead that civilizing the hicks is their White Man’s Burden. And think that, like a petulant child, so long as it’s not in their cities, a “time out” is the best course of action.
It’s how foreign policy is done, too.

                    Like I always tell normies, the difference between Ukraine and Russia is not unlike the difference between the USA and Canada, except that the ties are closer, more longstanding and deeper between the former two.
Now you tell me what would happen if China or Russia attempted a hostile takeover of Canada through rigged elections, with the aim of parking missiles and military bases on our border, with the aim of splitting up the USA into four or five different France’s instead of one superpower.
Do you think we would invade Canada if push came to shove? Of course.

            Wage slavery is more efficient than chattel slavery, because much of cost of caring for the slave can be socialized, in one way or another.
Also, there is the illusion of “freedom”, which only means the wage slave gets to choose his master, sometimes.

                I’m not sure but I suspect a large number of the slaves became sharecroppers after emancipation, which probably worked out cheaper for plantation owners. The level of exploitation was probably not less post-emancipation but became more abstract and indirect. Modern wage capitalism versus slave capitalism.

                    When I was in school the transition from childhood to adolescence was marked by being given things to read that aren’t textbooks, self-contextualizing material that we were trusted to understand. The first I remember were “slave narratives,” reminiscences (interviews, brief autobiographies) of recently freed blacks.Two things stood out as different from the textbooks’ story. The most obvious was that slave life as seen on TVwasn’t the life these people described. Our parents watchedRootsand the little Tarantinos among us knewBlacksnake!and other slave sexploitation stuff (the more artistically legitimate precursors toRoots). Every book had a picture of that same whipped guy. We learned from the source that reality was rarely so dramatic.Second, slaves were typically pro-slavery, not least because it placed them above—nearer to the ear of power than—poor whites, whose prospects and everyday lives were much worse. Slaves wererepresentedby their owners. Camaraderie, which in an emergency could be turned against the owner, arose from their shared relation to him. Crackers werebanished. Blacks freed into sharecropping lamented their reduction to that state of lonely helplessness, of not knowing anybody.(The greatest cause of poverty is not knowing anybody.)

The real antagonism was not between slave-owning whites and their slaves but between poor whites and slaves.

        “beautiful losers fear nothing more than winning as it reveals the ugliness of their reality”See: 85%-plus of Republicans in Washington as the prime example. I confess I didn’t have them figured out until Obama’s emergence, and the nomination of McCain. Obama would have been a tough opponent for anyone, so the Republicans didn’t even bother trying. They nominated a guy who wanted nothing more than to run an honorable losing campaign, because he’d been denied that chance years ago. And that’s exactly what he did.And then, when Obamacare starts getting pushed through, voters in Massachusetts of all places send a Republican Senator to DC to try to stop it, and the Republicans instead find a way to lose because they didn’t really want to win.And then, the Republicans start campaigning like crazy that they’ll repeal it. So the voters give them, by 2017, full control of DC. And the Republicans instead find a way to lose because they didn’t really want to win- with good old McCain himself casting a decisive vote, a spiteful loser to the end.And then, the Republicans who’ve campaigned for decades on ending Roe v Wade finally actually get it, and behave like deer caught in headlights. They never actually meant for that to happen, you see – it was only supposed to be a fundraising thing. Like everything those useless losers do. Give us money, we’ll say we’ll do XYZ, then never do XYZ, so give us more money so we can do XYZ and aren’t those Democrats awful? Who else you gonna vote for, suckers, it’s a two party system!

            For a different generation, it was Bob Dole in 1996, who was given the nomination as a parting gift, and then unceremoniously kicked out of the Senate (he tried to play it off as a campaign gambit to spend more time “on the trail” — my rear end; he was still hanging around his Senate office until the last paperweight was removed).

            I’d like to see a novel or movie where a Republican President has more muscle and vigor, isn’t afraid to use his power, and the weaselly Democrats are just thankful that Mr. President is magnanimous to them while still reminding them to know their place. As Anti-Sorkin as you can make it. Something that champions normal well-adjusted [White] people.

        Well, this is why globohomo instituted permanent vote by mail in 2020.  How is a populist going to win when elections moving forward are all rigged?2016 was very likely the last real election of our lifetimes; 2020 will be looked back historically as when globohomo cabal seized permanent power.  And due to demographic changes (20 million Democrat illegals in the past 4 years alone) we are at the stage where, like California, we are becoming a permanent one party state.  Once that happens, the intensity of shitliberalism will go parabolic unlike anything we have seen so far.Lastly, what happened in the Civil War is not properly understood.  It was a Rothschild domination operation.  In The Rothschilds, the Financial Rulers of Nations, John Reeves noted that when the family met in London in 1857 for a wedding, Prime Minister of England Benjamin Disraeli declared: “Under this roof are the heads of the family of Rothschild – a name famous in every capital of Europe and every division of the globe. If you like, we shall divide the United States into two parts, one for you, James, and one for you, Lionel. Napoleon will do exactly and all that I shall advise him.” Otto Von Bismark stated in 1867: “The division of the United States into two federations of equal force was decided long before the civil war by the high financial power of Europe. These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained in one block and as one nation, would attain economical and financial independence, which would upset their financial domination over the world. The voice of the Rothschilds predominated. They foresaw the tremendous booty if they could substitute two feeble democracies, indebted to the financiers, to the vigorous Republic, confident and self-providing. Therefore they started their emissaries in order to exploit the question of slavery and thus dig an abyss between the two parts of the Republic.” Rothschild family biographer Niall Ferguson notes a “substantial and unexplained gap” in private Rothschild correspondence between 1854-1860. He says all copies of outgoing letters written by the London Rothschilds during this Civil War period “were destroyed at the orders of successive partners”.

        Among committed leftists, it is common to find this framed 180 degrees to the opposite, that the Democrats are the controlled opposition designated losers who care only about fundraising and not winning, and the Republicans are the ruthless rulers who do whatever it takes to win. And we live in a right wing dystopia. I am not making this up. They really think this. I could introduce you to people who think this, in addition to the ones I see online. They have to think this, for leftism (for lack of a better descriptor) cannot ever see itself as holding the whip hand. It is always the rebel, fighting against The Man. In its own mind, anyway.

            The ones who think this way tend to be those that Vladimir Lenin called useful idiots. The reason there are so many is that the useful idiot category includes the overwhelming majority of the whole of shitlib woketards, always engaged exclusively in their feelings.As Mark Twain pointed out, it is much easier to bamboozle a man than it is to convince him he has been bamboozled. Applied here, this type is people who have been thoroughly duped, yet their egos/feelings will not allow them to even see this, let alone acknowledge it. Thus, their solution is to see the Republicans as the ruthless rulers, all istismphobes out to get them.This way, their egos are shielded from the reality that the leaders of their own “team” are merely using them and nothing more. The D types with the actual power do not do a thing for their useful idiots because they have no desire or intention to do so at all, not because they are “controlled opposition.”

            One insight, I think first phrased this simply by the goofball Aimee Terese, is fundamental:There is no left, only Democrats.“The left,” with incredibly rare true believer exceptions, gets what it wants all the time, because all they really want is whatever power says it’s about to do—”the feeling that power is increasing,” as Nietzsche put it. The bandwagon (or progress, or History) announces its next stop, and that’s where “we” were always going. (“Did you know that libertarians werealwaysfor gay marriage?”)See ya, losers!It’s not an ideal situation for power—if it has desires of its own.I’m for whateverisn’t a truly partisan sentiment. It satisfies a need without cultivating another. It’s an endless feed chute. The right reaction for those on the receiving end of it is to sit and be fat. Tohunger, to demand to see enemies’ blood, their children castrated, their memory erased, you have to think they deserve it.They don’t have to win! In fact, theynevercan, not even in the smallest thing, like a video game calling your character a man instead of “body type a.”What peoplereallywant is endless injury to other people who are already losers, to find a man stuck in the mud and push him a little farther down in it every day. But we haven’t evolved to think of ourselves that way.So, the guy in the mud is a Nazi, maybe a Confederate. He’s the greatest loser—but he wasthis closeto winning! And he’sthis closeto coming back!Etc. Too long. You get it.

        This transformation will be generational I think. The young white men with nothing to lose will likely be in the vanguard. The old grillers have too much to lose. The recent election in Germany showed this – the AfD did best among young men. It’s also possible we will see a “Fight Club”-like “Project Mayhem” among blue collar white men that brings the country to its knees.

        I’m fully in agreement that “beautiful loser” all but defines what’s left of the Conservative Industrial Complex.  They cling to their “principles” and lose happily because it saves them from taking any action and they can – at the same time – pat themselves on the back for being “moral”.  I think we have to recognize something far more sinister in the GOP as a whole though.  It’s become very clear over the last several years that the GOP will lose on purpose if it serves their ends.  Even now I’m certain there are many working behind the scenes to throw the election to Harris.  Not only are they not acting under some deference to rules, they will bizarrely break the rules themselves to ensure theirlossif that loss furthers the aims of their donors more than a win will.

            Correct. And they will justify undermining Trump based upon the notion that he is, like literally, Hitler. And you can’t have Hitler and muh Constitution. Thus, ratting out your constituents and subverting the electoral process–doing terrible violence to the very spirit of democracy they claim to worship–is actually the highest form of American patriotism. These people have internalized the beliefs of the Left.

            In conservative AZ circles, John McCain was decried for years and years as worthless to conservatives.  He proved this by voting against the repeal of Obama’s Affordable Care Act (ACA) when Trump assumed office and the Rep’s controlled Congress—even though prior he voted for repeal many time before when such repeal was politically impossible.  He was a typical phony Republican professing conservative values.  He also argued strenuously against building the Wall when illegal immigration soared under Obama.McCain ran a pretty good political machine which Trump upset.  Now there is a full blown war between Trumpists and RINO’s (as represented by McCain) for the heart of the AZ Rep party.  The Republican remnants of the McCain machine have even come out against the current slate of AZ candidates (Trumpists) for Senate and House.  McCain’s son has officially registered as a Democrat and now campaigns for Harris.  Yep, these folk campaign for Dem’s to spite their (supposed) party.And yet, in light of such 5th columnists as McCain, there are still folk here—like the Rep party leader of AZ, who argue that we need to select Rep candidates that can win, even if they are not conservative.  With friends like that…..

                McCain wasn’t a RINO, he was a perfect example of them.

        This column is apropos for me because I just finished listening to Scott Adams blather incoherently about how it would be a great thing if Trump, should he win, appointed Elon Musk to re-engineer the US government — but of course we’d keep the Constitution, Adams says! We want to keep the rulebook (close to his actual words), apparently oblivious to the fact that “the rulebook” prohibits Musk from “re-engineering” the government. Musk can’t repeal the Pendleton Act, he can’t fire civil servants in union protected jobs. He can’t repeal any other laws, abolish any agencies, refuse to spend the funds allocated by Congress to each agency.Unless he throws out the rulebook. But guys like Adams would never go there, because that would require a dictatorship; it would require force of arms. Just like the Civil War did a century and a half ago.

            The “rulebook” was made by and for White, Christian, European men in the 18th century.  The didn’t work in the 19th century nor the 20th.  Even if Whites could establish a modern-day polity, they would not work in the 21st.   They were based on supposedly universal premises that did not comport with reality.Times, people and technology have rendered them obsolete.

        Well I think you hit the nail on the head when you said the guys that play fast and loose with the rules undermine the game. The flaw is that the losers inevitably, eventually adapt. All empires rise and fall, all champions are eventually dethroned. That “win at all costs” mindset eventually shoots itself in the balls because there’s no point playing against cheaters. We see this in the rise of the BRICS. Historically, we see it in the regular expulsion of the jews from their host countries.All empires ris and fall, as do all champions. Dissidents had better have a plan because the current regime is running on fumes.

        I would rather Trump win, myself, but I don’t see how campaigning as Romney 2012, but with more dope and abortions, will get him there. I definitely don’t see how it is better for his odds if he does that instead of campaigning the way he did that actually got him victory in 2016. Also, when I see Rabbi Schmuley Boteach bragging about his association with new Trump surrogates Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr., I am not encouraged at the prospects of a revolt against the regime or even of avoiding World War 3. If this new cuck version of Trump wins, it will be because the Dems put up one of the worst politicians ever to oppose him, one whose poll numbers decrease every time she opens her mouth. But what does that mean for the next four years? Tough to say.

            “I don’t see how campaigning as Romney 2012, but with more dope and abortions, will get him there.”To me it’s in the same ballpark / continuation of such brilliant talking points during 2020 like the black unemployment numbers, pushing red flag laws that disarm people without due process, the black platinum plan, patting himself on the back for the vax &amp; attacking governors for opening up top early.Its all deliberately geared towards people who will never ever vote for him &amp; needlessly causes friction with the people he needs to try to win back over who felt betrayed by him. Even among the diehards whether it’s people who like him or just hate kamala who will vote for him no matter what its not making them excited to vote for him.The Romney comparison is really good, I’m getting a very similar vibe to that campaign, that should be like a handbook “What NOT to do when running for president.” The nonstop talk about fighting Iran for israel is to me very reminiscent of Romney constantly talking about stirring up conflict with Russia when everyone was fatigued after the disastrous Iraq war &amp; bush years.In this case I think this israel business is actually worse on multiple levels, the optics have become so toxic even the people who are typically down for whatever in regards to helping them are flinching at what they’re doing. That &amp; the money we’re pouring on them &amp; ukraine while people are getting bled dry just buying groceries, it really doesn’t look good.All Trump has to do is talk about crime, the economy / ending these money pit wars &amp; finally the border &amp; that’s it. He should steer any questions not related to those things back around &amp; he’d have an extremely positive ambience surrounding his campaign &amp; that’d go a long way to making him sympathetic if they rig it again.I don’t know what the hell he or his advisors are thinking, the last four years was a golden platter for him to place these basic talking points on to deliver to the voters. Right now he’s doing the equivalent of taking that platter &amp; throwing it away like a frisbee for some baffling reason I cannot understand.

                Yep. When it comes to dope and abortion, all he has to say is “these are state issues, 10th amendment, let them resolve it, let’s talk about things under the purview of the federal government, like the border.” He is not just wading into stupid conflicts he has no business stepping into, he is walking right into the trap that Democrats laid out for him. They WANT to make this election about abortion, because if they do, they will win. I don’t know who told Trump to try to claim that he will fight for “reproductive rights”, but that person needs to be fired.This election really is a layup for him. Even people on the coasts know that things were better in 2019 than they are now. It’s a good message. Just keep hammering that. He did it during the debate, and it worked out great, with or without the mushbrain opposing him. He can keep doing it with Kamala, yet for some reason his campaign staff freaked out and decided he needed to take a hard move to the left and say all this stuff to piss off people he doesn’t need to piss off and cannot afford to piss off. It’s crazy!

                    Very well said man, that’s exactly how he should handle those kinds of questions.You know now that you mention mushbrain when they did the switcharoo putting kamala in his place that seems to be when this all started. I mean at least that’s my perception, I admittedly haven’t been paying that much attention, I just see headlines &amp; the like for the most part without really digging into it. Maybe I’m wrong but I just don’t remember seeing anything like this when it was still biden but ever since the switch all I’m hearing about is completely irrelevant &amp; divisive stuff like things you mentioned in your original comment. That &amp; it seems like when he picked JD Vance is also when I started seeing these headlines on my homepage whenever I use my computer &amp; open a browser. That also applies to JD himself he seems to be going out there &amp; saying things that really serve no purpose whatsoever other than to kick up dust for zero gain.Like saying Trump would veto a national abortion ban because he’s just so against abortion. I also read Daily Stormer but I typically don’t read anything related to the election but obviously I see the news headlines he posts. I saw something about Trump complaining about a 6 week ban &amp; again, I know I’m sounding like a broken record here but I keep finding myself wondering why the hell is both Trump &amp; JD trying to suck up to people who will never vote for him.After being hyper invested in the last election I’m basically deliberately trying to limit my exposure so in a sense I’m kind of getting a low information normie style experience &amp; it’s exactly as you describe &amp; it’s NOT looking good at all.You pretty much nailed on the head with what you said about sticking to the states rights line &amp; that’s not like this is some crazy complex script he needs to memorize lol. He needs to follow that KISS acronym: keep it simple stupid!One last thing I’ll say is I distinctly remember reading headlines saying the Trump campaign freaked out when they swapped biden &amp; I just brushed it off as pro kamala propaganda like oh no Trump is now afraid of kamala the moron &amp; he needs to redo his entire strategy even though that makes no sense. But now? I don’t know maybe that wasn’t propaganda. Then again I could be wrong, my view of when this started could be way off &amp; he could’ve been walking into these obvious traps &amp; shooting himself in the foot well before the switch happened.Regardless the closer we get to the election the more people will naturally tend to pay attention so even if my memory is off this is still bad &amp; not the time to be going off into the weeds on these sorts of pointless issues. I’d be lying if if I said I wasn’t curious if it really was the switch that caused Trump’s advisors to decide to switch to these talking points. Kamala is not popular, I never see any political signs for her, not once have I seen one, everytime she’s on TV she’s grating &amp; she seemingly has no policies as far as I can tell. If anything she moreso than biden makes the simple trifecta of economy/border/crime- all of which she &amp; biden made way worse- an even more effective campaign against her. At least I would think anyway, that’s all I hear about when I discuss politics with normies it’s so damn simple.

        Another way you can look at a game is if it is a finite game or infinite game.  The spiritually aware play the infinite game, while the trapped in the body play the finite game.  The progressive plays a finite game in that they think heaven can be brought to earth by overlooking the rules of nature. Our side wants to play the infinite game because we want to keep the game going even after we are gone and stay in harmony with nature.  (((Certain groups))) look at life as a finite game of attaining power, money, and subjugation of others, where our side values the infinite game of beauty, real justice, and the love of community.  There is always an end to the finite game. The infinite game will always continue in some form.

            There are myriad reasons to loathe organized sports, but Z’s critique is not among them. For, while it’s true that most coaches subvert the rules in the monomaniacal drive to win, this behavior is not decisive. The teams that win are still, in the main, the ones with the most talented players and the most gifted coaches. (In the college game, the winners are now the franchises with the largest NIL war chests.) The willingness to bend the rules is a marginal factor.

        “prefer subjugation over uncertainty”. This is concisely as one can put it on why a majority of Harris supporters want her, and Biden before her. Basically a more succinct way of me explaining to my wife the other day when she just can’t fathom why any one would vote for her.In a way the minor panic over Tucker’s interview with an alt-history guy is a tangential example of people ,even on our supposed side, getting twisted when historical narratives and myths are challenged. It leads to uncertainty, and the timid don’t like that.Look forward to a piece from you Z on his interview.

                Yes, very telling. He even made an explicit point — twice — to dumb it down for them, saying “Just because you say X is bad does not mean you believe Y is good” in explicit reference to Churchill and Hitler.I grew up with a guy, known him 40 years now. Spent a lot of time with him the last five years, hadn’t over the past 20. Never had too many political conversations with him. He’s a Bush conservative, got into politics after 9/11, but grew up saturated in Reagan and conservatism.Last six months or so, I realized the depth of the Black/White dichotomy in this guy from his education. It’s an electric fence. He won’t go beyond it. He’s not capable of it, or it’s been conditioned, or a mixture of both. But it doesn’t matter. He can’t get beyond it even when you point it out to him. He glitches when I do it.It’s been isolating and atomizing to bump up against this with several other people as well. I can’t imagine any of them listening to someone disparage Churchill and not have their wiring start sparking. It’s a challenge to their entire model of reality, which shows just how deep the Founding Myth is, and why most of us won’t be alive to see its death.

            Most people throughout history have always preferred ‘safe’ subjugation to uncertain independence.  Most people are neither very bright nor very capable.  They don’t want freedumb, they want to be taken care of but without too many heavy-handed limitations.  While any form of human society requires some rules and social norms, the Big Lie of Equality means no one can be excluded for any reason, except those who insist on some basic rules and norms.  Ergo Klownworld.  Satan’s panopticon and playground, happily enabled by his acolytes.

            They are continuing to lose control of the narrative. That is why, in the end, I am convinced they will pull out all the stops for Kamala. Beyond any policy changes Trump may (or may not) implement, the real threat is to the mythology that justifies the current ruling order.
If she “wins” I expect the crackdown will be brutal.

            Maybe. I think if I were king for a day, first thing I’d do is abdicate. I’m just not interested in running/ruining other peoples’ lives.
But that’s the point of politics. Incentives predict that those drawn to politics would skew through self-selection towards a desire for power over others. And evidence is that’s what it does.
Ostensibly, the Constitution was the best try at limiting politics yet conceived. It failed. Got any better ideas? Or is it time to just rip political power out by the roots and get on with life?

        Then as now, morality had a huge part in abolishing slavery. I don’t think it was simply the North being spiteful. There were a ton of powerful Yanks that thought slavery was reprehensible and also the south was backward and needed civilizing and industrializing.
If the North were simply trying to get one up on the South, why did Republicans go whole hog on reconstruction and putting blecks in national and state legislatures? Remember that leftist crusades started with abolition. Shortly afterward we had the suffrage and temperance movements.

            Christianity in the USA started focusing less on salvation and more on helping the neighbor. This Christianity without Jesus and focused on this world is the origin of the progressive religion. After this, the doctrine was used by different power groups to get what they wanted, by identifying their power grab as a helping the neighbor. Each of these power grabs changed the religion.This is structured like a series of crusades to bring paradise to earth. The abolition movement was its first cause. Then the temperance movement, suffrage, civil rights, feminism, LGBTI and multiculturalism.There is no contradiction between power grab and moral crusade. People who want power justify themselves thinking that they do it for the good. Nobody wants to admit he is a bad person so everybody builds rationalizations to justify the most vile acts. Somebody like Hillary Clinton showcases this mixture of corruption and sanctimony. In her eyes, she is an outstanding human person, who has fight her entire life to help the oppressed people (neighbor is an outdated term). About the money…well, it is only part of what deserves because she is such a good fighter for the good. It is not about the money…it is about fighting the oppression, while one is living a life of luxury.

            Reconstruction was as brutal as it was because Southerners were figuring out the outsourcing model — sharecropping. Yes, slavery was lucrative if you were already a large slaveowner. As with any other livestock, there’s the calf crop. Smaller slaveholds were always on the edge because of the massive capital investment. A young fieldhand would sell for over $1000 — 50 oz of gold.Sharecropping made it so a minor landholder could split his acreage up into plots, then wait for his sharecroppers to drop off the tribute. No expenses other than taxes. If one of them gets old or sick or just doesn’t produce enough, boot him and dozens of poor will be begging to take his place.Thing is, sharecropping can’t be applied to factories…

            No one cared about Blacks, before and after the CW.  That is shown by history.  Slavery was a useful tool to rally the populace around a “brother war”.  Slavery was abolished, and then allowed to basically continue in the South (and North) via segregation and sharecropping.  The entire war was fought to maintain the “Union” and finish the job of expansion of the USA to the Pacific.It (CW) was a ploy used by the Federal Government to break the back of State’s Rights as outlined in the Constitution. It worked.  We fail to appropriately appreciate this due to a lengthy timeline from there to now.  Nonetheless, here we are—an all encompassing Federal scourge going all out to finish the job of absorbing the States and destroying the Rights outlined in the Constitution as envisioned by the Founders.

            Seems to me the war turned on two things: Lee’s invasion of the North, and the Emancipation Proclamation.Lee’s invasion changed the dynamic, because the South was now playing aggressor instead of defender. Now the North was injured and threatened, no longer half-heartedly conducting war.The Proclamation was a result and a desperate move, imo. It unleashed the radical abolitionists, burning hatred of the South and Southern culture. I would say it’s true that the North’s homunculus is a spiteful mutant— Thaddeus Stevens being a great example imo. I think that’s the case for any culture that exalts literacy and learning. Idealism, lost in the mind, nuts. For the South, maybe a character like Forrest.However, most Northerners weren’t nuts and didn’t ultimately hate the South, and Reconstruction was reined in after the blood cooled. But yeah, it would seem the genie was out of the bottle.PS speaking of homunculi, Pike would be a strange, hybrid case. Maybe the sort that should be of more interest these days.Also, the hero/villain Lincoln, I think, if you give him a full reading, was ambivalent, resistant, ultimately swept along. I do believe his one principle was Union, whatever it took. I think he gets more credit than he’s due, tbh.

        I would disagree on this partially. There have been long periods of equilibrium where nations, and political parties, “play by the rules”. Examples include the stability from the Congress of Vienna up to Kaiser Wilhelm post-Bismarck, and Democrats and Republicans from roughly 1945 up to 2008.In the Post Cold War world, you had the Clintons and Bush families being roughly indistinguishable save at the margins from core policies and politics. Each won “small” and the “rules” were that various technocrats would do “incentives” policies that did not change much and wins/losses were small. Similar to the unwritten rules in baseball, enforced by pitchers throwing at players who violate them, and things in College Football like Bill Goldberg being the enforcer against those who hit Deon Sanders too hard during his college playing time. [Yes really]. Stable systems rely on most players abiding by most of the rules most of the time otherwise escalation becomes existential and existential crises tend to supplant existing elites with more powerful/able new ones.Most armies for example shudder at prolonged industrial wars as most Generals are incompetent and will be supplanted by people like Sherman, Grant, Patton etc. Out of necessity, if nothing else.The “rules” prior to Obama informally forbid anti-White identity politics for various solid and wise reasons. Obama vaulted past Establishment fave Hillary! by violating those informal but solid rules, and we cannot and will not go back. Trump is the White/Hispanic plus some angry blacks Identitarian anti-Obama candidate. [Blacks are angry in California that there will be for now, no reparations while illegals get free health care and $125,000,000 free loans for houses, no not kidding].Now it looks like something very big is in the offing from Obama. We have coordinated press campaigns that the Constitution is outmoded and that free speech is a threat and to arrest Elon Musk. I think the informal “rule” that we don’t have overt coups (Obama initiated an informal one against Trump just like I called it) is probably going to be violated. We had all these rules: A. Don’t use lawfare against opponents, B. Don’t pursue former Presidents with lawfare and assassination attempts, C. Don’t gin up anti-Jewish sentiment on campus, D. Don’t empower the extreme Sanders left. All violated, with impunity, and will continue to do so until some new equilibrium is found.Rule breaking, once it starts, it does not stop until so many are threatened that you get a Thermidorean Reaction. First mover advantage is just so powerful. [Mus,k Zuck, Dalio, Dimon, Ackman, Theil must know they are on the list. ]

            “Examples include the stability from ….. and Democrats and Republicans from roughly 1945 up to 2008.”Are we living in the same world?  Arguably the democrats started the machine up again in 1932 and still have not relented.  It’s been nonstop insanity from them from 1932 to today.  Their power to do this has waxed and waned for brief periods between 32 and today, but to the extent they could, they have been doing this from 32 to today.  Recall we had an FDR court (all 9 justices) well into the mid 50s and some beyond.  We had the insanity of the 60s and then all the affirmative action and set asides for blacks and women etc etc etc.

        I was an officer anti-immigration group and wanted to sign my letters to the editor of the local paper with a pen name and my office title.  ie. Peyton Fahrquar, Treasurer, Citizens for Responsible Immigration.  The president of the group was displeased with the use of a pen name.  It offended his sense of honesty.  Well, I’d rather keep my day job than be honest.We compromise and I used a pen name but left out affiliation with the group.  That was too bad, because when I used the group’s name, it immediately got a response from the newspaper, sending a reporter interview me.Likewise, when I suggested we organize a covert campaign to influence the Republican political convention, other group officers protested that would be underhanded.These folks, as dedicated as they were to the cause would constantly eschew the “dirty tricks” needed to move to the cause forward.

            Reading down the comments, I see the Constitution come up a lot.  Likewise in the anti-immigration group.  I kept trying to tell them, as soon as they say “The Constitution”, they will be pigeon-holed as just some boomer conservative cranks and most people will shut them off.I advocated going to the belly of the beast at the local Organic Farmers and Growers fair and setting up a booth to talk about had bad mass immigration is for the environment, but that would never get any traction with that crowd if we started talking about “The Constitution”.  We might as well start talking about “The Jews” or “The Gold Standard”.  Folks recognize those as words for cranks and kooks.

                The “science” is settled. Immigration has no effect on the environment because Wall Street financier David Gelbaum says so.“It was a very bad day for the cause of protecting America’s wilderness and resources some years back when the Sierra Club secretly took over $100 million in tainted donations from Wall Street investor David Gelbaum. The enormous contribution came with strings attached, namely the stipulation that America’s flagship green organization would not mention excessive immigration as harmful to the environment generally and resource preservation in particular”The Social Contract – How Deeply Did Wall Street Investor David Gelbaum Damage the Sierra Club?

        I live this post – in large part because it desacralizes “The Rules”. The dictates our oppressors try to force on us, which work against our interests, have no moral component that we must respect.  There is only the practical consideration of cost/benefit/risk in defying them.Normal people in the US must learn to embrace subversion of bad rules, as is common in many other countries. Ways to get around the system need to become part of normal thinking, normal business.  Make the cost of ensuring compliance too high to bear.   Render every absurd pronouncement from the overlords down to idle words – mere suggestions.  Often the risk is very low already, given a few moments’ thought.

        What’s hilarious about this dynamic with Trump is that hewantsto be the slave, he’s never stopped trying to prove how he’s not hitler to the ruling class. Only in the minds of the people who want him gone is he truly a threat to the system but the mere act of calling out them out for their bullshit during his first presidential run was just too much for them to handle. They reacted this way even though in the end he stuffed his cabinet with the very people in his party who opposed, denounced &amp; undermined him. Words &amp; a minor four year speedbump was enough to send them into a ceaseless hysteria. Big picture not a whole lot changed neither during nor after his presidency, we’re still going full steam ahead on all the big agenda items.I wish he was what they constantly claim him to be but I can’t complain about the fact he caused that reaction. If not for him we would’ve no doubt stayed on auto pilot &amp; slowly decayed instead of suddenly making a mad dash to quickly turn the entire West into a de-industrialized third world shithole. That while also simultaneously trying to start a fight with every one of our superpower peers- all at once, no less. All this because he insulted these people &amp; won the election. Amazing.Reminds me of the reaction black women have when they hear the word “no.” It’s so utterly foreign to them &amp; such an affront to their sense of self &amp; their entitlement they can’t cope with the sheer audacity of it &amp; instinctively fly into a rage. Not only do they virtually never hear that word they’ve been so conditioned to never hearing it that they can’t process it in a remotely healthy manner when it’s said to them in defiance. Same energy is at play here with the reaction to Trump, it’s one big chimp out.

            Eventually. My guess is turn of the century or maybe a bit later. The cotton picker wasn’t developed ’til the ’30s, but if not for all the destruction of the brother war, there might have been the capital, human and otherwise, to bring that about few decades earlier.
If evil bastards like Thaddeus Stevens actually cared, they would have worked to make slavery obsolete rather than just imprison or shoot people who disagreed.

            Mechanization was already in effect in the South on plantations.  Slaves were “moved”, if you will, to other States and other manual labor handling different crops not yet subject to technological innovation.  (I forget the details and am not interested in looking them back up.)However, it seems the association of slave utility and large plantation farming is simplistic.  Hell, I could use a house slave myself, I’m tired of doing most of the daily maintenance around here.  How about your local Walmart?  Can’t they use slaves to stock shelves and sweep floors?  How about a new Black nanny for every pregnant White woman?You get my point.  It’s not that “wage slavery” is not more efficient, or mechanization replaces manual labor,  it’s rather that chattel slavery had run its moral course here in America.  A generation later in Brazil. The West was done with it.

        Fertilizing those seeds are The Regime’s reaction to the first winner with a will to power who arrived to challenge them. They are going after other major potential rivals. The infiltrators and occupiers got their seats by cunning but also by virtue of a system where the best pursued their self interest on the outer periphery of the system.They aren’t going to accept being told by Bugs Bunny to just go stare at a pile of shoes and kick the ground. They aren’t going to accept that they can be extradited and jailed. Massive lawfare. Assassination attempts. Forced Humiliation rituals and acts of submission and subservience. Rogue warfare. Palace coups. Extradition and arrest. The War in The Clouds is heating up.Down in the dirt, we are getting crushed. The Great Replacement is in extremely high gear as is the controlled demolition of our cultural heritage.For all of Trump’s shortcomings his fight will be a fire that is going to take hold. Someone is out there who doesn’t have the generational baggage that Trump does and who is far more politically astute and whose fight is far more honed. We need to act in our local spheres because as we know from history the Clouds hold the power but the winner will have the people and those who have something to offer will be sought out first.I had a friend who was just in Denver. That city is putting out advisories to women not to be alone or out at all past dark in specific neighborhoods. Denver has been Africanized. Denver of all places. As for the demands we must hold when The Clouds reach out, I think support in sovereign locales that are ours to build how we see fit should be at the top of the list. In the meantime, within the confines of the current Regime, don’t wait for permission. Go out their quietly and with speed and build your redoubt with people you trust.

        Can someone remind me of the name of the notable Southerner who opposed the South (and wrote a book about it during the CW) not because he was pro-black freedom or the North, but because he was against the importation of blacks and working class whites being shut out?  At least I believe that was the jist of his argument; could be wrong.

            If I understood your rather convoluted question, such a person does not exist because the importation of slaves was banned in 1808 the first moment the Constitution allowed it, and with pretty serious support in the South. The big “ranchers” running a couple hundred head knew it would increase the sale price of their stock.

            From ChatGPT:”The notable Southerner you’re referring to is likely Hinton Rowan Helper. He was a white Southern critic of slavery, but his opposition was based on his belief that slavery harmed poor white Southerners by limiting their economic opportunities. Helper expressed these views in his controversial book, “The Impending Crisis of the South,” published in 1857. In this book, he argued that slavery benefited the wealthy slave-owning elite at the expense of non-slaveholding whites, whom he saw as being economically oppressed by the system. However, Helper was not an advocate for racial equality; his opposition to slavery was rooted in his concern for white laborers rather than a moral opposition to the institution itself.”

        It’s funny that leftists themselves don’t appear to understand this.   Weaponization of rules undermines the rules themselves.But you really have to wonder if the “right” in this society will begin to see the rules for what they are and revolt against them.  I have my doubts.

        There is a DR site I used to read provided a perfect example of this mindset. This place literally set up a super duper secret password channel to be able to say such naughty words as “Nazi” and “Jew”, like those aren’t going to be lost in the millions of times they are used every day on the internet.I mean, there is excluding the weirdo element of the internet, and then there is behaving with such cringing servility to the rules of TPTB that the taste of boot is permanently implanted in your mouth, especially when you are basically asking glowies in Virginia to be half your user base day one.When you are engaging in the same tactics that trannies on Discord do to engage in discussions about mutilating their genitals, it should probably be a wake-up call. Might as well tattoo “Bitch” on the forehead.

        The Republican platform of 1860 was to forbid slavery in the territories acquired after the Mexican War but to preserve it in the states where it was already legal. There was actually a constitutional amendment proposed to make slavery permanent in the slave states of 1860 (supported by Lincoln). This was unacceptable to the southern elite, as it meant the political power of the free states would eclipse that of the South, which would endanger slavery regardless of the constitution (which could be amended to remove the slavery guarantee).

                        Fair enough. As more than one have pointed out, though, most people are fine with a more or less comfortable slavery. We can’t give them ambition to be something better, and can’t give them skills if that is what they lack.
If we are doing the brother’s keeper thing, the best we can do is encourage those who can but are too unmotivated to act. The rest, it’s more merciful to let them live in their dreamworld.

                            I have posted here repeatedly that we still, generally and where I live, have a high quality of life. I will not LaVoy Finicum myself. Anyone who thinks that they can make an effective gesture that will change the minds of the masses is living in a dreamworld. The dreamers are the oppressors, but they are completely unmoveable, and they are Legion.And before I get some snarky responses, I have probably awoken more than anyone else posting here in my life and work (Z exempted), and I’m still in my 30s.I will not, however, make myself a target. I would give my life, immediately and completely, to save a couple certain people from immediate danger. Beyond that, I have to consider how best to serve my darlings in terms of the odds. Wage slave, more or less, is it.I use that term a bit hyperbolically, for I have no debt other than my house, and I do not tie my existence to my possessions; further, I have a satisfying job that I actually like and excel at. But, ultimately, I am tied to work to support those I care for. My goal is not stuff, but I am still a wage slave.But, back to the opening point, life is still good. Look at anyone reading this – in comfort, on a computer or phone, and relaxing. We work, we relax, we pay our bills. We are slaves, for our labor goes to serving another end, but what are the alternatives? LaVoy Finicum. I always use his name because everyone else forgets.

                                Oh, I wasn’t counseling that! Rather that no one need work for a boss other than himself. Now granted, many have made choices that preclude some options, so you have to live within those limits. Design constraints. And the older you get, the more design constraints there are, largely because of self-inflicted golden handcuffs.
If wage slavery bothers you that much, putting up with it for another 30 years is going to destroy you. Examine your design constraints. There’s likely a whole lot more degrees of freedom than you think.

        Would disagree that victory in any particular game/tournament in sports is the only goal for a team and that exploiting loopholes is always the hallmark of winners. This seems a very cynical view of what sport is supposed to be, although I understand Z is perhaps simply trying to draw a parallel with politics.At least back in the day, sportsmanship was held in the highest regard by the game’s authorities, the players and spectators, and victories achieved in unsportsmanlike fashion, or so perceived, were scandalous.Fast leg theory bowling in cricket for example, was highly controversial precisely because some thought it unsportsmanlike and this charge was deeply felt by those who believed it to be legitimate strategy and play because although they wanted to win, they wanted to win cricket, their chosen sport, and they felt a need for all concerned to concede they were winning legitimatelyWhat does a team profit by winning if their methods degrade their chosen sport?

        Most of the points in today’s essay ring true, but I would dispute that slavery “was fantastically successful as an economic practice.” Slavery as practiced in the New World probably WAS profitable, although perhaps not always “fantastically” so. In fact, one of the strongest arguments for its existence over many centuries was simply to consider the falsification of that statement. If owning and working slaves had been a net-money loser, it would have been illogical for any planter or other slaver to enter the business. In other words, one needs look no further than base greed, the profit motive.Undoubtedly slavery was an issue in antebellum America. But that’s still ignoring the economic viability of the peculiar institution. Great Britain and other nations had abolished slavery decades before we did. In fact, we were one of the last European powers to do so. I think Spain hung on a few decades longer. Right there is a hanging question: Was Great Britain on the brink of civil war in the early 19th century? I’m pretty sure they weren’t. This doesn’t mean there weren’t rival political factions in play; that’s almost always true. Of course it’s possible the evil slave-masters were overcome by ideology. But isn’t it more likely the slaveholders saw the sun setting on the enterprise and made the best of a bad situation. It’s even possible they saw greater profit by doing something else.But remains the most likely and yet often overlooked reason why slavery gradually fell out of favor: because with time it made less sense economically. The “obsolete farm equipment” literally became so precisely because of  the mechanization of agriculture and other progress wrought by the industrial revolution.And note that above claim primarily applies to chattel slavery as practiced in the New World in general, and in the US in particular. Slavery has existed in many flavors over the years. Nor has it magically vanished, banished by Enlightenment sensibility. Slavery or near-slavery is still the lot of life in many backward parts of the globe.

        I bet pretty quickly, within 10 years, of  black Africans being taken to live under white protection and patronage, theywere lined up on those western shores at a chance to escape the chaos and  insecurity of African life to live among our ancestors.
maybe the cheap labor revisionists are right: African slavery was a cheap labor scheme of the mercantile class and all of us are living the results of their get rich quick scheme.
not that there’s anything wrong with slavery as such, but black slaves? So far from Africa? Not a great long term plan, anglicans!

        The North kept losing to the South within the rules of the game of politics as set forth in the Constitution. Therefore, they did what winners always seek to do and that is change the rules.Not at all.Before 1860, the South had an outsized influence on national politics. Consider the number of Presidents from the South. In 1860, the South found out that someone could be elected President without any support from the South. This was a first. The primary reason for this change  was that immigration went primarily to the North, not to the South. That tipped the population balance, and thus the electoral balance, in favor of the North.The South saw that this population disparity would only get worse, which meant that the South would permanently lose its outsized influence on national politics. Secession was, in effect, the South taking its ball and going home once it saw it could no longer win the game.The South saw that the rules no longer favored the South, due to the changes in relative population, so it stopped playing the game. The North didn’t change the rules of the game. Changing conditions, not changing the rules, enabled a President to be elected without any support from the South.

        The wars between nation’s are also winner-takes-all spats. Boosted (or dragged down) by their economies, nation’s look enviously at rich countries like the USA, “Arsenal of Democracy.” A good banker on your side is worth a fully decked out military division.

        The American political system — a trifecta of idealism, wealth and power — weeds out the losers from the winners in a ruthless Darwinian process. This is part of the reason the rich are worshipped in the U.S. — they appear to beat the House in a gambling game called capitalism. In politics, the rules haven’t changed much in generations — make the other guy look bad, and be the one the voter wants to have a beer with. But behind the scenes it’s the donor rich pulling all the strings. As the internet’s The Young Turks has observed time and again, the winners of the economic game determine the winners of the political game.Remember too that rich men like stock buyer Warren Buffett and schlock writer Stephen King may say things like they want higher taxes, but they come from cultures of egalitarianism where low men are supposed to see eye to eye with high. They want to be liked &amp; respected. The average rich man, however, would rather have another 10 million dollars than 10 million likes on his social media account. A disregard for society’s norms is part of the reason he got rich.And finally, what does the corruption of democracy by financial interests say about the average citizen? The legendary griller, crouched and ensconced by his BBQ in the backyard, has more important things to worry about than the purity of his leaders. Like who’s going to bet on and win the Superbowl this year.— Greg (www.dark.sport.blog)
