        Happy Thanksgiving to Z and all of the posters who come here regularly.I can honestly say I have learned quite a bit since meandering over to this site. I didn’t realize how much I didn’t know or understand.Frankly, I don’t know how you do it Z. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the reading; yet you produce content consistently.
Have a blessed holiday season everyone.

        Lovely piece. Happy Thanksgiving, Zman, and the commenters here.Other expats former or present will acknowledge this: any group of Americans, and I include even blacks here in this narrow sense, who are somewhere abroad will if at all possible celebrate Thanksgiving in some way. It is the one true national holiday and the essence of a people, as deracinated as they are. For the longest time a full-court press was made either to eliminate the holiday altogether or to make it indistinguishable from Christmas, but that ultimately failed spectacularly. I would submit the refusal to give up Thanksgiving is dissidence in its purest form and indicates all may not be lost. A nation is a people, and its government is a fleeting attempt to control them and, of late, replace them. Continuation of tradition undermines the erasure. Pile on and avoid all retailers and propagandists the next few days or longer. Resistance is delicious.

            Yep. One of favorite Thanksgivings was in Germany. An English friend who had lived in the US loved the holiday and invited to his house to have dinner with his wife and a mix of Americans and Brits.
It was a great evening except for his hideous wife, who for some reason hated the US. She even said that there was “nothing to see in America.” The room broke out in laughter at her stupidity, after which she shut up. Fun time.
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!

                I had a similar experience in Italy in the Navy decades ago.  I did my best to go native without even realizing what I was doing, however I was/am American and Thanksgiving  smokes out Americans of whatever hue or background.  My place became a little America on that day filled with young Navy guys and an assortment of Italians who mostly had relatives in America.  Of course the template was the story learned in elementary school of Pilgrims and Indian guests with the Italians playing the role of Indians.  I remember their graciousness in putting up with our hobbled together feast of a turkey and various things out of boxes and cans bought at the base commissary.Of course, there was no instant communication with the home country and family back then and even a phone call to the States was prohibitively expensive except for emergencies.  So, we gathered together with select native guests to stuff ourselves, drink local alcohol,  and throw American footballs to each other in the street.God bless Z and all here.  I’m grateful and honored to be in your company.

            So very true, Jack. I ceased patronizing McDonald’s lo about a dozen years again when they forbade employees from wishing customers a happy Thanksgiving. As Z said, a camp, a very bad camp indeed for scum such as this.

            I’m very interested with  comment.  Was it an official attempt to eliminate Thanksgiving? Or is it a subtle attempt just to lump Thanksgiving and Christmas up into one big holiday?

                It was primarily a commercial attempt to merge the holidays (when the national holiday was proclaimed FDR actually touted it in part to boost Christmas sales). In Z’s West Virginia, I think the ACLU sued several years back to prevent the governor from proclaiming it to have religious connotations, and similar state-adjacent efforts were made via the courts. For a period, some cities refused to acknowledge the holiday but those efforts faded away.

            So hard to square that with my memories of Moscow 1981-1982.  Now it’s AINO where I worry about being surveilled and/or arrested.  Although, to be honest, other than hang-up phone calls and such, I wasn’t really bothered in Moscow.

        First off, happy Thanksgiving to you, Z.  I am eternally grateful for all that you do here and to all of the amazing scholars who post regularly on this site.  You are all truly my people.One can possibly understand the ingratitude of black people, but the endless complaining from new arrivals is maddeningSorry but I can’t agree that blacks should be ungrateful.  If it weren’t for us, they’d be drinking piss and mud water with bones in their noses, living in grass and mud huts that blow over from a stiff breeze.  They should be more grateful than anyone that they ended up here.  Instead, they make us miserable and destroy everything they touch.I hope everyone has a wonderful Thanksgiving weekend.

            Holiday TV was inundated by the usual “see the poor starving big-eyed Biafran children, won’t you please open your hearts and give generously” ads, but unfortunately I am old enough to remember those same ads from the 1960’s, and if they haven’t learned how to be self sufficient and self governing in 60 years, to heck with them. That skinny black child you bleedin’ hearts feed will grow up to be the machete wielding wild eyed druggie murderer, who will leave behind yet more fatherless children for us to save. I am glad to be white, American, and educated.

                Q. What do you get when you feed 500 starving Africans?
A. 5,000 starving Africans.
An uncharitable sentiment, perhaps, for a sacred day such as this, but I now reserve my charity for my own people and those who have some hope of profiting by it.

                    But it’s not an ungrateful comment.  Misplaced charity created 4500 more unhappy people than there would otherwise have been. Like any other self-destructive behavior, they have to admit they have a problem and make a commitment to change for the better for outside help to have any chance of improving things.

                We have theroaring fire in the woodstove, but the only turkey are the wild ones that wander around our cabin.  Although my birthday is close to Thanksgiving, I’ve never cared for turkey – or pumpkin pie! So we’re having ham, and apple pie instead.  Still the same sentiments – immensely thankful for God’s  manifold blessings.

                        I had a giant piece of quiche Lorraine made by a great chef and good French buddy of mine. It had chunks of ham inside and was as good a Thanksgiving meal as I’ve consumed in a long while. Went down beautifully with a bottle of Syrah.
Happy Thanksgiving to you all and many thanks for the wonderfully enlightened articles, Z. And thanks to all of you for the stimulating comment threads. Some have been mind bending.

        We ditch everyone for nearly this whole week and make it my wife and me and the kids. We spend time around the house together, making breakfast and listening to 1930s and 1940s jazz standards. You know, the good, easy stuff. No rush, no cares.Perfecting that overstuffed omelet, snatching fresh blueberries from the bowl before they get dropped into pancake batter, watching the kids sing and dance in the living room.If you aren’t doing it … we slow eat every meal together. No devices allowed. Makes a world of difference in our lives. Thanksgiving has become a week of that experience.Anyway, for all my hootin’ and hollerin’ here… Happy Thanksgiving, zbois.

        Gratitude and thankfulness is not in our nature. It is a design flaw that our Maker deliberately put into us to deal with and overcome. Gratitude and thankfulness are not mere “social constructs” or an “invention” or whatever the degenerate fake intellectuals want to write it off as in order to dismiss it.It is, however, a key cornerstone in the foundation of the Christian faith. It is one of the tools we have been given to improve ourselves, create serenity and peace for ourselves, and maybe give to others as a show of our gratitude – and give them a chance to be thankful too. Gratitude allows you to empower yourself and others around you. But as you note, this is not possible for many people in our world today.Apparently the lesser folk among us are planning a boycott of Thanksgiving as a show of rebuke for the last election, and those of us that hold the wrong opinions and ideas and vote the wrong way. Like everything else, cherished holidays and gatherings have been reduced to political weapons for them. For them, soullessness is a virtue, and they are not able to see the cost and misery that such a condition entails.We must do the same, unfortunately. But, we can weaponize things too – in a Godly manner. If there are missing faces at your table because of this nonsense – give thanks for their loss in the last election, give thanks for their absence, and pray for their redemption and repentance. And be sure to love the ones that DO show up, and take pains to show it.To all you Yanks – I hope you al eat too much and curse the weigh scale in the morning, I hope you drink enough for a mild hangover, and that your kids remember you and this day with fondness.Cheers!!!Filthie

You say:
To be blessed with a life of struggle, to have a reason to be better each day, is the greatest gift of all.

        Happy Thanksgiving to our host and all here, whose thoughts I read almost every day. I don’t often comment, but I was thinking about the story of the Spartan Paedaretus not being selected as one of the Three Hundred and going home quite glad, knowing that there were 300 better men than him in Sparta. Just so, I am thankful that there are so many better commenters than I here. Cheers to all!

        Happy Thanksgiving to Z-man and the commenter community from this ex-pat.  The United States may not have exported Thanksgiving, but, oh Lord, has it exported Black Friday.  I’ve been traveling from France to Croatia and there are week-long Black Friday sales.  Not sure what to make of it, since I’ll wager that 95% of Europeans don’t know the origin of the term Black Friday.

        We stand on the shoulders of our forebears, who arrived in this country with little-to-nothing and encountered the blessing of true natural hardship. We are descended from the survivors of that gauntlet and now thereby possess those genetic traits that enable us to persists against long odds. And I am genuinely grateful for that gift of resilience and robustness which both sustains me and obligates my actions in defense of my heritage and future generations. And I am grateful that I can and will make a tangible difference when the time is right and the clarion calls. Thanks to all for your wisdom and fellowship.

        A people who built a great civilization out of nothing have a lot to be thankful for, so having a long holiday to take our time and be grateful makes a lot of sense.”I was traveling through rural western Canada a long time ago, and watched an hour of Canadian television in hotel. There was show on, relating the experiences of their early western settlers, building civilization where there was nothing. They had brought metal tools, nails, seeds, and supplies enough to last them until they could instill a white pattern up on the land, to extract calories to feed their children when the supplies inevitably ran out.They had a ritual, which is why I remember this after so long, where the men drank cups of water heated over open fire, as if they were coffee, but there was no coffee, for that was a luxury for which there was no space in the wagons. It was a ritual of pretending, a ritual of a promise of better times. “We will build, and one day, we or maybe it will be our children, will be able to drink coffee instead of pretending with water.”We build and impose our patterns upon chaos. The Jew is no more capable of maintaining Europeans than the African.

            blacks get no more good will from me. White civilization fed, clothed, housed, educated, kept them occupied ,  protected them and brought them Christianity. We made them political equals They have shown they are incapable of living as political equals with us. Their bellyaching will never end as long as we live near them. They deserve nothing from us but a boat ride home.

        I like the weeklong national holiday idea. I drove by Big Lots and they had lawn signs everywhere proclaiming they are open on Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving everyone.

        A Happy Thanksgiving to Z and the excellent commentariat at this site!
Thanks to the timezone difference, it’s a joy to begin each day with coffee, a fresh Z essay, and a huge scroll down of commentary with all the attendant joys of learning new things and just occasionally the opportunity for sperging out majorly when some reprobate is WRONG. My cup runneth over and I am most grateful.

        The annual Berkeley religious ceremony was performed as a result of specific instructions given by the London Company to do so,it was almost two years before the Massachusetts celebration, which was a one time event based upon the recommendation of Plymouth Colony Governor William Bradford and was not held because of any official proclamation from England. They held several Thanksgiving’s after that, but not on a regular basis. Massachusetts didn’t even publish a proclamation ordaining such a thanksgiving observance until 1633, 12 years after their first celebration. The Massachusetts event was a harvest feast with their Native American friends, whereas the Berkeley event was strictly religious.https://berkeleyplantation.com/first-thanksgiving/

        Ah, but Christmas has all themusic. When comparing Christmas to Thanksgiving, remember the thrill of being a little tot and waking up as early as 4:30 to start the Christmas unwrapping. The excitement was palpable.
Tis true, Thanksgiving has the turkey and the oh-so-delicious stuffing, but on Christmas you can eat whatever you damn well please.
Granted, also, that the bonds of family are more quietly proven on Thanksgiving, without the need to pay for it. But can any holiday compare with Christmas for its vast open empty “holiday-ness” feel? I rest my case.
