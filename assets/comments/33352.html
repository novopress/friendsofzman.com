        This was the lesson of the 19th century when Italians packed into ghettos became a society within a society. It turned out that even in 19th century America, assimilation is not automatic. The more alien the population, the more difficult it is to assimilate them.One thing that helped with assimilation was intermarriage. When an Irish girl married a Polish boy, or a Lithuanian boy married an Italian girl (examples from my life and extended family) the rigid walls between Germans/Poles/Irish/Italians/etc. broke down and in a generation or two children and adults were ‚Äúmutts‚Äù: ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm half German and Italian on my mother‚Äôs side, and I‚Äôm Polish and Irish on my father‚Äôs side . . . ‚ÄùSexy Time Uber Alles! ü§£Of course it helped that the children of such offspring came out a constant skin tone.Now? Frankly I‚Äôm stunned JD Vance has an Indian wife. Pretty much EVERY Indian I‚Äôve met over my 30+ years in IT has an Indian spouse. Date outside of Indians? Sure, if you want to be disowned. Now it‚Äôs certainly possible it can happen (Ex 1, JD Vance) but probable? Not so much from what I‚Äôve seen. Feel free to school me in the comments.And other immigrant groups police their interactions with ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù and ‚ÄúKeep it within the walls‚Äù. Think any Muslims in Dearborn or Hamtramck, MI are going to marry a white Catholic? So as you point out that‚Äôs another reason these people won‚Äôt assimilate. Not the biggest of course, but one of them.

            I think immigration should be restricted to marrying natives. Treat the country as a giant extended family. How do you join a family? You marry into it

                I agree. This should be the extent of immigration, besides the O-1. This used to be how most people emigrated or ‚Äúswitched sides‚Äù. Marriage is serious and important while ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to leave homeland X and be a nobody in country Y‚Äù is deeply retarded.

                    A lot of old diversity came from soldiers marrying women where they were based or won wars around the world, once the enemy became the ‚Äòreligion of peace‚Äô that old custom died.

                In partial agreement. Were it up to me, there would benonaturalized citizenship; no, not even if they marry a native. But their child ‚Äî probably ‚Äî should be a citizen. With the usual exceptions (e.g. born overseas to two American parents) nobody is a citizen unless born in the USAandone parent is a native-born citizen. As long as I‚Äôm on my soapbox I may as well ask for the moon. I‚Äôd further restrict non-citizens from having most of the rights a full citizen does. Even under current law, an alien may be denied rights a citizen takes for granted, like the ability to vote, to work without restriction, and so forth. I‚Äôd greatly expand that list. For example, I cannot think of any eventuality under which a non-citizen, even a permanent resident, has any business owning a firearm. Even if you‚Äôre just visiting on a tourist visa you‚Äôd damned well better have proof of sufficient funds, onward ticket, perhaps temporary health insurance, and everything else in order or your ass is getting back on to the plane back where you just came from.¬†Aliens here going through the proper channels certainly deservesomelegal rights, although precisely which would be up for debate. Finally, at the lowest rung, if you entered the country illegally and especially if you‚Äôre a criminal, I‚Äôd say you have absolutely no rights at all and you are handed over to the military unit in charge of border security.

                        Unless I misunderstood the original comment I was replying to, the foreigners here would be the source, like White women marrying Indian men.  Instead of trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the Indians (or any other non-white group) with White blood, how about they just stay in India with their Indian brethren.
We‚Äôre one of the smallest racial groups in the world.  Indians are one of the biggest.

                    Mudsharks are going to happen regardless, since American whites and blacks marry. But very few people marry internationally. The interracial couples are the products of second-generation immigrants, normally.

                    Sadly, this is thesecondthing that came to mind. The first was that, in the age of the internet, 10,000 websites will appear within a week promising ‚ÄúFind romance (and citizenship) in the former United States. Just fill out this simple form and your credit card information and click ‚ÄòMake me a whore for America!&#x27;‚Äù. The third thing that came to mind was all the sleazy lawyers who would pop up offering quick cheap divorces. And with just two clicks of a mouse the US has yet another foreigner WITH FULL CITIZENSHIP demanding a job, an EBT card, free health care, and of course a voter registration card as a Democrat.

                This has been my stance for a while now.  Marriage immigration requires the financial support of a native, thus it doesn‚Äôt tax the natives. It results in only a trickle of newcomers (chain migration via marriage has to be nearly impossible).  And it adds a small bit of variance to gene pool.

                    Nice story.  Thank you for sharing.  You would like (if you don‚Äôt already know about) Mary Taylor Simeti‚Äôs ‚ÄúOn Persephone‚Äôs Island.‚Äù  It is about the experiences of an American lady who marries a Sicilian guy and settles in Sicily in the 1960‚Äôs.  It is a great introduction to Sicilian culture and traditions.  Then there is also Lampedusa‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Leopard,‚Äù both the novel and the movie.  But then my Italian grandmother from Genoa considered Southern Italians, including Sicilians, the same as the Chinese consider the Philippines.

The unions offered him an uninterrupted flow of workers who‚Äôd show up, sober.
His Service Department men would come into the workers‚Äô apartments (which Ford had built to attract them) and rummage through the wife‚Äôs underwear drawer looking for that hidden bottle of Scotch.
T‚Äôain‚Äôt always the management which is the problem.

                            Well, we tried Slavs, and got unions (and some Prohibition) from it.
I don‚Äôt think Slavs have ever managed to equal the level of alcoholic dysfunction that the English working classes achieved.

                        I am American, but  lived in Naples for four years, before university up north.   I recall a trip to Val d‚ÄôAosta with some American friends and speaking to locals who asked where we were from.  I responded ‚ÄúNapoli‚Äù and got back ‚ÄúMi dispiace‚Äù (I‚Äôm sorry)   I get it and I remember the jokes about a match between Napoli and Palermo being the national championship of Tunisia  (how quaint!) but there is very much to admire and be proud of in Southern Italy.Every day I lived there I was surrounded by monuments erected by ancient Greeks and Romans and Medieval and Renaissance Italians‚Äì and the people are great (assholes and great people are everywhere).     I was just a young American living among people much more rooted in their history, culture and religion than I had ever  been in my own ‚Äî and I was surrounded by pieces of my own heritage passed down by a common Western Civilization.  Who am I even without the Greek, Roman and Christian civilization formed there?  I still marvel that I could walk in five minutes to the cave of the Cumaean Sibyl and drove each day though a Roman arch, past Lake Avernus, look out to Cape Misenus, Capri and Mount Vesuvius, see the dock where St. Paul got off the boat on his way to Rome, drive past the local coliseum and Sophia Loren‚Äôs childhood home to get to work.   I‚Äôm supposed to look down on that place and those people?    We are well pass the time when we can afford to fight between North and South Italians, between Europeans, between Whites.  Appreciate what each local people and place bring to the table and defend it all  because they are our kin, our people, and we lose our roots if we lose Europe.

Sure, this happened a long time ago and is impossible to unwind now and they are largely assimilated anyway.  It would have been better had none of the Southern and Eastern European immigration waves had never happened.
Ethnic differences are often as big as racial differences.  Italy and Germany share a border.  But look at the difference.

            That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm against assimilation. It just means interracial marriage. Which means Americans get erased.It wasn‚Äôt a big deal when the population was 7 Englishmen, 2 Germans, and 1 Lithuanian. In fact, in a homogenous country with a strong national identity, assimilation and intermarriage is a good thing for the dominant group.Today, with 4 whites, 3 Mexicans, 2 blacks, and 1 Indian, that‚Äôs just Brazil. Disaster.There‚Äôs nothing wrong with cutting your losses and adopting a new model when the old one fails. America doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúmelting pot‚Äù or ‚Äúnation of immigrants‚Äù in the 21st century.

                America doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúmelting pot‚Äù ‚Ä¶I consider the ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äô I was born into a rotting corpse stinking in a ditch. Africans, Latinx, and dot-Indians are fighting to see who gets to rape the white corpse and International Jews are trying hard to monetize that grisly competition to their advantage, with homegrown Americans like Mitt Romney, Mike Lee, and Lyndsey Graham maneuvering to be of some use to one of the factions destroying their own people as long as they can get some personal profit out of their treason.Whatever American polity arises on a portion of the soil of the old ‚ÄòUnited States‚Äô needs to have a different label. That label can have ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äô in it, but it needs to be different to underscore the break in continuity from the past.All is not doom and gloom, however. üôÇ Pres. Trump has not even been sworn in yet and systemic delegitimization seems to be accelerating. Collapse was the cure yesterday, is today, and will still be tomorrow. It‚Äôs not what anyone should want, but like chemotherapy for terminal cancer, it is what we need to survive.

                I have become more and more uncomfortable with the comparison of the future USA with Brazil. I think it is a category error.Brazil has many tones of skin but they have one culture: the Brazilian culture. What culture unites the different ethnic groups living in America, Somalis with Mexicans for example?In addition, what is today‚Äôs American culture? It used to be European, protestant culture, based on American traditions. Now it is Netflix, Walmart and fast food. America is a giant shopping mall and I don‚Äôt say this happily. When I lived in the States, I was amazed about the lack of cultural traditions, in architecture, in food, etc. No other country has this lack of tradition.

                Agreed fully. The upside is assimilation now is impossible. That only can happen when a majority population is in control and demands such a program, which was the case in the past. As things stand now, that‚Äôs not happening and TPTB oppose it for various self-serving reasons. This fortunately will lead to continued and increased segregation, and miscegenation at some point only will happen as a result of cultural enrichment events and the unavailability of abortion. I beat this drum a lot but internal migration is leading to fully white communities, and the Jews who traditionally oppose this movement are becoming marginalized along with the corrupt whores in Congress and governments, who themselves are becoming irrelevant. As I commented earlier, the associated violence has started to spill over into the Clouds, so the diversity spigot may get turned off. Still, people are voting with their feet, which is the only way that matters.

                ‚Äú7 Englishmen, 2 Germans, and 1 Lithuanian‚Äù- marrying within our racial bounds- is the European style of consanguinous cousin marriage.
Hat tip to HBD and the Church banning marriage closer than 4th cousins, while the rapine Turd World reinforces their worst traits and spiteful mutant strains.
We end up reinforced and revivified, while theirs becomes more fiercely insular and insularly fierce. (ps- Blacks marry close kin alot.)

                        Yes, blacks often don‚Äôt know who their fathers are. If some gangbanger drug dealer impregnated eight females in a four-block radius, one of his sons might knock up one of his daughters without ever knowing who she was.
Multiply this effect over 60 years and millions of blacks and you get‚Ä¶what we have now.

The ‚Äúbreeder‚Äù refers to a black male, often a relative, who they are giving the girls to, to impregnate them for additional welfare income. For reasons, he couldn‚Äôt report or say anything. Muslims do this in spades with their unregistered multiple wives.

            Just a limited N= observation‚Ä¶but every Indian/Caucasian marriage I can recall was a highest caste Indian marrying a white. Given the striations in Indian society (seen enough of that crap in IT orgs) they might see that as the best alternative.

                It is rather interesting that Joe Dirt‚Äôs Indian wife has been seemingly staying in the background, maybe of her own volition, both during and after the election and The Great H1B Freakout. I figured the Republicans would be slobbering all over themselves to promote her, and her marriage to JD,at the least, but nothing so far.
Maybe she knew Elon, Vivek and her countrymen were up to something?

                        I would argue that Vivek blew up his entire operation and 90% of the goodwill he built up with one tweet.
I know a lot of people are skeptical about Vance, and with good reason, but in the debate he literally said that the USA was a nation of people, something that gives the rootless cosmopolitans and globalists fits.

                            I‚Äôm not guessing anything, like I said I don‚Äôt know. I would also argue that it doesn‚Äôt matter, or shouldn‚Äôt matter. We are used to power-grabbing, attention-seeking Lady Macbeths in the public domain, people like Clinton, Biden, and Obama, but there is a reason why they are referred to as Lady Macbeths.

                In most cultures, the less melanized you are, the more attractive you are considered. (By most people; obvs. not by progressive leftists who think POC BBWs are picture-worthy.) It‚Äôs unfair for our darker-skinned friends, but nonetheless preferred. There‚Äôs no surprise that the most-bothered ladies on dating apps are white Euros and Northeast Asians. Even blonde boys in the Middle East get bothered, from what I hear.

                        ‚ÄúBlood calls to blood. The high-caste are literally of Aryan descent.‚ÄùThere are no such people as Aryans. There are Europeans with a specific heritage and there the same Europeans trying to avoid it.That a social climber like JD Vance, product of Appalachia, the US military, and single Mom is a step up to a high caste Indian woman should be all the evidence we need that Aryan is a purely academic concept that‚Äôs almost complete trash. Obviously a very low status man is higher on the social org chart somehow than the highest class Indian woman.If you‚Äôd like to be European at least, we can talk. Ideally an ethnicity with a language and history. If we‚Äôre going to talk about some insane theory, the only proof of which is a few syllables, then that‚Äôs how we got to Clown World in the first place. Almost everyone on the planet‚Äôs slang for Mother involves the syllable ‚Äúma‚Äù. (Hint: It appears to be the first syllable infants utter.) I don‚Äôt think somehow I am related to Chinese despite sharing ‚Äúma‚Äù, unless we want to count Adam and Eve.

                    Been to both, natch, but we even have a little Chinatown remnant (two blocks in old downtown) and a couple Hmongtowns here in the CA Central Valley.
As said, they aren‚Äôt known for rioting; for a while, though, local cashiers were certain to be robbed by some meth-janky Asian gangsta wannabe. That is, until the elders cracked down, and hard. You don‚Äôt even see the trashy rice-rocket Toyotas anymore.
And, being Hmong, they put up a statue honoring Vietnam vets by our Federal courthouse!  We do have *some* allies.

            ‚ÄúSo as you point out that‚Äôs another reason these people won‚Äôt assimilate. Not the biggest of course, but one of them.‚ÄùI think it is the biggest one, together with the similarity of cultures. This is why descendants of Hispanic and White couples tend to assimilate. See Nick Fuentes, for example. The mixed heritage combined with the pressure of the majority culture do the job. This is regardless of people claiming ‚ÄúI am an Indian‚Äù like Fauxcahontas, but their culture is American.When I lived in the States, a friend of mine dated an Indian guy in Houston. The Indian guy treated her like a princess because she gave him free sex (well, it was not that free: the guy treated her lavishly and he was happy to do that). A friend of hers (who had had an Indian man as boyfriend too) constantly told her: ‚ÄúLose all hope. Indians only marry Indians‚Äù. She was right. They often send Indian wives from India to the States so they marry their own kind.

                A commenter on long-lost Heartiste spoke to that.  He said you‚Äôll often see a handsome Indian guy with an ugly wife.  (And I do, here in the Sikh stronghold.)He said they take one for the team.  They marry not for love, or for looks, but to have as many Indian offspring and family ties as they can.Later on, they all tell me the endless phone calls and obligations by family and friends are the bane of their existence.  They are in a crushing web of relationships, yet those South Asian immigrants who are isolated here without it, have told me that their seperation is like a giant hole inside, it is physically painful to be apart.  We whites are seen as a cold and lonely people.

                    Good friend of mine was Indian going to professional school but was semi-arranged to marry an Indian girl who worked on Wall Street.  Turns out he deep down was in love with a white girl (but was going to take one for the team as you put it).  However when he found out his Indian fiancee was screwing around with her white boss in nyc, he broke up with her.  The subsequent non-stop harassment he received from hundreds of relatives from both sides of the family (both here and in Delhi) to get back together with the Indian girl drove him to kill himself.  Even though they dated for a time after, the Indian girl ended up ditching her white boss and marrying another Indian

            Right you are.Back about 1993, when I was an undergrad, there was this Indian girl‚Äìher name escapes me‚Äìthat was in a few of my Russian language and area studies classes. Well, one night I drop into this convenience store to snag a pack of smokes. To my surprise, the Indian girl was at the register. So we got to talking and flirting harmlessly (she was fairly cute), and then all of the sudden she got this frightened expression on her face and said she had better get back to work. At that point I glanced back into a corner of the store and saw three Indian men looking us several shades of hell. (I assume they were her brothers.)I got the photo in Technicolor. Never again did I speak to that Indian girl.

                They were just doing their proper job.  Under patriarchy, the girl belongs to her father/brothers and they don‚Äôt look kindly upon her talking it up with men outside the group.
I always like the courtship of Michael and Appolonia from ‚ÄúGodfather.‚Äù  When they went on a date, her WHOLE family was was with them to keep things on the up and up.

                And in a sense, good for them.  I was on the subway in Seoul years ago, talking very casually and harmlessly to a local girl who was about the same age as me. As I started glancing around the car I saw 3 or 4 older Korean men staring a hole in me.  The message was unmistakable, and I didn‚Äôt begrudge them at all.

Years ago I was with my Chinese girlfriend strap-hanging in the aisle between the two parallel rows of facing seats you get on the lower deck of trams in Hong Kong. Something struck me in the leg. I look down and there‚Äôs this little old grey-haired granny wearing the kind of pyjamas that little old Chinese grannies still went marketing in until ‚Ä¶ well they pretty still do that‚Ä¶
Anyway the venerable old bitch had kicked me for wading into the gene pool.

        Anyone else find it realllllllly strange that two ex-military guys committed terrorist attacks on the exact same day?

And one of the guys is a Muslim with an ISIS (read: CIA) flag at the same time a foreign government which shall remain nameless is trying to stir up anti-Muslim animus in the USA the way it did after 9/11/01?Of course it might just be incompetence. The FBI has spent the past 8 years going after Russian phantoms, grannies at protests, anti-abortion activists who stand on a sidewalk, and Catholics.

        Eons ago, writing my honors thesis, ended up reading the entirety of the Congressional Record concerning the 1924 Act.  Back then they were acutely aware of the problems of unchecked immigration.  Particularly the danger posed by leftist &amp; anarchist radicals attempting to flee Europe as the various attempts at communist revolution failed there. Those old white guys weren‚Äôt so dumb back then.

            Those were men who had grown up without even being propagandized by radio. Which was as nothing compared with the propaganda power of tv that began 30 years later. So it follows that they were able to see more clearly.

                I wonder how much therealelite in our society shields their kids from mass culture. In other words, is there a core of men in the elite who have some understanding of racial and cultural reality? They might even think it‚Äôs fine if the rubes and even most of the managerial elite believes in all the woke nonsense while maintaining their own ability to think critically about how bad things are getting andwhy.When I first heard about Musk, for instance, I thought that, especially with his background in SA, he might be secretly quite reality based but simply held back from making public statements that could endanger his success. The recent H1B flap seems to show that, in some respects, he‚Äôs just as much a victim of mass propaganda as any cubicle Karen or soyboy.

                        Also, in South Africa back in the day, Whites interacted with Indians in pretty specific contexts. For example, wait staff and barmen, stewards, etc. Blacks were not permitted to do these jobs. So Musk‚Äôs childhood interactions with them would have been pleasant ‚Äî like the guy on roller skates who brought you your milkshake at the drive-in restaurant (e.g. the much-missed Tropicale at Albert Park in Durban).It‚Äôs well-known that Indians can be extremely pleasant at a surface level when performing a service and the boot is definitely on your foot. Can be less so when they‚Äôre in the superior position, to put it mildly.There were of course some very wealthy Indians in Apartheid South Africa. One of my grandfathers managed a bank and said his wealthiest account holders were Indian sugar cane farmers, merchants, rum distillers, etc. They had been imported as indentured labourers to cut cane and ended up owning a chunk of the sugar trade stack from finance/merchant to farm labour.Jews tend to grab the commanding heights and that‚Äôs one kind of issue, but there are jobs they won‚Äôt / can‚Äôt do. Huge problem with Indians is that they can populate the whole stack from top to bottom thanks to caste system.

        I‚Äôve been seeing more about 2nd and 3rd generation ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù not assimilating lately and I‚Äôm glad that people are finally noticing.I noticed this 10 years ago, living in a ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù area. While many of the actual immigrants were normal (at least outwardly), their suburban raised kids clearly regressed, acting like knockoff African Americans, listening to rap, speaking in ebonics, while also hating white people (while also being obsessed with white women). Keep in mind these are the children of ‚Äúeducated &amp; skilled‚Äù immigrants who grew up in suburban Canada. Not Detroit.Today it‚Äôs even worse, they‚Äôre fueled by hatred of whites 24/7, egged on by the left. They‚Äôre deeply resentful of the West. They often fail at dating (especially white women) which only increases the rage. But feminism is general has been horrible for them. You can see them overthinking in every situation and totally failing to just be normal people in social settings. Almost every non-white male has a full blown porn addiction. They are not mentally well.The longer they live in the West, the LESS assimilated they become, and the WORSE people they become. Even worse, most foreign immigrants today are the same. Everyone is a 2nd generation immigration these days with smartphones and access to Western culture.This is a disaster, and nobody knows what‚Äôs going to happen or has any idea what to do. The arrogant mindset that we previously had (all immigrants WANT to be like us) is 100% incorrect. We are also very culturally weak these days unlike the 1990s. Expect more and more of these attacks by ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù people who despise everything about you, whether it‚Äôs H1B people or Christmas market attackers.

            Wiggerization (let‚Äôs call it) is the assimilation of immigrant children who‚Äôve regressed to their ethnic mean. Indians are especially susceptible because their mean is so low‚Äîlower than black Americans, some of the numbers say. (True numbers would show themmuchlower, I think.) The somewhat smarter southeast Asians, hispanics, Arabs, etc., tend the same way.Immigrant children who aren‚Äôt morons choose theotheranti-whiteness, not from popular/degenerate corporate/criminal culture but from academic/aspirational corporate/criminal culture.The standard JQ guy observation is that Indians are like retarded Jews. It‚Äôs seldom noticed that an East Asian who‚Äôs truly become American has become ahumorlessJew (of stereotype), a kind of hate automaton. Model minoritiesfollow the model. You don‚Äôt really know hate until it‚Äôs shown to you by middle class Korean girl.

            I think a lot of the problem today is that the ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù culture that we would like immigrants to assimilate to has fragmented into a vast number of subcultures. It is also just much less self-assured and more incoherent. There‚Äôs just not much of a culture left to begin with and what remains is garbage ‚Äì hedonism, perversion, feminism, degenerate music and entertainment‚Ä¶ Who would reallywantto dive into such a fetid pool of filth?The reversion of the 2nd generation Muslims to a strict form of Islam is particularly unsurprising. Islam offers everything the West and its feminized ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù does not, stability, answers to the big questions of life and death, clear gender roles, and for the men, the special heroics of Jihad.

            From St. Paul, Detroit and Philly to Houston, I‚Äôve met a butt-ton of alienated American blacks who went Muslim. It‚Äôs strict simplicity, militaristic routine, and patriarchal harems appeals to them.
The Deep South remains Old Testament Christian, as that appeals to their longstanding family roots in that soil, seen in 200 year-old cemetaries there.
Surprisingly, both are about the only way you can get blacks to read, with vigor.

Talk about an understatement.  Country full of classless low-IQ loudmouth violent dummies who only know selfies and the social media.

            Not that we need more, but we have plenty of our own low IQ people.  This is why knives come with sharpness warnings. It‚Äôs why hot coffee comes with burn warnings.  Lawyers share some of the blame, but these lawsuits would not happen without stupid people doing stupid things.
If you ever want to see some fine examples of how the low IQ people live, check out the ‚ÄúJust Rolled In‚Äù channel on youtube.  What is great about it is how mundane and common it is.  You and your children are sharing the roads with these people.

        The oligarchs will not lift a finger until this violence effects them directly. Given recent events, that is very likely to happen. When it does, their propaganda organs will ring the alarm bells incessantly and their Help and Ho‚Äôs in Congress and government will work feverishly to help out their true bosses. You frequently cite what happened in the aftermath of the J.P. Morgan bombing at the turn of the 20th century and that is spot on. Not all squeaking wheels get the grease but certain ones do.

            True, Jack‚Ä¶ but I wonder‚Ä¶? I am toying with a theory that seems to suggest no real clean up can begin until the women of our nation are fully on board. I am beginning to suspect that they are the demographic that is foisting this misery upon us while us men stand aside and let them do it.
Our Esteemed Blog Host has made rude jokes about repealing the 19th Amendment and I think that he is actually onto something with that.

                    Some of the older women can help avoid the social deterioration, but speaking as one, we‚Äôre at loss to help when the men don‚Äôt care about social standards. (See chaperoning discussion above.)What feminism brought Western men was freedom from all sorts of boring responsibilities, in addition to not even having to worry about marriage. Men don‚Äôt have to step up as leaders. They don‚Äôt have to get that boring job to provide for their family. They don‚Äôt have to deny themselves that toy. The wifey has it covered, if they bother to get married to their partner.Women just need a few years outside the ‚ÄúGood women have a job, recycle, take care of the house, think for their men, can roundhouse a 300lb goon, and will fix the world‚Äù pop culture pressure cooker we live in. The vast majority want the romance and babies and the marriage under normal circumstances.  Women are naturally happier letting the men drive the family car. But the men have to drive the family car.

                            I agree. I have no good solutions other than a roll back to family law that insisted on father/husband rights. And for the guys to at least try in the meantime. I understand if they don‚Äôt volunteer for it.

            I posted a response about this in this thread. There‚Äôs no doubt that the early 20th century elite switched gears very quickly when they saw what was going to happen to them if immigration continued. What I fear is that the propaganda machine is so powerful today that it has blinded even the elite to the problems. I hope I‚Äôm wrong about that. If I am there‚Äôs hope that the Help and Ho‚Äôs will soon get new talking points to push.

        At the RNC, an ethnic and religious conquest of America was symbolically and ritualistically declared and performed. Harmeet Dhillon, dressed up in her native Indian attire performed an opening prayer and declared her God and her people‚Äôs God to be the one true God.That was the bomb that dropped on this country. The only mention of it that I saw was that the Claremonters, supposed Christians and Americans, mentioned it but declared it a net good as the Republicans needed a wide tent.If there is one good thing that I sense afoot, it is that American men, that is to say White men, have fucking had enough to be blunt.I hope that is the case. Yes. The oligarchs have played their games under written by a printing press, dollar senorage, IPO flim flams and a docile and demoralized population.The declared White people the prime enemy. Replacing the bottom of that population isn‚Äôt enough. Now, they ethnically cleanse the military and escalate a pogrom of White men from professional middle and upper middle class life. I still know many White men who are sniveling cowards and/or deeply spiritually sick and traitors to their own people.However, an increasing number of White men are sick to death and are staring at a future where difficult but solvable problems are made impossible. America should be going through a terrible economic convulsion and debt restructuring. Far from a problem that should be a blessing. A nation, an empire a people are forged through difficulty and struggle. We could have gotten through this debt jubilee and come out far stronger, not just economically, but more importantly, culturally and ethnically.We could have had new heros to erect statues to. We could have had new bonds with our folk, our country and our local patrimony since we would have had to pull together and shared and sacrificed together. Instead we get bug men who want to build bartender robots and finish the immasculation of men by making their cars driverless. On and on it goes. To do all of that pointless building with even more borrowed money the American ethnos and people will need to be fully dissolved.So sayeth a man who ran from South Africa to escape sacrifice and shared struggle. Moved to Canada and then landed in America to grift and scrape and ultimately complete the circle by turning his back on yet another nation of Westernkind.Yes. The oligarchs have played with fire. I suspect that the time window for them to take their favorite wall-kissing, beanie-wearing-ass-licking knee-bending pop-psychologist‚Äôs advice and make their bed. They shat in the nest for decades and invited in new ally‚Äôs whose homelands think nothing of open sewage.They have created a tinderbox. Right now, all signs are that they are extremely smug, self righteous, self absorbed in digging far too deep below Moria to wake up. What is most important is that the White men who are sick to fucking death of dispossession and abuse speak with calm authority a consistent and persistent and resounding, ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù The oligarchs better listen.

I have to imagine his unfortunate hairline wasn‚Äôt helping her satisfaction with marital life, so maybe Matt thought he needed to impress her in other ways‚Ä¶
The fact that the body of the Cybertruck is mostly intact could be due to its design, or maybe Matt didn‚Äôt receive good demo training during his time in the Army.

            The Vegas bomber was supposedly a special ops guy with nearly 20 years experience.

                The current internet rumor on Vegas guy is that his Army MOS was 18Z.
Assuming that is true and the 18Z standard training curriculum I found was accurate, then Vegas guy did not get specific, high-quality demolition and explosives training.
Looking at the photos released so far, I don‚Äôt see a bright spark in Vegas guy‚Äôs eye.
Yes, that is an awful lot of assumption on my part.

        This is one of the problems with immigration that the Romans understood, but our current oligarchs do not understand
I‚Äôm reminded that the Romans also maintained a practice of literally farming out retired legionaries to individual plots of land in the far-off edges of the Empire, presumably to prevent them from causing trouble in the Roman heartland in addition to rewarding their service.

            For most of the Empire, the Romans were very calculating about how they settled barbarians. The barbarian lands would get legions posted there, who would often settle there permanently. The males would be brought into the legions and sent off to other parts of the empire. The excess population would be sprinkled around the empire to avoid creating alien ghettos.
The Romans were pretty smart about most things.

                The Romans called these veterans colonies. There are some very cool YouTube videos on this topic. The Romans were very intelligent. They used these to provide veterans with land. At the same time, these veterans colonized and consolidated gains throughout the empire. The veterans, were a net benefit to the colonies ‚Äì providing law enforcement; legal administration; engineering prowess and generally being excellent cultural ambassadors.It is quite the opposite of the global slop house this degenerate regime does.The Romans were brilliant. We are lucky that when the Western empire fell, it was a racial reinvigoration of more pure and highly spirited Aryans that poured over the alps. This empire is rhyming, but this time there are no highly virile and spirited German tribesman who were new Aeneas‚Äôs pouring over as a re-invigoration.The clock is ticking on Western man. Anyway, yes. The Veterans Colonies of Rome are something our genius empire builders can‚Äôt even get right at home much less abroad.

            Yes, but even with the Romans, at some point, the barbarians became too much and they were able to establish their own communities where they didn‚Äôt even have to or want to assimilate into the Empire. Even if the people who took it over in the end like Odoacer did. It‚Äôs not unlike Sundar Pichai or Satya Nadella putting on a suit, speaking English, and emulating Steve Jobs in their presentations.It‚Äôs one thing to take a bunch of Italians off the boat and send them to the middle of Ohio, like Dean Martin‚Äôs family. We figured that out pretty quick even if we ended up with lots of problems from it, which the 1924 immigration act attemprted to address. It‚Äôs another to take in infinity indians and tell them to go live and work amongst themselves, and emulate their home country, and it‚Äôs a good thing if you don‚Äôt want to be American, because Americans are awful, stupid people, and you donn‚Äôt even really need to speak the language or adopt American customs.

        The money line: ‚ÄúCultural diversity needs to be treated like communism was treated in the 1950‚Äôs.‚ÄùI would only add,a fortiori. Communism, a species of Leftism, was a sickness in American society. Joe McCarthey and some other anti-communist hard-liners recognized this and attempted to extirpate the disease. Ultimately, these realists were villified, Leftism was allowed to go its merry way, and here we are, America dead and western civilization tottering on the edge of the abyss.It is almost certainly too late to do what should have been done circa 1952. Nevertheless, the white remnant that retains a lucid mind can hoist in the lessons of McCarthey and postmodernity, reform white homelands, and then treat Leftism and its exponents as the mortal enemies they most certainly are. To hell with what they call tolerance, and to the lower depths with their accursed diversity.

            The problem you have there is that ths whitest areas are the most left leaning, whereas people who live in the diverse areas tend to be more pragmatic.

                What you say is certainly true of the toniest, whitest suburbs. However, I very much get the sense that a significant percentage of whites in the plains and mountain West states are beginning to draw the correct conclusions about diversity and the need for white chauvinism. Obviously, Californication is a serious problem (viz Colorado), but get away from urban zones such as Denver and college towns like Boulder, and you‚Äôll find plenty of based whites. Billings and Berkeley have nothing in common except being in the West.

That, or they‚Äôre just too proud to admit they‚Äôve been fools, there being no fool like an old one.But everyone else eventually comes around to the view that it involves cowardice, connivance, containment, or simple cashflow.  This might not be fair, but can you blame them?All could be cleared up by simple words spoken plainly and repeatedly as needed.

                That was my first thought too.  Lithium batteries can get quite explody.  They off gas an explosive gas when in thermal runaway. If it is in a confined space it can make a pretty big boom.  I personally cannot wait until we have hundreds of underground car parking lots filled with EVs, preferably charging there as well.  The 4th of July will come practically every day.

        My default belief is that any non-obviously populist terror attacks like Mangione‚Äôs (a real attack) is coordinated and sponsored by the FBI. That‚Äôs just a default and I‚Äôm open to being wrong on any specific attack depending on the details. You know, it‚Äôs funny, way back in the day I believed in the hyped up Islamic terror wave. Then Trump was elected and literally all of it stopped, like a switch was pulled or a button pressed. Could this be a shot across the bow that the switch has been pushed back?On New Years Day to see both this Tesla Cybertruck attack (with the truck rented out on the Turo app) and the New Orleans attack (with the truck rented out also on the Turo app) is a strange coincidence. For the latter to be blamed on ISIS makes it not a perfect shoe-in for our elite‚Äôs desire for war with Iran, but then again, that didn‚Äôt stop Bush from invading Iraq and protecting Saudi even though Saddam had nothing to do with Al Qaeda. Or perhaps the motivation is simply to try to remind the world how ‚Äúbad‚Äù the Islamic world is and take the attention further off what Israel is doing in Gaza and Syria, where there is an enforced media blackout after the 1/6 false flag backfired in the eyes of the world. This seems to ring as more likely‚Ä¶Per Sundance back in 2022 on this point: ‚ÄúThe FBI was fully aware of the Boston Marathon bombers, the Tsarnaev brothers, before they executed their plot.¬†The FBI took no action.¬†The FBI knew about the San Bernardino terrorists, specifically Tasfeen Malik, and were monitoring her communications before her and Syed Farook executed their attack killing 14 people and leaving 22 others seriously injured.¬†The FBI took no action.¬†The FBI knew Colorado grocery store shooter Ahmad Alissa before he executed his attack.¬†The FBI took no action.The FBI knew in advance of the Pulse Nightclub shooter (Omar Mateen) and were tipped off by the local sheriff. The FBI knew in advance of the San Bernardino Terrorists (Tashfeen Malik). The FBI knew in advance of the Boston Marathon Bombers (the Tsarnaev brothers) tipped off by Russians.¬†The FBI knew in advance of the Parkland High School shooter (Nikolas Cruz). The FBI knew in advance of the Fort Hood shooter (Nidal Hasan), and the FBI knew in advance of Colorado grocery store shooter Ahmad al-Aliwi Alissa.¬†The FBI took no action. Consider the case of the first recorded ISIS attack on U.S. soil in Garland, Texas in 2015.¬†The FBI not only knew the shooters n advance, the FBI took the shooters to the venue and were standing only a few yards away when [they] opened fire.¬†Yes, you read that correctly ‚Äì the FBI took the terrorists to the event and then watched it unfold.¬†‚ÄúAn FBI trainer suggested in an interview with ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù that, had the attack been bigger, the agency‚Äôs numerous ties to the shooter would have led to a congressional investigation.‚ÄùRemember, shortly before the 2018 mid-term election, when Ceasar Syoc ‚Äì a man living in his van ‚Äì was caught sending ‚Äúenergetic material that can become combustible when subjected to heat or friction‚Äù, or what FBI Director Christopher Wray called ‚Äúnot hoax devices‚Äú?¬†Remember how sketchy everything about that was, including the child-like perpetrator telling a judge later than he was trying to walk back his guilty plea because he was tricked into signing a confession for a crime he did not create. Or more recently, the goofball plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer that involved 18 suspects, twelve of them actually working for the FBI as the plot was hatched?¬†And we cannot forget the January 6th. DC protest turned insurrection effort, which is clearly looking like an FBI inspired and coordinated effort. Have we forgotten the Atlanta ‚ÄúOlympic Park Bombing‚Äù, and the FBI intentionally setting up transparently innocent, Richard Jewel? Then, there‚Äôs the entirety of the FBI conduct in ‚ÄúSpygate‚Äù, the demonstrably evident FBI operation to conduct political surveillance against Donald Trump using their investigative authorities; and the downstream consequences of a massive institutional effort to cover up one of the biggest justice department scandals in history‚Ä¶‚Äù

            Even Mangione is suspect to me. The thing I can‚Äôt get over is how perfectly in the frame of the surveillance camera the shooting was. I know there are lots of surveillance cameras in NYC. But still. Then consider that in conjunction with all the incriminating stuff he still had with him at McDonald‚Äôs a few days later. That‚Äôs at least two good data points for someone like me who suspects fakery.

        To fix it means being realistic about the human condition.
This is a big ask in 2025.  When you cannot accept that men don‚Äôt have periods, how the hell are you supposed to know differences in different populations?
I have read that the managerial class in Wiemar Germany simply took off their liberal democracy hats and put on their NSDAP hats in 1933 and did the same in 1945 when democracy came back.  In many cases, the literal same people.  So I suppose if it is forced on them, they can make the switch.

            I hadn‚Äôt considered that. But yes, quite a few of our darkies have converted to that faith. Wiki says ‚ÄúAfrican-American Muslims constitute 20% of the total U.S. Muslim population. Despite this,2%of Black Americans are Muslim‚Äù. That‚Äôd be just under 1 million Black &amp; Muslim in US. At a glance, I found no info for how many converted, how many are [children of] immigrant Mohammedan, etc. Anyway, after that interesting demographic exercise, another point:Islam is incompatible with anything resembling ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù civilization; see world history dating back to 8th century for details.Problem: our nation guarantees freedom of religion which, alas, includes those whose beliefs are hostile to most other creeds.

        Since the Livelsberger thing is a more obvious suicide (as opposed to Jabbar who was a death-by-cop suicide), I would bet we‚Äôll find out he left a note behind.  It will be interesting to see which way that one breaks.  Given the state of the DIE military, it‚Äôs quite possible he was a hard-core Leftist DIE woke nutsack.  But it‚Äôs also possible he was fed up about the H1B mess.  And that Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúf your face‚Äù attacks combined with mental instability and probably a divorce/family collapse pushed him over the edge.In any case, it seems like the relative calm of the post-election period is over and we can expect more of this as Trump gets close to inauguration.  Most of the weapons of our enemies in the country have been neutered.  And so they‚Äôve turned to straight-up terrorism.  Ironically, it is attacks like this which will accelerate public calls for immigration moratoriums and full-scale deportations.  Most of the mass deportation statements are about ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù, but continued attacks are going to convince a skeptical public that the only solution is to kick everyone out whatever it takes.And the military is going to have to be ordered to start kicking out the DIE diversity candidates and start turning the vice on minorities to drive them out of the military.  It‚Äôs a well-known problem in the military (and the government writ large) hat minorities can simply file EEO types of complaints and that gets them off the hook from whatever crime or misdeed they‚Äôve committed.  It has become a default HR strategy for minorities facing termination or other disciplinary action for misconduct.

        Look around the world to see which countries have the immigrantabsimilation. The US and the UK lead the pack in the Anglosphere. The French and the Germans have their own versions of death wish. Former colonizers, or just fans of guest workers, each has its problems.The Hungarians represent a voice of reason and resistance to Western idiocy. They dare to retain their culture and to secure their borders. For that audacity, they earned a feature on 60CIAMinutes where they were vilified for protecting their own.Eastern Europeans have experience with social controls from the Cold War days, and memories that live on in subsequent generations. The countries up top have policy makers wanting to deny history and human nature. That has not been going well for them. Fortunes change so hope is coming with a new leader in the US, and the UK, France and Germany await regime shake-ups, too.

        ‚ÄòThings like diversity and openness are luxury goods that can be indulged in easy times, but the easy times are over, so these leisure habits must be replaced with realism.‚ÄôDiversity, equality, sexism, racism . . . these are tenets of a faith, of a religion, of a large percentage of U.S. citizens and of the ruling State. The religion will not disappear with tough times. With catastrophe? Perhaps.‚Äò. . . many refuse to assimilate on principle.This is one of the problems with immigration that the Romans understood, but our current oligarchs do not understand‚ÄôOh, they understand.‚ÄòOn the other hand, we have a culture war against the native white population, specifically white men. It is as if the ruling class is trying to create the perfect conditions for terrorism.‚ÄôThe CIA has specifically been about that, for decades, at home and abroad. Careful division of the citizenry into warring tribes, with the Ebil White Male as scapegoat.The EWMs happen to be the creative and productive segment of the population, so ensuring constant conflict certainly is promotion of domestic instability and terrorism. This is to say nothing of other domestic ‚Äòunexplained‚Äô mass-shooting incidents connected with D.C. agencies.Do not homeland instability and terrorism further the interests of the U.S. Security State, grown into bestial proportions since 9/11?

        We used to have the ‚Äútriple melting pot,‚Äù as described in Will Herberg‚Äôs ‚ÄúProtestant, Catholic, Jew.‚Äù Immigrants would keep their religion, and marry those of other groups within that religion, but otherwise become Americans in culture. The second generation born here would be completely Americanized. Of course, almost all were Europeans, with some Catholics and Eastern Orthodox from the Middle East.

        The continental United States is up for grabs, just as it was in the age of the explorers when France, England, and Spain contested for the territory. In their place we have India, China and the drug cartels warring for the same territory.
The natives ‚Äì then as now ‚Äì are not consulted. The old America divided itself into a thousand tribes, and the conquerors exploited their mutual hatreds. Like AINO now.

        Suggesting the FBI should interdict terrorists misses the point. Both Butler, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were by all appearances inside operations. Past activities of both assassins reveal FBI or CIA connections. Who was running them on their last mission is anyone‚Äôs guess, but I somehow doubt it was Mossad (or Iran!). The Butler operation could also not have occurred without at least the acquiescence of the Secret Service. Crooks had to have help getting his ladder and weaponry past security. Someone might have talked him through the op beforehand, since he would have had to know how tall a ladder to buy (allegedly on the morning of) and the ideal rooftop set-up location (coincidentally unoccupied). The hardest part to explain is why the government snipers who were zeroed in on him from another building didn‚Äôt take him out before he got off his shots since that was their actual purpose for being there. But, no, he clambered about on the roof for up to 30 minutes, while he and the nearby sniper team peered at each other through their scopes. Only after he was interrupted by police officers‚Äîalerted by members of the public‚Äîdid he act. Strange how someone who‚Äôd nonchalantly set up his shot while knowingly under observation by federal agents would be spurred into action when caught out by police. But we‚Äôll never really know.

        Much wisdom in here. If I may elaborate a bit on the great immigration wave of late 19th and early 20th centuries: It wasoverwhelmingly Europeanand Caucasian. Now here comes an extremely important point: Yes, a lot of the newcomers were viewed as an alien culture. Many of them hailed from Eastern Europe and wereCatholicsor, God forbid,Jews!!!Beyond religious beliefs at odds with domestic Protestantism, new, provocative intellectual ideas also arrived, not the least of which was what later came to be called Cultural Marxism and its various cousins like socialism. Now the second critical point: as ‚Äúalien‚Äù as those new arrivals may have seemed to those already here, the fact is that on the average, they had far more in common racially (genetically) and culturally than with the waves of immigrants that have come since from those countries that aren‚Äôt particularly White, nor of Christian/European religious or cultural tradition. And no, coming from a former European colony (usually) shouldn‚Äôt count (unless you yourself are of European ancestry, both racially and culturally).¬†To use two examples from the UK: If your name was Richard Dawkins (born in Kenya) you‚Äôve integrated fairly well into the mother country. Or how about Kemi Badenoch? Not quite a household name here, but a woman of some note in England as she‚Äôs leader of the Conservatives. She‚Äôs a no-shit anchor baby of Nigerian ancestry, born in 1980 just before Britain abolished birthright citizenship. (I‚Äôll have to give them a hand for that; too bad we‚Äôve been too stupid to do the same‚Ä¶)¬†The analogy isn‚Äôt perfect, but imagine either Mike Johnson or John Thune being a child of immigrant Negroid. I must give Ms. Badenoch some benefit of the doubt; it‚Äôs quite possible she‚Äôs an exemplar human being. But she‚Äôll never, ever be racially ‚ÄúBritish‚Äù.OK, I belabored the points too much. Suffice to say that anyone coming from a highly alien culture or race is probably not going to assimilate very well, even if both parents were well-educated and employed and attended ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù church back in the shithole country they managed to escape from. I realize it‚Äôs not black and white; there‚Äôs degrees of assimilation and NAXALT. Nevertheless, it is with good reason that in many cultures the newcomer, the stranger, is viewed with distrust.

        Assimilation of immigrants into a new population is akin to intellectual warfare, though it is never framed as such. A battle is going on for the hearts üíì and minds of the newcomers. The newcomer who resists assimilation is committing a kind of treason, whereby the host welcome is shunted aside in favor of guest selfishness. If there is a category of offense for hate crime, there equally ought to be a special crime for failure to assimilate.
