        I almost never laugh out loud when reading, but this did it for me:
‚ÄúThe Washington press corps is full of hysterical females, convinced Trump will stuff their uterus with Bibles and sew their legs shut.‚Äù

            I cackled like a loon over that one too. Our esteemed blog host RUINED music for me when he presented Girl Science, introduced by that Cindy Lauper tune. Every time I hear it I laugh or chuckle with thoughts of sexually disturbed xirls putting on pompous airs of intellectualism. I wanted to go see that Black Panther movie ‚Äì but Z ruined that too with comparisons between Wakanda and Lagos On The Chesapeake. üôÇ The ability to laugh is one of the most formidable dissident weapons and ol‚Äô Z wields it like a sabre.Might disagree a bit, though: Stretch Pelosi might be a little to old and dry to stuff her full of Bibles‚Ä¶ but she‚Äôs a loon too. The only reason she survives is nobody has ever had the guts to take her into the boards the same way they would with a male political candidate. Trump has dispensed with old world chivalry and grabbed her by her leathery old tit and twisted it more than once ‚Äì I can see him easily goading her into doing something stupid. The woman certainly isn‚Äôt that bright.Sure, it‚Äôs political theatre‚Ä¶ but I will happily fill up on popcorn and bad acting whilst I wait for the shooting to start.

            The unchecked hordes of rampaging, toxic waste whores, should have their vaginas sewed shut. Ironically, the aloha snack-bars got that right.

                I am totally unable to see what effect sewing shut the vaginas of the ‚Äúunchecked hordes of rampaging, toxic waste whores‚Äù would have. I wasn‚Äôt aware that most of them liked men enough to allow their vaginas to be used for their traditional purpose.

        I mean the key problem here is this people actually are insane. They know nothing except propaganda and are completely absorbed into their cult. And since we live in a unusually abundant World that is no way reflects how the majority of humans have lived for most of our existence reality is not going to smack them in the face unless there‚Äôs a total collapse. That‚Äôs what I think anyway. I‚Äôm not much fun at parties

            I echo the sentiment you‚Äôve expressed to myself about a dozen times a day. When I say it to others, I usually get them pretty pissed off. But I keep at it, anyway. I don‚Äôt get invited to parties, either.
But they‚Äôll all be invited to ours in a few years.

I am from the mountains of East Tennessee. I was forced to move to Florida to take care of my mother and I only rarely get to go home for a bit. Sad.
When the civil war comes again, the natives of Appalachia will hold the mountains against anything short of all out nuclear destruction.

                            Mark ‚Äì good on you for taking care of family ‚Äì that comes first.  Love east TN ‚Ä¶ I agree Appalachia is a great place to be.  This is my land and these are my people so I can say this:  I‚Äôm concerned that the combination of meth and fractured families are taking their toll on our native population.  Our land is defensible (just look at the Chechens), but we need more men like our grandfathers and the hardscrabble Scots that bore them.  A few years of hard times and we‚Äôll have them back ‚Äì survival is in our gene.

                How much, down payment, etc?(No specifics, please, but affordable range?  Accessible?)
If I put a down, could crowdfunding create a prepper day camp?  An ad hoc dissident college, like adult classes or night school?
Drop by, relax for a few, learn some necessary skills?  ‚ÄúWith fly fishing!‚Äù

                    It‚Äôs 80+ acres with a house that adds a lot to the price tag ‚Äì about $800K.  About 90 mins to nearest big city/airport.  However, most land in my area can be had for $3-4K/acre.  I live on a creek with good fishing, and a spring-fed pond stocked with bluegills and smallmouth bass.  One of the reasons I landed here was the abundance of fresh water.  (Although it sucks to be a landlocked sailor far from salt water!)Your thoughts are spot-on.  I think everyone stuck in progressive regions needs to have a get-out-of-dodge camp.  The challenge with this though is that you need to actually live on the land to develop the skills needed for resiliency.  I really like your idea of a dissident college.  I actually toyed with the idea of a Homestead Academy ‚Ä¶ until I met a handful of wannabe‚Äôs that really didn‚Äôt want to leave their 72-degree non-sweat comfort zone.  This homesteading stuff isn‚Äôt for sissies.  But man is it good living.

                        I‚Äôm looking to depart the urban bluetropolis for a setting like that. Don‚Äôt have the $800k, probably closer to $80k.Like the idea of MT and ID maybe SC but also TN or KY. Just need more research and perhaps some momentum toward economics that would survive the move.Would hate to settle only to be imprisoned again by the city politik like here in CO.I‚Äôve grown quite tired of living in the soulless, atomized, rootless consumer zones. My neighbors here would turn me over to the Stasi for a slice of toast, with avocado of course.These cities are all about building ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù out of every little activity because they destroyed the real one.

            Whitney.There‚Äôs a word for that (maybe there‚Äôs an app for that, too):  decadence.As the late great Jacques Barzun said:  ‚ÄúDecadence isn‚Äôt merely a value judgment; it‚Äôs an actual condition.‚ÄùAnd it‚Äôs caused by the very things you mention:  ‚Äúan unusually abundant world that in no way reflects how the majority of humans have lived for most of our existence‚ÄùWhen you think about it‚Äôs been a recurring problem going back to when we abandoned hunting-gathering for the abundance of agriculture. Reality eventually catches up with all decadent societies. It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see reality catch up to a post-agricultural ‚Äì ie. industrial ‚Äì society.

            The Democrat attack dogs are off leash and want their masters seat at the table. For the Democrat establishment it‚Äôs a classic case of playing with fire and getting burned. You can only get so much use out of useful idiots before they wise up. The Soviets were smart enough to get rid of those people before before they became a problem. Their gulags were full of disenchanted zealots. The Democrats running the same kind of game don‚Äôt have that luxury. AOC, Antifa, the alphabet people and other loons in the party think it‚Äôs their turn to run everything. Pelosi knows these people aren‚Äôt qualified for anything except trouble-making. Trump knows this as well and agitates the hell out of them forcing Pelosi to do things she knows will damage the party. Impeaching Trump will just open unpleasant cans of worms from the Obama era that the Democrat leadership will have to deal with, not the useful idiots.

                Hoover had Hale Boggs‚Äô plane disappear about a year after Boggs went after the FBI on the House floor. Gerry Ford and Nixon went around telling people Boggs was on booze and pills, and froze him out of House leadership meetings, even though he was part of it.
He was on the Warren Commission, hated Hoover, was tired of having his every word captured by FBI bugs, and decided to take them on. He was dispensed with.
They can‚Äôt get rid of us all, though, which is the only hope left.

                Maybe, but there was at least the potential ‚Äì however remote ‚Äì that a hostile administration could come in and clear house.Once the Dems gain the presidency forever, the FBI, the intelligence agencies, etc., will be staffed with POC and true believer whites and they will be promoted based on carrying out the anti-white agenda. There will be zero fear of retaliation and many rewards for coming after us.Right now, we mostly face Google, Facebook, etc. In the future, we‚Äôll face the FBI, the IRS, the ATF, etc., as well Google, Facebook, the banks and the credit card companies. It will be open season on dissenting whites.We need to build groups while we still can.

The endless attack on Western Civ and the acceleration of these attacks during the past decade should have resulted in millions of men up in arms.  Yet most seem oblivious or disinterested.

All of this has become too obvious‚Ä¶yet most of our brethren do,say and most likely think nothing at all about the current state of things and where we are headed.Maybe the atomization and decay have gone beyond the point that makes it seem to many‚Ä¶not worth the effort.

And if they‚Äôre on Facebook you don‚Äôt want to have any part of it.  You have to network your way in through a solid friendship, and you have to prove yourself valuable to the group (i.e. skills &amp; tools) and that you‚Äôre willing to put skin in the game.  If you‚Äôre not finding the groups then you‚Äôve got the wrong circle of friends.  Go to your nearest VFW, but a few rounds, and LISTEN ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll find a group.

            The only limiting force of FBI corruption and leftoid agitation is their obsessive compulsive power struggle with the CIA and its domestic tentacles.Thanks to the dept of homeland security and national intelligence consolidation for the ‚Äòwar on terror‚Äô, the FBI-CIA axis of overt-covert power is completely untethered to maneuver across our dotted lines of fiat borders and jurisdictions to press their will.Toss in the private ‚Äòmuh free market‚Äô surveillance and propaganda partners of the google/amazon/facebook properties and the run silent run deep ‚Äòfinancial crimes‚Äô powers of the DOJ and the noose of the cabal is around our necks already.Sibling rivalry, Trump‚Äôs disruptive fits, and the straight up retarded crazies in the Dem camp are the only things holding them back from finishing the tomes of ‚ÄòWho we are‚Äô, past, present, and future.The left out kicked their coverage.

        Impeachment proceedings for Trump (while the great steaming pile of evidence points at Biden) is a natural outgrowth of the criminalization of politics.
After Texas and Florida are lost, our enemies will use the tools of government ever more boldly to destroy us‚Äìwhile making noise about how they are following the law.  Right now they find using corporate proxies more convenient.  Just wait until every pro-Legacy American group is outlawed in black letter law and speaking in support of Legacy Americans is legislated to be sedition.

Matters not.So all it takes is the badwhite card, played in advance, and the entire goodwhite useful idiot cohort will strangle their own, those few who are brave enough to stand up to degeneracy and corruption in their own community.Clown world indeed. The occupation is real.

                    The right wing needs to get better ‚Äì a LOT better , at subversion.My wife has had some involvement with community theatre. Most of them operate right on the edge of financial viability.  If they‚Äôre holding some sort of drag show ‚Äì it‚Äôs highly likely that there‚Äôs some people within the group running that theatre who WANT that show to be held because they want to sashay on stage and throw their gayness in everybody‚Äôs faces.But financially speaking ‚Äì they‚Äôre still going to depend on $$ coming in from the normies to keep that whole operation in business.So the key is to get the normies to stop going ‚Äì PERMANENTLY.SInce it‚Äôs obvious that there‚Äôs got to be some gays in that theater  ‚Äì find out who they are ‚Äì and get rumours started about them.  Kiddie diddling would be a good one.  Be smart about it.  Do you have kids of your own?  Well then get your kids to spread the rumor.  Kids talk about everything ‚Äì so the rumor will spread like wildfire.My wife‚Äôs brothers were altar boys in one of the churches where one of the prominent Catholic priests were diddling the kids.  None of the adults knew what was going on ‚Äì but ALL of the kids (the boys at least) ‚Äì knew exactly what was happening.  Basically what happened was only the stupid kids ended up getting diddled.You want to bury the local community theater?   Get your kids to spread kiddie diddling rumours.  It will leak up to the adults sooner or later.  Be smart about it.  Even if nobody outright protests them ‚Äì people will stop going.  There‚Äôs likely not enough SJW money floating around to keep that theatre in the black once all the normie money leaves.

            They‚Äôll try, don‚Äôt forget if the Dems get that power the first thing they will do is begin implementing the Green New Deal and totally crater the economy and markets in the process.That will set off a shit storm they and their army of boozed  up soccer moms and soy boys can‚Äôt contain.  Think food and energy riots. And the states will go nuts as their pension funds(which are dependent on the stock market) shrivel up to nothing.And if they are stupid enough to declare war on whitey, just wait as the power grid goes down and stays for the blue hives.

                I don‚Äôt know if the Democrats would really try to implement the Green New Deal. A lot of it‚Äôs impossible. All power through renewable and zero-emission energy sources: not going to happen for the foreseeable future. Just passing a law does not change reality. Also, they probably won‚Äôt destroy the economy once they are in charge. They complained incessantly about drone strikes and other general warmongering in the Middle East. Until Obama. Then they were cool with it.

                    Federalist, it is all about the grift and what they can skim off the top for themselves, once they get in power.  They will employ the elements of the Green Nude Eel that offer the biggest skim.  The rest of their actual governance will be dictated by two things, maximizing the opportunities for grift and the keeping of political power.  Nothing else matters to them.   As for us deplorables, we will be collectively scapegoated, but individually arrested and disappeared, as our profiles identify us as threats to either of those goals.

                    One might think so, Federalist‚Äîbut that assumes you are dealing with rational folks, not ideologues.  In Germany for example, they have a new word, energiearmut, meaning energy poor.  Yep, they raised the cost of electricity by eliminating coal, and nuclear power so much that the bottom quintile of the population can not afford to heat their houses in winter.  One also notes that electrical resistance heating is the most inefficient way to heat a house as well.Here where I live in the desert, a commodity in limited supply is water.  Rates are raised every single year to encourage conservation (and raise revenue as well).  This year, they were forced to concede that the poorest folk no longer could paid for water, the rates being so high and the households in account default rising.Not to fear, they raised the rates even higher and decided that a new program be started that basically provides the poorest folk with 55 gallons of water per day, free‚Äîthe new rates I pay being a de facto subsidy to their now bankrupt poorest residents.Of course, 55 gallons per day for a family of four is ridiculously small.  Not to fear, they are advising folk that they can wash cloths one day and take showers on the other.  No kidding, true.  And of course, homes in the poorer sections of town are now little for than large shacks surrounded by blowing dirt.Never underestimate what ideologues are capable of.

            Observe, analyze, predict, and prepare. First the tyrants must seize power, then they must recruit their jackboot  corps (usually by corrupting existing LEO organizations), then comes arrests and detention camps, then ruthless suppression of any rebellion (real or imagined), and finally grinding repression to tamp down any rekindling of the spirit of freedom.

            You‚Äôre exactly right.  ‚ÄúHow can you overcome that?‚Äù  I believe we have to cede territory.  While I‚Äôm no GOP supporter, one step is to relocate away from blue states and counties.  We need more of us owning tracts of productive land, and fewer of us on suburban 1/4 acre lots.  We need to have non-municipal sources of water, and non-supermarket sources for food, and the means to defend it.  We need to establish untraceable black markets.  We need to homeschool our children.  Speaking of which, we need to have children ‚Äì lots of them.  Lots of things we can do peacefully while there‚Äôs still peace.

        It‚Äôs not just Pelosi and the Democrats who are running scared. The whole corrupt DC Deep State fraternity is on edge. Party affiliation is a contrived illusion used to fool voters into thinking there is an adversarial dichotomy keeping balance in the nation‚Äôs capitol, but the reality is that government is a living thing and it exists for it‚Äôs own ends. It‚Äôs survival is it‚Äôs highest imperative and when it gets desperate, it is both ruthless and murderous. There will be false flag operations. Be careful and do not fall victim to the next Ruby Ridge or Waco debacle.

            ‚ÄúThe whole corrupt DC Deep State fraternity is on edge.‚Äù  Do you really think so?  My sense is that they feel firmly in control.  It appears reckless on the surface but these people are 1) not dummies, and 2) sophisticated sociopaths.  The Deep State has the Democrats back, the Carnival-Barker-in-Chief has his red-to-the-roots people enthralled, the Romney/French faction are on their side, and they seem uber-confident in continuing Obama‚Äôs transformation of America.  Looks to me like the Progressive/Globalist coalition KNOWS they‚Äôre going to win; for them it‚Äôs all a matter of timing.  I agree that false flag ops &amp; disinformation are ongoing, but my sense is that they‚Äôre playing proactive offense, not reactive defense.

        This entire scenario is very much like the shenanigans the elites pulled during the Roman Republic. Get the public all fired up about some incident or corruption and then hold a debate in the senate. Send out your agents to whip up emotions. Wait for public sentiment to build, then put a senator on trial to placate public fury. Plus √ßa change‚Ä¶Democracies are public relations circuses where one side attempts to lure the other side into insulting ‚Äúthe people‚Äù by exposing high-handed behavior. In this case, it appears to be a pretty cut-and-dried case of bribery and extortion on the part of the Bidens. In other words, business as usual in D.C. Unlike prior GOP leadership, Trump is having none of it. Hence, the hysteria.

        ‚ÄúOf course, all of this is great political theater and that is the point of it.‚Äù  Impeachment proceedings will suck the little remaining oxygen out of the room.  The things that matter, the things that are potentially destabilizing ‚Ä¶ well, Barr‚Äôs sitting on a lot of it, then there‚Äôs proxy wars and saber rattling w/ Iran, cascading consequences of crumbling empire, etc.  Rarely do I meet someone who‚Äôs unsettled enough to do more than wring their hands over the big-picture stuff.  Eating popcorn in the theater is entertaining;  forging community and preparing for civil unrest isn‚Äôt.Another thing for those old enough to remember ‚Äì Watergate.  As politically charged as Congress may have been, when you watch the grainy videos those guys come across as intelligent.  Contrast the Democrats of 1974 w/ Pelosi &amp; Co ‚Ä¶ the devolution of the US is readily apparent.  Another lesson-learned is that the only people who end up in jail are the underlings like G Gordon Liddy.

            I twice met a very old, retired CEO of a world-famous brand who was a personal friend of Nixon.As gracious and down to earth as could be, this high pajundrum was a regular joe, as good a joe as you get.During an Indiana snowstorm, the roads were closed, so State Senator Nixon and Pat ended up sharing a room at the small motel where our CEO and his wife were staying.  Both couples were in their own cars, and that‚Äôs how things were done in the old days.The couples became fast friends.  Nixon loved high school basketball; this led to high scandal.Once in office, President Nixon demanded that our CEO‚Äôs nephew call him from the payphone at the school, immediately after every Friday night game, to tell him how the game went.Of course, the kid got in trouble by the principal for goofing around and trying to use the phone‚Äì especially after making up some silly story about direct orders from the White House.The next day, two Secret Service agents were in the principal‚Äôs office, letting him know in no uncertain terms that the kid was allowed to use the phone.Nixon was a good President and a great patriot who ended the Vietnam money machine and got railroaded for it.He and our CEO are like Johnny Carson‚Äì they just don‚Äôt make ‚Äôem like that anymore.

                You‚Äôre right ‚Ä¶ actually I DO find this lifestyle entertaining.  I used to bust my ass in the political arena, look back over my shoulder after a couple years of fighting the good fight, only to realize that my lasting contributions were few &amp; far between.  Working a homestead and forging community is bust-ass work too, but at the end of it the woodshed is stocked, the fences repaired, hay is in the barn, and the root cellar is full of canned goods, sweet potatoes, and winter squash.  Winter is coming ‚Äì time to sight in the rifles and get to reloading.  Meanwhile the boys are growing into men, the girls into capable women.  Entertainment by the sweat of the brow ‚Ä¶ lost my ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù title but gained sanity.

        Impeachment or no impeachment, election or no election, the Dems have already won.  Either way, all the Jews have to do is sit and wait.  Whitey will be finished off through the automatic grinding of the gears which the Jews have already put in place: endless debt slavery, infinity immigrants, miscegenation, the impossibility of White family formation, the total banishment of Christianity from the public square, infinity talk about Islam instead,  and the complete desolation of public culture and public discourse.The other night I tried watching television, both network and cable.  Judging from TV, apparently everyone in America is black.  Or more accurately, all the men in America are black.  If you see a rare White man in a TV commercial, he is either very old, or else clearly gay, or else a sniveling incompetent weakling.  The Jews are prepping their battle space.  They are conditioning you to accept an America without White people.The impeachment issue is just the latest chew-toy they have thrown to Trump, in order to distract him from being President.  Trump will continue to do nothing as president, except bluster and tweet.  They are simply running down the clock on his presidency, and should he win in 2020, they will simply run out the clock for another four years while infinity Latino paupers slither across the border, infinity Indians and Chinese pack their suitcases to come here and take any sort of prestige job away from an actual white American, infinity negroes rape your daughters, and infinity young White people drown in debt, squalor, ludicrous fake culture, drugs and hopelessness.  Whites will continue to watch helplessly as the Jews loot every last shekel from what was once, only even half a single lifetime ago, the strongest, proudest, richest country in history.They have to be laughing amongst themselves, thinking, Who could believe they‚Äôd let us get away with it?  This was MUCH easier than looting Russia twice, easier than Germany, even easier than Europe.

        Second round of wood cutting yesterday and missed the blog. 2 cords in now and 2 more to go.  As Basic Husband and I were driving along the top of the plateau above home between 8,000 and 10,000 ft/elevation gazing at the gorgeous color change into bright yellows and salmon pinks, we heard the news of Disturbingly Ugly Greta and listened to her rage tantrum and cry and point her witch-casting-curse finger at the UN.You of course covered this yesterday‚Ä¶.But‚Ä¶..Folks, what I saw was the beginning of the new action Hitler youth corps. Nothing less. To me, this is a big turning point, for as we die off this creature and her ilk is, in what‚Äôs left of Western civilisation, who will inherit the earth‚Ä¶.at least a part of it.  This ugly,  angry, demented girl‚Ä¶who is being used‚Ä¶manipulated‚Ä¶ and who will be discarded when her usefulness wanes for the next hysteric in the media to rally the Nazi Youth Corp‚Ä¶.. will probably inspire enough young hysterics in the near future to physically attack the Heretic Bad White people.No wonder the world is increasing in Incels.

            Don‚Äôt forget our old adversary, the USSR.  All USSR children were in the All-Union Pioneers or ‚ÄúPioneers‚Äù for short.  Denunciations of parents were encouraged!  Then there were attempts at an American version of this horror, DARE.  Started by Daryl Gates, Police Commissioner of LA, who first militarized the police and gave us SWAT (and many hours of action TV shows as well üòâ ).DARE too had their denunciations, e.g., parents who smoked weed.  Children as young as 8 were encouraged, not just to avoid drugs but to turn in their parents if they were using such.  There are recorded cases of police arrests of both parents as well as horrific threats of mothers losing children if the father did not take the rap for the illicit home drug use.  In other words, ‚Äúwe had to destroy the family to save it‚Äù.I had experience with DARE when my own children were in school.  But I was lucky, my son brought home the materials used in class and I discovered them.  He had been told not to bring them home‚Äînor discuss the class (taught by a volunteer local LEO) with parents!  And that is all you need to really know about this program, isn‚Äôt it?

                No one talks about DARE like that, which is accurate.  My class was the first to go through that when they rolled it out.  Yes, a LEO taught it.  I remember the book being a red paperback.  What DARE taught my class is, which drugs were the uppers, which were the downers, the effect each drug had on you, so that by the time were were in high school listening to Curt Cobain, these same kids, now older, had a better knowledge of which drug they were using, and were curious about using after the DARE program.  The whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use drugs‚Äù theme was lost on day one because it‚Äôs a moral issue that can only be taught by family and religion, not the state.

                Apex, I tend to agree, but not completely.  There must be something beside simple animalistic pain that motivates.  To support this, just go back to 9-11 and the attack on that day. The day after, people were pretty much the same.  No one took food out of their mouths, no one lost a job, life went on, etc.  Yet the military recruitment sites were full with people standing in line to do their part when we went to war.There‚Äôs still something that motivates.  Perhaps it‚Äôs just outdated and fading CivNat patriotism, but it‚Äôs not simply desperation.  We need to find that‚Äîwhat‚Äôs left of it‚Äîand make use of it if possible.

        Whether intentional or not, constantly pressing the hysteria button can be an effective strategy.  Especially if you‚Äôre guilty or want to sow as much chaos as you can to obfuscate your activities. People get tired of the constant hissyfits and tune out. Most can no longer tell the difference between the wheat and the chaff nor do the even care anymore.

        Another possible reason for this theater is that the (supposedly) soon-to-be released IG report on Spygate FISA abuse will be damaging to the Obama administration and the Democrats, the Democrats know it, and they are providing the(ir) media with another story to cover so that the IG story can be ignored.

        Pure supposition follows.Might I be so bold as to suggest that the whistleblower is a Trump plant? In the NY marketplace one of Trump‚Äôs favorite tricks was to leak stuff about himself to Page 6 type reporters to get free advertising. Trump does not call his properties TRUMP just for his name. Every rumor he generated greased his brand.Trump wants to eliminate Biden so that Warren can be the Dim floor mop he cleans the floor with on his way to a second term. But the press ain‚Äôt biting on the corruption. So he turns it on himself where it WILL get traction. The plot is set to be a mirror image of the Biden/Son shenanigans. The whistleblower is loaded and a phone call is made. The Dims bite. That video resurfaces of Biden getting a foreign prosecutor fired. AOC screams cover up by Trump. Trump releases the phone call and the Dims have cream pie face. But now EVERYONE knows that Biden is dirty, exactly what Trump wanted.No its not 4D chess, it is just a man who for 40 years has observed and used the NY media bubble to his own purposes. Well practiced but not necessarily genius, more like guts to take the risks playing their game and winning.

        Pelosi absolutely doesn‚Äôt want to go down the impeachment road, and I‚Äôm sure the big money donors don‚Äôt want it either.  The problem is, she started the machine, sort of like at the end of the movie Total Recall.  The button with the little alien hand on it.  I‚Äôm sure she thinks she can drive this out of control vehicle onto some runaway truck ramp like they have in the Rockies, but living in a bluer than blue place, the liberal Democrats I know have the taste of blood in their mouths.  Trump is driving them crazy.  It‚Äôs one of the few good things about him.  You have to be mentally ill to be a liberal Democrat anyway, but you can‚Äôt just throw porterhouses to Rottweilers and then take try to take the steak from their mouths.This all benefits neo-Victorian schoolmarm Warren of course.

            I think the Democrat leadership is in reactive mode. This is not good for them and they know it. Pelosi has been trying to end the impeachment talk for a year now, but it keeps bubbling up. In part, this is to placate the loons, but it is also a way to get Biden‚Äôs crooked son off the front page. That‚Äôs a big problem for them. Despite his drop in the polls, he still has a commanding lead among blacks.

                They are clearly panicking.  I would love to know what their internal polls are telling them.
Now is the time for Trump to increase the pressure on them and, if possible, the tempo.  Iowa is only sixteen weeks away.
I believe we should be doing everything we can to keep Tulsi in this as long as possible.  She is not only hated by those who hate us, she heightens the internal contradictions within the Enemy‚Äôs camp.  Try to use her against them the way they used McCain against us.

        CTH (Conservative Treehouse) has an interesting take.  From the phone call transcript released today, Trump asked the Ukrainian President for help in access to Crowdstrike, a Google related company with operations there.  Crowdstrike was the company hired to deconstruct the DNC server ‚Äúhack‚Äù (actually the insider breach by the departed Seth Rich).  Crowdstrike‚Äôs report, never finalized, never reviewed by anybody in the U.S. government, was the basis for the whole ‚ÄúPutin helped Trump‚Äù thing.  To try to take Trump out and to also cover for Obama team spying.  Bust open Crowdstrike and you bust the whole Dem narrative.  That makes Joe Biden collateral damage and a diversion, for now, for both sides.  The bad news in all of this is it is likely Trump doesn‚Äôt have the goods on the DNC server (yet) to make the case.  The Ukrainian President better have good bodyguards.

        Z Man;I‚Äôm surprised that nobody has mentioned Dan Bongino‚Äôs theory that some of this insanity is a result of ‚ÄòCanary Traps‚Äô being run on the swamp by Trump Admin loyalists.  And there is evidence for his view.  For example, this well known intel technique is how the US Navy knew Midway was the target of the Kido Butai in the summer of 1942*In general, a Canary Trap is a search for insecurity by floating ‚Äòbelievable‚Äô stories that differ in known, key details past suspected enemy agents or in comms channels suspected to have been compromised to see what surfaces in enemy signal traffic.  In this case, suspected deep state leakers are being exposed to carefully constructed juicy rumors with different details to see which, if any, surfaces in the media.  The chief staffer of the Senate Intel committee was caught leaking to the NYT in this way a year or so ago.In the current environment of foaming mouthed Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) in the swamp these days, it would be ridiculously easy to run this gambit against deep state actors.  Neither target nor media outlet would spend a day going, ‚ÄúHey, wait a minute, this is just too good to be true.  Actual intel is usually ambiguous‚Ä¶‚ÄùBTW, this is an ‚Äòand‚Äô theory, not an ‚Äòor‚Äô theory of the recent insanity.  Why not stoke the madness of the enemy while usefully rooting out hostiles within the admin. at the same time_?  Sun Tzu judo, baby_!_______________________* Navy codebreakers had penetrated the lower level IJN codes but not the top, Admiral‚Äôs Code.  So the knew the IJN was coming but not where.  So they instructed the Midway garrison via secure undersea cable to signal in one of our own insecure lower level codes that they were desperately short of water due to recently added manpower.  Sure enough, IJN monitoring stations reported to Tokyo that AI (?), code word for their target (i.e. Midway), was short of water.  Didn‚Äôt win the Battle of Midway, that depended on brave pilots, but it did allow them to be at the right place at the right time.

            Actually, this Ramzpaul quote suggests that the point is just to keep rolling out the frenzies, one after another, in order to accumulate power and take away people‚Äôs freedoms.
RAMZPAUL on Twitter:
Steps to lose freedom:
1. Amplify and exaggerate an issue to create hysteria.
2. Show women and children crying.
3. Claim that any person dissenting from position hates women and children.
4. Push through legislation stripping away liberty.
5. Forget original issue.

        What else can they do for the 2020 election? When you have the slate of candidates they do, your only option is to make noise about impeachment without actually doing it and reaping that particular whirlwind. The only thing worse than losing to Trump like Hillary did is losing to him in a landslide.

            Have to wonder if they‚Äôve just written 2020 off‚Ä¶Warren seems the only one of the ‚Äúmajors‚Äù that has put pen to paper‚Äîbut items like ‚Äúwealth tax‚Äù are patently silly.  Remember the AMT?  Great idea, base your entire funding plan on extracting tribute from the one demographic best equipped to dodge and litigate your tax.  Most guys I talk to in my finance world see this as a set up for an ‚Äúexcess funding‚Äù tax on 401ks.  The Dems goal may be to just clear out the pipes of all the old farts and start fresh in 2024, hoping for a recession and/or a war along the way.

        Biden is finished as a candidate. This investigation will force the media to cover his complicity in his son‚Äôs corruption in the Ukraine and his role in forcing Ukraine to fire the prosecutor investigating his son as a condition of receiving US foreign aid. They can‚Äôt sweep this under the rug anymore.I‚Äôm still stubbornly sticking with my Harris as the dark horse theory. Biden will withdraw before South Carolina. The black support for Biden in South Carolina will go to Harris, not to Warren or Grampa Simpson. Harris will have a ‚Äúsuprisingly strong‚Äù finish in South Carolina, which will revive media interest in her campaign. She will win California, thereby locking down the nomination.

            I‚Äôm not sure. The media has memed the shit out kamaltoe with no impact. Blacks instinctively know she is a fake, a half Jamaican and half Indian Canadian without even the vaguest connection with the black experience. I‚Äôm more authetically in touch with basketball americans as a anglo saxon, at least I lived with them during periods of my life. Even as a fake, Obama shot hoops and talked a good game. Kamla adds inauthenticity with the personality of a wet blanket.Who does that leave us? Warren reminds them of the white wamen principal that scolds their kids. Bernie appeals purely to upper middle class whites and student loan holding soy boys. Buttplug and Corey are homos. I‚Äôm having a real problem figuring out where they go. But they are almost certain to be depressed and discouraged by having a group of white catladies and homos leading their banner in Nov 2020.

                I‚Äôve always had a suspicion that Warren, with her ‚Äútax wealth, not income‚Äù proposal (which by the way is right on if you want to take the super rich folk down a peg) might turn off the needed big donor support.  On the other hand, that conclusion sort of involves a belief in the political system which in this case seems to be falling prey to the Gell-Mann effect.  üòâ

                We also might be getting past the point where analyzing future elections through the prism of rationality ‚Äî or rational voters ‚Äî won‚Äôt get us even close to the outcome. The more the Benighted of the Earth flee in over the borders, the heavier those vote totals for the Blue Army swell. You might be looking at a near-solid majority of idiots (I.Q.-wise) being sufficient to outweigh the voters who‚Äôll make a semi-informed choice between A and B, permanently. And this latter group is still going to split down the middle, more or less, between D and R.We all know it‚Äôs coming, that‚Äôs the terrifying thing. We know the numbers in the late 2020s already ‚Äî it‚Äôs only the temporary presence of the upper half of the Baby Boomers that‚Äôs keeping us from really seeing the shift in the landscape. Not the kind of thing one likes to spend a lot of time imagining, I understand.For now, we can still talk about elections as if they matter (in the broadest sense possible). But soon, they won‚Äôt. That blue swell is coming ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a lot more than just a color. Board up the windows, I guess.

        Personally, the continuation of Trump derangement syndrome by the idiot left has left me imagining torture and violent death for all those involved in pushing this nonsense. It would be highly enjoyable to see Trump shove it all down their throats as Biden Pelosi Nadler and Schiff among others have it shoved up their somewhere else. Idiots like these need to be culled from the herd. I like the idea of banishment after a good caning. Liberia could work. The reality is there will be no justice.

        Contra our Host, I figure Trump is in real, deep trouble.Thing is our elites don‚Äôt care about public opinion, or elections. The canceling of Brexit by first cross party treason, and secondly their Supreme Court, heralds the way. A dirty deal to impeach and CONVICT Trump is already in the works. Drudge is filled with it, Romney is rounding up Senators as we speak. Most of the Republican Party HATES Trump and figures if they can just get rid of him they can go back to being the Washington Generals to the Democrats Harlem Globetrotters, to borrow our hosts phrasing. Romney needs 13 Squishes to get rid of Trump. He‚Äôs highly likely to get them. Promises will be made, cross party switches induced, and voila Trump is gone and say hello to Interim President Pence. The Senate and House may even decide to appoint Hillary as this is uncharted waters and the law is whatever John Roberts says it is. See Obamacare.Yes this is a Hillary job. The Whistleblower is represented by one of her lawyers, so it was planned out months in advance. Trump is in deep, deep trouble. Public opinion, the law, none of that will save him. None. Elite maneuvering is all that matters.What Trump should do is get very, very close to his Generals and military contractors (his generals retirement plans). Announce the Iran issue requires a whole lot more of Aircraft carriers, ships, planes, tanks, and more men to man them. With higher pay. The national security state hates him and wants him gone like Cool Wine Moms. The FBI, CIA, other intel agencies want him gone, gone, gone, and launched the whistleblower complaint and asked for a criminal referral to the DOJ.The only counter is a massive military buildup and serious, serious money on the table dependent on Trump. THAT can get his generals and admirals and more importantly their retirement plans (consulting for defense contractors) that Hillary and/or Warren can‚Äôt match. And neither can Soros.Trump need not have ALL Elite support but he must have to avoid conviction SOME elite support. He can point out that there will be no military nor fat defense consulting jobs for generals and admirals under Greta Thunberg. None. They‚Äôll have tend coffee bars for extra money, heck Warren could and would raid their pensions. To fund her green stuff.This is hard ball, low level, down and dirty patronage politics for survival. Democrats have seen how Boris Johnson and Brexit have been canceled. The Labor Party now supports total open borders and any foreigner living there can vote in all elections. Including Parliament and referendums. They only have this as their policy because they know there will be no elections soon; they have a deal with some Conservatives and Liberals to be the next PM. The FT has been warning their readers of this for weeks, listing who would get nationalized and who might not under Labor, and who the new big wigs will be so their corporate leaders can ready the payoff money.Heck we are this close from John Roberts declaring Hillary the President. Which was her plan all along. NEVER underestimate the underhandedness, the dirty dealing, the ferocity, the willingness to employ the worst of things by Hillary Clinton, Lady McBeth.I don‚Äôt think Trump has it in him and he‚Äôs gone by Jan / Feb. I hope I‚Äôm wrong.
