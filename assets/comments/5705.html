        UKer is right.  We have the same system in Canada, and it also leads to what Mark Steyn has called “the nationalization of your body”.  That is, EVERYTHING you do can be claimed to be the state’s business, because they’re footing the bill for your health care.  What you eat (salt? fat? bacon? sausages?), how you spend your leisure time (sedentary activities like reading? watching TV? Risky activities like mountain climbing? wilderness hiking?), are all suitable for nosy bureaucrats to come and boss you about.  And they will.  And if the glow of self-approbation isn’t sufficient because they’re concerned about your health and well-being, it will be bumped higher when they can pose as sober custodians of the people’s money.

        No political system is stable in the long run, and it always collapses into something else. According to Polybius the cycle was democracy to aristocracy to monarchy, with intermediate degenerate forms of ocholocracy, oligarchy and tyranny. We are, apparently, in the ocholocracy stage.

        Here on our side of the pond we have the — allegedly magnificent — National Health Service which consumes a lot of money each year, but in a nation which offers free health tourism (cue many cries of anger from lefties when UKIP dared to say it was a NATIONAL health service, not an INTERNATIONAL health service) spending public money is inevitable. With more and more people arriving here — often from shit-hole countries with piss-poor health provision — the spending has to go up. Yes, they bring their diseases and war wounds with them.As the immigrants don’t pay any taxes at first (if ever) the burden of this cost falls on those already here. More, the government has to provide interpreters to NHS hospitals to help soothe the fevered brow of angry muslim families who insist that there is no way a qualified male doctor will look at the damage their ham-fisted home clitoridectomy has done, loudly insisting only a female doctor can admire their nasty handiwork.But putting aside our new friends and their quaint cultural ways, the result of all this concentration on ‘free’ healthcare is that the government turns more and more to propaganda to cut hospital admissions. Thus we here are bombarded by endless illness -and-injury prevention messages. It might seem that the government cares about what you do (won’t be long before we all must wear crash helmets and body armour when walking to the local store, lest we should trip and fall) but the fact is they want to ban anything that might increase the spend on hospital care.This is one of the things any socialist-loving insistence on single-payer health care in the States will bring you. The government will eagerly want you to be very careful and sensible and timid because there won’t be enough cash to pay for all the foreign-created health issues the system will have to provide for.

        I have been a Colorado resident for almost 20 years–a high income professional who contributes approximately $20,000 to $30,000 per year in income taxes to the State of Colorado, depending upon the year. We have a flat tax rate less than 5% so you can do the math. I will move if this passes.This ballot initiative implements the pure socialization of the state’s health care system. Insurance providers will be eliminated and a replaced with a political subdivision of the State which assumes financial responsibility for health care payments. The system will be financed initially with a 10% payroll tax, 2/3 of which is paid by the employer and 1/3 of which is paid by the employee, and a 10% tax on non-payroll income. Self-employed people pay the entire 10%. The system will be administered by a 21 member elected board which has the authority to raise tax rates at their discretion.This is a ballot proposal to amend the Colorado Constitution, which means it goes directly to the voters. I expect it to pass with a wide margin as it represents a compelling value for the vast majority of income earners in Colorado. The median income in Colorado is approximately $50,000, so a median income employee will pay approximately $1667 per year for himself/herself and all his dependents. There are no deductibles and coverage includes dental and vision. There is no rating for health issues, age, pre-existing conditions, etc. This system is going to bleed money.The inevitable losses incurred are to be recouped by contributions from self-employed schmucks like myself, who will be forced to pay between $40,000 and $60,000 per year into the system. Goodbye, Colorado. I’m going to Phoenix next month to start hunting for neighborhoods, schools, etc. I suspect I won’t be the only high-income earner leaving if/when this beast passes.

        TINVOWOOT!there is no voting our way out of thisin any respectit is what got us here to begin withThere is another aspect of stupid which bears telling. It is the illegitimacy of stupid.As in, (aside from their appetite for other peoples fruit of their labor to feed their greed for free shit), if collectivists are stupid enough to try and disarm us, because that is the next logical step to keep the gravy train rolling, just the fact it is such a incredibly stupid thing to try that alone is enough to make a man shoot the stupid sonofabitches.
