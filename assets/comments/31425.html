        ‚ÄúWhat they are instinctively doing is rallying to the defense of the giant corporation as they have been trained to do by conservatism.‚Äù
They will also staunchly defend Marxist institutions like colleges, as long as you owe those institutions money. ‚ÄúWhen are you going to pay off your loan for your useless degree, snowflake?‚Äù

        Boeing fired 65 people for ‚Äúracism‚Äù in 2021.  I wonder how many they fired for things like, I don‚Äôt know, being bad at welding?

            I think that‚Äôs the reason liberalism can‚Äôt persist in holding power.  The core beliefs in human rights and equality mean that a true liberal has to acknowledge the horde of anklebiters (like say Zman had to address every single comment on his posts personally, impossible)Liberals obviously get around this problem in reality by just replicating the standard ape hierarchy where if a lower ranked ape goes ook at you too much you bite its face off to shut the other chimps up.  Then they slather on a nice thick coat of bullshit over that reality so they can still claim moral superiority.

        As regards this young lady in the video, two remarks: (1) Welcome to Globohomo, babe. What, did you think you hired on at a local hardware store? (2) Thank you for posting this. It exposes Globohomo for the heartless, humanity-destroying machine that it is.

        Don‚Äôt have time to read all the comments to see if anyone has mentioned this yet.  Companies like Cloudfare intentionally over hire for sales positions figuring there will be a wash out rate.  If not enough of the lower performers voluntarily quit in the first few months, they let a few of them go.  If they are going to do this, they should be forced to be up front about it in the hiring process.  It is hard to believe some cockroach trial attorney hasn‚Äôt already taken a run at a company for doing this by now.  Must be too hard for them to prove.

        Question : What are, ontologically speaking,Conservatives, in ontologically leftist countries like the US and GB?Answer : they are the army of those which want to conserve the leftist system. I used to mock the US tradition of calling the left as ‚Äúliberals‚Äù, but I have to apologize : you Anglo-Saxon were right on that topic. Liberalism have its roots on the left. As its cousin, Socialism.‚ÄúClassical Liberalism‚Äù is just the ultra-selfish version of Liberalism, aka, a leftist system.In a materialistic universe, the only alternative of individualism is a monstrously powerful state government.In a Christian universe, like medieval Europe, there was an alternative, which fulfil  the individuality and the community.Community is represented by natural associations, aka families (biological), guildes/corporations (work), village (place), Church (spiritual).welfare, such as free medical care, pension, work accident, etc. wasn‚Äôt provided by the state but by corporations and church (via monasteries).School wasn‚Äôt provided by the government but by the Church.Army wasn‚Äôt centralised but under local control.People, by jury and peers judgement, had a guaranteed not totalitarian justice system (as opposite to justice based on roman/napoleonic system).Economy was extremely reglemented, with protectionnism and high-quality verification of products.Capital was in the hands of the Workers, but with corporate natural hierarchy (apprentices and masters).Advantage was given to the producers, to quality of products, against consumers and quantity.Of course, in the future Christian system, parameters will have to include speed of transport, high level of energy and development of AI, etc.But hierarchy, famuly, Christian God, Church, Corporations, democracy in villages, aristocracy in provinces and monarchy in the state will have to be reestablished.(for those which have abilities to read french, I highly recommend the books published by a now totally forgot catholic journalist (he even haven‚Äôt a Wikipedia page) on google books. He‚Äôs named Jean-Baptiste Victor Coquille. He explained with high knowledge in laws, juridictions system, how great was the Christian civilisation of medieval era.He also saw, IN THE YEARS 1870, what will happen : neopaganism, migration invasion, split between biological blood roots of nations and immigration, extended free-trade, schools as Propaganda machine which would produce millions of ‚Äúpoliticians‚Äù every years, etc.Really, really, extraordinary work.https://www.google.fr/search?hl=fr&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:coquille&amp;tbs=,bkv:f,cdr:1,cd_min:1+janv.+1863,cd_max:31+d%C3%A9c.+1898&amp;num=30

            ‚ÄúOf course, in the future Christian system‚Ä¶‚ÄùMaybe you are thinking about subsaharan Africans in Europe. The indigenous people of western Europe and their diaspora, if we survive at all, will never again be mostly Trinitarian except in isolated, beseiged pockets We‚Äôve crossed too many bridges. Those Christian chapters of our history were substantially completed after textual criticism of the holy scribbles discredited the faith of blood-drinking, cannibaliatic shamans.Trinitarians can‚Äôt even overcome the reasonable objection that the first theologian, JC himself, divided the substance while dying on his cross of assisted suicide. ‚Äúeli, eli‚Äù, cried the first theologian, ‚Äúwhy have you abandoned me?!‚Äù Yes, why was JC abandoned by the god with whom JC is supposed to be one in being? It‚Äôs a fair question, and it reminds us that good theology begins with asking the right questions.Let me present, however, a consolation prize. Muhammadists, who were in a hurry to conquer the world, borrowed the ascension superstition without stopping to think about the motive for writing it. If the Christ were resurrected but still on the Earth, faithful and skeptics alike would demand to know where he is. Simpletons would want to bow down to him idolatrously. Skeptics would want to ask him why he accomished so few of the tasks of moshiach, the Jew‚Äôs nationalist gangster who will, among other deeds, lead a conquest against the nations. Early Trinitarians thought it best to avoid those awkward moments, so they hid the body in the sky, so to speak.Muhammadists, lacking the wisdom of patient men, took up the ascension myth needlessly. Their masih, as they call him, could have lived out his life on Earth as a mortal and died in a regular way. (Though this would lead to another problem, like why call him masih if he‚Äôs not the Jews‚Äô moshiach?) This terrible truth about the alleged ascension‚Äîwhich our scientists have shown to be impossible‚Äîneeds to be exploited to subvert faith in Muhammadism. As that faith declines so wiill the Moe‚Äôs birth rate. It can work the same way with other tunnelites who are having far too many children.Now if you‚Äôre paying attention at all, you can work put for yourself just who would be motivated to destroy the nations whose scholars and scientists pulled the rug out from under their paleonazi plan to subjugate the world and to make theirelves into the master race. If you‚Äôll recall how far advanced the Germans were 100 yrs ago in science, technology, and scribblestudies,, you‚Äôll understand also the special vindictiveness which the wannabe master race has toward the Germans.

        I‚Äôve never considered myself a libertarian but I‚Äôve increasingly become libertarian curious. One of the biggest problems I‚Äôve noticed is how large corporations have become states into themselves and how Americans are increasingly at the whim of a privatized totalitarianism.I had always assumed libertarians were pro corporation and that corporate personhood (think the citizens united case) is there ideal. But over the past few years, I‚Äôve increasingly become of the view that corporations have abolished the right to freedom of association.If Walmart comes to your town and forces most of the family owned business to close, you‚Äôve effectively had your sovereignty taken away. So couldn‚Äôt you make the case from a libertarian standpoint that a community has the right to either force the Walmart out or to the very least have the city government take over the operation of the store?Is this what some libertarians believe? I assume the mises guys would be more likely to agree with this

            There is a faction of ‚Äúleft‚Äù-libertarians who are anti-corporate in the sense of favoring progressive-style corporate regulation‚Äîas every established corporation and oligarch does. They‚Äôre the ones funded by corporations andoligarchs.There‚Äôs also a faction of ‚Äúright‚Äù-libertarians who consider incorporation an injustice as it creates a class of people shielded from normal prosecution/liability, and that special elevated/extra-legal status perverts the market toward fascoid monopoly (etc.). They oppose that kind of ‚Äúlegal fiction‚Äù shield for all (other) agents of the state, too. There are seventeen such libertarians and they‚Äôre on all the gulag lists maintained by corporations.The problem is the standard libertarian conservative who shares with the ‚Äúleft‚Äù above the idea that incorporation is a *necessary* legal fiction, because number go up/progress‚Äîand pretends that corporations aren‚Äôt the architects and drivers of globohomo/clownworld/etc. because why would they do that? That‚Äôs not profit! The government makes them do it!

            kk,Ludwig von Mises, a Jew, wrote a book in German with the title ‚ÄúLiberalismus‚Äù, and in that work, Mises called for a Welt√ºberstaat. . Yes, Welt means world, and Mises wasn‚Äôt daydreaming about something wimpy like the League of Nations, which he critcized. Probably both the German original and an English trans are still available for free in pdf from mises.org.Lew Rockwell, who knew both Mises and Murray Rothbard afaik, claims to be ‚Äúanti-state‚Äù, but he does not advocate abolition of the utterly statist racket of incorporation with ltd liability. Every now and then one of his people takes up the matter only to conclude that rootless irresponsibility capitalism is holy. Make of that double standard what you will, bearing in mind that Rockwell is a papist, too, like Tom Woods, a convert from Protestantism whose work often appears at Rockwell‚Äôs website.Another one to look out for is Walter Block, who specializes in defending the indefensible and who has run in that libertarian circle for more than 50 yrs. I think this guy knew Ayn Rand, author of a notorious book about a capitalist engineer who accelerates civilizational breakdown so that he can get his hands on the distribution networks of bankrupted electric companies. (John Galt invented a gizmo which could generate power at extremely low marginal cost, but he didn‚Äôt need obsolete generation equipment.) Fyi, Rand was a crude materialist with a na√Øve love for the USA, and she hated libertarianism.Back in the 70‚Äôs, Rothbard got mixed up with the Kochtopus, the network of the Koch brothers. Rothbard, Ed Crane, and Charles Koch established Cato Institute, the slippery Beltway outfit which sends out pocket sized editions of the DoI, the AoC&amp;PU, and some imperialist fake law called the Constitution. MR didn‚Äôt last long there, however.Reason Foundation and Reason mag are west coast operations; one or both are now active in an office in DC. When last I checked there was no good explanation from them about why it would be good to set up Capitalism, Inc., if it didn‚Äôt already exist to destroy us. Probably their most famous personality is Nick Gillespie, a former chief editor who likes to wear a black leather jacket.The true purpose of the libertarian factions mentioned in this comment seems to be to steer potential communists into a cul-de-sac where they won‚Äôt be useful to Marxists and similar trash but where they, and others, also won‚Äôt become a threat to Capitalism, Inc., let‚Äôs just say by organizing a revolution to abolish it. If the libertarian follower never has a sharp word for Jewish supremacism, so much the better. One of these factions, as suggested, has its fair share of idolaters who are angry that the shoe of persecution is on the other foot.P.S. Rothbard, another Jew, was a Holocaust skeptic.

        I got laid off at a company once, after 13 years. I had been there since nearly the start and was the guy who implemented and installed the company‚Äôs first-ever product sale. I was laid off by a Chinese grifter, new to the company, who knew nothing about the company‚Äôs products. In fact, he was aggressively ignorant about what went into them. He wanted to reengineer every single thing and was committed to making all the mistakes his predecessors had made and fixed, because he didn‚Äôt care at all about understanding the existing code base.I failed to be the nice, compliant corporate citizen. I tore him and the HR drone new ones. It‚Äôs probably fortunate for all of us I was laid off over the phone ‚Äî I was a remote worker. I burned all the bridges. It was okay, I already had an interview set up for what was to be my next job. I knew it was coming.I‚Äôd figured out a few years before that the company had no intention of honoring its reciprocal obligations. It had made a lot of big promises to early employees at hire time ‚Äî  various perks after so many years of employment, and serially stripped those perks just as they were about to have to honor them.It been sold to Boeing a couple years prior and the executive team, including the HR VP who‚Äôd been there less than a year, filled their pockets with cash and told the rest of us to be happy with the couch change they thew at us. But this manager was extra special. I‚Äôve never hated another human being as much as I hate him. I researched his background. He made all his money from settlements suing the companies that used to employ and contract him. He was an absolute piece of shit. And he hired in new Chinese employees to replace me and others.Postscripts: They called me back a month after laying me off and asked if I could do some work for them. Hahahaha. No way. And the company was out of business within a year after laying me off.

            Vizzini:  I was one of those who used to at least sympathize with the ‚ÄúToughen up, snowflake‚Äù comments.  But I‚Äôve changed my thinking about this, along with so many other things since I began reading Zman and learning from the commenters here.My husband works for a privately-owned company.  Started small.  He wasn‚Äôt one of the earliest employees by far, but the company was still small when he got hired.  The pay was small, too, fwiw.  We went without extras for years; his customers routinely assumed he earned double or triple what he actually did.  While I am obviously partisan, my husband worked very hard and loyally and earned the company many, many multiples of what he was paid annually. (I think the b-school formula is that one ought to expect 10-15% of the profits one generates?  Not even close.)Anyhow ‚Äì company recently stopped, due to general economy and reduced profits, what had for a short time been very generous  bonuses.  Fair enough, but taking past 3 years‚Äô of inflation into account, it‚Äôs akin to taking a 30% paycut to go back to base salary now.  And he/we learned that a few of the top office guys recently spent multiple tens of thousands traveling to one international business conference.No, we didn‚Äôt help found/establish the business.  Yes, we are grateful he has a reliable and now decent-paying job.  But the blatant inequity and lack of concern for those who bring in the profits that pay for those luxury items in lieu of employee bonuses really rankles.  I‚Äôm far from stereotypical ‚Äòsocialism‚Äô but I loathe untrammeld corporate capitalism as practiced in AINO today.

            For me it was a xirlboss who returned from maternity leave and promptly engaged in a power struggle that resulted in me and several others being laid off. I love how even motherhood doesn‚Äôt humanize the modern powerxirl. The power struggle was above my level and not with me or any of us IT people directly. I‚Äôm getting pretty desperate now since that was back in Sept. The IT field is now bloated with all these people that should have never been hired in the first place getting the ax now. I‚Äôm just looking for a normal programming job that pays reasonably well. Actually feel free to leave a message at the headline post in my blog (linked in my sig here) if you know a place that needs a great C++, Java, or Python guy. That goes for all of you guys too! üôÇ

                    As BigJim notes it‚Äôs now always a pajeet. It‚Äôs also true that they seem to make no distinctions among the various technical fields and spam you with all kinds of random shit, everything from tech support to PhD level research science. I‚Äôve tried, on a few occasions, to engage with these people. Even when the job they send me is basically the same thing I‚Äôve been doing they never follow up. This makes me think it‚Äôs all part of some lame effort to game the visa rules. They send their email out to a bunch of people with White guy names and they can check that box and proceed to push their cousin Sanjay forward.They also love to leave voice mails. They often speak in a very strange soft mumble on these. I‚Äôm tempted to call it the Mumbai mumble. In the worst cases, it‚Äôs impossible to understand them at all. I suspect this is part of the game too. Only other Indians are meant to understand them. It makes me angry and sad to be watching this takeover knowing that, like the southern border invasion, no one will do anything to stop it.

                Road signs are not statues or plaques, of course, but they do cost money and they‚Äôre paid for by taxpayers.

                    In addition to which, palm a current quarter and palm a quarter from say, 1965 and feel the difference in weight.Current quarters are nothing more than plastic coated with a thin film of alloy. The quarters of the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs, you feel like you actually have something in your hand, something with a bit of weight. The new ones are hollow, nothing like the beauty of the past. What better way to showcase the lightweights of today.

                    The Sacagawea dollar coin is a thing of absolute beauty.  The finest looking coin ever made in America or possibly anywhere else.The state quarters were a nice touch.  Then the mint lost its mind.  Everything since is just awful.  The presidents dollars were hideously cartoonish.  The national parks quarters were undistinguished scribbles (except for the one with Jefferson‚Äôs Nose.  That had to have been a joke by some smart aleck juvenile).I haven‚Äôt seen these new quarters, but it sounds bad   I don‚Äôt care if they feature some no-accounts as long as they LOOK good.  There is no excuse for ugly currency.

        I guess I will be the contrarian here. Her video smacks deeply of solipsism.  As Tired Citizen noted, all big companies are soulless borgs, and have been for decades. Mass layoffs are part of the game, and you just have to roll with the punches. By the time that call comes in the corporate decision has been made and nothing is going to change it. Somehow, Brittany Pietsch believed Cloudfare should an exception for Brittany Pietsch, because girlpower I guess.Her LinkedIn profile is a portrait of a girl boss wannabe. Of course, she has the pretty girl picture on her profile. Her ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section is a cut and paste of Cloudfare corporate word salad. She received a BA in musicology and ethonomusicology (whatever that is) from Kennesaw State University (whatever that is) in 2018. After stumbling through a couple jobs in the performing arts field she landed a sales job in the IT staffing industry. It appears she switched into software sales in February, 2022. She bills herself as a Midmarket Account Executive, but has less than two years of relevant experience. She is the living embodiment of title inflation and of the corporate bloat that zero percent interest rates drove.It‚Äôs worth spending a few minutes to scroll through the comments in response to her video, which she posted on LinkedIn. It‚Äôs mostly a combination of other girlboss wannabes giving girlpower kudos and corporate drone men simping for the pretty girl. Nobody is telling her the truth, which is that her resume is not going to be 86‚Äôd by HR in any decent-size organization if she doesn‚Äôt take down this stupid video.

                I‚Äôm 100 on board with your take on feminism but I don‚Äôt agree here. Assuming she‚Äôs factually in the right that her evaluations and feedback from here supervisor were all good, it‚Äôs understandable that she feels blindsided and gaslighted by ‚Äúhey, you‚Äôre doing really great. Next day, oh btw you‚Äôre fired‚Äù. Such fake signals are uncomfortable to say the least.Another thing, very common I think, is that she is being fired not by her supervisor or someone who could tell her how her name was picked. But by people she‚Äôs never met or interacted with. And who can‚Äôt answer her questions. That is just a sh*tty way to treat people, common or not, imo

                    I agree. The video exposes a lack of common humanity in the ones entrusted to do the firing. As Z man says, these are mid-management flunkies, who know they may well be on the next list if they don‚Äôt stick to their scripts. This young lady may be a liberal dipshit with no relevant experience, as summarized at length by ‚ÄòGuest‚Äô above. It doesn‚Äôt matter. She was given no coherent reason for her dismissal, by two complete strangers.

            @Guest,@RayYou are not wrong my friend.  Having witnessed countless numbers of corporate layoffs, including one at a well known automobile company, they did the layoffs exactly like this girl boss experienced.  There were women crying, hiding under their desk‚Ä¶. I shit you not.  They had to send security zombies to fetch them.The reality is, while poor Britney is feeling empowered by her video ‚Äì you know ‚Äì by sticking it to the patriarchy, the only thing she changed was that she ensured she will never have a job in corporate America ever again.  She has the wrong color uniform and even her female victimhood is not enough to save her.  It will be business as usual at mega corps.

                I should have clarified in my comment that her ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section  is a corporate word salad almost certainly because she has no idea what it is that Cloudfare‚Äôs products and services actually do. It‚Äôs evident from her background that she is completely unqualified to be in any form of technical sales. She‚Äôs a people person, which is fine, but she is not a tech person.Back in my corporate days when I had to explain technical concepts to people with no technical background I would draw the relevant product/service as a black box labeled FM Converter, which received an incoherent signal and output a coherent signal. Heads would nod in compliant agreement. When the more inquisitive drones would ask what FM stood for I told the F**king Magic. Always got a laugh.

I do not ‚Äòget that‚Äô.  Your women ALREADY have taken over your nation.  And here you are, looking after the interests of the Poor Girl Bosses.
Do I want Girl Bosses in Girl Boss Amerika to be ‚Äòtreated well‚Äô.  NO.
Do I want Girl Bosses, period.  NO.  It is right there in Scripture: women bossing men is rebellion against God.  NO I do NOT want to make their happy little rebellion easier.

                With respect, she does not have to live this way. She has a degree in musicology and ethnomusicology, whatever the hell they are. She would be eminently qualified to teach music, theater, or the like. Or to get married and have babies.Nothing in her educational background qualifies her for a corporate position in technical sales, or even suggests she had any interest in business. She made a deliberate choice to chase the corporate life, presumably for the money, status, and power. Girlboss.In the long run, this might be a blessing for her. Hopefully, she will reflect on whether her corporate career choice is the right situation for her. If not, she‚Äôs still plenty young to change tracks.

        I‚Äôve worked for large corporations my whole career, including a very prominent tech company for a lot of years.  I learned very early on about how things really work.  Right around bonus time, we would be sold a line that we only met ‚Äú80%‚Äù of our goal for the organization, and some other bullshit numbers conjured magically out of thin air.  Our bonuses were then cut to reflect the ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù.  Meanwhile, the executive overseeing the organization got 100% of his bonus.  How does that work?Nowadays, people look at me funny because I have zero investment in my company.  Sure, I work hard and do my best, but everything I do is solely to benefit me.  Every decision I make is to benefit me.  I do not attend any all hands meetings, I do not attend company ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù, I have an email rule that automatically deletes DIE emails and I never attend any off site meetings.  I couldn‚Äôt be more disinterested in how the company is doing.  As long as every two weeks, my check clears.  If that‚Äôs no longer the case, by keeping my skillset sharp I try to be as hirable as possible and I‚Äôll go to another ‚Äúblack worship center‚Äù.The level of incompetence in these executive suites is mind numbing.  I assume everything they say is a lie and it is the correct assumption.The big mistake the young girl made was ever thinking she was working for a company ‚Äúshe could believe in‚Äù.  I nearly spit my water out when she said it.  No such thing exists, especially if you are white and not a trans or gay mutant.  Hopefully she learned something.

        That is a brutal video. The HR word salad was beyond unbelievable. I honestly thought it as an AI firing her by the tone of the voices. The total lack of respect for who that young lady was as a person, let alone an employee, was just incredible.She asked fair and reasonable questions about why she was being let go and they came back with, ‚ÄúThree plus purple equals banana.‚Äù Just incredible.That is so typical for American companies. Hire and fire has always been the name of the game with no consideration for the little guy or how these cold, calculating decisions affect people as human beings.But as we all know, there are lots of people out there who can do these low level pseudo-management job where everyone is a ‚ÄúManager‚Äù or ‚ÄúAssistant Manager‚Äù of  nothing. And if next week the company decided to hire someone to replace her, they will.The real lesson here is that this will continue to happen to young people with little education or who lack professional skills. Or worse, they wasted tens of thousands of dollars for a useless marketing or business degrees from colleges who just print diplomas. It‚Äôs why parents should push their kids into STEM majors or if they are not college material, then at least take up a professional trade.Thank God we have nothing like this kind of HR/worker relationship here in Germany. Yes, companies do go under and people do loose their jobs. But no one get tossed out the door like yesterdays garbage.Keep in mind around 90% of German companies are small, privately held family owned companies who know each and every employee, and often their families too. Unlike giants like Krupps, Siemens or VW, the majority of German companies are not run by invisible management teams who have never even visited the factory and have no idea who works there.

How has it happened that almost all German companies are small and privately held?  My assumption is that, given the drive within capitalism to always expand into giant coorporations, there must be some sort of legal protection for these small companies.  Is that correct?

                I am not sure that necessarily is the natural or predetermined course of capitalism. Japan, to some extent seems to also have avoided the ruthless financialization of the manufacturing sector, albeit with many very large corporations.
Conversely, I think Britain went down the financialization dead end with a vengeance.

                        Why, yes indeed. Remember that she expressed the firmly- held opinion that there was no such thing as ‚Äúsociety‚Äù. And she put this into practice as the female equivalent of ‚ÄúChainsaw Al‚Äù, showing no sympathy for, or perhaps any awareness of, the historical social distortions of British culture that led to the impasse in society to which she fell heir.

                    German manufacturing is in steep decline and can only ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù as a patent feeder for the Chinese.In terms of financialization I don‚Äôt get why peole always ignore the Dutch or the  French. Don‚Äôt assume the Anglos are the worst offenders in this regard.The Hartz 4 reforms in Germany gutted the German Working Class; this was a policy that deliberately impoverished the German worker to out compete the southern Europeans. Government financial chicanery with the same effect as Thatcher‚Äôs reforms.It‚Äôs still the case that the German minimum wage is much lower than that of the UK.There seem to be more Anglo Saxons in France and Germany than in the US or UK.

                It is childishly simply to prevent companies from getting too large. Antitrust is one way. Another way is the tools we used to use backs in the day ‚Äì things like the Interstate Commerce Commission (regulating interstate commerce is literally in the Constitution, guise!)Firms like UPS would have to justify their entry into a new state by making the case for the common good before the ICC. I‚Äôve seen documents from the ‚Äô30s or whenever. They would have to show that current state of shipping in Ohio or wherever was not meeting the needs of the people and that their entry would be a net benefit to all the citizens.

                Because the average German business owner isn‚Äôt a money greedy so-and-so. Germans are about responsibility and hard work. Responsibility to the people who work for them, and working hard to take care of the business. We don‚Äôt live for the here and now, we look down the road for our children.
Of course successful business owners will have a very nice house and  very nice car and take lovely vacations. But everyone who works for him also earns enough to buy a nice home, a nice car and take 30-days of vacation.

                    Karl, this is probably too big a question, but why are the German business owners like this when the white business owners in most other first world countries are not?
Those German business owners, who still feel a sense of community, must face constant temptation and pressure to maximize profits over community.

                        I think the word you are looking for is ‚Äúcontentment‚Äù. These companies and their owners are content with what they have and understand the limits of what they can effectively manage while providing excellent quality products and sustaining a thriving business focused on their employees.
When you stop caring about your employees, they stop caring about the company.
For example, there is a company called  FKT GmbH. You‚Äôve never heard of them but they manufacture the wind guard used in Audi, Mercedes and others. This is typical of the smaller companies that supports much larger industries.

                    There have been at least a few exceptions. I used to watch them at the casino in Monaco, the German bosses with their escorts parking in front of Hotel de Paris. Their money was bet to loss in terms of gambling winnings and call girl pay. They were German company owners who clearly wanted to step outside their predictable lives. But it was the company money that apparently got spent on the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù junkets. I had a ruling citizen as a client, and I was fortunate/unfortunate/tough choice to participate for a time. Power corrupts absolutely.

            ‚ÄúKeep in mind around 90% of German companies are small, privately held family owned companies who know each and every employee, and often their families too.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs still true in America, too. That‚Äôs how the Labor Department keeps coming up with imaginary unemployment numbers by fiddling with the birth/death rate of small companies. The reason the States are in the situation they are is largely the rules are written for and by the big players.You can hang your shingle out, but you can‚Äôt get Tax Increment Financing. You can grow your company into a going concern, but watch your pennies, because unlike the big boys, there will be no bailouts for you. Environmental mitigation of imaginary risks, which costs the big boys a fraction of a percent of revenues, digs deeply into smaller businesses, sometimes a quarter or more. Just plain old litigation destroys small businesses, while it just gives the legal departments at megacorps something to do.

            I truly hope German manufacturers do not devolve into financial firms with manufacturing on the side. This has happened to many American brands that used to be standards of quality. The most famous is no doubt Boeing but Remington and, I think, general electric and general motors as well. Bottom line, or even worse stock, obsession destroy a culture of excellence

                I think Germans, and most Europeans, tend to shy away from huge corporate conglomerates. Smaller companies are more flexible and more dynamic and specialized. So even in a down economy like we are experiencing with a decline in automotive production, these small shops can quickly change to something else, or at least support other industries quite rapidly.Historically, German engineers and technicians were separate from Management. Engineers and Technicians hired new employees and trained them themselves, with no interference from Management.Management was responsible for finance, marketing, sales. They were never involved in the day-to-day work of engineering or the trades.Managerial involvement in the technical side is a relatively recent thing. And even then, they approach us carefully. They know they need us, we don‚Äôt need them. And we make a point to politely remind them of it all the time.

In Germany that would be companies like Krupp (Krupp Thyssen today) and Siemens. Every major industrial power has a handful of major industrial conglomerates at the apex of the economy. For various reasons they are needed. In Japan it would be zaibatsus like Mitsubishi and Mitsui. It‚Äôs the USA that now lacks these major industrial outfits as it has allowed parasitic finance to run unchecked and allowed its previous large industrial outfits to bit the dust, or shift offshore, or be raided and made hollow by the likes of Gordon Gekko.

                    This sounds like the very different, and salutary role played by Mittelstand firms play.The US economy is wildly distorted by the very different rules for large, often multinational corporations.Also, the outsized influence of the Military Industrial Complex with its deliberate policy of siting of its branches throughout the country in as many different Congressional districts as possible to force multiply its political support to assure fulfillment of its expectations for support contributes..Lincoln‚Äôs destruction of States‚Äô Rights and Powers, sedulously built upon, coupled with the concomitant gigantism of the Federal government and the ceding of the vast swathes of administrative law to that bureaucracy have been beyond poisonous.

            I used to work for a family-owned newspaper and media conglomerate that had been in business for more than 100 years. It used to periodically mention as a point of pride that it had never laid off an employee in all those years.Near the end of my tenure, they were running out of competent family members to manage the business and started brining in corporate MBA types. One of the first things they did was change the name of our ‚ÄúEmployee and Labor Relations‚Äù department to ‚ÄúHuman Resources.‚ÄùThe layoffs started not long after that. I‚Äôd already seen the writing on the wall and was gone, though.

                It is an interesting history lesson to look back and see how many self made men built massive businesses and fortunes in the late 1800‚Äôs and early 1900‚Äôs. But when they handed the company to their sons, it often failed.This was very true in America and the UK as well. Although the great estates of the UK suffered horribly with the loss of sons during WW1. You should look up the history of Philip Danforth Armour and Gustavus Swift. Both incredibly successful, but only in their time. Massive family fortunes were made, and lost.It may have a lot to do with timing (right person in the right place at the right time) and scale. As I said, the majority of small German family owned and run companies go back 100 years.In fact, The Coatinc Company, Germany‚Äôs oldest family-owned firm, was founded in 1502. We have breweries that are even older. The Bavarian State Brewery of Weihenstephan opened in 1040 and you can still enjoy their beer today.

        Nothing quite so odious than the mega-corporation refrain:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a FAMILY here at Corporation X!‚Äù
I hate it even more than the DEI crap.  If anything, this tiktocker is learning in real time that no, you‚Äôre not ‚Äúfamily‚Äù and never were.  This ‚Äúfamily‚Äù meme is weirdly paternalistic , in every HR manual and most communications, and manifests itself in very weird ways when headcount reductions take place.
Most men would kill for their family.  They‚Äôd die for their family.  They‚Äôd take huge pay cuts and sacrifice a great deal to keep their family afloat.
For their job at mega-corps?

        What Cloudfare did is in no way excusable; but this woman started out strong by calling them on the bullshit then devolved into the snowflaky ‚Äútrauma‚Äù rant. Was that a product of the safe-space-seeking shame tactic so many U.S. college students adopt in the current age? Instead, she should have immediately pivoted to demanding a severance package for an economically induced downsizing. If that was met with similar dismissiveness and faux concern, she should have ended the exit interview immediately thereafter.The reality is that corporate weasels who try to engineer a ‚Äúlack of acceptable performance‚Äù justification are neither going to provide meaningful feedback or a future reference beyond dates of tenure. The whole goal is to avoid any possibility of litigation. Young people, conditioned by social media to share, indeed overshare, need to be mentored to understand that exit interviews are a complete waste of time and never benefit the separating employee.On the up side, I would counsel her that claiming the separation as an economic layoff on her resume is an ethical response that has almost no likelihood of being challenged by Cloudfare if a future recruiter calls to verify her tenure.So, the cringe part of this video is her apparent need for emotional satisfaction resulted in a viral video that completely undermines that resume strategy. She outed herself and will be explaining in future interviews just how competent she was with no one like her direct manager in a position to back that up. As they contemplate the optics of their organization being the subject of a similar negative viral video, they‚Äôll politely thank her for interviewing; round file her application; and she‚Äôll return to her job as a barista living hand to mouth in hopes of once again ascending to the Cloud. She‚Äôs attractive enough; so she‚Äôd be better off marrying a solid guy, having some kids, and embracing the life of a wife, mother and homemaker. I predict that Hell will freeze over first; but I‚Äôd be delighted to be proven wrong.

                I used to think that in these situations, that she should be home raising children.  However, given her girlboss profile posted above by Guest, do we really want her raising American children?  They already have enough going against them.  Imagine the mental castration she would perform on her little boys.   And Girlboss, Jr., would be the scourge ot the IT department, or even better, the ethnomusicality department at some woke junior college.  Not to say the latter wouldn‚Äôt deserve it.

            Maus:  Yes, I would agree that she had no incentive to talk to HR lizards except to request severance.  It appears that her tenure was very short, so unless she could talk her direct supervisor into providing a reference (likely, since they should have done the firing, anyway and may actually feel bad about it), she should just leave the whole thing off her resume and start over.  Making videos of all life‚Äôs unfortunate events is the current fad, but I agree with others here that it will backfire.   Expecting respectful and dignified treatment from a large employer is a thing of the past.  Mutual trust is gone.  Never trust a corporation.  Always have a Plan B, and that‚Äôs from the first week of employment. Even if Plan B is just to stash away money for a rainy day.

        ‚ÄúThis is not without consequences, and we see it in politics. When no one in the managerial elite is ever held accountable, the selection pressure for membership in the elite shifts from aptitude to obsequiousness. You see this in every established corporation and in the government. The people at the top are increasingly incompetent while increasingly obsequious. Politics is packed to the gills with oleaginous grifters because the system selects for such people.‚ÄùBiden is the apotheosis of this: a worthless p.o.s. who never accomplished anything and doesn‚Äôt have enough brainpower to light a 1.5W light bulb. Incidentally, if you want to know how third world sh!tholes are governed, you‚Äôve described them to a T. Mediocrity, committees, servile behavior to the scumbag immediately above you while kicking those beneath you, constant jockeying for position, the paramount importance of optics rather than real performance, and grift and corruption everywhere.At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, there‚Äôs no social contract between those ostensibly governing and marks and rubes like us. The risks and responsibilities have been shoveled on to us, with the rewards to those at the apex. Heads we win, tails you lose.

            I could believe the sanctions on Russia were Biden‚Äôs thing, because who else could have such a combination of stupidity, arrogance, and recklessness. I remember, years ago, an interview he gave, which seems lost to time, in which he expressed the sentiment that an action‚Äôs worth was judged by whether you could ‚Äúyou could get away with it.‚Äù In the context that a heavy handed, unethical, or illegal action was ok if you could get away with it. Felt like it gave me some insight into the man. And I have viewed some of his actions, nord stream, the border, in this light.

            I forgot to add nepotism. Which brings me to the interesting developments in France, where a homosexual has been appointed prime minister, who then appointed his husband as foreign minister. This, coupled with the rumors that Macron himself is homosexual (thinly camouflaged by him marrying his grandmother), mean that France is now a government of homosexuals. This is what Europe has sunk to.

            Reciprocity is my main argument against civic nationalism.  Whites can model a society where no one sees race, but the non-whites are unwilling and often unable, even if they wanted to, to reciprocate this behavior, due to their instinctual ethnocentrism.  It can‚Äôt work without strict punishments for those who try to form racial collectives.

        The worst thing for her is the borg is going to fight back.  Next company considering hiring her is going to take great offense at her uploading the video of her being fired to the internet.When I first went into the full time work world, people were constantly telling me that the world had changed, that companies had no loyalty whatsoever to employees.  It absolutely was true. Corporations want to suck the lifeblood from its employees and then discard them the second they run out of blood to be sucked.  They would love to suck even more blood even faster. They would implement the system called 996, which is what they supposedly use in China. 9AM to 9PM 6 days a week and a worker is considered worn out by 35.

        In the old days, the Elite had to own their screw-ups. Historians estimate that 30% of the Roman Senate perished at the Cannae disaster. The French Elite losses at Agincourt were appalling. The Aristocracy of Europe really suffered in WWI. This ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù is what bound the lower classes to the upper classes.Today, the CEO of Boeing gets on TV and emotes about the MAX debacle like a bitch. They outsource everything so they own all the upside stock-option benefits and then cry on TV when the downside scenario appears. If he had any dignity, he would resign.So we stumble forward, emoting and virtue-signaling, while reason and accountability (pace Jack Nicholson in ‚ÄúAs Good as it Gets‚Äù) are thrown out the window. The final collapse won‚Äôt be followed by a sober autopsy but instead a good crying session with boxed Kendall-Jackson and Ben &amp; Jerry‚Äôs.

            It‚Äôs hard to say exactly when how or where it ended, but the death of noblesse oblige in AINO was no doubt one of the early indicators of its demise. Certainly by the 1960s it had ended.

            I am closely acquainted with the company you mention and at the highest level. The C‚Äôs have visited my home and I theirs.Routine meetings have been all about DIE for years. It is talked to death with religious fervor. Because the C-levels‚Äô comp packages are heavily weighted by DIE, they have no choice in their private views, conveniently. As a consequence, policy is illegally in my view dedicated not to hire or retain straight white males unless there is no option. Outside consultants are used to patch known holes so-to-speak.This is all being driven by the money suppliers who control the board. They are literally micro-managing who gets to do the actual work and in my opinion they will penalize an employee at any level who should happen to hire a straight, white male.It is a blood vendetta like the show in Ukraine except that my demographic is the one targeted for erasure. The demographic imposing DIE knows jack squat about aircraft and spacecraft, if you investigate the history of aviation you do not find the surnames found in other fields, not at the frequency certainly.White guys do spatial reasoning better than any other people, period. We should naturally be employed in aviation design and construction positively disproportionate to our relative numbers. Instead, we are being excluded increasingly,  the opposite direction, which demonstrates the company ‚Äúleadership‚Äù is motivated by concerns other than shareholder profit. Why this isn‚Äôt being litigated in the courts tells you a lot about the money people because they are going to lose a lot of money but proceed with DIE anyway. It evidences their priorities.Forgive me for the rant, it‚Äôs -9F/-30F outside and I‚Äôm cranky.

                    I have a love-hate relationship with our winter. It culls the invaders, ferals and other bipedal beasts residing here in West Lagos. But dang if the wind doesn‚Äôt sting and turn denizens grumpy and even more inclined to murder. Also I can‚Äôt bike the lakefront, which is a thing with me (47 miles U.Chicago and N‚Äôwestern as my pylons).I never followed professional sports although I‚Äôve represented some owners, players and front office types so Go Team. I‚Äôm a U. Mich A^2 alum and follow, somewhat, Meechigan feetsball, hockey and rugby. (I started on the #2-ranked intercollegiate Michigan Rugby team back in the day, yea us.)The ring of honor comedy, our mayor and this state‚Äôs hybrid Cetacean-in-Chief/bullfrog just shows how typically imbecilic we are here.  We even managed to screw up the architecture and kill off most German restaurants.Can‚Äôt wait to buy that floatplane and join my buddy flying packages in Alaska.

        It turns everyone into a sociopath by forcing them to lie even when the truth makes more sense.Ever take a school-bus-driver test/CDL ‚ÄúB‚Äù test?Hypocrisy reigns supreme.  The number of lies one tells in order to pass that test is very large, indeed.  Saying, e.g., that one literally crawled under the bus to inspect the brake pads, rotors, and lines, or that one did not detect a broken leaf-spring, or that merely looking at the engine assures one that there are ‚Äòno missing nor damaged parts‚Äô is simply lying.  Nobody actually does crawl under the damn thing except the mechanic when he‚Äôs inspecting or working on it.

        I‚Äôm a strong proponent of the attitude that ‚ÄúThe world doesn‚Äôt owe you anything.‚Äù Not because I‚Äôm some lolbertarian but because of the inner peace it grants you. You will never be disappointed if you have no expectations to begin with. This will also help with feeling the appropriate gratitude when someone does make an accommodation for you or does some other act of kindness.Besides, if we are supposed to have reciprocal duties and obligations why would I want to have any duty to a psychopathic corporation? I‚Äôd rather see them liquidated Soviet style and their precious corporations broken to pieces and scattered to the winds. I want to see HR Karens loaded into boxcars and shipped off to forced labor camps for the remainder of their miserable lives. I want to see the soyboy geldings in middle management turned into eunuchs and press ganged into collecting garbage and sweeping the streets. I do not want to owe to, or be owed anything from people I have no respect for. At this point I‚Äôd rather serve some post-apocalyptic neighborhood warlord. At least if I get terminated (from existence) by him it will be for actually failing to meet his performance metrics and not some made up bullshit.

                Having been on both sides of the table, the time for expecting, demanding reciprocal obligations is at your employee review. Women tend to be particularly crappy at that, which is the biggest reason they ought to choose a different lifestyle. They will always be disappointed because the corporation didn‚Äôt sense her needs and will take it out on her husband, kids or cats as appropriate.Only a fool would ask for promises like job security, titles, future compensation. The future is unknowable. Congress could and does slip stuff into 2,000 page bills that destroys otherwise valid business plans. Pensions and benefit plans went by the wayside in the 70s and 80s in exactly this way. If it‚Äôs not in your hands, you don‚Äôt have it.

            ‚ÄúYou will never be disappointed if you have no expectations to begin with.‚Äù
Living without expectations sounds like a very empty and soulless existence.
As for the rest of your post, of course none of us feel any obligation to corporations or any other societal institutions because our society is stone-cold dead. But society died, in part, because the reciprocal obligations Z described were obliterated. Like you, I wish to see all of the monsters who control postmodern society destroyed. But after that, when society is rebuilt afresh, I want to see reciprocal obligations restored.

        Behold the feminization of the modern workforce! On display, the non-confrontational, get-along gang, treacly-twee, feelings-uber-alles language we are all forced to mimic. The patently fake deep concern masking complete corporate indifference. The cowardly dismissal over the ether, avoiding the potential meatspace unpleasantness of an in-person interview. A kinder, gentler backstabbing.
I‚Äôm surprised the HR harpy didn‚Äôt end the call with ‚ÄúI just think we need to see other people. But we can still be friends.‚Äù

        Unfortunately, they do build statues to useless committees. See herehttps://www.superstock.com/asset/sculpture-europe-coeur-ludmila-tcherina-symbol-european-union-european-parliament/1848-672261. Which goes hand in hand with the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the EU. One silly committee bestowing honor on another silly committee which had done nothing to produce the result for which it was being awarded. The EU being roughly analogous to the student government council at your high school.

                You are correct.  I had always heard it referred to as a Pareto distribution, but it can now be referred to as a principle.  And it makes sense; even in upper management: 20% of the actors produce 80% of the results.  I‚Äôll wager that a different 20% of upper management produce 80% of the problems.

        One of the worst things about ‚Äúmanagerialism‚Äù is how it‚Äôs co-opted the language and tone of person-to-person concern as a mask for self-interest. It‚Äôs a grotesque form of industrialization: Say these words in this way and get this inevitable result.Except, of course, that assumes that the recipient of the ‚Äúmagic phrase‚Äù is just a robot who will process every input in a predictable way. I hand it to the girl in the video for asserting she was a person, and exposing the callers as the automata who were just executing their programming.Meanwhile, this kind of managerial approach has been a real poison to interpersonal relationships. It‚Äôs driven sincerity and mutual respect‚Äîand even justified criticism‚Äîout of the equation, and replaced it with a paint-by-numbers form of mollifying while avoiding accountability or legal consequence. Back in the  ‚Äò90s, the Pick-Up Artist guys took a lot of flak for gaming the emotional system of women in order to selfishly manipulate them. But what you see in that firing video is really no different. Yet instead of being a disreputable practice, it‚Äôs an approved part of the HR handbook.

            ‚ÄòAgree and Amplify‚Äô is a common technique from ‚ÄòPick-Up‚Äô that HR pansy types often use. Of course, in the night game, it‚Äôs more for bitchy shittests to show you don‚Äôt care while not being combative and staying aloof. In HR it never works because it‚Äôs obvious pandering and corpo speak, ‚Äòwe hear and understand you‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Anyway they use a lot of ‚Äôemotional‚Äô appeal but it never works how they think it does. A committee is not a person, nor are they ever capable of using emotional manipulation past the 3rd-grade level.

            This is an interesting idea, that the sociopathy we see from people nowadays could simply be a product of them mirroring the behavior of the managerial elites.  It‚Äôs kind of like the problem the aristocracy always had where they‚Äôd find a new funny looking article of clothing to wear to mark themselves as aristocrats but pretty soon the peasants were copying them.If your experience with the institutions in life (incidentally the entittes with all the money and power) are entirely sociopathic in nature then the logical assumption one would make is that it‚Äôs normal to treat everyone like garbage and just lie to their faces to achieve whatever goal you have in that moment.  And really that‚Äôs what you see with the way people are incredibly flaky nowadays.I had to get some real estate appraised recently and it took the guy three months of me calling him every week to ask about it.  Every single time it was ‚Äúoh I should have it done by the end of the week‚Äù.

            Having been laid-off myself late last year I can say that the worst part of *any* dealing with the HR machine is the language it uses. I spend my miserable days now reading job ads and then trying to apply to the jobs that look possible. Reading this garbage all day leaves me feeling deeply dirty and soul-sick. It‚Äôs hard to imagine actually *being* one of the creatures who writes these things.I‚Äôm in software and even there it‚Äôs also increasingly difficult to figure out exactly what the hell a given job even is. Concrete skills such as programming languages, software packages, and operating systems are increasingly replaced with a hollowed-out, desiccated corp-speak. The main part of the ad is no longer devoted to describing the job but is now three paragraphs of DIEversity propaganda mixed with business school bullshit about ‚Äúdisrupting the ___ industry‚Äù and of course ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù.These ads also often imply that you (the applicant) need to be overjoyed about the company‚Äôs ‚Äúmission‚Äù however vague, utopian, or just nonsensical it is. I see a lot of ‚Äúgreen energy‚Äù startups that are particularly bad in this. It‚Äôs astounding to think that entire new companies are being spawned based on notions about energy that are at odds with basic physics combined with equally absurd understandings of human beings to guide hiring and guarantee that no one capable of understanding this can be hired.

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶eventually that smart fraction within the elite is overwhelmed by the growing number of sociopathic grifters slithering into the elite.‚ÄùAs this takes place, the entropy that makes for the structural weakness in the system takes its toll. The remedy tends to be dissolution of the top elite or the conspiracy that, vanquishing the other conspiracies, evolves into the rule of the ‚Äústrong man.‚Äù Takimag has a good article today on the potential global future and suggests that China‚Äôs main weakness (main not sole weakness) is the consolidation of power in the person of its current dictator.To some extent our regime may have avoided this outcome by allocating top managerial decision to a committee whose large semi-visible membership vies for power within an overall consensus. But consensuses are prone to empathy as well.This may be partly why Nikki Haley may run as both a Dem and a Pub, the de facto candidate of both parties, to keep a wobbly consensus from further deterioration.

        ‚Äúmillions of Americans are forced to be terrible people in middle-management positions, doing the bidding of management.‚Äù
According to The Gervais Principle, they are the Clueless, a name that matches my experience. Most of them are happy to be in their positions, because they think that being a manager means something more than being a buffer between the top and bottom.

        No one wants to be led by charlatan poseurs who are utterly lacking in character, integrity, competence, or even soul. That is an easy reaction to the dilemma we find ourselves in. And an all-to-easier followup is whiny pissing and moaning about it, as if that was a solution to anything. At some point, you have to get up off the couch and do more than just hurl boos and catcalls from the bleacher seats. For those with a BMI&lt;25, taking to the streets is about as active as they will muster. And no, voting harder is not an activity, its a self-deception.Some day, the environment will significantly change for the worse and there will be no choice but to do or die. Both endpoints are necessary for societal redemption. Choose carefully.

        Spectacular, Z.How true. My last employer was a family run business. The CEO was a WW2 vet, in his 80s when I went to work for him. When I first started I was getting killed by the company‚Äôs mid-level psychotics and managerial ‚Äúelite‚Äù, so one day I just said ‚ÄúScrew it! If I get fired for telling the truth so be it!‚ÄùI called the Old Man up, told him what was going on and asked him what he wanted to do. He flew in from Montreal the next day unannounced‚Ä¶ and suffice it to say ‚Äì our local managerial elite were caught with their pants down. They were not so elite when he left. Dealing with him was a dream ‚Äì you had a problem, ya called him up, dumped it in his lap with the available options‚Ä¶and he made his call and stood on it. Done. Like dinner! üëç It was old world employment ‚Äì probably what it used to be like before the Boomers reinvented the work environment.I personally think that crap like this is largely driven by the presence of women in the workplace. The vid had all the hallmarks of female misbehaviour: secret recordings, squid language, character assassination‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get a straight answer out of either the HR fatty or the young lady. Ironically‚Ä¶Only a Yesterday Man could sort this mess out. He‚Äôd have to go in, dig into the mess personally, take responsibility for the problem, identify the culprit and put the whip on her ass. Today men like that are thrown out the airlock and spaced.Instead we have a pretty young lady who should be at home raising kids of her own ‚Äì in a cubicle farm. As she gets older she‚Äôll inevitably become the same kind of carbunkle as the one that laid her off.This is why people go to work with AK47s‚Ä¶

We had a short interaction. He told me he appreciated a honest man. At the time I didn‚Äôt quite understand why he said that.
As I got older, I started realizing just how mucj bullshit is in the middle. He must‚Äôve been constantly dealing with yes-men and yes-women who are more concerned with their status than doing and saying the right thing.

            Last year my teen daughter‚Äôs car was rear ended and totaled. I settled on a figure with the  insurance company. I thought the payment would be forthcoming but weeks started going by with no money. All calls and emails to the insurance company went unanswered. My credit union held the note on the car. I spoke with the female branch manager about having the credit union bring pressure on the insurance company from their end. The credit union has $1 billion in assests so it is a decent size operation. The female manager said that these things take time and to wait a few months. I emailed the male credit union CEO the next day and received a call from the male credit union lawyer a few hours later who started pressing the insurance company. I received the money in less than a week. The credit union got their loan payoff and I was able to get my daughter another car.  Often it really is a waste of time to speak to anyone but the top guy. So many people are just coasting at work and don‚Äôt want to make even a minimal effort.

Great guy ‚Äì but see, new younger management had taken the reins as of late.So old VP, crooked mfer, stays Ends up suing the company for age discrimination and taking them for a big fat ride when they finally replaced him a few years later. I still laugh thinking about it.

        ‚ÄòWhen the people we call the left claim society has some new moral duty, conservatives never challenge the moral duty, but instead fall into a form of bourgeois anarchism.‚ÄôThe Left essentially is empowered women plus an assortment of fellow-grifters ‚Äî homos, commies, globalists, race players.  E.g., the feminist movement BEGAN in the mid-Nineteenth Century by co-opting abolitionism and ‚Äòrace relations‚Äô.  Joined at the hip.The Right essentially is men, mostly but not exclusively white men.WHY is the question not asked here.WHY does the Right consistently fail to challenge and annul the endless ‚Äòprogressive‚Äô schemes of the Left, instead always seeking refuge in ‚Äòbourgeois anarchism‚Äô?Because modern American men are simps and cowards, and they are afraid of both their wives/daughters/mommies etc., and of the collective political power of women, which has been running the country the past four decades.  DC is basically a coven.Your points about managerialism are valid and well-presented.  But ‚Äî somewhat like conservatives ‚Äî you leave out the most important factor, by far.  The managerialism of the modern West is feminine and feminist in character, that‚Äôs why everywhere you look, women are taking over.The Regime isn‚Äôt just a-masculine, it is rabidly and violently anti-masculine.  Until men face that horrible and heart-shattering truth, nothing changes.

                Thank you. The full quote, from which your trenchant section is drawn, packs even more punch‚Ä¶‚ÄúIt may be inferred again that the present movement for women‚Äôs rights will certainly prevail from the history of its only opponent, Northern conservatism. This [Northern conservatism] is a party which never conserves anything. Its history has been that it demurs to each aggression of the progressive party, and aims to save its credit by a respectable amount of growling, but always acquiesces at last in the innovation. What was the resisted novelty of yesterday is today one of the accepted principles of conservatism; it is now conservative only in affecting to resist the next innovation, which will tomorrow be forced upon its timidity and will be succeeded by some third revolution; to be denounced and then adopted in its turn. American conservatism is merely the shadow that follows Radicalism as it moves forward towards perdition. It remains behind it, but never retards it, and always advances near its leader. This pretended salt hath utterly lost its savor: wherewith shall it be salted? Its impotency is not hard, indeed, to explain. It is worthless because it is the conservatism of expediency only, and not of sturdy principle. It intends to risk nothing serious for the sake of the truth, and has no idea of being guilty of the folly of martyrdom. It always when about to enter a protest very blandly informs the wild beast whose path it essays to stop, that its ‚Äúbark is worse than its bite,‚Äù and that it only means to save its manners by enacting its decent role of resistance: The only practical purpose which it now subserves in American politics is to give enough exercise to Radicalism to keep it ‚Äúin wind,‚Äù and to prevent its becoming pursy and lazy, from having nothing to whip.‚ÄùSome things haven‚Äôt changed a bit.

                The USPS does have a huge sales force focusing on business clientele. Every carrier and clerk is encouraged to submit sales leads, and station managers are required to follow up with a certain number of them per quarter. USPS aggressively markets EDDM (Every Door Direct Mail) and parcel shipping services, because without them it could not even fund its operations. First Class postage is now a small, shrinking, irrelevant slice of the pie.What this means for Cloudflare I am not sure, but if the analogy carries over, it means that they survive by upselling clients on expensive data and security services above and beyond the standard package, without which the company could not exist.This touches on something that I‚Äôve talked about for many years. I don‚Äôt think the internet is naturally profitable. The enormous infrastructure buildout and constant maintenance it requires are too costly to be supported by any organic improvements in productivity it generates, if there even are any. The internet was and is a gigantic bubble which was funded by unrepeatable one-off events such as the labor arbitrage of shifting manufacturing and programming to Asia, and the demographic overhang of the Baby Boom generation.Now that that powder is spent, the internet is running up against the limits of complexity and growth. Far from being a permanent revolution, it is going to end being a rather transient phenomenon in human history.

Interesting theory. You could say the same about roads, though. Would be nice to see some serious analysis/expansion of your theory and a comparison to roads and other expensive infrastructure with socialized costs.

                        You could not say the same about roads. Anyone can see that the interstate highway system, for instance, has paid for itself many, many times over. There are maybe a few useless roads here and there, but for the most part all roads pay for themselves. I think ID has an interesting hypothesis here, although I don‚Äôt feel qualified to address it.

                        I did not say whether roads do or do not pay for themselves. I am saying that the cost of road infrastructure is socialized and the returns are not always obvious, just like the cost and returns of digital infrastructure. Before we definitely say that these two things are completely different, I would love to see some numbers, which, I understand, is not a trivial task.
And yes, ID has an interesting hypothesis, hence my comment‚Ä¶

                    Maybe the post office should get together with the DMV. Instead of just selling your DMV data, the Post Office could share all the mail you have received and combine it with the DMV data.I‚Äôve been thinking and saying this for a few years, especially around social media.  We‚Äôve been on a money printing party since the mid 90s. This dramatically lowered borrowing costs and made all these unprofitable businesses viable somehow.As a society we should really discuss what we get from our cell phones vs what they cost.  The cost has been absolutely enormous.  What the heck is Gen-Z going to be like having never lived without it?

                last year I registered a personal vanity email domain via the iCloud menu on my iPhone (I know‚Ä¶ I have several other domain names purchased directly from registrars for other purposes). Apple uses Cloudflare for registering these domains and of course passes on my info to them.So for ages I kept getting emails from some female sales droid at Cloudfare wanting to offer me Zoom consultations to see what else Cloudflare could do for me. This is just mentally retarded. I mean given the sales channel, it‚Äôs clear that I want nothing to do with @#$%ing Cloudflare and the likelihood of their growing their bottom line by upselling some kind of corporate edge presence or turbo DNS solution for multinationals to a private individual who has just purchased a cheap *personal* service is pretty much zero.But as other posters have pointed out, it‚Äôs most unlikely that these sales bints with their marketing degrees have any idea at all about the products they‚Äôre pushing. And even when they *do* sell to MegaCorp, just imagine the marketing buzzword bullshit back and forth until after all the contracts are signed and kickbacks baked in and finally the calls go down to the Nobody Nerds in the respective basements to ‚Äòhook shit up and make it sing‚Äô. Incredible, really.

                Yeah, you can‚Äôt compete with Cloudfare, but she could leverage whatever qualifications she has into some niche, which is all an entrepreneur is doing anyway. The only real way to make money doing commodities is to be the biggest on the block. (Note, doing commodities, not doing derivatives.)
The only real question is if she has such qualities, or if she is more of a follower. Which is not terrible. That is the traditional role of the fair sex.

            A list of companies that are actually the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù of the entire world would have Cloudflare very near the top. A to-do list for becoming its competitor would start with something like ‚Äúkill every NATO soldier.‚Äù

        I see this at my job.  More and more soulless bureaucrats where there used to be useful employees.  Also I see competence draining away over time.I enjoy the technical bits of my job.  It is interesting work and provides real benefits to America &amp; Americans.  Problem is, I have to wade through more &amp; more managerialism/bureaucracy/‚Äùcompliance‚Äù BS and such to actually get a chance to do my job.  And all the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù funcitons no longer provide support, but expect me to do the heavy lifting of the support task and then they check a box and allow me to get something done.  Kinda crazy.I do have an exit plan to execute once a few things line up.

            Yeah, seems to be the same in most places.In my role, it is suddenly decided that ‚Äòthe customers‚Äô want evidence of compliance to ‚Äòcyber-security‚Äô standards. The customers actually don‚Äôt really know what they want, they have just been told that ‚ÄúYou must be compliant with with ISO-0290930LGBT to be secure!‚Äù‚Ä¶ and this is where the make-work begins.I spend a good half of my working week addressing things that have been flagged by software designed to help make us compliant with these standards. Most of the ‚Äòconcerns‚Äô are security vulnerabilities, often marked ‚Äòcritical‚Äô, that on closer inspection affect packages installed on the computer that are never used, or just won‚Äôt be exploited. But we must appease the compliance software.The net result is less actual work done on making the system better or the software better in-line with what the customeractuallywants.I‚Äôve always said that, at least a waiter in a busy cafe knows his labour matters ‚Äì he can literally see the customers demanding his services, or the services his employer offers through him. But what about your standard office job? Some manager tells you that we need to re-write our PHP application in TypeScript ‚Äì why? Fashion? Where‚Äôs the demand.If you can‚Äôt see the obvious demand for your labour, your job is probably make-work ‚Äì more generally, if you work in an office, you job is highly likely make-work!

            That‚Äôs why I retired early at 54 in 2015. I liked the technical engineering parts of my job but came to despise the marketing/accounting business school newcomers who were ruining our good name with their short-term thinking. They were completely indifferent to the decades of history that built our reputation in the avionics industry (we made the ‚Äòblack box‚Äô flight recorders). They acted as though the company was created for them the moment they arrived and they treated our dedication to quality and integrity as an annoyance that got in the way of their short-term goals. It became dangerous to speak the truth when it contradicted the feckless management lies we were expected to repeat.

            Agree fully. I have never objected to people getting paid for useful work, or getting paid for founding a company and making a profit off their labor, their service, or their creation.But ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù as we understand it today is merely a corporatist ripoff, where money is made by being in bed with the government, by offshoring production to Third World nations, and by paying employees the lowest possible amount and demanding the highest amount of time and loyalty.Fuck. That.You do not ‚Äúget ahead‚Äù in this country by ‚Äúworking hard‚Äù any more. You get ahead by being a ‚Äúprotected minority,‚Äù by being a total subservient lackey, and by obtaining a ‚Äújob‚Äù where you are grifting off the labor of others. I am not going to enslave myself to line the pockets of some corporate HR bitches who will cut me loose at the drop of a hat without conscience over some stupid shit.Long ago I concluded that in most ‚Äújobs‚Äù you are actually getting paid for being a lackey to The System, not for anything you actually produce. It is my observation that almost every employer out there prefers a moronic fuck-up who doesn‚Äôt rock the boat to someone who thinks for himself, is independent, and truth-oriented.It practically sickens me to hear ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù like Hannity blabbering about ‚Äúcapitalism.‚ÄùI‚Äôm not a Marxist or a socialist at all. Marx was wrong about a lot of things but not everything. National socialism ‚Äî lower case ‚Äún‚Äù and lower case ‚Äús‚Äù ‚Äî is a Third Way between global communism and global capitalism.

        This is why I encourage anyone, especially competent white males, to drop out of the system to the extent you are able to do so.  Learn to live on less, start your own business, and find ways of getting what you need without going through the big megacorps.  Obviously not everyone can be an entrepreneur, but if you‚Äôre stuck in one of these corporate jobs, don‚Äôt give them more than is required of you, and always be working toward an exit plan.  Eventually you will be replaced anyway with a DEI hire, so it‚Äôs a good idea to start planning for that eventuality now.  An added bonus is that the resiliency you build now could become vitally important as things start to break down over the coming decade.

                Apprenticeship is a centuries old form of passing on knowledge, tradition and skills. Its replacement by exams and less continuous relationships between master and apprentice in modern times in places such as the university is part of why standards, competence and productivity is falling there.

                I once met a clerk at a Verizon store who used to be a Sheriff‚Äôs deputy. I imagine he took a significant pay and benefits cut doing that. I decided not to ask him why.

            This is very solid advice, and in fact has been ongoing since at least the late Eighties/early Nineties. It started with professions such as law and medicine as white male attorneys and doctors saw more opportunities in solo and small practices due to what would become known as ‚ÄúDEI.‚Äù This naturally spread to the trades, which Lineman pointed out, and various aspects of technology.I would suggest that the dissolution and fragmentation of localities, counties and even to a small degree states from the central government represents the same phenomenon. This is a reason for optimism and could prove fatal over time for large government and corporations. Sure, there are pushbacks such as the Covid lockdowns, but at the end of the day those are little more than pissing in the wind futilely.As ray pointed out above, the young lady who is Z‚Äôs focus should be home making babies. If that happens, it will be the best thing for her and society.

            We need a hybrid approach. Some ought to pursue the avenues to wealth and power the society provides, keep their opinions/observations to themselves but use said money and power to our ends.Others should not drop out. We must be careful not to forfeit our place. There goal is to dispossess and displace us. Why make that any easier.We must also attack. Attacking means suing to the ground any and all institutions as they all engage anti-white discrimination and dispossession ‚Äì which is illegal under the laws of their regime. We must throw the haymakers they have made available to us.The same is true of college. Now for primary education we need to drop out and we need to build a curriculum and network of education that is excellent. That will include being of value to industry that needs us. As Lineman says that includes the trades. Let‚Äôs support our folk in entering and dominating the trades. This is also true of professions. Let‚ÄôsWe also need to stay in the fight for becoming judges. We must pack jurisdictions with our folks so the time expiry on the lawfare to punish white dispossession is longer. They are filling the judiciary with their anti-white apparatchiks.We must not surrender and forfeit. We just have to be extremely smart about how we navigate the ruins. Be truly better than the rest and engage in life, but do it buttressed by a growing and strengthening network of our people at your back and you at theirs.

                I don‚Äôt see most of us peeling off as forfeiting and surrendering. Anything that financially and personally empowers our people is a net positive and the most secure track to there is outside the main system. Yes, we need to have people in institutional places like the judiciary and the hybrid approach is the proper one there, as an example, but what is inevitable is a parallel society that in time subsumes the established order, which already is falling apart.

                    I guess I need to understand what that looks like. Does it look like the Amish or like Orthodox Jews?How do you prevent that from turning yourself into slaves? In other words,I think we should take advantage of home schooling to build our own school system. Even that will require operating within the system so that you can enact laws where you no longer pay taxes into the school system or you get a rebate if you homeschool.Can you point me to articles and books that describe what you are talking about? Do they include case studies of where and how this has worked in the past at the scale of 200 million people of 335 (350 now), on a continent?I am all for building such a network and parallel institutions. I just wonder how that can work at scale ‚Äì particularly when we pay to keep the system working against us afloat.

            Brilliant statement Z, but it is wrong. The riot outside is also managed by managers who have carefully created plans to manage the ensuing crisis into what they want to manage next.Managerialism is really the management of destruction. The end state of managerialism is total destruction of everything and then them turning on each other. Another option is something I have heard Z describe as, ‚Äúthe guillotines running 24√ó7.‚Äù Another is some manager faction gets serious about taking the radical actions necessary to stop the descent. But, they are all in some way on the take from the benefits of gaming managerialism.I watched, ‚ÄúThe Fall of Minneapolis‚Äù, this weekend. Everyone should see this and share it with a personal note with everyone they know. In the doc, Ellison‚Äôs son is agitating for defunding the police. Alongside him is a city Supervisor who is doing the same. You look at her bio and it is classic managerialist. Odd degrees at elite institutions and slithering around from political campaign to foundation to elite college. Then you see here specialty ‚Äì advocating for safe biking communities. She is probably a Soros/WEF plant. It seems straight out of a Batman Dark Knight movie that is writing itself in real life. Destroy Minneapolis to make it a smart city of the future where you ride bikes safe from ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ unpoliced savages???A great example of this on the, ‚Äúopposition‚Äôs side‚Äù, is Peter Thiel. Thiel has beautifully said exactly what Z said about great men. He said that we never have ticker tape parades for individuals any more. Yet look at Thiel. His gaggle of IDW reformers are a bunch of useless academics whose primary concern is white men‚Äôs inevitable reaction to being dispossessed in an environment where genocide is advocated. I mean, that is one of the initial premises of managerialism ‚Äì managing perceptions as they called it in the 90s under the Clintonistas. They aren‚Äôt concerned about white men being dispossessed and living under threat of genocide and changing that situation, they are concerned about white men organizing to put a stop to this immoral insanity.That is his tower of guys who will save the West. Meanwhile, he lets his guy Karpenbergerstein run Palantir. This psychopath runs around Europe trying to sell Palantir to governments because it will stop the rise of fascism and prevent terrorism.You know what will prevent the rise of, ‚Äúfascism‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt fascism but European men trying to ensure their survival and prevent terrorism? Stop and reverse the replacement migration. But no! Karpenbergerstein would lose sales. In managerial speak, he would no longer have a value proposition. He would have again as they say, a technology in search of a problem. You see how this works?Maybe we should have a ticker tape parade for Thiel and Karpenbergerstein. It will be a series of floats with Thiel, the *steins brothers and clansmen, and Karp each on their own float. On Thiel‚Äôs he‚Äôll pay his guys who are shooting anasthesia into the masses while behind his back the government he attacks with words will stuff his pockets with money.On the *stein‚Äôs float they will smile on computer monitors while they tape the mouths and bind the hands of white men while hordes of orcs approach with machetes, torches and pipe bombs. On Karpenbergerstein‚Äôs float he will smile as he locks a jail cell full of European men who wave their nation‚Äôs flags and hold ‚ÄòKeep Sweden Swedish‚Äô signs for their particular country. In another jail cell will be a bunch of Muslims living like Kings sending out orders to drug runners. On one side of the float will be the beautiful pre-60s Scandinavian town and city. On the other side will be the surveillance dystopia that Palantir creates to ‚Äúadd value to the society, make government more efficient and provide solutions that ensure trust and safety for all.‚ÄùI am not joking. I think this would be a great and powerful memetic moment. Give Thiel his ticker tape parade ‚Äì but let it show how managers are not going to put an end to managerialism. Maybe I‚Äôll see if I can Gen AI this imagery into existence.

                My beautiful Southern city‚Äôs downtown has been ruined by those bike lanes, and they are slithering, to use that delightful word that has manifested this morning, out into the more affluent parts of town.   They have replaced parking spaces, and what used to be full traffic lanes are now covered in diagonal white stripes as a buffer.  And because of the obliteration of those lanes, it takes longer to get through a light.
