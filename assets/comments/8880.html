        I am continually astounded at humanity‚Äôs willingness to be conned by politicians into believing those politicians are intelligent and well meaning. Hillary, and Obama, are both dumber than a bag of hoe handles and nasty selfish pieces of shit.My dad was raised in Nazi Germany, became a Hitler youth and a devout Nazi. That all ended with his capture by the Brits and 3 years as a POW in Canada, which turned out rather not to be a nation of starveling peasants ruled by Jews. He used to love-hate looking at videos of Hitler‚Äôs speeches and asking himself out loud why he had been so crazy as to believe in such an obviously nasty, stupid, lunatic. No doubt many will do the same in our old age looking at videos of both Obama and Hillary.Never ascribe to conspiracy that which can be adequately explained by malice or stupidity. Or both, for Hillary.

            Bingo. Never ascribe brilliance to a simple lack of moral and ethical boundaries.

            ‚ÄúI am continually astounded at humanity‚Äôs willingness to be conned by politicians into believing those politicians are intelligent and well meaning.  Hillary, and Obama, are both dumber than a bag of hoe handles and nasty pieces of shit‚Äù.  Yes, a thousand times yes.People have this deep-down, emotional need for some sort of good environment and happy ending.  So they buy into these utopian fantasy worlds that just might be possible.  These nasty, piece of shit politicians play that need to their own benefit, generally with a special contempt for these people they use to capture and maintain political power.  These leaders may be dumber than a bag of rocks, but they do know how to work the system.  Sharks have no real brain, but they, too, work their environment to their own favor, and to the detriment of pretty much everything they come in contact with.

                It‚Äôs not smarts, it‚Äôs instinct. Just as a snail pulls into a shell when you poke it, or a cat responds when you wiggle a feather at the end of a stick, her political and personal instincts respond to the sight and sound of a checkbook opening up.  Nothing more, nothing less.  It is a mindless response. It is so ingrained that the normal human responses to ordinary things are completely subordinated to it.  This is part of the reason why she must be coached and scripted to do things such as pause and smile, or that really annoying thing where she points at someone semi-randomly and then waves at them when she comes out on stage.  Like a shark, she just swims and vacuums up prey, which in this case is dollars instead of food swimming around.  I would challenge anyone to try to engage with her in any human way and come away impressed.  Not all of it is the Parkinson‚Äôs. Lay a checkbook on the side table and then try to engage her in a conversation.  Watch what happens.

                    Here‚Äôs some more.  Hillary was in it for the money, Huma was probably in it to get the Muslim Brotherhood front and center in public policy, and Carlos Danger was in it for the sex.  They were all more or less happy together, until circumstances stopped working out for them.  The relationships go immediately from pillow talk to ‚Äúwho?‚Äù  No compassion, no support.  It was all about what they were in it for, not any human comfort or relationship at all.  I pray for Huma and Anthony‚Äôs daughter.

        It surprises me that no one seems to notice the obvious comparison between HRC and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, widow of a former Argentine president, then president herself, finally voted out and now facing a raft of corruption charges: much of the same arrogant overconfidence in her invulnerability; a cadre of fanatic supporters, usually beneficiaries of ‚Äúgimmes‚Äù; an obvious incompetent as shown by her record, etc.
‚ÄúThird-worldization‚Äù of the USA? Take away the consumer goods and in many ways it‚Äôs worse there than elsewhere.

            .‚Äì Read &amp; I‚Äôll tell you the year you were born ‚ÄìA. Weiner should find a hole to go in &amp; not pleasure self by constant in &amp; out, going &amp; coming.If Anthony did contact HC by email, it‚Äôd probably be  the 1st time she‚Äôd come in contact with a Weiner.Take my advice. Run &amp; hide bc if HC thinks you cost her election, you in danger, just like Mr Assange. HC‚Äôs squirreled away $2Bil offshore, she‚Äôll have the $ to hire all the hitters for all her haters. Security caught one scaling Assange‚Äôs Embsy but, he ‚Äògot away.‚Äô Police response time- 2hrs. Police distance by foot-120 secs. Hmmm.Re MedBias: TheWeatherChannel is biased bc they have a pro-weather far-wing agenda. It‚Äôs clear because of high pressure they‚Äôre a front for Big Weather.1)Think of a disgusting person. If they scream- ‚ÄòA meteor is going to hit US in 4hrs!‚Äô Do you say- ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre disgusting so I‚Äôm not gonna see if it‚Äôs true?‚Äô 2) A low IQ man says 4+4=8. Do u say- ‚ÄòHis IQ is so low, 8 can‚Äôt be right.‚ÄôWhich is more important: The source, or the accuracy of the information?Even if known liar HC or Donna Brazile told me a meteor was about to strike the US, I‚Äôm not gonna stand around bc I distrust the source, bet cash money- I‚Äôm gonna find out if it‚Äôs true!Which brings me to the weak attempts by Dems to convince us to ignore truths being revealed by WLks- ‚Äòbc they were unfairly obtained.‚Äô -It almost makes tears well up in my eyes.Most of us dislike Russia. Dems want us to disregard the ems bc they claim Russia‚Äôs behind them. So the hell what? Even if we gave Dems benefit of the doubt, Russia didn‚Äôt create the ems, they just hacked ‚Äòum &amp; revealed them to us.I don‚Äôt know their real source, but I DO know Dems don‚Äôt contest their accuracy. They don‚Äôt even go, ‚ÄòNuh uh!‚Äô when confronted. They just throw up ‚ÄòJazz Hands‚Äô &amp; shout, ‚ÄòRUSSIA!‚Äô ‚Äì Like that matters. Just how stupid do we are they think?The Bible has 66 books. Subtract your age from 66, &amp; add 50 ‚Äì that‚Äôs the year you were born.Speaking of which, shame on you DonBrazile for dragging Christ‚Äôs Holy Name thru the mud when you invoked your so-called Christianity while lying to MegKelly about giving Clinton camp questions. You‚Äôre not only a liar, you support the murder/dismemberment of babies. WWJD? You might sit in a pew on Sunday, but that doesn‚Äôt make you a Christian..

            Drake;  you don‚Äôt think this might have not been inadvertently left there?  ‚Äî placed there?  ‚Äìstored there?Oh, I think someone knew what (s)he was doing when deciding to back-up the phone onto the laptop.  And I am not sure Huma will find herself in more hot water regarding not mentioning it when she formally separated from State.gov.  I mean, the FBI has had Weiner‚Äôs laptop for some time, and we don‚Äôt know for how long.  Could be they had it before she left to work (honestly, if it‚Äôs even possible) for Clinton Inc.Something tells me Huma knew she might need some life-insurance.And something tells me the Wikileaks may be identical to what is in that file folder.  Wouldn‚Äôt that be a gas?

        I‚Äôve been saying this for a while (though not as well). Clueless about data security is one thing; the president isn‚Äôt a DBA. Too stupid to hire an expert who *does* have a clue is a different matter. That‚Äôs alarming. It‚Äôs typical of our ruling class, but I guess I‚Äôm still not used to it.
Scarier, this wasn‚Äôt nuclear secrets or national security or something that nobody expects a Democrat to give a damn about anyway. This was her OWN ass on the line. This is how careless and stupid she is with the stuff she actually sincerely  cares about.

        This is the kind of stupidity that gets people killed for no good reason.  That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre really talking about.  It‚Äôs really a character test.
Will the next POTUS get you killed to keep a political secret or to keep from getting caught breaking more laws or grifting more blood money?  I think the answer is pretty definitive regarding HRC.
It‚Äôs not only yes, but yes, repeatedly until she is stopped.  ‚ÄúMmmm‚Ä¶  Good times.‚Äù said the Reaper.

                Feckless criminal intent by Hillary Clinton and obama got those guys killed.It required malice and forethought to deny cross border authority to the rescue teams spooled up on the tarmac ready to aid them.That is not stupidity. Stupidity is ignorant omission. That was deliberate commission.Lot of people aren‚Äôt aware the only thing keeping those rescue teams, 3 of them, was one word, Go, from POTUS. Nothing more, nothing less. Somebody chose, key word here, chose not to grant cross border authority.

        Amen. Working on hospital boards people use encrypted emails all the time. One guy I knew found out that a buddy of his was going to be adversely affected by something the hospital was doing and tried to forward an encrypted email. The attempt to go outside the system automatically reported his action and he was forced to resign from the board for violation of fiduciary duty. Hillary is guilty of much worse.

                Many businesses prohibit employees from bringing digital cameras or smart phones to the workplace for that very reason. Also, text encrypted with PGP shows on the screen as gibberish until it is decrypted with the recipient‚Äôs private key, rendering a photo useless.

        Allegedly Podesta didn‚Äôt change his password after well the initial Wikileaks release, so some script kiddies were able to download even more of his emails.
My study of both Lenin‚Äôs and Hitler‚Äôs circles is that both were filled with crackpots, drug addicts, deviants, and the incompetent to marginally competent. What they were good at was lying and doing really terrible things that their opponents never thought them capable of.

            Been on this earthly coil long enough to know one the. And in the larger scheme these crook are worthless but for one thing only. What matters is it going to take guts, and trial, most likely a river of blood, tribulations of epic proportions to fix this kind of stupid.But most of all, it begins with each of us, and things change when we become a plurality of people who refuse our consent to the state and its slavery.When we become brothers in abolition of this state and the state of affairs. That is when we win our true liberty we each where born with. Sound corny, provincial? Ya, I‚Äôm proudly guilty of such.Know what? When we do that, we become something, we attain something we don‚Äôt possess as isolated and scattered souls, our souls ruled by these savages in Brooks Brothers suits.A Legitimacy which nothing our nobody can deny, or stand against.And because of that winning, we evolve into people who have no need of police, or ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù, or any form of official sanction or permission, or politicians. Because after all this time, you got to ask the right question here. just how has it worked out for us?. It is where we become truly civilized people, people who are capable of governing our own affairs, thank you very much.

        Or a case of ‚Äúa man‚Äôs got to know his limitations‚Äù.  ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre brilliant politicians, so we‚Äôre clever at everything else‚Äù.  Hillary would have benefited by hiring an ex-Mob guy to help them out with OpSec.  Though that might have meant Hillary had to wander around in a robe mumbling to herself to keep up the ruse.  It will be delightful if the final unwinding comes because nobody realized that Huma registering the MS account as well as her Yahoo account to the Apple email client on her shared computer meant an almost perfect mirror of her activity was left there.  What also gets me is the utter stupidity of government (Trump‚Äôs point on many occasions).  At work the rules about use of personal email are hard and fast.  And the systems have sniffers that will trigger on items such as forwarding emails to gmail or yahoo accounts.  Particularly if these have attachments.  You don‚Äôt use personal email and could be fired for it.  Of course as a government regulated financial services company, we have hard and fast record retention and production on demand requirements.  As for the State Department clown car‚Ä¶..not so much.

        It doesn‚Äôt require great intelligence to rule. It does require honesty and integrity to rule well. She has neither. She also has none of the other qualities necessary for good leadership. She is not energetic, she is not skilled, she uses naked corruption and the complicit media to get where she is. Without the media and deep state backing her she would be dead in the water or in jail waiting a trial and prison sentence.A quarter of Americans are utterly untrustworthy. Another quarter are too irresponsible to be allowed to vote on anything in a republic. That leaves fifty percent. If we are successful in taking back our government we should seriously think about why we allow them to have any part in our government anyway. Standards need to be raised, the vote should not be automatic just because you‚Äôre eighteen.

        Maybe Hillary is not stupid; she figured that she could do whatever she pleased, illegal or otherwise, and not have to worry about any repercussions. After all, she has been a liar and crook since leaving Yale and she has always gotten away with murder. In fact, every time she has been implicated in something crooked, she finds herself propelled into a higher and more responsible position (e.g., lesbo wife / attorney to  first lesbo lady, to US Senator to Secretary of State to maybe president).And given her political and media connections she most likely was convinced , and for very good reason, that she was above and immune to any laws.Her life of deceit, fraud, lies and illegality has taken her within a few steps of becoming president of the USA and, in her own mind and not totally unjustified , she really believed she is superwoman.IMHO, it is not her stupidity that MAY  lead to her downfall, it is her arrogance and hubris.

        Indeed she‚Äôs too stupid to rule, but she‚Äôs more than corrupt and ambitious enough to seize power.  Yes she‚Äôs operating like they did back in the 70‚Äôs with technology, however she makes up for that with salting allies and cronies throughout D.C. Men like Kadzick(who happens to be Pdesta‚Äôs BFF) at the DOJ who will be overseeing the laptop investigation.As it stands I don‚Äôt care if there is SAP and TS/SCI documents on that laptop along with evidence of treason, Hillary will not be prosecuted and will probably be our next president. It doesn‚Äôt matter if this destroys the FBI along with peoples trust in government and fractures the country, Hillary and her supporters don‚Äôt care.Perhaps this is a over pessimistic appraisal but as Trump has stated repeatedly, we‚Äôre dealing with a rigged system that favors criminals like the Clintons.

        Another thing that Clinton did ‚Äì which the intel community does as well ‚Äì was to compartmentalize her data.  She didn‚Äôt have just one email account (e.g.HR***@*********il.com)‚Ä¶she had several‚Ä¶as the ‚Äú22‚Äù implies.  There‚Äôs also publish reporting of a HRC17, for example.  Why compartmentalize, you ask?  Because people on HRC22 might be focused on routine State Dept. business, but HRC17 is Clinton Foundation (as an example, not because I know for sure).  And HRC10 might be just for re-election stuff.  And HRC5 might be ‚Äúyoga classes / wedding-funeral arrangements‚Äù and so on.  The people in one compartment don‚Äôt have to know about the other compartments necessarily.It also makes deleting the emails much, much easier.  What‚Äôs that?  You got a FOIA request from Judicial Watch?  Oh, well, turn over HRC22, and delete the rest!  You don‚Äôt have to comb through 60,000 emails if you know you just need to delete everything in the HRC17 bucket‚Ä¶which‚Ä¶conveniently‚Ä¶you‚Äôve decided is ‚Äúpersonal in nature‚Äù because it‚Äôs the Clinton Foundation email.The reason why Wikileaks has been so successful in its planned takedown of Clinton, Inc. is that all compartments have an integration point in the chain.  There‚Äôs always a place high enough up where everything connects back together again.  In the case of Wikileaks, that is John Podesta.It is not an accident that NONE of the Wikileaks have included emails to or from Hillary Clinton.  None.  Zero.When that compartment is revealed the whole thing is going to come crashing down.

                She‚Äôs not even in the cc block on them‚Ä¶that is weird to the point of being a deliberate withholding of the ones she is on.  They‚Äôve said there‚Äôs another dump coming.  It‚Äôll be interesting to see when they dump it.
I‚Äôm not convinced Assange wants Clinton to lose.  Damage, cripple, wound‚Ä¶but not kill.  He‚Äôs a big time Lefty, and there are loyalties in play.  At some point those people are more loyal to the cause than to the truth.

            If Wikileaks is really setting up for a final run of Hillary‚Äôs e-mails, I would bet there are quite a few ‚Äúeyebrow raisers‚Äù in them.  The cache might even go to the idea of how they had to spoon feed her with little bits of info because she doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to handle big chunks of information and strategy.  That is my guess, the e-mails will reveal how little she is in touch with things. Some of the e-mails from other sources suggest as much.

        I recall the original Superman film with Christopher Reeve in which super-genius Gene Hackman had bumbling idiot Ned Beatty as his sidekick who, while loyal and amusing, was always going to make more problems than he solved.Perhaps HRC thought this was the model her bid for world domination.On a slightly more serious note, I am a little surprised the Clinton mob didn‚Äôt use something like PGP to encrypt the emails, though perhaps they can still be cracked; we just haven‚Äôt been told that it isn‚Äôt as securely encrypted as advertised. There is however the issue of seeing an encrypted message and suspecting it is really important. I used to use PGP for fun even when discussing how well my sports team was doing with family. I can imagine intelligence agencies getting giddy and trying to work out why me grumbling about another home defeat is so secret.

        There is another allegory here. They are not so stupid they won‚Äôt do whatever it takes to hide what they have been up to. Which is of such a scale there is no hiding it, like the clinton email system once they sent messages outside it. Here‚Äôs the thing none of us are noticing. This isn‚Äôt Watergate which involved a couple dozen people committing relatively minor felonies for political purposes among fellow politicians between tow political parties. The clintons represent a state of corruption and influence so far ranging, in dollar amounts alone, equal to GDP of a lot of countries, maybe many countries combined. There was a piece on ZERO Hedge about the Clintons moving 8.1 billion dollars to Qatar, along with purchasing a rather expensive compound, and a number of other members of the political class such as the Bush‚Äôs acting in similar fashion in Bolivia. By the way, both those countries have no extradition treaty with the US Government. Funny that.Excuse me, but politicians don‚Äôt make 8.1 billion dollars, afford secret compounds in foreign country‚Äôs, and stash their money in foreign banks unless they are seriously wealthy from corrupt activities.My point here is, the crimes treason and corruption is so deep and rampant, is it unreasonable to speculate these crooks may very well do unthinkable things before January 2017 rather than allow what they have done become exposed if Trump is elected? Think about that. We are dirt people here, if we where to be apprised fully of what these people have done, knowing now what is most likely only the tip of the iceberg, is it unreasonable to suppose the political class would have good reason to be afraid of us and our reaction, the demands for justice, maybe even revenge, for what they have done to our country in the name of their greed and power?

            I don‚Äôt think the system is going to change. If Trump makes it in and starts to ‚Äòdrain the swamp‚Äô I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll last long.

                Oh it will change one way or the other. Because when the ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô party that is going for Trump finally figures out that they‚Äôve been duped again because there never was any voting their way out of this to begin with, they will instantly become the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm gonna get you sucka‚Äô party. Change only begins with each of us. Sure people can be moved to great things by great leaders, regardless it all begins with each of us. The system is changing in one way though. The scope of the lawless disregard for The Rule of Law is expanding exponentially by the day by the very nature of corruption of the elites lust to retain absolute power. Everything they do now involves surviving that illegitimacy. They used to only have to maintain the appearance of legitimacy. Not any longer. Profound difference.There is two ways this goes. They double down and turn this republic into a full blown police state to repress dissent, or it collapses. There is a third option, we might get unbelievably lucky, enough people have had enough of this shit and vote Trump in the greatest landslide of all time. But it isn‚Äôt Trump who will change the country for the better, that only comes from and begins with each of us. Otherwise we end up in the same pickle all over again.

                    If TPTB attempt to impose a ‚Äúfull-blown police state,‚Äù they will be signing their own death warrants. I recently read that there are ~100 deer hunters in the US for every armed federal agent  If they kill just ~10% of the feds, so many of the rest would resign that the government would collapse from lack of enforcers. And we‚Äôre not even talking about the millions of other armed Americans. This is why the 2nd Amendment exists, and why TPTB want to destroy it.

        Good article with a lot of good points.  The stupidity of the Clinton‚Äôs allowed the rank and file of the FBI to overthrow the power of James Comey and Loretta Lynch and force a reopening of the investigation.  It in all reality a coup against the power structure.  It was successful because that power structure is led by stupid people.

            The release of the Marc Rich file?  Comey had final review for the FBI (per ZH) but declined to make any charges. Looks like the coup continues. Interesting (if ZH is right) that the main stream media is completely ignoring the Comey-Clinton connection on this one.

        Their problem: when you‚Äôre setting up an ostensibly straight criminal enterprise an entitled mid-wit would figure they ought not bring in an unvetted outside technical expert.  They might be a plant from some law enforcement organization or, even worse, an honest guy who‚Äôd be smart enough to twig that it was a criminal enterprise and also enough to realize that the rest of the sociopathic morons were likely to screw up and get busted.  And if it went South he‚Äôd also have to figure that he‚Äôd be the likely fall guy.  In that scenario he‚Äôs practically forced to rat them out sooner or later out of simple self-preservation.  So blind loyalty (= stupid) has got to be #1.The Mafia, OTOH, don‚Äôt have that exact problem because it‚Äôs pretty obvious who they are from the get go, so it‚Äôs pretty hard for a guy smart enough to be useful to not see what‚Äôs up from the start and so become inadvertently involved in a criminal enterprise.  Plus everybody knows about their ‚Äòretirement‚Äô plan.

        As far back as the days of the Clinton co-presidency, it was apparent that Hillary is a dimwit.  She has always been unable to speak publicly without relying on text provided to her by someone else.  Her first televised speech in the Senate should have embarrassed her into resigning her seat, but she apparently considered her words to be genius.  ‚Äúwe‚Äôve gone from CO2 to seeya later‚Äù, she quipped.
Evil people are always stupid.  They may exhibit a low, animal cunning, but no true intelligence, no wit, and no understanding of any human feeling.

        This is exactly what I said when everybody was crying about Hillary &amp; Crew, ‚Äúdeleting their emails‚Äù.  No, they did not.  No, they could not.  The only emails they could have possibly deleted would be those within the server, and not sent out to anyone outside of the server.  SO many of their emails had BCC and CC‚Äôs, that it was obvious they were no longer in existence, meaning, duh!  They went through all of this for no reason, at all.  It served only to cause the FBI and DOJ (yes, even the DOJ) to look askew at Hillary‚Äôs State team, and whatever she gets for this is due.I mean, I hope she gets something in the manner of retribution, but given the way the whole government (and msm and others) seem to act around this woman and react (or not) to her criminal offenses, I cannot say she will be charged with anything.And this proves what a problem this country is in.Good post.

        Z, great post. But is there really a distinction between corrupt and stupid? They seem to be corollaries.

        [‚Ä¶] things that‚Äôs come through loud and clear with the Wikileaks is that Hillary and Company are the gang that couldn‚Äôt shoot straight. They‚Äôre terrible at what they do, and they get away with it only because they have a media [‚Ä¶]

        To Stupid To Rule is in itself a inappropriate title for this article as the Gov is for the People by the People. The Executive is not a rulership nor is it a Kingship, or Dictatorship!

            It would be an inappropriate title if we weren‚Äôt, in fact, being ruled by the psychos who hold office.  According to our cover story, the US is a ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù of sorts in which the people are the bosses of the office holders.  That‚Äôs so patently false that only a retard could believe it.
