        The root spectrum is neither political nor cultural. It is productive versus parasitic. For most of our history, it was the most robust among us that lived long enough to reproduce, and we are their descendants. The advent of great affluence (and the rise of the professional grifter politician) has fundamentally altered evolutionary selection in favor of parasitism. Liberals (at their core) are parasites, and their ideology and behavioral traits are secondary to the real harm this does to our species. We are now selecting for weakness.

        As have warned more than one Progressive. You are forcing this whole thing to “pick your tribe”.  And will not pick the tribe that promises the destruction of me and mine.  And my cultural tribe perfected the art of the blood feud, among  others things, so proceed at your own peril.

            Bingo.  I know, I know, if they could see obvious consequences they wouldn’t be liberals, but sheesh — if Whitey really is so evil, genocidal, etc., why the @#$# are you backing him into a corner?!?  Both Literally Hitler and everyone who stopped Literally Hitler was as white as mayo on wonderbread.  How many divisions do Disabled Lesbian Transsexuals of Colour have?

                Have been indulging my wishful thinking forecast of the coming of the overt “choosing of sides” event for quite some time now, looks like it’s actually happening.  I really couldn’t believe how far people let it go before the pushback started.“And will not pick the tribe that promises the destruction of me and mine.”I am actually glad that the pushback was able to start before the Gulag roundups began.  There is no doubt in my mind, and there hasn’t been for decades now, that the left is an existential threat and is driven by the BAMN mindset.  If they are not careful (and they are very obviously not) they will drive the creation of active RWDS right here in the good ole USA; that wouldn’t surprise me at all.  If we lose the left WILL try to round us up.When these things break open (when, not if) we will see how powerless the police truly are; we are seeing that already, and I continue to cite the 2014 New York cop targeted killings which resulted in the NYPD union issuing a standdown / two unit response order:https://mediachecker.wordpress.com/2014/12/21/breaking-cop-union-tells-nypd-to-arrest-only-when-necessary-stand-down/The political forces in play right now are unprecedented in my lifetime, and I was a teenager during Viet Nam, Kent State, Nixon, the SLA, FARC, MOVE, etc.  The violence was greater then but carried out by small and isolated groups (some supported or encouraged by underground left).  The potential for violence is far higher now IMO.  Instead of small “revolutionary” groups, we are separating into large angry factions, at least one of which is very heavily armed.We have former “intelligence” agency heads and political parties openly fomenting a coup against a popularly elected head of state.  “We the government” indeed.  It’s cliche by now but “this will not end well.”

        The alt-right is the first group to actively fight back against the left.  That means they are, so far, the only group to have a chance of surviving and prevailing in the culture wars against the left.
If you don’t fight, you can’t win.

        Kinda unfair hit on the Tea Party at the end there.  They are still around.  They were crushed under the political boot of the Obama administrations’ DOJ and IRS in cahoots with the GOPe.
The Tea Party was leaderless, a true grass roots movement, and was quickly subverted and manipulated by political hacks who deemed themselves leaders and set up organizations to take in money… all the while, mining data and gutting the movement.
It’s worthy of a book what happened.  And the Tea Party is directly responsible for the election of PDJT.

                They meant well, but I’ll be happy if I never again hear about how Tea Partiers picked up all their garbage after their rallies.  A bit of virtue signaling right there, I think, and it was about as useful as SJW virtue signaling.  The Deep State isn’t intimidated by clean sidewalks.

                    The “pick up the sidewalks” message wasn’t to the Deep State.  It was to those of us who take some pride in our almost-lost culture and manners.  It is saying that the people on our side all have each other’s backs covered, in big ways and small ones.  Picking up the trash is a small “taking care of the Homefront” act.

            What got Trump elected were all the folks the GOP and Tea party blew off – white blue collars and middle-class types in the Rust belt.
Trump actually talked to them and about the issues important to them.  The Tea Party never brought up any issues of a populist nature that Trump did.

                How exactly did the Tea Party blow off blue collar whitey?  Everyone I know in the Tea Party around here were white middle class, blue collar, disaffected Dems and Republicans and Independents.  Mostly Independents.   Weird you’d say that.

        Gavin McInnes and the alt-lite are also causing a split.  He told his Proud Boys to avoid looking alt-Right, probably because of the ADL.  But this is simply splitting them.More to the point, he and Chernovich made second class badthink people list anyway.  Cernovich is threatening to sue.  They don’t realize until they go full left rainbow feminist the left won’t leave them alone.This is the age of identity, and civ-nat isn’t one.

            They’re just a ramp to the alt-right.  I try not to counter-signal them.People talk about the red pill like it’s just one thing, but you actually get red-pulled in many steps.The Muslim Question is likely the most common of the red pills, but media question, the higher education question, the Jewish question, but the very last of them to be taken is the equality question.You are alt-right when you reject egalitarianism.  For some people this takes the form of monarchism or whatever and others think of Mussolini’s Italy or the Reich.  Others just imagine a meritocratic “caste” system.  Ultimately, as Americans, or rejection of egalitarianism, if it is not crushed, will encompass an American sense of fair play.But the RWDS will come first.

                When I started making fun of the Proud Boys, I started getting messages from people in it basically saying that most everyone in it is alt-right, but playing along in order to go to events. It’s hard to know, but I look at their social media and it looks like the Young Oath Keepers, with black guys and gays. I suspect that McInness started to be a fan club to promote his show and live events.
That said, McInness may be fluff, but he gets big numbers. Milo’s post-modern Liberace act has sold 100,000 books.

                    I would guess the more active members are alt-right, but who knows.  I just rely on him getting those big numbers of people to start rethinking the paradigm.
I guess just getting that ability to reject the old paradigm in the first place is actually the very first red pill

        I just have to tell this story. When I was in med school students had to take call for various services when on rotation. Whenever I was on call in the downtown trauma hospital I would hang around the surgery residents in the ER and they would let me sew up drunks. Later on they would recognize me and let me do some minor operations when the attending wasn’t in the OR. Got a head start on residency experience that way. One night a guy had come in after a failed suicide attempt and was ID’d as being wanted on several warrants as a member of the Outlaws motorcycle gang, so he was taken to the prison section of the ER and chained to a bed while still unconscious. The guy I was hanging out with heard about this and suggested we go over and have a peak. I got to examine him closely before he woke up. He had shot himself in the temple and happened to hit his sphenoid bone, which is one of the hardest bones in the body, and helps support the brainstem. (It also has very complicated anatomy. Once when lecturing on this structure, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr just stopped, confounded by trying to describe it, and simply said, “Gentlemen, God damn the sphenoid bone,” and went on to the next topic.) Anyhow, the shot bounced off and you could make out both the lower entrance wound and the upper exit. The cops said he had used a .32, and they figured he had tried to do himself in because he had been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa and was known to be going blind.Just then the guy started groggily waking up and opened his eyes. you could tell from the way his eyes searched about that everything was just lights and blur to him. No one said anything, but he probably picked up on the background noise and asked, “Am I alive?”  One of the residents answered “Yes”, and he looked like he was going to cry and said, “Shit. I can’t do anything right.”I called it a night.

                Actually, I’m pretty sure that it has always been “this way”, and that the problems start when we drift or are pushed away from it.“An old money guy, in contrast, counter-signals by living in an old farmhouse that has been in the family for generations and driving a 40 year old Saab. He’s the sort of rich that feels no need to advertise it.”I’ve always wanted to be the richest guy that nobody had ever heard of. Imagine you’re the 10,000th richest person on Earth. More money than you could spend in a lifetime, I’m guessing. The only thing fame is good for is that it can often be converted into wealth, IMHO.

Sooner of later, even the most virtuous symbols get hijacked by radicals,nut jobs, and someone looking to make a buck, polluting its original meaning and intent, and coloring you by association.I am not ashamed by the the proper display American flag, but when people wear it as a bandana or scarf or such thing, or use the flag itself in their protest or flying off a pole from the back of their pick-up truck, then I see the fulfillment of the homily that the last resort of the scoundrel is to wrap the flag around themselves to appear patriotic. I need no visual broadcasting of my opinions upon my body. I will not be someone’s advertising billboard. My actions will speak for me, period, as a individual with a free will and my own mind, and not as a shill for someone else. I will not be pigeonholed by political or social fashion.

            Some of us wear it as camouflage. I live in a blue state. I’m a Trump supporter. I wear Birkenstocks because I have arthritis in my feet and they make me look like a liberal. Sometimes you just want to blend in.

            I have always wondered what women are thinking with the tattoo thing.  From comments on various sites, I see two sorts of responses, all from men.  The first is basically “ew”.  Unattractive, weird, off-putting.  The second is “this one is easy”, and “nice for one or two nights is all”, and “great romp in the sack material, but you better run away from any longer term relationship with her”.  Yet the women with tattoos seem to be signaling “I’m a tough, brave one” to their female peers.Seriously, what guy wants to have anything to do with a woman wearing a “tramp stamp” above her butt, for longer than half an hour or so?

                I have a tattoo and the only people that get to see it are my husband and my doctor. And I got it when I was 59. I really can’t stand the look of young women with full sleeves and tattoos on their chest (like the gal in American Pickers). And I don’t understand folks that get commemorative tattoos. I guess my point is that tattoos have to be visible to count as signaling.

        Precisely as always Zman.  Vox Day has penned the 16 points of the Alt-Right:
http://voxday.blogspot.com/2016/08/what-alt-right-is.html
This is number 14:
“The Alt Right believes we must secure the existence of white people and a future for white children.”
If not the sole purpose the main purpose of including that point is to keep out anyone emotionally committed to the old system.

            Those 16 points have immense value in a world where everyone has a place, and that place is the one that reflects each person’s heritage and culture.  The Left has taught people that they don’t have a place in the world, unless they seize it from someone else.  They have also taught people that the world is a series of scams, and you had better generate or join the scam that takes care of you.  Finally, they have taught people that government is the biggest, most powerful scam of all, and one should get on the right side of government and leverage government to one’s own benefit.  Alt-right appears to me to simply be a repudiation of all of this.  This repudiation of the Leftist world view is what makes it so powerful and threatening.This all goes back to the producer-parasite thing.  The Leftist parasites see the Rightist producers taking up their own cause (finally), and the parasites are wetting their pants in fear.  The parasite scams are in danger, as the alt-right begins to fully understand the scope and manner of the scams, and is now initiating the political process of tearing them all down.

            “The Alt Right believes we must secure the existence of white people and a future for white children.”More cut-n-paste from Stormfront and VNN. The alt-white monkeys do not even have original ideas. Now, they are thumping their little boy-chests since they think Trump win validates their crap. WRONG.Trump’s win does not validate white nationalist garbage anymore than Obama’s win was a validation of Black Panther’s militant racism.Say what you want about the Tea Party at least the TP resulted in GOP house control in 2010 and kinda stopped O from further carrying out his hope-n-dope. Otherwise Mr. Hopey Changey would have brought back the 1994 AWB. Name ONE political accomplishment from the alt-white losers, just one. No, cross burnings in the 1960s do not count.

                You are giving the Tea Party a lot of credit for votes they had no influence over whatsoever. In case you missed it somewhere along the line people tend to be individual agents.In case anyone was wondering, I chose this moniker out of respect for the spirit of tea partiers and not because I was one myself. I just needed a pseudonym for disqus and this sounded good.

        The white guys club was always an open one, and anyone was always welcome, people of color or women.  One of the old tenets was that you knew your place in the white guys club, and didn’t abuse the club privileges.  You all were part of a team.Pro football was a classic example.  Great players like Johnny Unitas just shut up and played.  Then Joe Namath, of all people, blew open the door.  He got cocky, adopted the pimp-black dressing and personal behavior signals, and wore the white shoes on the field.  It opened the door for all the crappy behavior you see today.Wall Street, for all of its rapacious plundering of the rest of us, has stayed a white guys club, one of the last of them.  Shut up, dress well, do your work, and behave.  Play your part, and you get a cut of the action.  Act like a cocky young asshole, and you get run out the door.

        The internet has provided a battlefield for engagement in thought wars.  Symbols are powerful cultural signifiers used to create boundaries and challenge opponents.  Ironically,  bots are banner carriers in some of these wars while trolls are employed as saboteurs.  IQ is the nuclear force that determines the outcome and the extent of the fallout.  I much prefer this kind of warfare than a mushroom cloud in my backyard (in my case, DC).

        But – is the alt-right ‘racist’?I don’t see it, unless we call a spade a spade and start referring to wanks like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson as ‘racists’. Being honest about racial realities is not racist. Blacks do have lower IQ’s, they are more violent, and they can’t govern themselves, much less anyone else. As one of my favourite bloggers says: Mokita.Also a point about the bikers, Z-Man: the tired old trope of the scarred, anti-social beardo with a hog, a MAC 10 in one saddle bag and a kilo of coke in the other is fodder for the morons of Hollywood. Today you will see gang members in immaculately tailored three piece suits. Or busting their ass on the job in a hard hat. Or passing out toys for needy kids at Christmas time. They’re in the banks, the cop shop and the coffee shop and they are into anything that’ll make ’em a buck. They are very successful in legitimate business too.I think what you are seeing with the alt-right today is a proto-movement. People are sick to fuckin’ death of the classic virtue signals of the left, and the lunacy that goes along with it – and they’ve had enough. Nobody (other than maybe, Vox Day) can even define the alt-right. I agree the Tea Party was the foundation for the Alt-Right – but beyond that I think this is a transitory movement that is going to morph into something a lot meaner and nastier and more willing to oppose the left in whatever court they want to play in.Interesting times are in the offing.

            Soap box, ballot box, jury box, cartridge box.We’re finally using the soap box, and that’s got the left pissed.We need to work better on the ballot box.  The soap box will help that.  We need to get more news out about fraudulent Democrat voting.  Not that the Democrats care – to rile up the Republican base that we need to swim in.We also need to get more into the jury box.  Let’s be honest – the federal judiciary is almost entirely leftist.  We need to fix that.  That takes the ballot box and the balls to start impeaching judges in job lots.We practically own the cartridge box.  We can hope we don’t need it, but I really don’t see the leftists giving up on their dreams of power when they’re this close to finally achieving ultimate power.

                Spot on Chuck.The progs are in an interesting dilemma: they may hate us bible clinging gun toting red neck hicks with the heat of 1000 suns… but the military and most rank and file law officers hate them right back. Hell, even upper echelon law officers are in revolt and speaking openly about gun control and black crime and other taboo subjects the left doesn’t want discussed. Classical socialist behaviour means corrupting the military and law enforcement and using them as thugs for the govt… but that will never happen in today’s America. You will see civil war first.I see two futures: the progs will dry up and blow away like so much old dog shit, never to be heard from again. Trump is already taking the trash out by kicking  the trannies and sexually disturbed head cases out of the military. I suspect the queers are next if they want to get stupid about it. The Donks have to see that they’ve lost the common man and will need to dispense with lunacy to get them back.The other option is a short, nasty race and civil war that nobody wins and everyone loses. After which the usual suspects will prattle about ‘never again’ and ‘lest we forget’.

        I can’t say much about the alt-right, but let me secondCodes of the Underworld.It’s one of thoseMoneyballtype books, where you read it and go “no duh!”  And then you wonder why you never saw it, why nobody else saw it, how people whose job depends on seeing it never saw it (in fact refuse to see it).  There needs to be a better name for it, but nothing’s more valuable than “no duh!” literature.

        The left still owns the media and will  continue to ratchet up the rhetoric.It’s kept whitey scared till now, why won’t it keep working ?  Speak out and  the government spy residing in your home ( wife, parents, children ) will  turn you in for ” your own safety “.Even that sympathetic neighbor you think is on ” your side ” will turn you over to government agents for all the crazy talk.No, a successful movement will require a lot more than signaling to have a successful chance of opposing the left.Even if kept secret there will always be that one individual to undermine any serious alt-right  movement. It’s why we have been unsuccessful so far. White people can’t stay together.Germany , France , Sweden  all have horrible problems with so-called refugees, yet the killings and rapes continue. Will we really ever fight back  ?

        You guys seem to forgot that People of Color reject your philosophy and in fact hate it with a passion.Read Leonard Pitts and verysmartbrothas to see what People of Color think of white identity politicshttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/protests-against-removing-confederate-monuments-are-not-really-about-history/2017/05/12/8d2905d8-3732-11e7-b4ee-434b6d506b37_story.html?utm_term=.4bb2ed080aebIn the current moment, many Americans find themselves gripped by what some have termed “cultural anxiety.” Nearly two-thirds of white  Americans believe that the country’s culture and way of life have deteriorated in recent decades.  There’s no escaping that it’s still a question of roles, standing and hierarchy.  A wish to maintain a social structure that prefers one group over the rest. It’s discomfiting to feel that you have lost power as others have gained equal footing, even if you were never entitled to dominance in the first place.The future is People of Color. The future is equality. GET USED TO ITAlso, this has been tried in Rhodesia and South Africa. It didn’t work then and it will not work now. There will be no “revolution”. Most alt -righters are childless single men. More and more white girls are dating marrying Men of Color and bearing Children of Color

            LOL.   So the future is “equality” .Can we (finally) shut off the welfare payments then,  since we’re all equal now?The threats of violence and outright hatred coming out of “people of color” – are one of the big reasons why the alt-right has gained so much traction over the last few years.  It’s plainly obvious at this point – that we’re NOT going to go skipping off into the future singing Kumbaya with our “colored” brethren.  We’ve been attempting it for quite a few decades now – and it hasn’t gotten any better.If we’re going to throw links around – I’ll chuck this one out:https://voxday.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-cost-of-black-america.htmlThe money quote:Over the course of an average 79-year lifespan, a white individual contributes a net $220,805 to the system, whereas over the course of an average 75-year lifespan, a black individual receives a net $751,200. However, since there are 4.6 times more whites than blacks in the USA, the black share has to be divided among the various contributors to sort out a one-to-one comparison.——-“Equal” means support your own damn ass.You’re picking the wrong comparisons if you want to try and equate Rhodesia and South Africa to the US.  Both of them were white MINORITY countries, where the whites came in and subjugated (if you want to use that term) the colored natives. Then – in large part because of political pressure from outside – those white MINORITIES decided to give up power.It hasn’t worked out so well for them.Everything I have read coming out of the alt-right , leads me to believe that in general – the alt-right is WELL AWARE of this fact.

                Say what you will about the white colonizers, basically almost all of the people, in most of the countries that ran their white overlords out of the country, have suffered ever more greatly ever since.
This is especially true where the average IQ is a whole lot lower than the average white IQ.  In places with a reasonably high IQ, non-white indigenous rule seems to work out mostly pretty well.

            Wow.  Blacks are so abysmally stupid as to think they are a majority in America.  Wake up, Trent.  We whites outnumber you here by six to one.  And we have the guns, the training, and the discipline.  Oh, and all the money, most of the property and businesses, the personnel of the military and law enforcement organizations, etc.
America is not South Africa.  We’ve seen what happens when you let the blacks take over the government – white genocide, then black poverty and starvation.  We’re not letting it happen here.  You have to go.  Not us.
