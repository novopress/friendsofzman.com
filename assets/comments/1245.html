        I agree wholeheartedly with your article. Due to realignment of Congressional Districts she now has a contingent of educated middle class conservatives.  Unfortunately votes to put this person down. I have written two pieces about the stupid comments she makes whenever she gets in front of an audience. She is an embarrassment to the State of Texas. Her district reaches from the Heights in near downtown Houston almost to Montgomery County 22 miles to the North in The Woodlands, TX. She needs to go.  Thanks for your article. (Her district ends 1/4 of a mile from my home in Spring, TX.)

        People should be required to pass a test in order to vote. But the bigger question – until smart drugs become more mainstream and affordable – is what to do with all the below average folks in an Average is Over world. Especially since we keep raising the bar with respect to what one needs to do to earn a middle class living. Idiocracy is coming.
