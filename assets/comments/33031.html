        Hopefully the RFK Jr pick sticks and he applies the wrecking ball to the pharmaceutical industry.
It is impossible to be too cynical about Big Pharma. Those corporations are straight from some cyberpunk dystopia novel, as we all saw during the panic of 20-21. If he can shove a large object up Pfizer’s ass and break it off, that alone will be worth the incoming Zionism.

            There is going to be an enormous amount of money flowing into the campaign coffers of Senators from Pharma.  His confirmation won’t be a lock.  GOP Senators are easily purchased.
If he does get confirmed (I think he will, eventually), I bet the TV ads are the first thing to go.

                TV ad’s are one thing.  Vaccine regime recommendations are another, and the more important aspect of the problem (IMHO).  The reason why is that State/school mandates for children attending public, or any schooling, follow such slavishly.  It also doesn’t help that mothers are inherently stupid in this regard and allow their pediatrician to begin to administer such within *hours* of birth.My granddaughter for example received a “hepatitisB” shot after being born but only a few hours old.  My exclamation was “are you insane”, but I was quickly shushed.  This process needs to be exposed and shut down.Here is an excerpt from ChatGPT illustrating such axiomatic shot regimen:”By 4-6 years old, children will have received about 20-25 shots, depending on whether catch-up vaccines or additional recommendations (e.g., Hepatitis A or COVID-19) are followed.”Last I checked, by 18 yo an American had a regimen of 42 shots.I leave the list of vaccine types and diseases out as such is not necessary for my point.Disclaimer: I have “voluntarily” received vaccinations; flu, shingles, polio, tetanus, smallpox, etc.  Never Covid. Even a couple for tropical diseases, but never at the age and rate given today, nor without some thought as to consequences of ineffective and unnecessary vaccinations at a young age.  And yes, I had every childhood disease known—and survived as did all other friends at that time.

                    We didn’t know much about vaccines until the last couples of years.  My wife is currently pregnant, there is no way they will be giving our baby a vaccine for Hepatitis B when you can only get it through sex and intravenous drug use.  We are going to review them all to see what is truly beneficial. Wish we would have done it differently for our other children.

                        I go by experience. My youngest has never been vaccinated, and she is one of the brightest, sweetest, healthiest kids in the elementary school. When they wanted to inject her, upon birth, with hep B, I said, as the Lord is my witness, after they insisted twice, “That shot only has an efficacy of a dozen years; I doubt she will be banging drugs or dudes in primary school.”

                            The “cure” for Polio is what got everybody to jump on the vaccine bandwagon. If vaccines can prevent polio, it can prevent anything!

                                Polio was “topped off” in the mid seventies by the eradication of Smallpox via vaccination.  About that time we started to get push back from some advanced thinkers wrt vaccinations.  We need to discuss this issue in light of the low point of mRNA technology and Covid vax.

                        Traditional jabs are nothing more than a very specific form of state-sanctioned homeotherapy of varying value.
Flu jabs are a joke because they base the formulation on flu season in Australia, which lags ours by six months. Anyone that has passed middle school biology should understand why doing so is dumb and a complete wate of time.
The coof shots are something different and far more dangerous. It appears to be some kind of genetic therapy cranked up to 11, versus a gene therapy like Humira which has very specific, mostly beneficial effects.

                        My wife just had our boy 4.5 weeks early and the hospital was trying to give him a hepatitis shot the second day he was out, still hooked up to oxygen and a tube. I told them I don’t think he will be sharing needles or having unprotected sex so no. All the nurses were wonderful but it’s scary how brainwashed everyone in medicine is.

                    The most important part is the vaccine immunity (how ironic) they have.  Vaccine related illnesses cannot be taken to court. They have total immunity and a special court that handles these vaccine lawsuits.

                        It’s not quite total legal immunity, but the bar is much higher than the simple negligence that it is for any other product. It so high that it’s difficult to find a lawyer willing to take the almost certain loss, and will advise you take the payout from the vaccine fund.

                    As I understand it, HepB should have been one of those jabs offered depending on socio-economic conditions. If someone in the family has HepB, it may not be a bad idea, particularly if they are not clean freaks. It’s mostly useful for poor immigrants packed many to a house. Especially those who still have 3rd world standards for hygiene.

                        “HepB should have been one of those jabs offered depending on socio-economic conditions. “There is no argument here.  I am *not* antivax.  I am pro-choice wrt vaccines and against government mandates.  Let everyone decide and choose for they and theirs.  But this choice must be made with informed consent.  Something not promoted in the area of vaccination these days.What we have too much of—ignoring those rapacious Pharma companies for the moment—are a bunch of do gooders in the Leftist medical establishment.  They know better than you do wrt your and your neighbor’s health choices.Take HPV vaccine.  Another one that is pushed upon young girls because uterus cancer.  You contract HPV through sexual contact with others who have poor decision making skills in that area.  The Lefties also now insist upon young males taking the vaccine as well—the better to prevent them from infecting their daughter.This never ends, but is understandable if you consider yourself and your children as belonging to a large farm co-op—and they are the farmer who owns you, the livestock.  Hell, they even “un-ashamedly” use the term “herd Immunity” to describe their efforts.  Unfortunately, they reserve the right require you to risk your health through adverse reactions in order to assuage their risk (fear) of contracting the disease.

                    My two autistic sons (now adults) received the Hep B vaccine on the day of their birth. This was done without our knowledge because there was some clause in the admission forms we signed that allowed them to do this. At that time, the vaccine contained a big slug of both mercury and aluminum, both neurotoxic, with aluminum also being a potent pro-inflammatory substance.

                        Sorry to hear it, man. We checked out instead of letting them be taken out of our sight. We did get a few of the vaccinations at the pediatrician that were “required”, but not many. A couple more than I would have done now, for sure. Maybe just smallpox, and then only from a single-dose ampule that don’t have those preservatives, like they do for the elite.
I’m all in favor of taking all those bastards who hide behind those sneaky clauses, and roasting them over a very slow fire.

                            If the populace sentiments change, then the Courts can bring the justice you seek. Many now hold such agreements invalid due to many reasons/interpretations. One common one is signature/agreement under duress. I think your wife being in labor and dropping the kid out in the street—unless you sign here *is* the common definition of duress to any thinking person. Therefore shooting up you baby because you signed a multi-page admission agreement will not prevent them from a malpractice suit.

                        Sorry to hear that. There is no death too painful for those who hide behind those “admission forms” they make you sign. “Just following orders” is no excuse. You deserve informed consent.

                    I often joke (acknowledging a bit of wry undeserved reality) that I am the “new man” formed by harsh Darwinian selection for the 21st century.My diet is complete shit—and has been since childhood. I drink. I’ve had just about every disease in childhood, but few in adulthood. Prior to Covid, not even the seasonal cold. Went through university and beyond. I remain at fit weight without effort and diet. And so forth. Everyone around me seems to drop dead or are invalided at my age. Crippled often to the level of debility.Indeed, I should be cloned for the betterment of future generations. Wife hates me however. She’s been fighting everything that befalls a modern American since we met. 😉

                I suspect the establishment will fight the RFK nod with greater ferocity than even Gaetz. The American medical system is one of the few gifts out there that can rival the military industrial complex in scope.
Getting rid of the ads would be a very good start. It’s embarrassing to be one of only two countries on Earth that allows drug dealers to pimp their wares to kids watching Sesame Street.

                    “Forced out” could be this year’s “without evidence.”As with Trump, the whole government takes Gaetz’sbeing aroundas a personal affront. He seems like a standard issue “Christian right” creep to me. He even fulfilled the sacred rite of bachelor orphan purchase. But he’s their nemesis for some reason. I guess he offends some crucial bit of etiquette that outsiders don’t know. To maintaintheirborder, they’ll go however wild is necessary. What they’ve already done to him is insane, and we don’t even remember it. He’s a great opportunity to “flex on” Trump (and us), as the kids used to say.RFK also seems obviously useful to the bad guys. Where he differs with the establishment he also differs with Trump, whose deference to success/bigness is his Achilles heel. The right kind of press/industry campaign could screw up their relationship in a way that “discredits”whatever. They could scandal-ize Kennedy in a way that convinces Trump tosign right hereon full pharma regs applied to health food, for example. It ends howevertheydecide.The above assumes regime thoughtfulness. By all appearances, they’re reacting to Gaetz and RFK with stupid tantrums. But it’s thechildren of the palacehaving those tantrums. What fraction of the system serves only to soothe them? Half? All but the banks and tanks? Enough.

            RFK is an interesting figure. If his voice were better, and a bug had not eaten some of his brain, and the Democrats didn’t ostracize him, he could’ve been 2024’s Bernie Sanders.
Half of the online right likes him (because he was a Democrat anti-vaxxer and joined the Trump Train) and half dislikes him (because he is, in many ways, still a Democrat).
Normally I wouldn’t like him but in this day and age, being a rebel is good enough for me.

                    Yep, RFK Jr is a “loon”—but he’s our loon!  😉
He’s a package.  Some good, some bad.  I’m thinking we need him to shake up the industry.  Pre-Covid, I’d have not said this, after Covid nothing too bad/outlandish can be said about the Health Care system we have in this country.  We need to break folks out of their stupor.  The medical field is not your friend.  Your doctor is not “god”.  Your typical doctor is little more than a technician, not Dr. Science like Fauci!

                        I personally am taking all my doctor’s recommendations with skepticism.  I don’t trust them nor the tests they use to make those recommendations.  Just like the covid tests were suspect, I think much of the tests (blood tests) run by labs are likely to be suspect  Most cancer treatment prescribed is likely unhelpful (see Bollinger’s Truth about Cancer).  High cholesterol treatment (statins) is erroneous. When there is any hint of a ‘cold’ of flu, I take vitamins C, D, K, quercetin, zinc and iodine.  First choice for a catch all medication is Ivermectin.  This has obviated the need for prescription medication and doctor visits.

Not sure why the downvotes.  I think I got you back to zero.
I will not get between you and your doctor, but I for one *do* argue with my doctor and *did* reject (further) cancer treatment and *am* alive after 5 years.  No, I did not take exotic herbs or other “alternative” treatments.  I simply demanded an explanation of the procedure recommended and a best guess of recovery without such.
This is simple critical thinking.  You all have good minds here, use them.

                            I don’t know if I related this recently, but a few months ago, I went to my cardiologist for a routine follow up.Upon reviewing my test results, he noticed that my cholesterol had dropped by half. His eyes grew wide and he asked,”do you know why that is”?I feigned ignorance and said,”No”.”Because your on the best statin drug on the planet”!I didn’t have the heart to tell him that I had never taken the prescription in the three years I have been going to him. I actually read the side effects.Lost 57 pounds, changed my diet and gave up sugar. It wasn’t that hard.

                RFK Jr. is, on some issues, to the far left of even current (recent) Democrat loons. Nevertheless, he has a well-established track record as vaccine skeptic among other issues. It was a masterstroke for Trump to ally himself with such a prominent “anti-vaxxer” and now proposes to make him HHS Secretary. Trump (or his advisors) shrewdly rewarded an ally yet place him in a position where his influence is limited to health policy. I suspect his approval will be difficult, but I wish the man luck. The current medical-industrial complex has a lot to answer for and I know I speak for probably half the country when I say I’d like to see some major reforms. Whether we’ll get them is an open question, but 2025 onward will be fascinating to watch.

I believe RFK will get in via recess appointment.
Doing a 180 in the HHS leadership is too important for him not too. His visibility and family name are other reasons to get him in.
I also think that this appointment is as close as we will ever get to a public admission from Trump that there is something wrong with the coof jabs and he screwed up trying to rush them out.

            I think everyone is missing the point. Trump very likely had far more of the national vote than was “recorded”. He has a TRUE mandate, from a country of people NOW more politically engaged than ever before, due to horrific necessity created by the folks who have totally infiltrated our gov, our schools, our media, etc. The vast majority of the country wants these evil mofos gone forever.The MSM is dead, Trump will use the new media like no president before him, the RINO’s will have no place to hide if they try ANYTHING. Thr Republican party will be washed clean of RINO’s within a few years, as policy and not cult of personality will prevail.This also means that Trump and his Knights of the Round Table also will have their feet put to the fire if THEY start saying one thing and doing another. Personally not worried about that, IMO this is the Dream Team, not Bird MJ and Magic.Interesting times to be sure.

                “He has a TRUE mandate, …”… and then there is what’s behind the mandate: a slowly but steadily spreading delegitimization of the entire socio-econo-political system. There are many names for post-America, AINO, Anal-Empire, the GAE, and Weimerica. The latter, a contraction of Weimar and America, is highly appropriate.The Weimar Republic in Germany preceded the rise of the mustachioed corporal  and was characterized by uniform loathing of the ‘republic’ all across the political spectrum. Right and left of all flavors and gradations hated the WR. It’s only support was the ~20% of the population living off tax expenditures. Every one else wanted the damn thing gone, the various factions just disagreed on with what to replace it.Support inside America for the current regime, whether from real or paperwork Americans, is a function of how much remuneration is coming their way. Many of our diversities, and I have seen several vids of various African-“Americans” making this explicit, are not happy at seeing the gibs that they are robbing from Americans being taken from them and given to other immivaders. Real Americans, of course, are tired of being robbed by everyone else. It was one thing when there were 9 whites carrying one black in 1950. Most people probably didn’t even realize they were being fleeced. Being a hated and harvested minority in 2024 is facing civilizational destruction.The regime has its work cut out for it keeping the cash flow to their supporters going while reforming the financial system to avoid debt collapse while maintaining control. Regime oligarch deals with Pres. Trump, whether explicit or implicit, should be seen from their interest in shoring up a clearly collapsing system. The best thing for Americans and other Europeans would be wild success in the deportation operation and failure in everything else, because Weimerica must still die for European people to live.

            Good observations. Purely by coincidence, I’m currently listening to William Gibson’s iconic “cyberpunk” novelNeuromancer(which I think defined the (sub)genre). All the more appropriate it’s narrated by a computer voice. As with any such novel, there is some kinky sex, but none so far similar to your proposal.

            If you look at priorities, Z is right. Israel is subordinate to the Forever War against Russia. Yes, Neocons to a person support Israel, but that is their secondary concern. The best example is the Neocon-promoted bombing of Serbia. Benefits to Israel were tangential–maybe a little good will from the Saudis, for example–but it was a real punch to Russia’s gut. Even before the Bolshevik Revolution, American Jewry was lobbying for economic boycotts of the Czar. Some of them actually were anti-Zionist largely for religious reasons but all of them were gestating Neocons.

                Bolshevism was a heavily Jewish movement, and it received major support from American Jewry through WWII. The Stalin purges were the turning point, and the  1967 Six Day War was the decisive moment, when World Jewry turned harshly against the USSR, e.g., the mass emigration of Jews from the USSR to Israel and the West in the 1970’s and 1980’s.The collapse of the USSR and the rise of  Putin’s Russia did nothing to assuage the hatred Jews had developed for Russia, and that hatred is central to the war in Ukraine (and likely contributed to the bombing of Serbia as well).People, including Jews, and desire and work for two things at the same time, and Ukraine is a perfect example. Israel is, of course, the most important thing, but Ukraine sits at the heart of the Pale of Settlement, and the ancestors of many of the most bloodthirsty neoconservative Jews hail from that area (from southern Lithuania through Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine).I’m convinced that one of the main drivers of the war, beyond punishing Russia and Putin, is reclaiming their ancestral homelands in Eastern Europe. You can see another vector of this in Jewish attempts to reclaim the homes in Poland that they claim belonged to their ancestors prior to WWII.

                    Much agree, fighting for dominance between factions has always been the way for…everyone, really.
“Khazars” versus “Hebrews” versus “Americans”, in this case, each concerned most with drug sales on his own street corner.

                    Lol. You assert that the motivation for the Iraq war, etc., was “anti Russia,” and cite lack of US action against Saudi Arabia as evidence. Saudi Arabia is, behind the scenes and somewhat awkwardly, an ally with Israel against Iran. Sure, Russia sides against “us” in the Middle East, but “us” does not equal “the US,” rather “us” equals Israel and the “Amen Corner” in our government. (ht/ P. Buchanan). Our actions in Iraq , Syria, etc., and our inaction in Palestine, are first and foremost in support of our “greatest ally.” The “Project for a New American Century” and the “Clean Break” report were about Israel, not Russia, and I’m sure you know that. Why you insist on  gaslighting your readers on these issues is less clear to me. I guess you aren’t quite ready to cross to “this side,” and “polite society” still has a hook in you…

            Without the Christian Zionist component, the lobby would be considerably less powerful. The GOP is dependent on the votes of these loonies.

        I think we would have had a much greater chance for nuclear war with the Neocons empowered by Kamala than with Trump doing Israel’s bidding. The Russians—as you’ve pointed out—have developed a weird pos- Cold war complex about lying and bluffing. Putin made this clear when he signed the order that would send missiles downrange if certain laws of war were transgressed by the Ukrainians. The decision was completely out of his hands. His statement was translated as something along the lines of, “We’ll go to heaven as martyrs and the West will go to hell as the people who destroyed the world.” He didn’t sound like he was kidding.The Middle East has a much weirder and oriental way of seeing and doing things. There’s a lot of what self-defense expert Rory Miller called “the monkey dance,” going on. This is where two guys, probably drunk, get angry and start trading insults. The hope is that someone steps in to break it up and they’re allowed to save face. The Israelis and Iranians are much more likely to just keep skirmishing like this than stepping it all the way up.Trump doesn’t have to do too much at this point to make me happy. Deporting the barbarians and defunding the neocons will be just peachy. He’s already accomplished his most important goal—from my perspective—just by becoming president again. The pollsters, pundits, and celebrities—and more importantly the “expert class—who constantly hector and moralize the rest of us have just been smacked hard in the face. Yes it happened before and they came back, but they took some time off, and now it looks like they’re going to be sitting there with that dumbfounded look on their face for longer this time.If this were boxing, last time they would have gotten saved by the ref and TKO’d. This time they got hit so hard they woke up in their dressing room, asking their trainer what time the fight happens. I don’t want to think about what their gloat would have been like if they’d won, or your average normal white person’s despair and rage would have been like. The silence from Michael Moore and Rob Reiner right now is a thing of beauty, something I savor like a condemned man’s last cigarette on the scaffold before he’s to be hanged.Trump, just by persevering like this, has sort of reenchanted the world, if only for one noncynical moment. He pulled off a miraculous comeback, instantiated the mythic archetype of the comeback, like something out of “The Count of Monte Cristo.” And men live by myths. Ultimately he shut everyone’s mouths, including those who backed him but doubted him, as I occasionally did.

            Putin laid out his country’s nuke use plan in at least one presentation that I watched.  It seemed quite reasonable.  Basically, he rejects the formal USA policy of withstanding a first attack and retaliation, yet does not state that any use of nukes starts a full blown nuke war with all that entails.  However, the opposite side of the coin is that such use will most likely open the theater to tactical nuke use and that is dangerous wrt escalation as Russian will not stand idly by to receive a 1st nuke strike on homeland.  He noted that those provinces fought over are now *Russian*.  The Ukrainian theater is way too close to Moscow to do much soul searching wrt nuke use.

                With the Russian policy on nukes as it is, it amazes me that the Ukraine would bleat about developing nukes or even dirty bombs. Although seeing them in action the last few years, I’ve come to see that they may just be the stupidest people on earth with a giant death wish. That whole region would glow in the dark if they even used one dirty bomb.

I don’t disagree.
However, I see Bibi as a highly dangerous, potentially unhinged factor in the ME mess.
I mean, the guy has been near or at the top of the Israeli power structure for over 40 years and he just can’t seem to walk away into retirement.
This implies he sees power as a sort of drug and that he is not going to give his favorite drug up willingly.
I won’t be surprised if he does something really insane in the next few months to try and widen the ME conflict.

        Most folks are ambivalent about Israel, but the hatred of the FBI is universal.  The CIA is probably just as corrupt, but they aren’t breaking into folks homes at night, shooting their dogs, dragging people onto the lawn in their underwear for the cameras.
[How, in the name of all that is holy,  did they get a law passed that says they can arrest people for “lying to the FBI”, while the FBI does nothing but lie to the citizens and their elected representative?]

        A lot of people on our side of the divide are hot and bothered over Trump foreign policy team being filled with Israel firsters. Well, that was going to happen no matter what. So long as we stay out of some big war, who cares.
What matters is the US. Trump looks to be very tough on immigration, bringing the FBI under control and chopping away for the managerial class in various other ways. If he do any of those things, much less all three, it’s a huge win for our side. Take the win.

            The den of subhuman scum aka the senate will defend the FBI harder than it defends the military. The military is just a tool of empire, while the FBI is their personal police force. Trump will reform it over their politically dead bodies. IOW he won’t. Their control over it is ironclad (or is that its control over them?), you saw who Trump’s last FBI director appointment was even after he had fired the prior one for corruption. This is also why they can’t allow the Gaetz nomination to proceed. The permanent regime, to exist, requires control of the DOJ, since a DOJ out of its control can be turned against it. Whereas they can let most other agencies go for periods of time, knowing they can re-corral them later.

                You danced around it:  The senate does not control the FBI.  The FBI is a rogue agency that does whatever it wants.  The senate is scared of the FBI, that’s why they will go to the mat for them.  Susan Collins doesn’t want her dog shot and her underwear drawer rifled through.

                    Presumably, someone is in charge of the FBI. It’s inaccurate to say that “it” does whatever it wants. There is a person, or people, with names and faces, who run this thing. It’s just as plausible, arguably even more plausible, that it’s senior senators running it as anyone else. Even if it’s not them, it’s somebody. Somebody who isn’t the president. Obviously it’s not the director, since changing him makes no difference. Even if it’s some shadowy Soros type figure controlling it, he would still have no choice but to exercise a great deal of that control, probably most of it, through the senate. So whether or not it actually is in charge of the FBI, the senate is still a choke point that must be coerced and/or negotiated with by anyone who does seek to control the FBI.

                        I agreed fully with you until this point. The FBI and ICarethede factogovernment of the United States at this point. Senators serve them. This has been the case since Hoover and the Brothers Dulles. We’ll see if either the IC or FBI can be neutered or dismantled from within the system they control; I’m skeptical. The green shoot from this cycle, though, has been the emergence of a rogue elite who also are afraid but want the IC/FBI checked. That will prove at best to be a heavy lift but this emerging elite is very bright. It may come down to pitting the IC and FBI against one another, for example.Changing the demographics of the United States is the primary goal of the FBI/IC junta, and that’s the whole ball of wax. It will be interesting to see how they respond to that being slowed let alone whether they themselves can be destroyed. Again, I’m skeptical but don’t fully discount it can be done although if anything were to prompt a civil war that would be it.

Well, other than all that has been tried so far is replace the old director with one of his clones. The answer will have to be sought outside those who live at FBI HQ.
If it were me, I’d task someone to look long and hard at those whistleblowers who got fired for exposing FBI corruption.

                        Who has Trump nominated for the DOJ?The FBI is under their purview, isn’t it?Also, the chokepoints are the inspectors general for each department.  Right now they’re loyalists, a part of each agency and defending it, what they must be made is seperate and independent, as Sundance recommends.The control node for the entire ‘silo’ system- autonomous silos, operating outside the Executive’s authority, gone rogue that is, is in the Senate.Again, Sundance at Conservative Treehouse has done an exhaustive study on the structure and key positions and committees; I would defer to him to be best informed.(Although most of his audience are Scofield Christians, he readily expresses grave concerns as he too would like to stay out of WWIII.  Trump’s initial picks pending confirmation are all Third Temple fanatics.)

                            I did upvote because you are mostly right, though you seem to not understand dispensationalism. Dispensations by name date back to at least the 1100s, and, if you read the book of Acts, it’s already a prominent concept at the time of the original Disciples. They had already broached the idea that the rules of yesterday no longer applied to Christians of the day. Indeed, consider what Acts 11 means when it says “Christian” was first applied to the “believers” at Antioch.

        Speaking as a 20yr Soldier with 4 GWOT  tours here. Pete Hegseth is an excellent choice for SECDEF because he knows exactly where the ideological changes in the DoD need to happen (specifically, the ADUSs). Management of the military itself falls greatly on the service chiefs and secretaries, and Hegseth will know the trustworthy ones from this proposed review board.I, and ALL of my friends, have been broken hearted at what has been done to our military’s spirit. Hegseth is the right guy to reignite the warrior ethos.PS: It will be hilarious watching the general officer corps try to make up for years of kissing the wrong asses.

            All well and good, but there’s still the more fundamental question of what is the purpose of the military?
Making the US military better just so it can fight pointless wars for Israel and the neocons more effectively isn’t exactly a win.

                Correct. I would much rather the military be an ineffective mess. The best case scenario is they go and kill muslims on behalf of the jews, the more likely worst case scenario is they shoot at me and mine one of these days. I sincerely hope the US military becomes 100 percent transexual blacks. That would make doing what needs to be done when the time comes much easier.

                    Yes.  A less effective military would be a good thing in the long run.  That’s why I am not opposed to women in combat.  It makes the military weaker to have women in the combat arms and it might have added bonus of making it harder to use them due to some old fashioned concern for women.  The concern is probably not likely as the old fashioned traditional males dies out in our society though.  Anything to have less idiotic wars of the type we have been fighting in, especially the most recent.

                                Jews play hardball. It’s best to think of them as an ethnic mob. A very smart and sophisticated ethnic mob, but a mob all the same. They use mob tactics.
They bribe, blackmail, threaten and, if necessary, kill. They also never forget a grudge. They also stick together.
That said, when they face another group that plays hardball, like the Chinese in China, Jews back down. They’re also terrible at actually running anything, since as a mob, they’re designed to skim the profits of people who can run a business or government. They have no skills are running anything.

                    My gut says MacGregor was also passed over due to age.
Looking at Trump’s picks as a whole, he’s mostly going for folks in their 40s and 50s.
I believe there are multiple reasons for this. The obvious ones are bringing in a much higher energy level, breaking with the current DC gerontocracy, and to ensure that the MAGA movement outlives Trump in some form.

                We cannot lose sight of the fact that–Trump’s victory  notwithstanding–this is still AINO and it remains the implacable enemy of our people. It would take far more than a good presidential election result to reverse 60 years of burgeoning anti-white racism.

                    4 years goes by fast. It was over 9 years ago that he came down the escalator. It’s not enough time for comprehensive change. The best hope is to set back the permanent regime to where it will take longer than that same period of time for it to recover its prior position.

                        True. I don’t think the Regime really regained its footing after 2016, though. As hideous and destructive as throwing open the border was–and The Great Replacement is the Regime’s end game–it also reeked of desperation. The open border hurt the Regime, too. I agree with your general take but the return to the prior position is at best difficult now. Nothing can be exactly the same as it was although best efforts will be made. That is better than what we had.

                        I think we are going to get that extra time. At least a good share of it. Boomers and X are going to be dying off, and we are getting some seriously pissed off (for good reason) late Millenial and Z saying, “Project 2025 gave you the sads? FU. Wait until you see Project 2029, biotch!”
DOGE might be the catalyst for a lot of change. Read Vivek’s X (whatever a tweet is called now) and consider all the USSC decisions, and how broadly they will affecteverything, if people with balls are willing to push it.

                Yeah I wince a bit when Republicans start doing the “men in uniform” thing. The past 10 years or so has done a lot to discredit our men (and women and troons) in uniform, a discreditation which is needed from time to time. Otherwise we’re going back to a place where it’s 2003 all over again, with Fox News and Meet The Press ejaculating over anything gunpowder-related.I’d rather be patrolled by a couple Latinas on SSRIs than white boy robocops with armed-up SUVs. I’d rather lose wars of choice with lesbian admirals than a hundred Dan Crenshaws who pretend it’s Zionist Starship Troopers.Believe me, if and when we are invaded, white boys will know what to do.

                        “Except” is doing a lot of work there. The Great Replacement is the Regime’s end game, and the open border is part of that. I would even suggest we have been invaded and conquered and TGR is the way to consolidate power.

                    I hope you’re right that the military has lost respect in the eyes of the masses. And I’ll grant that it is certainly possible. However, I’ve got a side-hustle covering college basketball and football for a subscription website, and said occupation requires me to attend games. Now the athletic department for the local uni constantly does military-appreciation games and parades homegrown soldiers before the crowd to show just how down it is with the masses. And I regret to report that whenever one of these soldiers is introduced at midcourt or the 50-yard-line, the crowd springs to its feet and applauds like an AINO senator when Bibi enters the room.In many ways there is little more contemptible than your average sports fan. I can only hope they are not representative of the common folk in general.

Would it be better to fight pointless wars for Europhiles like Wilson? How about all the interventions in SE Asia, Africa, and Central and South America? Weren’t those just as pointless, and also got white boys killed?

            The general officer corps will have to be replaced lock, stock, and barrel. These dinosaurs are still trying to plan for the next version of WW2. The idea of continuing to rely on aircraft carriers and gaining beachheads for ground assaults is right up there with cavalry charges. Constant space-based recconnaisance and pin-point accurate hypersonic and ballistic missiles, along with cheap drones have made surface ships and troop/equipment deployment areas almost impossible to protect. Projecting power against peer opponents half way around the world would be disastrous. The world has changed and warfare with it. The US military is almost a generation behind in key areas and is in no shape to be confronting Russia or China, let alone Iran. This fact is not going to go down well with the American public when they find out. Need proof? The Red Sea is still closed.

                The good news is Hegseth doesn’t have to be approved by the senate for Trump to be able to purge the brass. Trump can do that with the stroke of a pen any day he chooses. There is no legal means to prevent the president from firing generals, any generals, all generals (and admirals). Any or all officers down to the 2nd lieutenants and ensigns if I’m not mistaken. Enlisted too, I guess.

                Increasingly think Carriers exist mostly as real “red lines.”
If a carrier is sunk, there are only 2 responses:  withdraw or launch nukes.
China gets this.  They’re building carrier groups knowing there will never be another Battle of Midway of carriers vs carriers.
They’re floating islands of inviolate national sovereignty.  A giant “Do not f with us” that moves.  Billions of dollars, decades of building, thousands of personnel…RED LINE.
Can you sink it? Probably.  Can you handle the total, thermonuclear armed missile response against one of your cities?  Probably no.

                    In effect carrier groups are a present day Great White Fleet. You send them out upon the oceans of the world so as to impress upon Lesser Breeds Without the Law that they should pay due deference to your ambassadors, trade negotiators, and divers other officials.The Great White Fleet was loaded with battleships just obsoleted by HMS Dreadnought. Didn’t matter. People noticed a @#$%ton of capital ships and knew that the nation that could produce these could easily knock out a passel of Dreadnoughts. The GAE was being born. Note was taken. Attitudes adjusted.There might be an element of this with the Chinese carrier building program. The next Asian economic crisis probably will *not* be marked by anti-Chinese pogroms in Jakarta, unlike those of 1998.Something Trump and his new SecDef could do relatively cheaply and quickly would be to slap a fresh coat of paint on the entire US fleet. The thing about Lesser Breeds Without the Law is that they’re not all post-modern and into grungy authenticity. Shiny and New is Good. They notice things like Chinese and Japanese ships being spotless and USN assets having more rust patches year on year.

                There is much to what you say, but if you think the generals and admirals are thinking about carriers and beachheads, you are fooling yourselves.  They are thinking about DEI and affirmative action and not doing anything to make it look like they are helping Trump.
Most all need to be cashiered because they are self-serving spineless liberal sissies, not because they are dinosaurs.  They are vermin.  MG Kelly e.g.

                            Cursus Honorum — The mandatory by convention career path for Roman aristos aiming for the high offices of state. There were certain offices and postings you needed to have to be in the game. Missing one or two would make you an also-ran at best..The admirals who really matter since WWII have mostly been guys who came up through being naval aviators and flying attack aircraft off carriers. They drive the obsession with carriers and surface combatants to screen carriers because that’s where they came up and it’s where their patronage networks of underlings reside.Logic and strategic planning for the Next War don’t get much of a look-in. These guys are getting rich post retirement making targets for Chinese and Houthi (FFS) missiles. What do they care about ‘Winning’?Arguably the most important guys in USN are the submarine branch and the unmanned systems guys and the unglamorous types who mine and mine sweep. How many of them get to become Perfumed Princes?

                The US is the most defensible country on the planet. A few submarines, a carrier or two (maybe), some fighters and bombers and a very deep missile defense system along with a small army and robust reserve would be more than enough. We spend nearly $1 trillion on defense (offense, really). We’d be more than fine spending $100 billion.
Take the remaining $900 billion and use it on infrastructure, building technical training schools for young men and nuclear power plants – and border patrol. We’d be the envy of the world.

                        Canada is a real worry. Not least because the American public and its elected officials have conclusively demonstrated profound inability to hold two ideas in their heads at the same time. Easy to imagine intense focus on fixing the Mexican border and Boomer-grade blind spot about the Canadian border coexisting.

                    When you spend more on defense than the next five or ten countries combined, and still can’t win a war, something is seriously wrong. If you cut the budget to $100 billion, the dopes in the Pentagon would spend it on Pride parades and diversity training, then complain they have no money for bullets and gas.

                    Carriers are only for projection of power. Land-based aircraft out-ranges carrier-based aircraft, except when they do stupid things like Joint Strike, where they have to nerf the land-based advantages to end up with a one-size-fits-none answer.
You would be vastly better off with strips up and down the coasts, and ones specifically placed to counter possible opfor strips in Mexico and Canada.
But that would not give much ability to fight wars of opportunity…

                I truly don’t have any great expectations for Trump, and believe there is little anyone can do to ‘fix’ the economy (inflation, low wages, manufacturing, etc.).  And, like Zman and others, I’ve made note of the Israel lobby foreign policy choices.  But Trump’s domestic picks seem to enrage all the right people, so I’m enjoying this.  I thinkrfk jr is a kook except when it comes to vaccines, so I hope he slashes HHS.  I’m also not convinced Tulsi Gabbard is the second coming, but if she upsets applecarts, have at it.  I don’t know if even Trump realizes just how deep the rot goes in the DoD (and how many Obama purged and replaced in the ranks.  Now let’s get someone to start pulling clearances by the thousands.

            As I understand it (poorly), the SecDef has no direct authority over the military.  Basically a liaison between the Joint Chiefs and the Executive, as well as being the public face of the US military to our few remaining friends and many, many enemies.
Unless he’s ready to tell Trump to fire general officers on the level of Nimitz’s officer purge after Pearl Harbor, (there’s cause, 20 years of failed wars), he’s just window dressing.
I hope he does.

            Speaking as a former O3 who got out because most of the folks field grade and above are self-servin  dopes, I think Hegseth has probably got things figured:  Most folks who join to leave after one tour, and those that remain are fighting for pay and pension.
The number of general officers who are willing to trash Trump and embrace woke is shocking.  And its not like they are any good at winning wars…  I always say, when they pin on your oak leaves, they remove your heart and your brain.  Prove me wrong.

                    There are somewhat over 800 flag rank officers.  OK, so many are paper pushers, nonetheless replacing all is a Herculean task.  If now you select the next tier down—well, best rethink.  Short of a war time situation, how do you rise those replacements up through the ranks—even if you start at Colonel?

            The reason we have a “Nicholas Name” touting his GWOT bonafides in support of Hegseth is because Hegseth is an ultra Zionist who sees it as America’s divine duty to destroy the Middle East for Israel. Hegseth got Trump to pardon war criminals because stabbing a captured teen to death who was in the process of receiving medical treatment is just the American way. He is a staunch supporter of the assassination of Soleimani because assassination is as American as apple pie. Hegseth carries on another grand American tradition of being twice divorced because he had an affair on the mother of his children so he could marry a woman who already had children by another man.Saying Hegseth will gut the officer corps is sugar coating and distraction from the fact that someone like Hegseth would see it as his divine duty to drag America into a war with Iran, so Hegseth will only fire generals who will not play ball on that front. Anything more would detract from his divine mission. Hegseth could be that dumb, but I doubt it.This reeks of the worst sort of psyop.https://web.archive.org/web/20211104200420/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/us/navy-seals-crimes-of-war.html

His background shows he was a valedictorian, athlete, Princeton and Harvard Grad, yet he comes off as a dude bro degenerate with little to no intellectual bona fides.

                It’s all a psyop.All the MIGA picks are for Mideast war,the biometric ID “for the border” is going to extend to everyone,Elon’s “judicial, eventually prosecution” DOGE will monitor the internet,Palantir surveillance by jews Ellison, Thiel, Luttnick, with Musk will dominate,And the jews aren’t going away.War in the Mideast to disrupt Islam’s resurgence is far better a necessary use than a brother war on Russia.Look, we’re headed into a Technocracy, like it or not; best we can do right now is have one that wants to cultivate white people’s talents as valuable slaves and subjects, rather than wipe them out entirely.Plus, my religious faith tells me that whites were made by Gaia and the God of Nature to come back from extinction-level events, so I see even Israel’s role as pivot to our martial heritage.Retvrn, we’re gonna need some mad zealotry of belief.What do white people do in a disaster? The right thing.Trying to make my peace with what cards we have in a bad hand, here; once we retrench and everyone feels the heat, this ‘all one family’ horseshit will go away and we will kick some goddam ass, as we’ve done again and again.

It’s not four aces, no, but neither is it 7-high. This is all relative. We are holding the best hand at the table. I mean, seriously, who else would you place your bets on?
But that does not mean we should be kicking out normie or griller or sportsballer or anyone else. We just don’t let them win. They take point, so we know when they plan to call it a day, and turn their weapons on us.

            Using the military as a wedge to reinvigorate and reinsert masculine values into society works for me.
Added bonus is imagining all those real vets who’ve been in the thick of it thinking about what they’ll do to the tiktok queens, dog boys, and furries, especially those noxious troons in skirts in the Joint Chiefs and SecDef.

                Your hopes will come with a higher cost than you imagine.People like to hope that the Pentagon is not dumb enough to get into a war with Iran because the GAE military is incapable of winning it. First problem is “can” never gets in the way of “should” with our ruling class. Second problem is that they are forgetting Pearl Harbor and why it happened. Losing most of their military assets in the ME will be the Pearl Harbor that justifies a flash reorganization of the military and putting the US on a war economy to reshore our industrial base. Hegseth’s first job will be to ensure the top brass are dumb enough to get in a war with Iran. His second job will be to flash reorganize the brass into a group of psychopathic Zionists who will kill anyone for Greater Israel, and he is a person who will do that job.Now remember Vietnam, where the point was to get the troops to do terrible things to random villagers and then fly home to get spit on by anti-war protesters. You want a military who will kill anyone not born in their zip code, you put them through Vietnam. A war against Iran and friends will be another such war. Russia is one of those friends, so the bit about avoiding a brother war is naive. Russian troops will not be on the front lines, probably, but our troops will be very aware that some of the munitions killing their brothers were made in Russia.People hope that US citizens will not put up with such a war right now, but the Zionist slice of the population will be proud to send their sons and daughters to die in Iran. They have been doing it for thirty years. They are still doing it. Add in the rest of the Pearl Harbor scenario, and the ruling class will get away with it.Whatever is left of the GAE military after they crawl back out of the mountains of Iran will be a lot closer to a force of psychopathic Zionists who are willing to kill anyone not born in their zip code for Greater Israel. Are you willing to pay the cost of that in your home state?

        An important point to remember is that the Bad Orange Man can appoint all the Iran hawks he wants to appease the Bagels, but if (and that’s a big if) Hegseth is taking a wrecking ball to the military and purging the officer ranks, the war hawks will not have a tool to use as the military is in the throes of reconstituting itself. The situation is much like Mustache Guy and Big Red found themselves in in the mid-1930s, where they were busy breaking their armies to their will and thus unable to use them-yet. That’s not even considering the option for the Bad Orange Man to deploy the military to the border, which would cripple any momentum for foreign war. The war hawks can stamp their feet and bluster all they want, but they ain’t got the means, or the political climate with domestic concerns and an invasion to repulse at home being the heart of Trump’s mandate.

            Agreed. I think all the Iran war talk is overblown. Sure, the Mizrahim want it, but Trump’s no fool and he’s not about to founder his administration on a preposterous and doomed misadventure against the fanatical Shi’ites. Trump is many things, but self-destructive is not among them.

                Like I said over at Sev’s joint, expecting the Trump administration to dig up Heinrich, Reinhard, Sepp, and the boys to run his foreign policy just ain’t happening, because weaning “conservatives” off of interventionist foreign policy and military dick riding is like weaning a junkie off smack. America First is a cultural shift, not a policy, and that is not something Trump can force on them cold turkey.

Or he’s a peace-through-strength type. Was the bit about bombing Iran if they build nukes just a threat to keep them from doing so? Anyway, that was 2020. Now that Russia is in Iran’s court, I’d wonder if he’s still as much of a brinksman.

        Israel is committing suicide by picking fights with all its neighbors while hoping they can coerce the US military to save them. Iran has accurate hypersonic missiles which cannot be interdicted and a world class air defense system via Russia. And they are playing tit-for-tat. Israel attacks and they hit back harder. And Israel is losing on every front. If this keeps up, the Zionists will eventually turn to nukes. Trump’s newly appointed warhawks will pitch a hissy fit, but they are impotent and reality is a bitch. So yes, if WW3 happens, it will start in the Middle East.

            Yep. We are entering a very dangerous time – and it has nothing to do with Russia or China or, even, Iran. It’s Israel getting taken over by the ultra-Orthodox at the same time as US power is fading.The crazy Jews want a Greater Israel and submission from all of their neighbors and are openly fighting for it. They also believe that the US can help them make that happen. But we can’t. We don’t have that power anymore. This means that Israel’s neighbors will fight back – and win.At that point, the crazy Jews might just go nuclear. This is by far the biggest danger to the world.

                Agreed. I once thought the Pakis were the worst possible candidate to have nukes, but they are a distant third to Israel. The United States playing chicken with Russia of late gives it the silver although arguably American Jewry’s heavy hand in that madness makes it somewhat indistinguishable from Israel.

                Why does that make it dangerous for us? So long as the US keeps out of it, which includes not only refusing to allow Zelensky to attack civilians deep in Russia, but also stopping giving them and Israel a damn thing.

Their 92 missles are only midrange, anyways. Maybe those chickenshit Muzzies will leave Europe to go fight for their homelands, and drag the Africans with them (they did that in the Middle Ages.)
Nah, that’s wishing too much.  But the Euros can then make ’em do so at gunpoint.

            Being something of a fan of depopulation of the darkies, if we can get the party started in both Islam and India (via Pakistan), then I’m not exactly against it. If Africa starves as a consequence, then I’m all for it.
The Southern Tier is where the problem is.  We’d just be helping Nature do her natural thing.

        Immigration reform:Glad you led with this.  It’s the only thing I’ve cared about for 4 decades of voting.  Constant disappointments.Read somewhere that the current LEGAL “asylum seekers” are in the millions and have a backlog that would take 100+ years of adjudication even if there were no appeals.Biden put his foot on the gas by transporting 3/4 of a million AS by air (!!) Along with millions at the border.Democrats went for broke to bring in a permanent majority.The only way this reverses is if Trump ignores the niceties of the law and goes full Caesar.I’m not optimistic.  But I’ll enjoy watching him try.

            If Trump concentrates on immigration and the FBI, I would be satisfied.  For all the ranting I do about the Military, they are harmless.  They live in their own little world of dress-up and playing soldier.  If left alone they will be happy and not bother us.
Immigrants, however are going to trash the country.  And the FBI and DOJ are a danger to every American on a daily basis.

Yes, but. That’s because the enemy wrote the rules of engagement. They can be rewritten. Might be Hoven can do it, probably Noem, though.
Whomever signs the affidavits is legally on the hook for perjury in most cases. Most of the pro-asylum groups and lawyers are not going to be willing to go to prison over it. Personally, I see that as a win. Commies in gen-pop, fake asylees gone. Most states don’t let felons vote, right?

                The sentiment is good, but the numbers are not. I posted them a few days ago. We have 4000+ per judge of cases of asylum seekers to be adjudicated. Court dates now extending up to 5 years into future. That seems right given the 680 or so immigration judges currently available. My recommendation for Trump is to create as many judges as needed to adjudicate all asylum claims on an acceptable time scale, like 24 hours. We’d then not need to release IA’s upon interception, but adjudicate their claim and fly them back home without ever letting them settle in or be released. As far as those currently on parole, we simply publish their moved up hearing dates and immediately declare non-shows as persona non grata. Then when they are intercepted/detected through other means, they get deported immediately.

                    You don’t think that a whole crapton of those applications would be withdrawn if the people whose signatures were on the affidavits understood that with the new sheriff in town, perjurywillresult in prison time? Five years in prison per perjured application, served consecutively, would sure make me think long and hard about whether I could prove this person was a valid asylee.

Trump has the possibility of using recess appointments for some positions.
The precedent for such appointments exists. Clinton had around 190, GWB had 170, and the Lightbringer still needed 30 or so with a totally compliant DC establishment.

                One trick used in the past has been to pick a nominee of great controversy to insure an easier time for a “secondary” nominee to be recommended when the first was rejected or voluntarily withdrawn.

                    Well, that’s one aspect of deal making – issue a seemingly outrageous demand to start and see what happens.
If the other side accepts, great, you’ve exceeded your goal.
If not, you start climbing down from the extreme ask, still hopeful that the other side will agree to something that still exceeds your original ask.
Eventually, you will get to your real bottom line position, which the other side should find easy to agree to, thus meeting your original goal.

            Thune is in a tougher spot than McConnell. He can no longer pretend to represent the voters while at the same time obstructing Trump appointments. Not that McConnell really could either, but at least he had Trump losing the popular vote on his side. Of the “controversial” nominees, at this point to include RFKJ, Gabbard, Gaetz, and Hegseth, McConnell would have shot down all 4. With the change in environment that Thune faces, I predict 2 up and 2 down. Optimistically 3 up and 1 down. But at least 1 of those 4 is going down.

        The Senate is the last bastion of traditional GOP cuckservatism. All Republicans tend to be cucks to some degree although it is in the Senate where that manifests to an extreme degree. Matt Gaetz likely will be rejected there but he very well may get a recess appointment. That possibility may in fact have been the price for John Thune to get the Leader role without Trump actively campaigning in the 2026 primaries. It is a reasonable guess Gaetz’ primary goal will be massive demoralization via leaks and to a lesser degree noisy investigations and prosecutions. While it is now ludicrous to everyone outside of the District of Columbia, those within it see themselves as above reproach, yard sale Eloi, if you will. Airing out their dirty laundry could be helpful and shame them, and since there really is no political solution at this point, weakening this corrupt system by damaging its foot soldiers could zap its ability to lash out in the future. I see some of the other cabinet nominations in the same light, and it is a pleasant surprise.The United States is a totalitarian system at this point. Checking the police state apparatus and preventing its expansion is probably the best that can be hoped, and that will prove a major thing if it happens. Along these lines, one of the real green shoots from this election has been the emergence of a rogue elite. These are not our people in any way, but they share our fears and concerns and there is some overlap of interests. That is much better than any previous outcome. Another green shoot is a significant chunk of the public did not buy into the massive propaganda. Both of those aspects hold promise on keeping the police state apparatus in check.Outside of changing the conversation on immigration, which has happened, Trump’s few triumphs largely have been inadvertent. Luck has a quality of its own.

            “…Trump’s few triumphs largely have been inadvertent. Luck has a quality of its own.”
True, but note that Trump was specifically elected/comsidered as a “disruptor”, a wild card (at least such often discussed here). Nothing changes with electing the same old, same old to rule from Washington.  I therefore give credit to Trump for such changes, even if unpredictable/inadvertent.

        Somewhat related, the NYT is calling for a color revolution. Obama seems to be urging it on, with various media outlets saying that the Generals and Admirals are “preparing” to “act” upon Trump. Then there are the Governors like Pritzker, Polis and Newsom preparing to prevent any deportation especially of criminals of illegal aliens in their states and possibly in others.So while we have not had mass riots and such … stay tuned. There might be well spicy things coming. Obama will not go gentle into that good night of political and power irrelevance. So Trump V. Obama 2.0 is coming.

            I’m not sure who Pritzker et al could activate here.  The blacks are pissed that the illegals are cutting ahead of them in the handout line.  Even the legal latinos are annoyed.  I don’t see the antifa meth heads and cat ladies mounting an effective street fighting force.
Of course the Chicago Police Department would charge straight into a hedge of bayonets if Pritzker convinced them their pensions were on the line.

        I am glad to finally see a pundit/analyst, say out loud that there are at least two different Jewish networks messing with Western political systems:The Neocons and the Israel Lobby. Of course, these two are allied, agree on many things, will always play ball with each other and neither of them has our best interest at heart.. but they also have their differences of opinions in what regards priorities and means to achieve their goals.I might be pointing out something obvious, but the only thing I would add is that I see a third faction/network of Jews, the one that tightly controls the Far Left and the most secular of the three.The Neocons, as you pointed out yourself in the past, are a splinter group of this faction that grew to become a faction in and of themselves.Again, this faction will play ball with the other two, sees them “as family with whom we disagree on methods and priorities mostly” and has absolutely no love for us.I call them the Troskyites for lack of a better term.Prominent members of this third “clan” would be Soros, Schumer…

            Good post. However, I would argue that the group you call the Trotskyites are actually the Judeo-Puritans and their power source is academia. Naturally, the Jews are overrepresented in this bloc, but the group itself is not pro-Israel or neoconservative. Theirraison d’etreis to subjugate the white race, and as such, they are much more concerned with domestic issues–including open borders–than foreign policy.

        Pleased that your edit noted Bunny Mellon’s stepson Timothy as the biggest Trump donor.   Trump’s two other mega funders, Miriam Adelson and Elon Musk, represent Jewish wealth and Tech wealth.  Mellon is Permanent Wealth.  So Trump got the trifecta here, too.
Before Trump, Mellon was almost singlehandedly (and very generously) funding RFK Jr.  So I hope Trump is motivated to ram that nomination through.  Just getting all the dirt on Wuhan and Fauci out there would be a massive win.

        So it appears that the latest cope from the left is that Trump, while having won, didn’t win in a landslide. Sure, he won all the swing states, in other words, all the states that were contested. But “he has no mandate”, because Harris won something like 48% of the vote. In aggregate.I heard Sylvester Stallone proclaiming Trump “our second George Washington” at a gala at Mar-a-Lago. At first, I thought that sounded ridiculous. But given what the Donald has gone through over the last eight years, and given the fact that Washington himself never had support from the majority of the country, not even from his own mother, it makes sense, given the fake and gay conditions we live in.Our forefathers didn’t win a plebisite; they won a revolution.

        The Zman says the Israel lobby goes back to at least Truman, maybe FDR, but it arguably goes back much farther. During the Civil War Gen. Grant ordered Jewish war profiteers away from his camps and made some unfavorable comments about them. When he ran for President, he felt obligated to disavow those comments and avow that he was not anti-Semitic. Why would he feel obligated to do that if it wasn’t to appease powerful interests?Arguably going all the way back to George Washington’s letter to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Washington recognized that there was a need to appease Jewish interests.

        As much as we’d like to see Trump and his crew administer a massive dose of radiation, various forms of incrementalism is probably the most realistic, outside of a few key areas.  Here’s keeping the fingers crossed.  Exploding libtard heads is a pretty good pacifier though…
Really like the first Trump presidency vs now as the “pre-season” game analogy – hopefully spot on.
