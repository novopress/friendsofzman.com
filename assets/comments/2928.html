        Madonna? Interesting… I knew a girl once who became infatuated with a man who thought he was the next saviour of humankind and insisted he be called ‘Maitreya.’By all accounts he was persuasive in the way good salespeople are, and could do tricks like making people ignore pain when walking over hot coals. He also made endless pronouncements about the ‘nature of the evil of five’ to the point he banned anything that added up to five from his large house where fawning people gathered. Apparently his small band of followers were relieved he regarded the hand as four fingers and a thumb rather than the expected five digits. Probably the same with feet as if the big toe had another function to the other four.I met hims couple of times and noted he was always tugging his shirt sleeves down to hide some tattoos, though I couldn’t see what they were. He didn’t like me because I didn’t gush his praises as others did, so I was declared ‘a devil.’ Oh well, I’ve been called worse.Eventually the police were called to his house and this small group of devotees broke up, possibly because the man had been taking LSD and getting dangerous.The girl went on to other things, but sadly was always looking for the next saviour of humanity. She told me once, that the task had fallen to Michael Jackson because she liked his music.People are endlessly fascinating.

        Isn’t it ALWAYS when “words mean something”, evolves into something disingenuous?I know, I know, it’s retarded.But the more people disingenuously “afflicted” on paper, the more “special considerations” supplantSOMEBODY’S failure to hoe their own row.
