        Chomsky said that if you want to understand the World you should read the Wall Street Journal and not the New York Times because money do explain Peoples action.

        Well, the thing about the Fed and Wall St being a crooked game is, if you come into a crooked game, it’s already crooked, and nothing you can do will change it. This has all been rigged for decades, what’s happening now is the level of manipulation has reached a point where even the players understand that they’re being played.Or as they say on the trading floor, “the firm made money, I made money, two out of three ain’t bad.”

        I have long said that our politicians and leaders no longer understand the world they profess to rule: it is too complex, too variable, too much a mystery wrapped in an enigma. That means we will increasingly see the likes of Obama and Cameron who will say one grand thing but be ready all too quickly to jump to the demands of small groups, simply because they cannot possibly see the big picture. Our leaders will be led increasingly, and if we the voters should benefit that will be an unintended consequence, not an aim.True they will have experts and advisors by the thousand but there is too much going on to warrant a lot of time and effort trying to understand it. All the data in the world will not help sort it out, but when you are being advised on the numbers and listening to those who want something for themselves then that saves lot of time and effort. And so what if the people who elected you don’t vote for you again? So what if they think you turned out to be every bit as shallow as feared. The ‘leaders’ are safe, the ‘great and good’ have made it big when they were never big enough all along.

        I don’t trust anything any government puts out, any more. Come to think of it, I haven’t trusted anything any government puts out since 1969.
