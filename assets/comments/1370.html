        Take it from someone with real experience with electrical grids and electronic device design.  Regardless of how big a useless douche-nozzle Gingrich is, a real ‘Carrington Event’ in the US would make for something all those ‘Zombie Apocalypse’ movies look tame in comparison.
Not that it’s time to panic – far from it.  But, it is always time to be prepared.

        Now that you’ve got your ad hominem out of the way, how about talking about the point of the article? I do have a history degree or two, but also an advanced technical degree and a background in weapons. A flare/emp event might be a long-shot, but it’s hard to discount the damage that could be done. Wiki ‘Carrington event’ and ‘Starfish Prime’ to see.
