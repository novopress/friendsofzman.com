        Over the years I’ve done a lot of IT consulting for banks as well as writing software for them, and even, at their request, served on the operations committee of one. I always had the impression (which is subjective) that the bankers didn’t really like the IT people and sometimes operated to make their programmers much less efficient (1 example: One bank would only provide 1 terminal per 3-5 programmers in small cubicles not allowing enough room for the books &amp; papers &amp; printouts they needed. Even when I pointed out the inefficiency, the bank made no changes). I don’t know if the banker’s attitude towards IT guys was disrespect, fear, lack of understanding &amp; not wanting to understand or something else, but programmers frequently did not have the same access &amp; cordiality as even minimum wage newbies hired as bankers. For whatever reason, I did seem to have their respect, but, based upon observations I never desired to be a bank IT employee.It seems very strange to me as well because if you look at modern banking, banks are actually huge computer service companies that do a little banking on the side.On the topic at hand, were it me, I’d quit and say FU, but then most of my life I’ve been self-employed because of my desires for independence so I’m not as afraid as most, I guess, to assume I can take care of myself, and it may be harder and scarier for others.

            yeah, quite right.  Bankers liked to treat IT and tech staff like indentured servants.  Kept tying up access to systems and access, tighter every year.  Gee, just like they didn’t trust anyone.  What did the man say, “The most distrustful of other men are usually so because they are cognizant of the dishonesty in themselves”.
What’s ironic is that (at least at the Bank of America) they migrated all the upper level access to India.  Good luck with that.

        I wrote this before I saw LJ’s comment and agree with it.
Maybe I’m missing something here, but what’s to stop the employee from resigning and seeking another job elsewhere? There must be something else in that severance package that we don’t know about for this scenario to make sense.

        It’s this kind of crap that gets unionization started. A union thug would be smart enough to get termination conditions written in long before termination becomes a fact.

        If I have any pride in my own abilities AND if I am in financial position to risk it. I tell them to stuff the severance package, file for unemployment, and begin an aggressive search for a new  job in the same field.That course of action is one where your savings can service your debt  for  6 months or so

        Sign the agreement, cash the checks.   As long as you are still getting checks, answer the phone.  After the checks stop coming; a. don’t answer the phone or (better) get a new number. b. “Yes, cut the Red wire now…hello, did you hear that?”.

        Desire for revenge is front and center with revolutionaries.
Your smarter revolutionaries know this, and channel the vengeful impulses of their followers into street-level movements like the Brownshirts.  The verybestrevolutionaries find guys like Felix Dzerzhinsky — the Cheka’s famous chief torturer really thought he was doing all this for the common good, and that the glow he got from revenge was really the satisfaction of a job well done.  Dzerzhinsky really thought that, once the Revolution was over and he could put away the thumbscrews and cattle prods, he’d be an elementary school teacher.  He really, really did.

        What’s worse is that if they don’t agree to the two years of uncompensated consulting, they won’t get the however many weeks or months of pay out they would get if they sign the termination agreement.

            It certainly seems one sided. Still, I take the money, and assuming it’s paid out one time or over several months, come find me. What are they going to do, sue me?
I suspect this has more to do with very senior staff with highly specialized and probably proprietary knowledge. And who would most likely be paid for their time, because you would want accurate help.

        Interesting thoughts as always, Z, but I have to disagree that our ‘betters’ think they are at war with us. I think the opposite: that like the Bank bosses, these people at the top think they can impose whatever they want on us and we won’t mind. They already don’t think we are at war with islam, despite all the evidence, and so they won’t think they are at war with us.We are, as many say, just the sheeple who will — like the SunTrust IT workers and experts (who can do the job the bosses can’t) — be on call free of charge when needed.As a Brit I don’t think much of revolutions: that is the sort of thing that the French do along with eating snails, or that the Russians tried once but having realised that a nastier type of person got to be in charge they daren’t do that again in case it gets even worse. I always go with the saying that if you run with the riot over the price of bread some of the people running with you want to burn the bakery down.But as the political landscape is farmed by the elite to ensure that the people aren’t represented, revolution is going to appeal to more and more of the farmed and mown-down people. It may not end well but it will be an ending of a sort.

        My solution would be to give the same quality of advice to my replacement that I generally expect to receive on the helpline from India. That ought to cut short this experiment right away.
