        The sports writers on ESPN’s Around the Horn TV program have been pushing the same line about the supposedly growing interest in kickball in the US.  However, only one of them knew that many, if not most, of Europe’s professional soccer players end up suffering brain damage from concussions caused by heading the ball…which goes to show you how little these “experts” know about the sport.I did watch a bit of the title game, turned it off after getting bored watching nothing but long kicks see-sawing back and forth the entire length of the field, without either team ever getting any closer to the goal. I was fortunate to tune back in just minutes before Germany scored the winning goal after 113 minutes of a sleep-inducing 0 to 0 tie.  The “experts” on ATH claimed that such low scores in kickball games are a turn-off for American sports fans. Hey, guys, the scores in ice hockey games are also typically low, but do Americans and Canadians consider hockey games boring?  I don’t think so.  One big difference between ice hockey and kickball games is that the goalies in hockey turn back 20 to 30 shots on goal each game.  There’s a lot of action around the goal in hockey.  The problem with kickball is not just its low scores, but there is just too little action around the goal…not enough shots on the goal keeper. If “soccer” wants to increase its appeal to sports fans in the US, the rules of the game have to change to force the offense to keep attacking the goal, perhaps something like the back-court line in basketball which forces the offense to keep attacking to score baskets.  Forward and retreat, again and again, kick the ball up field, kick the ball down field, head the ball and knock yourself out, that’s just not going to fly.

            I tried to watch it, but I dozed off for a big part of it. I really don’t have a beef with the game of soccer. It is what it is. A little dull, but the World Cup is OK. Soccer fans, on the other hand, are more annoying than a rash.
