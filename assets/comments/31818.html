        I guess I had a different experience of “the suburbs” than is alluded to.I grew up in the 90’s and 00’s somewhere that many people would classify as a suburb (perhaps an exurb) of a major city in the Midatlantic, but the way my locality was set up, it was envisioned as a small town and it functioned as one. We had our town fire department, and we were proud of it. Once a year they’d show off all of the engines. The cops were honest and lived in the town and were committed to keeping it safe and secure while also being quite reasonable, especially with neighborhood parties that went on past 10 PM. We had our annual 4th of July parade and carnival. We were proud of our park. We hated our rivals from the other towns when we played sports. Our town had a colonial history, and we knew it, talked about it, and were proud of it. The neighborhoods were decidedly “suburban” with split level houses and ranchers on 1/4 acre of land plots, but it still felt like there was community. We had a lot of athletic fields across the town, but we also had an athletic complex. The houses near the athletic complex were quite small and the driveways always had Camaros and jetskis in them drifting ever closer to their repo date. We also had some houses with rusted hulks in the yard, but these were always in the back yard due to draconian ordinances. We also had a borderline commune in the woods where the weirdos could live. There were poor people. There were wealthy people. There were a lot more people who were somewhere in between.I settled down in a state in the Midwest and now truly live in a rural area. I’ve found that what I miss most about the “suburbs” isn’t the prestige or “the best people.” When I set aside the homesickness, what I really miss is the parochiality of my small town in the suburbs. Out here, everybody keeps to themselves. There’s no real town events. You have your acres and your neighbor has theirs. Granted, when I go home, I’m disappointed to find that a lot of the community of my home town is gone too, but there’s still some there and people still think wistfully about it and try to recapture it. It’s the atomization of the age and the tragedy of the commons. They tore down one of the two elementary schools and put up an old folks home. That’s never a good sign for a society. But it still feels a lot more like a society than being out in the woods in isolation. I also hate how far everything feels. I miss the ability to hop in my car, drive 2 minutes to the grocery store, pick up a gallon of milk, and head home. Now that’s an hour round trip for me. You have to go into the moderately sized city to get anything of note, and that’s something I’m not used to doing. My small town was self-sufficient and self-contained. There was a sense of security in that. Where there’s security, there’s a better chance to find community. I think Bennett’s Phylactery and others were led to believe (by old media and our media) that rural country is full of old souls who like to tend to their fields and retreat to their chair to read Longfellow before tucking in for the night. That’s not the case. In a lot of ways, they’re as atomized and victimized by the modern age as everybody else. There’s just a lower chance of your kid learning about the 407 genders in school, unless the eye of Soros drifted onto your small town in particular (Spencer, Indiana is a good case study on this).We get along with a couple other families from the local church, but we’re pretty far away. Kids need a lot of things, and one of those is peers. I’ve met well-adjusted homeschoolers who are polite, well-socialized, and lack the stereotypical awkwardness portrayed by an admittedly hostile Hollywood. I’ve met homeschoolers who look like they came straight out of central casting for a sitcom as the mouthbreathing weirdos who can’t use Pythagorean theorem but can (and frequently do) quote every single episode of Veggie Tales by heart and who think it is normal to refer to adults as their first names. The difference between the two? The former had friends and peers they played with. Family should be the basis for morality and habits, but eventually, people have to interact with others outside the family and be aware of what constitutes normal social interaction and what is a family “quirk.” On the other hand, you don’t want your kids pal-ing around with kids from the family that lets theirs watch R-rated movies and you’re stuck explaining to your 10 year old what fellatio is.I think there’s a miasma hanging over everywhere in the West. Some people are better equipped for different environments, but it takes a personal decision to not let it get to you to find happiness anywhere.

            In fairness, it’s much harder to make friends as an adult.  Particularly when dropped into a new location w/o someone to introduce you around (the other locals usually have an established circle of friends already)
Oddly, I suspect electronic connectivity doesn’t help either, as that reduces the incentive seek out locals.  It’s easy to end up in a situation where you’ve lived somewhere 5 years and still don’t know anyone.

            This was great and am honored to be the first to up-voot, but did not get the part about “who think it is normal to refer to adults as their first names.”
Agree that there’s a miasma and it’s everywhere in this country. It’s a great topic, the challenges and problems of relocating to a place where one is not local, or has no fambly or roots, on the hope that it will be less pozzed cuz rural. Chickens and goats will save us tho, in any case. Be ahead of the curve and get ur goat now.

                Rereading your comment I see you meant kids referring to adults by their first names, as weird. Which makes sense.

            Granted:  Convenience and instant availability of product is highly characteristic of suburbs, even those that feel like ‘small towns.’  I, too, used to be able to go two blocks away to buy milk – now it’s 25 minutes.  But either way that milk and that convenience was totally dependent on outside farmers and trucks to bring everything to you.  Now, at least, in any sort of crisis, I know people within a few miles who actually have cows.And many suburbs and small towns used to have local parades and a home-town spirit.  The atomization you lament is not based on miles, but on people.  When your ‘community’ – suburban or rural – is composed of the world’s flotsam and jetsam, there is no community at all.  Our rural small town does have local parades where everyone cheers their children.  It didn’t matter that many had to drive in from local farms and homesteads.As always, the people make the place.  What you miss is a sense of rootedness and homogeneity.  And those cannot be found anywhere except genuine small and rural locations in AINO today, where the remnants of heritage America still live.

        OT
I recently starting checking in to Scott Adam’s’ podcast.
It appears the ass whipping he’s been through recently has placed him in the “No Fuchs given” column.
If anyone has a theory as to why, I’d be curious to hear it.
He’s poking several alphabet agencies, and I wonder if his ire is genuine.
Listen to todays (Sundays podcast). He’s almost asking to be Swatted, and dropped in a joke in Leavenworth.

            Scott Adams is definitely genuine is my opinion. As to why he doesn’t give a feck, anymore, it’s likely cuz vax regret and the feeling of impending doom that can cause on someone like himself, who is man enuf to acknowledge that he made a huge mistake and might not be long for this world.

            Scott Adams was always guilty of scientism, as are many others in the Dissident Right orbit. Back when he was flying high, he was very much of the opinion that only STEM-y stuff mattered and that anything that couldn’t be quantified was balderdash. This results in a very narrow and truncated mind, an autistic view of reality.When someone like that goes through an existential crisis and suddenly has to consider things like philosophy and theology for the first time, it stands to reason they’re going to be rather inept at it. It’s a typical fate among quants. There is a certain type of person who thinks that because he understands science, he understands everything. He does not realize that philosophy is thelargerdiscipline. Philosophy embraces science within its orbit and goes beyond it.Philosophy and theology are not “soft” subjects. They are not less exacting than physics; they are very muchmoreexacting and more difficult to do correctly, because the subject matter is so much more ineffable. Scott could probably benefit from having a philosopher friend to talk to.

        Somewhat OT, it’s on. Nancy Pelosi just signed a letter demanding Biden end all aid to Israel over Gaza. Hilarity ensued.Point being is that the cities are very, very bad places to be now, and the suburbs are an easy target. Already MA and MI are “asking” people to house “immigrants.” Soon they will demand, and then just take. That’s easy in the atomized suburbs, where there are a lot of houses to take and not much social organization. All those houses are all together. The state can concentrate its forces and people cannot fight back. In the country, its different. The State will have to send everyone miles and miles to take houses, and will face local resistance.Now with WWIII pretty much guaranteed, with Blinken guaranteeing that Ukraine will join NATO and France and Germany announcing they are sending troops and instituting a draft (story this Weekend in the FT), assuming you are not nuked, and nukes do not fly, it is far, far better to be in the country. In the country, you can grow food.In WWII, there was strict rationing. No sugar, coffee, meat, fat, etc. People in the country with gardens, their own chickens, hogs, sheep etc. were OK. Being in the suburbs is a trap — the system that sustained it can no longer function. Trucks are going to be the first thing to go — even without WWIII, Biden has announced “green” mandates for electric trucks which means the end of the suburbs.People have been prepping for years, because they could subconciously understand what was going on, and see the vulnerability of worst: cities, and pretty bad: suburbs. You can grow your own food in the suburbs but at least one neighbor or drone system will rat you out and the authorities will come raid you for “hoarding” or what not. Much harder to do at scale in the country because of the tyranny of distance.Bottom line — you want to be where the State is not. Because they hate you and want you dead.

            Your fears make you persuasive, but it is groundless fear that powers you. We live in a technological system of electrons and civil laws. The breakdown you fear — and perhaps anticipate, just a little? — is an overblown reaction to scattered news events.
Are things trending good? No. Are they trending disastrous? Hardly yet. Wait and see before you rush off to your cabin in the mountains.

                It would take 5+ years for your average joe to even have a chance of becoming partially self-sufficient in food, what with learning knowledge skillsets, obtaining and becoming proficient with tools and equipment, preparing a farming environment and system which could be self-sustaining etc.Don’t wait until the air raid sirens are sounding to get out and start thinking about country living.

                    Do you think Vladimir Putin, a rich man, is going to risk everything over the Donbass region. I’m sure he trusts the West to fear his nukes enough to not fuck up his plans.

        It’s a great thought that all our great conveniences and “suburban” lives entail accepting certain grubbiness and degeneracy.  And fighting back against them might mean being tossed out into the void and losing that comfortable lifestyle.  It seems like the westward movement pioneers had everything to gain and nothing to lose, while in our day and age, there is seemingly a lot to lose (selfishly) for perhaps ephemeral gains?  Don’t get me wrong, drawing and quartering making a comeback would be fantastic…

        I’ve mentioned this here before, but the podcast reminds me. Having read Marx in college and more recently having read/listened to Catholic critiques of modernity, I was looking at things in terms of materialism, and it wasn’t adding up. Then, a while ago, I went to the gas station, and the guy working the register was a tranny. It occurred to me it was easier for this guy to change his body than to change his mind, and that told me that while there are problems of materialism, the dominant issue today is idealism. Looking at it that way, things started to click.Seems like Z is hinting at this, saying that the point of burbs is to insulate suburbanites from the sausage-making of life. Iow, they’re rejecting the world because it doesn’t look like their ideal. Material excess and its tradeoffs are in service to chasing this ideal, which might explain why people can live with them.This all brings to mind Quigley’s description of the Puritan view rejecting the body and the material world as being ‘sinful and dangerous and, as such, something which must be sternly controlled by the individual’s will’. Further, the bit about 17th century methods being divorced from other-worldly goals and applied to this-worldly, materialistic 19th century goals.Perhaps these methods were, in some sense, reapplied to other-worldly goals in the 20th century. Maybe unconsciously and confusedly, because if Quigley is correct, the middle classes are a product of the 17th century and essentially Puritan, whatever they might profess. Notwithstanding the hangover of 19th century materialism and the contradictions that combination causes.

            “God is dead” = 19th century materialism, new age/woke is a yearning for ‘dead’ God.
In secular terms, God is the superego— the scold. The self-denying, masochistic aspect of the Puritan ethic is the internalization of the same. One becomes one’s God in a sense, rather than relying on a present, in-this-world God, or the Church.
This is not un-Biblical, btw. Maybe an extreme interpretation of Scripture. Remember the sermon on the mount. One commits adultery merely by lusting, for example.

        I didn’t clearly understand the post that was being discussed, but my immediate thoughts were 1) it doesn’t sound like he was in a community at all, at least not of like-minded people. Wouldn’t such plans entail at least moving out with a small group?2) To the argument of, well you’re going to have poor, drug-users, and fat kids watching netflix… ok sure. But why should those people have the same rights as the person whose kids are studying hard and whose dad has some functional contribution to the community, like being the blacksmith? If anything they should have less rights if they’re a drain or a criminal underclass. So maybe the objection is having to interact with them as equals?

            What is jarring is how profoundly wrong his perceptions about Texas in general and Austin in particular are. Texas is vast and there are scattered pockets with the mindsets he fantasizes Austin has, but you won’t be finding any tech mega corps in them for the most part, and they all are menaced in a political sense by huge, sprawling and dysfunctional urban hellholes inside the state. And even if Texas itself somehow avoids descent into darkness over the next decade, it has no leadership or even political will to fight against the frustrated hordes outside its borders. That could change but it doesn’t look good.The writer is a tourist and always will be one, ultimately disappointed by the people into whom he imputed qualities that were never there, destined to move to the next fantasy land. He reminds me of the execrable writer Ron Dreher in that sense.

                        BasedTeuton: Dreher always in search of the perfect, the ideal, to suit the vision in his head.  Kind of like the suburbanites who imagine some bucolic version of the ‘country life’ without the animal shite and flies.  He was raised as a Methodist; converted to Catholicism, and then to Orthodoxy.  He divorced his wife and mother of his 3 children and moved to Hungary.  Always in search of that heaven on earth that he has a vision of, trying to find the reality that matches his vision.And he calls himself a conservative, but is a color-blind purist.  In short, he’s a fool – and not someone any legitimate follower of the dissident right should lend any credence to.

                I understand The Hobbit reference. Whites in America have dropped several inches in height over the last couple decades. I used to be above average in height and now I am a towering Titan. It was something my friends and I have talked about, how we tower over the generations after us and over rural whites and working-class whites.A theory on this phenomena: What the red pill and the manosphere and the PUAs didn’t realize about R select/ K select theory is that R select reproduction does not choose for height and intellect or even testosterone. This has been covered in such books as Bio History.  Hookup culture, and a world in which women have sway, does not choose for tall, intelligent, lantern jawed masculinity like k select does.  It chooses the fast life option, which is shorter, less intelligent folk. The lowest common denominator of whites are… Well, hobbits.  Doesn’t mean they are worse than negros or immigrants. Just they aren’t the whites of a century ago.

                That dude never was on “our side,” or anyone else’s. I think the Alt-Right did accomplish some of the laudable things he mentioned such as normalizing the pushback against anti-whiteness, even while those in that movement also had very unrealistic goals (an ethnostate outside of Israel is pure fantasy at present, for example). The Alt-Right also attracted large numbers of attention whores and grifters, sort of a mirror image of Antifa in that regard. It is telling that the piece mentions Richard Spencer because the writer is cut from the same cloth.I suspect there may be a concerted effort to push those who were in the Alt-Right toward more neo-connish policy goals such as open borders and forever wars, with an eye on using them as cannon fodder for the latter. That will fail miserably if it is the case, because the Spencer-type outliers were a discrete minority. I see a natural gravitation toward the more “conventional,” if that is even close to the correct adjective, dissident right.People eventually reveal themselves for the most part. Ol’ Walt just did.

                    Leftist youth movements are the children of the ruling class demanding their inheritance of power and status before their parents die. The alt right was our first nearly analogous thing, a demand from the barely-losers of “meritocracy”—smart white guys from good families who followed the righteous path of the dutiful student and for that didnt get their regime sinecures—demanding their rightful place in its hierarchy.When Trump didn’t give that to them, they aimed their rage at white losers, insulting the already injured, rather than at anyone who decides anything or has any power over anybody. Our conservatism, our leftism/Jewishness, and especially our Christianity all share a core American morality: The *local* downtrodden must be trodden further down.Z was unduly kind to the guy the podcast is about.

                He is not wrong unfortunately.  The number one interracial pairing is white men with “Hispanic women.”. Second most common pairing is white women with “Hispanic men.”That said, what guys like this fail to to take into account is the studies that show this fail to take into account two things.  Studies on “Hispanics” never take into account how “white” the Hispanics are.  They could very well be South Americans with pure Spanish, Portuguese, German or Italian blood.Second, they fail to take into account economic class.  A lot of interracial pairing occurs at the lowest level.  Working class and below.  And unless it involves a white man, it almost always goes badly.  Ending in divorce and single motherhood.

                    “ Studies on “Hispanics” never take into account how “white” the Hispanics are. ”Indeed.  One need only take note of US Census stat’s over the decades.  Once there was only one racial choice, Hispanic.  It was shown that many people from what we term Hispanic countries, mostly South and Central America, were choosing the Census “White” racial check box.Government couldn’t have this, so they invented another category, “Hispanic-White”.  Seems even the Hispanics—whoever the hell they are as a racial grouping—don’t even consider themselves Hispanics.So yeah, I can believe the interracial marriage stat’s wrt Hispanic—White couples.  Living in a majority Hispanic community, this is seen a lot and for many pairings the couple does not look very different from typical Whites.  You need to look very closely, especially wrt Latinas.Disclaimer:  It’s been at least a couple decade since I’ve filled out a census form.  I don’t follow the latest changes.

            This Walt Bismarck character is a case of a liberal contrarian that edgelorded himself to the other side while still having a liberal mindset.  When he bitches about the midwest being full of boring gosspy church ladies he’s making it clear that what he really wants is to be living in a shitlib city watching BBC and taking BBC.  And I suspect this is the case for most of the young guys who went to the alt right just to dress up like Hitler, they were just trying to individuate from their shitlib parents like angry teenagers only to fall right back into becoming their shitlib parents as adults.  Much like the hippies turning back into yuppies.

        Twenty-three verses here. Papist footnotes report that “This is the first of three poems on the forbidden woman, the ‘stranger’ outside the social boundaries”.

The pumping muscle appears again in verse twelve. A writer named T.S. Flanders, a guy who has been bouncing around from sect to sect, asserts that “The heart and soul of Christendom is the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus.” Does this not roll off the tongue better than would ‘Eucharistic Central Nervous System of Jesus’?

        If you have children, you probably don’t want them only around a bunch of kids who say you-uns.  Such people are not necessarily salt of the earth, God fearing kind-hearted Christians just waiting to accept your family into their community.Mostly, they are fat, tatted, drug addled and not heading anywhere in life, except to get high.  If you do find church going folks, woe to you if you disagree with them over not just religious matters but how the ladies should play patty cake at vacation Bible school.  They are a closed club, and if you an’t from there and if you family doesn’t go back 7 generations forget about fitting in.Also, you do have set your kids apart.  After all, they ideally will be better than their parents.  Unfortunately, country often people look down on “book learning” (you read all them books?) and believe attempting to improve oneself in life or even simply have curiosity about the world makes on a snot with an attitude of “he thinks his shit don’t stink.”As a side note, I was raised among such people, worked with them worked, have members of my family are a redneck as they come, and, though some are indeed wonderful people, I am happy in general to be the hell away from them.Suburbs at their best are a fortress from the harder parts of society, and that is good thing.  Since into literature, someone once wrote about good fences making good neighbors.  Well, the suburb is supposed to provide that fence.  On the other had, as Z says, such protection comes with a big price.  Also, they have declined in so many ways (far from perfect going back to the 60s and 70s btw).Moving to Austin is not moving to the suburbs.  It is moving to an overpriced,  over crowded, crime ridden city, with terrible traffic and road construction, full of pinkos (why has that word gone out of style?) and druggies and winos.  If you have enough money to insulate yourself from all that in Austin, good on you.Otherwise, a more modest suburb is probably a better bet for folks with family.For old, as has been pointed out here, better be close to a good hospital and those are increasingly scarce in the sticks.  But, hey, we all gotta go sometime, so there’s that.

            The suburbs, which, to be specific, are within ten to 15 miles of city cores, are where transgenderism and so forth actually take root. Yes, the madness starts in urban neighborhoods, but the real farm teams are the ‘burbs, where most of those denizens hailed, and most of their horrific ideas return and take root. To be honest, I’m quite glad to see the rural areas are getting trashed routinely now because that makes them less likely to be magnets, but reality could change all that in a flash.

                They are the nicest refugee camps ever built. Everybody admits this in so many words, whether it’s the suburbanite talking about seeking refuge, or the prog talking about white flight. If someone sees no other recourse, fine, but I often detect pride in being a refugee in the talk. “I left, and if it comes to it, I’ll leave again.”— that sort of thing.I don’t understand that. It seems disingenuous to me to talk about things like civilization when you aren’t willing to take a stand for them.Z is right that it comes down to risk-aversion. Nothing good was built without risk. Life is risky, and if you don’t put it on the line from time to time, you’re drifting along like flotsam. That’s what having skin in the game really means.

        I saw paradise. The greatest place that ever was. Christchurch New Zealand, before the Earthquake. Even back then they would not take me (too White, pale, stale, and male I guess). Now its overrun by the Third World. Thomas Wolf was right. You can’t go home again.And here’s the thing. That nice safe suburb? Its gone man. Gone and not coming back, ever. That hipster city Austin? Its gone, its a violent hell-hole now with White guys being arrested and charged with murder for defending themselves against murderous street robberies by vibrants armed with guns. The amount of homeless in Austin is about that of Seattle, with predictable results. I have seen article after article portraying the crime and violence of Austin on a par with Downtown LA’s skid row.And the same for every other hipster hangout and city. They are getting hammered, with Open Border “migrants” from the Third World prisons poured out into Western streets. No matter if its Oslo or Salem Oregon or Martha’s Vineyard, even Malibu is going to have homeless, “migrants” and the sort of home invasions and squatting and take overs that characterize the invasion of the West by the Global South. LeBron is upset that his neighbors got squatted by a bunch of “migrants” who cause such security problems he needs 24/7 Armed security. He’s complained to Mayor Bass who is acquainted with him and there has been no results. He lives in the Hollywood Hills. “Average” home prices there are likely in the tens of millions.My own suburb, I have seen homeless sleeping rough not two blocks from my house. I have driven past homeless dudes overdosing in front of the local church within five minutes walking distance. Break ins and cars being stolen or having their catalytic converters ripped out is a common thing here, with one neighboring home selling for just under $1 million. So there is that. Physcally its a nice neighborhood. But the threat is always there, lurking. [Over in Irvine, home invasions are a weekly occurence. At least its not daily. They mostly target Asians who tend to keep cash on hand.]There is no more “safe suburb” — its not safe, no place is safe or immune from the sheer tidal wave of the Third World crashing down and making White people a discriminated, hated minority overnight.

        As a Portlandite I’ve had this same issue. On the one hand I hate the politics of all the goodwhite twits around me, and extreme ends of liberal pretension are ridiculous.  But I also get repulsed by the rural lower classes: the opiod/meth druggies, the obesity, the mudsharking, the strange pig-man face thing some of them have going, walmart…
What I want is a group of sophisticated people who also enjoy classical music and aren’t shitlibs.  Tarring the right with being declasse was probably the most effective thing the lefties ever did.

I have very similar feelings about not fitting into and being somewhat annoyed by both groups you mention. I’d add mushy middle normies to the list.
I think these feelings are why I’ve taken to watching the Lotus Eaters on YouTube. They are the sort of friends I’d like to find in the US, but they don’t seem to actually exist.

                Ostei:  But rightwing intellectuals don’t have to be social snobs.  Life isn’t all sitting around discussing ideas and theories and the arts – as I did in college.  The real world includes working class people who can still intelligently discuss social or economic or religious issues, even if they’re not self-proclaimed ‘intelligentsia.’  I saw enough of the ‘intelligentsia’ in eastern Europe.  They all proclaimed they were devoted to the best interests of ‘the people,’ but they truly only represented themselves.  Lech Walesa was a working man, and Vaclav Havel was an anomaly.

                    Two of the most profoundly intellectual right-wingers I’ve known were farmers in the rural South. Even where they lived, far away from the psychotic leftwing zeitgeist, they kept their actual thoughts largely to themselves to avoid outright confrontation. If that meta culture had threatened their redoubts, they might have voiced their opinions openly, dunno. One of the two actually made moonshine, in part as a light affectation, in part because he was good at it. The guy also was the best musician I ever heard live.The Havel/Walesa distinction is spot on. I would like to think if the former had lived long enough he would have denounced Clown World but I doubt it. And as an aside, Walesa was one of the first people canceled after Me Too precursor allegations. That shows who was feared.

            Ploppy:  What you want doesn’t exist – hasn’t in most of human history.  You want upper-class pleasures and virtues in a middle-class society. You want the perquisites without the work that’s required to get there.
We don’t particularly want to deal with tweakers or the bottom 5% – but we take the good with the bad.  There are plenty of rural, working class people who are normal, and decent, and not at all stupid.  No, we don’t discuss the virtues of Shakespeare’s plays with them, but that’s not why we moved here.

                The middle-class man in AINO is more than capable of enjoying upper-class pleasures. I do, and I know many others who do.Classical music costs almost nothing to listen to, and even concerts by major orchestras are not exhorbitant. Middle-class people can dine at the finest restaurants, if not necessarily frequently, and they can prepare their own refined fare at minimal expense. We can read Shakespeare and Dostoevsky, Dante and Mandelshtam, Plato and Nietzsche at no charge. We can visit art museums, even if we cannot purchase their contents. And so forth and so on. That one must be rich to lead an intellectually and culturally rich life is a  grievous misnomer. And doing so, incidentally, doesn’t make one a snob.

                    Ostei:  I don’t believe I said (and certainly didn’t mean to imply) that no one who is middle class can have or appreciate upper-class tastes.  But rather that too many want those pleasures of the mind and the arts (which used to be the sole preserve of the wealthy aristocracy) without the working men who firs ensure things like food and shelter (Maslow’s hierarchy of needs).  Or, as Zman put it, they want to savor the sausage without dealing with the reality of how it’s made (the blood and guts of life).I’m not knocking the desire for or value of the intellectual life – I was raised valuing such, and educated in the same manner.  I was raised in suburbia and everyone I knew worked for the government or a think tank or an NGO.  It was only later that I met and learned to value men who could build engines or fix electronics or perform manual labor.Society needs an excess of what are now considered “lower-level” physical and trade workers in order to produce an excess of ‘needs’ so as to afford the luxury of ‘wants’ – such as a life of the mind.  And it takes a certain degree of skill and honesty and personal honor – generally found in highest number amongst White men – to perform those jobs that keep the lights on and the toilets flushing.

                        3g,
You’re positing an antinomy that I don’t think exists to any large degree. Hence, the rightwing intellectual–in contrast to his Leftist counterpart–values the working man and what he does greatly. Hell, Eric Hoffer, a respectable rightwing philosopher, was a longshoreman, for crying out loud. And, although I’m certainly no Hoffer, I have on multiple occasions said that I value plumbers above profs and have had more interesting conversations with tradesmen than with graduate students. I would even go so far as to say that genuine respect for the working man is the sine qua non of the rightwing intellectual.

                Well at the bottom you get the folks interbreeding with pigs and that’s an IQ problem that will always exist.  But the rural kulaks are just as intelligent as middle class liberal snobs in the cities, the thing is they willfully reject anything that they associate with those liberal snobs.  Which unfortunately means that instead of reading Shakespeare they’re putting plastic testicles on their $80k pickup truck’s trailer hitch.

You deal with the bottom 10% and top 10% as best you can, so long as you have sufficient carrying capacity in the middle.

                    Heh heh. You’re certainly correct to point out the reverse snobbery of the rural kulaks, and I would add the working class as well. I know because I caught some of that from my own father who was a very bright guy, but unlettered and decidedly working class in upbringing and outlook. I believe he felt more contempt than pride when I earned my doctorate.Now you might say his was the correct attitude in that regard, but regardless, it was a classic example of reverse snobbery.The country music scene has always been rife with it, too. Probably a defense mechanism against the contempt urban elites in this country have long dished out to the yokels.

            “On the one hand I hate the politics of all the goodwhite twits around me, and extreme ends of liberal pretension are ridiculous. But I also get repulsed by the rural lower classes”
Yep… as much as I would like to be a white supremacist, the white people don’t always make it very easy, do they?
Seems that we’ve achieved racial equality in this country by lowering the white trash down to the level of the negroes, rather than raising the negroes up to the level of the whites.

            I think rural whitefolk are great.  This meth situation is grossly over exaggerated.  I’ve personally never encountered a meth addict save for when I lived in California.  In the Midwest, my experience was that poor blacks downtown did crack and worst case scenario poor whites nearby drank hard on the weekends but still had to keep it together Monday through Friday.  Suburbs were safe and the punk teens smoked some weed.

                Rural white folk who are landowners with prosperous farms, local tradesmen and business owners are usually GTG.But there IS a rural white-trash lumpenproletariat out there — and they are not all meth addicts. Obese, tattooed, white women with blue or red hair and a nose ring, waddling through the Walmart in pajama pants and a pair of Crocs, maybe riding a mobility scooter… or jonesing for cigarettes and scratch-off lottery tickets on their way back to the trailer park or the disability office. Haggard, unkempt, gray-haired Boomers with “diabeetus” who haven’t had a haircut or a shave in a decade, dressed as if they’re homeless, in rusty 1999 Dodge Caravans full of dogshit and McDonald’s trash.We’ve all seen ’em.On the other hand, the fit, educated, liberal white foodies who appreciate craft beer are equally repellent insofar as they are obsessed with anal, transgenderism, abortion, feminism, climate change, EVs, and gun control.I feel like a man without a country. What ever happened to the nation that produced George Patton, Buzz Aldrin and Chuck Yeager? Today whites are either obese slobs, or bearded liberal simps with thick black glasses, tats, and Master’s degrees in sociology…

        On Bennett’s Phylactery:1. I’ve enormous respect for any young man who values the well being of his children. Starting with having them in the first place. I’ve followed him for a bit on Twitter.2.  The template of “the perfect suburb” is really just college for adult life. Great buildings, its own police force enforcing strict entry rules, massively hidden and subsidized infrastructure, and an all powerful bureaucracy that will nudge those who don’t fit with warnings, then excommunication.Suburbanites (and I am, regrettably, one of them) just want the college experience, only with our personal values expressed everywhere in our sight line. It can’t happen, because the college experience is itself a massively overpriced lie.3. B.P. is (I think) ex Mormon?  Reading him I had the sense that he bailed out for whatever reason but still wanted the values and the community provided by the LDS.But you can’t have one without the other.Sad to see the LDS slowly go down. The cultural sludge and degeneracy that comes over a fiber optic pipeline is everywhere now. Running for the hills won’t shield you from it.

        Growing up in the Deep South, I don’t remember that the Transcendentalists had much of an impact on me. I can’t remember any of Emerson’s poems or essays forced on us in High School. I’ve never read ‘On Walden Pond.’ From excerpts I can say it seems pretty hokey to me. Was Walt Whitman really a poet? I don’t think so. Learning more about Transcendentalism in college, I can’t say I’m impressed. If it’s fundamental to their thinking that human beings are inherently good, they’re flat out wrong. I’m much more impressed about the picture of human beings as described by Flannery O’Connor than by Emerson. And I’m not even Catholic. These utopian dreamers need to get out and smell the people. But they can’t face the reality of it.There was a time when the great mass of people were at least aspirational if only in superficial ways. They aspired to become better than their upbringing, at least the best of them did.  I guess they were common-sense ‘transcendentalists’, if you will, but with a healthy dose of realism and scepticism when dealing with others. Often now the children of the middle-class aspire to the lowest common denominator. We’re moving closer to ‘Idiocracy’ every day, where anyone who aspires to a higher standard is a “fag.” The problem is they think they can be ‘good people’ without any effort at emulating the really superior people which historic America has provided countless examples of. It’s no wonder because of the illiteracy of their own teachers who have been indoctrinated on the ignorant educational theories prevalent in the teachers’ colleges.But there are bigger wheels grinding inexorably in the larger world. Yankee America has never had to face real defeat. As a consequence, they keep doubling down, by for example, insisting that Ukraine will join NATO. Their entire world is about to be upended.

        In certain respects, Eric Hoffer could not be further from either a family man or a community builder. He lived as a transient laborer, by choice; he once wrote (I think it was in ‘The Temper of Our Time’) that he decided at an early age to remain poor and to work with his hands. By the time he became known, after the success of ‘The True Believer’, he was living in a small San Francisco apartment, working part-time as a longshoreman. Somewhere in his diary/memoir ‘Working and Thinking on the Waterfront’, Hoffer tells us what ingredients were necessary for his contentment; something along the lines of having his rent paid, a good book (and cigarettes) ready to hand, a notebook and a pen. I first encountered Hoffer’s writing in 1976, when his essay collection ‘In Our Time’ turned up at our house (I was sixteen). That same year I was reading Thoreau – Walden of course and his essay on Civil Disobedience – in high school. One obvious similarity between these two was that they were sure they didn’t have long to live, because of family history. (Thoreau died at 45; Hoffer surprised himself, dying at 80 or so). I figured that I did not have much time either, as I was certain – absolutely certain – that we’d all be obliterated in a nuclear war with the USSR. Ergo, what was the point of patiently building up a life, or a career, with family and deep interests? Why not bounce around and be, in effect, nothing? And what better place than the America of the time to do this? Hoffer himself wrote that America has elbow room for the common man; Thoreau built a hut in the woods (good luck doing that in Europe), “living life deliberately” as he put it. And in the back of your young mind you had Huck Finn telling you to “light out for the Indian Territory” when the going gets rough at home. All this built-in alienation is part of the American experience, because there is always a choice: You can be this or that, or nothing at all / You can live here or there, or nowhere at all.Of course in the present, the “suburban peasant” might live in the outskirts of any city at all, from Savannah to Detroit to Phoenix to Seattle, pick your cities, and the developments he’ll live in all are named “Valley Hill Estates” or “Forest Glen Hollow”, and within five miles there will be a Cracker Barrel, a Walmart, a Planet Fitness… and he’ll be more at home in any one of these transfer stations than he might have been moving twenty miles out of his previous suburb and living among the actual dirt people.

            I occasionally listen to the EXIT podcast and I’m a regular listener of yours. The guy who runs that podcast recently did an episode on the whole trad lifestyle delusion and I think you would be surprised just how much you guys agree.  I think you may be putting some words in his mouth. He basically says that whoever leans into the future wins and that groups like the hassids, Amish etc exist precisely because they are harmless and  pose no threats. I think his main point was that any level of societal change will not be achieved by hiding out in the holler with your trad wife. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s also admitting defeat.Good episode.

            To pester you just a bit more this p.m., thanks so much for that link. Greer is absolutely correct. I had heard nothing of the Enid recall result, but it comes as no surprise.Greer did not state it but his implicit conclusion is it will take a lot more pain before anything happens substantively. I do think there is a sorting, dissolution and fragmentation underway, largely for unvoiced and possibly unconscious reasons, and that is somewhat of a white pill, but the black pill is those sorting and dissolving and fragmenting are immersed in the same cultural poison. Most likely cannot be detoxed.

        Here I am to piss in everybody’s punchbowl.  (And this will be a long, tl;dr comment.) I thought Z’s stellar podcast used the theoretical (early American transcendentalists and fakers like Thoreau) to illustrate today’s physical and social dichotomy of suburban versus rural life.  Everyone else seems to have gone off into the ether of American literature and what they read in junior high.  Hint – I had to read all that stuff too – and I hated much of it.  It’s why I was an English English major – better writers and thinkers, with much more panache.  Plus I minored in Russian so that I, too, could pose as a deep and depressed thinker.Literary pretensions aside, let’s get back to the real world.  The one of now not so sterile suburbs and rural shacks.  Zman – Bravo.  Everyone – I mean everyone – looks at the photos of our property and gushes “I would LOVE to live there!”  Except, of course, that Betsy has her cheer camp and Bobby is in his SAT prep class, and Bob Senior relies on the local sports medicine guy, and Karen would be lost without her quilting group.  They all have this sanitized vision of a rural paradise – a strange symbiotic cross between summer camp and their terribly sophisticated group of diverse numerkan neighbors.  Or, as Zman put it, living the ideal suburban life but with a rural aesthetic.And that’s without mentioning the dreaded retirees – who think the world is their playground and everyone and everything exists to cater to their needs.  They want a pastoral paradise – without the real, hard-working people who live and work here.  Just who in the hell do they think built the roads through the wilderness and established the ‘first’ local mill or hardware store?  Unlike the suburbs – with their shopping malls, multi-plex movie theaters, and ethnic restaurants – small towns were not built for anyone’s convenience or entertainment.  They were built by the locals’ ancestors – to get their grain or animals to market, to share the cost of establishing electricity or schooling.Absolutely the suburbs have a hidden support network – not to mention the large, diverse, dangerous and decaying cities they cluster around.  Our former suburb was rotten with corporate headquarters – all displaying a tasteful and non-religious Christmas ornament at the appropriate season, and a rainbow flag to sooth the social conscience.  And the places were absolute ghost towns at the height of the scamdemic, as all the AWFLs and H-1bs cowered behind their masks in their McMansions.As Zman astutely notes, too many of these new rural fantasists genuinely believe “it takes a village,” in direct contradiction of their supposed race realism and genetic sophistication.  People, you will have high IQ kids if you have the right genetics.  And they still may be incredibly stupid about real life and lacking common sense, not to mention any concrete abilities.  Hint:  You can raise decent, competent kids without your oh-so-sophisticated crowd in Boulder or Austin. It just takes an old-fashioned thing known as parenting.  My kids were the last in their private Christian schools to get cell phones, and they never saw the latest movie or tv show all the others were talking about.  And yes, they resented me then, and thank me now.  Environment does matter, but not in the way these new aesthetes think.It matters because one’s kids need to see and deal with real people and real life.  To perhaps raise and love an animal, and still know it’s destined for one’s table and why.  To know that one neighbor grades the road and another a mile away is the local dentist.  To have a sense of rootedness.  To know the volunteer firemen who rides his engine in the local Thanksgiving parade is the guy who sits next to you at church.  To realize it takes people at the margins – poor and comfortable, blue collar and hipster – to make a real life community.  And that supporting those margins – the bottom and top 10% – requires a lot of ordinary White people. Normal people.  Not all brilliant, not all perfect – who do the day to day work of keeping civilization functioning for the divorced mom in the shack and the hipster with her local antique shop (yeah, met one of those from Rhode Island, for God’s sake – one place I will not be patronizing again).Of course, if you remain committed to the current paradigm, and plan on sending your kids to college and your princess to law school, then you do need to stay (oh please, please do) in the suburbs or city where all the sophisticated folks live.  Fact:  There are fewer resources (educational, entertainment, etc.) in a rural area.  There isn’t a huge safety net.   Working class people . . . work.  And if you are extremely outgoing and like to host fancy parties, you may not like it in the country.  Stay in Boulder or find a retirement community in Florida or Arizona.  You will feel much more at home.  And if you need/demand the latest medical tech and care, please stay home.  I’m sick of reading of the 84 year old who embarked on a world cruise (and all the people say “You go girl!  Live your best life!”) but forgot her medications.  I’ve dealt with that reality as a consular officer.  The world – the real one – is NOT your oyster.  Stop growing old without growing up  . . . Boomer.I’ve seen too many YT videos of people who moved to what they thought was their rural paradise, only to feel lonely and ‘excluded’ and to return home, complaining those rural people won’t ‘accept outsiders.’  I have no illusions that I will ever be a genuine oldtime local, but then I didn’t come here to visit or party on a pension.  Yes, the original settlers/homesteaders had to deal with loneliness – and if you are expecting to immediately be invited to someone’s game night or ladies group, you will be disappointed.  You are expected to take care of yourself, and your extended family.  Everyone will lend a hand when needed, but you are not going to have anyone hold your hand and to gushingly make you feel welcome.One of our neighbor’s complaint about our predecessors was that they were constantly calling for help or advice.  We call at times, too, but more often our neighbors check in with us to see if we are okay because we tend to keep to ourselves.  My husband and I are . . . let’s call it emotionally self-sufficient.  We enjoy each other’s company.  We’ve already done the diplomatic dinner parties and fancy receptions.  Now, we want to be away from people.  Sure – my husband has his business trips and even his every-day  remote job which provide more than enough interaction with other people.  We miss our closest friends.  But every time we return to the ‘burbs and the city, we cannot wait to get away and back home.  Learn to enjoy the quiet and alone time – and don’t move here.In summation (I did warn this would be a long comment), don’t move without doing a cost/benefit analysis.  What you are willing to give up, and what you will gain.  What is an absolute necessity, and what is only a want.  Know yourself and your genuine expectations.  If you want the latest in cutting-edge tech and music and museums, if you want a top-ranked high school, then don’t move rural.  Go somewhere like Austin . .. with its Jewish mayor, its homeless encampments, its increasing black and mestizo crime – and tell yourself you have the best of both worlds.I’ll stick with the woods and the bugs (which I don’t like) and the plain-spoken hillbillies.  These are genuine people – and they do their jobs competently and with general good will – because that is who they are.  I like that the men all open doors for me or tease me (with my grey hair) as “young lady.”  I like that the cashier at the neighborhood store now greets me as a regular.  I also know just how blessed we are – we can enjoy all the benefits of a rural life on a suburban salary, because my husband can work remotely.  We live 3 miles off the paved road  . . . but we have fiber optic internet.  Rural relocation is a real thing, but look before you leap. We have not registered to vote or signed up at the local dem/repuke headquarters.  But we have enjoyed a meal at the local VFW lodge and we don’t mock the service of anyone’s ancestor – because this is their community with its own history, traditions, and values.  We appreciate being part of it – even on the margins – but we aren’t here to foster a revolutionary circle or radicalize the populace.  I drop a few tidbits here and there, but I’m not here on a mission to change anyone.I treasure this remnant of heritage America, and I fear for its future.   So call me an escapee or a refugee, but don’t come here and think you have the secret to establish an all new community of the like-minded.  Communities don’t grow like that.  And more importantly, they don’t last like that.

            ” We have not registered to vote or signed up at the local dem/repuke headquarters. ”Good. There should be a law that you can only vote for the office you qualify for having been at least the 3rd generation. So if you move within your state, you can still vote for president,  governor and senator. But nothing else.  “Oh, I love this new place. Much better than where I came from.  Now let me screw it up by voting”I agree with much of what you said.  However, you are very lucky to be in a functional rural community.  So much of rural America is just royally screwed.  Many formerly middle class normal White towns’ main source of income is now meth, heroin and drug treatment programs. Of course, all the other stuff that comes with it.My big city at least is just as bad.  There is still enough wealth generated in the city to sort of mask it, somewhat, but welfare and drugs and drug treatment and the medical industrial complex are huge part of the city’s (Philadelphia) economy.  When I was growing up, all the factories were just starting to close. Philly had factories everywhere.  Now they’re all rotting husks or torn down or converted into apartments.Most of my family ran to the suburbs a long time ago.  I absolutely hate even visiting the suburbs.  When I leave, it’s going to be a rural area in another part of the country. I’m tired of running short distances. You cannot escape in that way.  I definitely won’t be voting.

                I’ve long believed that “red states” as we call them should be passing tougher citizenship laws to establish residency and voting rights in state elections.  i.e. you’re not a voting-eligible citizen in Texas until you’ve lived there 25 years…that sort of thing.The best thing Colorado did back in the early 1990’s was pass the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR).  It has neutered Denver in ways that still drive them insane today.  Every 2 years we get another bizarre attempt to unravel TABOR.  Last year it was “give up your rights to your TABOR refund and we won’t crush you on property taxes”.  It lost 70-30 like most attempts to kill TABOR.  People who don’t know what TABOR is: growth in state spending is limited to inflation rates and population growth.  ANY tax revenues collected above the TABOR caps are sent back to taxpayers in cash.  My kids (who all work) each got an $800 sales tax refund, for example (as did my wife and I).It’s an example of passing legislation when Team Red controls things that cannot be easily undone by Team Blue.  And it hamstrings Team Blue’s attempts to screw us all over.  TABOR is a beautiful thing…but it was passed in 1992 when Bill Owens was Governor.Unfortunately, Democrats got control of the legislature in 2005 and passed mail-in voting.  We have won exactly one statewide office since (Cory Gardner, a one-term Senator).George Bush turned Colorado red in 2004 and Democrats decided they were no longer going to allow free and fair elections in Colorado.  It’s hailed as a “model for the nation”, but nobody ever talks about how Republicans haven’t won a significant election here in many years.Red States have probably missed the boat by now, but were I king for a day, every Red state would be passing nearly-impossible-to-undo TABORs, eliminating mail-in voting, and requiring in-person proof of identity voting with no “early” voting allowed.Best case?  You don’t get to vote in a state or local election until you’ve lived there for a minimum of 5 years.  You can vote National issues, but no local ones.

                    This is great.  I’ve independently been commenting that red states should ban government housing and immigration at the state level, as well as all kinds of proxies for liberals to scare the minorities and liberals off.  If red states can give homeless people a bus ticket to California, why can’t they do it for the basketball Americans and the liberals? Go live on someone else’s dole.  They’ll see a reduction in crime, totally unrelated.

            We kind of “half way”’d it.  A couple acres on the fringe of the burbs.  We aren’t ready to go remote, at least not yet.  It’s quiet all day and dark at night.  The city sprawls at the horizon, but it is “over there”.  The small town up the road a mile has a few local shops and a couple restaurants.  Still getting used to that, but we’re emotionally secure as well.  Me, my wife, a dog, and peace and quiet.  Our youngest is 18 and moving out soon to a halfway house. (college). The other two are grown and off building their lives.  I love that our neighbors still ride their houses in the open spaces.It’s hard to compare small town America today to what it was when I was a kid in the 70’s.  Although I try not to bring politics into everything with my kids, when we watch Star Wars it’s a movie about white people saving the galaxy.  I saw it a a drive in when I was 7.  The window speaker.  The bug spray.  The concession stand.  Folding the seats down to stretch out.  We’d fall asleep in the way-back driving home.  No car seats.  No indoctrination telling my kids they should try being gay.  I knew one divorced family up until I went to college at 18 when more of my college friends (not many, but more) came from split homes.We just came here for the peace and quiet.  I don’t know how long we’ll be allowed to keep it.

            Sterling, brilliant comment. I will buy your book, which surely will be shorter (just kidding!).As you may recall, I’m a native rural Southerner who lived abroad a long time with all the yadda, yadda, yadda that went with it. When we moved back here decades ago, it actually was an initial cultural shock even though it was home. Now the only thing I regret is the time we spent away.During the first wave of internal migrants/Yankees, a popular local bumper sticker was I DON’T CARE HOW YOU DID IT UP NORTH. This latest wave largely has not been those types, although every now and then they venture into that territory and, unlike in the past, get slapped around when they do (experience is the greatest teacher, the once-generous-to-a-fault locals discovered.I’m glad you and your family have successfully relocated, and, most of all, you don’t need a bumper sticker to ground you. I’ve seen other exceptionally bright people who did need them, which is mind-blowing, but, people.GREAT comment, again, and not at all excessively long given the valuable information therein.

                Jack:  Many thanks.  I actually listened to Zman’s podcast today, and jotted a few notes because I thought it was so en pointe and I wanted to address them.  And being lazy, I didn’t want to go back and edit and condense.

                    It was a particularly good and insightful podcast today and I do need to leave a complete reply to it this weekend if I get a chance. Sometimes I think Z just claims to ad lib his best spots, but he’s a pretty straight up guy so he’s likely being truthful.I’m glad you didn’t condense, by the way, because some things do need to be fleshed out. To add to my last reply, the worst thing you could have done, and wisely did not, was act as an evangelist on the issues of the day to the locals. Eventually you will realize that many of them actually do apprehend the same things that trouble us but are reticent to express an opinion. That once was simultaneously a weakness and a strength, and now more or less is simply the latter.Again, glad the move worked out for you all. As you know, it is not a panacea but the best and perhaps the only rational response to present circumstances.

            3g4me, God bless your wisdom. That gray hair was honestly come by. I don’t know if anyone ever slung a “Physician heal thyself” in your face; but I get the feeling you would be more than justified in saying “Been there, done that, got the t-shirt.” We are kindred spirits; and I hope my own experiment in choosing a final place fares as well as your’s seems to have done.

        The real problem with this guy is that Appalachia didn’t “just happen.”  The things he is looking for caused Appalachia. They caused Kensington ave.  They caused all the awful things we see across the US.  He’s not escaping Appalachia, he’s CAUSING it.When he’s bellyaching about the social problems he sees in others, he should remember them when he’s hiring some brown guy to mow his lawn, some brown woman to babysit his kids and buys some made in China junk in the bigbox corporations sucking wealth out of communities across the US.  The people he complains about are the former middle class.  Now they’re the underclass with all the problems of the underclass.Not to mention the movement of people. Everyone is from somewhere else now.  How many of the people in Austin are from Austin?  Probably very few have been there a full generation, let alone 3.  This sucks talent out of small localities.  Where before they work in the town’s big company as an engineer or management, now they just move to somewhere else.  Anyone who can gets out of town and the only thing left are the people who can’t leave.

        As a guy working at an industrial plant as a maintenance tech, I think my co-workers and operators would agree that we want management to stay as far away from us as possible. So the feeling between the managerial class and us is mutual. They stay in their admin building and we stay here.

            Once upon a time, in a refinery long long ago, an operator got killed in an industrial accident involving malfunctioning equipment. After the uh-oh squad finished their concern dance, I got called in to make sure it never happened again. First, I asked the guys in the field what they thought should be done. Then consulted with the “wise” old-timers in the main office. Both opinions were unrealistic fantasies, so I just focused on reality and acted accordingly. Problem fixed (but not cheap) and my reward was to be ostracized as a heretic.Everyone has a place in the puzzle of life.

        Excellent podcast today. Loads of wisdom were dispensed. Zman’s voice has always settled quite well on the ears, yet it was notably soothing during this episode. He has carved out a remarkable niche of his own among sociopolitical commentators. Dare I say he “transcends” the standard rhetoric of this age?

        Great podcast, now let’s go deeper into root causes.Affluent civilization begets the death of hardship, existential gauntlets, and the culling that drives fitness evolution. Absence of culling enables pathogens and parasites to thrive, and ultimately pose a lethal threat to the host. And yes, this model applies at the societal level, not just for individuals and tribes.We need environments (towns, villages, cities) that reinvigorate culling in some palatable form such that our DNA improves with each succeeding generation. And how to get there is no easy problem. Education, persuasion, and voting have been failing spectacularly for centuries now, so persistence on this path will only delay the inevitable colony collapse. There is a better way.The solution begins with the acknowledgement that the pathogens are now in charge. And parasites always prioritize their survival above all else.

        There’s another line from Emerson to our thing, nothing like what we think of when we remember transcendentalism from school. My teachers were boomers, so Emerson, like all historical good guys, was a hippie. And some current righty trad stuff is reminiscent of that*. But also, the genealogy of “right-accelerationism” is Emerson &gt; Nietzsche &gt; Deleuze &gt; Land &gt; any variation of “Collapse is necessary and will necessitate (or at least whisper, to some) what’s next.”That’s not how anyone actually got here. Deleuze is a car-sized pothole in that road. His most ardent disciples don’t read him. But that’s the essay. Enterprising youth, take this log and build a Substack innawoods!*Some leftists have noticed this and gone back, re-revising hippiedom to represent patriarchy/whiteness/Germany—as it has before. Looking for a way to condemn the sexual revolution for helping ugly dudes get laid, gen x feminists spotted the origin of “the sixties” in proto-nazi nature boy stuff**. All must retvrn.**Academic feminism is “My professor lied when he said he’d leave his wife for me” turned into a field of study.

            It is almost unbearably funny that hippiness, “back to nature,” nudity, seems to have many Germanic roots.  How would the stern failed painter explain this?
(Long ago, I had a wonderful hippie girlfriend whose ancestry was 100% German.  Don’t get me started on my memories of her…)
These are expressions of the Volk, which must be accommodated in any nation that gives voice to the people.  The question is, “How can we allow the expression to these hippy feelings without dooming ourselves to suicidal utopianism?”

Speaking as one who would have qualified as a hippy in my late teens (and incidentally, am of majority German lineage), it’s not difficult at all. In my case, I grew up. So I guess the question is how do you make others grow up.

                Limited war allowed warrior/honor culture to thrive (and counterbalance the hippy and the nerd) in a way sportsball hasn’t.
That started ending when the revolutionary French went total war, culminating in the Nazi sperg-out reaction about a nation not fighting and expanding is dying, or something like that. Now warrior culture is anathema, so we’re left with the hippy and the nerd.
Guessing off the top of my head.

        A family is not a 20 year event.  You have to find a spouse for your children so that your progeny is elevated instead of immiserated. It must be somewhere that your kids can join you and you can be a grandparent, and hopefully a great grandparent, instead of an occasional casual visitor. You must be a good custodian of your family heritage by sowing your seed in a fertile field, not casting it upon the rocks or amongst the thornbushes. You have to be somewhere where there is a sufficient pool of quality people for your sons and daughters to find a mate. Deliberately finding and keeping that is a huge task and burden.  Kudos to that guy for trying (tho we looked at and rejected Austin bc a different judgment on where TX and Austin are headed, ie mestizo anarchy).So Zman; walk a mile in his shoes first. The future is for those who show up, and it sounds like his family’s progeny will show up.Frankly, we have a Daniel Penny problem. The white underclass is not yet racially on-sides yet.  Once the trailer doors are never locked because an IRA man may be running from the Dublin Constabulary, then cohesive communities will be possible. As it is, the underclass will happily tell the rainbow Gestapo who is hiding naughty thoughts in their attic.

            “ A family is not a 20 year event. You have to find a spouse for your children…”Spot on.  I was of the opinion that everything would settle down and we’d be free when the kids went off to college.  Boy was I wrong.  Fortunately I married a smarter and better person than me.  She now is super grandma, but always to fill in the gaps where the kids need help—like the time between semesters at the private schools the grandkids attend.When the grand children “visit”, we go with the program—TV stays off, no electronics allowed, reading and some simple board games played.  Grandpa sets out the chores—feeding the dogs, putting away toys, yardwork, etc.  This will undoubtedly continue until we die, which hopefully will be after the grandchildren reach adulthood.  However, we had children late, and that’s been a topic discussed here as well.  😉

        The American Renaissance is probably the era of American writing I know the most about. I would not say that Emerson rejected empiricism; rather, I contend her perceived the shortcoming as the industrial era continued to reshape society. I believe that this message is essential in the current moment, for the inability to trust intuition and individual experience of profundity is one of the disabilities the average American possesses.To be fair, I haven’t listened to the podcast yet (Google Podcast stopped working today, so I must find another app), but I hope you recognize the value of the Romantics. The belief that exists an ideal beyond the pale of the everyday, material (in both senses of that word) experience is one of the medicines for the modern world.Romanticism, of which Transcendentalism is a byproduct of, is the rejection of the materialism that Marx founded his history upon, and which we base our modern morality, such as it is, on.

            Eloi: “…the inability to trust intuition and individual experience of profundity is one of the disabilities the average American possesses…”Intuition lives in the Amygdala, and is now largely unique to the Red States; whereas fantasy &amp; delusion &amp; mesmerizability &amp; hypnotizability are now largely unique to the Blue States:https://tinyurl.com/5t44x5n7What I fear is that pharmaceutical agents such as Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors [SSRIs] are silencing the voice of Reason in the Amygdala, and possibly even amplifying the voice of Insanity in the Insula, and are pushing White sh!tlib personalities into chemically-induced psychopathy &amp; maybe even sadism.G0d only knows what would happen if China and/or India were to cut off the flow of the SSRIs.[Because apparently we don’t make our own pharmceuticals anymoar, at least not after they reach the 18th-year mark, and their patents expire.]Anyway, my point would be that White sh!tlibs [on SSRIs] very likely have indeed lost the ability to experience “intuition”.Regarding “individual experience of profundity”, however, we’ve still got the Cluster B pandemic to bolster the sh!tlib ego.Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s ego was so massive that she refused to step down, and caused her side to lose control of the Supreme Court.And now Sonia Sotomayor is showing signs of the very same burning seething white-hot Cluster B in her own personalititty.===============It would be a fascinating study to see how SSRI dependency correlates with Cluster B, and I don’t know in which direction the causality would tend to push [or pull].You would think that SSRIs would tend to quell Cluster B, but our lengthy body of empirical data points [over the course of the last 30 or 35 years] would seem to indicate otherwise. There were an handful of very small studies about two decades ago, but not much in the recent literature [that I can see].

                Once in my twenties, while under an incredible amount of stress (so bad I had exploding head syndrome), I relented and took some SSRI’s. After a week, I tossed them. They made me have unsettling thoughts and a disconnect I could recognize as dangerous. I have no doubt most modern spree killers are on them. (This, of course, being the reason medical records are sealed.)As to your account on ego and profundity, I would say that I believe in an objective reality experienced subjectively. I understand they flatter themselves subjectively, but that, objectively, they understood nothing.

                Bourbon, spot on.Say what you will about Jordan Peterson, but on the above topic he’s a good example (of a bad example).  In his early writings he *praised* SSRI’s and how they “helped” him in his life.  I remember reading such and thing “WTF”.  Then, a few short years later, he was on death’s doorstep due to the continued use/abuse of them, and he needed to be airlifted to Russia to find a detox protocol for these poisons.  Literally months spent on death’s doorstep being slowly weaned off of these mind altering poisons.  He seems well now wrt his mind, but somehow not the same person as previously.  Perhaps he simply has a better understanding of his limitations without drug enhancement.My concierge family physician is up front in these matters.  He bluntly states when you sign up that he will not prescribe/treat with pain medication, nor anti-depressants.  Since I do not subscribe to either myself, we are a perfect fit.  But I do appreciate where he’s coming from when I continuously read about the effects of these “drugs” on fragile personalities.—especially fragile personalities in possession of firearms.  🙁There is no “pill” for life.

                    It was benzodiapines, not SSRI’s that Peterson had to go through an arduous withdrawal from. As bad as SSRI’s can be, an addiction to benzos is much worse.

                        What Peterson expressly wrote about and praised was *SSRI’s*. Of that I’m certain.  What he crashed hard on was indeed, benzodiazepine (or derivative).  Sorry if there is a confusion, but I consider it “a distinction without a difference” to the point being made. The point remains, to wit, the taking of psychoactive pharmaceuticals is not without risk and certainly over prescribed.I roomed with a guy as a freshman in the dorm who had a bottle filled with Stellazine (Thorazine lite) among any number of other prescriptions. This guy was loopy as all hell and finally was forcibly removed to the hospital for psyc eval.  He never returned to the dorm.Those were the days in the early 70’s where we all taught that insanity was due to chemical imbalances in the brain.  “Madness and the brain“, by Solomon Snyder,  was required reading at the time for psych majors.  Hell, even I got excited, over this new form of treatment—but I was young then and knew no better.  We also didn’t have school shootings and the like either and 40+ years of further studies, evaluation, and retrospection.We do now, so did Peterson before he poisoned himself.

                        Yes, you are correct. Bene’s, but it was I remember distinctly SSRI’s Jordan wrote about.  He was in the bag for psychotropics early on, which I found surprising given my impression of the man’s intellect.  A dangerous crutch indeed.

Agree mostly but European romanticism itself is part of European esoteric currents of the late 18th and early 19 centuries. But I would be going too far afield to write about these here. Various books on the relatively new area of scholarly endeavor of “Western esotericism” going into this more deeply (e.g., Faivre, Hanegraff, Versluis, Stuckrad).

                Absolutely, and Transcendentalism features esoteric elements. I believe there there is an ideal, spiritual realm, and we occasionally catch glimpses of it, if we are observant. This is inherently subjective, the basis of one aspect of the esoteric. Now, I am not saying I am an Emersonian, becoming a transparent eyeball, and I do not believe in an oversoul, but I do believe that there are currents beyond the material (but not simply rejecting the material; thus, not simply a rejection of empiricism). Nor, to be clear, am I saying I support the wicked practices of esoteric groups (Illuminati/ Rosicrucian, Kabbalah, etc.).From my limited perspective, they tap into spiritual forces that exist for evil purposes. I believe that this ability to experience some aspect of divinity (again – I do not believe humans are – a key distinction from the Satanists and esoteric groups – and Emerson) is real. I also believe that this perception is limited (aligning me with the dark Romantics), and that we are too fallen to experience appropriately or comprehend.This is why Moby Dick is my favorite novel. The appreciation of the experience of divine proximity reigned in with classic religious stricture, all the while musing upon the inability to grasp the profound while still striving to experience it.

            “The American Renaissance is probably the era of American writing I know the most about.”Eloi, why did the Transcendentalists emphasize individualism so much?  Emerson’s best known work is “Self-Reliance,” after all.It all seems so foolish.  The reason they were not tortured to death by the natives was because of their collectivism.  Thoreau could only write Walden because Emerson let him live on his land.  How “self-reliant” of him.I tend to regret the time I spent reading those guys because they seem to lack self-awareness as much as some black who thinks that they won a formal debate by rapping.

                I place the work in context. I think Walden (Thoreau, I know) is largely nonsense. Some beautiful passages, yes. I think Emerson’s actual spiritual beliefs are nonsense, though he does have some great speeches (I really like the Harvard Commencement Address – the sun shines today, also).I should be more careful to explain that the Transcendentalists offered another angle to the world that the empiricists (such as Locke, Hobbes, and Bacon) had come to dominate and stifle the world in the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution.As mentioned above, I am no Transcendentalist. I am no prepper. But I am someone, as we all are here (except the trolls), who rejects the morality shoved down our throats by TPTB. Transcendentalists are the most obvious counterpoint to the empirical, managerial world we live in (caricatures though they are).Again, I love Melville and Hawthorne. Those are writers I actually identify with. I believe, however, that when considering the ills our society has (pure Tabula Rasa empiricism and its resultant utilitarianism), the Romantics offer a compliment: the soul. The Transcendentalists offer a caricatured vision of what is lost. Who admires the field and the sky anymore? Who truly listens to the beat of their own drum? Who hears something profound in the call of the birds? Who recognizes that there are things beyond the material?I was driving to work and the podcast app was not working. I put on my tunes, and Paul Simon’s “Still Crazy After All These Years” came on. I don’t care for Simon in most cases, but I had not heard it in years, and the arrangement and chords are spectacular.I listened to it as I came over a hill as the sun was rising. I thought about a girlfriend from 20 years ago, and what it would be like if I ran into her now, and I smiled. The music, the sun, and the memory added up to more than the sum of their parts. Empiricism cannot account for that, not in my mind. That is what the Transcendentalists offer: the gateway for young minds to recognize this, particularly when we keep in mind that this celebration of beauty is lost on the masses, hence the need for individualism. You understand the Transcendentalists so you can appreciate the concept of there existing more, then you read Shakespeare and Melville in order to recognize how they more gracefully straddle that line.

                    Your post is delightful in that it grasps at the ephemeral, as much as we are able.
(Oh, all those lost girlfriends from 20 years ago!  Paul Simon has done some breathtaking work.)
I tend towards brutal empiricism and I appreciate you reminding me of what I sometimes overlook.

                And, sorry to dominate the posting today, but I love this topic. I do not use the American Renaissance and Transcendentalism interchangeably.For me, all of the writers of the era were wrestling with the key issue of an American voice and an empirical mindset. I find this tension fascinating. Poe even wrote a poem about how the scientist has killed poetic sensibility.What is ironic, or appropriate, is that Poe, Melville, and Hawthorne, much like Edwards in “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” used science and the techniques of the scientist in order to highlight the shortcomings of human perception. The transcendentalists felt that humans were limitless beings. Melville, Poe, and Hawthorne heartily disagreed, albeit in their individual ways. I love the discussion in general, but I agree with the Dark Romantics.

                    Are you familiar with Poe’s Eureka?  I haven’t read it, but from what I’ve heard, it seems to address your greatest interest:  a romantic trying to come to terms with the successes of the scientific revolution.

                        I absolutely have. I first heard about it with the claim he predicted the Big Bang Theory in this piece. I find it perfectly emblematic of works such as “A Descent into the Maelstrom,” where the author confronts divinity with rationalism. I believe his approbation of the limits of science, and how he fills in the gaps, is a perfect indictment of the limits of science. I find it, however, a bit unmoored, while still interesting. His reliance of terms as the basis of reasoning was, to me, a failure. Words are ersatz.

        Spectacular, Z. You are right – there is a LOT of fuzzy thinking going on in the prepper/off grid/parallel society camps and you hit the nail right on the head with all of them.But… I wonder if maybe you missed the boat with our young exile with the Twatter poast? Is he seeking an impossible Utopia? Or is he seeking his tribe? People in the country towns get clannish and mistrustful of outsiders and it takes a certain personality profile to parachute into their communities and make a go of it. (You could do it, I would suspect).I dunno about you but I started looking around at my circle 10 or 15 years ago… and I started seeing aliens. Over time they morphed into what you describe as “spiteful mutants”.  As the glorious New World Order has unfurled they got weirder and weirder. These are not stupid people either – they’re affluent, successful technical and professional people. I had to get away; they lived on a different plane of existence than I did. My inlaws became virtue signaling authoritarian communists. My parents became eccentric and erratic. Us younger ones started breaking away from our families and each other. Then our kids broke away from us. And curiously there was no happy middle ground for any of us to tolerate each other. It is a point of pride for me to say I was first to get banished from Hive World – but then they started exiling each other and it was all so mean and nasty. I dunno what in hell happenedI’ve thought along the same lines as you in that our affluent lifestyle is corrupting us. None of this would ever have happened in the Before Times. It was too important to keep the family together for the welfare of all… but all that is gone now, Women can flip off their husbands and cash in or at least count on the welfare state. Kids don’t learn anything at school and any concept of discipline was thrown out 50 years ago. We are so rich and wealthy that some of us have nothing better to do than obsess over our genitals and annoy our neighbours with them.Perhaps we’re all right? You are correct in saying our concept of Utopia doesn’t exist and that any life we make for ourselves has to have pro and con aspects. Torba is right in that we need to starve our enemies and strengthen ourselves and our brothers? And the kid on Twatter is right in seeking a tribe that aligns with his worldviews and opinions.Have a great weekend dissidents.

            The prepper thing gets me. I have a shelf of Ayn Rand and a shelf of libertarian fantasy novels from the long-long ago. Neithet of them are “me” anymore. And having thought through “off grid” at length, it is a suicidal idea.  Ask Randy and Uncle Ted: there is no such thing as running far enough to escape the Eye of Sauron. Galt’s Gulch would be Donner Pass with fancy tobacco. You must live in the world, though not be of it.  BUT, the system is fragile and you must be a good steward. You cannot just stuff your face with twinkies and Monster Energy that you buy one at a time, right? We must think of our great grandparents, who when the store didnt have more bread that week still got by without starving. The prepper stuff shares space with that, but is of a different moral and practical mindset.  I realize that if I cannot get 5 gallons of gasoline for my generator, stuff has gone so sideways that there is nothing that I can do to “prep.” I cannot prepare to live completely autonomously from all modern technology and society without destroying my family (and probably not even then). Randy Weaver’s kids dont live where they were raised.If I cannot get to the grocery store once every 2 weeks, I will be too busy sniping muties or trying to connect an old Apple laptop to the aliens’ mothership to care, and have no course but to trust in God’s mercy.

                There is an in between.  You prep to “shelter in place”.  The assumptions being to take care of yourself until things settle down enough for some restoration to take place of basic infrastructure.  This may also not take place and you’ll only prolong the agony.  YMMV.

Long before you get to the point that you cannot get those 5 gallons of gasoline, it’s become far too valuable for other uses than running a few lights and binge watching Buffy. Indeed, the sound of a running generator is a zombie magnet…
You don’t have to live autonomously. Focus on non-fragile.

                    I believe you are making my point.  I dont see serious people discussing moving to a cave in the desert to eat bugs and contemplate the void until the Big Flash gets them anymore; thats just people selling goofy books and supplements to the gullible.  But the Z podcast expressed perplexity at the Twitter guy’s “sustainability” in a suburban setting. This is an “ant versus grasshopper” thing that rejects the false dichotomy of “you’re a sheeple if you arent living alone on a mountain with a Main Battle Rifle but without indoor plumbing.”  Since the ‘rona, most white people with something on the ball now have a stack of TP “just in case.”  Levels vary based on individual circumstances. But it’s an “our culture” thing, and should be accepted and not mocked. If the hubby has a plate carrier and the wifey has a stack of canned goods in the pantry, they are on the Narrow Path towards Truth and Beauty.

In my 60+ years, I’ve lived in every sort of place from huge metros in California’s Bay Area to a town of 10,000 in what could easily be described as the Appalachia of northern California.Cities spawn crime and cultural filth because the anonymity and diversity create a pervasive depersonalization that transforms individuals into generic consumers. Sometimes you can intentionally band together with a few like-minded folk to foster an oasis of meaning and purpose in the urban chaos; but you still have to have a strong stomach for the mutants and their ways.My experience of the suburbs was similar to the ethos described by Zman. The filth is tidily kept out of sight, but remains hidden beneath the surface. But the anonymity and concomitant loneliness are enhanced because everyone retreats to their personalized palate of homes and tech gadgets and foodie experiences. It’s analogous to getting a tattoo. What’s unique is the design; what’s generic is the decision to get one. Rinse, lather, repeat across a wide range of choices. People either fail to connect because they cling to the myth that they can be hyper-unique, so unable or unwilling to connect; or they are in fact so bland and familiar that there’s nothing special to make a connection attractive.Then, we come to the small town. Locals who’ve been there, sometimes for generations, are slow to trust newcomers. There’s a lot of probing and testing, including questions about who your parents and grandparents are/were and where you’re from and why you left. People can be quick to cut you socially and try to shame you for even minor transgressions of local custom. Shame is how they police their problem people: the drunks and drug addicted, the lazy, the crooked business owner, etc. They don’t have the resources to either try and incarcerate them or provide therapeutic treatment. You will have to rub elbows with some unsavory folk. As Zman shared, the poverty and lack of education will often be on stark display. The cruel reality is that it’s mostly tolerable because everybody understands that some people are better than others; and, if they don’t understand that hierarchy, they are quickly made to and told pointedly just about where they fall in the ranks.I found that I could make friends easily and was generally respected as someone who was providing a valuable service to the community; but certain doors were never going to be open to me because no one had known my grandfather. And anyone who was socially prominent knew my comings and goings like clockwork. It felt kind of weird to be asked by the police chief why I’d been talking for more than a passing moment with the manager of the (yes, only one) supermarket. Initially, when this kinda thing happened, I’d be puzzled why anyone would care. But such gossip is the way problems that might require a response are identified. It greases the wheel.So, I guess my advice would be to prioritize people over place; but be honest with yourself about how much reality you want to see, hear and tolerate. Don’t fool yourself that you can tolerate bad people, or bad weather, for the sake of buying a more affordable house. If you’re wrong, that house may become a self-imposed prison.

                It really does take a village. I grew up in a small town of 1200 with no access out or in except by boat or plane, so you needed either money or a large boat. Everyone knew whose kid you were and it was not unusual to come home and have my mother meet me at the door with “And just what were you doing hanging around the insert location here?”. Someone had seen me and called her, knowing that I was not supposed to be there. It also worked the other way, as we all knew whose truck NOT to get into when offered a ride home..

        Great show Zman!  I actually enjoyed the more off the cuff shows from time to time.One absolutely vital subtopic from the entire show is the ignorance that most folks under 40 have of the origin of the history of Western thought, culture, and philosophy.  Perhaps I am living among the hoi polloi, but I know very few people who own or read books at all.When folks come by to visit they are always shocked by the number of books I own.  Inevitably they ask, “Have you read all these?”  It really blows their mind when I assure them that not only have I read every single one of the thousands of books in my domicile, but I have read all of them multiple times.  I would not own a copy of a book if it was not worth re-reading!Of course I recognized the opening quote in the show immediately.  But then in high school (a very run of the mill public school mind you in a small Southern town) we read Thoreau, Emerson, Whitman, Faulkner, Longfellow, Hardy, Dickens, Scott, Shakespeare, Frost, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Poe, etc. just to name a few.I had a jarring experience at work the other day when I mentioned to a group of under 40’s that the “writing was on the wall” regarding a certain situation.  Do you know not a single person got the reference to the book of Daniel?  And when I said: “You know Mene Mene Tekel Uparsin!”, they stared at me like a mule looking at a new gate (as they say around here).To paraphrase:  Those who do not study the history of Western culture are doomed to make the same mistakes made in the past.  Over and over and over.

            Herm… how deep do we have to go, A? I am 60 and I got the “writing on the wall” but missed that second one and will have to look it up.But… I think I will survive. Through this and other sites I have access to clarity of thought almost on par with that that went into the writing of the Bible.The kind of lunacy destroying us in our day is not going to be fixed by reading more academic books – it will require busted skulls, stretched necks and heated exchanges of steel and shot. Critical thinking and reason have nothing to do with it.

At the time though, I universally gave them a hard time.Once we were tasked to read “Thanatopsis” by William Bryant, which was a sort of soothing meditation on death. I wrote a page explaining that the entire essay was cope, death was never peaceful and likely violent, and once you’re dead it doesn’t matter if parts of you become the ground, you’re still dead.If I wrote it in modern times, they would probably send me to the school psychologist.

            Yes.Extremely important point that is not emphasized enough. I practically grew up in libraries reading books. I got a damn good liberal arts education. As a high-schooler and undergrad I read stuff like Tocqueville, Thoreau, Twain, Shakespeare, Chaucer, the Federalist Papers, and so on. In grad school I read, and later as a professor taught, Plato, Aristotle, Marx, Nietzsche, Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes and Locke. In true Socratic fashion, the more I read, the more I became aware of what I didn’t know. I was in awe of the Victorian and Edwardian-era British academics who made careers out of studying Thucydides in the original Greek, or translated Caesar’s dispatches from Gaul or Cicero’s writings from Latin. They made me feel stupid by comparison. I read almost nothing of the contemporary left-wing shit. I remember in 1983 when a female professor assigned “The Color Purple,” as an 18-year old I thought it was complete crap and negro gibberish. I had read better literature in seventh grade.As a professor I made the mistake of laughing out loud when my female department chair made a reference to a paper she had written on Foucault. I later got fired.But kids don’t read ANYTHING any more. They don’t even try to struggle through it — even annotated excerpts or Cliff’s Notes. I noticed a palpable change in the students right about the time of Obama’s second term. They were glued to their cell phones, refused to do any work, and they were not inquisitive — but they sure were entitled. They assumed that if they registered for a course, they were entitled to get a passing grade, whether or not they did any reading, passed any exams, or attended any classes. They did not understand ANY references or idioms from classic literature, but they sure as hell know everything about sportsball, rappers, and celebrities. God forbid if you actually expected to make a black student do any work to get a passing grade or insult his lack of intelligence, Mr. White Professor, because some Karen from the administration would be down to break your balls in no time.(The best students I ever had were prison inmates, probably 75% of them black. They were adults, they had no access to the internet, no cell phones, and plenty of time to read. And they read what they were assigned word-for-word, in detail, over and over, and they were ready to discuss it. You had to be on your toes in class).And it’s not just students. Sen. Kennedy from Louisiana has done absolutely heroic work in committee hearings exposing the utter stupidity, ignorance, and incompetence of some of Biden’s minority and female nominees.If the university is the repository of Western culture and the Western literary canon, we are well and truly fucked as a culture.

This is the home life of my kids, well, outside of it being a prison. They can also play with Legos for hours. Removing instant dopamine hits does wonders, as it requires slow, methodical work to get the same sense of entertainment. The solution required, eliminating electronic media, is not hard, but no one is willing to do it.

                    Chet is correct – the dopamine flooding youths’ brains are causing the same thinning of the cortex as sustained cocaine use. No cell phones for my children (and I do not stare at them myself – otherwise, I am a gross hypocrite).

                “They did not understand ANY references or idioms from classic literature, but they sure as hell know everything about sportsball, rappers, and celebrities.”Yep, 35 years ago it seems we were all decrying the lack of “cultural literacy” (Professor E. D. Hirsch, Jr.)  coming about in the society.  I see this as “planned”—if you don’t know your past, you can’t object to your current situation, nor avoid an even worse future.I was blessed with being a part of the last generational cohort to have a grounding in the Western canon.  Not just in college, but in HS as well.  HS English class had us reading Shakespeare and Chaucer for example.  You not only learned about the literary definition of  a “tragedy” was, you read them directly as written by the greatest author in the English language.In university, my freshman year professor lecturing us in History called all the other disciplines taught, “the great pseudo sciences”.  Took me the better part of my life to understand the truth of his assertion.

Students do not know anything about the Civil War — or even what century it was in. They do not know anything about World War II or Pearl Harbor. They do not know that the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese. They do not know anything about the Vietnam War or even when it happened.Obviously SOME of them know SOME of that stuff, but many — perhaps most — do not. Those Mark Dice videos interviewing average morons in the street are no joke.Many of them have a lower level of literacy than I had in third grade — they do not capitalize proper nouns, they do not end sentences with periods, they do not use commas, they do not write paragraphs, and they do not write sentences with a subject, verb, and object.The last eight years that I taught in community college I refused to assign any written papers. I was not paid enough to attempt to decipher illiterate gibberish. I administered computer-graded multiple-choice exams… which were almost always graded on a curve.

PS–I wonder how much of the ignorance you describe centers upon vibrant students? I have no doubt whatsoever that white students, too, are of a far lower caliber than those of 30 years ago, but I imagine increased vibrancy levels have also powerfully exacerbated ignorance.

                        We often decry the programming that the youth are getting. There are many narratives about the Civil War for example, that most “educated” people believe. The South as pure evil, Lincoln as a demigod, etc… The impression that I get from many young people though, is that they do not have this programming. They don’t have *any* programming. They don’t have the “wrong” view of the Civil War but no idea it happened, just as you’ve observed. Their view of history must be as a series of random, disconnected events floating in a void with no causal linkages. This mirrors their “culture” – a mishmash of profane rap lyrics, bits of internet memes, capeshit movies, video games, “ideas” promoted by Instagram and Onlyfans whores. It must be a strange world indeed that they inhabit. I’m tempted to think of those stories I’ve read about feral children raised without language. The world is just a kaleidoscope of shifting colors, shapes, and sounds.

                        Ostei.  Yep, it’s across the board wrt student illiteracy.  I do not exclude Whites.  I do though forgive the few instances of poor form in this group as we are *all* guilty at times and time is short for response. Just like spelling and grammar errors, we have no ability to correct postings and the spell checker at times is a creative genius. 😉Xman.  As to writing paragraphs and expression of thought…yesterday I shared a story of tutoring college athletes (mostly Black).  Wife also assigned written papers—once!What was turned in, I got to look at.  The star football running back could not spell his name correctly and could barely print letters.  Spelling was nonexistent.  There was no way these papers could be graded and properly evaluated and feedback/correction returned to the “student” athlete—feedback and correction is a White thang anyway.The solution was to “pass” every paper with a large *P* and never assign written work.  At first I was shocked (as was wife), but in hindsight it was very, very sad to see such abuse of these athletes.  They never should have been admitted to college in the first place and their vaunted “educational opportunity” through their awarded scholarship was simply a sham that would not benefit them in society if they failed to make it in the “pros” (about 90%+).

                I work as a tutor with older school kids. It’s terrible. Even when they study classics, it’s only through a DIE lens. For example, the current text is Othello. They spend all their time writing about racism and sexism. None of the broader themes of the play or its true significance are even hinted at. And the rest of the curriculum is filled with modern woke garbage like the execrable Carol Ann Duffy’s “poetry”.

            Funny that this topic should arise. Just last night I was thinking about the challenging literature I read in junior high and high school. As early as the 7th grade (1979-80 for me), we were reading the likes of Fitzgerald, Poe, Shakespeare, Melville, Chaucer, Cather, Twain, Hemingway, Steinbeck and the like. I can only imagine what the 7th-grade kiddos in my old junior high are doing in English class today.

                As someone who has has firsthand knowledge of the situation, I must say that the issue is not just the crap material (which it is ); it is the laborious pacing and teaching. Every three sentences, “Best Practices” says that the student must stop and answer comprehension questions. Of course, the issue then becomes they never actually read. Who among us would actually read if we had to stop every thirty seconds and answer a question?

                    Night is a good read, but not a month, nor in place of the other authors mentioned above.  Forgetting about the nature of the author and the story setting, there are many reasons to read it wrt human tragedy and human weakness. Elie Wiesel and his relationship to his father and inability to keep him alive—even to the point of wishing him dead—and subsequent life long guilt is greatly moving and part of the human tragedy, which we can all relate to.

        All BMW SUVs are already built in Spartanburg County, South Carolina. Many of Michelin tires going on them are also made nearby.  Volvo says they are also building a plant in the area too (not sure if will be for cars or trucks).
Part of it is a relatively low cost, right-to-work state.  Probably just as important, South Carolina has 4 nuclear power stations – making electricity costs affordable and stable, unlike Germany.

        Where can we go for retirement? IIRC, Someone said there were two places left in the US that were massively majority white, sort of like the 1950s. But I can’t remember what they were, and I can’t locate the comment. Does anyone know? I need to do like Zman pretty soon. Any good candidate rural locations? Thanks in advance!

I have heard that a good retirement strategy is to go straight into the mouth of the cat and move to the far east,  Apparently there are still places where if you have $60,000 dollars US – you’re a millionaire. Money talks, and the local little clippers are well behaved, industrious and eager to please and serve.
But whadda I know?

            Don’t take this the wrong way, but unless you are a truly exceptional, perceptive person, you should probably not retire to a small rural community. Stick to somewhere similar in character to where you have lived your life, whether where you live now or in a state of your choice. It is extraordinarily difficult to fit into somewhere you have no roots, particularly as you get older. At least when you are younger, your kids will make friends with the locals, but without that in, you will probably always be an outsider.There are ways to do so as a retiree, usually though church, but, again, the very nature of trying to make a difference means you will be perceived as someone telling the hicks how things should be done. It looks as if you are some city slicker trying to take over. Pick a church that is heavily involved locally, rather than one sponsoring mission trips all over the world.Ideally, you should have brought your company to the hinterlands 20 years ago, been a local employer, sponsored the little league or been a scoutmaster (back when scouts was still a good thing to do).Good luck with whatever you decide.

                Even if you have old roots, like a hometown, a certain percentage just doesn’t fit in. A good hint is if you didn’t fit in with your peers during High School, it likely won’t be any different with time. Some of the jerks will mellow out, but the difference in personalities, temperaments, and interests remain the same.

                This is a really good point, for the average person it takes a long time to break into the community life of a small town.  Especially if you are not going to be working or operating a business, there are limited opportunities for you to get to know other community members.  People also need to have their eyes open as to how widespread the trashworld mindset has become.  As Zman alludes to in the podcast don’t expect these small towns to be Mayberry with updated tech stuff.

                    But a small town is not only a place to find community, it is also a place to be left alone. Depends upon what it is you seek.

                        Depends on what you mean. Everyone knows everyone else, and an effort to stay hidden will be noted. Soon the local gossip will be that you are a serial killer on the lam or an unregistered sex offender. Which is fine, until everyone starts treating you as if you are.
You can have your privacy, sure, but at the cost of exile and isolation.

                    This is true. I still recall the time my mom drove me out to a small town on the Chesapeake Bay northeast of Baltimore. It was supposedly “quaint”. She parked and we started to walk down Main street. Soon a pack of zombie teenagers materialized though and started following us about 100 yards back. Serious, they were thin, pale, and did not look like they were going to violin practice. It’s important to visit these places in rural America because a lot of them have a high, um… zombie quotient. This was way back in the 80s too. I can only imagine what that place is like now.

                A lot of the posts in this particular thread make it seem like the choice is a binary between fitting in with the Good Ol’ Boys and Church Ladies or being a totally isolated outcast and pariah with no friends. As a guy in his late fifties who grew up in these rural parts I can say that is not that simple.Even in a place with a low population density, you still get cliques and subcultures.When I went to HS out here I wasn’t hanging out with the Jocks, Preppies or Rednecks. I was hanging out with the kids into muscle cars, dirt bikes, Heavy Metal music, beer and loose women. We didn’t like the Jocks and Preppies and they didn’t like us.All these years later and (for those of us who haven’t moved away) things are still pretty similar. The Jocks, Preps and Rednecks all grew up and became the gossipy church ladies and GOP supporting griller Good Ol’ Boys.Meanwhile you’ve still go that underclass of bikers, gearheads, weird backwoods survivalist types, etc.Then there are other people around here that don’t fit in with either of the above groups. Like that chick who works in town at the Tractor Supply who will talk to anyone about all the Cryptids she sees living in the woods behind her house. I’d much rather be friends with her than with the prominent community member who drives his trad family to church every Sunday in his F350 and who thinks that Lindsey Graham would make a great president, supports Isreal and that black Republicans are based.I have a pretty big circle of great friends around here and literally not one of them would fit in with the old family, goes to the big church, normie grillers who dominate the social and cultural scene in most rural areas.

        My wife and chose to pack up and move to a semi-rural area of the South.
One difference between the South and New England is the distance between the classes.  New England and New Jersey has it’s rich towns and neighborhoods well separated from the working poor.  It’s become a running joke with us – drive past a beautiful luxurious house, and in less than a mile you will pass a shack or trailer.

            From what I’ve seen, many parts of the South are the last areas where there is actual integration of social classes. That’s not the case in urban areas there, either, but outside the cities you will see rich and poor in close proximity.
As for Z’s Austin exemplar, you know the Dirts he lived among in Appalachia were glad to see him leave, too. He’ll likely end up back in his place of origin when the Austin freaks disappoint him and fail to live up to his expectations.

            Maxda:  Yes.  But there is a distinct difference with the old, local monied class and the newcomers from the cities (almost uniformly ‘retirees’ – bah, humbug).  There are some seriously wealthy people here, who live modestly and whose wealth is in acreage, livestock, and family.  They could buy stocks and jewels and travel the world, but they put their money where their values are – in family and local community.The incoming retirees, on the other hand, build 5,000 sq. ft. mansions on 1-3 acres, preferably with a water view.  And they have brought with them mestizo contractors, and ethnic restaurants, and a golf-course ‘community.’  One of the first thing the over 50 asks about is “availability of healthcare,” followed closely by variety of ethnic food.  A plague on them all.We are not summer people and we are not retirees (despite our age).  And the cashiers at the local market recognize me now, and I’m a regular customer at the local feed store.

        The alienation of whites from themselves has to be one of the most beastly products of the modern age.  As someone who grew up in a mixed income small town, I am routinely dismayed at the corrosive effects of suburban life on its denizens, who simply cannot imagine life outside their income bracket.  On white females this has induced the cuckoo effect, in which the care and consideration they would have bestowed on the less fortunate in their own communities has been forcibly transferred to ‘the other’, while in white males this has transferred hero worship of their own ancestors and confederates to stranger worship, with predictable results.  Until whites learn to divest themselves of this alienation, they are doomed.

What terrifies me moast about the suburbs are the 95-lb AWFLs trying to hold back 120-lb pitbulls from attacking you.
Around here, you can’t walk on a sidewalk anymoar unless you’re c@rrying, and your c@liber is greater than or equal to .40 or 10mm, and, even then, I would want a very large m@g@zine to make sure that I could finish the job.

                    Hah, brought an incident to mind that happened today.  Took wife out for lunch and went to a thriving outdoor bar and restaurant owned by a Navy Seal, “Trident”.  The atmosphere is pure White testosterone on steroids.  Filled with rednecks, active duty LEO, military, and other personnel and retirees.Just as we parked, a crowd of firearms instructors were leaving.  Shirts, badges, vests, duty belts, multiple mag’s…armed like in a grade B movie.  Wife looks at me and says, what is this place?  I said, don’t worry the food is good and it’s safe.  😉That’s probably the only redeeming thing about this State, Constitutional carry, and a laid back, lack of concern for the sight of an armed person.

                One of the big reasons Whites fail to organize is because of their tendency to be warehoused in the suburbs.  Being spread out for many square miles around the city in “neighborhoods” where no one knows their next door neighbor renders them quite harmless and docile.

        As a man who grew up in a rural area in a lower class home then moving up in class and raising children in the suburbs i find as i get older a longing to go back to that small community i left behind years ago, it helps that my wife was also raised in that rural area.The good thing is that there is already a people and a community that we are familiar with, the bad thing is our children we raised have no affinity toward it.That small  home town community does not have cool restaurants and coffee bars it has farmers, ranchers and some white people living in trailers here and there.Its a foreign country to my kids.Which gets to the Z’s essay, the community we go to or we build from scratch has to be an organic community with both people who smell nice and we people whom don’t, but the white trailer park people are still our people.The suburbs and their coffee shops and easy access to the good things keep us in our own comfortable world.Not everyone was built to be a pioneer in our past and not everyone is built to be a pioneer in our present.I sometimes wish that i would have found a way to stay in that rural world and have raised my family there. I think its a better upbringing, but that is just me.

        Society can’t totally corrupt the individual. There’s too much fire, too much passion, being built in the individual’s chest to be swamped by the cold water of society. Even in Japan — the most conformist, ass-licking society in the world — the individual manages to eke out an existence. All hope is not lost for the individual.

        From you and Ed Dutton I’m getting these points:1.) Normie, by nature, can’t “wake up”2.) Elites, by nature, rule civilizations3.) The traits that distinguish normies and elites can’t be repressed by environment (or hopeful wishes)4.) Our outstanding civilizational achievements have come, and will always come, with dysfunctional trade-offs because such is the nature of the human condition
I don’t disagree, exactly, but then what is the point of engaging with politics at all? Why care about events whose outcomes are the predetermined outputs of a massive biological calculator?

            Frank, as you point out, if the future of humanity is determined by biology, what’s the point of talking about it?  The cosmic joke may be that we are determined to talk about outcomes that we can’t change.  What could be funnier than robots programmed to discuss their free will?  And that we’re determined to laugh at the joke?But just like some people are smarter or more creative than others, some people may have more free will and more ability to change how determined consequences are manifest in the world.  Some people may have the ability and opportunity to alter the course of the river of determined outcomes that flows from the past.Yeah, that’s a pretty meager foundation for hope, but we play the hand we are dealt.  Because we must.

                IMHO If you accept that life is purely material then you have to believe events are predetermined. That’s because the materials always interact with each other according to nature’s laws, whether it’s two atoms in lab or infinitely more making up the human brain. Just because we don’t have enough information to predict future events doesn’t mean their outcome isn’t certain. Think of when you let your little brother “play” video games with you by giving him a useless controller. To him, the events onscreen are so unpredictable he falsely believes he’s controlling them. But that doesn’t change the fact that he isn’t playing, or the fact that what he’s watching is determined by the game’s code.

                    You may well be right.  However, there may be cases where a person can understand a determined system and react to that understanding with some degree of free will.Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems and Turing’s Halting Problem may be the purest expression of what I’m talking about.  (Both of these are just formal expressions of the ancient Liar’s Paradox.)Gödel was able to understand the limitations of arithmetic reasoning.  While he couldn’t change these results, he could tell us to no longer pursue formalizing intelligence, like Whitehead and Russell attenoted in the Principia.Some humans may have some ability to react with some free will to a determined system.  We may be able to do something similar in politics.  Or not.

Precisely.  Knowledge is power.  I can’t fight off a cougar in the wild with my bear hands, but I can understand when he is stalking me (as in deciding upon his next meal) and when he is just curious as to a strange creature he’s never seen before.  From there I can choice how to react with a higher probability of a successful interaction with this creature than if I simply scream and run.

                        I don’t think that’s what he’s getting at. Rather that in a purely materialistic universe, there is no such thing as “randomness” even at the quantum level. “Randomness” means just that we don’t know the cause(s) or input(s) of something.It’s not that something physical called a “probability field” “collapses” when a particle’s spin is measured. The particle had that spin before we measured it. We just replaced a probabilistic value we didn’t know with an actual value we do.Upshot is that in a purely materialistic universe, everything is deterministic. Everything that ever happens in such a universe could be predicted knowing only the state of all matter and energy in the universe at any arbitrary point in time. There is no room for free will in such a universe.

            I occasionally see posts here and around the dissident-sphere about the hopelessness of reaching Normie. Well, I concur. The idea most people have of “revolutions” is a bunch of peasants with obsolete rifles charging some government building. I actually think a lot of early Soviet films might be to blame for this. They made some real propaganda masterpieces back then with very good cinematography and I think that footage was later adopted by Western documentaries whenever they needed a scene of a revolution.The Soviet movies were bullshit though. There will never be more than a minority of people fed up enough and educated politically enough to gel into a revolutionary elite. What typically happens is that this elite forms while the old regime is still in power but making mistakes. Life is getting worse for “Normie” but he doesn’t have an ideology to explain it. He doesn’t so much attack the regime as lose interest in supporting it. This is what allows the revolutionary elite to gain power.

        At whatever age I have attempted his writings — and I’m 60+ now — I have always found Emerson to be completely unreadable. It’s like wrestling with fog. Some time ago, it became clear to me that the newly independent United States felt an urgent need of what would now be called a public intellectual, and Emerson was one of several in New England who fit the profile — Channing was another.Thoreau is at his best in his travelogues: the Maine woods, Cape Cod, canoeing the Assabet, Concord, and Merrimack rivers. Walden is mostly annoying, especially when you find out that he walked home for meals.

            Yeah, I used to really admire people who made a name living outside of society either literally (think survivalists) or more abstractly (think James LaFond). The reality is that these people rely on the society they claim to hold in contempt. If there weren’t suckers growing grain and coining silver pennies at the mint, there would be nothing for the highway man to rob. Last I heard, James LaFond lives in a patron’s suburban back yard, camped in a tent. He calls it “the yurt of the Great Khan”.

            Unreadable could describe most writers’ attempts at creating a great American literature prior to Mark Twain. Try reading James Fenimore Cooper.The Last of the Mohicansis a great story, but a terrible novel. Herman Melville is probably the best of that early 19th-century lot.

When one snipes about Thoreau having dinner with his mother, it’s like criticizing the Pieta because Michelangelo picked his nose.
Admire the art as a distillation of the person’s finest thoughts and intentions.  No brilliant author or artist can live to the standards of his work.[and I find his travelogues a bit of a bore].

            Yep. I found Emerson to be what he looked like: a pompous ass. As for Thoreau, he was the one of the first of a very common modern type: a BOBO. He talked a lot about escaping the horrors of modern civilization but never went too far enough into the wilderness that he, as you mention, couldn’t pop back for a big meal with his liberal bum-chums.

        Homeboy sounds like he wants to recreate the weird Yankee communal movement of the 19th century that was intimately tied up with the Transcendentalists- one that led to little bible thumping New Englands full of sober, industrious abolitionist Protestants further and further West. The kind of people who did not like Appalachian Dirt People migrating west. None of these guys will have the stones to defend their fantasy “community”, though, because sterile suburban bugmen can’t fathom doing that. Invented communities of trad hipsters will cave when the Gaystapo comes to town.

        Based on Bennett’s link, his profile image, and some other in-joke looking references, I don’t think the phylactery he’s referring to is the Orthodox Jewish one. Fantasy author and co-creator of Dungeons &amp; Dragons used the same word to be the kept soul of an undead sorcerer, like the needle that Russian mythological character Koschei the Deathless kept his soul in, which meant that he couldn’t be killed except by the destruction of the needle. In Gygax’s incarnation, the destruction of the phylactery.

        I’m about 3/4 through the episode so please forgive me if I end up repeating a point that was made in the conclusion.
My initial reaction, as you pointed out the contradictions, is that this man wants Bethesda, before Betty Friedan ruined it.
Which is admirable. My neighborhood would be idyllic if not for the AWFLs.

            I have the feeling that if the target of the host’s critique had said he was organizing a local park cleanup deliberate organization for the weekends with beer and wings after, instead of an insular bedroom community, Zman would have a different take.

                Maybe, but one is making an existing community a better place, while the other is trying to create a new community while maintaining the insularity that they were fleeing from in the first place.
People have commented on the fact that someone being a Christian is all well and good, but that does not mean that children and nephews and the like will be acceptable members of the community. Bennett is going to learn this lesson. The harpies and wackos have to infect everything that is good.

                        Don’t need to be king.Oppose the harpies and wackos to the best of our ability. They self-identify pretty quickly. Then just keep inconveniencing them until they leave.If absolutely compelled to let trannies into the girl’s locker room in high school, close the school. Convert grocery stores into members only private clubs. Make on-street parking require a permit, and, gosh, darn, we are all out of permits. Sheriffs used to do it all the time in “may issue” states to keep guns out of the hands of trouble.That can be done in a smaller community, while it may not be possible in a larger city, and impossible in a nation.

                        Steve’s solution is unworkable because of the carrying burden of defense. It is disproportionately costly in time, money, inconvenience, stress, etc to “outharass” people who are deliberately infiltrating.  It can work against the isolated and unorganized, but that is not the Enemy.

        The pioneer spirit is lost. You don’t have to go far either. Old mill towns outside of cities but within metro areas are waiting for revitalization. They usually have infrastructure already built. What is lacking is the will and time. The will of the “leftover” population but also newcomers who would still pay a fortune to be around an already built trendy restaurant instead of fostering and developing new ones. If you can go to far, start with the frontier next door.

            Agreed but the problem with the last round of ‘gentrification’ was that it was basically a gathering of hipsters. Restaurants and entertainment only go so far.Cities got big and became homes for normal people because of industry. In the big picture, burbs, exurbs, and work-from-home track the decline of industry and the rise of finance— are transitional.The good news is, after the collapse, people will have to get back to work, whether on the farm or in the factory. Probably a smaller population, I’d add. Not sure how high-tech fits in, because I’m not sure how sustainable it is. Mostly built on speculation. Silicon Valley pump and dump.I think that’s an important point, because it seems like high-tech follows finance, like finance follows industry and industry follows agriculture. Freedom from work, pain, and death— the impossible utopia people seem intent on building.

                Tech devalues too quickly and needs a constant stream of cash.  Hence why what used to be free with the purchase of a computer in the beginning, is now a monthly fee.  All the tech layoffs of the last two years, they can’t compete with a 5% interest rate.  They’ve relied on ultra low interest rates for the past 20 years in my opinion.  Its the echo of the 90’s bubble, with low rates providing the hot air.

        America is steeped in Gnosticism and European occultism of various kind, has been since well before its official founding.Gnosticism’s cults and various schools (mind-mold academies) went strato in the centuries after Christ, with endless permutations and metastases, complex and tricksy narrative tracts, including Mary as a foundational, celestial deity.  All foul, all attractive, all lies, full of pretty words and images to capture the human mind.America is archetypally Gnostic.  Those cults no longer are underground, but serve as fundament and religious focus of the nation.  The spiritual air that Americans breathe.  D.C. is little more than a vast cult center, a coven, with objects of pagan worship all over the place, should one wish to look.

                Why r u so obsessed with the “Immaculate  Heart”? Why do the shamans teach that Mary can hasten the second coming by her intercession?
In fact, why couldn’t the god of bad patriarchs confer untaintedness—freedom from originated original sin—to Liz every other Israelite female born in her time? And to every Greek?! Is the plan of salvation not the god’s own but one dictated by an eternal law beyond the god’s control? Or does the god of Mishle 5 just like playing games with its lab bonobos?

                        Paintersforms —
That is correct.  It was correct 1500 years ago, and it is correct now.
Women want — demand — a FEMALE deity, and will rebel endlessly against the actual deity, who is masculine and a Father.  So ‘churches’ find endless ways of placating them with female deities and semi-deities.

                Agreed, that Mary is not worshipped but rather asked for intercession.
But may I ask you why you do that? What part of the Bible commands that? Where’s the verse that says, “Seek the Lord your God with all your heart and mind and soul… oh, screw that. From here on out, just memorize what the small hats, um, I mean big hats say, and you are good to go. I’ve been meaning to replace that narrow door with high speed rail for some time.”

                Micoyote —I said nothing about ‘worship’ in my comments.  I said Catholics consider her a ‘deity’, which assuredly they do, naming her publicly the Queen of Heaven and the co-Mediatrix of redemption, along with Christ.  Catholics say they ‘revere’ and are ‘devoted’ to her.Please restrict your criticisms to comments I actually have made, instead of a comment you wish me to have made.I was raised Catholic and have much love for Catholic people.  They are not excluded from heaven, but they are idolatrous in their relationship to Mary, who was only a human being in this world.  Not the Queen of Heaven or of anything else.Your oversensitivity to this issue betrays the depth of your, ah, devotion to this person.  Also the fact that I have never seen you comment here before . . . but suddenly you appear to defend furiously the ‘Queen of Heaven’.  Hm.If I left you in error, I would be held responsible for not correcting you.  Now that I have, the responsibility is yours.

            America is the most practical of the great nations, owing to its youth. This GAE is Old World business grafted onto it for the time being, for the sake of empire. Left alone, America would’ve developed its own tradition. The transcendentalists were a first step in that direction, not the destination.

            The imprecations of Mariolatry aside, the point about Gnosticism is well taken. Our ruling class especially appears to function as an interrelated series of cults, more a Venn diagram than nesting dolls, each dependent on some exclusive information that they jealously guard from the uninitiated.
I am thinking more of the intelligence services here, but that does not necessarily rule out the more esoteric varieties, with their pizza parties and such.
In an environment where it is impossible to know the truth, anything is possible. Tailor made for cults.
