        The nice folks in “Fiddler on the Roof” didn’t do so well when their traditions were forced out from under them.“What could go wrong?”

        Yep, people judge others. That’s just the way it is. If you don’t want to be treated like you’re a thug, don’t act like one.

        If you don’t want to be treated like you’re from the ghetto, don’t behave like you live there. True for whites as for blacks. Behavior matters. Sorry, Liberals. And the crime stats don’t lie. Anyone can go to the FBIs site and look at the numbers themselves. Blacks are roughly 13% of the population, yet commit 28% of total crime, and nearly 50% of murders. It’s hard for a community to self-police when three quarters of the black population don’t have a father in the home. Behavior has consequences.

        My OCD won’t let me leave it alone… But the word you wanted is “insight”, not “incite”. You *incite* a riot, but have *insight* into a problem.

Ha! That was deliberate. The whole point of Baba Bouie’s shtick is to incite. Frankly, I did not think anyone would notice. I guess I have smart readers.

        People get bullied into accepting bullies. If black people want all ‘their kind’ to stay loyal to the tribal identity then bullying them (or pressuring them) is the way to go.The resulting language of the tribe — bodily, verbally and intellectually — becomes the norm set by the bullies. Of course, lots of uneducated white people copy these things as they imagine it is ‘real’ and ‘streetwise.’ Then the white youth do strange things like wanting to hold guns the way they see black criminals hold guns in movies, and use their phrases and gestures as if it was their language.The bullies thus get to see their bullying reinforced by a broader acceptance. If the elite who run white society start yelling, ‘Hey, my man!’ in public the bullying lower down the ladder has succeeded.
