        If she can do to any cabinet department what she did to Lucent and HP, I will vote Republican and hope she heads every department but defense.

            I’m pretty sure she is why “failing up” became a common term in DC. Except that it is something people aspire to in DC. No kidding. It’s sort of an inside gag.

        ‘Failing Up’ is an interesting slant on what we used to call here ‘being promoted out of the way.’ The idea was that the higher the idiot went in a business the less they were in a place where they could do real damage. Sure, they’d attend meetings and send memos and sit behind desk shuffling papers but they had no idea of what was going on so their contribution was all pretty harmless.One thing to note though: they never were promoted to the very top. If there was any  danger of that, they would be moved sideways into an even more meaningless job.

            The Japanese used to call it “getting a window seat.” The incompetent would be placed at desk to look out the window, maybe doing busy work.

        HP used to make the absolute best and easiest to operate chromatographs, liquid or gas. Their GC/MS was mighty fine, too. I don’t reckon I’ll try to explain what those are other than to say they are pieces of expensive analytical equipment.
That’s one of the sub-divisions they got rid of to concentrate on crappy printers and scanners. I think Perkin-Elmer bought that portion out. Never one of my favorite equipment manufacturers.

        I’ve been thinking of Alcibiades a lot, these past few years.
I was wondering how Fiorina is going to outrun her past. I don’t even see her as a viable VP. Since a successful Republican candidate is going to be under much more pressure to have a cabinet that “looks like America” than a Democrat, cabinet is not unlikely.

        HHS? How to you ruin a ruin? But there’s a thought. Send her to  EPA. Anything she can do to ruin that agency is much appreciated.

        Ellen Pao is noheroine.  But if I ever became a regular NYT reader, I might turn to the pain-abating solace ofheroin.
Thanks for the reminder about Fiorina’s business track record.

            My spell check kept changing it from heroine to heroin so I figured screw it let’s see if anyone notices. I figured it was a sign or something. Of course, I should probably fix it now. Maybe tomorrow, after I ride the horse.
