        Listener (radio) and viewer (TV) survey’s of the Nixon -Kennedy debate found that radio listeners thought Nixon had “won” the debate; viewers surveyed believed Kennedy won the debate.Turns out the Nixon’s sweating and visible demeanor detracted from any favorable impressions based solely on his speaking points.The present day “debate” format favors those who are quick on their feet; after all, a response must be presented within a few seconds after the question is posed. This literally prevents a reasoned, thoughtful analysis of what is being asked and how best to respond to the topic in the REAL world. After all, a ” quick” decision as president would allow 5 to 10 minutes to consider the options.As a result, Ben Carson – probably the smartest guy up there, the most thoughtful and the only person who has had to repeatedly make life and death decisions – is at a great disadvantage. Yet, IMHO, he would make a great president.Very good public speakers (e.g., Rubio) are benefited by the debate formats as well as perceived by the viewers/listeners as competent and smart. Then again, so was Obama (an individual who never in his ENTIRE ADULT LIFE held a real job before becoming president) . Recall that some world class public speakers were/are Hitler, Lenin, Mussolini and Castro. There simply is zero correlation between an individuals public speaking skills and competency to hold public office.Abe Lincoln would fare horrible in today’s TV driven political scene. He was literally an ugly guy; tall, ungainly. His physical presence would overpower his intellect and the power of his words.

            So true. Calvin Coolidge was imo, one of our finest presidents and remains highly underrated. Yet he sounded like a technocrat/bureaucrat when he gave a speech. Google his speech on taxation. I doubt someone like him could ever be elected in our modern age. Our celebrity-driven ADHD culture mixed with the Cult of Personality almost guarantees that the person deemed most electable  has been prepping for this for most of their life.

        Rambling response alert! Has Rubio ever had a job? He strikes me as a bit dim. Also I’ve often heard that story about 1960- but is there data? I’d guess Rand Paul is pretty smart- an open borders maniac, but smart. And Z your comment reminds me of the Derb’s proposal? observation? that no one more than 2 standard deviations from the mean IQ should be allowed to vote. I have a high school friend- very smart PHD in science, the whole deal. He has 5 kids- all good kids – not one works in the private sector- they all work for NGOs and non profits. Maybe this is just a function of latte towns, but it seems to me a huge portion of our cognitive elite are opting out of the private sector. As a wise man once said, “This will not end well!”

            Whywouldthey go private sector?  That’s one of the reasons our economy is so screwed — unless your intelligence and inclinations skew into very specific fields (computers, basically), there’s no place to exercise your talents in the private sector anymore.  Taxes and regulations crush innovation, and big companies have successfully offloaded all their R&amp;D onto universities.  If you’re bright, but writing code doesn’t turn your crank, you can either fight the leviathan regulatory state… or join it.  Job satisfaction is less, but the pay and bennies are great.

                All true, Severian, but a little foresight will deliver the news that a government  guarantee of security is worth no more than it’s grasp on reality. As Russians once said of  Soviet government, we pretend to work and they pretend to pay us.

                    I know that, and you know that, but … did you know it when you were fresh out of college?  I didn’t.  I had to get mugged by reality a few times.  If there’s any hope of turning the culture around, it’s got to start at the bottom — the first candidate who proposes demolishing the university system in toto is the first truly serious one.

                            I have friends and family in the ed biz, at from K-thru-PhD.  In a way, that’s exactly what I’m talking about — they’re bright, personable, good with people… all the skills that used to be the hallmark of entrepreneurs.  But with the market as distorted as it is, they wouldn’t dream of trying to start a business for themselves.  So what’s left?  They can either be cube rats, or get government jobs.  Having been a cube rat, I can tell you that a government job — at least one that puts you in front of a classroom — is much, much better.  At least that way you can exercise at leastsomeof your talents, and do some good for someone other than the faceless CEO and the equally faceless shareholders.

        It is a curious thing to see Well’s insight so completely fail to grasp the fundamental role which his own political philosophy had in bringing about that sunset, which places him in the company of the contemporary Prog class, absent the inconvenience of insight.

            He’s a good example of something I find endlessly interesting. People can have great intelligence or keen insights into the human animal, but also believe totally insane things that are obviously nonsense. Look at the number of physicists who were communist sympathizers. I like to use Chomsky as an example. Brilliant in a very hard field, but also a raving loon.

                Remember, too, that George Orwell was a socialist.  And not just a namby-pamby, love-the-world one, either — he really thought that you could do that “workers control the means of production” stuff without it degenerating into Stalinism.

                    When I was a kid, I played chess against a guy who was literally a rocket scientist for NASA. I would beat him at chess by mentioning how much I liked Nixon or something I heard about Alger Hiss. The guy would become so unhinged, he was easy pickings. It was awful of me, but a fun experiment.

It’s because they know how smart they are, thus they are elevated above all the pettiness, as are all their compatriots.  The flaws that are in every other man clearly are not in them, so they should be in charge of making everyone else’s decision.
It boils down to a lack of humility and a lack of fellowship and kinship with your fellow man.
