        Richard Dawkins also came out and said that you cannot have a Christian civilization without Christianity, which is so blindingly obvious that it takes a fedora-tipping atheist to not see it. I give credit to Dawkins for being intellectually honest enough to state that publicly, and he is intelligent enough to know that this means he was free-riding on Christianity his entire life, while attacking and undermining it. I sometimes wonder if we will see him getting baptized at some point before he meets his end.Sometimes I go on the atheist and ‚ÄúI f*cking love science‚Äù (aka, cringe atheism) reddit boards and it turns out they‚Ä¶ support everything the Democratic Party and the self-appointed media experts tell them to believe! Not one original thought in their heads. I look at that and start to see why atheism was pushed so hard in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

                Moran: for any totalitarian regime a monotheistic religion is a rival, as they are always idolatry that can‚Äôt exist without their idol: Lenin, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, Chavez and such.Today‚Äôs idolatry of one world government so far has no successful idol, which gives me hope.

                It was a symbiotic relationship, I believe. Monarchs ruled by divine right. God put them there, or so they liked to tell people. The church also had a seat at the head of power.
As much as I despise the commies, they did a lot of things right and you can‚Äôt blame them in a sense for being atheist when the religion you‚Äôre forbidding was part of the former government you just toppled.

                        I can understand why people down voted your comment.  Nevertheless, I agree with your comment.  It is not evil or wrong to notice the winning tactics of your enemies.If a bunch of atheistic commies overthrow your religious rule, the first thing you would do is destroy their institutions.  If we got power right now, we would be destroying globohomo‚Äôs institutions.  The ones we didn‚Äôt destroy, we would load up with ‚Äòour guys‚Äô and wear it like a skinsuit.  We‚Äôd be running the ministry of Diversity, Inclusion and Equity as a hierarchy.  We would redefine their definition of equality with our definition. Men and women are equal, but not the same.  The races are ‚Äúequal‚Äù but not the same.They‚Äôre like ideological libertarians.  ‚ÄúWe have to win with our morality!  We can‚Äôt do what our enemies do, lest we be just like them!‚Äù  The fact that they tried to destroy our beloved institutions is just so offensive they cannot see that it was a winning tactic, at least in the short term.

                            Thank you. The other things that the commies did right was healthcare and education. Oh sure, their healthcare might not have been up to our standards, but compared to what they had before, it was much, much better. The monarchy simply didn‚Äôt care about the peasantry. You were cattle to them.Likewise, with education. As my staunchly Reagan/Goldwater Republican father always says, a kid from a village like him would never have had the chance to go to college if it wasn‚Äôt for the communists. Again, the people who came before them (the Western installed monarchs) simply didn‚Äôt care.And STEM? The Russians don‚Äôt have to import people who are good at math, engineering and the sciences. They were disciplined enough to teach their kids to be world class. (Weren‚Äôt they the ones who pioneered laser eye surgery?)It‚Äôs time to get out of this cold war mindset and talk about how things really are (and were).They‚Äôre not good at sales, marketing and taking technology and bringing it to market, that‚Äôs for sure. But they‚Äôre not third world grass skirt wearing people, either.

                                Yep. Commie healthcare was great. Just so long as they weren‚Äôt starving you to death, working you to death in an ice-cold labor camp, or putting you up against a wall and shooting you.
Yep. They cared about the peasants alright. With that sort of care, I‚Äôd just as soon be ignored.

                                    What kind of healthcare did people get in their villages while their Western-installed monarch was galavanting around Europe rubbing elbows with his other Western installed cousins running all the other European countries? Animals got better health care.You see, the same people you guys hate in our country, that‚Äôs the people who were toppled by the communists. I‚Äôm not saying they were great, but compared to what they replaced, there were lots of pluses that they don‚Äôt teach you about.Think about it this way. Do you know who the carpetbaggers were? 99% Jewish. They don‚Äôt teach you that either. Do you really think you got an honest assessment of the pros and cons of monarchy and the communism that replaced it?

They just aren‚Äôt as quick to force you to pop pills, for example, instead being ahead of the curve on phages, while we dispense prescriptions for antibiotics like toilet paper. In fact, my nephew, who‚Äôs an undergrad, but probably geared towards going to medical school, was pretty impressed with my knowledge of phages. Not an in-depth knowledge, mind you, but that I even knew what they were and that they existed. ü§£Lots of people here go back to the old country for dental work. They do excellent work over there.

                                Dude I just downvoted you because you have said previously that you love downvotes. Just trying to help you get it up ‚Äì the downvote count, I mean.Plus your overall comment is kind of stupid. Have you ever bothered to check out how many of these ‚Äúhealthy, educated‚Äù young men of the USSR were cut down like flies by their own government? Or sent to Siberian labor camps after coming home ‚Äì victorious ‚Äì from Germany?It‚Äôs time to get out of this cold war mindset and talk about how things really are (and were).Ok, let‚Äôs have that conversation. How things are? Been to Russia lately? Me neither. So nix that. How things were? Read Bukovsky ‚Äì an expert in the Soviet ‚Äúmental health system‚Äù. Read Solzhenitsyn ‚Äì an expert in Soviet ‚Äúcancer wards‚Äù.As it happens I like Russia; it has always fascinated me and its contributions to all ‚Äúwestern‚Äù branches of culture ‚Äì in science, the fine arts, music, and literature ‚Äì are stupendous. But you are arguing that Soviet Russia is getting disrespected‚Ä¶ yeah, well, the way Dutch elm beetles are, killing elm trees‚Ä¶ just for your edification I recommend (at random) not labor camp memoirs per se (too obvious), butThe Whisperers(author?), Bukovsky‚ÄôsTo Build a Castle,Journey into the Whirlwind,Everyday Stalinism(sorry the author‚Äôs names are eluding me here in my elderly drunkenness).Life in the USSR was extraordinarily unpleasant. To argue that they had good STEM programs and developed new technologies is true and inarguable. Human life, however, the happiness thereof anyway, isn‚Äôt measured by breakthroughs in science but by, I don‚Äôt know, having enough to eat, having an apartment of your own, raising your own family, not living in fear, for starters.Fun fact: The Aral Sea, shown on my 1985 Rand-McNally globe, is gone. Dried up. The VCBs under Khruschev and Brezhnev decided to divert the river feeding the Aral into Kazakhstan cotton production. Result? An entire salt sea, gone. Gosh, those Soviets sure had an eye to the future didn‚Äôt they? Haven‚Äôt checked the cotton production of Kazakhstan lately, though; maybe I am being too judgemental?

                                    One could argue that the former Soviet Union wasn‚Äôt really Communist. It certainly was totalitarian, but it didn‚Äôt strike me as globalist in its aspirations. After Lenin died, the USSR broke into socialist and Communist factions, the latter under the leadership of one Lev Aronovich Bronstein, a/k/a Leon Trotsky. Trotsky and his fellow (mostly) Jewish utopians no doubt cackled about that Georgian thug Djugashvili, only to find that Stalin had displaced them, sending Trotsky to Mexico (after all that good work he‚Äôd done putting down that Kronstadt revolt!). Stalin was about ‚Äúsocialism in one country‚Äù though he could for a time charm Malcolm Muggeridge and other foreign visitors by posing as the great international socialist. But when the Germans launched Operation Barbarossa, Stalin pulled out every possible nationalist trick that he could, invoking the name and spirit of Alexander Nevsky, re-establishing ranks, recreating Czarist-era Guards divisions and regiments‚Äìhell, the Soviets referred to their chapter of WWII as The Great PATRIOTIC War. Long story short, the Soviet regimes were able to defeat the Wehrmacht, launch a satellite, an astronaut, even a dog into orbit, and produce certain breakthroughs in technology (though not so much things such as tank engines and consumer goods. A society with a cadre of highly-intelligent people was able to do great things, albeit at an enormous human and financial cost.

                    The Process is the Evil of Communism.  Once you rely on murder to win an argument, you‚Äôve delegitimized yourself, which incidentally shows why Islam is essentially demonic, but I digress.The problem with Marxism in general is that it relies on destruction to ‚Äúbuild‚Äù the future and what we discovered in the 20th century was that its promises could not make up for what it destroyed, not even a 10th of what it destroyed.  And really one could argue that we are living out the denouement of 1789 and 1917 and that we will not rise again until we hit rock bottom and the heresy of Man First is discarded and The Church is recentered at the heart of our Civilization.It seems as if the powers that be know this, which is why they invest so much time and energy keeping the various denominations as pozzed and weak as possible, by controlling schools of divinity and intervening directly where possible to make sure their globohomo Priests and Bishops are appointed and not proper Christians.If you want to see how this ideological butchery takes place in real time I invite you to look at the story of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, the Archbishop Elpidophoros of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, and the Divinity School at Fordham University.  It seems that for the sake of undermining Russia and disuniting the orthodox world, the CIA and its willing collaborators are perverting Orthodox Theology to be more inline with Vatican2 lavender mafia developments. Bartholomew being in Turkey and hence vulnerable to an instant Grey Wolves Turkish Para militia assault on himself or the remaining faithful acts as an ideal pressure point for our scummy Agencies to use as a last resort. It is curious that the harassment The Church faced in Turkey ended as soon as Bartholomew started advocating autocephaly for the Ukrainian Church and tolerating queer and woman participation in the American Greek Orthodox Church.The point is simple.  I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre an atheist or not.  What I want you to acknowledge is that first a people require God to survive and that second our enemies constantly attack The Church because they know it can give us the strength to oppose and overturn them.

            always love reading the comments.  i believe the atheist, agnostic thoughts are for times of peace and plenty, when a majority of the population has agreed to follow a moral code.  my wife is a believer of convenience.  when times are good she questions if god exists, but when shtf, she is the first one on her knees pleading.  i think many men/women believe this way.  it is not abnormal.  as civil men we have given up the natural man (no moral code) to follow a greater creed for the benefit to all.  we are still men who revert to our natural state and make corrections along the way.  consistently recognizing the roots of the moral code is essential to maintain civility.as government is concerned.  keep church/state separate, maintain the christian based moral code for civility.  any deterrence from the moral code by government is treasonous and lacks authority in a civil society.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buqtdpuZxvk

        Considering what they accomplished without our technology, people in antiquity, the middle ages or the Renaissance, were not dumber than today. Probably the opposite but never mind that.There is not a single surviving civilization or even a small sheltered jungle tribe, that was atheist.During world war two they did operations research on where returning bombers were hit. They reenforced the parts they never saw hit. Because the sample was bombers that managed to crawl back home.Applying operations research to spiritual traditions, a rational man will conclude that if you want your society to survive, you do not remove religion. Atheists are not rational; they are conceited cultists who have turned the empty set into an idol

            about the WW2 bombers ‚Äì granted, they assumed that the parts they saw hit (on the planes that returned) survived and were not the most vulnerable parts, but did they analyze the planes that went down after being hit for obvious vulnerabilities?

                They did not have easy access to planes lost over enemy controlled territory but I am quite sure they did proper analysis of the information they had access to. The point of this famous (and afaik true) story is the information logically present via sample absence. The same applies to atheist, pacifist, feminist, equality of kin and stranger and several other ideas, civilizations

                Atheism in practice seems to require ‚Äúfaith‚Äù in the infinite perfectibility of man.  That takes a lot of belief, which few religions seem to subscribe to.  But I‚Äôm not learned in comparative religions however.

                I like that Ostei. Both faith and belief push the boundaries of what is knowable. Faith goes further because it has to push harder. Some people just can‚Äôt stand to live in doubt, so they take a few extra steps.

                This is correct. A proper Christian is agnostic; belief replaces certainty. An atheist cannot doubt; he ‚Äúknows‚Äù that the universe has no Creator, it just ‚Äúis‚Äù. However, as Z incisively observes, the atheist is unable to explain the foundation of this certainty except by denigrating traditional (primarily Christian) belief. These assaults on Christianity may well be useful tools in smashing Christianity itself ‚Äì if that is in fact the underlying goal ‚Äì but they in no way establish the truth of atheism.As is said of vegans, so with atheists:Q: How do you know someone is an atheist?A: Give them ten minutes; they‚Äôll tell you.

                100%. The most fervent religious people I have encountered have been atheists by a large margin. They are right up there with fundamentalist Christians and radical Muslims.For a fun game, attempt to tell them that they areexactlylike the people they choose to deride and make fun of. Watch the reaction for the lulz and prepare for drama. To say with100% certaintythat you wholly understand existence and the universe is the same level of comical arrogance you see from the most devoutly faithful of any religion. Atheists skew slightly above average on IQ so this is fairly typical for the high-tier midwit. Once you reach the far right on the bell curve the view starts to look more and more like the left side of it but with a bit more nuance.‚ÄúThere is far more to this life and existence than we understand but I cannot being to understand the mind and rationale of God (the Creator, the Unmoved Mover, whatever), nor would I attempt to.‚ÄùFascinatingly, many scientists in both the complex biological disciplines as well as the ‚Äòuniverse studiers‚Äô tend to fall into this camp. Once you truly understand the comically absurd complexity of biological processes and the universe itself in a deeply scientific way it becomes quite clear to most.

            ‚Äú‚Ä¶people in antiquity, the middle ages or the Renaissance, were not dumber than today.‚ÄùWoodley a few years ago presented a paper is which he obtained a couple of dozen or so genomes for Greek people.  He analyzed/measured a couple thousand or so genes noted for IQ effect, then ranked the findings by period‚Äîancient, classical, modern.  Highest ratings for IQ found in classical Greeks of Plato‚Äôs era.  Oddly, I believe it was Galton who way back when also speculated that the classical Greeks were smarter than the people of the modern era.  I also seem to remember recently reading a similar study to Woodley‚Äôs on the ancient Romans.  Again, around the time of early empire, high IQ marks, which then begin to decline in time proximity to empire decline.

        I used to be an atheist for many years before finally becoming a Christian. I took a passing interest in the new atheists but after a while I just didn‚Äôt care anymore. I didn‚Äôt believe in God any more than I believed in pink elephants living on the far side of the moon. If they wanted me to believe they would have to convince me. I‚Äôm not obligated to consider every assertion someone makes at me.What finally convinced me was the morality issue. I had my own code I thought I lived by, but in the end I couldn‚Äôt live up even to my own relatively low standards, let alone God‚Äôs perfect standards. Which makes the notion of sin start to make sense. Eventually this led me to understand what Jesus did on the cross for us and why we need Him.

                    Let me help you out.
There is *one* main problem with Libertarianism. It assumes an environment (in which men dwell) not in evidence. Call it an ideal environment. Perhaps one of lack of government, but rather free association among men. The physics lecturer‚Äôs ‚Äúfrictionless plane‚Äù. If this environment were in effect, most problems with Lib would go away.
So really, the ‚Äúlong list‚Äù excuse you use to avoid defense of your quip, is not really that long‚Äîif you really understand Libertarianism well enough to criticize it.

            ‚ÄúAtheism in the West is for people who think Christianity cramps their style. They don‚Äôt like rules, usually sex and ‚Äúsexuality‚Äù based rules.‚ÄùThis is true but also in the opposite direction as well with the feminization &amp; in a similar vein jewish influence on the faith making it extremely irritating to masculine men. There‚Äôd be millions more Christians today if it was more like the medieval era where masculinity &amp; warrior culture was lionized instead of demonized &amp; not just for  the sake pointless foreign wars.I know countless men who absolutely despise Christianity because of its association with bleeding heart soccer moms &amp; soft weak men with an equal number whose view of the religion is permanently welded to neocons. Unfortunately in my experience those two camps cover an obscene amount of Christian demographics so you have this weird phenomenon where there‚Äôs tons of people who would otherwise be self described Rightists sympathetic to the faith but are instead reflexively hostile to the Right &amp; the religion due to unpleasant experiences with those demographics.This also explains many of the non political normies that aren‚Äôt dysgenic who hate leftism but call themselves centrists because from their view both sides are trash. I have a lot of firsthand experience with those smug feminized Christians who are aligned with the cucked mainstream GOP so I understand the position even if I don‚Äôt agree with throwing the baby out with the bathwater approach they take.Semi related but I attribute Trump‚Äôs initial popularity with reaching those people by being the polar opposite of those types, too bad that didn‚Äôt play out like we all hoped it would. Still what he did is a reminder that if you get a good masculine leader you can cut through that bullshit but the eternal anglos &amp; jews know that better than anyone else unfortunately.

                The problem is that this is a self-fulfilling problem.  If real men walk away from Christianity because of their disgust at effeminate men and their C*nts, well, Christianity will become ever more aligned with the wishes of these effeminate men and their c*nts.Right now, Christianity is SJW converged, at least in the West.  Anyone denying this is kidding themselves.  BUT, Christianity is not inherently this way.  Any institution led by men will reflect the men leading it.  Today the institutions are led by sissies, frauds, chomos and women. But if they were run by real men, the institutions would be solid and healthy.  They wouldn‚Äôt jump on every fad.  Think about that.  The Church is supposed to be a rock. It‚Äôs supposed to say the same and not jump on the cultural bandwagons.  Women ‚Äúpriests‚Äù who profess to be lesbians performing ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù ceremonies of trannies.  Cross comes down, rainbow flag goes up.Just look at Joel Olsteen.  What a fag. What a sissy.  The ‚Äúman‚Äù will not condemn anything.  This guy has many millions of followers who hang on every word he says.  Even the ones that aren‚Äôt sissies are grifters and con men.  No man would put up with this BS.But I do have hope and optimism around the reformation of The Church.  She‚Äôs been around for 20 centuries.  It is the oldest continual institution in the world. She‚Äôs being led by sissies, homos, chomos and other undesirables, but they will be cast aside eventually.  The Russian Orthodox Church was all but destroyed. What little of it that remained was infested with atheists and commies. But today it is regaining its strength.  Even the Church of England will be reformed.  Women, homos and sissies will be cast to the curb.Even if I am wrong and the churches are all just converged beyond reformation, they will never wear their Christian skinsuit for long.  They will be doomed to the ash bin of history.

                    Very well said &amp; your point about being these cucked churches doomed is so spot on, outside of new England &amp; similar utterly leftist places I don‚Äôt know how in the hell any of these churches will last.I know a lot of people like a top down style organization but that‚Äôs precisely has killed so many churches by creating a single point of authority to subvert. Some overarching church org in my state put out a mandate that every church under their umbrella had to essentially shill leftism &amp; be openly anti Trump. That ended exactly how you would expect it to &amp; there‚Äôs no chance in hell they didn‚Äôt know this would be the result. Makes me wonder if some org like blackrock is paying off the top brass to essentially suicide entire chains of churches, it‚Äôs not that far fetched.You really hit the nail on the head about whose leading these churches, that applies to basically every institution. Healthy people have a natural revulsion to the types who are in positions of power throughout the West so it is as you said about it being a self fulfilling problem. It‚Äôs not sustainable, virtually nothing about our society is &amp; I suspect people will either go underground or do like Cubans did &amp; leave with their traditions in tact, which one will be dependant on how the decline of the West plays out.Germans have been colonizing Paraguay due to the insane leftist government &amp; islam for example. Obviously I hope it doesn‚Äôt come to that across the board but that is always an option, a traditional third world is better than a third world with a rainbow mafia breathing down your neck. If we‚Äôre gonna live in a primitive country regardless then I which one I would prefer to reside in.

                    ‚Äúbeing led by sissies, homos, chomos and other undesirables, but they will be cast aside eventually.‚ÄùThe Church is as it always was. It‚Äôs no more falling apart than she was at the beginning. She has had a lot of bad press though for a long time in the West.Personally, I think this is might a social breeze that is going to destroy most of the large group movements of the last 500 years in Christianity outside the Church. The odd ball groups never seem to go away entirely. But it is odd that Protestantism in particular grew without much of check. Other ancient groups were fought and eventually died away. It appears rainbow flags are doing some pruning.

        The religion of athiesm has always held a strong attraction for ‚Äòspergy scientism types.  Since hatred of Christianity has long been one of the core bigotries of the current ruling class, any dorky STEM nerd can attract some attention to himself and get patted on the back for being a good boy by loudly trashing Christianity.  Harris and Dawkins are typical in that they could possibly be well-regarded by the collegues in their fields were they to limit their energies to their areas of expertise, but that attention is not enough to satisfy their egos so they spend most of their time sticking their tongues out at religion.What‚Äôs a bit frightening is that in the minds of people like Harris, thereisan objective morality.  What theypersonallybelieve is moral and immoral does indeed constitute the objective truth, because they are smarter and better than everyone else.  There‚Äôs no comfort in realizing that our rulers share this opinion because burning times are near and someone will start implementing their personal morality by force.  At least if history‚Äôs any indication though, useful clowns like Harris and Dawkins will quickly find themselves afoul of some esoteric bit of regime morality and end up with the rest of us in the camps where demonstrations that their beliefs are mistaken can be given in more intimate settings.

            Reminds me of libertarians. I think there‚Äôs actually a large overlap in atheism and libertarianism. Both of them thrive on holier-than-thou debating (ironically), both provide some large cohort of supposed goobers they can pick on (Christians and ‚Äústatists‚Äù) to feel superior to, and most importantly, both put the spergy guy (and yea they‚Äôre all men) at the center of their own universe.

                There is a little more to it than that. In any case, if you look at the scorecard, atheists have killed a lot more believers worldwide than vice versa. Non-believers too; atheists aren‚Äôt picky when they gain power.

                        The point, and you understand it of course, is that certain famous atheists, largely the demon spawn of western post-enlightenment rationalism, kill people by the millions when they have the power to do so.God‚Äôs existence is an entirely separate question, which you also know.For the sake of avoiding argument, ‚ÄúGod‚Äù is undefined, and his existence can neither be proven nor disproven. In fact the adjective ‚Äúhis‚Äù has no meaning, really. Unless you buy into a religion that begins with ‚ÄúGod the Father‚Äù, wherein ‚Äúhis‚Äù is used for the sake of grammar, if nothing else.I can prove that there exists an infinite number of prime numbers but I can‚Äôt prove the existence of an infinite (or even finite) number of ‚Äúawesome‚Äù numbers, the kind of numbers that would have drawn Ramanujan‚Äôs attention‚Ä¶ likewise neither you nor I can prove or disprove the existence of ‚ÄúGod‚Äù. I get that and actually kind of enjoy it. Ergo ‚Äì we are EQUALLY ignorant on the topic. Atheists have a hard time with that, lacking humility.

So is America, despite all the Jesus-talk.
What we DO have in Scandinavia, is 20-25% of the population voting for what they believe are white nationalist parties.
How many white nationalists are there in Congress?

You mean to thepagancivilizations of the Med?
You read history like a certain person reads the Bible. Back when we were pagans, we ruled from Kiev to Dublin and from Greenland to the Rhine.
And as with the Roman Empire, it all started going downhill fast once we succumbed to Christianity.

Back when we were pagans, we ruled from Kiev to Dublin and from Greenland to the Rhine.‚ÄùNot all pagan civilization were the same. Northern Europeans have come to think of themselves as on top the world since ancient times. However, their ability to civilize outwards has been a very recent development, post 1600AD or so. A history of the West before Christ is a history of the Mediterranean¬†sea. It is that way for a long time after Christianity too. I‚Äôm all for honest history. But it it has to be honest. I‚Äôm largely of English descent as an American, so I‚Äôm talking here about me too. We were a lot vaguely uncivilized sheep herders mostly while the Romans were building the Parthenon.‚ÄúAnd as with the Roman Empire, it all started going downhill fast once we succumbed to Christianity.‚ÄùAll for honesty here again. By timelines, the Roman Empire was already in decay by the 1st century. The republic was already dead, with most of her conquests behind her. That we know so much about Roman and Greek culture is about the Christianity that was not afraid to preserve the best of paganism as it descended into the sort of society we see around us.

Yes, but they weren‚Äôt Christians, were they? Your argument was that Scandinavia only thrived after being Christianized, so where does that leave Athens or Rome?
This whole discussion is an offshoot of the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt fear being tortured for a trillion years, how can you be a good person‚Äù-argument. The fairly modern ascendancy of Europe has nothing to do with the Bible and everything to do with Europeans.

                A religion is a set of beliefs about the supernatural and the human culture that springs from it. Atheism truly is a religion by the broadest definition of it. It has a set of beliefs about the supernatural, which it uses to accept or reject propositions and create a distinct culture. In the West there is a Christian influence to that culture. It largely borrows it‚Äôs morality and arguments from it.Religion as ‚Äúbad and irrational‚Äù is incoming from the general modern culture. To have a religion is to be human. There is no other creature on earth, as far as we know, that even thinks about a Creator, the supernatural/unseen world.All humans are also irrational at some point or other. It makes sense that they will be irrational at points about their religion, even the religion that excels in rationality. In that aspect, much of modern Western atheism is a rejection of the humanity of themselves and the people around them.

Does the implication of your Shivatheism occupy your thoughts a lot? Do you derive ethical or existential implications from the fact that you do not believe in Shiva? Do you have clubs where you meet with other people who don‚Äôt believe in Shiva and have debates about why you don‚Äôt believe in him and how that makes you a better person that the Hindoo?All humans are also irrational at some point or other.The difference is that religious people KNOW their beliefs are irrational ‚Äì it‚Äôs sort of a selling point. Vaxxers and warmers hold irrational beliefs but they are not aware of it, they think their beliefs are rational.

        Christianity in the English-speaking world has come to mean ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and the New Religion is antiwhite
That was something I could never put my finger on as a normie as the atheists were hyped not because of some rigorous adherence to ‚Äúreason‚Äù but because of hatred of White people and the structures that make up their societies.  Along those lines, I saw a tweet from Keith Woods pondering if Islam is the fix, which of course gets it backwards as they hate the people, not the faith.

            I think if we look into the book of Acts we will find a section where the apostles of Christianity were given a dream to go west into Greece and Asia Minor and not east into Persia and India.Perhaps Christianity is first ‚Äù white‚Äù because we were best suited and prepared for it in the west.But that was then.

                St. Thomas the Apostle is traditionally said to be the Apostle to India, so they did go to India. A lot of the early Christians were Hellenistic Jews, so Greece is a natural choice.  My reading of Acts is Peter chose Rome because Rome was the political/cultural center of the known world at that point, and therefore would spread Christianity to the far reaches.  If apostolic times were in the 1990s, he quite probably would have picked DC or New York.

        Well, government legitimacy has been based on supernatural belief for a long time. (Mt Olympus, Isis/Osiris, Mandate of Heaven, ‚ÄúDieu et mon droit‚Äù, ‚ÄúOne Nation under God‚Äù etc). Getting rid of this time-tested foundation is a big risk for global Elites. Turning everyone into depraved, godless savages may not work out so well for the rulers.

        I‚Äôve long been a skeptic of religion, but in recent years have fully embraced the view that religion is a necessary part of human societies.  Christianity is at the very foundation of Western Civilization, as much a part of us as our Greek and Roman heritage is; if it dies, the West goes with it.  At the same time, I just don‚Äôt see how to reconcile our scientific understanding of the world with a belief in the supernatural.  Atheism has major problems as Zman points out, but so too does belief in the supernatural.  As much as I might want the universe to care about me and my wants, as far as I can tell, it does not, and operates according to rules and laws that seem coldly indifferent to the affairs of men.  At this point, I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs possible to revive Christianity in the West.  Scientific discoveries have replaced nearly all supernatural explanations for natural phenomena, even though a strong case could be made that rejection of the supernatural is leading to our destruction.

            One can be a skeptic without requiring everyone else be a skeptic. This is one of the biases the atheist inherit from Abrahamic religions. That is, if a belief is correct, it must be enforced.

                This is certainly true, and one reason why I‚Äôve told friends and acquaintances that I would actually be OK with the United States having Christianity as its official state religion.  It would be much easier, for example, to keep the perverts out of the public sphere and sequestered away in prison if Christian moral claims were brought back into our legal system.  Most religious people I know don‚Äôt seem to get hung up on the details of whether or not their beliefs are true, at least in the way a scientist might approach claims about the supernatural.  I‚Äôm a STEM guy so I tend to think a lot about how the natural world works, but I understand I‚Äôm the exception and not the norm.

                    If the guiding principle of your society‚Äôs ethics is just some sort of vague ‚Äúuniversal morality‚Äù or ‚Äújust be a good person‚Äù, then it ultimately becomes whatever the people in power say it is. If the people in power are Christians, there is no problem, really. Everything works more or less fine. If the people in power hate Christians and hate Christ, then you have a big problem. If they also happen to be a pervert who wants to be in the public square, you have a big problem. That is what we have today.

                Depends on the importance of the correct belief. If religions important to man, it should be enforced.Catholicism was the state religion of Columbia until Paul6 leaned on the country to embrace vatican2s religious freedom dogma. Before that, jehovas witnesses couldn‚Äôt go a knockin. Protestants couldn‚Äôt spread their poison publicly. I would have to check to see if Protestant churches were allowed to exist, maybe they were but you couldn‚Äôt spread the nihilism of Protestantism as some sort of fargin ‚Äúright‚Äù!the government can‚Äôt get in your mind. So you can refuse in your mind, but who says the government has to respect muh all religions, and various brands of Protestantism?

                So you are happy with the functional results of religion, but can‚Äôt really be troubled with supporting an actual religion? This is the big problem that we have in our present society in that we have been enjoying living with the positive effects that Christianity has produced but we don‚Äôt want to make any effort to support the Church so it can continue to produce these positive outcomes. We don‚Äôt want to let that ‚Äúreligion stuff‚Äù get in the way of enjoyment of some of the decadent products of our prosperity (materialism, porn, weed, sex outside of marriage, etc.) but by all means you other people support it so we can have the good outcomes and less social pathologies but me, I‚Äôll be watching football or golfing on Sunday morning. Perhaps it is time for men to realize that even if you are not always enthusiastic about getting yourself to church on Sunday morning and supporting church activities, perhaps it is a price that you have to pay so your children and grandchildren can grow up in a decent society. Please don‚Äôt tell me that there are no decent traditional churches left because there are many and the churches that are woke wouldn‚Äôt have went that way if the men hadn‚Äôt abandoned their responsibilities to the women.

                        Perhaps I should have said ‚Äúone of the major problems‚Äù but destroying the moral system that built and upholds your society through malice or apathy is certainly one of the reasons why we are where we are.

            Good post.The only thing I can add is that the ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù helps to fill in the gaps that science can‚Äôt explain. I went from considering the priesthood and being a Pastor, to believing because of what I see. How else would one explain the order of the universe?Im not saying it‚Äôs perfect, but how do cells ‚Äúknow‚Äù how to divide to create life. How do amino acids combine to make blue eyes, or a tall or short person.Maybe it‚Äôs sophomoric, but entropy is a law, and yet nature typically finds a way to keep order.I often think that if God,(the uncaused first cause) whispered in my ear the reason and explanation of everything, I wouldn‚Äôt understand a word that was said.

                    It makes perfect sense once you think about how you explain complex concepts to very small children.  They don‚Äôt deal in terms of abstraction.  So you have to use small words and speak slowly and leave out a lot of details.You have to dumb it down.

Ninety-nine percent of the human body is comprised of 6 simple elements (Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, calcium and phosphorous). How did these simple elements come together at random, in such a way as to create something so infinitely complex that it can split the atom, travel to other planets, and even contemplate its own existence? Yet we cannot take these same simple elements and create a single-celled organism in a lab, with our supercolliders, harnessed nuclear power and electron microscopes.

            ‚ÄúScientific discoveries have replaced nearly all supernatural explanations for natural phenomena‚Äù
Somehow I can‚Äôt wrap my head around this.  Not to get off into the weeds, but where does Christianity claim or is considered, in the main, some sort of ‚Äúscientific‚Äù explanation for the world around us as verses a ‚Äúmoral teaching‚Äù?  In short, how to live decent lives in this fallen world?
Look, you could point to a part of the Bible stating that the world rests on the ‚Äúback of a turtle‚Äù and it would not change my respect for Christianity one iota.

                There are two that science has not really breached: the origins of the universe and the nature of consciousness.

                    If Social Science were to be considered a legitimate field of scientific inquiry, I would argue that ‚Äúscientific discovery‚Äù hasn‚Äôt even figured out the basics of human relationships, communication, etc. because it cannot predict the future of all things.  Christianity, in particular, deals with morality, love, forgiveness, death, and the hereafter.  None of these can presently be explained by ‚Äúscience‚Äù.  All the Social Scientists are able to do is generate observations, not predictions.Einstein‚Äôs theories were able to accurately predict the deflection of light around the sun that emanated from stars trillions of miles away to 8-zeros of precision.  There is no science of human study that can accurately predict with absolute certainty whether some bozo in traffic is about to run a red light and kill some random passerby tomorrow.It is unknowable.  And that is where God lives.

            My devout‚Äìif not terribly pious‚ÄìChristianity is rooted primarily in the direct and very tangible experience of divine intercession.

                Indeed, sir, you Have Been, and Will Be.Science addresses one magisterium, faith another. Have I always known this? Yes, intuitively, and it‚Äôs not dualism, I am talking about spiritual and material realities in coexistence.It is very simple, and frictionless, for me, and I am always astounded at how difficult a problem it is for so many.

                Your experience is personal and anecdotal, yes. But it is one of billions of data points of individuals with similar experiences.  Science would say not to disregard data points, even if there is no visible proof of a causal relationship.  Yet those espousing atheism in the name of science claim billions of organisms acting in a similar fashion is just voodoo.

            ‚ÄúScientific discoveries have replaced nearly all supernatural explanations for natural phenomena.‚Äù  This is simply not true.  Science is no where near explaining how life came from non-life and order came from chaos.  The best science can do is conjecture about magic lightening strikes into some random chemical mixture.  Until the last century, science had the origin of the universe and earth completely wrong.  Until a Jesuit priest proposed the big bang theory less than 100 years ago, science believed the universe always existed.  The Genesis account of creation was written over 3,000 years ago, but the science just caught up with it in terms of the big bang, the dark earth covered in water, surrounded by dense clouds, to the creation of the atmosphere, to plate tectonics, and finally to the evolution of life ‚Äì from plant life and sea based creatures, to birds, to land based animals, to humans.¬†How did the writer of Genesis get the exact sequencing correct with no scientific tools or fossil records, over 3,000 years before the science concurred?

Many of these ‚Äúnew atheists‚Äù are not scientists. They are more like commentators claiming to speak for science. There are any number of practicing scientists who readily admit their lack of understanding at this point in the game‚Äîthat their tools to understanding nature have limits. The honest ones admit such and move on. Roger Penrose is one such example. He is an honest agnostic (IMO).  Contrary to Felix‚Äôs definition, there are such people.

                And then imagine God having to tell that story to a bunch of pre-writing goat herders who could only pass on what they learned through oral tradition‚Ä¶I think where people struggle with God in the modern age is they think God is or ought to be George Burns walking around interacting with humans.It was when I stopped trying to explain everything and just listened that I started to realize there are no coincidences.  That thing was put there in front of me, a choice, an event, another person,for a reason.A few weeks ago my daughter applied for a job.  She worked incredibly hard and made it through 3-4 interviews.  It looked like a lock and she expected to hear something the following week.Monday rolls around and I‚Äôm walking down the hall at work and I felt something strike my head, boom!  But it wasn‚Äôt physical.  It was like when you fall backwards just as you drift off to sleep‚Ä¶that feeling of falling.  I stopped mid-stride and thought, ‚ÄúSomething is wrong.‚Äù  Then, ‚ÄúOh no, she didn‚Äôt get the job!‚ÄùI kept it to myself for 2 days.

                After reading thru this thread, finally the essence of a creative force is brought up. ‚ÄúSomething from nothing‚Äù and we are barely cognizant of the something bit and don‚Äôt even have a clue about the nothing bit, or the transition between them. We are related more closely to viruses than the creative force, however it manifests itself and I don‚Äôt expect viruses to understand diff eq any time soon, nor us the creative forces.Being mortal myself, I always thought religion provides us with method of coping with our own mortality, not just public morality. Perhaps I missed the comment regarding this aspect of religion.

            It‚Äôs not clear to me which supernatural events in the New Testament are explained by scientific discoveries.  It‚Äôs not even clear to me that things like the biblical plagues are explained away by science.  Maybe Adam and Eve are a myth, but the bible is the Word of God as given to us.  It would not be surprising to learn that God had to dumb it down a bit for a bunch of people living in tents herding sheep.  Jesus spoke in parables largely because he was trying to make complex concepts about love and forgiveness understandable.Sure, it‚Äôs true that thunder and lightning are probably not caused by some small-g god of the ancient world.  But that does not disprove all religions equally.  The bible does not claim to predict the weather.

        I‚Äôve never been particularly religious myself, but have never denounced or held negative feelings for those who are.  Religion fills a lot of voids in some people‚Äôs lives and if it lifts them up, it‚Äôs all good as far as I‚Äôm concerned.  And the fact is, no one knows with 100% certainty that God does not exist ‚Äì but in the end, we‚Äôre all going to find out.  Further, over the years, I‚Äôve come to despise the fervent atheists, who are absolutely convinced they‚Äôre right and anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree is an idiotic simpleton ‚Äì and of course there are never any consequences for their dirtbag sacrilegious blasphemies.

                        It‚Äôs quite common where I live, at least if you factor in that right-wingers are a bit thin on the ground to begin with.
Religion and politics are only weakly correlated in Scandiland ‚Äì there‚Äôs a slight bias towards Christians being more to the right, but virtually all the priests we have in Denmark are raging Commies, probably because they are civil servants beholden to government.

If you want to get away from Leftist clergy‚Äìand who doesn‚Äôt?‚Äìyou must venture into Orthodoxy or some of the more homespun, grassroots churches. Or you must home worship with fellow rightwing believers.

        ‚ÄúThis is the problem for late-empire America and the West in general. Once the medieval Christian conception of God was removed, the entire moral superstructure of the West began to faulter.‚ÄùIt is the problem with the Cold War. Russia went down the road of non-belief and total destruction of tradition.For the GAE and its vassals in The West, they threw everything away to try and convince the potential satraps in the 3rd World to join the GAE. Hey! We put you above us in our homeland. We value your diaspora above our own people. That happened with Africa and LatAm 50s ‚Äì now. It happened with Islam for the GWOT.Like the cat lady/wine-aunt who throws everything away to show her moral credentials, they have put us all on a pyre to get this magical new market.

Yes, but one must note that when Putin came to power he found an Orthodox Church quite healthy, organized, and in good working order.  He (wisely) embraced it and never looked back.  That the Church could suffer 70+ years of communist repression and rebound has to give us hope‚Äîas well as lend credence to Z-man‚Äôs thoughts.

                My heritage came from one of those commie Orthodox countries. I think what happened there was analogous to the race religion in this country. People are publicly color blind, but behind the closed doors, they still have their prejudices. In fact, enforced kumbaya probably amplifies many of those prejudices because people don‚Äôt like being told what to do and what to thinkLikewise with Christianity. My uncle was a teacher. When my grandfather died, his funeral was going to be at a church. People told him it would look bad if he attended the funeral. He still went. It was his dad and he‚Äôs a believer. Governments come and go.So, with Putin, who was baptized as a child, Christianity never died out. It was just something you did behind closed doors because it was publicly discouraged.Kind of like what is happening in this country. The parallels to the Soviet Union never cease to amaze me. But fortunately, the boomers are dying out and hopefully their ideas will be dead and buried along with them.

The Boomers are a mixed bag, you‚Äôre just looking at one side of the coin.  Nonetheless, it may be a tough recovery wrt religiosity and Christianity in particular in the West.The Jewish tradition has a precept of the highest order‚Ä¶that the most important duty is for a father to teach his son Torah!  In that manner, some religious indoctrination is passed across generations.  Some descendants become weaker in the religion, others stronger, obviously.There really is little difference with Christianity.  My father was never really religious, but he made sure to attend church with me and send me to Catholic Parochial schools.  I for my children‚Äînothing!Yes, nothing.  We tried once, but failed due to our then spiritual weakness and selfishness.  So here I am at the end of my days on this earth and the realization of the importance of my early experiences and that, of all things of importance to pass down, I failed in this one simple duty.The point?  If/when the children of the Boomers or Millennials come to Christianity, it may take aproselytizingexperience.  Not much different from early missionaries visiting foreign lands full of pagans.

        The Enlightenment project to substitute reason and rationality as the basis for ought claims rather than God and the transcendent has failed. However, for a certain class of people you would never know it, for new atheism and the Enlightenment serve to differentiate between the Enlightened and the Ignorant, the Serious and the Unserious, the Real vs. the Imaginary. More importantly, it feeds the ego of those who believe themselves evolved beyond religion. In that sense, while New Atheism joins the dustbin of history along with other failed modern ideologies, I doubt its adherents will let go.

As much as I respect him, from his book trial of Socrates, g Johnson implies that religion is fake but people need an religion except for the over man. If I‚Äôm misreading it, I apologize.the problem here is which religion. If it‚Äôs a matter of ‚Äúculture‚Äù then religion truly is fake in a way. It proves that there is a true religion. If man must have religion to govern his life, and there are a number of choices, then one of them must be true, otherwise th whole thing is a scam and we are on our own.good grief Lindsey graham is talking about Iran ‚Ä¶

        it was the death by 1000 cuts, the infiltration of the catholic church (by non-christians) was also damaging the cause long before the new atheists came around. the likes of dawkins, harris et al saw the blood in the water and pounced. The midwits fell for it and went all in, academia even more so, the ‚Äúit takes a community to raise a child‚Äù group sacrificed the kids to their new god of swf and tranny teachers, not to mention the damage 10x more vaccinations is doing to their mental development and overall health.All along there were those saying that ‚Äúif we did not have religion, we‚Äôd have to invent it‚Äù but that statement involved too much thinking to appreciate or achieve pop-culture status.

            I was blue pilled until around a decade ago and I only started to see the cracks on the wall around 15 years ago despite being a devout Catholic, then lapsed, when young.I am a STEM professional with a drop of autism so I do not represent the average person. That said, I really was into the matrix, daily NYT reader, The Daily Show fan, IFLS subscriber‚Ä¶ Midwit all the way.In retrospect I see the power of the machine as many seeds of my mental jail were planted by a good high school education that drilled the ‚Äúliberalism is peace and prosperity‚Äù gospel into my brain. The whole WW1 WWII history is a tale for children, but it is in history books, 100 documentaries in the History channel (when it was like Nazi History channel LOL), Spielberg over manipulative movie, etc, etc.Then I could be a Catholic, but with liberal leanings, unironically. It also helped that the degeneracy was low in public spaces and there was something idyllic about growing up in the 80s, so all the rotten tissue was not apparent.Somehow I also got the conviction, like many others, from college (this is called default settings by some podcaster) that Dems=saints, GOP=‚Äôcrazy bigots that go against evident morals‚Äô from the TV. I was a true NPC.As it is frequent I was pushed to the right by the 2016 events, but I started around 2017-18 with the DW and Dave Rubin of all people. And then the NYT fears came true, you see an interview in Dave Rubin (or Joe Rogan) with X, X interviews Y, and then Y interviews RamZ Paul and you are now far right, congratulations!A second event was my very Catholic TLM friend recommending the red pill forum on Reddit. He was redpilled by his marriage and then I remember being at the heartiste blog disgusted by the comments. Innocence days. Now I see where the ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù came from and I see that we were really subverted by dark forces since the 1700s at least. As the recent olympic games show Christianity was the enemy of the sexual deviant ideologies from the start and they will kill Western civilization to have 5 minutes of hedonistic pleasure. True demons.Add to the sexual perversion our financial slavery via the federal reserve, Woodrow Wilson, the creation of the spy state‚Ä¶ you know the drill.As many others say, this does not make me automatically a Catholic, but I get why we need a Trad Catholic morality in place as the official religion of the USA.

                My path involves the majority of yours, along with few others. Z has certainly provided a significant amount of resources. Peter Bogosian  was doing some interesting work on how you ‚Äúknow‚Äù what you believe is true, which oddly enough I used to debunk the new atheists down to the level of the most deceptive of false establishment religions. I‚Äôve since found a local Baptist church that does a good job of explaining the Bible in a manner that convinces me my early instincts of wondering wtf was wrong with the catholic church that I had come to hate so much. I cheered when I found these new atheists, that‚Äôs how much of a con I thought organized religion was.My greatest shame now is having once put sam harris in the same category as Z as an influential thinker. The left-wing loon trick of using all the right words in a sentence or paragraph (that ultimately meant absolutely  nothing without my bias filling in the blanks) was effective on me for a while. That, I will never forget, I pray I can be forgiven, may my membership fee be my penance.Owen Benjamin is a pretty good spell breaker.Legalman over at the Quash and his bits on Lysander Spooner occasionally make me rage at the current corruption in every western country.the crew over at radio Albion are very decent.the material provided by the attendees of this blog‚Ä¶the value is beyond calculating.

        The impact of the demise of Christianity in the West is intertwined with the new morality coming from a hostile tribe that hates Christianity, Christians and normal life.Maybe white civilizations that moved away from Christianity could have stayed functional as has China without religion. However, when the people who led the way for the destruction of Christianity have a very long track record of successfully introducing and promoting dreadful moral views that undermine normal life, the West simply can‚Äôt survive the shift away from Christianity.In Western white countries even the churches have largely abandoned Christianity and are now pagan temples for worshipping the tribe and its destructive morality.

        ‚ÄúOne of the cornerstone beliefs must be that there are bits of this code that are off-limits to questioning, as they are too important to put to a vote.‚ÄùWho decides that though? Every single time a religion spreads it gets morphed to match the population, why there‚Äôs so many denominations. The bible itself certainly made being transformed every which way very easy to do with its seemingly endless interpretative contradictions. That was also done deliberately to make it more palatable to the various peoples the missionaries were spreading it to.Then theres the glaring flaw that Christianity plays fast &amp; loose with important realities like genetics. Splashing holy water on jews did not transform them into compatible people who could be trusted to not subvert the faith which is exactly what happened. It‚Äôs inherent universalism also lent itself to the subversive progressive movement &amp; was the north‚Äôs moral justification for the civil war that ultimately unleashed feral negroes upon America.Unless you have enough homogeneity to reach a consensus or the might to enforce your moral will someone else who does have the means will do it instead. Right now the moral consensus is dysgenic supremacy &amp; zionism.The fact is religion &amp; morality are inescapably linked to genetics, you can dump a thousand gallons of holy water on a quaker or bantu &amp; they‚Äôll still be degenerates, nothing short of putting a gun to their heads will make them behave. In the case of the latter not even that is enough to make them behave &amp; the former who share so many qualities with jews despite the genetic differences will constantly try to undermine traditional Christian values as long as they‚Äôre allowed to exist in your society.Christianity used to have a way to solve these genetic problems by proxy via labeling degenerates as witches or satanists or whatever &amp; kill them, problem solved. Unfortunately that requires a population that is willing to do what‚Äôs necessary to protect civilization &amp; that currently doesn‚Äôt exist. In fact the most populous demographic is currently doing that to people like us. The fact it ended up this way was due at least in part to universalism, it wasn‚Äôt that long ago that genetic freaks were sterilized but the dysgenic supremacists managed to shut that down with their interpretation of Christianity as the moral justification.Christianity always worked best when the latent universalism &amp; implicit denials of genetics was ignored in favor of hardline ethnocentrism &amp; tribalism. Problem is that the further away from harsh living conditions you get the less militant people tend to be about those things which is why liberalism became ever more prevalent with ease of living. After the industrial revolution that went completely off the rails with the dysgenic molding society in their image &amp; Christianity provided no real counterpoint to that happening, in fact it helped it along indirectly by promoting things that were suddenly maladaptive due to the environment.It made sense to be extremely against abortion with a high child mortality rate &amp; an environment that naturally wiped out dysgenic genes but not so much when virtually every single child born is artificially kept alive. Especially doesn‚Äôt make sense to have that policy when the healthy population that actually contributes to society is financially enslaved to house &amp; feed the parasitical dysgenic population &amp; their offspring. That policy of deliberately breeding dysgenic people also lowers the birthrates of the genetically fit via stealing their money &amp; making the environment a hostile place both through their mere presence alone &amp; from the policies they vote for.Somehow I doubt God wanted this outcome &amp; I sincerely doubt he‚Äôd agree with the platitude about protecting the unborn when it is known through probability that many of those unborn will grow up to murder &amp; rape innocent people. I also doubt he‚Äôd morally justify the creation of millions of new democrat voters who will further influence society to be even more hostile to his religion. If I‚Äôm wrong on that then I‚Äôd have to agree with the leftist Christian belief that we‚Äôre currently living a golden age of the faith &amp; the utopia is nearly upon us.The fact the faith can be twisted to give moral justification for your own extinction is a serious problem for Europeans who are so prone to sentimentality &amp; individualism. That‚Äôs coming to a head &amp; will be resolved one way or another whether that means Christianity is abandoned by western Whites, Whites cease to exist or the faith is reconfigured to acknowledge &amp; give proper guidance on issues related to tribe, race &amp; genetics.The faith needs to change to account for modernity removing harsh conditions &amp; any semblance of selection pressure, neither of which is natural. Over eighty percent of the human genome pertains to the brain so unlike animals when defective mutations happen it rarely has a physical manifestation. I have a hard time believing otherwise well meaning Christians would support artificially keeping deformed animals alive to breed them &amp; morally justify it as a good thing the same way they do with humans. Key word being well meaning, I have no doubt in my mind that new england Christians would support dysgenic breeding even if it was physically visible. They‚Äôre currently worshipping &amp; importing negroes &amp; putting pride flags outside their churches which is basically dysgenic iconography. That‚Äôs whose been running the country since the end of the civil war so its no surprise that they handed so much power to jews who are their spiritual kin.Playing fast &amp; loose with acknowledging such an important reality as genetics, not just race, needs to be solved if Christianity is to return to being a unabashedly positive influence on White people. There‚Äôs just no way around that now, before the industrial revolution the implicit denial of genes &amp; pie in the sky universalism was naturally blunted by the environment but that‚Äôs gone &amp; the faith has had no real answer to it.

        I‚Äôm a contrarian by nature. I doubt everything but something our church architect once told me stuck with me. He said if you look at the human body, to him it‚Äôs analogous to designing a building. The human body has plumbing, wiring, different mechanicals that do different things for the body. It‚Äôs impossible that this happened on its own, trillions of years of pond scum gestating. It looks like somebody had to build it.Then you look at things like the ozone, magnetic fields, the Van Allen Belt. That didn‚Äôt just all happen on its own. It seems to me somebody had to build that too.Jesus and Christianity? Above my pay grade, but there must be something to it. It created the best living conditions on this world ever. Everybody else lived in relative and sometimes not so relative squalor.

            This is a point I make about space aliens.  When you factor in all of the perfect things that had to happen ‚Äújust so‚Äù for us to get to this point in human civilization, it just staggers the mind.just the right kind of star in just the right part of the galaxy formed from just the right composition of former stars and galaxies that formed 13B, 10B, 5B years ago (you can‚Äôt get the elements you need without supernovas‚Ä¶and gosh do those take some time to plan!)just the right size orbit at just the right distancejust the right number of planets in front and behind usJupiter just the right size to deflect some ‚Äì but not all ‚Äì asteroids, but just small enough to not ignite itself into a second stara moon just the right size and distance to stabilize the orbitjust the right amount of tectonic plate movement andjust the right number of extinction events at just the right times to allow a fossil fuel based industrial civilization to emerge.  (You can‚Äôt go to the moon burning wood), and you don‚Äôt get coal and oil without plate tectonics.  You can‚Äôt even build a radio without complex carbon chains.just the right life forms preceded us to terraform the planet (humans couldn‚Äôt even breath the atmosphere as it existed 1B years ago‚Ä¶)just the right number of ice ages and just the right interregnum between ice ages at just the right temperaturejust the right society emerges with just the right beliefs to take advantage of the planet‚Äôs resourcesand on and on and on‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just staggering.And we haven‚Äôt all killed each other yet.  Scientists talk Goldilocks planets like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the answer!‚Äù  No, it‚Äôs not.  Maybe you get some algae, or termites if you‚Äôre lucky.  To get us?  Where we are today?  It probably required 25% of what we call the Milky Way worth of raw materials just to get the right conditions to maybe get things going.We were put here for a reason.  And the odds of us bumping into intelligent life in the cosmos are pretty small because if any of those ‚Äújust the right‚Ä¶‚Äù goes just the wrong, you don‚Äôt even get radio signals, let alone interplanetary space travel.  Or they vaporize themselves in a nuclear war.We‚Äôre not out of the woods yet, but I have hope because again: reason.

        I have been wrestling with Alex O‚ÄôConnor for quite sometime and while I enjoy his debates, it simply reminds me again of Christopher Hitchens (a noted tear down artist and sophist)- ironically it was Alex who made a comprehensive vlog of Hitchens‚Äô sophistry (up on YouTube).He then recently interviewed (tried) Peter Hitchens and that went nowhere (Peter walked off the set). At this point outside of him doing interviews with Pints w/Aquinas, I don‚Äôt think he stands for anything and certainly would never apply his reductionism to any biological questions of ethnicity and race. The same with @ Rationality Rules for that matter.Harris is and always will be a mostly dishonest phony who loved making appeals to the psychological, but then ü§• by omission the claims of collective biology and in group preference.

        Having worked through the comments, here are my philosophical thoughts for the day:There needs to be some clarity on the meaning of words. There are belief systems, and while every religion is a belief system, not every belief system is a religion. Atheism, like any cult, is a belief system; it is not a religion. Communism, veganism, climate alarmism, mask-fetishism, Jonesism, Randism (or whatever it was called), you name it, are belief systems, but to call them religions is as wrong as wrong can be.Areligionis a particular belief system that incorporatesauthoritativetraditions, institutions, texts, holy days, festivals, and so on. In other words, religion is what informs a well-defined society over a long period of time. It infuses its believers with a sense of community and a common purpose. It is the architecture upholding family, social relations, and government.In its more energetic forms, religion can get out of hand, as it did in Japan in 1944-1945, central Europe in the Thirty Years‚Äô War, and in the Saracen conquests, as obvious examples. Throw in Plymouth ca. witch trials and, yeah. Religion can get out of hand.It‚Äôs also true that religions start as cults. Buddhism started as a cult of personality, as did both Christianity and Mohammadism. They developed, however, into what I have quickly attempted to summarize as religions: Belief systems to be sure, but mature well beyond their cultic origins, taking root and growing into the fundamental bases for long-standing cultures and civilizations.It‚Äôs not impossible that atheism could eventually emerge as such a foundation for a future society, and indeed become a religion. France‚Äôs revolutionaries tried for it in the 1790s; didn‚Äôt work out. Russia‚Äôs new order of 1917 tried for it; didn‚Äôt work out (Stalin needed the Church in the Great Patriotic War). The Church survived Stalin, as we know today‚Ä¶Atheism?In North Korea, at a glance perhaps the most ‚Äúatheistic‚Äù country on the planet, the Kim family are public gods; find a picture somewhere of the massive statues of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, with submissive subjects placing flowers at their bronze feet, much as Aztecs, I suppose, supplicated Huitzilopochti.That‚Äôs your atheism right there. New gods, ruling through fear and placated only by sacrifice. There is no alternative; the secular expression for atheism is simply nihilism, and no society ‚Äì from a small tribe to a vast empire ‚Äì can live off nihilism.PaceDawkins and Harris and Christopher Hitchens, I‚Äôll take my ‚Äúsky fairy‚Äù over their counter offer.

        What everybody misses, both religious and atheists, is function. Function is the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, even, ultimately, of morality.But I‚Äôm not going into that. Instead, reading about Rhodesia, I figured out who the Whore of Babylon is.Rhodesia was pretty much single-handedly destroyed by an evil nigger named Andrew Young, the American ambassador from 1977-79.This evil nigger could not have happened without those mulatto human demons, the Jews.The Jews would not be in power were it not for their much-abused Bride. Gangsta beats her, gangsta rapes her, gangsta kills her, but she still worships, adores, and fucks Gangsta. She even give all her money to Gangsta. She give her children to Gangsta.  She do anything for Gangsta.She be a feminized bitch. Who bitch dis is?

        A recent Harris book, fortunately short, was on ‚ÄúFree Will.‚Äù It boiled down to saying recent biochemical-electrical research shows everything we think, including free will, is just chemicals reacting in our brains.

        Imperium Press has a good series on religious traditions and morality, essentially saying it is a primordial command that is not up or debate. It is then transmitted to a folk who continues obeying the command and passing it to their children, then their children‚Äôs children. Their argument is it‚Äôs the core prerequisite of being a people, and once a folk stop obeying the command, they stop being a people.
The core issue with the New Atheists is they assume morality is a science that can be dissected and studied. It‚Äôs not, and points to something even deeper than science.

            Not very far from my thinking. I believe physics implies the multiverse and more than one reality (NOT relevant for everyday life just to be clear). It is hard to differentiate between a universe as a subset of another and a simulation, especially when you know nothing about what/who erected that one way barrier between the subset and the greater universe

                    But philosophically, the guy creating the simulation is himself subject to laws of nature, as is the hardware the sim runs on, even if those laws are different from the laws inside the simulation.
E.g., you don‚Äôt need to be omnipotent or omniscient to run a simulation, but that is what we‚Äôre expected to believe about God.

                        Yes but he is in another reality. That is why ours is a simulation from his pov. It is easy to make a simulation where there is a slight variation on some natural law like gravity or nuclear forces. From the perspective of that simulation, gravity is as we defined it. That‚Äôs the point of the simulation of course, to see what would happen.There are strong reasons, but not unanimous agreement of course, to think that physics demands multiple dimensions of time and space not accessible to us. This has profound implications for any conception of the nature of reality. Starting with tending the probability of there being only one reality strongly towards zero. So now we have multiple realities, many of them mutually exclusive. But that‚Äôs not a problem; from their pov they are each reality and the others are undefined. From their pov the same applies except that they are the defined ones. Your theories sir, are excellent Victorian bed time stories.

        Liberalism, the notion that all men are created equal is rooted in Christianity.   With the irrelevance of Christianity to future generations we will eventually see the death of liberalism.   At least that is my hope.  Then the new elite class that forms can build a new ethical structure for the plebs.  One that is not so cucked.

        ‚ÄúIf you rip out God from the equation, then all things are permitted unless you can find a reasonable argument against it.‚ÄùNot necessarily. There is the idea of karma, which is quite independent of any notion of divinity, and which you find in Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism. If you do bad things the negative karma will come back and bite you in the ass. If you do good things, those deeds and intents get credited to your account and buy you a better life here or in the next incarnation.The Catholic idea of hell, purgatory, and paradise (as in Dante‚Äôs ‚ÄúDivine Comedy‚Äù) I also find appealing: you are culpable for your sins. What I don‚Äôt understand is people telling me with a straight face (when I point out their failings) that ‚ÄúJesus died for our sins, so everything is hunky-dory.‚Äù Where‚Äôs the individual culpability?

I think empiricism is necessarily atheist, as it‚Äôs evidence-based‚Äî no faith iow. I‚Äôm OK with that, but it‚Äôs not a basis for morality.
If you don‚Äôt have all the answers, and none of us do, you have to take some things on faith, iow, you must have some kind of morality. Scientific/empirical people should know this best and be the most humble about it. They can think it‚Äôs superstition, but what do they know, really?

                The method is atheist, is my point. If God is measurable and comprehensible, God does not exist. If complete knowledge is possible, God does not exist.

                    We don‚Äôt quite agree here, unlike a lot of other times . I think what you describe is closer to the scientific method than to atheism. Atheism is an active belief about something I think us unknowable.
But we already know that there can never be complete knowledge. It starts with Goedel in math, continues with Heisenberg in quantum mechanics. So it is known that knowledge will never be complete, not just in practice. The laws of math and the universe both disallow it

What we think of as God is an understanding built up over millennia, just like everything else humans have managed to pass down. Like I say, I think some people get caught up and miss the point.

            I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms‚Ä¶

        You cannot prove a negative, which means there is no way to prove God does not exist.Just so. That‚Äôs why we usually demand that onus of evidence is on the party making the specific claim about the world. Atheism doesn‚Äôt need to prove anything because atheism makes no positive claims about the universe whatsoever. Christianity ‚Äì like all religions ‚Äì makes extraordinary claims about the nature of the universe but offers zero evidence.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell&#x27;s_teapotIt is why atheists spend all of their time attacking what they claim are the arguments in favor of God, rather than putting together an argument in favor of their godless universe.No argument is needed, as I said, just like I don‚Äôt need to argue ‚Äúin favor‚Äù of a world without fairies, trolls or mermaids.If you rip out God from the equation, then all things are permitted unless you can find a reasonable argument against it.‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt believe that you‚Äôll be tortured in eternal hellfire if you transgress against Jesus, what‚Äôs to stop you from stealing, killing, lying and be desirous of your neighbor‚Äôs cattle?Never mind that this is an extremely creepy notion, but it is not an argument in favor of faith because you cannot make anyone believe supernatural stuff just because it would be beneficial to himself or his society. It‚Äôs like me offering to buy you a Maserati for Christmas if only you‚Äôd agree to believe in Santa.And morals don‚Äôt come from religious texts, rather than the other way around: culture is downstream from biology, ethics is downstream from culture and religion is downstream from ethics. That‚Äôs why religious Minnesota and atheist Sweden are ridiculously alike in ethics and outlook, while Christian New England is very different from Christian Sudan: your local flavor of Christianity mirrors the set of ethic codes your biology dictates.The main reason their project has always failed is that you cannot replace a set of beliefs with nothing.That‚Äôs what every kid does when he stops believing in Santa.The only pro-God argument that ever made me uncomfortable, is the design-argument: look how mindblowingly fantastic all this stuff is put together, you claim it all came about randomly?‚Äù And I‚Äôd have to grit my teeth and say ‚Äúyes‚Äù, because that‚Äôs the best explanation we‚Äôve come up with so far; it‚Äôs not based on rationality, but it is still the most persuasive theistic argument out there.

            Irony of ironies, I can help you with that argument that made you uncomfortable. While still thinking that you misrepresent atheism when you say there is no positive claim in it. We‚Äôve been over that before so I‚Äôll kyst get to the argument: it is not randomness that created complex organisms. A set of three simple nonlinear equations can form fantastic and complex graphs called fractals. This is simply built into math and into physics. Therefore initially simple chemical interactions can form i increasingly complex patterns in both time (oscillations) and space (structures). This is the mathematical foundation for why simple chemistry can blossom into life with enough trial and error. And both in small experiments and in the paleontologal records of earth we see the same pattern; compounded complexity in time, iow complexity grows exponentially, not linearly over time. The ‚ÄúCambrian Explosion‚Äù is an example of this.There are many profound arguments against atheism. But the complexity of life is not one of them

I understand that, and I understand how evolution by natural selection works, and I also noted that the design argument is not based on rationality.
But emotionally, it is extremely powerful and only becomes more so the more you learn about nature. This, most likely, stems from the inability to conceptualize what ‚Äúa billion years‚Äù actually means.
In other words, the best argument for religion is not a real argument at all. If you have any profound arguments against atheism, I‚Äôd love to hear them because that would be a first.

                        We had a interchange about atheism once. I daresay my arguments were logically unassailable‚Ä¶Please refresh my memory. I have had many interchanges about religion over the years, and none of them have led anywhere.I do, of course, not accept that atheism is a belief ‚Äì indeed atheism is not even an -ism because there is no set of dogmas or ethics or system of ideas that is derived from not being superstitious.Thus, one cannot be more or less fanatic about not being superstitious, one simply is or is not. But if you measure fanaticism by how much headspace the question takes up, I daresay I‚Äôm not even lukewarm. If it weren‚Äôt for religion taking up this huge space in dissident right discussions, I‚Äôd happily never talk about it again because, as I said, these discussions are philosophically futile.

Humm, I remember going a round or two with Felix in the past.  Seems we agreed to live and let live, nor did tempers flair and untoward words said.  Respect is the word here.  ‚ÄúFanatic‚Äù is a bit strong.  If all atheists were like Felix, I‚Äôd not need to qualify atheism into ‚Äúnew atheists‚Äù and run of the mill ‚Äúatheists‚Äù like Felix of the old school.

                            Felix is any discussion not involving ultimative reality or physics. I do not wish to offend him. But I think ‚Äúfanatic‚Äù is the correct term for his staunch advocacy of atheism. It is impervious to argument. I say that because, if you walk into the Cavendish lab at Cambridge or the Harvard physics dept and say ‚ÄúI believe there are many universes‚Äù chances are excellent that some of the people you meet will say ‚Äúso do I‚Äù.Now the good Mr Krull is convinced that in none of these universes could something that would be a God, exist. That is not exactly like but sufficiently analogous to use to say it is a bit like me saying that in an infinite row of numbers you will never find my phone number. Mathematically possible. But a very dicey bet.Felix is a good man. But he‚Äôs no physicist and doesn‚Äôt see the far end of his own claims. Besides im a little tired and cranky

The state of best scientific estimate today is uncountably infinite universes (yes some physicists would disagree but most probably wouldn‚Äôt ). That is an interpretation of QM and relativity but a very realistic one. I think you treat this as a Newtonian would. Ie one giant room called space with one universal clock. This is not reality. And that has profound ontological implications.

Do you, for instance, believe that God begat a son with the Virgin Mary?

Probably because all the atheists you‚Äôve met are apostates suffering from red pill rage or, since atheism is reviled in America, they are spiteful mutants being attracted to atheism because of its transgressive role in American life.

        Q. 516. Why can there be only one true religion?A. There can be only one true religion, because a thing cannot be false and true at the same time, and, therefore, all religions that contradict the teaching of the true Church must teach falsehood. If all religions in which men seek to serve God are equally good and true, why did Christ disturb the Jewish religion and the Apostles condemn heretics?

He went to synogue and temple, approved of the priesthood‚Äôs low, worthless sacrifices, and affirmed other nonsense of the torahs of no authority. Jesus‚Äô disciples, on the other hand, believed Trinitarian Christianity, or so the Trinitarian shamans of Rome and Constantinople have led us to believe.The shamans are wrong, of course. Simon and the others were followers of the Levites‚Äô religion, at least while Jesus was alive. They were heretics who accepted Jesus‚Äô false claim, but they were not adherents of Constantine‚Äôs cult. None of them had anything clear and unambiguous to say about the elohim of Gen. 1 being a triune god, and the torahs themselves are so little interested in the concept that they never call the god a trinity even though the trinity is supposed to be the most important fact of existence.Let‚Äôs be clear about the contrast here, just in case you aren‚Äôt following along. There was one religion for the master‚Äîwho pretended to be Israel‚Äôs messiah even though he accomplished few or none of messiah‚Äôs tasks. There was another religion for his idiotic followers who, according to the shamans, believed that Israel‚Äôs messiah was one in being with Israel‚Äôs god. If either of these religions could be true, it‚Äôs only the foundation (which wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúJudaism‚Äù). Both the substance and the appearance of these religions differ, and no honest person confuses Constantine‚Äôs creed with the creed of the Levites. The stock reply to Q. 516 leads straightaway to the conclusion that ‚Äúthe true Church‚Äù teaches a false religion, which is just what we suspected upon learning about the Flood hoax and the tall tale about the god changing the physics of light or water.If all religions in which men seek to serve God‚Ä¶This spurious claim defines religion as a servile idolatry toward an allegedly omnipotent ghost. The shamans say that with the fantom all things are possible, in which case itispossible to demonstrate a negative. Alas, the claim, ‚ÄúYou cannot prove a negative‚Äù, indicates otherwise. If you cannot demonstrate a negative, then you can‚Äôt ‚Äúprove‚Äù that ‚ÄúYou cannot prove a negative‚Äù. (So is it true or not true that you can‚Äôt demonstrate a negative? Is it true but undemonstrable? Hmmm.)Anyway, the clich√© implies that there‚Äôs a human impossibility applying to the Abrahamic superghost, too. A much better example is the demonstration, first given in ancient times, that ‚àö2 is irrational. In other words, it‚Äôs strictly impossible for any and all beings to write a fraction, a/b, which equals ‚àö2, where a and b are integers.Why can there be only one true religion?Loaded question. It presupposes that different religions could not have the same nucleus and aims while maintaining different appearances and completely independent societies and polities. Here again we see Abrahamic narcissism on stilts for all the world to see and, we hope, to knock down forever.

        I think the problem with atheists is that they‚Äôre stupid
lets start with a few facts.  Someone made the universe.  Someone can maybe make his bed.  Someone put you here and can take your life away.   And you can‚Äôt do shit about it.
ok, so clearly there is a superior force or being as to us.  The definition of superior is being able to make you and take you.  Against your will.
call it what you want.  But don‚Äôt be stupid about the reality of the situation.

        How do you figure that‚Ä¶If you rip out God from the equation, then all things are permitted unless you can find a reasonable argument against itPermitted by whom?? Permission is an act of the will. So don‚Äôt you just mean permittedby you? or by some being whom you prefer to believe is an authorized permitter and lawgiver?The very idea of an unwilled law of action and effect is, it seems, completely beyond your ken. Intoxicated you are with egoism, authoritarianism, commandment, obedience, judgement, vengeance called punishment, and the idea that willpower is (more or less) supreme in existence.¬†You and secular democrats and members of the DIE mafia differ much less than you suppose in terms of character and mentality.A problem, tho, for your mastergod is only too obvious. How does it know what is right and wrong, so that it can publish correct mizvot and only correct mitzvot? Does it choose right and wrong arbitrarily or are there objective critieria not subject to mastergod‚Äôs willpower, as say the Buddhas? It would be strange if, assuming this mg‚Äôs existence, right and wrong are not its own choices.You and your fellow theologians insist that mastergod is an omnipotent lawgiver, but there is little in all that Scribbling which suggests that mastergod lacks any control over what is right and wrong. Is mg an obscurantist who isn‚Äôt responsible for morality after all? but who hides its limitations to maintain undeserved respect for itself?Discussing the morality problem directs our attention to another problem. How is mg‚Äôs will about right and wrong, or any other matter, coverted into action? Doesn‚Äôt it need some superior law for this? Here too the Scribbling called torah, neviim, ketuvim, and ‚ÄúNew‚Äù Testament offers little guidance‚Äîjust like it fails to describe well known impossibilities (i.e. limits on willpower) such as writing ‚àö2 as a ratio of integers.So maybe it would be better to back away from that morass of nationalist, Middle Eastern chauvinism. Reject bad tradition in favor of a law and a different god which doesn‚Äôt just fabricate morality but is bound by it no less than humans. Of course, you‚Äôll need to explain why this other, weaker mg has little to say in person or through an authentic torah (teaching) dictated to humans in ancient times. Could it just be that existence has no such master, needs no such master, and would fail to be coherent if such a master existed?

        I would like an atheist to consider that the God of Christianity, if in possession of the powers ascribed to Him, could make it impossible to actually objectively prove His existence.

            I would like an atheist to consider that the God of Christianity, if in possession of the powers ascribed to Him, could make it impossible to actually objectively prove His existence.That would be hilarious if true. Once upon a time, the omnipotent,omniscientgod knew how to rigorously demonstrate His existence with a valid argument which uses only true premises. He chose however not to declare this demonstration, say, to Moshe so that it could be transcribed and published in Scribbling. Instead he willed that such demonstration be impossible, upon which moment knowledge of the demonstration was annihilated from the mind of the omnipotent, omniscient god. Now He is an amnesiac who, we may suspect, can not remember his own act of annihilating some of His knowledge and making its restoration impossible. He cannot remember the extraordinary accomplishment of changing the unchangeable god.

            I‚Äôll be fine, thanks. Not believing in God isn‚Äôt the deep, identity-defining trait that religion is for religious people, at least not in Scandinavia where atheism is the uncontroversial default.I‚Äôve seen videos of what passes for ((atheists)) in America, so I can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt understand the animosity or the misconceptions of what it entails.So I usually ignore all the shit-talk about atheists in the right-o-sphere because it is a sterile conversation as this thread has superabundantly demonstrated, but sometimes you have to put down a marker, especially now where ‚ÄúChristian Nationalism‚Äù is trying to highjack and undermine white identity politics.For the record, I consider Christians allies but I don‚Äôt harp on about it, because for obvious reasons, Christians don‚Äôt appreciate that kind of condescension from a non-believer.

        I‚Äôm probably not going to change anyone‚Äôs mind here, but it‚Äôs worth a try. I‚Äôve often played the Devil‚Äôs, or at least the Atheist‚Äôs, advocate. I‚Äôve read some of the New Atheist books. With time I‚Äôve become, as it were, a lapsed atheist. By that I mean I‚Äôm more of an agnostic.Z here is asserting the superiority of a moral system ‚Äúbackstopped by something that lies outside the reach of man.‚Äù This is a crucial point and one that needs to be examined. If the moral foundations (or authority) are not accessible to Man, how could anyone possibly decide what those standards are? Or is it that a moral code derived from religion ‚Äúare off-limits to questioning‚Äù? If we rely on any human being, even if we believe him, how could we possibly assay his claims of the other world? We could not; we simply have to take him at his word (or not). That observation changes not in the least whether that holy man is a primitve witch doctor or the Pontiff in Rome.Science requires evidence, proofs, etc. Nearly any religion rests upon claims that cannot be falsified, that is, they cannot be tested and shown to be true or false. Even manyworldlybeliefs rest upon ground assumptions that may be correct, but we cannot know for certain. If that‚Äôs true, even the purely secular must take some things on faith, as it were.Nietzsche (you knew I had to drag him in somewhere) had this to say: ‚ÄúEver since the beginning of the world, no authority has permitted itself to be made the subject of criticism; and to criticise morals ‚Äî to look upon morality as a problem, as problematic ‚Äî what! was that not ‚Äî is that not ‚Äî immoral?‚Äù (Dawn of Day, 3). Here, he is not questioning thesourceof authority, only observing that it‚Äôs taboo to question the lawgiver‚Äôs moral code.Wanting some supernatural power(s) to rule over us is an innate human need. Right there we have a whole series of problems: Even if we ‚Äúknow‚Äù that we need one God or a thousand, precisely what form does that deity assume? How do we know any of this? Was it from divine revelation? From traditions handed down to us by our family, our community, our tribe? Or (let‚Äôs be honest here) isn‚Äôt it possible that we‚Äôre just making up reassuring shit out of whole cloth that likely has little to no basis in reality?It seems to me one of the most potent arguments against there being one or more Deities is simply he sheer number of belief systems. Christianity alone has 25,000 denominations. Do the Southern Primitive Reformed Holly Roller Baptists really have a lock on divine revelation, or should I stick with Mother Church? Or do we give them both a pass, because they claim to believe in the Judeo-Christian God? And we haven‚Äôt even gotten into the other Abramic faiths (Islam and Judaism), not to mention Hinduism and a long list of other religions around the globe. There‚Äôs a veritable universe of belief systems available. Don‚Äôt like any in stock? Customize one to your own tastes, or create a brand-new one from scratch!They can‚Äôt all be right.Note that I‚Äôm not denying that all this stuff (the universe) had to come from somewhere, But isn‚Äôt it honest, even if somewhat ego-deflating, to admit that at least with the tools of convention science and reason, that we most likely will never find the First Cause, the origin of all this?Nor do I deny that for optimum functioning a group, whether it‚Äôs an isolated tribe or a great nation, should have a moral code, system of laws, etc. that is agreed to by nearly all citizens. Unfortunately, ‚Äúoptimum‚Äù is rarely available, especially on a worldwide scale.By all means find a faith that works for you. But don‚Äôt be surprised when nearly everyone else has their own ideas. I freely admit that I don‚Äôt know all the answers, but I do claim enough wisdom to know that some questions remain inaccessible to human inquiry. And as you may have guessed, I have abundant skepticism.I‚Äôll let Eric Idle close us out on a lighter note (from Monty Python‚Äôs ‚ÄúGalaxy Song‚Äù):So remember when you‚Äôre feeling very small and insecureHow amazingly unlikely is your birthAnd pray that there‚Äôs intelligent life somewhere up in space‚ÄòCause there‚Äôs bugger all down here on Earth!

        One aspect of Christianity and Islam is that they are historical religions:  they rely on the existence of certain historical events that took place in 1st Century Palestine or 5th Century Arabia as the basis for their teachings and the way to personal salvation: Jesus Christ was crucified and resurrected and Mohammed received a revelation about the nature of God.  Eastern religions, by contrast, are a more ‚Äúhere are a set of moral and ethical principles, take it or leave it.‚Äù  Judaism is ‚Äúfollow the law.‚Äù  Christianity has been subject to higher criticism for about two hundred years‚Äìscholars reading the four canonical gospels and comparing them with archeology, the known history and literature of the time are pretty much convinced that there is little or no historical basis for the contents of the gospels‚Äìthey are a form of literature.  I think that there is some similar skepticism about the origins or Islam, but Muslims are much less tolerant of efforts to question the underlying basis of their religion.  Ergo,it‚Äôs hard to be a Christian if you‚Äôre just convinced ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù  I suppose there are similar apostate Muslims, but they understandably maintain a low profile.  For these reasons, I am skeptical that there will ever be a Christian revival along the lines of the 18th and 19th Century Great Awakenings.  Could some form of Buddhism, Hinduism, or Confuscianism be adapted to the West?

            Confucianism is Civic Religion with Hierarchy and none of this equality nonsense.Can‚Äôt see anything like that working in the West if not imposed by the sword (just as Christianity was in large measure).The issue with more intellectual religions is that they only appeal to intellectuals. The common people require ritual, talismans, comfort, hope. So despite the intellectual heights reached by the higher forms of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, etc‚Ä¶.when you get down to the common folk at the coal face dealing with the daily joys and miseries and tragedies of human life, it‚Äôs all superstition and ooga booga ‚Äî as much so as you‚Äôd find in a church full of ululating Pentecostals or Latin-gabbling Calabrian peasants of yore.The real problem is not what Joe Sixpack believes. Give him enough elite direction and he‚Äôll be just fine. The issue is enforcing a healthy conformity of public piety on ‚ÄòElites‚Äô and maintaining that over the course of generations. Islam has managed it, but at a cost we‚Äôre probably not willing to pay.

        For most of our evolutionary history, unknowns dominated the human condition and many of these unknowns could get you killed, which tends to eliminate your genes from the gene pool. We needed a means of minimizing the adverse effects of unknowns and the inculcation of wisdom proved quite beneficial. And the most effective way to inculcate wisdom proved to be via the notion of an all-knowing, all-powerful benevolent supernatural being who validated this wisdom using both positive and negative reinforcement.

            The point of the Enlightenment was to make the icky problem of which religion is the true religion go away, by introducing a secular religion instead. Main problem is that the secular religion proves to be even worse.

        I never paid much attention to the new atheists. As our said, you cannot prove a negative. Additionally, most of these new atheists were leftists and became increasingly authoritarian over time. I think it was Sam Harris who said people refusing the covid-19 shots should be put in camps. Atheism is indeed an irrational position because it cannot be proven. One can only be agnostic.But I disagree on the morality. If you cannot prove either the existence or non-existence of a god or supernatural, there is little sense in basing a concept of morality on such. You have to come up with a standard of morality that is NOT rooted in any concept of supernatural that allows for people to get along with each other. Game theory alone suggests that morality is purely transactional. A person who treats others well and with respect is a moral person. A person who victimizes others is an immoral person. This standard of morality works perfectly fine for me. It allows me to pursue the things I want independent of others (such as biotechnological life extension) providing I do not cause harm to others. I see no reason for any other concept of morality, nor do I recognize such.The two fundamental values I believe in are liberty and productive accomplishment. Most organized religious have a track record of impeding both of these values above and beyond what is necessary to curb predatory or anti-social behavior. I see no reason to accept this.

            One problem with your conception of morality is that it cannot encompass all of humanity. What constitutes treating others ‚Äúwell‚Äù varies tremendously from one culture to the next. And indeed, some peoples would argue that what is best for the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù is prime, and that treating individuals ‚Äúwell‚Äù is secondary. In other words, you sometimes have to treat some people badly in order to defend the people as a whole.

            ‚ÄúA person who treats others well and with respect is a moral person. A person who victimizes others is an immoral person.‚ÄùNot to belabor a well thought out comment, but ‚Äúwho says‚Äù, *is*, the issue here.The adage ‚Äúhe who does not cheat, steals from his family‚Äù is commonly attributed to the French author Honor√© de Balzac.

                That‚Äôs a thought provoking quote, about he who does not cheat steals from his family. The implication is that one has a family and that the family is one‚Äôs first duty, or at least very high in the hierarchy of what one owes duty to. So what then in clown world, where families are less present, individuals more atomized. Is cheating still moral, in the family‚Äôs absence? If I do not cheat, I am cheating myself?

This seems to me a variant of the God-of-the-gaps argument, that if science can‚Äôt explain life, the universe and everything, it must mean talking snakes, angry volcano gods and a Mormon theme park in the sky.

The double-slit experiment is no more mysterious than the notion that there‚Äôs an invisible rubber band pulling the planets towards each other.Again: just because science can‚Äôt explain something doesn‚Äôt mean that God is the answer.(Also, I have a comment in mod limbo at the moment, asking you to remind me what logically unassailable argument against atheism you‚Äôve proffered me in the past.)

                                You‚Äôre looking at the wrong end of physics, the methods. In results and even more in implications modern and classical could hardly be more different than they are. As I‚Äôve said elsewhere both quantum mechanics and relativity become inconsistent if you assume just one reality of three space dimensions and one of time. So there are probably many. I understand that string theory says so but I didn‚Äôt like abstract algebra in college so, unlike with QM and relativity I don‚Äôt really understand string theory.You propose something.√∏ indeed, that there is no God. You may not say it but that is what you believe. You believe that because the universe is just a very very big space. I know you believe that because I could see in the simulation discussion above that you had trouble grasping the concept of one reality inside another. Admittedly this is abstract. One does not exactly need to wonder about this to buy a pint of milk.But if we assume more than o e reality and we probably have to to make physics consistent, it becomes more likely that there are infinitely many (of high cardinality) than that there are a specific natural number, for reasons I won‚Äôt derive here.So you are now left claiming that there are no gods in an infinite number of universes, only one of which you have access to a very small domain of. That breaks the scale of intellectual hubris.I could have been faster; just noting that once you were open to this being a simulation, whoever is running it, is god relative to you. Maybe you just dont like the word God??

And the lesser one is growing.The simulation question does not ontological difference because the proposed simulation is our reality. So from our pov it is reality. It might not be from outside. Hence these are not identical realities. Like I said you‚Äôre a Newtonian. We know this is wrong. Reality depends on point of view. So you didn‚Äôt understand it

                                            So why would you believe none of them contain what you would consider a God?Because ‚ÄúGod‚Äù by definition is a supernatural being, something that transcends physical reality. An electron is not. You seem to argue that God is just a natural phenomenon we haven‚Äôt discovered yet, thereby changing the definition God inThat is the bailey-level of your argument and clearly formatted for discussions with atheists rather that with fellow believers. Because the God-of-the-multiverses is not what actual Christians believe. Christians believe in quite specific divine characteristics ‚Äì in the case of Denmark, those in the Augsburg Confession.To be a Christian, it‚Äôs not enough to just believe that ‚Äúyeah, deep inside string theory, there‚Äôs a theoretical space where something inexplicably may exist and blablabla‚Ä¶‚ÄùNo, to be Christian you have to confess to the motte-argument in order to make God more than just a philosophical plaything for bored sophists like ourselves: the Trinity, the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, original sin, salvation by crucifixion and so forth.

                                                Of course something that is defined not to exist does not. Which is implied by ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù.But your definition of God, which requires him not to exist to be God is not universal (I‚Äôm reminded of Descartes:‚Äù I think, therefore I am. Therefore I cannot be God‚Äù lol) Suppose this world were a simulation. Then whoever is running it, has most of the characteristics of a god from our pov. He could reverse gravity if he wanted to, turn Michelle Obama into a woman and other ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù things.I‚Äôm not discussing the Christian image of God. I‚Äôm indeed trying to speculate on what what we know of reality implies about the boundaries of this reality. If there are other realities and a sentient being can move between them, he transcends our reality. That does not imply he transcends his own. A God to us ia probably not a god ro himself. It‚Äôs relativity to me. You‚Äôre talking about the Bible üòèAnyway we‚Äôre not going to agree here

        The problem with Christianity is that it is untrue. Indeed, it is palpably untrue, as should be obvious to any reasonably intelligent child who actually cares to think about it. For example, the Bible is full of gross contradictions, as documented in a series of books by Bart Ehrmann and, 300 years earlier, by Jean Meslier. It certainly makes a hash of elementary physics, as demonstrated by the recent efforts of Christian apologists to ‚Äúretranslate‚Äù the Greek word for firmament as ‚Äúsky,‚Äù and its embarrassing difficulties with evolution by natural selection. It can certainly serve as a basis for morality, but because it is untrue, that often leads to morality inversions. In other words, it results in a morality that often has outcomes that are the opposite of the reasons morality exists to begin with.Why does morality exist? The Blank Slaters claimed that it was all learned, but as an avowed opponent of the Blank Slate dogmas, you know that‚Äôs wrong. In fact, it exists because of behavioral dispositions that evolved, and they evolved because they happened to promote the survival and reproduction of the individuals who carried the relevant genes. The many celibate nuns and priests who lived spotlessly moral lives according to Christian morality were not notably successful at passing on the only part of themselves that was really potentially immortal ‚Äì their genes. They were biological dead ends. That‚Äôs what I mean by a morality inversion.Obviously, to get morality right, we first need to gain a little self-understanding. Once we accept the fact that we are evolved life forms, it becomes perfectly obvious why morality exists, and why we so firmly believe that our idiosyncratic collections of oughts and ought nots are really true, even though they are actually entirely subjective. Darwin didn‚Äôt exactly spoon feed it to us, but he explained it well enough in Chapter IV of his ‚ÄúThe Descent of Man.‚Äù His thoughts on the subject were elaborated by Edvard Westermarck in 1906 in his ‚ÄúThe Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas.‚ÄùHarris made the gross error of claiming that morality is objective, but, of course, he could never come up with any rational basis for this claim. When seriously challenged, he would always fall back on retorts such as, ‚ÄúWhat, do you really mean that torturing infants isn‚Äôt evil?!‚Äù In fact, it is not objectively evil, but that hardly means that it need be permissible. That‚Äôs where it seems to me our host gets it wrong. When you say that, if there is no objective basis for morality than everything is permitted, you are really stating an ought. You are making a category error. If morality is subjective, then there is no basis for the claim that a particular thing is permitted, nor is there a basis for the claim that it is not permitted. These are decisions we humans have always made for ourselves. There was no objective basis for these decisions but we ‚Äúfelt in our bones,‚Äù or, more accurately our genes, that our oughts and ought nots were ‚Äúreally true,‚Äù so we invented reasons why, such as our menagerie of religions.Christianity certainly has no monopoly on morality inversions. The Woke Left stumbles into them constantly in the process of concocting new ‚Äúmoral laws‚Äù for us on almost a daily basis. We could avoid these absurdities by understanding why morality exists to begin with, realizing that it is indispensable in human societies, and constructing a morality that most of us can accept with a minimum of inconvenience. There is no reason at all why such moral laws would need some other-worldly basis. Indeed, in reality they have never had one. There is also no reason at all why societies could not punish violations of the moral law as severely as they pleased. That is how morality has always worked. I merely suggest putting it on a rational basis for a change.

            The issue is that you can‚Äôt get to the Rational Basis can you. I mean, that‚Äôs what our current social order is based on.  How‚Äôs that working out?I would also note that no matter how natural, excellent and beautiful the ancient Greeks were, they were destroyed. Perhaps something more enduring is a sounder foundation for Life?
The most rationalist argument for Christianity can be found in the works of Rene Girard.Try it.

                    The problem of human community is rivalry and violence- mimetic desire; we tend to want what other have and imitate others as well; this striving creates rivalry in the community that historically, anthropologically, has been resolved through human sacrifice, either ritualistically in a controlled manner or chaotically in civil strife or war.  Our literature testifies to the internal realty of memetic desire while our histories testify to its effects.Christianity is unique in World History because alone among the Worlds cultural, religious and ideological systems it focuses human memetics on Christ, who unlike other idealized objects is the One Other that does not project back or inflict rivalry upon the believer or the community. Christ chose ‚Äúdeath‚Äù over rivalry and as such neutralized the process and conquered the blood stained tide of human existence.  You may not believe in Christ but his effect is manifest Worldwide.Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World is a good starting point.I expect a hostile comment. That‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm just throwing seeds.
