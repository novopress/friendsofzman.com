        It is a funny story, with lots of teaching moments. But even prisons have guards who inmates refer to as “angels” because they will not yield to the prison culture. There are no angels at a school like this.My sister was a master teacher, but moved about the country with her Army husband. Their last stop was in Fayettville, NC. She took a position, for greater pay, at an all black elementary school, which hired her in an attempt to bring them up from a rating that would lose their federal money train. She did, single-handedly. With one (of two) third grade class, one of twelve classes in the school. The other teachers hated her. No one sat with her at lunch for three years. She lasted the three because her students loved her, but left for half the money at a private school.It’s so bad out there, with retarded illiterates teaching future inmates and single mothers, that ordinary people with no experience around it simply don’t grasp the reality of it when they are told.

        “an allegation he marched sixth-graders up and down a set of stairs for more than five minutes as a means of discipline”
Perhaps, just perhaps, this bunch of kids deserved some discipline and in the great scheme of things it is hardly the most onerous punishment. But on the other hand, no one else is going to discipline them so why bother?

        Mr. Shadow is a loser fool and deserves his fate. Any person with self respect and a modicum of professional excellence would have left an environment so evidently wretched after his first year. But Mr. Shadow apparently planned to make it a career there when there are teacher shortages around much of the country.  We are left to assume that he knows he does not have the stuff to better himself. I’m sure I agree.

            Yeah, the Shadow strikes me as a loser who most likely deserves his fate. Since the only way you can get fired from the NYC public schools is to commit a felony (and even then you have to be convicted and sent away in order to be fired), I suspect he fits right in with the rest of them. But, it is still a funny story.

        The boycott and rejection of the Negro culture has begun in earnest in White America.
Whether Mr. Shadow wins or not doesn’t matter. He’s taking a stand in public, others will follow.
His public action represents deep and unforgiving resistance that has been brewing for quite some time.
Times have already changed, Negroes and their race hustlers will be the last to know and the first to fall.
