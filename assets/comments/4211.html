        Galileo got in trouble chiefly because he was an ass hole.  He managed to:1)  Insult and ridicule the Pope as a simpleton – the same Pope who had been his chief advocate and primary financier of his studies and who, by the way, at the time was also a Medieval prince.  It was always bad form to insult a Prince at the time, particularly if you were living in their kingdom2) Piss off the Jesuits, who he called idiots after they had tracked the plot of a comet and announced that the comet traveled in an elliptical orbit around the sun – Galileo was so enamored with orbits being circular that he would publicly insult anyone who suggested otherwise3) Suggest – probably by accident and without thinking, in the same document that he ridiculed the Pope – that if someone’s scientific theories did not agree with scripture, then the individual should ignore scripture, or at least interpret it their own way.  He did this at a particularly violent time of the Reformation, right around the time of the Peasant Revolt in Germany I think, where about 50,000 folks had just been massacred by German princes at the behest of Luther, because they were following an interpretation of scripture different than his. You might say that this sort of violence and mass murder made the subject of private scriptural interpretation at the time sort of, you know, touchy…

Exactly. I was trying to be polite, but yeah, Galileo was an asshole.

        Not sure that Newton or Einstein would pass the asshole test either. But yeah, he stuck it in the eye of his benefactor. Too bad we don’t have more of that today.
