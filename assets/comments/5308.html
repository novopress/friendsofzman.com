        Not having paid much attention to it when I was young, I’ve learned a good bit about baseball from George Will. But, not much else. Being an octogenarian, most of his political stuff I’ve seen before.

        This significant issue aside, and I guess a few others, George Will is a net plus. More often than not, he’s making smart arguments that reach the unconverted, nudging readers to the right. Don’t know what that’s worth, but it’s worth something.

        A conservative understands this.
A Christian understands this. A Jew understands this. A medieval humanist understands this. Moderns cannot understand this. So much has been lost, not be recovered in my lifetime.

        “A conservative understands this. George Will does not.”
Ouch! That is going to leave a mark! But it made me smile.
Chronic pain is a bitch but life is still pretty good given the old axiom “better living through chemistry”. When even that fails well then I imagine I will already be dead.

        Strangely, George Will was not the image that popped into my head upon reading the headline.

        George Will needs a long break from himself, and from DC.
Some day when the mood strikes me I’ll write a book–Suicide for Dummies. I might stretch it out to two pages.
If you are looking for a Doctor to kill you, you are seeking something more than suicide. You are seeking approval and an accomplice.

        “In almost all cases, suicide attempts are a symptom of serious psychological problems.”OK. I’ll bite. Let’s say you’re caught in a bad situation, forced to live in what is universally perceived as horrible state. If you don’t like it, are you depressed, or a realist?To whom do you owe the effort to keep fighting?

        I had a friend that took her own life. She had Crohn’s disease and was a recovering alcoholic. She worked with the Hemlock Society, which suggests a combination of alcohol and certain prescription pills. She always joked that it had better work, or she’d blow her recovery anniversary. She said when she reached the point that she could no longer do the things she loved, she’d kill herself. And the doctor did give her the prescription pills. She had them for several years before she reached the point she was ready to use them and she was successful. I can support someone in that situation and I can have some sympathy for an older married couple, where one takes the life of a failing spouse. That one is one that we just can’t legalize. I do think that someone wanting end of life help has to take the responsibility for carrying it out in their own hands, as my friend did. And I am strongly against the insanity of letting children decide that they want to die.
