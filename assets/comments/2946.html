        I would favor paying teachers 100k, or more. This is what I told a group of picketing teachers (for a ballot proposition involved in raising teachers salaries) in front of my daughters school when I dropped her off one day. Smiles ended when I also said that of course it would be unfair to the students to  retain the quality of teachers that worked for a fraction of that money. Party over.
