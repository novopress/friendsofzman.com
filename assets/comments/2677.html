        For the most part, I’ve been a law abiding person. But I’ve seen how the law has jacked around my stepson, for petty stuff. Yes, he had a lead foot and yes, he didn’t pay his fines. There are plenty of things that he did wrong. The thing is, if he had well to do parents, he could have paid the fines and never done jail time.The other interesting thing to me is our property caretaker. Again, he did some stupid stuff. He’s been required to register as a sex offender for a misdemeanor he did over 20 years ago. (He touched a 17 year old girl’s breast. She was fully clothed. He did no jail time. If he had money, the prosecutor of that case would have it expunged.) I’ve actually spent some time visiting this guy while he was in jail. They had a trumped up charge that they used to threaten him with 4 years in jail. After two years, they basically dropped it. And I saw a lot of parents, dealing with their kids for similar foolishness.We have local police forces that think of citizens as the enemy. We have courts that rubber stamp whatever the cops say. We have too damn many laws on the books, making it easy to turn anyone into a criminal. We put too many poor people in jail for trivial offenses, and do not allow them to work off the fines. We turn a blind eye to illegals driving with no license, and take away licenses from citizens for minor offenses.I don’t have an answer for this, but anyone that trusts their police department should take a look at the local jail roster and see why those folks are in jail. We had one guy in jail for two months for illegally sleeping in the park.

        But…but…if all LE was required to use ONLY so-called “smart” guns, the whole “accountability” thing could be easilyverified, for about ten minutes.Kinda’ like mandated (ie)IRS “documentation” of their “official” activity.
