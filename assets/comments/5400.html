        Oh, great. Now I’ve got that goofy Peter, Paul &amp; Mary song in my head!If Jackie Paper could, like St. Paul (1 Cor. 13:11), “…put away childish things”, why did the Baby Boomers have to drag out junk like “Puff the Magic Dragon” at every opportunity, for decades on end, so that those of us born well after the song’s heyday were subjected to it?After all, the GI generation did not insist that all future generations commit theoeuvreof Spike Jones to memory, or have the very young me sing “Yes, We Have No Bananas” in nursery school.

        I think we have  had our experience with a “magic negro.”  Time to go  back to the PPP,  and no, we don’t need a “historic”  vagina right now,  maybe later but not now.

        Everyone is a bigot. It is a natural order of race, culture, age, sex, class etc. Its part of being human. There is no denying it exists and no denying it from being the truth. What’s the issue?What’s so difficult about that?But being a bigotry bigot, that’s what makes bigotry a serious problem. Its a rainbow of insanity. Elevating the bigotry of bigots as intellectual superiority above the natural order of bigotry is insanity of contradictions.What a tool bigotry of bigots is. Its the statists fulcrum. The lever of social engineering. Talk about divide and conquer.  Its like eating the seed corn of culture.

        “By now someone would have come forward if Carson had a dark side”
His outside is pretty dark.

        Carson is just a place holder until Mr. Right comes along.

        “By now someone would have come forward if Carson had a dark side or a bunch of skeletons in his closet.”
I wonder about this.  Right now Carson’s purpose is to give the rubes and vulgarians a non-Trump outlet for their anger that is acceptable to the Establishment.  If his involvement were somehow to drive Trump out of the race then his usefulness to  ¡Yeb! will have ended.  I suspect at that point skeletons will come home to roost and Carson will be summarily Herman Cain-ed.

            No doubt. The chattering skulls know what they know and they can’t imagine anyone but a dreary pol from the party machines. Right now they will back anyone not named Trump, but once it is safe they will rally to one of the dishrags.
