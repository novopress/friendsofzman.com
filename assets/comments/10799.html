        Fine show. Very useful for when I am occupied at something where I can‚Äôt read, which is often. You will go to hell for the  artful dismissal of female writers. Hope to see you there.

        Zman ‚Äì I heard your fellow Baltimore resident James LeFond on 2Kevins‚Äô podcast a couple weeks ago. (http://2kevins.com/archives/1160)  Would love to hear you interview him regarding life on those troubled streets.

                Oh it gets worse:https://www.ericpetersautos.com/2017/06/05/theocracy-advances-utah-soon-near/He‚Äôs complaining about a push to lower the legal blood alcohol limit from .08 to .05 (the standard in Canada and most other first-world countries).Read through it, it comes off as an excessively wordy version of the old (and stupid) ‚ÄùI can drive better drunk than most people can sober!‚Äù.I think he should be allowed to drink and drive just as much as his heart desires‚Ä¶But only within the city limits of Detroit.

            I came here to suggest the exact same thing. Given that I am a fan of both of you, I would love to hear a wide ranging discussion between the two of you on various topics. You both have very strong personalities, and in some cases very divergent opinions and a discussion between the highly civilised Z-Man and the self proclaimed Barbarian Lafond would be awesome.

        very good episode. just one minor point ‚Äì the EU is actually very effective when it comes to the big things like trade deals bcs most of the birocratic talent is there.in reality most of the things that affect businesses and individuals (like ISO standards) are done by independent or semi independent organizations that are headquartered in places like Geneva. EU is just a middle man in many cases. what is annoying people is the euro communist stuff similar to what SJW are doing in US. it hasn‚Äôt led to a widespread revolt cause a lot of people in the western europe actually like those things and we in the east like their money so we find ourselves at a standstill.

        Great job. Nice to receive a more long-form Z-man. The audio is very clear and the level of each section is very consistent; slight level differences from one section to the next but no big deal.
Thanks for making it available on youtube; too bad that the process of converting it is a pain.

        Good podcast, but the correct pronunciation of John‚Äôs name, strange as it sounds, is ‚ÄúDarby-Sure.‚Äù  I like your ‚Äúartillery segue‚Äù sound more than his little electric metronome click.Re: Kathy Shaidle, there are some people I read on all subjects (like Steve Sailer or you) and then there are some people who are only good for specific things. I read Kathy for her knowledge of feminism‚Äôs treachery and skip her otherwise.Re: the media just going full retard/fake, someone in Russia said that he read Pravda every day, because when it became total lies, you could read a story, reverse its assertions, and arrive at the truth. That‚Äôs the utility of something like ‚ÄúThe New York Times‚Äù at this point. If they have an article headlined, ‚ÄúDonald Trump tells more lies‚Äù I know I‚Äôm about to read some lies from ‚ÄúThe Times‚Äù about Trump.

        Maybe the alt right could watch euro basket!
Notice something about the players?
Serbia v Spain ‚Äì Game Highlights ‚Äì Group A ‚Äì 2014
Spain v Serbia ‚Äì Group B ‚Äì Game Highlights ‚Äì EuroBasket 2015
I choose Spain on purpose because hearing Spanish names in basketball must trigger something in Americans, ‚ÄúFernandez jump shot‚Äù means something totally different in down town Los Angeles than in Europe. üôÇ

        Thought I would chip in with some encouragement a few days late. I will definitely continue listening in the future. It would be nice if you were able to do a show with the TDS guys and maybe give them some hints on how going full nazi  is not going to win the masses.

        I‚Äôve really enjoyed both podcasts. My hearing must not be as acute as some others as everything sounds good to me.
As for pen names; I believe leftists/their allies seek to eradicate pen-names as its so much easier to attack the person on the right ad hominem, than seek to defend the arguments on the left which are absurd.

        I enjoyed your second Cast. You are getting better at the sound quality aspect and seem more comfortable.I listen to podcasts for content. You are a first rate mind with intelligent things, useful things to say.  As long as the sound quality is adequate to hear the mind behind it I‚Äôm good. Kinda like a Live album versus a studio album. Different experiences. Live ‚Äòquality‚Äô of the performance was usually weaker but it was perhaps more memorable. Energy. Passion. Vibe.I mean I still laugh at the stoner yelling out ‚ÄúFreeeeeeeeee Bird‚Äù from the audience on Lynyrd Skynyrd Live from the 70‚Äôs.

        Hey Z-Man another great show, hard to believe it‚Äôs only your 2nd podcast.  Your riff on brisket was on point‚ÄìI‚Äôve had the non-BBQ version of Jewish brisket at friends houses (in Texas no less) many times.One more techy thing‚Äìyou are saturating your mic‚Äìjust turn down the recording volume so that the recording ‚Äúmeter‚Äù never gets close to zero. You should be able to adjust the recording volume by moving the slider next to the mic input icon. (Looks like that defaults to max gain in Audacity, not a good thing.)When I looked at the waveform of your MP3 file the saturation was obvious‚Äìit was a solid blue bar from -1.0 to +1.0.  Should have a lot of white space between 0.5 and the limit.Hope this helps.  Looking forward to your next show!

        Z, you‚Äôre great and all, but you seem to have completely misunderstood the ‚Äúrobot apocalypse‚Äù. The robots don‚Äôt have to be conscious AIs to take your job, and that‚Äôs the problem we‚Äôre going to be facing before very long. There simply won‚Äôt be enough jobs for everyone who wishes to work, and that imbalance will grow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶until there are no more jobs.
