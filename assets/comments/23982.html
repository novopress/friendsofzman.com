        I‚Äôd wager Z is correct about another ‚Äúlong, hot summer‚Äù (e.g. violence). Here‚Äôs a news item saying Baltimorgue murders already are ahead of 2020‚Äôs rate. ‚ÄúUnofficial‚Äù summer only began just over a week ago. Schools don‚Äôt even let out for a few more weeks.https://www.zerohedge.com/political/baltimore-city-homicide-rate-surpasses-2020-rates-amid-rash-gun-violencePredicting the economic future is a mug‚Äôs game too, and no better place to get mugged than the stock market (beyond the literal mugging on a Baltimore street, I suppose.) I‚Äôm expecting ‚Äî more or less ‚Äî the Fed to raise (or the market to force the Fed) to raise interest rates sometime this summer and that will have various and sundry effects on the market and the economy, likely none of them good, unless you had a pile of cash waiting for things to get cheaper üòÄA non-election year makes the most sense, to the extent the planners can plan these things, to inflict necessary (?) economic pain, with hopes that it‚Äôll be alleviated by the time the mid-term elections roll around, a year and a half away.

        I‚Äôve pushed the idea to civnats that the constitution has become effectively useless because the progressives have figured out easy workarounds by emphasizing the letter of the law rather than the spirit. You can ban conservative speech by working with ‚Äúprivate companies like google or bookpublishers. They‚Äôre looking to contract a private company to monitor the internet activity of conservatives. They have companies enforce covid passport systems to get their jabs. The republicans then shuffle their feet and say ‚Äúoh well‚Äù because they don‚Äôt want to regulate private companies. Many civnats are starting to wake up and acknowledge these points when I bring them up.

        Vaxpartheid ‚Äì Day 2:So, it turns out I have two jab jockeys in my immediate vicinity.Jab jockey #1 is an early 50s male of Italian extraction. Appears 5 to 7 years older than his actual age. Seems to get moderate exercise and sunshine via regular golf so he‚Äôs in okay shape. Coughs and wheezes quite a bit throughout the day. Also blows huge boogers from his nose two or three times a day.Jab jockey #2 is a mid-to-late 50s YT male. Also appears 5 to 7 years older than his actual age. Is quite portly and has a pronounced limp. Odd worldview that is on one hand hippie/hackerish yet he‚Äôs all about the USG. I get along with him and don‚Äôt question his claims about hacking Chicoms from the library or calling up people at Langley. You never know.I should probably start a blog on this topic. Frankly, after almost 20 years of beating my head against the wall trying to convince myself I‚Äôm a corporate guy, I‚Äôve grown a bit lazy. Playing options footsie with the orange juice gang is still going well, so why stress?

        ‚ÄúThis is shaping up to be one of those unforced regime mistakes that seem to characterize every revolution. The abortion case in particular is the one that could radicalize a lot of civic nationalists. Christian conservatives are already on the edge, given the overtly anti-Christian pogroms run by the ruling class. If the court finks on them in the fall, it could be the last straw. They will conclude that there is no path forward in conventional politics and begin to organize outside of the system.‚ÄùI don‚Äôt think they will do much of anything, frankly. Pray and vote harder, maybe. The guns ruling will be status quo ante, largely because that would explode in some pockets, and could escalate.The spark will be a financial crisis, and a state with the jack and courage to build its own weapons program independent of the feds.

        Here‚Äôs a great example of civnats on the road to nowhere:
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/06/02/the-american-west-is-shifting-to-the-left/
So, that bunch works on ideas and policies, but would never stoop so low as to get people into office.
Uh guys, assuming you plan to work within the system, how do you think policies get implemented?

        here‚Äôs a question ‚Äì how do the dems EVER get a rubber-stamp majority without doing Ipatiev House stuff. The two oldest cons are 71 and 73. They can win the presidency two or three times in a row but by then they could be down to only 40 senate seats. So they would have to then have two terms of R presidencies so they can get the senate back and then (if everyone is on board) ‚Äì pack the court. Guys like @davidshor and @ronbrownstein have been sounding the alarm on this.

            Seems like the Supreme Court case on abortion is a win, no matter the verdict/decision.  Fail to restrict/limit abortion to a State decision, the religious right is alienated finally from the political process.  Curtail Fed abortion over-reach and the Court will surely be ‚Äúpacked‚Äù, thereby lifting the mask on the facade of ‚Äúrule by law‚Äù.  I can‚Äôt wait. üòâ

        Z: ‚ÄòEven if the revolution takes a holiday this summer‚Äô‚Ä¶it‚Äôll still be on your bagel.I had a lox bagel delivered yesterday because I grew up surrounded by Jews so I love delis and bagels.  Some of the bagel chips that came with it were rainbow-colored.   I ate them.  There‚Äôs no escape.Speaking of gays.  When I was a kid I went to Kmart with my dad.  He went his way and I went to the record section.  As I‚Äôm flipping through the albums, this guy who‚Äôd been browsing nearby walks up to me and holds up two Richard Simmons‚Äô albums with Simmons in short-shorts, and asks ‚Äúwhich one do you think I should get?‚Äù

        Wait a minute‚Ä¶, can someone explain what the rationale is, from our side, for wanting to restrict abortion? Responsible people (you know who I mean) mostly limit their reproduction using birth control, so they would not be affected. The people affected would mostly be the irresponsible people, who would lose an option that currently allows them a late recovery from their own mistakes. WHY WOULD WE WANT TO DO THAT?

            One case I saw made that I‚Äôm still chewing over is that abortion allows (our) women to act in the most reckless, antisocial manner, exactly what a society doesnotwant from their women.  The case further pointed out that we‚Äôre going to have to figure out how to survive the ‚Äúbrown wave‚Äù regardless and that it would have been better to not degrade our own women in an effort to stave it off.

            The abortion debate is good to keep around to throw in Lefty‚Äôs face to show what selfish monsters they are.  I personally hope nothing much is done about the subject.  Most people are sad and life is depressing so the little fetuses are probably better off not being birthed into this world.

            The brutal truth of the matter is that abortion *will never be prohibited*.  There were, I‚Äôve read,  6 States at the time of Roe vs Wade at allowed for abortion above and beyond the usual rape, incest, life of mother allowances.  The Supremes at best will toss the abortion issue back into the State‚Äôs bailiwick.  That will probably mean more than half the country will still allow abortion in some meaningful way for getting rid of  unwanted ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù.  Abortion will be only a bus ticket away.

            I don‚Äôt want to live in a society that kills babies or pretends life starts outside the womb. Sterilizing undesirables would be preferable. Not that I‚Äôm for that either, but at least they‚Äôve proven they don‚Äôt belong in the gene pool.  Abortion is a monstrous thing.

            I‚Äôm late to the party on this Z man post, but I second the anti-feminist logic about abortion.Believe it or not, this is one of the very few issues that unite white men and women of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù values and persuasions. Most married white women that I know who are mothers are pro-life. It is only the very worst whores and uppity social and economic status climbers who are pro-choice. It doesn‚Äôt matter that they inadvertently are in favor of policies that keep the black population from exploding. I will be straight with you. I hate these women more than I dislike blacks. I hate their selfishness. I hate their self serving ideas. I hate their alienating behaviors. I don‚Äôt hate women. But I hate hate hate leftist white women, because they are everything women shouldn‚Äôt be.I am one who believes that disharmony between white men and women is a much more destructive issue than proximity to blacks. And as long as our women are selfish whores, there isn‚Äôt much left to fight for anyway.

        What Revolution?Who? What?There is absolutely no group capable of revolt , never mind Revolution .  We in the service study these matters, as do those who read history.   The makings of Revolution require organization to rival the State, and nothing exists.  Should anyone suggest organizing they are shouted down as Feds, esp in the DR, especially here.   Wishing and doing are worlds apart.You are dreaming, daydreaming.No Revolution including yes the French ever happened without organizing first, usually for decades.If I were to pitch it I‚Äôd make clear we guarantee nothing except suffering, prison, death.    Guaranteed.The price of risk avoidance is failure.And no, no one else does this for you, certainly not me.The regime is here to stay.  Believe it.Its legitimacy grows with every day it sits in DC, put there by Fraud and minute force.  Minute.If it was replaced it would probably be worse, and far more woke and aggressive in repression than the Fat Bitch in HR.   Biden replaced by Kamala and BLM getting badges.Ain‚Äôt happening.People had their fun calling everyone a Fed, it worked.   Zero capacity to do anything but grumble, and they‚Äôll take that away at leisure.Makes one wonder who really was working for the Feds, certainly dissing down everyone serves the Feds interests.   Hmm?

            True but for different reasons.  The revolution already happened.  It happened years ago.  The Rainbow flags and BLM flags on all the embassies are symbols of a completely captured society.  The right is by its nature counter-revolutionary.  A counter revolution at this point is building entirely separate systems.  But doing this will be an incredibly slow and stunted process until after the financial crisis that will end in state solvency issues.  The financial crisis will split the country into far left and far right within a few years.  Nothing like today, with is already much more bifurcated than 20 years ago.  The actual paradigm will shift.  We haven‚Äôt had a paradigm shift in our lifetimes and its due.

It was like the ‚Äúcoup‚Äù against Trump. The coup happened a long time before he came on the scene.
A currency crisis, and perhaps a state starting its own weapons system, will be the spark. And the former, and probably the latter, are coming fast.

                JR Wirth I‚Äôm trying hard to be respectful and polite, but please notice something in your point above:  all of it happens due to impersonal forces like inflation, paradigm shift‚Ä¶This is magical thinking.Nothing magical about the Left on the other hand, they just put the work in, and they run the risks of doing so.

                In agreement, and restating the obvious: in the USA and other nations, the social ‚Äì political ‚Äì legal ‚Äì economic changes have taken place over many decades and several lifetimes. Now, it is not clear (to me) how much of this was deliberate by organized factions, and how much simply by popular apathy or even approval (‚Äúfree stuff!‚Äù). My point is that the institutions were indeed marched through, even if at half-step march, and by and large, unopposed by and even with approval by the prior occupants.I have no opinion about how far these changes will go. I do concur, also, that revolutions worthy of the name (bloody or not) typically don‚Äôt happen unless a severe crisis presents itself. Bad economies are often a feature of those. Even absent an organized opposition, reality presents insuperable limits to how absurd a regime can go, before it would simply collapse on its own, even without anyone putting a knife in anyone‚Äôs back.

            You‚Äôre not thinking outside the box. You don‚Äôt fight a war with obsolete strategy &amp; tactics from the past, and similarly, you don‚Äôt attempt a revolution using the predictable methods of the past either. A new paradigm is necessary.The government produces nothing. It needs a productive population to generate wealth in order to feed the beast. Our society is now nearing a majority of parasites that live off of the productivity of others, and the ability to sustain the beast is becoming precarious.Now what if the productive element of society gets fed up with all of the bloodsucking and becomes de facto dissidents? And what if those dissidents decide to stop feeding the beast? Or perhaps, stop repairing and maintaining the beast? Or perhaps affirmatively help the beast to grind to a halt?No shots need be fired in anger or otherwise. And you don‚Äôt need an army either. We‚Äôve already seen what happens when an important fuel delivery pipeline shuts down. And a computer hack is not as powerful as maintenance that doesn‚Äôt get done. The former can be fixed quickly, the latter could take months.

                Now what if the productive element of society gets fed up with all of the bloodsucking and becomes de facto dissidents? And what if‚Ä¶Have you been studyingAtlas Shruggedagain? If so, now is a good time to notice that John Galt had a vested interest in destroying the power companies. He needed their distribution networks to make his generation gizmo into a practical option for supplying the masses with electricity. He did not need the power companies‚Äô expensive but obsolete generation equipment, their long-term depreciation schedules for that expensive equipment, their long-term supply contracts for fuels, or their timid aversion to revolutionary technology. The solution to his problem, therefore, involved moves to bankrupt the power companies, after which Johnny and his little crew (with guys such as the judge) could swoop in like vultures for the assets Galt needed.At the end of the story, the vulture phase of the plan is about to commence. Galt is at his gulch with Dagny (iirc) where he‚Äôs fantasizing about his return to the world which he has just turned upside down. There, lost in the ecstatic vision of becoming plutocratically wealthy, he waves his hand in the air in the pattern of $.That‚Äôs your revolutionary who preached all that stuff about producers resisting the moochers and looters. You should also notice that many of your ‚Äúdissident‚Äù producers in this world are themselves moochers and looters. They won‚Äôt be joining your revolution any time soon, for the beast is their patron.A good example of corrupt producers comes in the form of military contractors, even when they have civiliar divisions. Another example is the automobile industry (including suppliers). That‚Äôs an epic bloodsucker completely dependent upon government largess for roadbuilding. Without the vast network of multilane divided highways, the market for automobiles would be a small fraction of what it is today. The petroleum and refining industry provides another example of producers with a natural hostility to your revolution. They need the vast network of subsidized roads for the huge numbers of cars guzzling their products.I could go on here with examples like this, but I think I‚Äôve made my point. Your revolutionary zeal is driven by a masturbation fantasy in facts and logic do not matter..

                    Thanks for the stroll down memory lane. It‚Äôs been nearly a half century since I read any Rand (like most of my college age contemporaries), but Atlas Shrugged was not an inspiration for my comment. Rather, computer based simulation modeling of societal evolution has been ongoing for nearly 3 decades now and the current models are quite sophisticated and suitable for both prediction estimation and case study analysis. Big Brother uses these tools to aid in its indoctrination implementation, but they can also be used to evaluate optimized countermeasures.As to your specific criticism about the corruption of power players in industry, almost all of those guys have never picked up a wrench and wouldn‚Äôt be of any use sabotaging anything tangible. To do that, you need the grunts at the bottom of the pyramid with dirt under their fingernails. You know, the guys that nobody notices.

                    I get your point (?) about insiders perhaps rigging a system so that assets go on a ‚Äúfire sale‚Äù which they later scoop up.But you have Atlas Shrugged mostly wrong. There is absolutely NONE of such sabotage among Galt and his fellow strikers (the Producers.) Now it is true that some of them deliberately sabotage their businesses: D‚ÄôAnconia his copper mines, Wyatt his oil fields, etc. These Producers cede their properties to the Looters who are incapable of running them.You are correct that Galt could in theory profit by future use of the electrical infrastructure. But again, I think you are totally wrong, relative to the narrative of the novel. To the best of my knowledge, Galt never engages in any such shady business as you describe, much less in partnership with  the Looters. You ARE correct, to the extent that Galt is the lead saboteur (‚ÄúI will stop the motor of the world.‚Äù) But he does so by convincing the Producers, the ‚Äúmen of the mind‚Äù to ‚Äúgo on strike,‚Äù e.g. to go to ground and withdraw consent from the Looters.Of course Rand‚Äôs novel  is fantasy: the real world doesn‚Äôt work quite as neatly as she would have it be. There is an ideological chasm between her Producer and Looter. If only the real world were so clear-cut.

        It is instructive to note which demographic has the highest proportion of abortions. Here are numerous Handy Charts and Statistics:
http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/usa_abortion_by_race.html
Now, consider how much more vibrant we‚Äôd be without abortion, and whether it should merely be restricted for whites. After all you wouldn‚Äôt want vibrants to be denied their rights!

            Looks like they peaked around when I was born.  Hallmark should have a card, ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt abort me in the late 70‚Äôs to snort coke at a disco??? Thanks mom!‚Äù   She also gave up here career when all the career women Hillary Clintons of her time were telling her she was a fool and a throwback.  I truly won the lottery of life.

            The Bible Belt people might regret it if they get their way and do actually ban abortion.Becky‚Äôs mom got an IUD into her on her 16th birthday, and will make arrangements for an underground abortion in the unlikely case of an unplanned pregnancy, legal or not.L‚ÄôShaniqu‚Äôa is certainly *not* on birth control. She‚Äôll say ‚ÄúSheeit, but Day-kwan tell‚Äôd me he pullout how I be pregnant‚Äù and have the baby, if abortion is not legal. Repeat this process multiple times across her life.I‚Äôm not super opposed to abortion in general but I think it should really be restricted for the good of public morality‚Ä¶ in a 90% white, Christian, family values country. In a 3rd or 4th world shit hole‚Ä¶ well might be best to keep it legal for certain reasons and look the other way. Just saying.

                This is all true.  Even in the 50‚Äôs you had the white girl in the poodle skirt getting the business card of a doctor who would ‚Äúdiscreetly take care of it.‚Äù  Abortion was legalized because back in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs they would watch demographic figures like hawks, and were trying to figure a way out of the negro unwanted birth situation.  I‚Äôm sure Reagan was thinking of this when he signed the CA bill, which was up there with NY at the time.  Not to mention hippie daughters coming home knocked up by some degenerate.  Yet another example where their precious Reagan was a fraud.

            I‚Äôd want to see some graphs of black population growth before and after various interventions like birth control, abortion, the civil rights movement, the welfare state, etc.
Even black people react to incentives and disincentives. It is certain that not all the abortions would turn into live births if abortion were banned. The key would be to figure out exactly what the conversion rate would be, and what other incentives were influencing it.

            Yep.  Sad but true.  We‚Äôll pay for this vibrant crew one way or the other.  Things really haven‚Äôt changed since Margaret Sanger‚Äôs day.  Or my day, either, back in the 60s when my contemporaries were getting ‚Äúillegal‚Äù abortions and then marrying multiple times but not actually procreating.  Lots of them becoming Managing Partners of big law firms but NOT having babies.  Their genes ‚Äî and their husbands‚Äô ‚Äî have hit a wall.  The ‚Äúwrong‚Äù folks are the ones having offspring.

        We are about 53/54 weeks away from these decisions being handed down, however. They will be argued in the fall, but the court won‚Äôt issue rulings until mid-June of 2022. By then, who knows what this country will look like, or even the composition of the Court?Mutatis mutandis, the point stands that this so-called ‚Äúconservative‚Äù court will almost certainly rule against Mississippi‚Äôs abortion law. I am a pro-lifer but long ago left behind the ‚Äúmovement‚Äù for its decades-long naivete and allegiance to the regime. A 2022 decision re-affirming Roe and Casey should be the final reveal to pro-lifers that they have lost, permanently, and that other alternatives to political life in the US must now be considered.

        As I recall, John Robert‚Äôs name was on Epstein‚Äôs flight manifest.  That was swept under the rug pretty quickly.  We heard nothing about it.  It makes perfect sense too.  I always found something wrong with Roberts as soon as ass clown W.  rolled him out.  It‚Äôs hard to believe it was 20 years ago.  But I distinctly remember his kids, dressed in some 1920‚Äôs outfits, basically like a child‚Äôs suit in short pants, and thought it was so odd and inside the beltway.  Even in my early 20‚Äôs I knew something was off with that.  Roberts has a face of pure, distilled, D.C. smugness.  I never trusted him out the gate, and sure enough he‚Äôs been a disappointment all along, appointed by the most disappointing and retarded of Presidents.  Something about Roberts whispers in my ear ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a pervert of some kind.‚ÄùAs a side note Scalia had no business on that Texas ranch where he died as the owners were connected to a future case he was going to decide.  And supposedly there were rumors about the place flying in hookers on private jets.  Scalia had some great decisions, but on anything related to money he could be counted on to decide with Conservative Inc.  He nearly always sided with government power when a dollar bill was dragged through his chambers.I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs been a ‚Äúconservative majority‚Äù on that court since the 19th Century.

            John Roberts is a very common name and the flight in question left from Teterboro on a day the Supreme Court was in session and hearing arguments.  It is not possible it is the Supreme Court Justice.My thought when I heard people throwing this around was that the John Roberts on the Epstein flight was most likely the CEO of J.B Hunt.

                    If there were any journalists inclined to check on that, and there aren‚Äôt, they‚Äôd be close enough to the ruling class to understand how Epstein fit in with it.Nobody in DC needs to be blackmailed into stabbing the people in the back. Betraying you is the job, and they want it. (Clarence Thomas doesn‚Äôt, but his vote never counts, so they let him play in a puddle.) Epstein had nothing on anybody. He was a pimp with a shiksa-defilement fetish, and he knew where to peddle it. *That* is his message.Cops don‚Äôt side with antifa/BLM against MAGA for ‚Äúmuh pension.‚Äù They do it because they want to hurt you‚Äîbecause you‚Äôre innocent.How many NGs refused to be deployed to the capital‚Äîdirectly against their ‚Äúbrothers?‚Äù Of thousands, not one.Etc.Our enemies are our enemies.

                        I think you dismiss Epstein too easily. Just look at his ‚Äúresume.‚Äù Nobody comes from relative obscurity to being a multi-millionaire and rubbing shoulders with the  world‚Äôs most powerful. He was a known (convicted) child prostitution pimp and suspected of much worse. While the full story will probably never come out, a reasonable hypothesis is that Epstein was an asset for domestic or foreign intelligence. Acosta and others have even made statements to the effect. Epstein‚Äôs mission was to schmooze with the elite, try and get dirt on them (a video of sex with a minor will do nicely!) and presumably, keep dossiers that could be used to coerce these players. Blackmail is possible, but unlikely since the big organization that do this kind of stuff don‚Äôt need pocket change. Epstein was likely a Mossad agent, but could have been working for one of the alphabet agencies. Or both.

        People who claim to know about these things believe the court could overturn or sharply limit Roe v. WadeI also find it hard to believe anything substantive will change wrt RvW.  My prediction is nothing changes, but Thomas and Alito dissent, and the rest of the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù clowns write some incomprehensible 50 page gibberish about why they can‚Äôt change RvW despite its obvious flaws.The gun rights is a closer call, but the 2nd Amendment does say ‚Äúbear arms‚Äù not ‚Äústore arms‚Äù or ‚Äúown arms.‚Äù  Storing and owning would be useless if you could not bear them.  But that is simply reading the words and applying third grade level comprehension.  It would be a short, clear opinion of about 30 words which the SCROTUS is constitutionally incapable of generating.  They need a seven part test at a minimum to determine if a frog‚Äôs ass is watertight.

            The civnats are going to get a heaping pile of steaming edumacation on what ‚Äústare decisis‚Äù means wrt Roe.  Moloch must be sated.The gun thing I am less sure of.  Just like voting, they often let us win when it doesn‚Äôt matter.  If you want to carry, you leave NY CA or HI and move to a state that allows it.  Given the WhitExodus from Wokeistan, it is a self-resolving dispute as the number of ppl who want guns and are also behind enemy lines approaches a negligible rump f those willing to knuckle under.

        I kinda like the way Derbyshire gives odds on outcomes in his podcast. I give  a guess on the odds Z Man is right on the abortion case 70%. On the gun case 60%.On a separate note what are the odds the radical left in the United States has the same agenda as the Russians?They both coincidentally hate fossil fuels and hate red meat and the Russians just happen to set up a computer hack job that fulfills the wishes of our own left?I think the odds the Russians really did this?Maybe 30%.The odds it was somebody or some group associated with our own powers and our own elites?70%.

        I wonder who the Court will side with when more people realize that vaccinated females are sterilizing unvaccinated women through contact?
The ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is a live, engineered, mutagenic RNA virus after all.  Of course, by that time, many of the vaxxed will be dead or disabled, having done their job.
Perhaps the vaccine‚Äôs ‚Äòco-variants‚Äô will be roaring through the larger population by then. The finks might have more business on their plate than they expected.

            I‚Äôm not fan of the vaccine or Covidianism in general but what is the evidence of this? This sounds like one of those notions you hear from time to time that the elites are sooper-brains plotting all kinds of Bond villain type stuff in their secret underground labs. Everything I see though indicates that Z‚Äôs notion of them as basically blundering clowns is closer to reality.The most likely unfolding of the vaccine religion that I see is that the vaccines, being a novel technology (mRNA) as well as poorly tested, will turn out to be a massive oopsie. Some sort of ‚Äúvaccine syndrome‚Äù will start to be noticed and will then plague millions with chronic effects ranging from nuisances to occasional fatalities for years. Along with that it will turn out that the vaccines basically don‚Äôt work that well or for very long.The sensible thing to do at that point will be for everyone to just quietly walk away from the Covid religion and lock auntie Karen up in the attic with a few dozen 55 gal drums of Paul Masson. Of course, that‚Äôs why everyone will do the opposite and triple-down on vaccines and try to mandate weekly injections for everyone between 6 and 116 for life.This is all very bad of course but the overall picture just requires everyone to have been acting in accord with their greed, stupidity, short time horizons, and lust for power rather than some genius plot to sterilize the human race or some part of it (i.e. Whites)

                    Yes, there are documented cases of pretty severe ‚Äúvaccine hangover‚Äù. The term is apparently apt as the combination of foggy thinking, headache and nausea is similar to what you get after a serious bender. My coworkers are a bunch of pozzed goons who all got the vaccine as a religious sacrament as soon as they could and even they were talking about this on the internal message system. Of course to them it‚Äôs all for the Glorious Revolution so they don‚Äôt question anything ‚Äì Onward Comrades!The government and it‚Äôs enablers are still in the deny, deny, deny phase on this. The transition to the ‚Äúacknowledge and downplay‚Äù stage should come this summer. The media may stage a new wave of Burn-Loot-Murder this summer to act as a distraction ‚Äì or just because they didn‚Äôt work out all their hatred for us last summer. Rumor has it that there are still combustible materials in Portland and Minneapolis.

                I broadly agree.Mind you,  I‚Äôm in no hurry to get any COVID (or mRNA) vaccine. It‚Äôs entirely possible that the mRNA jabs do work, for the most part. For the sake of argument, let‚Äôs say that mRNA vaccines are on the whole, as effective as traditional vaccines in providing immunity.Aside: then the COVID jabs may only offer partial immunity. No one claims they provided complete immunity. I expect the benefit is similar to a flu or pneumonia vaccine, which represents a ‚Äúbest guess‚Äù of what the following season‚Äôs viruses will be. We already are at the point with COVID variants that vax makers are planning, if not already providing, jabs for the the mutations.But like you (?) I am leery of long-term harmful side effects.I agree that sometimes the conspiracy theories get a little too wild. But that need not detract from their entertainment value üôÇ

        People who claim to know about these things believe the court could overturn or sharply limit Roe v. WadeI also find it hard to believe anything substantive will change wrt RvW.  My prediction is nothing changes, but Thomas and Alito dissent, and the rest of the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù clowns write some incomprehensible 50 page gibberish about why they can‚Äôt change RvW despite its obvious flaws.The gun rights is a closer call, but the 2nd Amendment does say ‚Äúbear arms‚Äù not ‚Äústore arms‚Äù or ‚Äúown arms.‚Äù  Storing and owning would be useless if you could not bear them.  But that is simply reading the words and applying third grade level comprehension.  It would be a short, clear opinion of about 30 words which the SCROTUS is constitutionally incapable of generating.  They need a seven part test at a minimum to determine if a frog‚Äôs ass is watertight.

        It really doesn‚Äôt matter how those two cases are decided, women are going to terminate pregnancies no matter what and guys are going to pack firearms as well. Look how effectively the prohibition of alcohol and drugs have worked out.A ladder would be needed to get over the top of the pile of federal and state regulations that the various levels of government have enacted to solve all the possible problems.  More than ever, the cops selectively enforce the law. Speeding and reckless driving is everywhere on the highway, carjacking and strong arm robberies are affecting once placid communities with little evident police response. The supremes don‚Äôt seem to have a positive role in societal developments. Their decisions are generally ignored except by only the secular legal priests, among whom they are the leaders.

            It‚Äôs not the same. You can ferment alcohol from lots of different household ingredients. It‚Äôs a lot harder to manufacture weaponry and the ammunition to go along with them from just the stuff lying around your garage. Sure, some guns will get through an embargo, but then mostly to criminals and not to Joe Normie White Guy who would never risk his career by committing a felony weapon possession or manufacturing violation.

                There are more than enough weaponry to go around now.  Most everyone that wants, has.  And the few who remain unarmed, but are willing, can get one from those who have surplus.  Now as to supplies like munitions, you can pick them off of the ground after engagement with a few other choice weaponry.

                Ever see the Broadway musical or movie ‚ÄúWest Side Story‚Äù?It‚Äôs about gangs in post-WWII New York. The weapons that did most of the damage in that era were ‚Äúzip guns‚Äù, manufactured by ingenious criminals who couldn‚Äôt access genuine firearms for one reason or another. They built primitive but cheap and effective handguns that were commonly used until real pistols became available. It would be even easier to put zip guns back on the street now as the technology to make them is much better.

        Z, I am not the political prognosticator you are, but here are my takes on each case:Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization. ‚Äì Roe V.

Here‚Äôs no fault divorce, and we‚Äôll force your ex to pay child support.So, Roe V. Wade repealed? In light of all that, nope. Think people (especially women) were driven crazy by Orange Man Bad being President and Bret Kavanaugh getting appointed to the USSC? Buddy, you ain‚Äôt seen NOTHING yet!

Besides, someone with a hidden bang stick might kill me while I try to bash their skull in for Social Justice, and that‚Äôs bad.Of course you would express it more elegantly than I do.

            It would be really smart of the regime to let the Mississippi law stand.  I am going to go out on a limb and say the overwhelming majority of post 15 week abortions in Mississippi are done on poor black women.  This restriction won‚Äôt impact any member of the elite.  The problem for them is that abortion is one of the sacraments of their new religion.  Allowing this law to stand will enrage one of their core support groups, liberal, childless women who have sex twice a year while using three different kinds of birth control.  As they are purely controlled by their emotions, they cannot comprehend this law has no personal impact on them.

        Yeah as Z has said before all they needed to do was co-opt Trump and give some symbolic meat to the MAGA voters to keep them invested in the system.Big Shiny Wall with a giant, ‚Äúskills based‚Äù door like we had in Canada for so long swamps the country with non-white, Democrat voting aliens anyways. Some useless abortion restriction stopping it after 15 weeks (only a small % of abortions are after 12 weeks). Let the MAGA rubes have a demonstration on January 6 to blow off some steam.They either hate us too much or are too incompetent to understand how power works. They‚Äôve clearly decided that white people, by and large have no future in their country. Just look at the ads on TV. So why give them a voice?Of course, they are winning pretty much unopposed, demographically the great replacement chugs along. Whether or not they hold onto their power to the brown hordes is still in question (probably not), but no doubt white america as it previously existed no longer is around.

                    And that brings up my other thought. No matter what the Court rules, our totally legitimate rulers will simply ignore it if they so choose. After all, the Lincoln administration gave zero fucks about Taney and the Supremes. In fact, Saint Abraham gave serious thought to having the Chief Justice arrested in 1861. I expect Potato Joe‚Äôs Jolly Junta to do the same, as they love to toss around 1860s words like ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù‚Ä¶
We didn‚Äôt vote our way out of this, and we‚Äôre surely not going to lawyer our way out.

                    Here‚Äôs an appropriate place to pitch what I mean only half-jokingly. So far as I know, when the slaves were freed in the USA, the former slave owners received no compensation. This is clearly in violation of the amendment that says among other things, that a person may not be deprived of property without compensation. Slave owners had committed no crime up until when slavery was outlawed.   Some Union states had legal slavery, Maryland for one. It‚Äôd only be a footnote of our legal history, but I‚Äôd be fascinated to know if a lawsuit was ever filed for such a claim, and how the government weaseled out of it. If the former slaves are owed ‚Äúreparations‚Äù (under what legal theory?), then certainly former owners have a better claim to payback.

        I have to completely agree on with Z‚Äôs take. I said to some associates years ago that, when those two or three states restricted abortion, these laws would eventually be struck down by the Supreme Court. The ruling will de facto legalize all, including third term. Anyone who is too foolish to see the parallels to Cali prop 8 has their head in the sand.

                That‚Äôs what gets me about the Pro-Life movement.
They say a fetus is the moral equivalent of anyone else.  They say abortion doctors are literally worse than Nazis because they have killed many more millions of ‚Äúpeople‚Äù
Yet they crap their pant at the mere suggestion of putting a woman in jail for having an abortion.
Nope, pro-lifers actions clearly demonstrate that they don‚Äôt believe a fetus is an actual person with the same ‚Äúright‚Äù
Pro-life rhetoric is overheated nonsense.

                    It‚Äôs worse than that. Pregnant women who give birth to a child with fetal alcohol syndrome face no dire personal consequences. It‚Äôs illegal to poison a baby but not a baby under construction. Hopefully, at some point a fetal alcohol victim will sue the mother and bring this tragedy into the national spotlight.

        The Supreme Court tangibly declared itself to be corrupt when it shirked its duty to allow litigation over the the 2020 election fraud. Everything downstream is therefore irrelevant at this point as a matter of law (they effectively killed off the principle of the rule of law). And everything they do or don‚Äôt do now will piss off half the country and further reinforce the perception of partisanship and illegitimacy by the Court.As a result, most ordinary citizens will continue to transition from being predominantly ‚Äúlaw abiding‚Äù to being selectively ‚Äúlaw breaking‚Äù when it suits their interests in a significant way. This will initially take form with respect to firearms, ammunition, and other forms of personal protection equipment. And as social trust continues to decline, will expand into many other areas. The spring is winding tighter faster.

        Christians are already starting to organize, though not quite outside of the system, yet. I meet with a small group every few weeks or so to discuss things going on in the area. Right now there‚Äôs a big push back against liberals trying to promote transgenderism in the schools. We‚Äôre making some inroads and miraculously, one of the big promoters of encouraging kids to become trannies without parental involvement recently got removed from office for sexual harassment. His replacement is much more sympathetic to our cause.We‚Äôre also working to get pornographic materials removed from school libraries. Believe it or not, but there has been a lot of smut being pushed as ‚Äúeducational‚Äù material in schools, even though it‚Äôs against Florida law. That said, I think the proliferation of smart phones is the bigger problem. What I‚Äôd like to see is a movement to take away their smartphones until they are 18. But that‚Äôs probably a long ways off.

                    Correct. Our church now literally runs it‚Äôs own education program. Technically the parents are home-schoolers, but church coordinates with them for intramural events, field trips scholastic testing, and other stuff. The kids are focused on academics and they will wipe the mat with public school students. The local teachers unions are shitting bricks ‚Äì and they are square! They are trying to ban us and probably won‚Äôt succeed. The kids actually enjoy it and have fun, too ‚Äì which just blows the normies away.I disagree about smartphones though. At some point the kids are going to have to deal with them. It‚Äôs like having guns in the home. Expose the kids to them, make sure they can handle them and use them safely ‚Äì and you have nothing to worry about.

                        Yup. Bible believing churches in Ontario are now running their own ‚Äúacademies‚Äù too. The cost is high but of course arrangements can always be made.
They are weak on race, but you can‚Äôt have it all. The white kids are encouraged to excel academically and not to be self hating trannies.

                        Teacher‚Äôs unions are already getting their lackeys to lay the groundwork for going after homeschooling and unaccredited, small private schools.  We are looking into both options for our kids.  I am hopeful enough liberals are disgusted with the Covid shutdowns to keep this at bay in the short term.

                        If you are footing a bill for a private school, I hope that you will vet the school beforehand.

My wife will literally carry her phone wherever she goes and surf, everywhere.  She gets up in the morning and reaches for it like a smoker needing a cigarette.  She goes to bed with it and surfs until she falls asleep.  Of course, whenever the phone receives a text message,  reaches for it.  Dinner time, whenever.Now she is highly educated (3 advanced degrees),  tell her she has an addiction and you‚Äôre in for a fight!  How much more clueless can the average joker be?

                You have a point, but there is a strong current among today‚Äôs youth that is looking for more order, more tradition and more meaning and they will not be repulsed by this.
On a related note, I think the embrace of liberal values by the Church and by the protestant churches has been a disaster and has accelerated the crisis of modern Christianity. Churches should be turning in the opposite direction and become reactionary again. Otherwise, they have nothing of substance to offer.

No, they definitely will be. I say that as someone deeply familiar with that crowd. Anyone who thinks otherwise is over the age of 50. The only people you‚Äôll appeal to are SJW Leftists. You‚Äôll divide your side with this ‚Äúmuh pornography‚Äù (meaning innocuous things in many cases) rhetoric while the other side takes your own goals and runs up the score.There are countless videos like this on YouTube from dozens of popular, non-Leftist, creators. This one has over 100k views and there are hundreds more.‚ÄúEmbrace Puritan Values!

Let‚Äôs face it, probably more than half the posters here are over the age of 60. Politics for this side of the aisle is mostly wash, rinse, and repeat ancient childhood dogmas.

                        Who said anything about embracing Puritan values? Your argument is basically the same as cuckservatives ‚Äì give up everything (eventually) to appeal to leftist morality. It‚Äôs a losing strategy. Past several decades have proven that many times over.
The part of your argument I agree with is to not go overboard with the fight against pornography. However, *actual* pornography should be fought against and it‚Äôs elimination from anything resembling mainstream is a worthy goal.
FYI, I am not over 50 and you are not the only one ‚Äúfamiliar with the crowd‚Äù.

                You are conflating groups.  Culture is largely genetic.  There will be the naturally leftist ‚Äúhip cool‚Äù croud with their drugs, porn, and edgy media/art, wwhich appeals to leftist r-selected teens, the Young Democrats or whatnot. They are wired differently, and we will not reach them.  They are fundamentally different from us.But the young right-ists will be alienated by the lack of order, consistency, heirarchy, and will follow someone willing to call filth what it is.  Take a right winger, whether 17 or 77, and show them a ‚Äútranny story hour‚Äù or a john waters movie, and they will take the pitchfork you offer them. Disgust with filth is a genetically implanted reaction in rightwingers, they do toddler tests and find this.  Read some Ed Dutton.The leftists will always want openness, inclusion, and lack of judgment, your ‚Äúcool hip kids.‚Äù But our progeny, and those like us, will be disgusted and want an alternative ‚Äì think the preppy movement in the 80‚Äôs, when teens started wearing slacks and blazers to stand out in opposition against the hippy crap.Thinking the preppy Christian white kids and the punk goths respond to the same messages in the same way is just wrong, though.

                    ‚ÄúThinking the preppy Christian white kids and the punk goths respond to the same messages in the same way is just wrong, though.‚ÄùThere are far more non-preppy, non-dogmatically religious White kids than preppy Christian White kids. All you‚Äôll do is trade in a larger demographic for a much smaller one ‚Äî smaller every day as America becomes increasingly secular.Repeating jargon about r-selection and Edward Dutton doesn‚Äôt discount my comment, which is almost certainly true. There are far more non-dogmatically religious people than dogmatically religious people. Only about 25% of those who call themselves Christian can even name a majority of the 10 Commandments, for instance. Most people are merely religious in a very broad, non-committed sense ‚Äî at least when it comes to traditional religion these days. The future isn‚Äôt won by appealing to a shrinking demographic.The Left won the culture war, among many reasons, because they appealed to a larger audience through their control of the entertainment media. Self-fulfillment, pleasure-seeking, etc. are also genetic. They appealed to that demographic by portraying you as backwards, censorious, prudes who stood in the way of their fulfillment and pleasure-seeking. It‚Äôs true. Doesn‚Äôt anyone remember popular culture from 1968 ‚Äî 2008? Now you want to give the other side a reason to pick up where they left off?The Right lost because they are chronically incapable of prioritizing issues (race ahead of social conservatism, immigration restriction ahead of cheap labor, etc). For example, we have people here complaining about abortion, but abortion clearly benefits our people because it‚Äôs mainly a procedure for poor blacks, a demographic that is a heavy burden on society and a barrier to political power at the ballot box. The court should find a way to continue the practice. That should be our position.In any conflict you pick your battles wisely. Conservatives want to pick and lose EVERY battle because they won‚Äôt strategically pick winning positions for the greater goal of winning the war. Conservatives just can‚Äôt see the forest for the trees, so they lose.

                One other thing re Street Fighter: you also have to remember these people hate truth, beauty, and God.  The pornographic crap they push isn‚Äôt mid-20‚Äôs Jenna Jameson shaking her ta-tas, its more like Stacy Abrams anally plundering some nebbish white boy. Mentally healthy people of any age who see the garbage the left puts out as erotica/‚Äùsex ed‚Äù think ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see Stacy Abrams‚Äô flabby haunches, girded with a strapon‚Äù not ‚Äúthey‚Äôre trying to ban fun.‚Äù

                    I have a feeling conservatives won‚Äôt stop with Jenna. Not too long ago, one of the last Christian feminists got Cosmopolitan Magazine banned from my grocery store (admittedly, not a huge loss) on grounds of disrespecting women. Feminism hiding under the cloak of conservatism was quite common for a long time in our culture. They are the ones who wanted to censor risque television shows like Married With Children and complained about violence in movies. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs where the conservative demographic will again head back to in the near future. It won‚Äôt be long before they are attacking violence in video games or trying to cover up women in comics and movies.Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing. Conservatives are worthless. So, maybe we can straighten out our culture by giving the other side, which although mentally defective is at least capable, a boogeyman to oppose. We can dress up like those monsters in The Village and scare Leftists into adopting principles of liberty, freedom, and moderation in order to demonstrate their virtue instead of wasting their lives causing trouble on social media. As sad as that sounds, that may be our only way out of this mess because Conservatives are ‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôve already said it.

        Speaking of mistakes, there‚Äôs also the fact that while ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù (for rhetorical convenience) are usually pretty good at figuring out how ‚Äúliberals‚Äù (ditto) think, the reverse doesn‚Äôt apply. (I recall some Soash study the Left was trumpeting a while back ‚Äì ‚Äúeven conservatives think liberals care more!‚Äù When in fact what it actually said was, conservatives believed liberals *believe* they care more. The study was about ‚Äúperspective taking,‚Äù or what‚Äôs known in child psych as the ‚ÄúSally Ann Test.‚Äù Conservatives are good at it; the Left, very very bad).We could probably find some modus vivendi with these lunatics, as their lunacy follows some general patterns. They will never find one for us, because they have no idea what, let alone how, we think. And since politics operates on a kind of Say‚Äôs law (supply creates its own demand), their constant search for e.g. ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù will bring one into being.

                I‚Äôve thought of that too! Great minds think alike‚Ä¶ and, apparently, so do ours.
The problem, though (aside from worker‚Äôs comp) is that the Left, far from being cunning, can‚Äôt turn it off. That Richard Spencer guy sounds like the best thing that ever happened to them.

        Core inflation will take a while to play out, but will be the real killer.  Right now ‚Äúsubstitution‚Äù and cash reserves are covering for it.  But as fuel and higher commodity prices drive through the production chain, substitutes (chicken for beef) will start to vanish.  Add in the inevitable tax hikes on middle class and the frog will begin to realize it is boiling.  Lived through the last hyperinflation and it is not a pretty thing.  But back then we had a much less ‚Äúvibrant‚Äù populace and lower social program costs. Crime, like inflation, takes a while to wend its way through the normie system.  Right now still mostly vibrant on vibrant.  But hunch is they will increasingly realize they can expand their area of operations more aggressively.  Already seeing, in NYC, blatant daylight attacks in places that were crime free.  Once a big enough network of normal people all know a victim or were one themselves‚Äìit will get interesting.

            1970‚Äôs America was 80% white, mostly church going and mostly nuclear family. That was the real social safety net. By the end of the decade, much of the safety net was destroyed, but crime, inflation and social volatility were in sharp decline. I suspect the ruling class assumes the surveillance state and firm control of the political process will be enough to keep a lid on things. Their paranoia, on the other hand, suggest they are not entirely sure of that.

                All due respect to your excellent post(s) and yourself, but the motives for monumental fuckups aren‚Äôt important. If your government is populated by monumental fuckups the only solution is removal, even if they are replaced by more monumental fuckups.

                I don‚Äôt have any backlog of evictions to process. Almost all of my tenants paid as usual throughout the pandemic. And my tenants are exactly the type of working class people, majority black, who were hit hardest by the pandemic.
I‚Äôm fairly sure the coming eviction ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù is way overblown. Fear sells pageviews.

            When inflation kills money, it will look like ‚Äúhigh prices‚Äù.
The inevitable ‚Äúsolution‚Äù?   Price controls, to ‚Äústop the greedy producers‚Äù.
There‚Äôs no idea so dumb that it can‚Äôt be tried over and over and over.  Because this time, it will be different.

                Rationing is more likely.  Price controls don‚Äôt give them leverage to dole out sustenance and favors to ensure enthusiastic kneeling and feet-washing, or to punish the badwhites. And the fact everything is or can be bought on an app will greatly increase the feasibility of this: you‚Äôll have to order your groceries in the Dangerway app, but can‚Äôt place the order without sufficient gubmint karma credits. And we will be shocked, SHOCKED to find tha being badwhites means we het fewer or none of those, irrespective of your USD bank account balance.

            SamlAdams:  I agree wrt inflation.  The rising cost of all sorts of unexpected things is really startling.  Add in increasing unavailability (either supply chain issues or panic demand outstripping supply) and I think people might start taking notice by Christmas.  Oh, their big screen tvs and various plastic Chinese junk will be available, but a roast for dinner will be stratospheric, and a portable propane heater for the inevitable power outages will still be out of stock everywhere.When it comes to crime, I‚Äôm not as certain.  There certainly will be more, and it will be in places previously considered ‚Äòsafe,‚Äô but I‚Äôm not so sure White reaction will change.  There are still far too many with Amy Biehl/Amanda Blackburn syndrome.  Even when little Cash Gernon was stabbed to death, not a whisper about race.  If anyone dared notice, it wouldn‚Äôt be publicized anyhow.  The typical female commenter at Mail Online is both fed up with Critical Race Theory and endless woke nonsense, but also still prattling about how these things ‚Äòdivide us‚Äô.  Civnattery* and equality still have a stranglehold, both in the US and the UK and the rest of the anglosphere.  I would love to see it all crack, but I think it will take something a lot more catastrophic than inflation and a few hundred more home invasions for Whites to give up their most cherished lies.*My husband had a long conversation with a high school buddy a few days ago.  Smart guy and increasingly aware of some things, but determined to keep his head buried about most others.  What news he gets on the internet is still from Conservative Inc., and he had literally never heard the term ‚Äòcivnat,‚Äô and my husband had to explain.  As shocking as it is to me, I realize he‚Äôs probably one of millions.

                As FUBAR as the supply chain has been this year ‚Äì and will continue to be throughout ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure everyone will even have all their Chinese plastic junk by Christmas.  Perhaps the tipping point will be inavailability of some toy everyone must have but can‚Äôt get.  I‚Äôve always suspected the final push over the cliff and descent into..whatever happens next..will be the result of an otherwise innocuous trifle.

                3g, I think you are partially right re crime. Currently the normie is in condition white, but the rumblings of awakening nare there.  It used to be nothing would penetrate the fog, but now we are seeing little blips and burps where the containment field fails ‚Äì the Steinle thing made waves, even in an ultra-far-left area, or the Tibbits thing got national attention.  The normiecons just need reinforcement, to begin believing these are not isolated incidents, and to start personally feeling the fear.  It happened before in the early 90‚Äôs, it got so important to all the Beckys that we had the left crowing about locking up superpredator joggers.

                    Dalek commented, essentially, the 3S approach won‚Äôt work due to the layers of surveillance in everyday life. I suspect that we will figure out how to get around that problem. Perhaps not in the moment of being attacked, but when cleaning house becomes the flavor of the day, we will choose the time and location shifted advantage needed to execute (heh) the problem(s).The constant surveillance may also motivate our people caught in the moment defending themselves to simply leave no living witnesses. Yes, streaming devices and fixed cameras may be an issue. But dead men tell no tales.When we get to that point, I believe the Bystander Documentarians crowd will shrink dramatically, as their presence presents a target. Perhaps that‚Äôs just me.

                        ‚ÄúThe irony is that as a tracking device the smartphone would make it just as easy to catch burglars as it would be to prosecute home-defenders,‚Äù
In some ways it‚Äôs understandable. Dead people don‚Äôt have privacy rights. Subpoenaing a murder victim‚Äôs location data isn‚Äôt hard, and it‚Äôs just the data of one person.
For a burglary, unless you think you already know who the burglar is, you have to check the location data of everyone who was within proximity of nearby cell towers during the crime window. That‚Äôs a lot more invasive of public privacy.

Give the phone a good washing in battery acid! Run over it with your car. Then bury it 6 feet under!

            Dalek, how do you propose to respond to attack, in light of your outlined state of affairs? Your plan is to lay down and accept death? I‚Äôm genuinely trying to understand the value of pointing out the precedent, without offering something different.

        One of my colleagues had Barrett as a lecturer in her time in Law School.  Apparently Barrett went into a rage when she was caught checking email in class.  At the performance assessment, she stated my colleague knew the material very well, but had appalling decorum in the classroom.From this anecdote, I would bet Barrett is going to put respectability above everything else and use any weaseling possible to get the respectable ruling.  She won‚Äôt hesitate to limit Roe v. Wade for the reason that it would get her ostracized in her circles and she has some genuine principles regarding abortion, but she won‚Äôt blink in ruling with the left on gun control and immigration.

                I‚Äôve pushed the idea to civnats that the constitution has become effectively useless because the progressives have figured out easy workarounds by emphasizing the letter of the law rather than the spirit. You can ban conservative speech by working with ‚Äúprivate companies like google or bookpublishers. They‚Äôre looking to contract a private company to monitor the internet activity of conservatives. They have companies enforce covid passport systems to get their jabs. The republicans then shuffle their feet and say ‚Äúoh well‚Äù because they don‚Äôt want to regulate private companies. Many civnats are starting to wake up and acknowledge these points when I bring them up.
