        Oh come on Z.Francis knew he was out on the edge.Regardless of the l’affaire d’Francis.What was D’Souza thinking?Doesn’t he know that every public conservative is on double secret probation.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0cF2piwjYQDid he really think a Republican senate candidate had a chance to win in the land of Schumer and Gillibrand?So now D’Souza has made two friends complicit in an election funding fraud and turned himself into a felon.D’Souza earlier wrote a book called: ‘What’s So Great about Christianity’. I guess he missed the parts about moral behavior.Why is that conservatives have so much trouble understanding that there are different rules for themselves vs the Progressives?…

            I was being a bit snarky there, but I’ve always suspected D’Souza is a mere opportunist. I have not problem with a man making a living peddling his version of reality. If I could figure out how to make this pay I’d quit my day job. I just think D’Souza would become a Communist and make bio-pics of Marx if someone offered him enough money.
