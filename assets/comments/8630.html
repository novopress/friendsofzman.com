        I was really slow to pick up on the complete triumph of neo-conservatism.  During the Bush years, like an idiot, I’d defend the Republicans’ holy crusade to bring democracy to the Muslim world, and was confused when people would call ME a neo-conservative.  “What are they talking about?” I’d think. “I was born conservative, in a conservative family, 57 years ago.  I’ve never been anything BUT conservative.  Neo-conservatives are people who used to be leftists who saw the light and converted – that’s not me.”  But I didn’t realize that the whole “conservative movement” was being run by those former leftists, and by carrying water for them I was by default wearing the same colours.  Old-fashioned conservatives like me might outnumber them (and by a lot, judging by the Trump-induced unmasking) but we all had “Property of the New World Order” branded on our butts, and our individual biographies didn’t count.

                I’m in that category, too, although not the right religion to be a true neocon. I also was behind the “invade the world ” meme, ( mea maxima culpa) although really was never behind the “invite the world” part, with the exception of hockey players and Swedish models. I tend to agree with the whole “propositional nation ” deal, except that there are some cultures and religions that can (or will) never assimilate.  They are best avoided. The other problem is that we don’t have the cultural confidence of 100 years ago. If we are going to be a propositional nation, we need to insist that people accept the proposition.

                        I was thinking more about the likes of Elin Nordegren and her identical twin sister. SAABs were fun cars- way too expensive to maintain, though.

            A lot of us were not paying attention. John Derbyshire has talked a lot about getting talked into the warmongering stuff. Normal people tend to trust people who seem earnest and optimistic. As a result, we were all fooled.

                That the neocons are STILL on the “Invade the world, invite the world” train, after all that’s happened in the past 13 years to completely discredit it, leads me to think in the “stupid or liar?” formulation, they are most certainly the latter.

                The problem ultimately boils down to the fact that what makes up the mainstream right doesn’t win anything. The complaints about Iraq are valid but victory would have silenced a lot of it. But they couldn’t deliver it. And now its come to the point that they can’t win elections either. 2012 was the breaking point more than any war because it was an election that should have been won and instead we are living through the second coming of David Dinkins.

            I think what pushed me to warmongering was the public unveiling of the A Q Khan network. I never asked myself how a hellhole like Pakistan was able to build large numbers of atomic weapons. Then suddenly, there was the answer: almost the whole of Islamic civilization, from Malaysia to Mauritania was funding, supplying, and enabling an Islamic bomb. I was willing to support anything that would degrade Dar al Islam’s WMD networks, even if it had to only a.very indirect effect.I can’t point to any one thing that pushed me away from the new-cons. Maybe it was just ten years of being apart from the coastal elites and among regular folk. It will become clearer in retrospect.

            Personally, I never believed in, supported or bought into the BS about nation building.  Oh Yes, we can name that tune “Democracy” in 3-5 years!  Give me an f’ng break.  Look how long we stayed in Japan, Germany, the Philippines, and other countries post-WWII and did we really ever get those nations/countries to become “Democracies?”  Some, a variation maybe … but many … not really.  More like putting lipstick on a pig (American brands, slang, Hollywood, etc.) but the underlying culture is still there.  How do you tell someone they are now “free” when they haven’t they faintest idea what it means to be free?  Oh, you let them vote.  That means they are free!  They get to wave a purple finger in the air for the cameras.  BS.I never bought the “taking democracy to the ME” because I understood that, at a minimum, it would require an investment (presence) for multiple decades, or several generations for the ideas to take root.  I could tell the American public had no stomach for that kind of involvement.  And of course, neither did our so-called Allies.  America always does the heavy lifting financially and militarily.  That is why so many who support Trump, also want to get out of the UN, NATO, etc. because our so-called Allies won’t even pay for their defense.  And more of our leaders want to sell us down the river to be ruled by nameless, faceless bureaucrats in Brussels.  Talk about sellouts.The reason I did support getting involved was the threat posed by Iran (becoming a Nuke member) and being supported by the likes of Russia, China, NoKo, and Pokeeston.  Taking Iraq would give the Al Qaeda complete and unfettered roaming rights around the entire middle east, and pose and existential threat to Israel whom I do support.  I saw it more as a geopolitical move.But just now I read that “W” has said he is going to vote for Hillary.  Man, I tell you this whole thing is only about one thing … $$$$.  These people don’t give a crap about America or Americans.  Their globalist ideas means their wealth can take them wherever they please, whenever they please, however they please.  Hearing that makes a complete mockery of the speech Bush gave at Ground Zero following 9/11.  Makes me sick.  And Jacoby, who the f*ck is that!

                I agree, LP.  I had no problem with the Afghan war: bomb the crap out of them until grown men bawl at the word “America”.  I was still in that mood the following year, when the idea of going into Iraq arose.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited… for Bush to launch his grand Armada of the Willing, with great pomp and ceremony, while the anti-war pukes got their wind back and began to take back the initiative.  But when it FINALLY got going, it seemed to go well, until Bush began to see himself as the Apostle to the Muslims, and started his idiotic idea of converting Muslims to Democracy.It still took me a long time to realize that the war had become impossible, though.  Like the Z-man says, we trust people who are earnest and optimistic.  My first thought was that Arabs couldn’t really develop a Western-style democracy, but the conservative side was quick to shame anyone who was so “bigoted” as to think that foreigners “didn’t deserve” a nice, peaceful life under democracy like we had.  So I stifled my doubts.  Mark Steyn was convinced it was a workable idea, and I trusted his judgment, so I figured I must be wrong.  I actually was still supporting the war when Dubya left office – that’s how naive I was.I never did overcome my skepticism about the “Religion of Peace” crap, but we all told ourselves that that was just candy-coating to placate the Muslims, and Bush didn’t REALLY believe it.  Eventually I realized that he DID believe it, and was too stupid and stubborn to learn from experience.  I saw his hurried evacuation of Saudi families after 9/11 as a sign that he saw them as fellow royalty:  money royalty, and even more, OIL royalty.  I don’t think THEY think that about him, but I’m convinced that he sees them as members with his family, of a special caste.  He thinks they understand each other on a unique level; I think they’d be happy to cut his head off the moment it became safe to do so.

            I remember the beginning of the second (Bush Jr.) Iraq war very clearly because I was immersed in an intensive study of the US occupation of Japan at the time.  At the outset, I supported the war as a calculated gamble, as the Bushies promise was to put an end to Islamist/Arab radicalism by transforming Iraq into a functioning secular state on the Turkish model. I recall thinking that this was a gamble, rather than a foregone conclusion, as the Bushies seemed to, because to my mind the only way that this could possibly work was if we turned Iraq over to a new MacArthur and let him call the shots – and I didn’t see any MacArthurs in the wings (although a Schwarzkopf might have been able to pull it off).  It didn’t take long for me to realize that the whole thing was likely to end in disaster when US forces allowed the looting of Baghdad as soon as they’d taken the city, instead of declaring martial law and shooting looters on sight. This seemed completely insane to me. The second indication this would end badly was when US and British forces refused to disarm the Shiite militias of Muqtada al-Sadr.  Again, this was self-evident to anyone except the Pentagon, because you cannot create a functioning political culture if the emerging political parties are allowed to have armies.  And then there was the decision to purge all Baathists from the government, meaning that Iraq would have no functioning administration for years.  I still submit, contrary to many, that Iraq could have been a relative success, but the Bush people either had no idea what they were doing or didn’t have the stomach for what needed to be done.

                Amen Brother!  You too understand the “investment” that would have been required.  Your statement “And then there was the decision to purge all Baathists from the government, meaning that Iraq would have no functioning administration for years.” states a fact that smart men knew even after Germany surrendered in WWII.  Did the Allies kick all Nazi’s and German’s supporting the Third Reich out of the branches of government?  No.  They left it functioning, although under a new administration.And just why was a putz like Paul “whatzhizname” Bremer put in charge?  He was a fricking dip”shit”lomat.  He had shit-4-brains.  I blame him for the progressive move to dismantle the Iraqi Army.  Talk about stupid.  And well, now we have what we have.  Lots of blame to go around, but that my friend, was the pinnacle of stupidity.  Only a diplomat would have thought of that and had the power to sell it.  And then came COIN.

            @ Emeritus – True enough. One only need look at Publius Quinctilius Varus and how hiring German mercenaries worked out for him. Suffice to say it worked out for us, but not so much for our Roman overseers. Arminius (Hermann the German) is now memorialized up on a hill to commemorate the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.

        We discovered in the 19th century that national identities CAN be constructed – e.g. Meiji Japan and Shinto, the cult of the Emperor, even very “traditional” Japanese stuff like sumo wrestling is, in any recognizable form, only about 150 years old.  We had this ad hoc in the US with things like baseball (your post below), and organizations like the Grand Army of the Republic (Union army vets) pushing Memorial Day, the Pledge of Allegiance, etc.  Problem is, you can’t do this stuff ironically… and modern people don’t know how to be sincere, thanks to 60+ years of postmodernism in public schools.  When you come right down to it, that’s what really bugs the Left about Trump – he likes what he likes because he likes it, full stop.

            Germany, too. One theory that tries to explain the origins of WW1 and WW2 holds that the Germans built up this huge educational and informational machine to unite the principalities in the 1880s and 90s and that the machine and the synthetic memes it created metasticized into militarism and Nazism. I’m not as familiar with Japanese history but have always suspected that something very similar happened.

                Actually, Germany was going very well up until WW1. We had 99% literacy which was better than France or the UK and a stronger industrial base. Then after WW1, we – along with everyone else in the world – enjoyed  a fun filled, hyper inflated depression and economic collapse. Tag on Germany’s repayment to the Brits and French – thanks to the Treaty of Versailles (along with a loss of 13% of German territory) – and things just kept getting better and better.Then we added in a failed Weimar Republic (and don’t kid yourself, Bismarck did some very good things for Germany), the popularity of the Nazi’s, (because Communists were bad) mix in patriotism and nationalism while blaming the foreigners (Jews) and top it all off with a dictatorship by eliminating the vote.Sound familiar? Let’s look at where we are 100-years later.Today we blame immigrants for all our problems on the one hand, while our governments ships them in by the millions. We have taxes enough for relocating and caring for them, but not enough for our unemployed youth or to care for the elderly. A brand new century that has seen 16-years of non-stop “war on terror” with no end in sight. Jobs are outsourced, taxes decline, the economy is nearly at a standstill and we enslave the poor through social dependence on the government. The 1% has about 36% of all private wealth. Banks create money out of thin air. Our educational programs cater to snowflake students who can barely comprehend their college assignments and then there’s the media who are busy covering up the truth or simply don’t have a clue.What could possibly go wrong?  I’m guessing Hillary and the AfD.

            You seem to have some odd ideas about Japanese institutions and history. Belief in the emperor as a divine being goes back to the very beginning of Japanese history, two thousand years ago. Shinto is the original native religion, and predates the entry of Buddhism from China in the sixth century AD by centuries. Sumo I’m not as up on, but I’ve seen 18th century prints of sumo matches. The Meiji period (1868-1912) was simply the reign of the restored Emperor Meiji from the collapse of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1867 until his death in 1912, during which time Japan underwent a major process of economic, political, and technological modernization. It wasn’t some kind of artificial construction or nostalgic idyll intended to invoke a golden age that never actually existed.The reason the postwar US campaign of nation building worked in both Japan and Germany is primarily that we were dealing with rational, relatively organized and coherent people who had nothing better going on and were sincerely interested in improving their lot, as opposed to batshit crazy muslims who thrive on endless chaos and destruction.

        “There’s nothing connecting today’s voters with the lynch mobs of 150 years ago.”___________________________Strongly beg to differ! The Democratic Party is directly connected to the lynch mobs of by-gone eras!  DIRECTLY!
DEMs were: the national “Slavery-is-okay” party in 1860; the Copperheads who wanted to settle the Civil War with slavery intact; the organizers of the Knights of the Golden Circle, e.g. the Ku Klux Klan; opposition to every effort to get rid of Jim Crow and desegregation; opponents of every Civil Rights act from the 20’s to the 60’s;  indeed no more foul group exists than the DEMs.

        Obviously, no one would defend murder, but on the whole, the legal exclusion of Asian immigrants from the U.S. was probably a good thing, at least for the American worker. It was also probably good for China, in the long run. As is the case with Mexico today, it’s possible for immigration to be an overall net loss for both the sending and receiving countries.What really funny about idiots like Jacoby is that they define America as a proposition nation, but they don’t even require that immigrants agree with the alleged propositions, and assimilate to American culture. They are perfectly happy with Mexicans continuing to espouse Mexican values, Muslims Muslim values, etc. They are logically inconsistent even within their own false framework.By the way, the statement “One of the unique things about America is that anyone from anywhere can go there, get through the process of immigration and become and American” is highly questionable. It takes several generations to turn immigrants into Americans, if it happens at all. Is Jacoby an “American”? Given how much he seems to hate his country’s history and people, I’d say it’s pretty doubtful.

            The impression I get is that many Chinese that couldn’t make it to the States went to other parts of Asia. There are huge, long standing Chinese migrant communities in most Southeast Asian countries and in much of the Caribbean. They, like Germans and Jews, have long been a very mobile people. The Chinese diaspora is enormous and spans most countries. My in laws have intermarried with ethnic Chinese from Indonesia and Thailand and Jamaica.

        One of the unique things about America is that anyone from anywhere can go there, get through the process of immigration and become and American. No one blinks when a non-white person tells you they are an American. Everyone just accepts that they just are.It’s very different here, and in most of Europe. We have German hyphenated Turks, Russians, Poles, Syrians, etc. but no German would consider them ‘German’ even if they could quote passages of our constitution in perfect German. The same is true to some degree in France, Italy and other EU countries. When one arrives at the Stockholm airport and a black man at passport control asks for your passport, no one is fooled. Everyone knows they’re not Swedish.But you touch a good point. What is it that makes someone an American? You are the only true melting pot of the world and always have been for as long as you have existed. So what is it…the ability to speak English? Attending a church rather than a mosque? Working a job and paying taxes? Serving in the military?What is it exactly that defines you as an American in the way we Europeans identify ourselves as being French or German or Swiss?

            I think part of what’s going on in America is that question. What does it mean to be an American? The post-nationalist dreamers just assumed everyone would abandon their identity. Instead, everyone is now thinking about it and discovering that it is not all that clear.

                Thanks to the Internet, Skype, and other modern communications its not only possible but easy to maintain daily contact with your previous culture after immigrating. In past years, immigration meant leaving your country of a origin behind. These days Choosing not to assimilate is painless.
The modern cult of anti-racism and the welfare state also enable non-assimilation.

            Retaining control of US foreign policy is what drives Hillary’s flying monkeys… along with the millions Goldman Sachs and the Saudis have paid her.﻿.. NATO is an illegitimate occupier of the German Fatherland, and the minute the white majority is armed in Europe, the Zíonist crowned heads of the EUSSR will fall…The banksters need a war desperately right now. They’ve tried so hard in Syria and it just hasn’t worked. Now they’ve got crazy Trump actually saying we should stay out of the Middle East and focus on our own problems, and people are listening… What’s a self-respecting globalist financier to do?Without the US military killing people and breaking things, there is no future growth path for them. So they send their puppets like Kasich and Romney out to talk up the fight against “evil” and threaten Russia and China, hoping to fool those dumb white ‘Murkins one more time into sending their sons off to die for God and Country and Goldman Sachs.﻿The IMF is in bed with the Turks, Saudis, and NATO, they are worried about a Trump audit of the Federal Reserve… and about Trump and Putin teaming up to destroy them once and for all…﻿ Trump is a vote for peace, and peace does not make money for the weapon industry. The pseudo secular media and their globalist masters profit from destabilization.The U.S. State Dept. has been infested with communists since WW1 and Woodrow Wilson, they tried to steal the Russian elections for their comrades in the Russian Communist Party through non-profit n.g.o.s… just like at home in America…But Vladimir Putin beat them, so they launched a fággot jihad against the Russian Orthodox church over the punk rock band and the Olympics (something Bítch Romney stupidly piled onto) Miss neo-kabbalah lesbian Madonna, now rumored to be a Muslim convert, was flown in to agitate while Hillary was on a world-wide gay pride tour.When the Iron Curtain came down the Bolsheviks all fled to the other side because they knew what the Russians would do to them after 100 years of communism. The best thing about Russia getting Crimea back… Catherine the Great took it from the Turks… What happened right after Russia retook Crimea? The Russian FSB searched all the Turks living there… Why? Because NATO sponsors Islamist terrorism when it suits them to.The EUSSR needed Libya’s oil, but Muammar Gadaffi decided he wanted gold instead of worthless fiat currency from the EU… What was the first thing NATO did when Gaddafi was deposed besides stealing all of Libya’s gold? Form a new government? NOPE, they formed a new Libyan national bank. Now, why would they do that? Because even if Muammar was deposed, he and his heirs would still be the sole proprietors! While Leon Puñettas was so busy with gay pride celebrations at the Pentagon, three Navy Seals and a U.S. ambassador were murdered, all because everyone was being so fúcking gay.Like with the nonsense in Syria, the U.S. State Department armed terrorist rebels to get rid of Gadaffi, the same ones that killed Ambassador Stevens and stole weapons from that secret armory in the basement… It was easy to dispose of the hated Muammar Gaddafi, but Bashar al Assad has friends…Syria and Ukraine are the same scenario as Serbia… NATO, under the direction of Jéws Albright and Clark, bombed Serbia so the IMF Jéws could make loans for rebuilding and get control of Serbian iridium assets… while Saudi non-profit n.g.o.s kept the KLA terrorists well fed and well armed… Albanian Muslims now operate human slaughterhouses in Kosovo where they rip out the organs of Christians to sell to Turkey and Saudi Arabia… How is Hillary Clinton’s “reset button” working out for America, comrades?Leute dummerweise denken, dass die Germanen nur in Deutschland zu finden sind… Ich habe Neuigkeiten für Sie! Sobald die NATO Besatzer vertrieben werden, werden wir eine weitere Nacht der langen Messer haben, merk dir meine Worte!﻿Eine Sturm kommt… Aus der Asche der alten Welt, entzündet sich eine neue Flamme… Unsere Welt wird brennen, die Angst und Zweifel werden im Feuer untergehen.﻿[Canada just replaced one chicken hawk with another chicken hawk… the jéw British monarchy wanted to “ban” Trump because he will disrupt the Afghanistan-Mexico heroine flow, they want chicken hawk jéw Sanders or Goldman Sachs puppets like Hillary or Cruz… The Vatican bank and Westminster (the British government bureaucracy, including the Church of England) are invested heavily in heroine smuggling, child trafficking, laundering money for Afghani and Latin American opium cartels, and Chief Justice Roberts (who was photographed entering the bank in Malta immediately after the Obamacare decision)… Sódom Hussein Obama’s visit to the Vatican was to provide secret NSA computer input to wipe out secret accounts held by Clinton’s Latin America Working Group, Goldman Sachs and the Jéwish sex slavery ring owned by Clinton friends Jeffrey Epstein and Alan Dershowitz… Steven Harper was a chicken hawk that let unrestricted immigration and drug smuggling to run rampant while having the antagonistic posture against Russia… gay boy chicken hawk Turdeau (sic) was handed down his yarmulke the same way divine monosyllable Dave Cameron got his, by looking the other way during the pedophile scandals and fúcking the dead kosher pig.]

        His purpose is to create a soothing fictitious relativity to the dichotomy. The traitor is a cuckservative. A card carrying member of the right wing of cultural marxism. A dutiful plant hiding behind a fig leaf of traditional conservatism. A seriously cunning deceiver. No different than the rest of the 5th column actors and agent provocateurs of the legacy media. Just a different flavor. His purpose is to represent a tempering political solice to the obvious cultural marxists in the media.

            It is a move made out of sheer desperation.  Why else wave their true colors so publicly?

        I wouldn’t mind the “proposition nation” stuff if the people parroting that line took the idea seriously, and were willing to put some teeth in it. Indeed, that seems like a reasonable compromise on this issue: “We restrictionists will accept the idea that America is a Proposition Nation if you open-borders types will start actually enforcing it and getting rid of foreigners who are patently uninterested in our nation’s central Propositions.”
Unfortunately, it seems, for many open-borders types, open borders ARE the central Proposition, to which everything else is subordinate. So compromise is impossible.

        There is an Aristotelian golden mean for just about everything. Revolutions are about achieving that mean once again after long periods of drifting away from it. The successful ones are those that stop somewhere near the mean and don’t overshoot too far. The trick is knowing when to stop, and being able to convince everyone else about your estimate.

        I’m uncertain if America is really a “Propositional Nation”.  But I do know the Soviet Union, of recent memory was explicitly a Propositional Nation, specifically the proposition of Internationalist Revolutionary Marxist-Leninism. And what did they do with those Slavs, Armenians, Uzbeks, and others who did not completely conform to that proposition? I think you remember what happens to those don’t agree – about thirty million of them. A Frenchman remains a Frenchman, and a German a German, regardless of politics. But in a propositional nation, other-thinkers forfeit their rights. I suggest Mr. Jacoby rethink before the Deplorable masses call the question on our dueling propositions.

            @ Rurik – I wonder if America suffers from too much diversity with all the hyphenated Americans. In Europe there are no hyphenated Germans or French or Italians. Generally speaking, the historical causes of division between people and nations here in Europe (both internally and externally) have been based on religion, not race.

                Not much Christianity left in Europe. Even the Irish conflict was about nationalism and rival ethnic groups (native Irish vs Ulster Scots “settlers”) instead of religion. IRA/Sinn Fein has been secular socialist since at least the 1970s-and today they are vocal supporters of same-sex marriage. And I’m pretty sure the Serbs and Croats weren’t fighting over Christian doctrine.Some churches *do* play the role of prog cultural Marxist social clubs:http://listeninginthedesert.com/?p=6490(…)Anthony Murphy, the editor of The Catholic Voice newspaper, had raised concerns about whether it was appropriate for two lesbians in a same-sex “marriage” to have such public and prominent roles within the parish.In the presence of five priests and a church packed with many who rarely attend Mass, Jacinta O’Donnell and Geraldine Flanagan led the choir in singing “I will follow him” from the film ‘Sister Act’. The two women held hands and bowed as many in the congregation applauded and cheered. This occurred on the sanctuary as the 5 priests processed out at the end of Mass.Mr. Murphy, editor of the newspaper Catholic Voice, says that he received a death threat during a hate campaign “whipped up” by local Sinn Fein councillors, and has been advised by the local curate and police not to attend Mass at St Michael’s due to concerns about his safety.“Just an update regarding the situation with the two “married” women in my local parish. They have resigned from their positions in the Church BUT today a mob has been whipped up into a frenzy by among others some of the local councillors and I am now the subject of a pretty intensive hate campaign. One Sinn Fein councillor has been particularly active in this regard and as a result of this incitement I have now received a death threat!! Apparently I am no longer welcome and I have been threatened by members of the local Sinn Fein Party not to go into my local town unless I have a ‘death wish.”(…)

        Neo-conservativism was probably necessary for what it was originally, an intellectual path to let the increasingly post-1960s leftwing elites to muddle through the second half of the Cold War. It was an adaption for the 1970s. (Take a look at fiction to get a hint of where everyone thought things were going, basically co-dominion like the end of Watchmen.) The problem is that we’re close to 30 years out from the end of the Cold War and they don’t seem to realize this.As for Trump, I think a lot of high pitched shrieking is a mix of class resentment and fear. Trump is rich but culturally he’s an outer-borough working man. And he’s not ashamed of it which is even worse to most of these scribblers losing their minds about him. As for the fear, its the feeling that they bet wrong. Logically an outsider like Trump wouldn’t have a chance in a normal race is the thinking so they all jumped into NeverTrump. But its not a normal race or normal year and that logic is looking increasingly shaky but having made a public bet, they can’t walk it back. If he does win they will never forgive him. And of course he won’t lose any sleep over it which will just enrage them more.This election increasingly keeps looking more and more like NYC politics done nationally. If Obama is David Dinkins second term then Trump is Giuliani being brought in to clean things up. It doesn’t get much play outside of NYC but the elites hated Giuliani when he was mayor. 9-11 swept that memory out of sight but the elites here in NYC spent most of the 1990s crying for the “vibrancy” of the 1970s. All the normal people were happy to see the bums vanish and property values rise.

        So, why did this half-wit Kennedy spawn trustifarian out GHWB_?  My guess is that we need look no further than middle school for her motivation: “Hey, all the cool girls are supporting our Hillary, you should too_!  (Otherwise you’d have to leave the cool girls lunch table)”.  IOW, they really are that stupid.The better question is why did GHWB even say this, falling in with and supporting her idiocy, even if in semi-privacy_?  His clan will not go unpunished in Texas, I’d warrant.  Does he not know this_?  Son GWB is at least smart enough to keep his mouth shut.  Apparently there is such a strong sense of immunity within the interlocking directorate that is now the Daviousie NGO/foundation world that virtue signaling to each other outweighs any other consideration of status maintenance, like keeping up the pretenses that something other than scratching each others’ backs is going on.In retrospect we have to admire Bill Clinton, the Rodrigo Borgia of our age.  As a teenager he divined that there was such a thing as Elite World and resolved to not just get into it but to own it.  The key was to use his political gifts to gain entry and then get power by working the network of the likeminded, letting them all know about the big payday to come, sling out other people’s money to all and sundry of the likeminded under cover of good intentions, etc. Then repeat on a national, then global scale.  In and out of government, you help them, they help you, even pathetic Kennedy spawn.   Use surrogates like your wife if you must, but whatever else, convince them that you are their best hope to keep the carrousel turning.  He even converged the old Yankee Bush Dynasty.  Wow, just wow_!I think we have a strong clue here to an alternative to repudiating the national debt.  Just as a broke Henry VIII went where the politically indefensible big money in his day was, i.e. the vast Church landholdings mid-reformation, so it should be with NGO’s and foundations in ours.  Start with Soros &amp; son_!

Didn’t ya love how Huma praised Hillary in a snarky hardy-har-har way about manipulating the Egyptians and Libyans. Well. We aren’t them. They better wake up, and soon. I trust they will when Trump wins.

        Jacoby looks and quacks like a progressive, and his column is full of the usual progressive lies and omissions.Some perspective: In 1870, Los Angeles had a population of some 6,000, a village on the edge of a continent in a country just emerging from a savage civil war. China too was emerging from a civil war too (see Taiping Rebellion), and had a population of some 300 to 400 million (as large or larger than the US today). If China was allowed unfettered immigration to southern California, just how long would it be before the white inhabitants of Los Angeles were submerged in a sea of Chinese?  A month, maybe two?Yes, the LA lynchings were savage, and other anti-Chinese acts were repeated up and down the west coast at the time.  But considering the stakes, the fear that motivated these attacks is hardly irrational.

            Some more perspective: less than 30 years later the Boxers of the Boxer Rebellion in China would brutally slaughter well over 1000 Europeans, most of whom were missionaries, their children, and students. They would go on to kill thousands more Chinese who had converted to Christianity. The Boxers make the LA mob, with their 18 victims of their “ghastly eruption of lethal racism” look like a bunch of pikers.
But hey, who needs historical perspective when your point is to compel your readers to self-flagellate in the interest of open borders.

        Gonna be fun to watch the “real liberals” stick the knife in the “neo-liberals” as soon as they get off the bus. Maybe the rest of us will get a party we can support in toto.

        Finally!  Someone who can use the word “neo-con” in a sentence without it sounding like misuse of the word “fascist,” wherein each of these words is actually synonymous with “scary,” “in muscular defense of the United States,” or “controversial” — wherethatone means “something Democrats oppose.”
