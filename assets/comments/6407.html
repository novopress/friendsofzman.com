        Rubio is a mannequin, ventriloquist dummy, ken doll, and sock puppet of the globalist oligarchy.  He’s not smart but good looking and good at memorizing his talking points.  He is the perfect republican answer to Obama, with both advancing the globalist agenda at breakneck speed.  (George Soros is 85/86 after all).  Yes we are doomed if either wins.  On the other hand, this will open up free time for immersing oneself in the past glories of Western Civ.  There will be no need to worry about influencing politics or public policy.

        If it’s Hillary versus Rubio, you gotta vote Hillary if only to punish the Republicans for their inability to listen to their own electorate on the immigration issue.  Also, I think a weak and universally disliked Hillary Clinton would not accomplish much against a Republican Congress.  Republicans would try and stop her at every turn just to earn favor with their base.  If it’s Rubio pushing a statist agenda with a Republican Congress, there would be nobody to stop him.

        Rubio would lose big to Clinton, not only because a good chunk of the conservative base will once again stay home, but because America is not going to elect a guy who looks like an 18 year-old grocery bagger as its President.  If you want to beat the Clintons, you have to be willing to say what has to be said, and Marco just doesn’t have it in him.

        If either of these clowns is President, an American national socialist party is inevitable.  And won’t that be a hoot!  Chateau Heartiste as Culture Kommissar; Rand Paul as gauleiter of Trans-Appalachia.  If you’ve got any historical literacy at all, this is an exhiliratingly stupid time to be alive.  And did you know that, in a pinch, you can use the inside of a banana peel to polish your jackboots?

        I think you are off on the Dem side.  None of the leaks would happen w/o WH knowledge – stakes are too high and Obama manages the left far more than he does the country.  Obama is waiting for the optimal time to purge Clinton &amp; co. Possibly after the Bern wins NH.  Rubio is the GOP plan to package Dubya like Obama – Always behind fashion and the cool kids.  This is the Bern’s true opening and the only plausible path for the left, as if will have a free hand to tap into the mood of anger /outsider.  Rubio will blather about how optimistic he is and spend his tee vee Time on vague platitudes on Liberty and the Horatio Alger myth.  He will say what a great country this is that someone of his background will have a chance to be Prez.  Once again GOP plays the patsy for the corporate class, and Obama smells like a rose for destroying the Clintons.  GOP talking heads whine about how unfair media coverage is and how little credit they are getting for their historic nominee.  Dems call Rubio a race traitor and the Hispanic lobby backs them up.  The Bern recruits fake Indian and they channel the anger into a political revolution.  The SJWs, in full Stalin mode, aren’t going to let the country rest just b/c Obama has to vacate.  Conservatives will believe it is all posturing and then be shocked that a piece of parchment doesn’t develop into a sentient being and put a stop to it.  That’s where the fun really begins…

        Don’t think so. This is Rubio’s high water mark. He is now not only the Establishment choice by default, but way too many  primary voters see it that way. The question of who can best beat Hillary doesn’t cut it anymore. Primary voters want to know who can beat Washington.

        One further downside to a Clinton restoration: Chelsea. Hillary wins and we’ll never hear the end of Chelsea’s greatness, fitness for office, rightness of her succession. Fill in the blanks for yourself. From what I can glean, she’s as entitled, haughty and condescending as mater but with fewer actual accomplishments. We’re doomed.

        I think you’re being short sighted in regards to the courts, especially the circuit courts, where most of the action defending and expanding the state occurs.I think Rubio’s picks would be better for the country since the democrat party has gone full socialist– OK, Hillary is more facist, but I may be splitting hairs.On the SC, which I suppose has become our government’s counterpoint to the EU rulers in Brussels, would you rather have a Kennedy or a Sotomayor? Who knows, with a republican legislature we might even get another Scalia. Given the nature of the MSM hate machine, we might also get another Roberts.It does matter, IMO.It’s probably too late for any conservative to roll back the welfare state, but there are other areas that are still important.

        I don’t see Rubio taking the R nomination. I could easily be wrong, but I’m thinking Trump or Cruz. I favor Cruz myself, but I could vote Trump in the general. Cruz’s Texas senate campaign was a masterpiece against his establishment republican, and this campaign for nomination seems to shaping up similarly. Of course, and sadly, most of the rest of the states are not Texas in any way, shape, manner, or form, so a similar strategy may not work for him.

            I’ve gone back and forth or Cruz. I Like that he is super smart and quite clever politically. I want guys like that on my side. The worry is that he, like so many other Republicans, is not really on my side. His skill at outfoxing the GOP grandees will be turned on my team once he wins office.That said, Trump is too unpredictable to trust he will follow through on anything. I think he is serious about immigration and foreign policy, but otherwise he is a crapshoot. I also think he hates technocrats at a gut level. He has spent his whole life dealing with these petty tyrants in the bureaucracy. I suspect he would not be inclined to follow their advice on most things.I would actually go out and vote for either of them. If it is Marco versus Hillary I stay home. If it is Bernie versus Marco, I’ll carry a sign for Bernie simply out of spite.

                Bernie makes better sense on immigration than most of the RINOS. And Z, I assume that like me, your presidential vote doesn’t really matter? I figure Bernie will fight with Jill Stein for the Hampshire Co MA, vote.And your “dropped a house on her” comment was amusing- and on the day we talked in class about the Wizard of Oz as a populist allegory!

        If Rubio wins New Hampshire, he is most likely the nominee…..
Huh? Whut? 3rd in Iowa and 1st in NH gets him the nomination? How the heck does this system work? What a mess.
Oh well, if Rubio gets the nom, Hillary becomes president and the United States is finished.
Still, Trump’s my man.

            History says you have to win either Iowa or New Hampshire to have a shot. Iowa was Trump’s worst state, but New Hampshire is his best. If he fails there, it’s over for him. If the party pulls the Bootsie over the line in NH, they crown him king.

        If the choice is between Hillary the old white woman and Hillary the young Cuban guy, both with the same policies, what is the point in voting at all?  It’s like in the Soviet block countries where you got to vote for your choice as long as it was from the politburo.  Seems like a waste of time.

        Zman, you’re pretty bold picking Rubio this early, but he is clearly the choice of the GOP establishment.  Hopefully you are trying to jinx him? Let’s hope it works. I’m sure they will resort to election fraud to make it happen; they might have even started with that already. Anyone who bothers to do some digging can discover evidence that Rubio is at least bisexual, or possibly even homosexual in a marriage of convenience. Funny how that seems to be a mandatory qualification for POTUS these days.What do you make of Cruz regarding the “Natural Born Citizen” clause? The GOP-e must be holding Cruz in reserve as a fallback plan in case Rubio is caught in bed with an 8-year-old boy, right? Because legally it seems like a slam-dunk case that he doesn’t qualify as “natural born”…which begs the question, why not shut him down now?

            In the 18th century, the British understanding of being a British citizen was that you were born of a British mother. In fact, that was the commonly held view throughout Europe before the concept of citizen was even known. Citizenship was heritable. Unless someone can find where the Founders cooked up a land based definition, I think you have to assume they held the same view of “natural born citizen” as everyone else at the time. Therefore, Cruz and Obama are natural born citizens, assuming their mothers were citizens.The issue with Obama and Cruz, I think, is if they were ever citizens, as adults, of another country. Then maybe you can say they gave up their citizenship, but I’m not even sure that’s a valid claim.

                The British were, and remain, Subjects, not Citizens.The Founding Fathers of the United States drew a clear distinction between the status of being a Citizen and a natural born Citizen. A person could become a Citizen of the United States by following a naturalization process, which Congress was granted authority to establish, or by being a Citizen of one of the United States at the time the Constitution was adopted. To qualify as a natural born Citizen a person had to be born to an American Citizen and subject to the jurisdiction of the American government at birth, which meant in one of the United States or in a Territory of the United States.This distinction is made explicit in the language of Constitution itself. Article 1 specifies that being a Citizen of a particular age is the only requirement to hold a seat in Congress–there are no restrictions on how Citizenship is acquired. Article 2 specifies that “No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President.” This distinction in language between the Citizenship status requirements to hold a seat in Congress vs. the Presidency was not a mere oversight–one of the biggest concerns of the Founding Fathers was that one of the European powers would sponsor a Manchurian Candidate for the U.S. Presidency who would owe his loyalty to a foreign nation. (Sound familiar?)The argument that natural born Citizenship is inherited by birth to a U.S. Citizen regardless of the physical jurisdiction in which the birth takes place is absurd. The absurdity of the argument can be demonstrated by simply projecting through time. If a child born on foreign soil to a U.S. Citizen qualifies as a natural born Citizen then, logically, so does that child’s children, and their children, and so on throughout time without regard to where they were born (or where they reside). This rule would render persons with no geographic ties or temporal ties to the United States eligible for the office of President. This is PRECISELY what the Founding Fathers sought to avoid by including the “natural born Citizen” phrase in Article 2 of the Constitution.Ted Cruz is NOT eligible to hold the office of President of the United States. (Whether the Supreme Court would hear a challenge is a separate question.)

                    This is precisely my understanding. Ann Coulter makes the case against Cruz, and it seems convincing.“The phrase “natural born” is a legal term of art that goes back to Calvin’s Case, in the British Court of Common Pleas, reported in 1608 by Lord Coke. The question before the court was whether Calvin — a Scot — could own land in England, a right permitted only to English subjects.The court ruled that because Calvin was born after the king of Scotland had added England to his realm, Calvin was born to the king of both realms and had all the rights of an Englishman.It was the king on whose soil he was born and to whom he owed his allegiance — not his Scottish blood — that determined his rights.Not everyone born on the king’s soil would be “natural born.” Calvin’s Case expressly notes the children of aliens who were not obedient to the king could never be “natural” subjects, despite being “born upon his soil.” (Sorry, anchor babies.) However, they still qualified for food stamps, Section 8 housing and Medicaid.Relying on English common law for the meaning of “natural born,” the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held that “the acquisition of citizenship by being born abroad of American parents” was left to Congress “in the exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution to establish an uniform rule of naturalization.” (U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark (1898); Rogers v. Bellei (1971); Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015), Justice Thomas, concurring.)A child born to American parents outside of U.S. territory may be a citizen the moment he is born — but only by “naturalization,” i.e., by laws passed by Congress.
