        Progress (hah) on gun rights was made because the NRA transformed itself from a sporting group to a political action outfit. The NRA unreservedly supported liberal D’s like John Dingell if they voted pro-gun.  So expansion of gun rights came from the gun owners’  movement, not the conservative movement. Same thing with homeschooling.

            That’s another good one, home schooling. They were treated like lepers by the “movement” until they started winning.

        “Conservatism” has no meaning because it has no philosophy. I don’t mean you have to read Aristotle in Greek or anything, but you should at least be able to answer the question: “what is a governmentfor?”  Nobody in Conservative Inc. has any idea, and that’s why the Left wins — their philosophy is retarded and evil, but it’s coherent, and they pursue it relentlessly.

                Same here.  Jonah Goldberg used to go on about “anti-state” conservatives vs. “anti-Left” conservatives.  But the latter is incoherent.  Being “anti-Left” just means you’ve got a passing familiarity with basic math, elementary logic, and a firm grip on the tautology that words mean what they mean.  Facts and logic aren’t “conservative,” they justare.Conservatism is a philosophical and political response to a set of facts.

        Brit Charlie Cooke, of Oxford and all that, rolled over here to seek his fortune in 2011.  Just what the NRO needed – another America-envying Brit to write sour little snark to round out their Wonder Bread and Skippy selves.
Ponnoru.  Cooke.  Diversity quota settled.

            NR apparently needs a writer with a British or British-like accent. Cooke plays that role after the defenestration of John Derbyshire and Mark Steyn. Either that or he won their Oscar Wilde Lookalike contest.

        “These claims fall into three categories: Nonsense, fantasy and inconsequential.”  Just for curiosity’s sake: into which category does “the restoration of the right to keep and bear arms” fall?  Because I know for sure that in the last 40 years, I have experienced a REAL expansion of my right to keep and bear arms.  When I was a kid, I knew NO ONE who carried a pistol, because it was effectively illegal.  My uncle kept one secretly in his truck, but that does not count, because he was violating the law.  For the last eight years, I have carried a pistol EVERY DAY.  That is not real progress toward liberty?  Oh well, I guess I am living in a fantasy land.

            You bring up a good point that I wanted to address, but I ran out of time. The 2A victories, in my opinion, are largely due to a rejection of the Frank Meyer fusionism Buckley embraced. Gun nuts like myself never let party politics get in the way. If you were pro-gun, you had my support. The NRA backed Bernie Sanders simply because he was pro-gun. Buckley conservatives would argue that single issue advocacy was counter-productive, even when it worked.Guns are a great example of Professional Conservatives taking credit for things that just happened without them. All the states that expanded concealed carry, for example, did so often in opposition to big foot conservatives in Washington. Michael Barone opposed Florida’s concealed carry in the 80’s, for example. You may not remember that time, but there was quite a bit of hysteria back then over what Florida was doing. The Buckleyites sat on their hands for the most part.What do you carry?

                You’re right — the concealed carry movement was largely a state-level issue, but there were national politicians who embraced it.  Granted, most of the pols in that category I can think of are only from the last decade (e.g., Cruz, Palin, Matt Shea, Mike Lee, etc).  And, you’re right again, many big-foot national conservatives either oppose it (e.g., Bill Bennett) or are late to the 2A party (e.g., Rush Limbaugh).  I never heard where Bill Buckley himself stood on the 2A, but he was pretty Yalie, so I’m thinking he either never thought about it or opposed it.I carry a Kel-Tec in a pocket holster when I need to deep-conceal, but normally, I carry a Glock 19 with fiber-optic front sight and Dawson back rear sight, in an inside-the-waistband hybrid holster.  I shoot IDPA with the same rig, so I get practice shooting it under pressure, from cover, etc.

        I’m not to sure about your conclusion.  I think some of the Progressive “hooting about men in dresses” is an effort to distract us while they do in fact pull the roof down.  Looking under the hood of Sanders’ and Clinton’s economic proposals is pretty damn scary.  And much of their rhetoric involves a complete disregard for the Constitution and rule-of-law.
If American politics turns into cat-fights between different flavors of big-government progressives (i.e. Trump vs. Sanders), that roof isn’t going to stay up long.

            Sanders stands out because he like a man from a previous century compared to the typical lefty. He cares about economics, while the modern lefty cares mostly about moral signalling. Clinton is not decorating her website with homosexual symbolism by accident. She hardly ever talks about economics and then only in vapid platitudes. She’s not as vacuous as Obama, but she is not as smart as Obama either. Hillary is quite stupid. The point here is Progressivism stopped being a serious intellectual movement when the Soviets collapsed. Now it is just weird outfits and t-shirt slogans.As far as “politics turn(ing) into cat-fights between different flavors of big-government progressives” that’s been the case since anyone reading this has been alive.

        it seems to me that there was a contradiction at the heart of Buckley’s conservatism that doomed it to failure.  As I understand it, Buckley wanted to oppose the Soviets abroad, and the FDR state at home, because he understood them to be two sides of the same coin.  The problem of course, is just how are you to effectively oppose the Soviets abroad unless you maintain an FDR state at home, with all the military and national security appurtenances?Buckley deserves some credit for helping to bring down the Soviets, although less than his acolytes allow.  But the FDR state ate his lunch, to the ironic extent that many of his supposedly loyal followers are now members and defenders of it, yet remain oblivious to the fact.

        I’m still thinking about NR and other Conservatism, Inc. hostility towards Trump, my impression is that they understand they can’t bring Trump down but are threatening any Professional Conservative that’s shows sympathy towards Trump and his positions that deviate from neocon orthodoxy, they’re pushing Cruz as their Plan C right now, he is smart and can keep Neconservatism alive in Washignton for a few more years.

        Young folks.  Socialism is a failure every time it’s attempted.  Socialism is BORING and unoriginal!  But, a truly conservative government has never, ever existed in modern America, or the world.  If they really want to think of themselves as radical, they should think outside the box a little harder.
