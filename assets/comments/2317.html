        From your previous post, I think Sailer is correct that successful (and ambitious) minorities tend to gravitate toward alliances with the ruling class. This condition can be true whether they operate clandestinely or fearlessly in the open.“[W]e have spent most of our history as a vulnerable minority … That is why Jews both value and insist upon multicultural societies where the rule of law prevails, where distinctive identities can flourish, and where tolerance and respect are values equally applicable to all citizens.”— Abraham Foxman, Ha’aretz, February 13, 2006It seems the most sensible answer to “Why are Jews predominantly liberal?”, even in Israel, is that liberalism has proved to be a good strategy for ethnic survival. A host society that tolerates or promotes progressive change and diversity, and aggressively pursues universal equality, will be a comfortable place for a group that has been a traditional target of persecution. This idea lends credence to the argument that Jews are not only along for the ride but actively help drive the leftward tilt of modern politics and culture.This same entrenched, politically savvy self-protection prevents the rest of us from asserting our right to sane immigration priorities as our “rule of law” also moves to the left. If the Muslims are expelled or prohibited entry then the Jews are next on the list, or so goes the fear.Lawrence Auster on the subject:http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/024334.html

        “A host society that tolerates or promotes progressive change and diversity, and aggressively pursues universal equality, will be a comfortable place for a group that has been a traditional target of persecution.”
This explanation resonates with me, but I would not for a moment cede the high ground of “progressivism” to today’s Leftist Democrat Party, which the majority of American Jews support without fail.  The growing intolerance of the Left in this country towards those who disagree with its political and social orthodoxy is a danger that should not be ignored.

        The Merriam-Webster definition of bigotry is itself bigoted and serves as a wonderful example.  Funny that.
Howizzit that we have no dictionary or thesaurus of our own?  I fear we will not win on any battlefield the left chooses until we do.
