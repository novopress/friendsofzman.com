        enforcing Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act as intended puts a halt to the most egregious violations of our rights
This is the case with most problems – lack of enforcement of what is already on the books.  But as recent experience confirmed – it’s not who votes that counts, it’s who counts the votes.  Likewise, laws don’t matter, who enforces laws is what matters.

        I agree with a lot of what is written here, but Z has Section 230 exactly backasswards. The publisher responsible/platform not responsible was a judge-created distinction BEFORE Section 230 was written, and Section 230 was written precisely to remove from Big Tech any legal responsibility for censorship that they might have if proven to be publishers.  Go, ahead, read it: 47 U.S. Code § 230 – Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material :https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable…” Got that? “No provider”, whether platform OR PUBLISHER is liable for any censorship of anything [whatever it thinks is] “objectionable”. There’s a “good faith” requirement, but it’s unenforceable.

        One basic tenet of conservatism is that there is a transcendent moral truth. That means it is indifferent to the marketplace. it also means that truth itself is not up for bid.
That’s true but the problem is admitting the legitimacy of the transcendent. Unfortunately, a lot of “conservatism” like liberalism consists in denying the legitimacy of it.

        All of these 501(c)(3) orgs that hardly anyone has heard of act as a feedback mechanism to provide the 1% with both a tax shelter and a lobbying group to preserve their interests. (And of course a six-figure salary to the “thanks dads/moms” that have never done a working-class job in their lives.)

        This ad for a Kryptonite bike lock is amusing for how she low-key informs you that it won’t work if you live around blacks.   But it still works great around whites.

            Looks like more a junkie thing than black thing, IMO.
Seattle/Portland/Oakland have problems in this area (no prosecution for minor theft + bike riding urban population = free money for thieving junkies).

            My bikes are not cheap and each is customized for specific riding conditions &amp; preferences. I lock them routinely and have never had one stolen as yet (knock on wood). I also lock them where they are highly visible and I can keep an eye on them when I seated in a food place. Last, and most importantly, CC ups your situational awareness and you can often spot a potential theft casing your bike before the act.

                I have read enough of your comments TomA to say honestly I fear you might be looking for a fight under the pretext of leaving your bike out where it would attract attention and waiting to catch a thief.
Don’t be that guy.  A prison sentence for standing your ground as you wrestle armed with your CC with a meth addict over a bike is going to really suck.  You are pretty much 100% the guy they are talking about when they talk about “Red Flag” laws.

                    Not really. I would only ever use a firearm in self-defense or hunting (excepting target practice of course). And a firearm should only be drawn if you’re serious about using it, so never wave one around as a threat either. And I agree that bike theft is no excuse to shot anyone, so we’re not so different as you think.As for my comment above, I was trying to make the point that you can, and should, try to protect anything of value to you by being vigilant and serious, and not so much relying solely on a mechanical device. As to the CC issue; if you’ve never carried, you likely don’t know how it effects your state of mind. And as the crazy increases in the months ahead, you would be wise to carry more often than not. LEOs will not be there when you need one, so you must rely on yourself.

                    Good thing TomA lives in the mountains in Montana or something. Less hobos and diversity to deal with out there 😉
However if I ever hear a story about an “incident” from the Rockies I’ll be sure to check here next day.

        I have to wonder if a conservatism based on truth is even possible in our society
I would think that truth is more compatible with a society based on honor, and didn’t we say that honor is the basis of an aristocracy
We live in a big department store or mideast bazaar, and that’s the truth

        One thing I’ve noticed is how easily “conservatives” are led by the nose by the simple means of invoking one of their cherished, usually leftist-derived “principles.” I guess that’s part of the “Big Con.”There was an article a couple days ago inspiring outrage across the conservosphere about how American university was establishing black-only dorms. Of course, the conservatives were activating their egalitarian and DR^3 triggers condemning this “racism.”I felt compelled to mention “Why do you care? All the other dorms will be better for having fewer blacks in them. Look to your own people.”Oh, yeah. Well, that. I got no pushback because it’s an iron rule, whether liberal or conservative — Whites run from black majority schools as fast as their little feet can carry them. There’s literally no reason they should be opposed to fewer blacks in the dorms where their precious kids will be living, and when forced to think about that, they *know* it’s true.

            I remember my philosophy 101 professor, who was kind of an oddball, but he said something that always stuck with me. Basically, don’t expect professors to ever challenge the status quo because most of them come from the middle class and are not made to be iconoclasts, they are here for the steady job, despite any intellectual pretensions or conceitsI think this carries over to most of our society.  It might be a mistake to assume that the typical normie con would ever put his neck on the line for anything because he’s just not built that way.  He’s built to be a yes-man and a conformist.  Challenging the status quo in any way shape or form is just not in the cards.Like I sad long ago when I first started posting here.  Maybe we are all there is and ever going to be to the dissident right.  A small niche faction of men, generally,who have more guts than the average Joe and who put truth above much else even if to our personal and financial detriment.  Being DR asks quite a bit of the person. And how many people like us can there ever be?

                True, they’re pure cowards who would eat a thousand dicks for that annuity check (that will be vaporized by around 60% during the coming inflation).  You would need an event that causes a large swath of them to lose everything, and even then, most of them will be cowards who follow the next con artist who gains traction.  My belief is that the American, 1950’s middle class was a fleeting moment based on events of the time, and most people, even whites were always meant to be poor peasants, with blacks meant to be neolithic jungle people.  Not necessarily because the system makes them poor, it does, but because they’re ignorant, dim witted and make terrible life decisions.  Buying the new margarita machine over proper dental care. Etc.

                Your prof was a fool or a liar. While it’s true that the professors–at least after the AWRs conquered academia–don’t want to change the university very much, it is equally true that they worked tirelessly to destroy the status quo that used to be America. Needless to say, they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.

                    Point well taken, Ostei, but that’s also along the lines of what he meant.   The “leftists” are just middle class hacks who see financial stability in creating a new status quo.  If there were no such thing as tenure, and they didn’t have the protections of tenure, they wouldn’t be so bold.  There is no real risk in anything they do.  In fact it’s sanctioned by the government.The point he made was about taking risks and putting your neck on the line, challenging the orthodoxy, etc.  These leftists would NEVER do that.  Let’s see one of them challenge BLM or was have you.

                        That is true. The intellectual war they’ve waged on white people poses no risks to them. In fact, all of the risk resides with those rare professors who oppose that war. They lose their jobs and have their careers wrecked by doing so.

                In defense of being afraid to be an iconoclast: even in normal times, speaking out can easily cost you your position, your career, even your social circle. Many, perhaps most, professors are NOT tenured and thus subject to dismissal for the slightest misstep. How much more so, then, those who lack any security of their position? These people have at the very least their own income to consider. Often they have families reliant upon them too. In these abnormal times, the persecution is getting worse.I hope we don’t end up with needing to avoid being the first to stop clapping after Comrade Stalin’s speech, but it seems we are adrift on those waters. 🙁

                I don’t see how anyone who has ever worked in an organization can be optimistic about our side of the divide rebelling whether for Secession or general pushback until things are so bad they have no choice.In corporations I saw  behavior that would remind me of Samuel Johnson’s statement that he was always amazed by “man’s propensity to stoop to meet the situation.”If there was even the slightest risk of a downside nearly everyone would be willing to toss another worker into the volcano to satisfy the corporate God. At the very least they would never come to the defense of someone being treated unfairly. A sizable minority would go out of their way to hurt a coworker if doing so provided them the slightest possible advantage.We are not a cohesive culture of warriors. We are a nation of sheep.

        Clarity once again. A memetic war is raging. It’s aim is indoctrination of the masses with a covert mindset that serves the interests of Progressive Elites and the Deep State. Hired pens are mercenary warriors at the front lines; and yes, they do tangible harm by proxy. When you infect society’s brain with a an artificial meme virus, lots of extreme derivative consequences will follow.For example, an old man walking down the street is blindsided with a vicious punch to the head and his brain is scrambled. An old woman tending a flower bed on the street is similarly &amp; brutally punched in the head from behind by random attacker. A retired doctor, his wife &amp; grandchildren are shot dead in cold blood because he refused to prescribe painkillers to an addict. A four year boy is dragged from his home, stabbed to death &amp; left on the street by drug addled burglar. There is a common denominator to these horrors, and it begins with the moneymen who finance these propaganda campaigns and care not who dies as a consequence.Our society has a serious disease, and it’s getting worse, not better. That must change.

            We are not allowed to have a memory about the past crimes.  Who remembers the Colton Hinant kid who got shot in the head for being white.  The number of stories like that I have read over the last 20 years is huge.  We are not allowed to remember or state our grievances or experiences.  But black people are actively encouraged to remember and document even minor affronts.I do not know of even one example where a white person has flat out mercilessly killed a black child for no reason but I can give you numerous recent examples of where this has happened the other way around and yet we are supposedly the oppressors.It’s pure lunacy.  Like Emmet Till was killed yesterday and we are all stuck staring at the body forever.  History never progresses.  It’s just an eternal racial grievance were we are not allowed to speak frankly about our own experiences of these people and why we think things are the way they are.  A totally one sided conversation.

                    B125:  I differ in considering them to ‘have a different mind.’  I consider them (and science largely bears out my belief) a separate and distinct subspecies.  They have different genetic origins (Denisovan not Neanderthal) and had different environmental influences.  They are not homo sapiens sapiens, and to attribute a ‘soul’ to creatures utterly without mercy or empathy or abstract thought is a category error.
tl;dr:  They are not fully human.  I fully expect the down votes and I fully stand by my opinion.

                        Biologically speaking I can not agree.  The fact we can interbreed seems to confirm that, and there are at least a talented 10% who are capable of acting White.  You don’t need to attribute a subspecies status to explain what average IQ differences can adequately cover.  They are fully human, just on average, not as smart, and that translates into aggregate behavioral differences and culture.

                    Case in Point:  LeBron James tweeting “They be out here hunting us everyday” after the Ahmed Arbury shooting, which was the most egregious example lately  of a complete lie built on the foundation of the lie of Ahmed being merely an innocent jogger.
Like some kind of eternal present tense.  Which is why reparations are meaningless.  They will only ever live in the historical pain of their ancestors anyway because they refuse to consider that today is actually not exactly the same as yesterday.

            “…A memetic war is raging. It’s aim is indoctrination of the masses… Hired pens are mercenary warriors at the front lines…”We are already in the post-literary age. We don’t need yet another wordy journal that few will read.The leftists are winning this battle, partly because they reduce their message to simple slogans and repeat them constantly. The esoteric ramblings in “Foreign Affairs” are of no interest to the masses. Shouting “Social justice!” and “Black lives matter!” is all that’s needed.To win the “meme war”, we also need a simple message. We need popular, hard-to-attack slogans. We need well designed posters. We need short talking points to back them up. Then we need to promote them everywhere.

Drives the “BLM” people crazy, like “All Lives Matter”. Not easy to attack like “White Lives Matter”. Appeals to any group which values “civilized life”, as opposed to violence and degeneracy, etc.
I’m sure there are talented folk who could do even better…

                        Tom: “Reality Matters” is a good slogan, but is more philosophical than political, and would only invite pointless debate with the “critical theory” crowd on what is “real”, etc.
By focusing the debate on “civilized life”, we can bring up realities regarding crime rates, marriage and family, education, work ethics, etc.

                They are not winning because of memes or catchy slogans.  They are winning because if you don’t give in, they will burn your city with no repercussions to themselves or their cause. In fact, it only strengthens it.
The same reason muslims in Europe get away with murder.  Because they can.

        The AWRs had no qualms about coopting and hijacking capitalism for their own purposes, even though most of them professed hatred for capitalism. “Conservatives,” on the other hand, are too principled to sully their hands with state power as a means of rolling back the destruction of free speech. That, in a nutshell, is why the AWRs won, and the Right lost.

            Ostei:  As Zman has stated, Capitalism is not a religion.  Anytime I see issues of the day framed in terms of capitalism/communism, I know I’m dealing with civnat fools.  There’s one particular website I skim, at which I’ve found some interesting links/memes, but they are absolutely obsessed with killing ‘communists.’  Yet never a scintilla of a thought of the Jevv question or the race question, because we’re all part of the ‘human race.’  Except commies.  Utterly useless drivel.

                Our enemies aren’t communists.  They do not want the proletariat to own the means of production.
People cling to this inaccurate term because they want to fight an ideological/economic war but they are in a race war.
Many will say that if we are not fighting communism then we are fighting socialism.  However, most people have some socialist preferences.  Unless you are willing to let poor children die when charities fail, for example, then you are some kind of socialist.

                    Well in the “attention economy” which is Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc… yes, our overlords very much want the non-white masses to own the means of production, i.e. the culture.  That’s why Joy Reid notoriously exclaimed from her MSNBC perch that “we” (meaning her friends) own the culture and Trump supporters are domestic terrorists.
You are thinking of the means of production being some kind of olden days factory.  You are correct in that nobody cares about those anymore.

                    Line – Yes.  These are people who refuse to accept we live in a demographic age.  They refuse to accept the reality of race, period.  The website I’m referring to is Western Rifle Shooters, of course.  I know they read here, because I’ve seen links to Zman posts there.  As I said, I scan their stuff, some of which is useful, but they have this enormous mental block.  It is/was visible in Matt Bracken’s fiction books, readable as they are.  This blind insistence that only ideology and ‘principles’ matter, not race, makes reading them and many of their links an enormous exercise in frustration.  I’ll be reading some solid sentences, fully aware of the war against us the government is waging, and then where the genuine thinking dissident would put ‘blacks’ they put ‘communists.’  You just cannot reform older boomers, and I don’t know how useful all their verbal bluster and genuine military experience will be when they refuse to recognize racial reality which is at the root of everything.

        Notice in that article that the word “monopoly” only appears in the comments section, that the Federal Trade Commission is never mentioned, and a fleeting sentence in the conclusion explains why these companies can’t be broken up, without any supporting facts or evidence.   The biggest con in libertarianism is the “natural monopoly.”  While this article never brings that up, it adheres to it.  If something is indeed a “natural monopoly” then it’s by nature a public good and should be either nationalized or heavily regulated from top to bottom.

            Yeah – these guys talk like constantly rearranging our life to escape the problems of being jacked over is just one of the wonders of the free market.
Here’s an idea: we hire some thugs to threaten our digital oppressors with prison if they don’t stop oppressing us. We can call them the FTC. Which would be more efficient? We hire a couple hundred guys and buy them guns and badges or 350 million people spend a month looking to solve their digital overlord problem?
See? We discovered a more efficient solution! The wonders of a free market.

        I read the American Conservative occasionally but find it sprinkled with not so conservative content, like it was hijacked. I read American Thinker more often but find the same there although not as bad.It’s hard to find consistent good middle brow content so I stick to sites like this for the good stuff.I also like Counter-Currents even though it’s a paywall for some content now.I still read or watch mainstreamers like Victor Davis Hanson and Pat Buchanan and even Bill Whittle on occasion but all the civic nationalism stuff just ain’t gonna work anymore.

            I’ve taken to reading VDH’s historical comparisons as mordant humor these days. “When the Thracian dictator Numimicles undermined the culture and customs of the people he claimed to represent as recklessly as Nancy Pelosi does now, things ended badly.”

                VDH has been a bright candle in a dark bleak dungeon these days.  I like his writing.  Obviously he’s totally mainstream but pretty fun to listen to anyway as he gripes about things.  I hate how the people on Fox News who interview him always cut him off.

                Exactly. I find the whole “when will white people rise up?” whining very tedious. Nobody is stopping YOU from acting in your own best interest. White people do it all the time but you don’t hear about it because whites tend to be smart enough not to whip out a camera phone, record it, and upload it to Twitter for future prosecution.“One need not have an actual conspiracy to achieve the practical effects of a conspiracy. More regimes have been brought, piecemeal, to their knees by what was once called “Irish Democracy,” the silent, dogged resistance, withdrawal, and truculence of millions of ordinary people, than by revolutionary vanguards or rioting mobs.” – James C. Scott

                    There is this thing where stuff just stops working. I was reading the story about the French defeat in 1940. What was interesting is that the high command seemed pretty competent and the French equipment was not inferior to the Germans’. But the Republic had so hollowed out the institutions of the country that the army simply couldn’t do army stuff – they couldn’t implement a withdrawal, a redeployment, a pivot to cut off a breakout, nothing.High command was shocked that an army that had fought like demons at Verdun could no longer fight at all. It had been hollowed out from the inside.

                        The reason is that countless alphas died on the fields of the Somme, Passchendaele, Verdun and elsewhere. Europe is still paying the price of that mechanized slaughter machine and the demise of a generation of its most dominant &amp; courageous males. Our DNA based legacy will rebuild this resource if we first restore the selection pressure that produced dominant males in the natural environment.

        The whole Sec 230 business for me is a smokescreen for the Government outsourcing suppression of free speech to the Tech Oligarchs. The so-called conservative/libertarian mercenary grifters have falsely framed it as a private property, “build your own Facebook if you don’t like it” issue. See Parler to find out how this works out……..The First Amendment says the Government cannot suppress your speech. Private companies, naturally, can do whatever they please. So this is another example of outsourcing: the Government gets Facebook to suppress your speech. Meanwhile, it turns a blind eye to obvious Tech Oligarch collusion to screw Gab and Parler.I’m not sure what the solution might be, but the DR should be completely b**cotting all the major social media sites.

            Yes, Section 230 and the de-facto monopoly of Big Tech is a thorny problem. To put it into 19th century terms that might be easier to understand, even by me with an IT background: Of course the First Amendment still exists. You are free to write and publish your own flyers, newspapers or books. But the problem seems to be that no one will rent you warehouse space, sell or lease you a press, nor supply your paper and ink. Never mind the problem of distributing your periodicals: they don’t exist, and no commercial venture would stock them, under penalty of being cancelled. Viola! Dictatorship by the private sector. No government trampling of rights required.

                Yes, but it’s always been that way. At no point from the ratification of the first amendment to the present has there ever been an assumption of access to public forums or private distribution channels. Moreover, the specific phrasing of the first amendment is that “Congress shall make no law…” This isn’t de facto freedom of speech, it’s simply forbidding the federal government to play a role in regulating it. Free speech has never existed, it was simply a rhetorical trick leftists used to steal the megaphone from traditionalists.

                    Actually I think that they were speaking to the issue of the day which was potential government censoring. Media monopoly control was beyond their reality at the time. In any case as one of the founders said (to paraphrase) that the constitution was written for a moral and religious people. In the totally corrupt situation that we currently find ourselves only power, money and force matter.

                When “private” corporations are in a thoroughly symbiotic relationship with government, the distinction between private and public is no more. This is a key component of classical fascism, of course, and it’s a major feature of replacing America with something very different and much worse.

                        And they don’t protest because they are doing the work the government wants them to do. The big corporations and government have always been in bed, of course, but prior to the 90s, and certainly before the 60s, the relationship was based upon graft. Nowadays, although the financial corruption persists, there is also a political and cultural component. The government–including the Republicans–want the corporations to harm whitey culturally and politically. The corporations are now government’s unofficial cultural propaganda arm, and its censor.

            Captain Willard:  While I was raised on standard civic nationalism, I’ve come to agree with a certain blogger that free speech is a chimera.  It is always and should always be controlled, but it all depends on who sets the standards.  Any future ethnostate would be suicidal if it instituted purportedly ‘free speech.’  That is inviting spiteful mutants (and there will always be some even among Whites) to push for sexual license and rights for non-Whites.A return to White Western controlled-speech and behavior is long overdue.  We could also do with a return of a sense of personal privacy, and of shame.

                    I was going to say that looked like they got infiltrated and converged somewhere along the way, but reading the Wiki page on the Legion (linked from the above link), it looks like the entire Catholic Church got converged and left them behind. Plus the convergence of the public school system that turned children away from traditional morality.

                How about this standard: you get to speak if you pay taxes (that is, you pay in more than you suck out; or if retired, have paid in more than the net present value of what you’re going to take out).
On some level, your rights should approximate your responsibilities.

I’m fine with making the vote contingent on one’s status as a tax leech (I’d also make government employees ineligible to vote, though, due to conflict of interest), but I think speech needs to be approached in a non-economic fashion. We are not economic units and we can’t reduce our entire culture down to economic measures. I don’t have the answer off the top of my head as to how, though.

            Yes, Captain Willard, this is an observation very much to the point. The principle is outlined in this post:https://web.archive.org/web/20201202193807/https://macris.substack.com/p/tyranny-incAt the head of this post are these words: “What government wants to do but cannot, it can require corporations to do for it”.What we seem to be confronted with is not really communism, but fascism in the sense by which Mussolini understood it; i.e., the union of State and Corporations. Mussolini conceived of this union as being beneficial to Corporations, but under the condition that the State held the whip hand through its unambiguous superiority as authors of all laws and regulations, and its monopoly on coercive violence both physical and “legal”. Nowadays, with the Uniparty, the power relationship is less certain owing to the corruption of the politicians and regulatory capture; but the symbiotic relationship of State and Corporations is certainly intact, even if somewhat differently structured and maintained. If socialist organizational principles help in cementing the rule of The Elites, whether governmental or corporate, then they reach for those, but all within an authoritarian framework where coercion can be exercised through  “legal” means or police violence, or through the enforcement of a status of economic pariahdom via cancellation. That’s real Fascism, and nothing less.

        I was a CivNat heading into college. I joined some campus conservative groups and was integrated into the party at the local/youth level. Quickly noticed that it was fully run by homosexuals. The people involved were:– homosexuals– autistic guys with no social skills but who want power– “policy wonks” who like to feel smart and hum and haw to show how smart and superior they are.None of these people actually hold any conservative values, nor do they try and fight for them. It’s just a game where they try and climb the greasy pole to get power. It was a big redpill though.

                The greasy pole smoking status climbers and the feminized culture they propagate works to not only gatekeep any actual normal men of conservative orientation but also to pre-empt the conservative chads from entering any kind of activism.The lispy bow-tie faggotry of campus conservatism is some of the best birth control on the market.Unfortunately that beta thirst model extends well beyond college to become conInc documentary girl fantasy finance, 2A gunslut pinup worship, and foreign bride fetishizing. All dead ends.Meanwhile the conInc and globoCorp joint-ventures pay “up and coming stars” like benjie to larp about the Constitution.And the remnants of budding shitlords end up wasting away selling bonds and Tindering urban libstuts instead of carrying the torch.

        The American Conservative is a bizarre publication.  They regularly post obviously paid for garbage like the piece Zman wrote this column about.  Their most popular contributor is Rod Dreher,  who has a decent understanding of religious liberty but otherwise is an emotive fool who gets gaslight by the left all the time.  He loves denouncing anyone who even mildly promotes a positive white identity.  Their comment section is almost overrun with urban liberals, why they are reading “The American Conservative” is anyone’s guess.Then they will on occasion publish something very good that it is shocking could get on a publication like this.  Along side this column today is one by Emma Freire.  She is a writer who moved back to the United States after eight years of living in South Africa and Brazil.  She gives confirmation to what many on this side have been saying for years, that our society is devolving become more like these basket case nations using blunt examples. Hopefully she can help wake up some whites.https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/coming-back-to-america-observations-after-eight-years-abroad/

            Dreher is the most craven cuck imaginable. He pretends running and hiding is principled. I don’t think he is gaslighted as much as realizes accepting leftwing premises is tge path of least resistance, the sort of thing National Review does.

                David French is worse, but Dreher is bad.  Here is a good example from a few years ago.  There was a fire that was determined to be arson at a Mosque in Houston, Dreher responded with this hand wringing piece about “fighting religious bigotry” and sanctimoniously sent the Mosque $50 to help them rebuild.  A few days later, someone got around to reporting the truth, the fire was started by a vagrant trying to keep warm and only caused some damage to a storage building.  When called out on his donation, he was defensive, calling it a gesture of goodwill.  Hard to believe he thinks he could guide a movement to stand up to the forces trying to tear down Christianity.

                    If push came to shove, Dreher would gleefully assist the totalitarianis in destroying the last vestiges of Christianity and then offer up his wife and daughters to celebrate the victory. French, who is mentally ill, would just watch.

                    David French poses as a conservative evangelical (his twitter picture used to be a portrait of John Calvin) yet he would regularly gush about “Game of Thrones” when it was on air. That was about 5 years ago. Now the norm for TV is that any program not explicitly aimed at young children will have soft-core pornographic content/nudity. Super-Calvinist David French is entirely silent about this sort of thing.

When WoW came out, I was appalled that Blizzard would ruin the franchise with something like an MMO (I barely knew what that was). I tried it about a month after release, and the first night I couldn’t figure out how to change the camera angle, so I ran around the Night Elf starter zone yelling at the screen because I just had a top-down view. I was such a noob that it took me to level 40 to realize that I could get rid of the starter gear, and I wondered why everyone LOLed at my toon. Heck, I didn’t even know about talent points until level 30.

                    I’d found his “crunchy con” twist appealing at first: a conservative who thinks that the country shouldn’t be paved over.  However, it turned out that it didn’t work as a stand alone tenet and his writing on the subject was extremely dry and evasive since, for example, conserving the countryside would seem to also imply conserving the people that are living there too, and we can’t have that now can we.

            It is a strange site. I know one person involved is pretty much a paleo. Then there are others who strike me as commissars. Then you have goofballs like Dreher. People forget that he has hopped from one cut to the next. He was once something called a crunchy-con, for example. At one time they had Ron Unz running the place.
We really need a decent middlebrow publication that advocates our interests.

                Dreher also periodically changes his religion along with his Conservatism-of-the-week. My favorite Dreher moment was when he referenced human biodiversity and commented he gad not read the science about IQ and race and did not intend to do so. Along with bliss, ignorance is the path of least resistance in that area.
Both Dreher and French are mentally ill, full stop.
If you ever decide to publish a midbrow DR magazine I’m fully onboard.

                    As an aside because I find it hilarious, no matter how nutty Dreher got, he always was welcome at National Review. Then he turned against the Neocons (again, it had become fashionable at that point to go after the rat bastards) and suddenly National Review sent him into exile. Too many NR donors are invested in MIC and AIPAC, to the extent tge two are distinguishable

I have not looked at the numbers since last year, but this site was getting over 300K unique visitors a month. Counter-Currents gets 500k. Conservative Inc. has a million ways to sell a donor, while we have none. A professional journal of opinion on a show string that gets a lot of traffic could be a starting place. Another proof of concept.

                But then what purpose do publications like that serve in the power structure?  The Federalist is another one that seems to be financed by some rich people to sort of astroturf talking points for the globalists.  The Left has publications like that too, e.g. Vox and Mother Jones.So here’s how I see those publications functioning in our political system:1.  Dumbed down versions of papers that lobbyists and Think Tanks write in order to make it seem like there is momentum behind an idea.2.  Places for rich people’s kids to work where they are shielded from having to look for a real job but still add some value to the family business.3.  A place to meet young women who are ideologically correct for rich “conservative” guys.4.  A pipeline to journalists who need easy access to “Sources”.5.  Draft versions of segments that later get edited and re-written for Fox News.The last thing they are doing, in my opinion, is inviting a dialogue or encouraging real people to share an opinion.For me, a Dissident publication with a middle brow audience would end up being Taki Mag, which we already have.  But unlike how the leftists build organizations to amass paid followers who run the organization, there isn’t any kind of paying job I could get promoting Dissident ideas.  The fact that an activist Billionaire can set up an organization (not for profit) and then hire hundreds of fanatical left-wing women, gays, black people, and Jews to work there is extremely influential.  We don’t have anything like that in the Dissident right.  The reason we don’t is that it used to be the case that all the white guys had all the good paying jobs so these kinds of organizations were a kind of alternative career for the marginalized.  But now all the white guys are truck drivers and suchlike so the fact that there are no alternative careers for us just leaves us powerless and unrepresented.  Which is of course the goal.

                What are your thoughts on Roger Kimball, who us the editor of The New Criterion.  He seems a mix of old-school intellectual/academic — a haunt of the NYC-NorthEastern intellectual crowd.  I enjoyed his earlier commentary, as he at least seemed to have a clear grasp of history and human folly.  But I was surprised at the positions he began to set out early in the Trump (campaign) period.  He seemed to be advocating things more palatable to dissidents than to the NYC cocktail circuit crowd.

            Barnard:  Dreher is a useless cuck who continually apologizes for Whites’ existence.  I went and read Freire’s article and some of the comments – what drivel.  All she notices upon returning to the US after 10 years abroad is mail and customer service? Not one word about immigration or race.  She correctly notes how blase` Americans are about their children, shutting them away with minimum wage non-White ‘daycare’ and in public schools to be taught to be ashamed of their people and history.The comments are about what one would expect from Conservative Inc.  Public life in America – from concerts to libraries to malls – is to be avoided by decent White people. Build your own private world, because Clownworld wants your children.  Deny it its prey.

            I’m glad you said this because I was just about to post almost the exact same thing.I remember being flat out banned from this site long ago for some very milquetoast type comments regarding the schism between ‘Trump supporters’ and ‘conservatives’. That should tell you everything you need to know about the place right there. I’m not even talking about 3rd rail topics like racial IQ differences, the JQ, etc. Just simply that maybe these –millions– of Trump people are not all toothless hillbillies and see something that should be considered thoughtfully vs. shouted down. Boom— insta-ban for life. LOL! Never went back since as it was clear they were a true Mitt Romney level bastion of hypocrisy.Also re: the comments section, that is the other big tell. It is like reading ‘The Hill’ or the NYT comments section and most of the ‘conservatives’ will either agree with the urban shitlibs or give that sort of ‘gentle resistance’ that allows them to be steamrolled. The entire site oozes with the essence of Cuckservative in the most raw distilled essence of the world.

                    If a site does not allow fairly free speech where people can actually say what they think in response to the articles and other commenters, I do not read it.  And I am perfectly fine with accepting at least the same kind of restrictions of speech you would experience at a dinner party with strangers, where you aren’t just going to intentionally be offensive and weird.  I am fine with some moderation in online speech but of course if you give an inch they will take a mile.

                    Since I appear to have been redpilled for well over a decade, I’ve been banned from a LOT of websites.  In many ways it highlights my growth from newly conservative patriot to racial realist without a country: Gateway Pundit, Breitbart, Conservative Treehouse, and a bunch of others are off limits.  My comments at Amren are regularly censored or removed.  Sailer is hit or miss; depends on my mood (and how caustic my comment is) and his.  I’ve had a few comments removed from Counter Currents.  Many other sites on this side of the divide I used to patronize are no longer extant.I don’t generally protest any of the bans; the websites are not mine and I have no innate ‘rights’ as a voluntary commenter.  But it does cause me to consider such a site’s content as less than fully trustworthy.

                        I’m a frequent poster at ZeroHedge, which claims to have moderation but I’ve rarely noticed any censorship. Of course, many of the comments are very left-field, so perhaps more lucid commentary passes unnoticed. I guess the Feds are amassing quite a file on me. Good for them! 🙂

            Thanks for the link. I thought this was an important point :“This willful ignorance about public schools is an example of the “anarcho-tyranny” of mainstream American parenting. I observe parents micromanaging their children’s behaviour during the relatively short periods of time they spend with them. They relentlessly remind their kids to say “please” and keep yelling “be careful!” or “slow down!” At the same time, these parents show an almost shocking level of disinterest in the most important influences in their children’s lives. If a public school has a good rating, then it must be fine. After all, the parents went to public school themselves and they turned out okay. If a day-care center is affordable and keeps your kid from running under a car, then that’s good enough.”

                Fox New’s Comment section has that problem big time.  You’ll read some story that isn’t really about anything and then half the comments will be like “This started with Trumps lies!” or “That was before Trump killed more people than in every war combined with his covid response” and it’s like Don Lemon from CNN is getting paid by Mitt Romney to post snarky anti-Trump comments in as a side-hustle.  But yeah, as the other two replies note:  the comment sections of every website are either monitored or contributed to by the ADL, the military, the FBI, etc.  It’s not just regular guys sharing their ideas online anymore like it used to be in the 1990s.  It’s a battlefield.  The information space.

            Rod Dreher, hours after the Covington kid was accused of harassing the Indian, had to pipe up and publicly say “Gee this looks terrible.” Couldn’t have waiting until all the facts were in. Never had any respect for him after that. Rod Dreher is what National Public Radio thinks a Christian looks like.

        Do you ever get those “chain emails” that go into some sort of rant that incorporates all the current outrage events that get conservatives on their hind legs? They start listing all these things, then end with some quotes from a civil rights icon or Lincoln his own self. Then the challenge: “How many will have the courage to pass this on?” I’m always surprised at the people I know who fall for this shit.

            Epaminondas:  Never get chain mails, but any reference to Lincoln really is the kiss of death.  Just finished the third book of William Forstchen’s TEOTWAKI series “One Second After” ( I read the first two years ago, didn’t realize there was a third).  Spoiler warning:  It ends with what’s supposed to be a tug-on-the-heartstrings scene at the Gettysburg cemetery, where the hitherto ‘rebel’ independent Whites discover the bureaucrats, politicians, and businessmen who saved themselves at the country’s expense when the EMP attack occurred, and continue to oppress those trying to rekindle a modern and independent life.  Really turned my stomach and ruined my remembrance of the prior two volumes.  No, I’m not going to forgive and hug those who’ve done this to us, and no, we are not ‘fellow countrymen.’

        Yeah I can’t see it being anything more than a grift unless of course Hispanics and Black people end up getting super conservative and not wanting their kids to be raised on tranny globalism.  I find it hard to believe that so many people are streaming across the now open border hoping to pay 70% income taxes and eat vegan and have their kids switch genders.The best way, it seems to me, to get the left to go for the opposite of an idea is for the right to first articulate some value that they can then utterly desecrate.  So, we should out Thunk them by promoting gay mercenaries instead of traditional militaries, free abortion for all with licensing required to have a baby at all, and making same-race marriage totally illegal.  You have to marry a non-white person, preferably a transsexual non-white person.  It’s the law because we are White Supremacists who love non-white trannies.  It’s just who we are.  All sports must be mixed gender and be statistically representative of society as a whole in every position.  Schools must not ever evaluate children’s abilities but rather encourage them to grow emotionally and nothing else.  Shoplifting is liberating property from the evil corporate overlords who stole it.And on and on.  I think we can really win this one guys.  Let’s get creative.  Ultimately our swarthy brethren want to enjoy material culture as first-world consumers.  Well, we need to do everything we can to help them get there and then giggle as the rug is pulled out from underneath them exactly as it was for us.We have to stop trying to make sense.  They use our efforts to explain ourselves against us.

            If the right was serious, the only minority outreach would be blasting hispanic communities with pictures of hispanic tranny kids, black communities with pictures of black kids being sodomized by a gay white dude, and asian communities with academic apartheid propaganda to hit home with admissions discrimination.
They’re going to be either indifferent or hostile to white people, so let’s make them hate the white liberal.

                This would truly be a next level, 4-D chess plan to implement.  Israel does that to Palestine.  They will take over a tv station and broadcast porn, which is of course designed to humiliate and demoralize the Palestinians.Crime hasn’t worked.  IQ hasn’t worked.  Race Realism hasn’t worked.  Nothing wakes up the mass of white people to what is happening.  But putting the consequences of being absorbed into the globalist ideology front and center for Black and Brown people by literally showing them constantly being humiliated sexually and socially as they will be might wake THEM up and then the backlash against white people might ultimately wake white people up.I highly doubt LeBron James is expecting that in the future wheelchair bound black kids are going to be inclusively playing basketball with 6 foot tall transsexual female/males but that’s probably what the NBA will be 20 years from now.  Every pro sport is basically just going to be a version of the special olympics.

                Modern Immigrants (Real Americans) are true globalists. “Conservativism” to pocs and invaders is just one more obscure white problem.Sovereign borders are just economic zones. In fact, they are racist. And racist is a human rights violation. The blue helmets and NGO girls said so.Lines on maps are just economic barriers to gibs. Free movement to optimize personal economics is a human right.The chubby white girls with dreadlocks and welcome refugees open legs at the train station is a microcosm of how they see the land of the free.They have no need or desire to interfere with a people in the fast lane to suicide.Cultures who let their daughters backpack into beheadistan or sell their preteen sex on instagram, turn their sons into girls or pouty basement gamers, are just giant marks for the true “bootstrappers” of the world to con.“Politics” in Clown Country is 100% gibs.Billions get wired back “home”. They come and go, dropping babies on the right side of the passport lotto being paramount.White man laws and rules are for whites to debate while the pocs spawn upstream.They build their own communities and tap into the infrastructure where and when it suits them to protect and then assert their unique interests.I think its white projection to assume they think of us at all beyond what resources they can extract from us before the train reaches the half-built bridge and the reversion to the global mean brings many squeals from the uptown lofts.

            They keep streaming into Canada. You think they actually want to work? Most of the world is a shit hole. They’ll take tranny story hour any day of the week as long as they get welfare and a “decent” apartment. The mindset partly explains why most of the world is a shit hole.
Plus they’re forming enclaves more and more. Wokeness doesn’t necessarily penetrate as far into the hood. They are also fine with abortion. Chinese / Indians abort like crazy.

Look at the countries they come from. They don’t care and aren’t capable of caring. The entire history of their countries is elites raping the country and throwing scraps to the peasants, with better scraps going to the peasants that are on the good side of the current rulers. That’s how they think government works. They’re just hoping for better scraps here.

            AC2, your speculations about the political evolution of non-whites interest me because they put my theories about ethnocentrism to the test.I came to my beliefs fighting for immigration restriction in California.  I used to wonder why non-whites were so supportive of massive immigration and the Democratic Party.  My conclusion was that the non-whites feel a deep ethnocentrism that overrides other economic and social issues, like the ones you mentioned.My belief is that most of the non-whites will instinctively back the legislation and party that they believe will allow their group to dominate the others, even if that domination results in less prosperity.If non-whites go Republican because of economic concerns or disgust with sexual deviants then I will have to abandon my theory.  But I don’t think that I will have to.  We’ll see.

        Conservatism not only is a grift, it’s a failed ideology.
Next up: conservatism has never worked because it has never been done properly.
Sound familiar?

            Heh. I just wrote below that ‘being conservative is quite hard… it requires tough people to implement’ (that was the basic gist). On reading your comment, my statement does indeed appear to be a form of “It just wasn’t done properly”!
Perhaps this highlights the importance of focusing on concrete goals as opposed to deciding what sort of conservative we are?

                It would be interesting to pinpoint when the arguments migrated from concrete proposals to abstract generalities. So we could do it right and all. Snark aside, probably the early Eighties, and even then the rhetoric from Reagan and Thatcher was loaded with abstractions.

        “the author of the AC piece is clearly trying to strike the libertarian position, which is a blend of hiding under the bed and shilling for global capital.”That’s it. Unfortunately, unlike being a liberal in today’s world – or progressive, or a libertarian; being conservative is actually rather hard. The truly conservative type solutions to things also make the most sense; but they require toughness to deploy. Immigration is the classic case: too many iffy foreigners with dubious loyalties? Stop the flow. Deport the troublesome ones as an example. Conduct a few false flags if need be.Way back when I would interface with NPCs about this, they’d ask ‘But where will the money come from?’… Bwhahahaha, no zealot cares about that! Take care of business first and then settle the check later. Perhaps now these same NPCs will continually ask the same question, even as it seems that where the bucks come from no longer matters, we just chalk up a bit more debt for the future or it magically appears. Magic! That’s the answer!

            Austrian economics are quoted about as much as the Bible to allegedly refute non-Progressive positions here. I imagine in the UK Austrian economics have moved into first place.

                Who knows what the talking heads here waffle on about, Mr Dobson. When I last went toThe Guardianthe general theme used to counter non-progressive positions was: ‘This will dis-proportionally affect vulnerable persons’ – which means wogs, ‘stanis, fatties, trannies &amp;c.
I do know that the price of my standard loaf has stayed at a steady £1.80 for four years now, however. Helpful, as it’ll soon be one of the only things I can buy!

            Money is a state of mind when you live under the Rainbow.  All you need to do is learn to wear lip gloss and pick a good song to dance to.
They have shown us over the last few years that whatever people used to think money was, it’s something else entirely now.

            The hermit nation is awful.  Take the Amish for example.  When given the choice to stay secluded or to join our wonderful and diverse utopia, A whopping 5% choose to join our society.
