        “This feels like an inflection point, but what comes next is still a mystery.”Somebody famous said that making predictions is risky, especially about the future. Maybe it was Mark Twain ?But I will stick my neck  out anyway and make a prediction;  the left will double down on the violence and mob intimidation of those with whom they disagree. Expect some folks to get killed by these mobs or by individuals who share their fascist , Nazi / commie goals.Soros, Steyer, Bloomberg, et. al., will increase the millions they now expend supporting any and all left wing groups and left wing propaganda; e.g. paying for the thugs transportation , lawyers, etc.  Expect a greater number of lawsuits to derail any Trump policy.The mystery , IMHO , is how the timid, scared and generally useless Republicans will respond. It is possible, just possible, that the orchestrated and planned Stalinist show trial of Kavanaugh by Schumer, Feinstein, Blumenthal, Durban, et. al., and their fellow Nazi / Stalinist acolytes  may have caused the cohones of the Republicans in Congress to emerge from their lower abdomen.But only time will tell.As for the voting public, I am less sanguine. It appears that about 50% of them will still vote democrat; how they do not see the Stalinist / Hitlerian goals of that extreme, radical group of thugs , the democrats, is actually frightening.This is the real danger; the voters susceptibility to 24/7/365 left wing propaganda and lack of interest in what is really going on.Recall that the Venezuelan voters freely and honestly voted into power Hugo Chavez – that is, for a national suicide. This is the real lesson we must absorb from the Venezuelan experience.

                Or they form a mob in a red state and bunch of them end up dead.  The usual people will scream for gun control.  Normals will applaud the concealed-carriers.

                    Very likely the Soros-funded folks running the mob operations pray to Gaia every day that one of the rioters gets elevated to martyr status by cops or normies defending themselves.

                Getting into a ring, one on one, is brave and putting it out there. So is stepping outside with the guy you disagree with.  Running forward in a crowd to bop someone over the head, and then hiding in that same crowd to avoid identification, is pure chicken crap.

                Yea,  I can.Enforcing communism has worked out very well for Castro and his pals, Kim Jong Un, and for Lenin, Stalin and ALL of his successors up until the time of Gorby (whose grandparents or other near-ancestors were murdered by Stalin during the Great Terror; but hey, ;let’s try “free” communism!!), Tito , the very wealthy family of Hugo Chavez, etc., and probably a few Eastern Bloc former commie bosses still living the high life.Despite the total bullshit of workers rights / workers of the world unite, it’s really all personal. The above, and others, saw a way to gain power. , and influence and basically live like royalty; their  primary motivation.Like those Ponzi Schemes or multi-level marketing schemes, if you get in early and get out in time, you will make a killing. Those SOB politicians that believe they have the smarts to get in/out at the right time, will be all in to form a commie / fascist govt.In fact, living in Miami, FL., and in Spain, are a few good – and very wealthy pals of Hugo Chavez. They did just fine enforcing communism (for everybody else, that is, but not for themselves).Communism is the ideal shtick  for those seeking to enrich themselves and obtain benefits denied to the masses. You have a great story to tell the unwashed and ignorant masses (like those who voted for Obama and will continue to vote for democrats).Most gamblers lose their ass; a very few make a killing because they know how to play the odds.

            Good comment, but with regards to this, “fascist , Nazi / commie goals”,  my advice is less NRO/Jonah Goldberg, more:https://arktos.com/Personally, I have trouble believing that the entire elite class, the economic segment very much included, would sign on to the new-left project purely out of selfless seduction by Frankfurt School, et al ideas, or that they’ve all somehow become “communists”.  I think the evolution of capitalism, seeking one grand, world, integrated market to rule over/profit from, is central to this.  To quote from the movie ‘Network’:“There are no nations….There is no West…. There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multi-variate, multi-national dominion of dollars….There is no America. There is no democracy….We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale. The world is a collage of corporations, inexorably determined by the immutable by-laws of business.”

                    You can be both anti-capitalist and anti-Marxist.  Virtually all of the “right” outside America, back to the French Revolution were explicitly or implicitly so.  See: Alain de Benoist and GRECE, Aleksandr Dugin, Julius Evola, the broad vast interwar European right (for ex. the Conservative Revolutionaries like Spengler, Junger, van den Bruck, Spann, Sombart, etc.), and the traditional Catholics (counter-revolutionaries, Distributists) back to the French Revolution.  Medieval Europe was anti-capitalist, are they bunched in with Nazis/fascists/communists?Even in American “conservatism”, check out Russell Kirk, supposedly a great influence on American conservatism.  He was skeptical of unconstrained capitalism (you couldn’t get many clear policy prescriptions from him). And why not? What destroyed the old rural/small town worlds of America and England he poetically romanticized?

                    Here’s a working idea of mine:The ascendant capitalist classical liberal bourgeoisie overthrew Europe’s Old Order of Throne and Altar.  Monarchs, landed aristocrats, the Church constrained them.  They sought freer markets, and democracy, under which their interests could be furthered via purchased influence.  Now, they are overthrowing nationalism and the West, again to further their interests.Capitalism leads to massive wealth concentration, which leads naturally to plutocracy, as that concentrated wealth is used to veer the state in favor of their interests.  Furthermore, they control media, think tanks, and much else within society (wealth is power, and what one owns, one more or less controls).  Their ultimate result is one vast, global plutocracy, of immensely wealthy mega-elites within gated communities holding power, and the world’s masses, working the plantation, toiling in their sweatshops, beneath them.  See: Brazil.The American right has been essentially bourgeois, individualist, and pro-capitalist (unsurprising, considering our history, and who’ve funded them).  Hence, they’ve done nothing to stand above and reign these forces in.“Cultural Marxist” ideas are valuable to the enriched elite, in greasing the skids toward one, united, world market, under their dominion.The elite do not seem selfless, stupid, or powerless.  Yet, they’ve signed on to the new-left program practically to a man.  Why?

        Zman on civ nats, transcribed:“This is the result of them embracing the morality of the left.  If black people are magic, as the left claims, and their blessing is required, well, then civ nats have to run around finding a magical negro to endorse their stuff.”“There’s good money to be made, if you set up a booth at CPAC, or at these other so-called conservative gatherings, and you hire a black guy willing to take selfies with the attendees, and charge $10.  “Get your selfie with the black conservative!  Get a signed autograph with the black conservative!”  Most of the people there, they would be willing to hand over their wallet and car keys for the chance to be endorsed by the magical black conservative.”LOL, classic stuff.  I’m sure Based Black Man will rise and save the day in Detroit, Atlanta, Haiti, Zimbabwe, etc. any day now.

        I strolled through a few Tea Party rallies.  The calmest, friendliest gathering I’ve seen outside of a church picnic.  There were a few leftists counter-protesting around the edges – nobody bothered them in the least.

            Can confirm.  I attended many Tea Party rallies in the San Francisco Bay area.  They left the rally location cleaner than when they arrived, every time.  Salt of the Earth.
That the Tea Party was so ruthlessly commandeered by GOP charlatans was one of the motivations for the radicalization of people like me.  These sweet, gullible people had their authentic movement ripped out of their hands in the service of some short term marketing scheme.  As I started saying around 2011, “Burn. It. Down.”

“What you do is, you load all the friendlies onto ships and take them out to the South China Sea.  Then you bomb the country flat.  Then you sink the ships.”

            And that’s why the Tea Party was totally ineffectual, they are all pussies.  Nice pussies, but still pussies.  What you would have wanted them to do, is swarm the lefties and rout them.

        I think you’re right about Black Lives Matter putting Trump over the top. Some Afrocentric in a dashiki kills some cops, and Hillary Clinton’s response was to say “Police need sensitivity training.” A society cannot function with that level of stupid/evil at the helm. It would be like a woman calling the cops to her apartment, where she had a black eye and her boyfriend was screaming, and the cop shrugging and saying, “Well, maybe you should learn how to cook a steak.” It’s the same when people say “Abolish ICE.” How about we abolish stop signs and traffic lights? After all, people stopped in routine checks often end up going to jail, and their children might cry when they’re separated from them, and that’s all that matters. The left has quantity (demographics) but not a lot of quality (minorities and feminists).

            This is true—traditionally black rioting has been good for the right.  Derb and brimelow frequently opine about the “interglacial” period of the 90s, when many paleo right wing books got through the publishing glacier, eg the bell curve and brimelow alien nation.  They attribute it to the break up of the Soviet Union, which is probably a factor, but I think the LA riots were a big contributing factor.  The problems the msm so desperately tried to cover up came blasting through every television like a fire hose.  There were many propagandistic movies made, apologetics for the inner city blacks, such as Boys on the Hood and Menace 2society.  This was by way of damage control.

        Busy today, so short comment. The real false equivalence between the leftist Jacobin mob foaming at the mouth about Kavanaugh and the Tea Party demonstrations is that the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice is, by design in in the constitution, not subject to democratic processes. The founding fathers were perfectly aware of democratic mob politics and wisely removed lifetime appointments from their influence.
You want to have a say about a Supreme Court Justice, then get your ass elected as President or a Senator. Short of that, shut your pie hole.

        zman is right about the violence only getting worse. Nothing, but nothing, unleashes frothing rage like dashed expectations. The lefties have been ginned up to expect this “blue wave” next month and if it does not materialise (which it won’t) then expect some serious violence to follow. I see dead people.

        The Pacific grey whale was ever-present in the Sakhalin I and II projects, on which I worked. I even went to the whale observation post in the north of Sakhalin Island on one occasion, and was pals with the guy running the programme. Anyway, greenies used the dwindling numbers to try to shut down the projects, or at least get attention, and someone did ask why they don’t just bring a load or eastern grey whales to live with their cousins offshore Sakhalin. I don’t know if that would have worked, but it was no less BS than the claims bulldozer vibrations are stopping the whales breeding.

        Would just like to provide some perspective on the current state of the union.   Things were much worse in the late 60’s and early 70’s than they are now.  Lots of successful assassinations of elected and civil officials; some near misses that still did damage to the victim.  Several attempts on the life of the president.  Huge street protests.  Of course the Chicago dem convention cluster fuck.  The economy sucked like Lena Durham at a biker bar.  And on and on and on.  Oh oh oh Mr Kotter, remind them of gasoline rationing!

            Pretty damn close!  Certain lines sounded just like our hosts’ voice. The narrator also has a very similar cadence to his words.
Zman, give it a listen and tell us if the narrator sound ike he’s from where you grew up 🙂   Ironically, you probably won’t think he sounds like you 🙂
