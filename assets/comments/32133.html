        I listen to John Mearsheimer and Jeffrey Sachs on Glenn Greenwald’s show. They are on the show quite often, and I am sure a big reason for that is that nobody in the mainstream media has any interest in talking to them. They have both been correct about this war from the beginning. Now, while I think they are both intelligent men, it’s not because they are prophets. It is because this outcome was incredibly easy to predict for anyone who is outside of the imperial court (something both of them have acknowledged). After the Snake Island/Ghost of Kiev stuff, I decided to believe whatever the opposite of the media was saying about it, but at this point it’s how we should operate for everything. Because the media is the mouthpiece of the imperial court, and the imperial court is operating in a fake world of lies. It is managed by people who do not believe in reality and believe that what they say makes truth. It is not operating in reality anymore.

            They both regularly talk to Andrew Napolitano and the Duran guys as well.

I hate to always be the spoil sport, but you do realize that this would be
(((Mearsheimer))) and (((Sachs))) and (((Greenwald)))?
Right?
Bueller?
Anyone?

                    Yes, obviously (except not Mearsheimer). Ron Unz is too, but I am pretty sure most of us on this side read his website and find it invaluable. So I don’t see someone being Jewish as instantly disqualifying or whatever this is supposed to mean.

This is why we lose.
You simply cannot extend the olive branch of indubiousness to the Ne Plus Ultra mesmerizers.
That’s how they pull the wool over your eyes, Bro.
They don’t play by the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.
Sigh.

            That really is the thing, isn’t it? I wrote from the start that there was no scenario for a Ukraine victory other than NATO nuking Russia. I was not working from secret knowledge, but stating the obvious. The reason the “nationalist” all hate me now is I said it was suicide for Ukraine to go to war on behalf of Washington. How they could not see that still perplexes me, but self-delusion is a popular drug for a reason.

                Then they aren’t really nationalists, are they? Lap dog vassals like the Estonian bitch are not nationalists. Even the fatass vindman and the other dual passport freaks aren’t nationalists. Those who would sacrifice their nation at the feet of the freaks on the potomac and the hudson don’t deserve to be called nationalists.

                    Just so. How can turning over your nation’s sovereignty to a foreign power be considered nationalism? In point of fact, it’s a form of treason.

                        I lived in Tallinn for a time, before they became part of the EU. Native Estonians, especially the older ones, do not like Russians, to put it mildly, and I sympathize. Their entire history has been domination by one country or another, but the Soviet domination was by far the worst. They look at that, and then look at the sodomy flag, and choose the sodomy flag. I think their reasoning is we can ignore the sodomites all we want, and stay away from Muslim imports all we want, but the Russian military and secret police is really fucking scary.I can see why they joined NATO, but I really hate they joined the EU. They gave their sovereignty away because…Finland did? Estonia’s motto: Just do what the Finns or maybe the Swedes do.

                            This is true, unfortunately. The people of the former Warsaw Pact resent the hell out of Russia. However, I’m not sure why they don’t simply toe a neutral line between Russia and the BFE. Hell, why not reformulate the Warsaw Pact sans Russia?

                                Reviving the interwar Intermarium idea after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but before the United States became GloboHomo’s wrecking ball, able to achieve nonalignment and counterbalance East and West might have been possible but the time has passed now. It would have taken very adroit diplomacy which was in short supply.

Of the former Warsaw Pact and Near Abroad countries, Bulgaria, Byelorus and Serbia are the only ones I can confidently say are pro-Russian. All of the countries in the WP/NA have far more in common with Russia than the BFE, but the scars of Soviet domination, unfortunately, seem to override that fact.

                                        Serbia, absolutely. Both the government and the people. Bulgaria, Macedonia and Montenegro I think have pro Western puppet governments, but the man on the street is very sympathetic to Russia. I think even Greeks are sympathetic to Russia, but I’m guessing their government is also run by the west.

                            Why in any sane world would the Baltic midgets join NATO? Russia was no threat to them at the time and joining an alliance when you’re on the front lines of that alliance against their only foe is suicidally stupid. Stay neutral and out of the affairs of other nations. They are no more than a speedbump for Russia and a free-fire zone for their so-called allies. If there is a war, I guarantee there will more casualties from NATO action than Russian. Some nations shouldn’t exist, they’re too stupid and suicidal.

                        Back in the early 90’s when the US decided to build a new Embassy in the former communist country from which my parents came, I was elated. I thought it would be good for that country to become a part of the western share in all the luxuries and the standard of living we all enjoy. I thought it would be good for them.Now I look at the US presence as a cancer in the Balkans. I would love for them to pull a Niger and throw them out. The world has fallen apart since then and we deserve much of the blame.

It’s embarrassing and gross – all the garbage this country has exported around the world – to say nothing of death and destruction.  I hardly want to even identify as American…

                Occasionally, I watch Bill Krystol’s youtube channel to get an idea of what’s going on in neocon mind. I guarantee you that they view Project Ukraine as a success and will be more than happy to start another project someplace else when this is done.

                I wondered that myself, it seemed to be obvious that in order for the United States and NATO to win a war on Russia’s own border would require military strikes inside Russia.Well now thats where we are at.On the brink of a world war we cant win unless we use nuclear weapons.And even then, no one wins.And its horrifying to think our moron rulers just might go there.Some of the nationalists we all know got this completely wrong.

                I think most of us believed a Russia collapse when the hyper-sanctions were visited on them.
That is what Empire relied on as they long-proven, never-failing, device of victory.They somehow and for a short time menaced China to second that or else; had China made the wrong choice there, Russia would have collapsed, without the need for a military defeat.

                    The Chinese were too smart for that; they realized that they would ne next. So, they elected to be in it to win it.
Are they or Russia my ideal? No, but they are different peoples trying to be true to themselves and their cultures. This is admirable in my book. As a nation state we no longer hew to that guiding principle because of our enforced demographic replacement, so we face the need to reassemble as a People – separating from our purported nation – as our only way to recover this estate.

            I use the Edge homepage on my computer because I’m too lazy to change it. They still have stories on it about 1000s of Russians killed daily, 70 or so tanks, 45 artillery pieces, multiple jets shot down, ships sunk and all that without any verification. 404 says it so it must be true. Today there was one about a strategic bomber downed which is absolute bs because they don’t have to be close to the line to do what they do.This is the first war ever in which success is measured by PR victories for one side. The problem with that though is what happens when it all falls apart. Will the true believers react by destroying the world or will they hopefully off themselves and make the world a better place?

                There is obviously a concerted effort to push this propaganda across the internet, including on X and dark corners of the internet. That’s what you get when you have people in charge who believe in magical thinking, that their words bring reality into existence. The obvious question – if Ukraine is winning, why are they losing? – is uncouth. You look at this ridiculous “peace summit” that Zelenskyyyyyyy is hyping, you look at the “peace plan” he is putting out there (return of all territory including Crimea, reparations for war costs, and handover of Russian leaders for war crimes prosecution), you look at how Western leaders are taking this seriously, and you realize that these are not rational or even sane people. We are being driven off a cliff by lunatics and haven’t figured out how to take control of the wheel.

                    We can’t take control of the wheel Brother because the steering wheel got tore off a long time ago but what we can do is jump off of the insane clown bus…Thing is most peoples seats are too comfy, the AC still works, the galley is still serving food, etc etc…The ground also looks like it has some rocks and cactus on it so it might hurt to jump now and we are going pretty fast so let’s wait until it slows down a bit and come on who’s to say if there even is a cliff…So sit back and we will try to get with the other passengers and elect a new bus driver and try to ignore the flat tire, the brakes that are gone, and that high piercing sound of an engine that’s about to blow…

            2 years ago, a guy I work with who speaks fluent Russian and was an attaché there for years gave me a rundown on how Russia would lose.  I was polite, and just shook my head and said, “I doubt it.  Let’s see what happens.”Flash forward a year+ and we’re on the topic again.  He asked me how I had known it would drag out like this with Ukraine taking heavy losses.  I told him, “Because I wake up every morning and ask myself one question: how are they lying to me today?”His eyebrows raised, because he simply couldn’t comprehend that his government and everything he believed was a carefully constructed lie.Then I switched to the latest COVID vaccine because he said he was going to Walgreens to get the latest one..  “”Five shots in 7 months is not a ‘vaccine’, it’s a profit center.  How are they lying to me today.”The next day, he told me he had gone to Walgreens and encountered a huge line.  He thought about what I had said…and went home without getting the shot.it is VERY HARD to shake the true believers out of their trance, but it can be done.✌️

            Unfortunately, clown world’s myths will most likely outlive clown world. The ruins will be blamed on not enough dieversity, not enough girl power etc, and that can go on for a good while.

                Good gods, you’re right. Nature doesn’t give a flying fudge about how Whites feel about being the “fair flowers meant to be spread.” In the longest scheme of things, we’re just a stage in development too.
Well, at least I got to be there. Can’t ever take that away from me, or from the eternal memory of immortals like near everyone else here. You guys will seed Whiteness into all the new worlds to be born. Cool, that.

            I think it may be a winning issue if it’s joined with the end of universal suffrage in general.  Most of the schemes I’ve seen pitched would exclude me as well (not a veteran, kids are grown, etc.) which I don’t have an issue with as it would be nice forsomeoneto have a say in the government rather than the current situation of no one.

                Knowing what an idiot I was at 35, and everyone else I know was at 35, it would be an incredibly stupid idea to disenfranchise the “olds”. There’s a reason boards of directors used to be old white men — they had seen or even made many of the mistakes that destroy companies, and learned from it.
Not that I expect anything intelligent to emerge from what is essentially random lashing out in anger at everything, but it does remind me that there are worse things than clown world. Boards being filled with 12 YO trannies?

This is why we shouldn’t extend the franchise to arificial legal fictions, either- PACs, activists, lobbies, modern corporations, foundations.

                                The lesson is never learned in government because no one has to personally bear the cost of bad choices.
Same point @Zman makes about managers. Though managers tend to be much more accountable than government workers.

        Becoming the world leader seems to foster these delusional cults amongst the elites..In 1914, a handful of British elites, including Churchill, dragged England and its small and poorly equipped army into an all out war with Germany’s powerful army and superb Krupp artillery…And they promised that the boys would be home by Christmas, because England never loses..4 years later, 1.1 million men dead, and bankrupt, they got the worthless Versailles treaty…This pattern has doubtless repeated many times in history…

            Imagine where Great Britain would be now if they just stayed out of WWI, or at least realized their mistake and stayed out of WWII. They handed over imperial superiority to the united States to get into a useless brother war.
One of the most interesting part of WWII was FDR’s realization that he could suck Great Britain dry and establish U.S. as a global power in its stead. Love or hate the guy, he played an incredible political game.

                Great Britain and France both were stripped of all colonies at the end of WWII. DeGaul knew exactly what was going down. (Macron is today’s opposite type of Frenchman, the globalist lapdog variety.) Anyway, all the blather about self-determination and “democracy” was just obfuscation gas.  The current NATO attack poodles would do well to remember that Poland was handed off to Stalin, like a door prize.

                    The timelines are a bit short here.  The writing was on the wall, but the colonies peeled off throughout the late 40’s through the early 60’s.  And in many cases, only after the colonies rose up in rebellion.

                I posit that unmentioned factor is why the Occident has ‘cycles’ of history, and the Orient does not.
The Orient has rises and falls of regime and culture, but each looks exactly the same as the one before. The Orient seems to have peaked at 200 BC-200 AD, and remained unchanged until affected by the West.___________(Ultimately, the East didn’t have big giant meteors smashing into it as did North America and the Middle East. Those periodic events, some 14,000 and 4500 years ago, molded the genetic ecology into the children of change.)

                    Perhaps, but this could also mean that the Orient has been revived and revitalized while the West has exhausted itself (assuming you are talking about east Asia). It remains to be seen how China does in the following decades. If they can somehow fix their demographic trends, they will rise far above everybody else.

        Historian Kenneth Clark in his BBC series “Civilization” (excellent BTW) when summing up why civilizations fail tells a story about how Roman towns on the periphery would get all excited/scared/engaged when rumors that the barbarians were coming and they were about to be sacked.Then they were passed by and the reaction was disappointment.KC basically said that this is what happens when civilizations are exhausted; no energy, no ideas, no appetite for risk or innovation.  Just passively wishing “something” would happen.That’s what this nuclear brinksmanship seems like.  Children who are bored and keep grabbing new toys, not really caring what happens because nothing ever does.

        Although I’m still firmly of the belief that the regime will never let Trump enter the White House, I’m coming to the realization that despite all the demographic-border issues, the single most important reason for a Trump victory is that it would throw sand in the gears of this inexorable march toward war with Russia.

                I suspect a central element of his campaign is going to be, “When I left office, we weren’t at war with Russia and inflation was 1%.”
And when Biden calls him a “convicted felon” I hope his response is, “Thank you for setting the precedent that prosecuting former presidents is now okay.  That’s going to come in super handy when I beat you.”

                Unimpressive or not, the problem for Trump—the would be peacemaker—is going to be massive.  Basically, he’s gonna have to eat crow and concede Ukraine.  At which point he’ll give extended life to the neocons and of course the  Dem’s will have field day.Not sure he’s strong enough to do so.  But I’m a hopeless optimist.  Perhaps Putin will toss him a bone and consider giving him a Pyrrhic victory (i.e., peace with honor) in hopes of a working relationship his next four years.  Strong men like Putin have a respect for other strong men and then they can have back room deals with some confidence.On the other hand, the first time he calls Putin a deranged murderer, all bets are off.  You’ll know within a week after the inauguration which way this falls.

                    There’s no issue with “conceding Ukraine”.  The public won’t care.  We’ll get the same lectures about “abandoning our friends” (lol) in Iraq and Syria.  Neither of those really hurt Trump and his attempts to get us out of the different civil wars enjoyed public support.

                            Great reason to keep having elections, n’est-ce pas? Voting makes certain that our point of view is never represented or even expressed, but kept locked away safely on dissident websites.
Rather than elections, selections. Select someone to represent yourself. To be your agent. To fire when  he does not act in your interests.

        Sometimes I seriously believe this is about hatred of Ukrainians. Nothing is ever done that remotely helps them or a better way of life. Now this atrocious cannon fodder war which we all know will not end well except for Russians.
of course I do know that rebuilding this country will be very lucrative except that will be Russia’s job. That and the inevitable reveal of western biolabs and foreign aid corruption and kickbacks. God, please give me this?

                I don’t know. Galicia wasn’t as hard-hit by the Holodomor as were the Kiev and Kharkhov regions, but still, that’s a whole crapton of the “usual suspects” that were starved. The areas that got off relatively easy were the more Russian (i.e., less “usual suspects”) regions in the north and east.
We’ve always been taught those regions were resettled and pacified by people forcefully exported from the RSFSR, but the part of the story that always bothered me is why they evidently selected such a huge percentage of “usual suspects” to send to pacify Ukraine.

                        Solzhenitsyn is tough, and not least because most of the English translations interpret it quite differently. I do not have the chops nor interest to read it in Cyrillic, and do not trust the translations because every one I’ve found differs sometimes significantly from other translations, have heavy Jewish ties, and, surprise, surprise, are called antiSemitic. It’s hardly a good primary source. The only reason I put much stock into his account is that supposedly, one of the major sources of resettlement population was the Kuban, where he was born. And, oddly, which also appears to have been struck hard by the contrived famine, but had enough population left to resettle Ukraine? Something seems fishy.But neither do I trust Stalin-era records, particularly when mass graves show that vastly more people died than their records say. And, obviously, with the western journalists so pro-Commie (Duranty, looking at you), western accounts are less than useless. And the Jewish accounts are not plausible, unless Jews were much more numerous than we think.Sorry to blather on, but I strongly suspect the true numbers are going to be somewhere between all of these, but where is anyone’s guess.

        These people have no reverse gear.  When the Ukrainians collapse, they’ll send in NATO troops.  When they are slaughtered and a carrier is sunk, they reach for nukes because backing off is never considered an option.

            2) Sheinbaum is so obviously a puppet that they are pretending she’s AMLO’s puppet, instead of a tool of “international finance”. She is, however, just as powerless against the cartels as her predecessor, which could pave the way for eventual annexation.
That’s one way to deal with the immigration issue, at least. 😣

                Sheinbaum, newly elected President of Mexico, and the other major presidential candidate, met with Larry Fink, head of Blackrock, preceding the election. I am sure it was merely a meet and greet, and nothing substantive was put on the table, no?Now, couple this with the news that Blackrock is helping to fund a Texas Stock Exchange, something just announced, designed to attract capital and corporations to Texas. Hmm. As the US disaggregates, what better way to position oneself for a future working relationship with a seceding Texas working closely with a Mexico being led by another tribal member? Food for thought.

            Yes. No choice. They are mostly out of goyim. And Banderites, BTW. Does that explain why there is interest in getting US troops pre-placed? Or is the long range plan to depopulate Ukraine of Jews, too, while giving the appearance of support? I’m leaning towards the latter. Ukraine for Blackrock.Too soon to tell. I doubt the new el Presidente has anywhere near the power we assume because of how much power our el Presidente wields. Mexico actually has a non-cuck opposition.

                1. “to depopulate Ukraine of Jews”- as I said to Mr. Gottfried, globalist J clearing out patriotic Js makes sense (as did their ancestors in internationalist German KPD). We forget that little J is usually quite patriotic; that’s why the over-the-top propaganda is so strident, because it’s primarily internal messaging to sway the audience one wants most to reach.  (Good catch, by the way.)
2. I expect Steinbaum to be more of a Hillary, Mad Albright, Toria Nuland, Sulla Ledeyn or Susan Powers than a Swedish Cabinet. Eager to shine, rather than loving the Studio 54 spotlight.

                            The same dynamic goes for us.  Our worst enemy is our own.It goes for any demographic.
The Middlemen’s superpower is selling people the false promises of their own desires.  Promises to the poor, promises to the rich, promises to the good, promises to the narcissistic sociopaths that carve their way to the top.
That’s how an ambitious minority can latch on for the ride, by appearing “useful”, selling amulets, spells, and some quiet direct loans or dirty deeds to ‘solve your problem’.

                        It make eminent good sense, and one can observe its playing out at various historical junctures. Helps to keep the little Jews on side for fear of being abandoned to deal with the blowback from the Big Jews’ provocative, bad acts; hang together, or get left behind to face the music.

                From what I’ve seen, they are mostly snatching up Carpathians, Moldovans, Romanians and the occasional Bulgarian. The last three, agreed, Odessa area, but Carpathians are south-west Ukraine.
But many of the videos now being distributed are months old. Those people are almost certainly dead by now.

        Luckily, it’s all about narrative to our rulers. They’ll spin some yarn about how Russin won by throwing 6 million soldiers at Ukraine and overwhelming them. We’ll get a peace deal and the media will never speak of this again nor will any of the people responsible be punished.
But the world will have changed. The RoW will know that the US military is a shell of its former self. In addition, alternative financial/trade routes will grow.

            Given their obsession with faux narratives in regards to Ukraine this is definitely a possibility &amp; one I had not considered. All the latest escalations US has done could very well be intimidation tactics with no real intent to actually go all the way. Everything the US has done from the beginning fits this non committal posture of them tip toeing up to but stopping before full blown war to get the desired result.If this is how it’ll end I suspect they won’t admit defeat but invent a new narrative where they really beat the hell out of Russia &amp; the peace deal is an admission of defeat ontheirpart. Then of course they’ll never mention it again as you said.I hope you’re right &amp; I think you probably are, as crazy as these people are nuclear war puts their own skin in the game even if they avoid being vaporized themselves. I doubt any of these people want to live in a bunker while there’s a nuclear fallout going on in the ruined country they previously ruled over.

                If they were smart, they would allow Trump to win.  They could blame him for pulling the plug, and in general release a lot of growing anti-regime steam in the US.  Alas, they really believe they can’t survive 4 years of a moderate Republican, so they have to destroy the country to save it.

            Just because one is a citizen of a silly country doesn’t mean that one has to remain one, or even if one does, that one has to remain in said country. Although leaving it may be problematic…I’ll never qualify wealth- or politics-wise, but those who are candidates might consider the second passport. We’re already in a world where the State Department apparently can arbitrarily suspend a citizen’s privilege (it’s not a right?) to travel, lest he might say unflattering words at a Russian event. It’s worth developing that point a bit further: It’s a no-brainer that a citizen can be prohibited from leaving if he’s wanted or suspected of a crime (e.g. Snowden.) And aliens are (were) routinely denied entry for any number of reasons. But I’ve never in my life heard of a citizen being denied exit for such arbitrary reasons.It’s unlikely there are any readers here currently in Ukraine. But according to reports, a dual citizenship won’t let you out of there, now. I guess they really need bodies at the front.

        The UKR counteroffensive was probably the most outrageous thing I’ve seen from NATO planners. They literally made their base assumption that the Russians would run away like the Iraqi army in 1991.
I’m sure their internal projections for a war with China also assume similar levels of incompetence. Probably assuming that the Chinese ships are made out of wood.

        Since day one it has been evident that the primary and ultimate reason for this war (from the POV of those running the real strategy) is the destruction of *the West* (not Russia) – which is, after all, exactly the global establishment strategy within all the Western nations.The destruction of Russia is just a rationalization to get the middle management on-board. Russia’s real job is to be the thorn upon which NATO (and the West, generally) impales itself.This is working well for those who engineered it – which is why there is no change in strategy. The sanctions were designed to harm the West, they did – and they have been increased many times. The pipeline was destroyed by the West to harm Germany, and it did. The West has massively depleted its arms (and some personnel), without replacing them.Assisted by the (ever increasing) sanctions; Russia has become stronger – economically, militarily, in allies, and in resolve – and could now probably defeat the entirety of (what’s left of) NATO, even without the Chinese help that would (surely?) be forthcoming.(The global establishment *hate* Russia as the only Christian nation, and don’t want it strong in the long term – but They hate the West more, and are happy for now to “use” Russia as a means to their primary goal.)The Ukrainian war will continue and escalate (so long as the present gang stay in charge, and people are blind or indifferent to what is happening) because the West is now (and willingly) killing-itself abroad – just as the West (led by its elite, and not-significantly-opposed by its masses) has been enthusiastically destroying itself at home for at least the past 50 years.I believe that widespread nuclear war is positively desired, and being actively worked-for – within the necessity to deceive the middle managers.The people behind this war have no national (or indeed human) affiliation, and they believe they personally will survive whatever may happen.And as long as some bits of the earth remain “use-able” (which they believe would be the case) then the more people that are killed with the greatest suffering possible (this is a Spiritual War, after all!), the more they will like it!

        Ukraine will not resolve these issues quickly, and the average overall quality of Ukrainian forces on the frontline will likely decrease as experienced personnel rotate out and newly-deployed personnel reach the frontline even as the number of available soldiers increases.New soldiers will likely learn rapidly as they fight alongside experienced veterans, however.

            I’m not.  As I mentioned once before, we learned a lesson of such in the Vietnam conflict.  US soldiers—even after full training—placed in combat suffered relatively *high* casualty rates for their first 3 months or so, then dropped down to their fellow infantrymen’s rates.
Why?  Simple, the training could not match the field of conflict encountered.  Stupid soldiers certainly did stupid things and quickly eliminated themselves, but that does not explain all.  Much to be learned—and quickly—from your experienced fellow soldiers.
I don’t see that not being the case in Ukraine.

                    Sure.  Training plus experience = minimal casualties.  No training = more than the minimal casualties.  However it does not equal complete elimination, nor complete ineffectiveness of the fighting force thrown into the conflict.  You do what you have to do when pressed.

        Whatever insanity befalls us in the coming weeks, the average Joe at the bottom of the social pyramid can do nothing to impact these macro-events. Anxious worrying just induces useless despair, so focus on yourself and family. The spring is winding tighter faster now, so the explosion of anger is just waiting on a trigger. Most people will strike out locally at the most convenient object, but there is a better way. Those responsible for these calamities are still among us. Justice demands that they be the sole bearer of necessary consequences, or the disease will persist. The pathogens must go or we will die having earned our fate via abdication of our ancestral imperative. It will soon be time for the Viking spirit in you to reemerge. Do not shirk this duty.

                There are still protests going on – I was reading about one in San Francisco yesterday. The local governments, though, got their orders and are sending in their goon squads to beat them up and cart them off to jail far quicker. Also, too, it seems that the media got their orders and were told not to report on them as much (because, as always, the media’s primary power is the power to ignore).

            To riff off Tucker Carlson, liars are rewarded and truthtellers are punished. Samuel Huntingdon, one of the original New Dealers and a man of the Left, told the truth about immigration, identity and the fragility of the world and was hounded the remainder of his days. His CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS AND WHO ARE WE? have been proven right in every aspect. Huntingdon’s delusional contemporary Francis Fukuyama is lauded as a prophet–and not one that failed. These people control nukes and will use them because they are even more detached from reality than schizophrenics. If someone does Twitter they should follow Michael McFaul, Obama’s ambassador to Moscow, to see the degree of insanity involved.

        This is an important article by Z. Arguing that The End of History and the Last Man is the manifesto and primary text of post-Cold War America is persuasive and has strong explanatory power. And oddly enough, Michel Foucault and his ilk, the very people whose work provided the blueprint for the internal destruction of the West, also explain why Fukuyama and the neocons are dead wrong: the various people of the world are fundamentally, irreduciably different, which means they don’t all desire the same things such as liberal democracy, “enrichment” by alien peoples, and mustachioed men in puce sundresses serving as generals. Consequently, the attempt to turn the entire planet into a single gigantic, suppurating, convulsing, gibbering AINO, by missile or by bomb, is doomed to fail.Ironically, it is Russia, a nation that at best pays lip service to dieversity, that stands as the flag-bearer for geopolitical pluralism, while the GAE, for whom dieversity is a god, seeks to turn the world into a monolith.

                    His books are in professorial language that’s useless to normal people, but in his interviews and editorials he makes his points straightforwardly.The Essential Works Vol 3collects his best “political” material. If his name weren’t on it you’d think it was the work of an extremely cynical paleo-libertarian. Well worth a few bucks.

        Folks there is no problem.  The below article on Zero Hedge shows how the US/NATO will arrange to send troops from everywhere to stop those dreadful Russians should the need arise.   Look at all of the corridors they will use.   Russia will be overwhelmed and NATO/US will probably drive Ivan all the way to the Pacific Ocean.  It worked in Iraq right?Of course the article doesn’t explain that the Russians, unlike Iraq,  have submarines, very good air defense and long range missiles that might make moving all of those troops problematic.   But hey, let’s not spoil the elites fantasies.   This time it is going to work.  I mean our Western elites are really smart people.https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/report-details-us-troop-land-corridors-event-ww3-russia-heart-europe

            Now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has secured his historic fifth term in office, it is patently clear that he will devote his next six-year spell at the Kremlin topursuing his paranoid obsession of confronting the West
I know people who believe this propaganda. “Putler is a paranoid dictator who hates the West for no reason”. It’s so tiring to have to live among monkeys.

The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised his head again. The bulletin! But no, they were merely changing the music. He had the map of Africa behind his eyelids. The movement of the armies was a diagram: a black arrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow tearing horizontally eastward, across the tail of the first.…[Eventually the bulletin appears:]He could hear just enough of what was issuing from the telescreen to realise that it had all happened as he had foreseen…

                I don’t see how this could happen?  We’ve had repeated experience with our NATO allies in the sand wars.  Never did they involve themselves in the heavy lifting—except Great Britain.  In at least one case the few soldiers the put in got creamed and they withdrew (think it was Germany). I’d say, aside from the Poles, they’ll crumble or perhaps rather, the American military will again do the heavy lifting, except in their countries.

                    But this won’t be a sand war against some puny sheikdom. It will be a brutal grind against a real world power. And as such, NATO troops will have to venture into harm’s way if NATO is to have even the slightest chance of victory. And if that happens, legions of stiffs will be returning to DC, Berlin, London and Paris.

                        Sure, but will the forces effectively resist, when they did not in the sand wars?  With the minimal risk they undertook there, there was much resistance from home country.  That’s my point, not that they will meet weaker or stronger opposition against a 1st world foe.  The point is, will they fight effectively, or fold?  Hell, even France folded in WWII and they were only 20 years out from beating the same foe in WWI.

        I predicted that the Russian strategy is a return to a modernizedKabinetskreig, a couple years back, rather than Western bifurcated “strategy” that swings wildly from Fourth Generation Forever Wars of choice fought by volunteers who take no casualties to reviving Total War concepts that owe more to 1944 than 2024. The Western political and military elites cannot conceive of the kind of war the Russians are fighting on a geopolitical level, much less a strategic or operational level, and thus have no conception of how to respond to it. AINO has never fought aKabinetskreig, and won’t learn now, because the Fistagon and the State Department and the Institute for the Study of War is always right.

        Color me surprised. Not!Germany’s military is not, and has never been, in any sort of readiness state in over two decades if not more.Once the wall came down, the West spent everypfennigon reunification. NATO is a joke and only the elites running everything, living in their fantasy world, believe it’s something else.Never forget, Donald Trump put Angela Merkel in her place when he demanded she pay up for their NATO contribution. They were laughing then, they’re not laughing now.Even the most mentally disturbed recognize the damage Ursula von der Leyen did to the German military as former Minister of Defense.Her brilliant policies are why our pilots will be flying her broomstick into UkraineOf course our tanks don’t work, but we very nice brand new public libraries in Leipzig which no ones uses.Our fighter jets may be grounded but the new indoor heated swimming pool in Arnstadt is lovely, especially in February.Of course we don’t have machineguns, but Dresden has really nice new sidewalks now.

        Recent pieces I read on CNN and WaPo indicate that perhaps elite consensus is coming apart. The CNN clip was about how useless the Abrams tanks are in Ukraine; the WaPo article bemoaned Russia’s superior electronic warfare capabilities, causing (Excalibur?) guided shells costing $100,000 a pop (your tax dollars at work!) to miss their targets. If the Ukrainian front line buckles by October it’s going to be very bleak for Biden.

        The geographic unassailability of AINO turns out to be a curse as much as a blessing. It permits the GAE regime to remain in power through every conceivable overreach abroad, save nuclear war, and possibly through that too. It is free to make virtually any mistake. If the worst thing it has to fear is inflation, then I gotta say, that’s a pretty secure regime. In this sense, I see the collapse of the GAE’s illusions re: Ukraine/Russia as irrelevant to its domestic staying power.

            AINO doesn’t have geographic unassailability any more. I recollect that it was the Russian Foreign Ministry rather than their military that published a graphic showing the range envelope of one model of their air-launched hypersonic missiles that reached everywhere in CONUS except the very southern tip of Florida. Miami would be safe, unless the launching planes used air2air refueling for a little range boost.They did this in an attempt to communicate to the dumb-dumb people in the CityOfLondon-NYC-WDC Axis of Evil that the correlation of forces has changed, and that they need to wake up and start taking that into account.

                    You can’t “contain” China without a blue water navy — something only one country in the world still has. If China decides to invade Taiwan, the island cannot hold out for long without direct military intervention from the U.S. We couldn’t even “send aid” like we are doing in Ukraine. The first thing China would do would be a total blockade of the island — a blockade that could only be lifted by force.

        We’re going to see U.S. troops officially in the trenches by Winter, and cries for blood when they start getting blown to bits with drones. Russia will not escalate and follow their successful grinding strategy. I have doubts the U.S. will go for full air superiority though, as the casualties would be catastrophic.

            If there’s to be a major western boots on the ground presence in Ukraine, it would have to come mostly from Poland, with a leavening of other NATO participants. The capability (and manpower) for it to be otherwise just isn’t there. Since they just got their desired regime change in Poland, it could happen.

            There is an interesting race against the clock happening. Biden’s handler do not want an escalation before the election as they have reasoned it would be bad for them. There is a limit to the amount of vote rigging they can do. That and a major escalation would be something Trump could promise to reverse if elected.Instead, they have a two track plan. One track is Biden wins and they can fully escalate in Ukraine along the lines of the original narrative that says they can win a war of attrition. The other track is Biden loses and they immediately escalate in Ukraine, leaving Trump with a fait accompli.The trouble is Ukraine may not hold out until November. The front is now moving west about a kilometer per day and that will only accelerate as the Russians push through in various spots that have major strongholds. There is always the possibility that Zelensky wakes up with a landmine in his bed.

                I’m not as confident about a limit to vote rigging at the Presidential and Senate levels.  The only limit I see is in the House, where the big liberal cities can’t push fake ballots into all the small congressional districts.  If Trump wins, it is because they are smart enough to back off, let him win, blame him for everything, and come back in 4 years with a non-dementia candidate.  But they just can’t help themselves.

                Yes, the incipient WW III has top billing here, but in a related vein, there’s been some very intriguing shift in Narrative on other hot button issues:Immigration: So Biden is cracking down on the open border all of a sudden? “Election year” would be the go-to guess. But this second one is a bit murkier:Covid-19 “vaccine” issuers: there’s been a series of these in recent weeks. To me, a major eye-opener is the BMJ study linking the jab to excess deaths. For those unaware, the BMJ is one of the top medical journals in the world. And that study has been widely reported in the major media. Yes folks, you read that right: talk that would get you banned on any social media three years ago is now openly discussed in prestige journals and on the MSM.Go figure.

            Can someone please explain to me the exact process by which large numbers of American troops could even be deployed to such an active war zone?
Russia has complete control of the Black Sea, air superiority bordering on supremacy, and a demonstrated ability to destroy air fields and staging centers anywhere in western Ukraine. Seems to me there would be heavy lossesbeforeyou could even get “boots on the ground” and even the mid-wit diversity hires in the Pentagon would balk at that.

                The Russians don’t have air supremacy, they do have missle air defence supremacy which would mean neither side would have control of the air.
The troops would be landed far away from the front, and then transported in overland.

                        Correct.  Note that Putin has said that the use (implying staging as well) of foreign forces will cause them to be engaged—even if not on Russian soil.  In short, you start building an army group in say, Poland, and Poland will be considered a target of opportunity as they say.  I don’t even blame Russia—sound reasonable from a self defense prospect to me.

                        The question here is what calling back means.  Everyone separating has a certain time “in jeopardy”.  You have so many years in the reserves and different readiness levels—at least that the way it used to be when I knew such people.  Now if they begin to demand that vet’s not in the readiness reserve come back, that’s another story.  On the other hand, there are bunches of State Army Reserves that are considered for immediate call up.  They make up the tail portion of our “tooth to tail” forces.

                Presumably, AINO troops would enter Ukraine through Poland. If that were attempted, however, Poland would take a fearful pounding. One, alas, it richly deserves.

            Ukraine is loosing 1000+ troops a day, I suspect NATO casualties would be in the same neighborhood.
For comparison, the US lost 400 troops a day in WW2.
Those kind of losses would necessitate a draft.
Imagine the US government bringing home 1,000 body bags a day, a draft, and half the country still pissed off about the election, whichever way it goes.
There would be so much pressure to break the stalemate with nuclear weapons.

        Yep. Everyone should readWhen Prophecy Fails. In the book, the cultists just start dropping off, after the initial burst of enthusiasm when the prophecy fails. We can only hope that the end game of post Cold War prophecy is as benign.

        Ukraine had the same manic effect on what passes for an intelligentsia in the west as Covid did for nurses.The one I think about is Timothy Snyder.  Bloodlands is worth reading, despite some problems.  He took flak from parts of the tribe for the crime of comparing their suffering to the suffering of the goyim.  He can write well.  And he has been a popularizer of the notion that populations without acces to a state are most suceptible to genocide.But 2016 pushed him to the edge and 2022 broke him.  I don’t think there is any way back for people like him.  His coffin will be draped with a Ukranian flag.

        “The current debate about letting Ukraine use NATO weapons to attack inside Russia is mostly about normalizing the idea of NATO attacking inside Russia, something the Russians will never tolerate.”The question is, what can Russia do about it?  I would think Putin does not want a wider war against NATO.  This would be incredibly destructive and expensive and cost millions of lives on all sides and risks nuclear escalation.  Cyber attacks? Attacks on space based assets?Scott Ritter claims a lot of these weapons that can hit inside Russia require the West’s active participation to use.  He says the atacms system needs a “digital package” that can only be generated by the US. He said the same for other systems from France and Britain. So if these systems were to hit targets inside Russia, the Russians would know it was us and not the Ukrainians (who may have technically pressed the button).

        I have another comment, and possibly one more.This is a link to support what the Zman has been trying to get across about “religion” in the political sense. Most importantly, the ‘Judeo-Puritan’ vision of America.(Some feel that you can’t call it a religion if it has no God. That violates their understanding of their relationship with God, and to do so makes no sense to them.I respect their affront, and hope to help illustrate an alternative view.)No need to read it all, please just scroll down for the rose-pink colored blocks towards the end. Those are the relevant quotes.(Also, a small quibble, note how the Frenchie sells us out at the very last.)Alistair Cooke, link at WRSA:https://strategic-culture.su/news/2024/06/03/the-coming-novus-ordo-seclorum-change-we-must-there-is-no-choice/I propose a new definition: A religion is not a God. It is a nation’s vision of itself.Thus, it can be a shared archetype, a Face of a People, much as a leader or visionary is the face of a movement, as Trump is to MAGA. Christ the King as our banner, for instance.In today’s case, it is the ruling class’s vision of itself, imposed through the doctrine relayed by the state’s clerisy.So, are we who we say we are, or are we who our rulers say we ought to be?Do we obey our own gods and angels, or do we obey theirs?

            A State is nothing more, nothing less than the substitution of God for Satan as lawgiver. So, yes, it is religion, in the sense that one is just coming up with an alternative source of authority for his society’s rules.
And once understood that the State has explicitly rejected God as its source of authority, to be replaced by Satan or by man, whatever your personal worldview, it should not come as a surprise that States do what they do.

        If mankind is in the clutches of irrationality (lol), the US government (followed closely by Germany) stands front and center above all.  And I would say it’s more like insanity rather than irrationality – you know, doing/saying the same things over and over and expecting a different or desired result.  The forces of darkness run deep and wide in Washington DC.
