        The BBC is, essentially, a London-based organisation (as is Skynews, for that matter) so all they think about is London stuff. That means to them that cheap vacations to France = very good, muslim mayor = good, diversity leading to restaurant choice = good, saving Syrian people = good, and with it not mentioning that the refugees go back to Syria for vacations = good, Brexit =very, very bad, rest of UK = very bad and not worth bothering with.Trouble is we still haven’t Brexited. We are still paying money to the fat buggers in Brussels and still subject to their insane whims and crappy laws because parliament and all the hordes of civil servants who cling to it are all stuck in the London mindset. Remember London = Brussels, or perhaps more accurately, London &lt; Brussels.The only economics that matters to the top dogs in the UK is what kick back can they get from the EU. And the EU pays them very well for being loyal.

            @ UKer – I have come to understand you Brits are London-centric in the same way the French are Paris-centric. If anything happens outside of those two major cities, nothing really happened at all.

                Karl, my impression of Germany is that the German news is much more decentralized (i.e. not all about the doings in the capital) than in the US, UK or France. How does it seem to you?

                    @ Lorenzo – Yes, that’s an accurate observation. Germany is not Berlin-centric in the way France and the UK tend to be. If something happens in Germany, everyone knows and Berlin does not dominate the media or policy. Which is why for example the Bavarian government had such attention during the immigration issues. But don’t think for a minute the German media isn’t controlled. The idea of a “free-press” has been dead for decades.

                Karl: you are 100 per cent correct in this. The biggest smile we provincials have is the issue of snow. If it snows and settles in London (which is usually a couple of degrees warmer than the rest of the UK) the BBC always leads its ‘news’ bulletins with film of the incredible disruption to London commuters. It’s like, wow, look at us being brave and battling through the soon-to-slushy white stuff.Meanwhile parts of the UK, Scotland in particular, is in fits of laughter as most of the land has been under snow, real deep snow at that, for weeks but that never gets reported on Al-Beeb. It’s just, you know, that other place we don’t think about. While we don’t have ‘fly-over’ country, we just have small and insignificant country.

                    @ UKer – I remember a few years back seeing a satellite picture of England around Christmas time. The entire island was white. But all we heard about was the disruption of the air traffic in London despite the fact the rest of the country was also at a stand-still and people were actually freezing to death up north.

        Well sure, the elites are hideously rich spoiled brats. They have rigged the activity of the rest of the human race to essentially be their personal cash cows and foot servants to strip mine of their intrinsic wealth at their leisure and whim. They can not imagine us dirt people refusing to comply never mind defying their economic and social omnipotence.What I think really insults them is the deplorable’s are beginning to revolt against de-culturing. We are talking about people who create nothing but trouble, they rob everyone of everything and think they are unique, special somehow, like demi-gods. But all they are are a criminal gang when you get down to it, running other criminal gangs, all feeding off the productive part of humanity.It is got out of control, we are going to be lucky to survive this cabal of psychopaths without a really bad period of turmoil and tribulation. Everything has consequences, but in their case, what with the magnitude of meddling and social engineering, the untended consequences are going to be very bad when it all begins to catch up to this world.You can’t do the things these clowns are doing, mess with peoples lives, their cultures, traditions, and most basic aspects of their lives and avoid the consequences. But the raw magnitude of what these people have done is especially malicious and grievous, it will only magnify the natural correction to the tyranny of it all.

            I have not heard an economist who was anywhere in the neighborhood of Libertarian since Milton Friedman passed.  I did have a Macro Econ professor in grad school who probably fit the bill – I still remember his motto:  “The economic drag of government on the economy is the NPV of expenditures minus transfer payments.”
None of the big-government EU-loving economists would say something so crass.  They are leftists, not libertarians or classical liberals.

                I shouldn’t be so hard on them. The ideas are sound and can have application in the real world in prudent hands. The hard core followers, however, misapply them constantly and end up making the ideas look like the idiots pushing them. Just read a book about the influence of Puritan ideas in English law. Turns out Coke was a bit of a trust buster in his abhorrence of monopolies and even was opposed to corporations in general, but he got together with other judges and officials and hammered out specific rules regarding when the concepts could be used appropriately and not. No ideologue he. We need ideas to guide us generally and prudence to keep us from walking off cliffs.

        Ignoring history is the flux capacitor of liberalism – it’s what makes faith in socialism possible.  Funny how you can trace every “intellectual” movement since the late 19th century back to that basic dynamic — they’re all the rationalization du jour for socialism.  Libertarian economics? “We like weed and cheap gardeners, therefore socialism.”  Postmodernism?  “The facts say socialism doesn’t work; we say there is no such thing as a fact; therefore socialism!”  Psychoanalysis? “People are getting crazier; must be capitalism.  Therefore, socialism!”  Etc. etc.  Sssshhhhh….don’t tell them, but it’s exactly the same thing as those awful Evangelicals trying to pray away the gay.  And just as effective.

        It fails to astound me.  Kind of like knowing that fire can burn.  Certain ideas have been proven throughout history to fail.  The old saying about Socialists and their past failures … “Well, ‘we’ will make it work this time!  It just wasn’t done right in the past.”Same same.  Like gravity.  What goes up must come down.  It just is.  But some people (why so many?) seem incapable of accepting reality?  It really is as Michael Savage coined “a mental illness.”We need to bring back Insane Asylums and when these ideas pop up, put those spouting them away.  It is like shouting “fire!” in public.

                That’s the population of a smallish- to medium-sized town. Higher circulation than a great deal of local newspapers. Better caliber of reader, too. Only a ~10,000:1 reader:commenter ratio, though.

                    My sort of blog does not lend itself to attracting comments. The blogs that do a few short pithy comments on a news story *invite* comments. There’s also the fact that many people on twitter have pointed out that the comments here are better than most. I see a lot of links to specific comments. That’s going to intimidate the sort of guy who posts at Breitbart.

                            Personally, I like the less comments / short comments.  I learn a lot from discussions here, and the short comment thing makes me kinda sorta try to rein in my natural long-windedness (flame away, comrades… flame away).

                                    In the 21st century a great joke becomes part of the national fabric in about two days. A great idea takes only a few days more. Wonderful minds are building a thing one piece at a time, like a stone wall. Every stone that fits makes it better. The shape of the whole becomes more clear. The right wing are the true progressives, and the only ones.

                        I very much enjoy this blog and the lively banter between those that take the time to reply. I’m not sure how many non-US readers are in here, but for myself, it has certainly been very interesting to see an American perspective most of us here in Europe may not fully appreciate. I hope in some ways, while my own views are not so often shared (especially those critical of the US) we can come to understand and appreciate each others opinions despite our differences.

        Like Ptolemy’s crystal spheres, economics gets complex when it is used to support falsehoods and fraud.  BTW, because of the dirty agreement between the Republicans and Democrats to not have a budget since 2008 the Obama $900 billion stimulus has been in the spending bills for EVERY year since.

        The Bolsheviks were a bunch of economists and look where that all ended up.Speaking of Bolsheviks and economists, my favorite economist is using language straight from the Moscow show trials:Why Are The Media Objectively Pro-Trump?For those not familiar with the reference, during Stalin’s show trials, some cat like Pyatikov or Radek would get up and confess, “Sure I wassubjectivelyfulfilling the five year plan by ordering pig iron production doubled, butobjectivelyI was sabotaging the plan since the coal was actually needed for power production instead of coke.Thus the danger of letting economists anywhere near power. They’ve gotten so good at lying about their failed prognostications, that they can lie effectively about almost anything.Off ramp on the information superhighway:http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/krugman/2016/09/13/why-are-the-media-objectively-pro-trump/?smid=tw-nytimeskrugman&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;referer=

            I keep waiting for Hillary to start drunkenly ranting about “wreckers,” “capitalist-roaders,” and “right deviationists.”  Her wardrobe is already Mao-esque.

                There are some poorly sourced reports going around having her wandering the halls late at night moaning that “the fascists will hang me if I don’t get elected,” so we may not be far off, Severian.The language of High Stalinism is fascinating in a weird way. In the 20’s when Josef is buddying up to Kamenev and Zinoviev its still the very trite Comintern lingo (Sovnarkom is still my favorite). After WW2 when Dzhugashvili is tired and gray, the commissariats become ministries and wreckers and  deviationists become cosmopolitans and toadies before the West.  But in the ’30s, that was some agitprop!  Those boys weren’t fooling around.

            The EU central planners wish to create a USSR minus the mass exterminations and militarism  Like all elitists they believe the USSR, Venezuela, Cuba, all of USSR dominated Eastern Europe, etc., failed economically because they were not personally there to apply their intellectual acumen and genius to guide the ship.All that was missing was themselves.Such is the arrogance and hubris of the elites.Of course the prime motivating factor that drives the elites is their contempt for the decisions that average folks make and in a capitalist system (like used to exist in the USA until about 1925), elites are not needed; life goes on without them. For the elites, capitalism – and profits and wealth (for others only, but not for themselves) – are anathemaIf the EU bureaucrats are permitted to continue their trek towards establishing a socialist utopia, individual liberties will have to be curtailed (we already see this there; see speech codes) and Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm, will become a reality.The European people had better wake up (not picking on them; after all the US voter elected, twice, the con man Obama and the criminal Hillary is perilously close to becoming president).

        Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victim may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated, but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.

        The Conservative Treehouse makes an interesting point that nobody else has caught on to. We did not have just one stimulus. Once the stimulus occurred, it was incorporated into the baseline budget and we have spent the same amount in each following year. In effect, we have had eight stimuluses. Think about that. We would have a 13 trillion dollar debt right now if they hadn’t done that to us.

                    Most of it is terrible, but the scene at metal shows is the best. It often has an end of day vibe to it. AC/DC shows in the US used to be like that. The tailgate was better than the concert.

        I for one was very happy to see Brexit come to pass and I cheered on my British cousins and celebrated with their victory.But before you all decry the “horrors and abuse” of the EU – of which there is plenty –  you have to fully understand some of the benefits and why it remains important to Europe. For example, while the British argument claimed they paid 2-Euros and received 1-Euro back in benefits, but they failed to mention that Irish kids can now afford a college education thanks to EU tax contributions. That Italian historical sites like Pompeii have been saved in part from combined taxes which the Italians by themselves couldn’t afford. French roads and highways have been improved to ensure faster transport of goods. These stories are in part only possible due to the EU and have happened all across EU member states.Just like in the US, states like South Dakota benefit from Federal funding thanks to taxes collected from California, New York and other states. In that same way, much good has come from the combined efforts of the EU. Clearly, not all was wisely spent (like EC Commission Regulation No 2257/94, which states that all bananas must be “free of abnormal curvature” and at least 14 cm in length). But the EU actually came down on the state of Hessen when Frankfurt tried to lower the standards for public water purity. So it’s a mixed blessing.Personally, I want harmonized laws and regulations so we can sell and trade using industrial standards in Europe like DIN and BS in the same way you have ASME and ANSI in the US. And the EU is the right place for this to happen.

            You are right, Karl, that so much of Europe has benefitted from spreading the money around. The issue is whether those countries who benefit should sort out their own taxation and thus not have to rely on taking it from others.While I am glad French roads are heaven for drivers, I would have thought the benefits to the French people of making their own roads better for traffic would be more of their own priority. Having the EU gather many taxes (and fines and licence fees and what have you) is an expensive undertaking, and then the expense is added to by having people arguing who should get a slice of this very substantial cake. The French government, if in charge of their own taxes, should determine what the priorities are for France. That’s the root of Brexit: let us make our own decisions. Frexit would do the same.If I take my own area, I expect South Yorkshire county council to repair the road near my home because they are my immediate supplier of socialist activities and gather taxes from me for that purpose. I do not expect the large pot holes on Doncaster Road to remain there for months while applications are made to Brussels and permission sought and arguments made (sorry, the Romanian delegate had more persuasive arguments and anyway, the Latvians vetoed the bill) and all the while my car suspension goes south.Once you get a bigger organisation than necessary it gets caught up in matters that don’t help the organisation, or more relevantly, the people who contribute to it.PS as for Pompeii, another volcanic eruption should cover up all the good work done by the EU money in looking after it. The day the EU plugs Vesuvius I will take my hat off to them.

                @ UKer – The problem for the EU is our southern neighbors simply can’t fund their countries selling pasta, olive oil and bottle corks in today’s economy. Unfortunately they have neither the capability nor the resources which is why Germany, and to some degree France, remain the dominant financial drivers on this side of the Channel.In my eyes, the purpose of the EU should be to operate in some ways as the US Federal government operates in the US; where the individual states are responsible for local support (country roads, schools, etc) while the Federal government is responsible for federal highways, water ways, etc. The Americans hate to even mention the word, but it’s really a simple form of Socialism. Taxes from Californians pay for roads and upkeep for people in North Dakota and other low population states where their economies simply couldn’t do it alone. We all know German taxes help keep Spain and Portugal out of third world status. And I think that’s a good thing for everyone in the long run. I would hate to see Barcelona turn into Cairo – and if you’ve been to Cairo, you know what I’m talking about.If the EU is to have reliable transport of goods, I would not want to depend on the French or Italians to fund and maintain their own highways. Commerce depends on good infrastructure – roads, highways, bridges and rail systems – and with more and more coming from our eastern neighbors (Czech, Poland, Hungary, etc) all heading to ports like Calais, everyone benefits when everyone contributes.Personally, I would rather pay higher taxes to support our southern neighbors rather than seeing them take loans from a German bank or the World Bank. Imagine if a state like South Dakota had to borrow money to pay for it’s upkeep rather than receive tax revenue distributed from the other 49-states? It would be never ending dept just paying the interest given how few people actually live there.So from this perspective, tax distribution at a EU (Federal) level in Europe makes sense.

        I am not sure the economists believe that they can micromanage the economy.  Per the later part of the essay, they are telling their paying audience what they think the audience wants to hear, and then they hope that the results in the real world just happen to coincide with their proposals (so they can claim success).  It is all a Capital City scam, one end to the other.

            Yes, they do. Economists certainly believe they can micromanage an economy.And why shouldn’t they?They have reams of theoretical studies and “proofs” (all highly mathematical, therefore they must be correct) that they have it all figured out.Of course, NONE of their theories or proofs have been or can be subjected to controlled experiments and thus can never be proven wrong ( or right).But just toss enough econo lingo and math , and poof, it is all very clear.Add in the fact that most of them are liberal progressive elitists – hoping until the last that the economic system of the USSR would prevail – and you will find no shortage of the belief in their own abilities to predict and explain everything and anything in an economy.Oh, by the way, when their predictions prove wrong (only occurs about 90% of the time; really no big deal), they will always find some exogenous reason why the real world went wrong.Economists are never wrong.
