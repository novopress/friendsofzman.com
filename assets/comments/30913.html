        “Further, the Claremont view of politics leaves no room for race or even natural inequality.”
True regarding race but not true regarding natural inequality.

        Despite thousands of years of observable differences, individually, behaviorally and societally, these tads cling to the idea that we’re all more alike than not, all bleed red and with the right permutations, utopia wii be realized.  Maybe, just possibly maybe, if instead of umpteen millions of pieces of adult garbage flooding over the border, there were umpteen millions of newborn poc babies flooding into a homogeneous White country – maybe, just possibly maybe, virtuous citizens could be made of them, but I wouldn’t bet on it.  As a matter of fact, I’m F-ing tired of that BS continually getting shoved down our throats.

            Z: “Rufo does think race is a social construct and it must be eliminated from all discourse. This New Right imagined by Rufo, Claremont and others is not just colorblind, but colorless.”Well then Rufo fails the very first test [namely “physiognomy”] in the “hierarchy of argumentation” [credit PA]:https://tinyurl.com/attfftx3A few days ago, the UK Daily Mail had a photo essay of Sasha Obama, pretending to go shopping at a Target [I don’t know what the publicity agent was thinking when he/she/xher/they/them/it scheduled that gig]:https://tinyurl.com/5csy9nffThat poor girl is so homely I ackshually feel sorry for her.She doesn’t deserve to suffer like that.Compare her to her sister, Malia, who inherited the White genes in the fambly:https://tinyurl.com/ms4cjd9wIt’s not fair that one sister has to go through life looking like the offspring of a gori11a mating with a bridge troll, whereas the other sister gets invited to all the best soirees in Whiteyville.Race Mixing is an absolute abomination.I sincerely hope Stanley Ann Dunham is suffering appropriately for all eternity.

        “[Continetti] claims that the populists supporting nationalist policies and candidates are actually Marxists.”  “It is a hilariously insane line of thought…”I agree with Z Man because almost no one is a Marxist anymore.  But if Continetti had written “collectivist” instead of “Marxist,” then I think that he would be correct, to a first approximation.Although most whites naturally desire a culture of individual rights, we dissidents recognize that all other groups operate tribally and that individuals lose to tribes.  So, we must be outward-facing collectivists to have a hope of survival.The conservatives like Continetti want a culture of atomized individuals, but in practice this is only imposed on whites.  Whites are atomized individuals while everyone else is a member of a tribe.  Continetti is an interesting example.  While born a gentile, he is married to Bill Kristol’s daughter.  He even converted to judaism before the marriage.  He has a tribe but he doesn’t want me to have one.

            There are two groups of whites…There are those who recognize that in these times, your skin color is your uniform, mostly male…And there are those who believe in an egalitarian heaven, where despite a few thousand murders by blacks here and there, blacks and whites are the same…mostly women…Since our society has gone crazed feminist, the latter view dominates, despite the ugly reality that a tiny percentage of the population, young black men, commits most of the violent crime in the US…But in the elite circles of Conservatism Inc. none of these things can even be discussed.

                I don’t know about that,I suppose it’s who you consider elite.To me, those who have been in the trenches for years have earned respect, in my way of thinking are the “elite”
Jared Tayler, Peter Brimalo and his lovely wife Lydia. John Derbyshire not to mention the Zman. Do not seem to shy away from facts as they are. Thankfully there are others coming along that are standing on these giants shoulders as well.

        The Right will always be a loser as long as it adopts the morality of the Left. I expect about this time next year the Republicans will crow that Democrats are the real transphobes and pedophilephobes. Nothing will save the West short of near complete collapse. China could help us out with enough EMP blasts to destroy all digital electronics. Russia could help us out with nuclear strikes that wipe out DC, and all of the east and west coast metroplolises, most all of New England &amp; New York, Chicago &amp; Minneapolis.

        Once you assume that morality is an objective truth that lies outside of collective agreement, it means there can be only one truly moral way to organize human society.
So is morality a SUBJECTIVE truth?
Conscience is identical in each human.  But it can be beaten to death.

        Whatever anyone’s gripes with Rufo, he is certainly doing a lot of good work (e.g. in Florida, helping DeSantis roll back Disney and left-wing power) and is not afraid to go on the attack. In my view, he is someone to be supported despite our differences. He’s someone making a real-world difference in our favor, not stirring up controversy and pocketing the proceeds. We can save the discussion with him on race until after the revolution.

Precisely. And it’s going to be a very short discussion. I’m sick of these people.

                Short and a monologue. In fact, it won’t be a discussion at all, but rather an ultimatum. Embrace race reality or begone. Nothing more to it than that.

        This introduces for me the question of suffering. Maybe Christopher Rufo is seeking to reduce the suffering of his children by denying the existence of race. I don’t know the mindset of people like Jared Taylor or John Derbyshire but did these two gentlemen expect their children wouldn’t suffer for their race-mixing? I assume they married their spouses when they were at a different place in their journey of discovery of the reality of race. That is the most benign interpretation so I assume it to be true. But it wouldn’t surprise me at all if at some point one or more of their children upon reaching adulthood lash out publicly at their fathers for having caused them to suffer a crisis of identity. Of course they wouldn’t couch it in those terms.Suffering is a multilatitudinous subject beyond the scope of this comment. I was acquainted last night on this topic through this youtube video, which is bizarre. This woman calls herself an Anti-Natalist, which isn’t what you think.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw0PYbG1eyUI can tell at a glance why she might not want to have children and pass on her suffering. I don’t agree with anything she says but coming, as she obviously does, from the perspective of a certain Bronze age death-cult, I think I can hone in on the root cause of her suffering.Suffering can be easily avoided along one broad avenue of suffering — race-mixing. Not that I’m trying to be some special snow-flake, but why would you burden your child with this any more than you would by endowing them with an odd cross-sexual name such as Daphne for a boy or Howard for a girl? Or even endorsing their descent into transgender madness fueled by a fanatical teacher or school administrator? People are weird.

            Derbyshire and Rufo both married Chinese women. Rufo’s wife is Thai Chinese (mean IQ ~100), not some peasant just hopped out of a paddy field.Both of them married into the smart fraction of a civilised race with more cultural continuity than that of all here present. We may not all of us want to live surrounded by Chinese (although I happen to live that way at present and rather enjoy clean subways and being able to walk the streets in perfect safety at 3am. YMMV), but I don’t see them as race traitors. Coal Burning and David Frenching or giving money to PragerU are what being a race traitor is.Both cases can’t deny race inside the privacy of their heads for the simple reason that blacks predate upon Asians even more than they do upon Whites. I know more about Derb from reading his copious writings. He travelled far and wide in his youth and lived on his wits — most Americans have no real experience of the world outside and just either love it or hate it depending their ideology du jour. If he found his wife ‘out there’ whilst having adventures, well and good for him. As for Rufo’s story… who knows? But does anyone seriously think he’d suddenly pop up interviewing Thomas777 if he’d married someone looked like a Shield Maiden? I don’t. He’s too comfy where he is.

                In simplest terms, Taylor seems more focused on intelligence and Derbyshire seems more focused on safety, correct me if I’m wrong. I don’t know anything about Rufo. In neither of the former two cases however are their concerns at odds with marrying into an Asiatic culture. But I think there’s more to it than only these two issues of intelligence and safety alone.

            Tom K, the world is full of mixed people. Travel to central Asia for example, and many are what we’d call Hapa. Or visit Vancouver or Hawaii for that matter. The East Asian and European has blended for millennia.
I invite you to go to Kyrgyzstan or Yakutia and ask the first person you meet if they’re suffering because they’re not 100% Chinese. Ask them if they want to spit on their father.

        &gt;… it is tempting to think Rufo’s act is an effort to avoid the R-word.This is a reasonable suspicion, but it does not appear to be the case with Rufo nor the other popular figures from Claremont.I can’t speak to the Rufo case but this does appear to be an issue for the Claremont crowd. I’ve spoken to a couple of these guys and they didn’t push back on my hbd observations in private. Going full hbd is probably a bridge too far for any mainstream organization with normie donors, especially one based in California.They’ve already stuck their necks out plenty in supporting Trump. John Eastman, a major figure at Claremont, is in a heap of trouble with the Feds now. The neocons hate Claremont with a passion.In Schmitt‘s friend/enemy world, Claremont and even Rufo are on the friend side. Sure, they act as gatekeepers but they may come around eventually. In the meantime, NEOTR applies.

            Claremont is the last stop on the train from Normieville before you get to the DR wilderness (at least it was for me).  As such it is half heretic and half gatekeeper (although these days it tends to outsource the thought policing to the folks at Hillsdale).The neocons hate Claremont for many reasons, going back to the original schism between the east coast and west coast Straussians, and the Walter Berns-Harry Jaffa feud (not all east coast Straussians are neocons, but all neocons are east coast Straussians).More recently, the Claremonsters intellectually legitimized Trump, a crime  the neocons will never forgive. Although Trump was arguably the most pro-Israel president in history, he was against the broader neocon project of promoting tikkun olam with the American military. Not coincidentally, Trump was also the first President since Calvin Coolidge who was not dependent on financing from the usual suspects.Claremont may be a useful way station on the road to Damascus, but its obsessive fetish for ephemeral rights, and its obstinate refusal to acknowledge the realities of race makes it an intellectual and political dead end.

        There is another reason for the aversion to race. Rufo is a science-denier. He rejects biology as we know it. He worked for the Discovery Institute, which peddles crackpot theories like intelligent design. Of course, the Claremont people largely reject the last two thousand years of scientific progress. They instead embrace the Straussian belief that nature comes with a secret code book on how humans should act. If you say Aristotle’s name enough times, the secret is revealed.The starting place for the New Right is the assumption that humans are infinitely malleable in terms of character. What you are as a person is determined by the society into which you are born. If you get the moral code of society right and enforce that morality through the institutions, you end up with virtuous citizens. Since virtue in their view is a life lived to the benefit of the polis, there can be no place for things like race, because that undermines their idea of virtue.If this sounds a bit like Marxism, it should, because this is the basic assumption of Marx and most radical thinkers. Once you assume that morality is an objective truth that lies outside of collective agreement, it means there can be only one truly moral way to organize human society.I have no idea what Rufo-ism or whether there are any valid criticisms of it, but I do know that both the description of it given here, and the arguments raised against it, are articulated within a language that is very philosophically misinformed, and consequently the above paragraphs are rather confused. If this is an accurate description of Rufo’s position, then Rufo does not understand Aristotle and Z-Man did not bother to correct him on that. But of course, we know from prior posts that Z-Man does not understand Aristotle either, so whatever misunderstanding thee was originally is now amplified.In the first place, Aristotle does not reject race, so adducing an infatuation with Aristotle as a reason for Rufo’s alleged race-rejection is something of a bizarre claim to begin with. Likewise, Aristotle would not have had any truck whatsoever with “intelligent design,’ which would have to go beggingly to Democritus and Leucippus were it seeking for philosophical friends in the ancient world. Intelligent design, unacknowledged by its adherents, is a thoroughgoingly materialist proposition which differs from Darwinism only in proposing a deliberate rather than a random process for generating organisms. Aristotle’s notion of substantial forms is equally opposed to both types of materialism, so there’s no help for Rufo or Z-Man there, either.Moving on, the idea that “human character is infinitely malleable” is about as far from Aristotle as it is possible to be. There is simply no way to understand Aristotelian ethics or even Aristotelian terminology that is compatible with infinite malleability. The whole notion of final causality, which is the basis of Aristotelian virtue, implies a movement towards a definite state of perfection, and of course the same could be said about the formal cause, teleology, habit, and so on. It is not arbitrary rules that determine what is good for man or for society, but the nature of man and society determine what is good for them. If this plain and simple description of virtue excludes any understanding of race, it certainly would have been news to Aristotle, who frequently contrasted the vicious behavior of barbarian tribes with the standards expected for well brought up Greeks.But even apart from these inaccuracies, the most bizarre statement above is the internal contradiction where Aristotle is first blamed for introducing infinite malleability into human ethics and then blamed for the idea that morality is objective and there is only one right way to organize society. I have a hard time believing that these two paragraphs were written near to one another. Such a garbled description does not shed light on anything and it means that the name Aristotle is just being used here as a bugaboo with no thought to the underlying concepts.Morality is not about “organizing society” at all. Morality is about perfecting the appetitive faculties so that they rightly use the objects of natural desire. This is of course “objective” in the sense that the state of perfection is a real quality, but it is not in the same category as social organization.The explanation for these twisting thoughts is that Z is desperate to make “race” into something more significant than it is, so that it can be used as a social standard, as either a totem to be defended or a quality that substitutes for virtue. But this cannot be done without doing violence to virtue and politics, which is why these concepts are always so readily and recklessly thrown in the trash here.

            Bro, you’re my favorite commentor here. Holy shit though. So many words.
I think Z means regarding the idea of natural right with Aristotle.
But like those he damns by saying they just say Aristotle’s name like a magic spell, he only crudely waves his hand to ward away having to deal with the theory of natural right.

            The ID’ers make the claim that God regularly steps into his creation and makes changes, sort of like the bug fixes that you get from every app you use on your computer. To address the badger problem, God inspired man to breed dachshunds but that process could never ever be used by nature itself to create the platypus.It is perfectly reasonable to say that God created the universe and the rules that make it possible. Things like fitness are part of those rules God created. It is unreasonable to argue that God was a terrible workman and is endlessly stepping in to patch his mistakes by creating new species.

I’m not arguing with the logic of your statement, but for whatever it’s worth, you have to admit that in Judaism and in Christianity God is alleged to have done exactly that. He despaired of creating Man and decided to wipe out the species with the Flood, except for Noah and his family.
Then, he despaired at having wiped out so many people and vowed never to do it again. Instead He sent his “only begotten son” to save Man.

A cursory analysis of youtube indicates that many animals masturbate, and engaging in such sinful behavior could easily cause them to evolve incorrectly and require divine intervention to correct.

            In short, creationism does not equal intelligent design movement. The term, ID, has been around for centuries, but the modern movement, which is what Z is clearly referring to, is one that argues, basically, that evolution is simply God’s continual molding of humanity. To further clarify, the ID guys claim to go for teleology rather than etiology.

            Young earth creationism, which is probably what their ID theory is, is utterly retarded and thoroughly dishonest. As far as I know, is both unscientific and unscriptural besides.Take Michael Behe for example. He introduced a concept he calls “irreducible complexity” and uses an analogy to an outboard motor with reference to how certain bacteria get around. He says, if you remove any single part of the assembly, you end up with an assembly that doesn’t do anything and is therefore wasteful to carry around part of an assembly in nonworking condition for however long it takes to evolve the missing pieces.  However, other biologists show how this is not actually what he thinks it is and there are examples of bacteria with only some of the outboard engine parts, but which function in a different way. This proves irreducible complexity is false, at least in this example he uses.  But he behaves as if he has never seen this rebuttal (he definitely has seen it). Till this day he uses this example and just pretends it’s relevant.He uses another analogy to a mousetrap. He says a regular mousetrap needs all 5 parts to capture a mouse. That if you remove any part of the trap, it will no longer function.  This was also proven false with a working mousetrap having 1 2 and even all but 2 removed. Again, he just pretends he never heard of it, despite it being demonstrated right in front of him on a debate stage.  I have never heard of a YEC who wasn’t thoroughly dishonest. Most of the good ones gave up a long time ago, so we get grifters like Ray Comfort and his douchey sidekick.,

        If this “new right” seeks to remove race from the discussion, then it has already failed. Because The Regime has decided that Race is front and center, overriding all other concerns save sexual deviancy, the conflicts with which it is still working out. So Rufo-ism is not going anywhere, and has no hope of being the new Buckley-ism, which by definition has to operate within The Regime’s frame.
For this reason, The Regime itself is probably the best recruiter for the DR that we have.

            Great comment. Agree. It fits in with a recent Z-Man point – maybe yesterday? That is that the clock is running out. At 80% majority things could be frittered away. At 57%, heavily skewed older and much lower percentages the lower age brackets you get into, and the time for Rufo-ism is out. He will shift the Overton window and that is good. But the enemy has defined the uniform and the real battle. The battle isn’t an idea, as Rufo thinks it is. The battle is presented is for the subjugation if not eradication of an ethnos/race for political power. Colorblind is throwing down your weapons and tying your hand behind your back marching uphill to meet the foe.The regime will be the best recruiter. The DR needs to be a pilot fish on the Rufos and Brodows … … Their audience is our future ranks and we have to wisely use their social media to get their audience to look up and see us on the shore ahead while they look back and see the regime’ hordes behind them.

        The strange thing calling itself “Conservative” in this country was always a synthetic agenda written by business lobbyists, intel / warmonger types, Israel partisans and low-tax liberals, i.e. libertarians.It co-opted and used traditional white middle-class opinion while actually working against it.  It also crowded out older, truly conservative philosophies and legitimized a global American empire in the name of anti-communism.  Nonsensically they even continue the anti-communism…they accuse present-day cultural radicals (foot soldiers for globalized capital) of being communists.This deception worked for decades but as Z-Man points out the people who put it all this together now know their brand is expiring.  The election of Donald Trump proved that.The ‘New Right’ so-called is an effort by “Conservatism, Inc” to harness the new online right and the recapture the older right.  Like any good deception, it uses a lot of truth.  In many cases they’ll even take a couple steps into forbidden territory to gain credibility (speaking on inner-city black dysfunction, for instance).  They’ve jettisoned free-trade dogmatism, but not open borders.  They rightly grant that Christianity and the classics are sources of wisdom, character and social order.  But they gloss over describing the civilization that spread Christianity, or who wrote the classics.These phony New Right people write very little that is outright incorrect.  Instead they walk normies right up to the line of wrong-think, and then turn them sharply away from it only at the last second.  Quite the game they are running.  Hard even to say whether it’s good or bad for true dissidents, in my view.For examples of this weird genre check out “American Mind” or “IM-1776”

            I think that’s one part of how I got here, being exposed to that stuff that walks you right up to “the line.” I reached some of my big dissident conclusions on my own, others I had to be led.
The big dissident conclusion I reached on my own, the one I think supersedes and overrides all the others, the one that holds up even if all the others are false: When whites are a minority, no other group is going to stick up for them

            Good comment. I’ve seen this ethos of 60s Merseybeat riff-copping going around this week with all the bombastic essays which frame the Hamas clusterbang as New 9/11. I cannot believe this effort is targeted primarily at an audience old enough to remember Previous 9/11. I am thinking the only proper military response is a Zombie Christopher Hitchens/Andrew Sullivan “Not In Our Name” stand-up comedy tour.

            All modern leftist thought is communist derived. Every “theory” that emanated out of the universities is a different variety of the class dialectic that Marx proposed, altered by the Frankfurt school into oppressor/oppressed dialectic, and applied to race, gender, sex, etc. etc.So yea, “conservatives” are going to use communists, because it fits.That being said, doing so isn’t a good strategy, since the term commie doesn’t carry moral stigma any more, thanks to the media assassination of Joe McCarthy. Who, by the way, was later proven absolutely 100% correct, but THAT bit of news doesn’t ever penetrate The Official Narrative™ surrounding the HUAC.

        As a businessman, I cannot help but look at this “New Right”/old Right-Paleocon/DR/CN conflict as a battle for “market share” and funding. And for sure, Zman has addressed the Grift of the pseud-Right on many occasions. But I still think that business considerations dominate this conflict.Overtly addressing race realities is not going to raise money these days, period. So all the combatants search for an optimal strategy at the intersection of what they believe and what can be sold to donors.We need room for practical action. Regarding Rufo, the old Chi-com Deng Xiaoping cleverly addressed these ideological conflicts. Quoth the pragmatist Deng: “I don’t care if the cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice”. So I guess that’s my view of Rufo. He’s caught some mice.

            In my experience with think-tank guys, they follow the money, but are also true beleivers. Oftentimes, they take the money and accept the compromise of softening their original views. Over time, they start to sincerely believe what the money tells them to believe, even if it is dramatically different than their original views.
The only way out of their malaise isn’t facts and reason, but humiliation. Once the mental degredation of being an online clown is worse than potentially not having a paycheck, they shift our way.

            They cannot address race because they don’t believe in race.  In their minds, they see race as nothing but superficial differences that are literally skin/appearance deep.  When they look at various peoples across the world, they see different looking versions of White people.  The idea that peoples separated for 10s of thousands of years might have differences far beyond superficial appearance is completely alien to them.
Step 1 is to get them to understand race is real and far deeper than skin color. Frankly, they need to understand skin color is not race.

                “When they look at various peoples across the world, they see different looking versions of White people.”Precisely this. It is pathological egoism. Western liberal whites — and I’m including conservative under my definition of “liberal” in the broader sense — believe that everyone on earth wants to be like them. Just like them. Have the same interests, the same habits, the same frame of mind toward the world, life, death, etc.It is insanity. I have discovered this in the past decade through deep dives with friends over cigars in front of fireplaces. They truly believe that all human beings want to be *them*, to have what they have, and who am I to deny others those things? Very, very unsettling conversations that changed my view of friends long before Covid (but which further cemented it).

        Let them have their highfalutin debates about morality, politics, and the way things ought to be in their idealized vision of society. Let them dance on the internet exchanging virtuous articles describing their “unique” nuance, all the while collecting sinecures like a dog biscuits. It matters not, the enabling affluence that fuels this insanity is about to go the way of the turd in the toilet bowl. And when hardship arrives, they will learn that you cannot eat puerile propaganda for breakfast.I have no use for people-of-grift who possess no redeeming attributes beyond wordism. Even arguing with them is a waste of breadth. In the fullness of time, they are evolutionary dead-ends. The world is heating up and time is a-wastin. Best to get fit and stock up. Put the shotgun by the front door.

            That’s the thing in that even if what they believed was 100% true it would also be irrelevant.  For instance, it’s like the aging posters claiming that black crime is caused by absentee fathers, because whatever reasons they’re espousing are not going to impact my belief in separating black criminals from society.

            Just so. Tribes have been here for tens of thousands of years and will be with us long after the New Right shuffles off to yon historical slagheep (I give it less than 20 years). Race denial is the ultimate Sisyphean project. These people would rather work themselves to death than accept a reality that is plain as eggs.

        That article from Continetti does the usual trick, which is that “if you don’t believe in endless foreign wars, then you must believe America is a force for bad in the world, then you are just like Ilhan Omar!” It’s a trick that worked for decades, but really does not anymore because people are stepping outside of this frame. Now people say “I don’t want America to do foreign wars because it’s bad for America and Americans.” They really don’t have a counter to that, and when they do, it devolves into Haley/Pence-esque gibberish and nonsense. Every single day, we engage in billions of dollars worth of trade to China, why are we picking a fight with them? It doesn’t make sense.So it is with race. For what it is worth, I do not think Rufo-ism is going to take hold, because people are willing to step out of the colorblind frame we have been forced into since at least the CRA. You have to be willfully blind to not see the color of American crime in the cities, and when you see something like ZERO students in Baltimore’s school system with math proficiency, well it’s not hard to draw the obvious conclusions. And if you draw those conclusions, then Rufo-ism falls apart.Years of this rhetoric and a generation of people who were simply afraid to be called names by their enemy led to this situation, but it sure seems like younger people are not as afraid. Maybe it is because of years of trolling and being trolled online, but it’s a different ballgame.

            Good post but you’re wrong here:“You have to be willfully blind to not see the color of American crime in the cities, and when you see something like ZERO students in Baltimore’s school system with math proficiency, well it’s not hard to draw the obvious conclusions. And if you draw those conclusions, then Rufo-ism falls apart.”You are giving people too much credit for accepting reality.  Reality is never the answer to most people.  Instead it’s “systemic racism”, or “poverty”.  All of my conservative friends will do this.  They will blame it on poverty and the hard life in the inner cities.  Then point to some successful black guy they know as proof.It’s still way too uncomfortable for conservatards to accept that the blaq is a violent, low IQ destructive force.Most white people are like this.  Hell, just look at the shitlibs who recently got dispatched by their beloved diversity.  Even death isn’t enough.  Even take a look at the family of the police chief who was run over by the future engineers.  Anything and everything to not make it about race.

                “ Anything and everything to not make it about race.”Yes, a question I’ve pondered often.  To me it seems obvious—so why am I in such a minority.  Truth is not a matter of consensus.  What our forefathers knew instinctively, we’ve proven over and over again via modern scientific method.One theory I have is the pseudo explanations for racial “diversity” are a coping mechanism—a drowning man’s last grasp at the straw.  If such differences—bad ones at least—are innate, then what hope is there for change, peaceful change?No, better to believe in a sweet lie.  That, coupled with our own genetic proclivity wrt openness and trust (as vs ethnocentrism) and here we are today.

                    ‘“ Anything and everything to not make it about race.” Yes, a question I’ve pondered often. To me it seems obvious—so why am I in such a minority.’IMO, it’s the brainwashing. News stories about black crime are suppressed, ignored, or excused. Stories about white “crime” (even in the form of self-defense) are amplified and condemned. Entertainment media is awash with smart, kind, civilized blacks. Even commercials portray blacks as responsible home-owners while whites are the masked intruders looking to rob them.It would be funny if it weren’t so effective. But once you see it, you can’t unsee it.Our main problem is that our enemies control the news media, the entertainment media, the schools, and the national discourse. And oh, yeah, our politicians and courts.In light of this, it’s a wonder that any of us are awake.

                        @Winter –You are spot on.  I had a conversation with a left wing friend a while back about all things jab, black crime and racial preferences.  He didn’t believe that anyone got fired for refusing the shot.  I of course brought it up right after he went on a rant about “my body, my choice”.  It painted him into a corner so he couldn’t disagree with my view on the jab without risking his house of cards.When I told him that black people can score much lower on civil service tests he didn’t believe that either.  He had a big problem though, my cousin, who is a long time NYC firefighter was right there to back up the claims.  Wrong again.Then there was the issue of black crime.  This is always the big one.  Zero white people are killed by blacks according to this retard.  Zero – because the leftist media he follows doesn’t tell him it ever happens.  He also lives in an 85% white suburb.  There is very little diversity, so how the fuck would he know what the effects are?  I started sending him news stories of innocent whites being hacked, shot, murdered by blacks.  In the beginning he admitted that he was shocked, then he just got angry and that ended the friendship.Again – you can show them the proof, they can see it in front of them, but they will refuse to accept it.  You can refuse to believe that sitting in direct sunlight on the beach will give you sunburn and skin cancer all you want, but reality begs to differ.  Like Z says, it is undefeated.

                Very few people can handle Capital R Reality 100% of the time without going utterly insane. So they choose (probably unconsciously) which parts of Reality to deal with and which parts not to. Additionally each individual has a their own bearable amount of Reality fraction. Some much less than others.This goes for us on the DR, too.From 10,000 feet up, one might break it down into two axes and say it’s  a question of which religion you follow and how psychopathic you are 🙂Our enemies worship at the altar of the Successor Ideology, we are mostly Christian or follow the Old Gods or take our consolation from the Classics. As for who is more psychopathic… of course it’s those prog @#$%ers and we all know what needs to be done with them 😀

            While they will migrate elsewhere and use other tactics, this election is the death rattle of neoconservatism.

The former is dying off and not being replaced, the latter soon will have no market and will be selling vitamin supplements.

            The DR is larger than it was just a decade or two ago. But outside the DR, a “racist” is beneath a murderer. Keep that in mind if you are inclined to proselytize. Murderers have well funded and organized movements to exonerate them. There is no such apparatus for “racists.” So it’s hard to say if we’re really making progress.

                That’s why I never talk of such things in terms of race.  Point out unspecified “others” and let the listener come to his own conclusions as to whom (classification) those others are.  If he can’t come to just who they are as a racial grouping, then he is not ready for the DR.Just yesterday I had such a discussion at lunch.  The conversation drifted toward professional graduate studies such as law and medicine.  All that needed to be discussed was the lowering of entry standards and graduation/certification standards—such as CA doing away with the bar exam—to keep numbers of doctors and lawyers rolling off the production line.  No disagreement as to the folly of this and the future repercussions to society was offered.If the seed is planted, it will grow.  You don’t need to walk around wearing a sign board stating “The end is near!”

                    I, and all my children have been diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome. We are all have tested IQ’s in the mid to upper 130’s. One thing we have in common is that we have exceptional bullshit detectors and cannot abide people who are willfully ignorant of facts and obvious realities. Consequently we all have been called racist, unfeeling and accused of not having a heart. Fortunately, due to the above mentioned advantageous genetic mutation(?) we just don’t care. It is amazing how clear things are when that happens.

            I don’t want “America” to do foreign wars simply because it is now the Evil Empire of Perversity and Diversity, and I don’t want it to inject more of its cultural strychnine into the veins of other nations. Furthermore, if “America” is no longer expanding, it is probably contracting, and that contraction, hopefully, will be absolute.

        “He claims that the populists supporting nationalist policies and candidates are actually Marxists.”As someone who’s been intermittently accused by f being a commie for the last, idk, 30 years, LOL.“the New Left was never an economic or purely political movement, but a cultural and spiritual movement.”Sometimes I think it’s as simple as people doing drugs in college.“Once you assume that morality is an objective truth that lies outside of collective agreement, it means there can be only one truly moral way to organize human society. The goal of politics, therefore, is to discover it and then ruthlessly enforce it. Instead of historical materialism as the moral authority, the New Right embraces their interpretation of classical philosophy.”Truth and discover are the key words. Logic, idealism at bottom. Answers demanded; no room for humility and mystery. It’s a sperg-out.

        The UN, NGOs and the U.S. Government are importing an army of tens of millions.  We will see how Rufo and his fellow travelers fair when this army is ultimately activated.   When the time comes what these people will unleash will make the attacks in Israel look like a picnic.
We will see if these people can see race then.    The fact is it may be the last thing they see.

            Camp of the Saints was decried as a ” an example of racist fantasy at its worse”. Maybe, but it’s also proving to be prophetical, even according to the Biblical standard. That crazy Frenchman had everything right, chapter and verse. Even when they are dropping off cruise ship loads of vibrancy in Martha’s Vineyard in some near future, the people in charge will still be making excuses for why accepting them into our homes is the “Christian” thing to do. I believe in Jesus, but the organized church holds the same place in my heart as the DOJ, IRS and EEOC.

        If you get the moral code of society right and enforce that morality through the institutions, you end up with virtuous citizens. Since virtue in their view is a life lived to the benefit of the polis, there can be no place for things like race, because that undermines their idea of virtue.
If this sounds a bit like Marxism, it should, because this is the basic assumption of Marx and most radical thinkers.
It also sounds like Christian nationalism.

                All it takes to be a perfect Christian is to confess your belief in Jesus and poof! You’re free of sin! It’s essentially the same stone age recipe employed by the poultry-swingers, except you don’t get a chicken dinner afterwards.This is what allows con men like Jordan Peterson, Milo Yiannopoulos and David Rubin to get a free pass for their degenerate lifestyle.I despair at how easy it is to fool Christians. Watching a smirking George H. Bush or a Bill Clinton or Donald Trump talk about Jesus almost makes me want to take the Jesus-pill so I can legitimately burn them at the stake.

They’re all atheists – just like Jordan, Milo and Rubin – that was my point.
I’d add Andrew Torba to the list. One fine day he suddenly catches the Jesus-bug and now he’s all about scripture and hellfire?
As a lifelong atheist, I can usually spot a fellow traveler from miles away, while Christians are shockingly naive about fake Christians.

                        I’d argue for Peterson as a true believer.  He really does not need to be a Christian poseur.  He made his “bones” well before any need to attract a religious audience and never in his prior career am I aware of such proselytizing on his part.
I’d say his political tribulations and resulting persecution made him become a believer.  To this effect, I assume he found relief in Belief.

                        @CompsciYou ask me, Peterson rings more fake than Milo. I don’t even think I’ve actually heard him say he believes in God. When you ask him, he’ll give you ten minutes of rhetorical fan dance only to talmudically demand “what do you mean by ‘God’ and what do you mean by ‘believe&#x27;”?

Jesus, Jordan! It’s not a trick question!
As for the confession of the lips, yes that wouldn’t work on God obviously, but it works like a charm on Evangelicals.

                        Belief in Jesus as solely needed for salvation is a sticking point and I would say not always as pronounced as in modern times.  However, such is not found outside Christianity to my understanding.  Seems atheists have quite a bent to fault/reference Christianity.Jews for example have a bit more realistic interpretation of “Hashem” and good and bad deeds.  Rabbis often talk about good deeds cancelling bad deeds in God’s eyes.  I myself prefer the accounting ledger understanding myself.Also, if one looks, one can find Rabbis discussing irreconcilable differences between Jews and Christians—one of which is the deification of a man (Jesus) as God, rather than a profit of the one God.

        Conservatism and this latest strain are best analyzed through psychology rather than philosophy. Even in the most race-aware societies such as Israel, Japan, Korea, and China, slight deviance from mainstream thought engenders tremendous fear and encourages other conformity. Antiracist/color blind thought simply is the mirror image. Dig deeper into the mental milieu, and the realities of gender emerge with women seeking even more conformity and men showing flashes of independence.As you write from time to time, reality is the thing that doesn’t go away when you stop believing in it. Ignoring reality is the only solution, then, except when the rubber hits the road and Christopher Rufo has to decide whether to dine with his multi-racial family on either Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd. or General Robert E. Lee Parkway. Then excuses have to be made for reality, whether they be systemic racism or the harms of CRT.Again, it takes the shrink’s couch rather than a familiarity with Greek thought to get to the root of why. Sometimes experience and events fill the void, but even then you have mothers of beautiful white boys slain by feral blacks telling the public their dead child was not a racist. In other contexts, such disassociation would require involuntary committal. In that one, other mentally ill people nod along or take glee in the humiliation ritual.

There’s actually a government agency that swoops in when this happens and cajoles the grieving family into self-flagellating themselves. That’s why all the stuggle sessions sound the same. Disgusting doesn’t even begin to describe it.

                        It’s a small agency that operates under the umbrella of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. I first became aware of them in the aftermath of the Michael “Gentle Giant” Brown getting his just rewards for trying to relieve a cop of his service pistol.
Like many things fucked up today, they really came into their own during the Obama administration, probably because his people hired as many radical race hustlers as they could to staff the Executive branch. PJ Media had a very good long going expose exposing all the activists hired, and their backgrounds.

                        Thanks. While nothing shocks me any longer, this comes close. Families need to covertly film and release government attempts to encourage them to let the murdering savages off the hook. Learning things like this allows us to realize what seem to be exaggerated claims of white genocide are not and in fact the federal government may be its most active participant. I’m getting a feeling the response to the Hamas attacks are far more muted than would have been the case just a few years ago, so maybe the worm is turning some because far more monstrous things occur here 24/7/365.

        Wouldn’t dispute anything in here other than to acknowledge why Rufo appeals to so many.
Americans love a winner and that’s what Rufo appears to be. He has, in fact, landed body blows on CRT and its supporters. He has achieved more in the last two years than Con Inc. did in the last two decades.
That’s to damn with faint praise, of course. But that he did this without acknowledging the reality of race just demonstrates how maliciously useless Con Inc. is.
Great post though.

            Has it won any battles? In the corporate and government space, the antiracism rackets roll on unabated by any of this. Maybe there has been some success in the schools, I don’t know, but I am not seeing much winning here. That said, I think the willingness to fight this stuff and do so in a way that avoids the dreaded R-word may be the main appeal. While Conservative Inc. demurs, these new guys are willing to fight and that at least has the charm of novelty.

                This is a great point. The CRT crowd is consolidating its gains. It is most consolidated in the military in fact and race quotas to keep whites a minority of officers is before Congress.A couple of anecdotes on the mentality. Rufo gives the wishful thinkers hope as do these compaints and whining sessions that the wishful thinkers use to masquerade as some victory. I have a good friend whose line is, “this stuff isn’t popular and it is going out.” I point him the truth and he has no reply.Apparently in a genocide both sides participate in a denial that it is happening. Rufo and Claremont are pursuing ideas. They are that long extinct band of brothers who committed to preserving an ideal as a conquering band surrounded them, cut off their food supply and then, weakened, were eradicated for all time.It is hard to tell if they are intentionally a part of the weakening of the men of the realm or a victim of it. In any case they are aiding and abetting The European/American Deuteronomy.

                Exactly this. The Supreme Court can strike down affirmative action in all forms, the FedGov can pass legislation doing the same, and every state in the Union could follow suit and yet it still won’t matter. Diversity is now so deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric of America’s educational, governmental, and corporate institutions that it’s impossible to weed out at this point. Affirmative action will continue unabated, albeit under the banner of diversity.For exactly this reason, I no longer believe this is a hill for us to die on, or even to fight to try to hold. That battle is lost, and changing demographics will ensure that it remains lost. Better to focus on building separate, parallel institutions which are not beholden to implementing the programs of the left.

                    The government is the least “woke” institution in America, last to adopt the official religion. The Supreme Court is a fluke holdout, ruling at a country that doesn’t exist—rightly ignored.As the news gleefully informed us recently, 94% of corporate hires this decade have been of non-whites. The military hopes to catch up to that someday, but for now it’ll settle for us “aging out.”The Biden border flood doesn’t compare to the hundred million already brought to us by Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Service, etc. “The government bribed them to do it!” Bribed a church? *Every* church? Hm.The Rufo/DeSantis show is worse than nothing. They disguise total loss (already accomplished) as marginal victory—because it is still *just* possible to nibble at some decorative fringes of the state. We can’t pick who’s president or whether we’re at war or anything like that, but occasionally one copy of a gay porn book for kids gets put behind the counter.

                    Good post, and I upvoted it. However, parallel instutions can accomplish nothing in a milieu that is monolithically hostile to them. Rather than worry about parallel institutions, the best thing to do is to sort ourselves into discrete racial blocs, await AINO’s inevitable collapse, and then take fullest advantage when it happens.

        &gt; This is an important part of Rufo-ism and the milieu that spawned it. These are people who are opposed to any discussion of race. It is not that they oppose the New Left’s view on race but that they embrace the New Left’s view on race more completely and sincerely than the Left embraces it.Rufo’s thoughts here are disappointing, as it would be easy for him to ignore race while supporting implicitly pro-white policies. A few dissidents more or less follow this path in order to get traction in more mainstream articles while maintaining plausible deniability about their views on some taboo subjects.The problem is Rufo is a true believer in colorblindness, and will change from ally to enemy once the winds change in the direction of biological reality. Still, even with this fault, he has been more effective in getting pro-white policies in place than almost anyone else, and he got so beat up with counter-signaling the dissident right a while ago he learned to keep his mouth shut there. For now, he is doing far more good than bad, so we’re better off letting him cook.

            Yes. These guys play a role of shifting the Overton Window in the direction of the real answers and solutions to the anti-white project. I think what they like more than being colorblind is avoiding conflict. This is a denial and a conflict avoidance strategy. Conflict is here it just won’t be kinetic as long as the aggressors face no real opposition.The IQ stuff is too narrow of an argument and most will never bite on it. The issue is the greater reality of biology and sub-species conflict over territory and control. At the bottom of all of this is that conflict. That is the key to success as it will jolt to life the existential primal urges of self defense. White people are not going to believe they are born superior to some and inferior to others. What they will believe and respond to is the reality of losing opportunity, the murders, name calling, white erasure and other things in their face day-to-day. The emotional appeal is in tying these every day events they see into the very real existential threat that lies behind and at the end of these things.The color of crime; the color of 2nd class citizenship; the total overlap of our predicament with the natural process of extinction (loss of territory/habitat; predation; hybridization; cratering fertility) needs to be clearly shown over and over. This is the emotional appeal to the survival instinct that will drown out the suicidal continuation of sacrificing reality for maintaining an idea that is at the heart of Rufo-ism.

                The sad truth is that different races and ethnicities typically do not get along and do better in separate countries or territories. The old multi-ethnic European states (consisting of all white people) were held together by authoritarian kings and emperors. The abolition of those empires and the resulting multi-ethnic republics were cauldrons of conflict.Even relatively slight differences (e.g., Croat and Serb) set people at one another’s throats. Modern multi-cult America can expect no less.

                    True. We like to talk about Race (and we should), but Ethnicity is another thing again and Ethnogenesis can occur *very* fast.Three examples of this happening:(1) The Managerial Class and their flunkies achieving class self-awareness and closing up ranks through assortative mating and increasing credentialism. This happened in the space of 100 years and has gone exponential in the last 30 years.(2) Hong Kong Chinese cf. their cousins just across the border in Guangdong Province — been brewing since 1949 but only went exponential in the 2010s.(3) Palestinians — Bunch of unloved by all (incl. other Arabs) bandit fellaheen  before the Irgun and Stern gang showed up and started massacring them. Going exponential just about now after taking another 70 years of abuse and humiliation and plenty of own-goals.I suppose that Griller Normie is ripe for forging a New People.. but to get to the exponential trigger point I posit that requires reaching a threshold amount of area under the suffering/humiliations vs. time curve.

        One look at Rufo’s physiognomy tells you all you need to know. His face is like millions of other contemporary American males. He’s the guy at work who constantly talks about his black friends and how he’s meeting his “black friend, Brian,” to watch the World Series Sunday night.
Anyway, watching them all do backflips in support of a massacre of Palestinians on behalf of a country and a people that despises them — and has pushed these ideologies into our country — brings me great mirth. They understand *nothing* and will fail. The only way out is through rubble.

            That was such an on point description of Rufo, nothing else needs to be said. He’s the typical white guy who marries an Asian woman. Everyone knows these guys, they’re nice enough people and make good neighbors. But I’m not having a conversation with them about anything deeper than the conditions of our lawns.

                Yes. Except that Rufo won’t know the condition of his lawn beyond green or brown – he’s outsourced that job to Miguel.
He is the consummate beta. He is that guy with no confidence who was chosen by the woman who gets the status she wanted by marrying white. He is just happy that he was chosen so he didn’t have to try his hand at doing what the alpha does – choosing his mate from the best available and claiming her. I’ve seen this pattern over and over and over.

        The wife and I have been going back and forth regarding the “magic dirt” theory of rightism. She still clings to the axiom that race doesn’t matter as long as the person is a good, God fearing, moral, constitution loving “murcan”. I on the other hand, having to deal with vibrancy every day at work try to tell her that the magic negro and South American she envisions doesn’t exist. I assert to her that inside of every tie wearing, latte sipping black lawyer or engineer is a spear wielding, tribal adherent just waiting for an opportunity to get out and “get whitey”. If only we could embrace the Nordic Berserker gene in the same way. The battle between the sexes continues.

            It is a topic worth a long post. Maybe I will do one this week or next. The issue, as I see it, is two competing notions of morality. One says you are a good person if you abide by a list of things. The other says you are a good person if you live your life in such a way that it benefits society. Both assume you have a choice in the matter, which is where the problems lie.Through great expense, non-Europeans can be compelled to live as Europeans. Some non-Europeans will require little coercion, while others will require a great deal of it. Both sides assume this is a cost-free project, so they can focus on the former and pretend the latter is due to flaws in their system. By flaws them mean things like education, cultural campaigns and so on.When you have eliminated biological reality then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.

                I have had a similar dialogue with conservatives about the much bemoaned breakdown of the black family in America, purportedly due to the handiwork of government programs of the political left.The inconvenient historical fact is that what we really are witnessing is simply a reversion to the historical mean of black familial relationships. There was a brief period of time, coinciding with Colonial era and through the post-slavery period in America, in which white society pressured blacks to conform to white (i.e., European) standards of behavior, with decidedly mixed success. Prior to this time period, black familial relationships were not monogamous, particularly for men. When, in the 1960s, white society lost confidence in its moral foundation and stopped applying said pressure, black familial relationships simply reverted to the historical mean.We are witnessing the same historical reversion to the mean with white families too, but the mean is dramatically different than black families.

                    Yeah, I grind my teeth when conservatives say that the problem with blacks is the lack of strong fathers.That’s true as far as it goes, but look at Africa, their natural home.  Do you see strong black fathers there?  No.  You see fatherless matriarchal households, because the desire to form a nuclear family is not in their instincts or beliefs.To force blacks to maintain nuclear families requires the kind of enforcement that the South had before the civil rights laws, which takes a huge amount of money, imprisonment, and skull cracking.It’s just not worth the effort that it takes to live with these people.

                        An allied “argument,” which is equally maddening, is looking at the rampant pathologies of inner city negro neighborhoods and blaming them on Democrat rule. The dysfunction doesn’t, of course, spring from Democrat policies; it springs from the people who vote for Democrats 95% of the time. Magical political thinking is no more respectable than magic dirt thinking.

                Alas, “coercion,” or compelled assimilation, is no longer a part of AINO’s makeup. Contrariwise, that river now flows in reverse.
Focusing on the most extreme example–and the only one that really matters–America ceased requiring blacks to behave according to white norms in the second half of the 60s. Nowadays, whites are encouraged, if not yet quite compelled, to sink to negro norms. In an absolutely bizarre reversal of fortune, within a span of approximately 50 years, European America was transformed into an African state that is held together by vestigial European technical competence.

            I was having the debate that you describe in my head all the time fifteen years ago when race realism hit me really hard.  I didn’t want to discount the “good” non-whites because fairness to individuals was very important to me.Ten years ago, I had the same debate with my ex-wife.  On one hand, she took to race realism quickly because she had been a high school teacher in Detroit in her early twenties.  On the other hand, like most women, she didn’t want to be seen as mean.For me, the crucial observation was the tribalism of almost all non-whites.  I was a young man when the OJ trial occurred, and was struck by how many “good” blacks rejoiced when OJ was acquitted.  Later, I noticed all the “good” conservative blacks who voted for Obama.  The only explanation for this is that the tribalism of non-whites commands deeper loyalty than the values that they claim to share with you.We could do detailed investigations to identify the “good” non-tribal non-whites but that would be very time and resource intensive.  Is it worth the cost?  And even if we do that, their kids may revert to the racial mean of tribalism.

                “…their kids may revert to the racial mean of tribalism.”Sadly, you may count on that. Just look at the number on how very many children of the black bourgeoisie go feral; they just can’t resist the pull. The worst thing in the world would be for them to act “white”.I had a black friend in college from a highly successful family. He related to me the old saying among blacks of an aspirational character that you don’t need to put a lid on a basket of crabs, because anytime one of them crawls toward the lip of the basket and escape, the other crabs reach up and pull it down into the basket.The values of upward mobility and escape traditionally needed to be carefully inculcated in black children from such backgrounds through “Jack and Jill” social groupings of children of similarly disposed black families, because it was known how very hard it was to maintain that trajectory toward escape.His brother was following that path, his younger sister seemed (last time I knew), to be on a similar course. His older sister, on the other hand, married a Caribbean black, name of Winston, a “monkey chaser” as they were disparagingly called among american blacks, who hung with loose women and drug users. He brought home a little present to her in consequence of his degraded lifestyle, AIDS, of which she died.My friend was quite gregarious, and pretty smart, but he later confided to me that as a child he was raped by a pedophile in a NYC park. To my sense, he never recovered from this horrifying experience. He became gay, although he was liked by black women. He partook of the bane of the Talented Tenth, in that he had been lifted up in life, but without the demand to actually merit this treatment sufficiently to be able to carry it out because the exertion and self-discipline required to carry it off was not instilled. Political Science major, accepted at Penn Law, but washed out in his first year. Things didn’t go well after that blow. He moved back to NYC, but fell into cocaine use, and wound up becoming almost totally deaf. I visited with him at that time, but subsequently fell out of contact. I fear the worst happened.In that one family’s experience much was to be descried.
