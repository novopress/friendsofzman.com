        I’ll be voting Trump this November,and enthusiastically. Trump has only been a disappointment if you actually expected him to “Make America Great Again”, which we all know is impossible, since America hasn’t even really existed constitutionally since 1964, and culturally since some time in the mid-90’s. Trump’s role is to buy time, break the Uniparty system, and force the Left to reveal their true agenda and radicalize Middle America, all of which has worked magnificently, no matter what Trump thought that he was doing. He’s a transition figure between the old ConInc and the new, populist movement to come – and there had to be one. A second Trump term has the potential to goad the Left into outright secession, which would be the best possible outcome.

                No. The AWRs burn their OWN cities to the ground and murder the race traitors. I don’t have the slightest problem with that. I’m guessing Kenosha is filled with race traitors. Burn, baby, burn.

You and I both know that most of these firearms enthusiast LARPers will do exactly what the McCloskeys did and meekly turn their guns over when “The Blue” shows up at their door.

                                They are also doing exactly the correct thing for their situation.Ultimately Trump buys us time to understand more of what is going on, to learn operate in groups and come up with an  alternative to the current system.We don’t have one any more than the establishment does  and a such can’t win.

                                    Bad guys are getting shot in the streets in these riots right now by people they are marauding against.This is as good as you are going to to see for a while.One or two or twenty or a hundred  confiscations some of which are legally justified (wrong as it is felons many not have firearms) under the old system will not provoke a boog even if you want one.Truth is no  one is ready to wage war on authority , not even  ANTIFA /BLM and even that lot only has a half assed victory condition.When you can tell me in an elevator pitch how your guys win a continent sized civil war with ethnic component, you’ll have a win condition.Otherwise where legal get a few extra guns and some ammo off grid  and bury them for later if you lose you main guns.

                Secession – it’s going to happen no matter who wins, it’s about as inevitable as anything in politics can be. The more whites wake up to what’s actually happening here, the greater the chance that it will happen without civil war. More whites have been redpilled in the last three months than in the last ten years.

                    I live outside of a ridiculous lefty city and there’s a crazy single blue hair down the street who moved in recently and promptly put a tacky handmade “I support BLM” sign in her window. I noticed yesterday it’s gone. Antifatards doing the work for us.
Eta: sorry for the bold type. New commenter trying to figure out the system.

                    They better bring a army with them and be preppared to shed blood on a scale not seen since WWII.Understand that such a state needs to be long term via and that means that it has access to energy, growing it’s own food access to water, etc.It also means purging every city and town of 3rd worlders.

                        This is why people are hesitant to pull the trigger. At that point we are Yemen without as many Muslims and there is no recovery point.

            Exactly this. Contrary to most of the opinion here, Trump has been a massive success for exactly the reasons you articulated, and he would have been even more successful if he had not been required to spend his first three years deflecting the Russia scandal. As a bonus, he accomplished a significant part of his America First agenda.If Trump wins in 2020 the will be massive riots in the streets of Blue cities in Blue states. It’s a absolute joy to watch these cities burn, but in addition every time one burns a wave of normies get into boats to cross the river to our side. If some Blue states secede it will cause a flood of people to cross the river.To paraphrase Biden, if you ain’t votin’ for Trump over Biden, you ain’t White.

            Agreed.  Hate or like Trump, I think most here would admit Trump’s one great accomplishment is pulling the mask off of the Left and revealing the corruption of current government/democracy.  The Left of course played right into it—not that Trump even understood or created the dynamic.Not sure I see the downside in another 4 years of this process with a Trump re-election, albeit one can easily describe a better person for the office, one has a harder time arguing that any such person is present in either party.  Continuous riots in major Leftist strongholds does much to focus normie’s attention.  That is worth it’s weight in gold.

        After appealing to all of the constituencies that will never vote for Republicans, they had Jared Taylor come out and give the case for white people.Stop the presses. Jared Taylor? American Renaissance Jared Taylor? Got a speaking spot at the Republican National Convention? Not in this universe!I was so shocked I couldn’t make it to the next paragraph!Obviously, that never happened and will never happen.The diversity crap irritates everyone on this side of the great divide and many on the other side as well, but the sad truth is most GOP voters lap that stuff up.I have been starting to see signs of this changing. I have been able to get positive responses to some blatantly White Nationalist ideas at fairly normie conservative sites this summer. The sight of our cities being burned and looted has really shocked a lot of regular, normal Americans and they’re just not amenable to the bullshit, anymore.

            If blacks vote 90% for Biden and other minority trends hold, then I have to believe many whites will give up stupid minority vote.  My hope is Trump wins and minority voting stays consistent with voting Dem.  Destroying people in the comments will be fun.

                I’ve had quite a few disagreements with GOPe friends about the black vote. They think that’s the winning strategy, to go after their vote. This is a pivotal election to see if that strategy works, although I can see if the Dems lose say, 3 or 4 percent from their usual 90% of the black vote to Trump, the GOPe will look at it as a success and push to improve on that and pander harder to minorities in future elections.

                It’s not about the black percentage of the vote. That will always be 90%.  It’s about appealing to white suburban women who want empathy for blacks, but swing back and forth in elections.  And if you can get lower black turnout, that is a bonus as well.

                    White suburban women are too busy swimming in remote mountain streams while wearing masks! It’s becoming near impossible to have an ounce of respect for the majority of Western white women.
Don’t expect them to think logically about anything, including the upcoming election.

                The fetish for minority R votes is like magic dirt theory. Its power is inversely related to actual real life examples. So to the Repubs the magic jogger ballot is most powerful when used the least.The post-election ant-f@cking that goes on to tablulate the pox “wins” for team R is an election cycle regular cringe-a-thon.Rebubs: “pox, I like you a lot. What do you think the chances of you and me becoming a thing?”Pox: “not good”Repubs: “not good, as in 1 in 100 or not good as in 1 in a million?”Pox: “one in a million”Repubs: “So you are saying there’s a chance!”

                I think it’s been noted by our blog host in the past that the appeal to minorities is perhaps less of an effort to get them to vote Republican than to placate them enough to stay at home and not vote “against” a Republican.

            I see this with my right leaning normie friends as well.What remains to be seen, however, is if that white identity awakening can exist on its own accord long enough to liberate them from the system and become the right to exist as such.As it stands now their burgeoning whiteness is just another fold in the flag of Patriotism.They know that our people forged this nation and sustain it; the burden of which has increased exponentially under the duress of diversity. They take up that burden with little regard for who they actually serve.As their whiteness nears the outer wire of the plantation, requiring IRL action, these truths shapeshift into the blank slate of the propositional “American Experiement”. Their purpose retreats from anything resembling explicit white people to that of saving “America” from the socialists.As they polish the brass on the doomed ship of fools, they revel in Real Americans (doing jobs americans won’t do) hoisting the flag atop the same hills that have been taken and forfeited time and again.Like so many patriot pack mules with goldfish memories they won’t rest until hill 1986 is ours again and the sacred scrolls of 1776 can once again come to life to keep taxes low.And what I hear constantly from them is that we just need more time. Just one more “conservative” judge appointed. Apparently, retaking ground given up decades ago without a shot now requires a few more years of planning and provisioning.

All these fake ass affluent white female liberals need to experience discomfort, inconvenience, humiliation, and most importantlyfear.Only until they experience fear will there be even a remote chance of them breaking the decades of programming. It requires a reptile brain level event to alter behavior that quickly. More of this will do nicely…

            Speaking of AmRen and Republicans, many of these sell-outs, including Trump, are advocating for the return of the NFL — a league whose Commissioner is now totally on board with BLM and regretful for not listening to Colin Kaepernick earlier.

                The establishment and moderate reformers like President Trump are desperate for social capital of some kind and to try to roll things back a bit.Once a nation realizes that they have nothing whatever in common with the people around them and have no common interests, not even  venial fake Civ Nat stuff like the NFL, that nation has a serious problem.

            Should we be offended by all the diversity crap, though?I think they had some black chick in a red dress running repub right smack dab in Lagos, didn’t they? From her commercial she talked a good talk, and one you seldom hear from black people.The only other negro that I have heard talk to blacks that way was Bill Cosby. Call me a conspiracy nut – but I think that is why he got ‘Me Too’ed…I think the Yesterday Men like myself like to see blacks saying what white people cannot – at least in public. Say what you want, the race card plays well for Leftie and anyone that opposes him must be mindful of it.Hmmm… just war gaming it – but I wouldn’t be surprised if that black sherriff doesn’t get cancelled shortly too. Last I saw of him, he was on a meme telling blacks to clean up their ghettos before cleaning up the police.The Trump team seems to be trying to incite a rebellion on Leftie’s plantation… and I am not necessarily seeing that as a bad thing.

                I heard nothing from her that castigated blacks for the violent squalor in which they choose to live.  Instead it was boilerplate “the Dems have run this town for decades and look what it’s become!”
The only reason she’s got any traction is because of the tight-fitting dresses.  If she looked like Stacey Abrams, she’d never get near the convention.

First, there are very few marriages. Leaving that aside, when blacks think of the a police presence, they think of all their relatives and friends that will probably go to jail and their resentment of non-black power. “Vote for Trump” my ass.
Finally, all this is happening while Trump is President!

            Yeah. I think there might be an argument that suppressing black turnout can be useful – the Dems spend a lot on dragging that bunch to the polls and their turnout is variable enough, maybe, to make it worthwhile. And also, of course, the fact that Normie really, really like the flattery/validation from the Numinous Ones.
People don’t think it be like it is, but it do.

            Sorry. My disease has always been creeping optimism. I’ve got a dinner and bottle(s) of wine bet that Trump’s black vote will crack 10%. Zman said he guesses it’ll be about 12%, so I’m on solid ground. My guess?Over 15%, suckers, and possibly 20%(please, don’t scramble for bets).

                Trump winning 15% is doable and I would agree 10% is likely.  The low water mark for the Dems is 83% of the black vote.  That has happened three times from 1976 onward.  I doubt he’ll hit 20%.  That would be pretty significant if he did.

        I can personally vouch for eyes misting up over the “conservative jogger” talking up family values, hard work, Trump  blah, blah.  An acquaintance is sending $$ to several GOP black candidates around the country.  I tried to tell him, despite the rhetoric, they’ll always be black first and anything else 2nd, 3rd or 4th etc., at worst and pigeon-holed as an Uncle Tom explicitly by the leftards and implicitly by the GOPe dweebs despite the slobbering, at best.  They are no use to us in any way.

                            Wild Goose, I’m just trying to remind people of the reality of NAXALT. Otherwise we risk falling into the trap that Zman has repeatedly warned against, i.e. “defining yourself” in relation to those you oppose or hate. The true DR “hates” no groupin toto; it is harmful and makes no sense. And every reader on this site knows the reality of NAXALT, including NABALT, NAJALT, NAHALT, and even NAWFALT (no matter how rare some of them may be).

                            I’ll pick the White Bubba over the non-White neurosurgeon, because that’s what community means. That Bubba is the guy who needs higher IQ White guys watching his back and protecting him from outgroup grifters taking advantage of him, and you need his muscle and reckless courage when the time for war comes.

                                            If you’ve had that many different races and ethnicities as options to rely on, you’ve grown up in a multi-cultural society and don’t really psychologically comprehend what a homogenous society is like. If you were Chinese, Japanese or Icelandic, or if you had even grown up rural White, you’d have a better idea.I don’t know how old you are, but I grew up in old, White America. That place is mostly gone — it still exists demographically in rural areas, but rural areas get fed the same degenerate entertainment, news media and public education the diverse cities do.Assuming you are White, how many black guys do you have in your life right now that you could rely on if you suddenly found yourself in the middle of a BLM protest?

Hey there! It’s me your good buddy and definitely also white person Anderson Cooper! What do you do for fun?  I like to perform fellatio and help unperson dissenters. I hear you’re on my side so I was thinking we could totally hang out sometime! I was going to invite Chris Cuomo and Stephen Colbert over too.

                                        First White people have to take their own side, then we can deal with our own internal miscreants. Anderson Cooper and his crew are only powerful because of the Black, Hispanic and Asian votes married to the dysfunctional White left  vote, and funded by Jewish millionaires and billionaires.
Whites are the only group that refuses to take their own side.

we’ve got pretty blondes kissing joggers jogging shoes and meanwhile you just got downvoted for saying you’d take a black neurosurgeon over a white methhead.
Can we not go all out acting like whatever kind of over the top nazi archetype Johnathan Greenblatt’s wife probably sexually fantasizes about?
Actual hitler – Hitler, courteously  congratulated Jesse Owens on his olympic medals.  Are we trying to be more literally hitler than literally hitler, literal hitler?

                                Diversity + Proximity = Conflict.Diversity doesn’t work. I wish people of other races all the best in their own nations. Homogenous societies are happier. In a 95% homogenous society, you can have a little spice — some Indian doctors, some Black athletes, whatever, but we don’t have that luxury in the US, we’re way past that and I’m acting hard core because the Happy Rainbow Country lie is one of the big societal lies holding us back and destroying the nation. Civic Nationalism: “Oh, yeah, she’s an Ethiopian immigrant on the outside, but a TrueBlue American in her bones!” doesn’t work. That and the inability for Whites to take their own side in a fight are huge problems. A nation is a people. Immigrants are not our people. Blacks are not our people — we’ve been trying to integrate them for 150 years and there is a big bunch of them running around today yelling about “systemic racism” despite nearly 60 years of preferential treatment. It’s not working.Our dysfunctional White left is largely a product of turn-of-the-century immigration as well. We imported the Marxists that corrupted academia and the ethnic political machines that took over the Democratic Party, but even so, if they didn’t have the Black, Hispanic and Asian voting blocks, they’d be an eternal minority.Taking Bubba’s side doesn’t mean you want him doing brain surgery on you — we have plenty of smart White people for that who *also* shouldn’t have to compete with outgroups for those jobs. It means that in a national community, you look out for everyone in the community. About half of Whites have an IQ below 100. They’re our countrymen, too. Throwing them under the bus to be outcompeted by 110 IQ Asian immigrants, Mexicans who’ll work for $5/hour and live six to a bedroom, and offshore factories and call centers is how you commit national suicide.

                        Well, as much as I like Ben, hard to imagine any goober or bubba doing differently.  It’s not like goober or bubba like section 8 housing next door to them.  In fact, they’d probably be more attune to these diversity ploys than more affluent Whites.  Remember, those AWL’s are the main reason we are in these dangerous times.  They make up the bulk of race traitors in our midst.  I’ve rarely been in the company of a diversity promoting bubba.

            Almost as bad as trusting a gay or transgender. Glenn Reynolds was trying to whip up support for some transgender Republican running out in California and wasn’t really thrilled when I hit back pretty hard that someone who is mistaken about whether he is a man or a woman is too mentally damaged to hold public office no matter what party he’s running under. His very existence is a slap in the face to all those supposed traditional values conservatives never conserve.

                        DR3 is still a useful tactic to use against Democrats. Just b/c something exasperates us doesn’t mean it’s devoid of rhetorical value under the right circumstances. We need flexibility in these things.Ex: Economic nationalism exerts appeal on Bernie supporters. DR3 is useful in undermining the moral position the Democratic party holds for them, giving them an excuse to wander off the reservation. You don’t have to convince them of everything at once.

                            You undermine the Republicrat party politicians by rejecting the entire concept of ‘White racism’ or the belief that preferring one’s own is inherently bad.  There is zero rhetorical value in reaffirming the ruling uniparty’s frame.

                I remember him doing that and getting hammered in the comments.  Someone tried the “anyone who votes with us” line and was similarly destroyed.
We had a black SoS who ran for governor in 2006.  By all accounts, he did a good job as SoS.  He ended up losing his bid.  But, what made me decide to completely give up on blacks for elected office was him praising Obama because first black president.

        One thing working for our side is that the existing system is looking more and more alien to more and more Whites.Those misty-eyed Whites get an emotional chub from non-Whites parroting slogans about freedom and democracy (Republican Whites) or racial justice (Progressive Whites) because they can’t conceive of Whites not being in charge or, at least, being treated fairly in some multi-culti paradise.But more and more Normie Whites are noticing something wrong with that picture, that maybe, just maybe, these people aren’t on our side. To keep Normie White inside the system, Normie White needs to believe that it’s better for them inside than out. That equation is slowly moving to our side.I become every more hopeful for future. The Dems and GOP offer nothing to the vast majority of Whites. Indeed, they offer servitude. I truly believe that our ability to recruit new people and slowly build something outside the current system will naturally grow over time.

            It is important to remember that, in the long run, it is probably better for the DR to be kept away from the political reservation, where movements to make things better get absorbed by the Borg to strangle and die.  The R party holds only a less toxic series of positions than the D party holds, but in no way “gets” or accepts our way of seeing things.  Until someone seeking or in power actually gets it, we are stronger from being kept at a distance from TPTB.  I can think of no better way for us to lose what we stand for, than to have politicians that don’t share our thing beginning to pander to us.

            Yes. It’s becoming even more apparent just in every day life, too. It’s picked up significantly in the past 2-3 years.As far as I can tell, the non-whites are increasingly completely alienated with our people in the Toronto Area. They don’t dress the same, they don’t talk the same, they don’t act the same. These are not immigrants, these are Canadian-born people aping what they see as African-American culture.I notice an increase in white men acting like wiggers, like all the non-white dregs. But there are also alot who don’t.. you’d have to be an idiot not to notice these divisions (and that the non whites clearly hate us). Whites are still in the denial stage. Question is… will they ever do anything about it?

        The rich people sponsoring Kirk and his operation are like the people who back boy bands.

Ah, people like Lou Perlman:


Louis Jay Pearlman(June 19, 1954 – August 19, 2016) was anAmericanrecord producer. He was the creator of successful 1990sboy bandssuch asBackstreet BoysandNSYNC. In 2006, he was accused of running one of the largest and longest-runningPonzi schemesin history, leaving more than $300 million in debts. After being apprehended, he pleaded guilty toconspiracy,money laundering, andmaking false statementsduring abankruptcyproceeding.

What else do we notice here?

            Quite true.  Assuming there are a grand total of two options as to who will run the political show from 1/2021 – 1/2025, regardless of what Trump did/didn’t do, or will/won’t do – the bottom line is it’s a far sight better than the alternative.

I watched about five seconds of that. As she sashays across the stage she looks like a bad B movie actress playing the role of a celebrity, which is probably pretty close to the truth.

                                true, but she’s got more curves than the average bony model. of course, a lot of it unnatural, and to be fair bordering on the pornographic the other night. she even grabbed her right tit at one point and the last words in her speech were “the best is yet tocome!”, emphasis on last word, arms up in air. (((big porn))) is probably licking its chops, finally a sequel to their Palin parodies. in the end Don Jr inherits Dad’s vices, if the only apparent one.

                    Actually… I’m with Karl. She struck me as a once-pretty gal, playing the part of the political dancing monkey on a stage. Too much make up, perhaps. Too much over-acting… but she threw shit at the Democrats well enough.I think that’s why she was up there, maybe? Trump needed some distance from the shit throwers, who would be savaged in the media for doing so.

                        Let’s not be too tough on Jr., Viz. Word was that Vanessa didn’t like being in the spotlight or public political life that muchat all(Jr. takes after his father and does). Imagine what being that close to the President and his family over the past 4 years would be like for someone who doesn’t like that kind of life? Besides,they all appear to be doing okay and getting along in the wake of the divorce.

                            Furthermore, how about this as an alternative read: Don Jr. is dating Guilfoyle because she’s not a young chippy challenge to Vanessa, and she’s not going to have any more kids to interfere with Don &amp; Vanessa’s family. Maybe Jr. and Guilfoyle are just enjoying each other’s company for the time being, and it’s all good with Vanessa too.

            Election 2020 is a demolition derby.  We’re seeing a lot of retreads on old beater jalopies. Hey Joe, Willie pumped Kamala ages ago.  Now she’s a bitter Alpha widow.  Don’t laugh, Trump, Gavin pumped Kimberly when she was hotter, younger and tighter.  Your son and Fox are getting the scraps.  Zman is right.  It’s time for Dissidents to GTOW and simply disengage from the shitshow.

        Kimberly Guilfoyle does what Latinas do best, spend their man’s money.  She’s an apex Latina gold digger.  One of her ex gold mines was Gavin Newsom, who cheated on her.  I don’t hold that against him.  I’m sure she did blow with him on occasion.  Latinas like that love the blow.  I can see why Newsom fell into her honey trap given his stodgy background, and then quickly got bored with her once the “spicy Latina” schtick wore off.  No, she was just a vapid, selfish black hole of a woman.  While she’s not the ugliest woman in the world, there’s nothing naturally pretty about her and she has big time cankles.   She’s pure materialism with zero ethics, so of course when a Trump came along, I’m sure she aggressively pursued the easiest mark of her life.

If there’s anyone on our side taking lessons from the left and flying under the rader and keeping their mouth shut, they will have the best chance of getting things done. When I think of a  dissident politics that exists outside the current construct as a genuine alternative. I think of the people who look like normies by day, but behind-the-senses there putting a subversive movement togather that will some day be strong enough and tightly intergrated to keep from  being assimilated into the borg collective.

        If you want to see people of the system, join a running club.  They sprint like gazelles in herds of 50 around the yuppie (safe and white) parts of certain cities.  Systems people can’t even jog alone with their thoughts.  They need other people of the system around them.

            There’s a lot of truth to this. I used to be part of a couple larger running clubs while living in “elite” metros. Despite the great training and race teams that these clubs provided, they were exactly as you’ve described in addition to constant “networking”.
I quit them all and trained mostly solo but at times with a couple of my peers who were gritty and liked to live more dangerously.

        This again brings to mind my idea of a religious cult of luddite latin speaking Amish like splinter communities. It isnt too late.I think the biggest thing holding back the development of dissent, besides what you outlined above, is that the dissenters are completely unmoored from anything transcendant.The alt right turned out to be larpers and imo left wingers. They had the mockery down but they lost that energy too.The neoreactionary movement had a shakey start but eventually developed some great intellectual ideas that became staples even a mouthbreather could understand, for better or worse. But their materialism and reductionism ultimately offer nothing of substance, just the promise that you get to feel smart while the world burns.For instance, a person in that scene the other day posted a long twitter thread about how our new woke religion is the same as Christianity in that both were just inevitable results of historical forces.Theres some truth to this, but the message in that community in that thread and elsewhere is that all people are just driftwood being tossed back and forth on the waves of history. There is no taking control of your destiny, no will to power, no aspiring to rise above the emptiness of modernity. If we survive and build something greater, just like in the past, it will be the accidental byproduct of uncontrollable and barely knowable historical forces – forces only understood and explained to us by the nrx intellectuals of course. They say perhaps some day we will have the illusion of a spiritual rebirth in our people, a rebirth that will save us for a while, but it will only be an illusion, rrally just one of those forces that drives the arrow of history in one direction or another. How inspiring.Imo the great intellectual developments in these movements are being undercut by their skeptical and atheistic roots.Maybe these movements are necessary stepping stones, giving us bits and pieces of what we need to start building something better, but I suspect we wont make progress until we realize they arent offering us as much as we hoped they were. Or maybe that after we begin to make progress we will then realize they werent offering us as much as we hoped. Either way.

                It wasn’t until fairly recently in history country living didn’t suck and frankly the people weren’t much better than city folk. Worse in some ways. Maybe it’s because I’m old, but I’m not convinced a lot of us could survive that life without broadband internet and smartphones.

                I’ve lived in both some of the largest and most isolated metros in the United States. I could never envision moving back to an urban area let alone a large alpha city. Even suburban areas are too much for me. I used to enjoy exploring coffee shops and libraries while traveling through new areas, but that’s a habit that I no longer have an interest in as so many of the aforementioned places have become overrun by Cultural Marxists and virtue signaling — especially for LGBT and related causes.No, I’ll stay deep in the wilderness where life is quiet and I can be among nature. The benefits outweigh the sacrifices IMO. My life today is so vastly different than it was 10 years ago that I hardly recognize my old self.

        I don’t live in the U.S., so the attention I pay to the conventions is minimal, although they are covered here in France. What struck me about the speakers at the Republican Convention was how many Trump family members were slated to speak.  I think a second Trump term will feature Don Sr. promoting the political ambitions of his family members, especially Ivanka.  Yet one more reason to sit this one out.

A hundred fags will show up at a local city council meeting to try to get an EMT fired for spicy podcasts, but we can’t be bothered to even vote for president unless it flatters us personally and produces certain and complete victory.

DR3 aside that ad is a fine piece of practical politicking. Maryland will go blue no matter what, but if the Republicans find a Kim Klacik for Milwaukee, Detroit, or Philly it could be decisive in that state.

        It is about contradicting the underlying reality of the system, by constructing an independent reality. Dissident politics must exist outside the current construct as a genuine alternative.True. To become an alternative, though, it must first be demonstrated the system is illegitimate and is harmful to our people.I loathe the Republican Party. The multiculti minstrel show, unfortunately, probably is a necessity for it to “win.” By those standards, it was a successful night albeit vomit-inducing.Nonetheless, I do plan to vote for Trump. It’s not because I think he will do anything substantive to reverse course or that the system even is legitimate at this point (it plainly isn’t). No, I plan to vote for him and hope he garners the most votes because the State (again) will not recognize his win if it happens. This will further delegitimize the State. That process began when cucks were forced to acknowledge the FBI and other domestic intelligence agencies have transformed the nation into a grubby police state. It was a bitter pill for them to swallow. They have started to acknowledge the military is just as bad.Trump has demonstrated the limits the State will allow, or to be more precise, what it will not tolerate. He’s probably as close to a third party as will be allowed in the ossified nightmare that is the present day federal system, and that is with all the baggage the GOP, and he, bring with them. We got a taste of it with Perot. Many things he said way back then seemed insane, but given what we know now they probably were true.This election will be gummed up in the courts as long as possible. If Trump has the most electoral votes, his re-election will not be acknowledged and will be thwarted to the fullest extent possible. It will be ugly but necessary to bring more people to our side and away from a State hellbent on their oppression.

        Republicans are like Eichmann, choosing cliche in their last moments, utterly incapable of abstracting away from the pageantry and convention that they identifywithpolitics,aspolitics.And there’s something profoundly tragic about that.  Republicans put up the red, white, and blue doilies, they cheer and applaud, all for something that’s already passed them by.  It’s like an old woman getting dressed up to go on a date with her husband, who has been dead for years.

                    I can respect that opinion while having arrived at a different one.
In short, Biden would probably act as another Obama, with some hard Left elements.  If Trump wins, we’re just getting straight Jacobinism come 2024.

                That’s what I think. The worst case scenario is it goes full-on hot while we have numbers. The best case scenario is a Trump re-election prompts wannabe City-States to secede, which would be the ultimate win-win.

            I’ll take credit for pointing out years ago that Spencer would be David Duke 2.0. People forget that Duke for a while in the 1990’s, would happily go on left-wing platforms and perform the role they had for him. Then they got bored with him. That’s Spencer. The difference is Duke was smarter. Spencer goes off script, because he is basically a male bimbo.It will be interesting to see if the people suing Spencer are able to attach his trust. He is in default in one case in Ohio, I think. He blew off another case in Indiana, I think. He’s being sued in Virginia. I would assume his trust is safe, which is why he was told to blow off these cases. They can get nothing from him, so why fight?That could also be why he is back living with mom. That may be a state with strong laws protecting the distribution of a trust or the trustee is establishing that he has the sole discretion on distributions.

                    Yeah, I just saw that. Paul and I are roughly the same age, so we remember when they turned Duke into a carnival act. I know a lot of older guys warned the alt-right about this. I won’t name any names, but it is not hard to guess.

            Why did Richard Spencer post a pic of himself and his girlfriend in front of a giant LBGT…err whatever flag?  Why did he tweet that Hillary would’ve done a better job handling the Covid crisis than Trump?  I could go on and on with contrarian takes.  Spencer loves attention and despises giving opinions that he considers basic and predictable.  He wants to be the guy that says something novel and makes everyone gasp.

        Kimberly Guilfoyle probably appeals to the go-getter Hispanics who boast about being Republicans. I live in SoCal, and there’s a lot of these guys and gals, usually in sales or start-up business. They do an excellent job at that level and know the power of follow-thru and building trust. (Someday maybe we’ll see blacks doing this). As for her boyfriend Trump Jr. I haven’t observed either of those two sons much. But Jr. seems to do interviews a lot better than Eric. Eric tries to do the brash loudmouth thing, but it’s forced and repetitive. He sucks and is annoying.

            Yes, we have a lot of them here, and they are as you described.  They have a knack for sales for sure.  A lot of them come from very impoverished backgrounds, like the Central Valley, and they have this what I describe as a “Scarlett O’hara moment”. where they put their fist in the air and say, “whatever it takes, I’ll never go hungry again.”  They value everyone and everything on the material level.  They don’t like pobres.  They don’t like being reminded of that.  The good thing is they pretty much hate the homeless and hate it when born into it white people help them.  Ordinarily I don’t hate this attitude, but I hope their kids end up with more depth to their character.

        Just going through the Rope Center exit polling for presidential elections since 1975.Worst Democrat results by minority group:Black – 83% (76,80,92)Hispanic – 53% (04)Asian – 33% (92) – earliest coverage is 1992Best Democrat results by minority group:Black – 95% (08)Hispanic – 82% (76)Asian – 73% (12) – earliest coverage is 1992Republicans won the Asian vote twice, 92 and 96, but otherwise it has gone heavily Democrat. Blacks always fall in the low 80’s to low 90’s. Hispanics tend to be mid-60’s to low 70’s with a couple of low 50 outliers. Even if Trump gets blacks into the low 80’s, it is nothing exceptional.OT: Search engines for stuff like this are junk anymore.  They flood you with repetitive current articles.

            If Trump gets over 15% of the black vote – and that’s a Big If -he should win at least 35 states: basically everything between the northeast and the Pacific except Illinois and New Mexico.  Virginia might even be in play under this scenario.  This assumes no big switch in the suburbs or increase in the under 25 vote, and everything else remaining at 2016 levels.If Trumps gets over 15% of the black vote – a doubling of what he got in 2016 – it will be a massive repudiation of the DNC-Clinton-Obama approach to electoral politics.  This is why such a shattering result will not be accepted, as Clinton is already signaling.  The globalists cannot allow both political parties to be slip out of their control.If Trump does nothing more than wedge the prog and Marxist left away from the neoliberal left he will have achieved something truly historic.But one scenario I wonder about is the GOP increasing their share of both the black and brown latino vote but losing massively with hysterical suburban women.I would like to see a breakdown between east Asians and south Asians.  The GOP has been aggressively courting Indians for almost twenty years, both domestically and internationally.Harris may have been put on the ticket to appeal to Bay area tech drones, but Haley and especially Jindal are out there to appeal to your local discount beverage and roach motel owners. Given their patrons, these people are far more realistic about race (and class) than suburban whites.  Do the Apus out there actually see Harris as one of their own?  The “Grandparents cry” meme may closer to the mark there.

        Once the light bulb comes on in our heads existing outside the current political system becomes the clearest path forward.This not only applies to our political life it applies to many of us out here in our metaphysical life.The two party mainstream Christianity of Catholics and Protestants has undergone the same transformation into a phony way forward as our political parties have.We get Pope Francis and his South American style communism or Jerry Falwell Jr and his pool boys.True Christianity is left outside the electric fence.We need to build new answers all throughout our civilization, both political and spiritual.

        The liberal brother tells me Conway as been pressured out.

He believes charges will be brought after the election.  I think he’s right, and that charges will be brought against all the former Trump regime.

It will be a permanent feature.
The Revolution has already been won, comrades!

            This should be a wake-up call. This shit is coming for you. It was fun to watch when “only the big cities are affected” but every town is affected now. Kenosha, for example, is only 10% black. Didn’t stop it from being torched.

        Z Man said: “Dissident politics must exist outside the current construct as a genuine alternative.”So you want to construct an alternative status system. Well, ok. People have tried pioneering, hippie communes, Socialist and Anarchist collectives, the Golden Horde, art colonies, the mafia, biker gangs, the Aryan Brotherhood and hobo camps. Not to mention religous cults. There’s all kinds of people in the world. And White “Dissidents” come in 31 flavors. Maybe it would be helpful if you write a manifesto, describing in detail what your conception of dissident politics actually looks like. As you see it, what are the main organizing principles of a ” genuine alternative” existing outside the current construct?

            I told you. We’re an anarcho-syndicalist commune. We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week. But all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting. By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs,but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more– well, you get the picture.

But how about this as an alternative to total outsiderism: An active faction within the new economically nationalist GOP (courtesy of Trump) consisting of non-aggressive white ethno-nationalists? Hmmm? After all, the Democrat party has a large, aggressive (read “hate-filled“),POCethno-nationalist factionthat’s threatening to take over completely.

I just hear a lot of good ideas on this site that I agree with but that never, in the end, seem TO ME to jell into a coherent and positive plan of action. Is that just me?Jim Smith said: “…the Democrat party has a large, aggressive (read “hate-filled“),POCethno-nationalist factionthat’s threatening to take over completely.”Your talking about bioleninism. Gathering a coalition of the biological out groups, and promising them a rise in status and wealth. Resentment is a powerful motivator. And the left never stops pounding that drum. What is our side going to use to rally the troops?

            So far as I uderstand it the DR is what you make of it Since there is no core set of beliefs, values or anything else.  The people pushing it are oddly adverse to putting anything down in writing.
Because of this I really don’t see it going anywhere. I suspect it will get assimilated by some other movement that is more serious and energetic that the current lot of DR thought leaders.

You could be right. Only time will tell.

                Yes, and the taxonomy of the DR has been broken down in great detail on both Amerika and Western Rifle Shooters Association, which WordPress deplatformed a couple of months ago. Nonetheless, this is worth the read:

                Yes, there’s no doubt that the combination of Cville and Trump’s election scared the Left badly, they are still hysterical about it. As ineffectual as Trump and Cville might have looked from our side, these things really hit a nerve with our enemies. If you want to know where their weak points are, look at what they fear.

            I think initially they were scary, but that’s why the elevated the goofball to positions of prominence. The Left is good at picking the leaders of their opposition. Greg Johnson often talks about an exchange he had with one of the TWP people. That person, I forget which one it was now, flat out told him that he courted left-wing media attention, because that would elevate him the eyes of their movement.

        it depends zman. what if the strapon collar (lol) comes for everyone anyway, as the people inside the circle can’t afford more electricity? (as seen in California). better keep the funny costumes in the closet, just in case. in the meantime yeah, crack jokes, remain normal, yet also avoid degeneracy. mock it, yet also pray for those under its spell.also, one of the few valid marks left by the sin/error of slaving the negros instead of picking our own damn cotton, is that whites tend to love being validated when a black or brown supports them politically, forgetting enough times when to draw the line and not bend over. two slaps in the face are fine, not endless knockout games. dems take it a step further into atheist miscegenation and de-whitefication; but reps love their freetrade and Prot universalism, and ergo their peon browns and refugees.that said, even if a nation had to be multiracial for geographical/ethnohistoric reasons, and a racial hierarchy developed: the best course of action is more about allowing segregation and self-rule, with enough coordination and order, within the classes and groups; rather than only thinking about subjugation. us the castizos should know, our browns resented us earlier than yours; though then again we did need bigger numbers, and less secularists and/or race traitors…

        I am on the phone all day at work. Most of the prospects are small business owners. No one ever advocates Trump. But lefties are proudly and vociferously anti-Trump.Personally, I don’t give a rip about Trump. His most passionate position was to build a wall. He couldn’t build a picket fence.i haven’t watched a second of either convention. I would rather spend my time thinking of ways to wake White people up to the sea of self-hatred they bath in, courtesy of the elites and non-whites.we are living in the matrix. Very few of us know it. There must be a way to wake up other white people.i love history. We fought the wrong civil war 170 years ago. To get rid of slavery, we should have gotten rid of the slaves. Instead, we helped them migrate to new continents they would never have found on their own. In 1700, their were more Europeans than Africans. Then Europeans brought civilization Africans weren’t ready for. The result is our self-destruction.Now Africans out-number Europeans 2-1. And Africans are doing their best to turn the Western Hemisphere into a new third world.Instead of Europeans and their colonies and offspring destroying themselves in two world Wars, they should have found a way to rule the world.We need to wake up.
