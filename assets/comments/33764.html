        Sigh.  Demographics is destiny.  Way back in 2018 (i.e. before Biden’s handlers ushered in 5-9 million legal and illegal aliens), 50% of the US population was age 37 or younger.  Millenials, GenZ, etc.  And back then, the average age of US Whites was 58.  Of that young 50% of AINO, only 43% was White.  Now add 8 years of non-White births and immigration (of any kind) and 8 years of White deaths.The face of the ‘left’ to oldsters here is Pelosi or Schumer.  But look at city councils and state legislative bodies.  Look at who’s running for school boards.  It’s all Yang and Munoz and Chopra.  The ‘left’ wasn’t and isn’t just anti-White people, it’s anti-Western Civilization.  Which is slowly being subsumed by the 90% non-White world.  We fed and immunized our own dispossession, and continue to do so.  The great causes of cuckservatives (anti-abortion and color-blindness) have only served to accelerate the decline.The rest of this – including the mischaracterization of Christianity – is a cope.  Sure,  the blacks and browns don’t want to be predated on by criminals.  That’s why their home countries are such havens of law and order . . . oh, wait.  They want to BE the predators.  They want your houses, your universities, your institutions, and your money.  They want to see their faces in movies, on tv, in ads.  They want to hear their own language and have their history and culture celebrated in the schools. And they want to impregnate your daughters – which is what conquering people have done for millennia – and perhaps whiten up their skin tone a bit, or have the rare case of blue or green eyes appear.  The Ottoman empire did this for generations.  Newsflash:  Aside from the upper class, Turks still look Turkish, not European Caucasian.I repeat, demographics is destiny.  But go ahead and celebrate the ‘triumph’ of supposed ‘right’ politics and ideology.

            That’s more true.“The left,” the white people who run it, doesn’t resent anything. It’s triumphalist—narcissistically so, so any contradiction to it comes as a near-fatal shock, a wound to be trebly avenged, not a lesson to be incorporated in its plans (which have now achievedautopilot). That’s why it became censoriousdecades ago.Non-whites in the West are hateful, not resentful. They consider whites losers because we’ve been defeated. Check the spreadsheet:Loser pays.The universal politics of America, “left” and “right,” isn’t grounded in envy but in sadism. The already beaten must be beaten to death. The loser must loseon television, forever in syndication. Etc.Nietzschean “ressentiment” is a reversal of hierarchy. Conservatives are prone to imagine those where they’re not happening: management driven to wokeness by crazy young employees, etc. Such a violation of nature would be superficial and temporary. The truth will out, sane men will grasp the flailing reins, the horde will vanish back into the cubicle maze, etc. This will happen on its own, in time—or right now with just a littlebumpof rhetoric or logic or money.Would Nietzsche agree?“Who cares? He was a loser.”

            True, but the alternative is to say little and have more “pity parties”.  Makes for poor comment sections.  Let’s ignore the “elephant” and delve into “what if” discussions.  As long as we don’t assume that which is not in evidence.

            3g, as a non-believing fan of historic Christianity, I’m curious what is a “mischaracterization of Christianity?” Is this mischaracterization in our host’s post today? Or is it the belief that the blacks and hispanics can be turned into white people by Christianity?
The “it’s all so tiresome” tone of your post reminds me of two great poems, written by Christians.
Kipling in “Gods”:And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more
Eliot from “Burnt Norton” in “Four Quartets”:human kind cannot bear very much reality

                Line – I don’t want to go into too much theology and hijack the thread.  I am a baptized and believing Christian, and obviously much depends on which verses one chooses to focus on, but the Bible I read says a godly man takes care of his own family first.  He helps others, but with his own money and not the public purse – and not at the expense of his family or people.  Many ‘nations’ may share the faith, but ‘brothers’ in faith does not automatically equate to ‘brothers’ in blood.God created the different races.  He scattered those who built the Tower of Babel.  And there are different and distinct ‘nations’ in heaven.  Sharing faith doesn’t have to mean sharing territory and daughters.I love Kipling, and you definitely pinpointed my “tiresome” tone.  I seem to endlessly repeat demographic reality (even accounting for official ‘fudging’ of the numbers) both to the civnats who think every non-White is a potential ‘good one’ via upbringing and economics, and to the supposed race-realist ‘right’ that both rejects much ideology and yet believes politics and ideology will prevail over genetic nature and sheer numbers (quantity having a quality all its own, etc.).So I am not sanguine about the future – near or long term.  I actually lead a fairly happy life.  I have a wonderful husband and a happy marriage.  I have children and a grandson and some deeply appreciated friends.  I find things to learn and take joy from daily.  But having to re-litigate the same old fallacies and assumptions gets awfully tiresome.  I don’t focus on the coming demographic apocalypse daily; I just live my life and do my best to care for my family.  What will be, will be – long after I am gone.  But history’s demographic lessons seem pretty clear to me.  Many nations and peoples have been lost in history.  Our race and our ‘age’ is not immune, AI and ideology and ‘winning’ regardless.Best to you in your new home among heritage Americans – it may require some economic sacrifices, but they are well worth the resultant peace, safety, and sane lifestyle.  Most women are not to be trusted, but I hope you can find a genuine ‘good one’ and raise a family – to me, there is little point to life without family and children.

                    That is a great, and cogent post. When I come across various and sundry people that might want to discuss, or ‘debate’ the issue of faith, similar to when anxious soy men find out my joy of riding on 2 wheels and ‘share’ that they know someone who knows someone that died…… “well, not everyone is meant to ride.”If in the company of an ‘intellectual’ regarding faith I might use a big word: Praxeology. For me, monogamy, loyalty, frugalness, discernment … etc. etc. Biblical values are a perfect approach to life even if you do not share my Savior.“Hey, buck, how’s it turning out for you?”More often than not I am hearing from the divorced, estranged from their children, or generally unhappy men. The unhappily retired, bored.

            “They want to BE the predators.”
This x10,000. Yes, they love it when white rule of law protects them and their property, but they hate it when white rule of law protects others and the property of othersfrom them. The latter instinct always wins out in the end.

            Perhaps I misunderstand your tone, so correct me if I do. However, a lot of the “demographics are destiny” people say that to mean that all is lost and the endpoint is known because of the demographics. This is just not true. The demographic picture can change for any number of reasons due to unforeseen events and variables. I’ll give examples.At the turn of 20th century, whites were roughly 25% of the world population. People thought whites would take over the world, and the current predicament would have been unfathomable. Specifically, many bemoaned in Europe how the Germans were having an insane amount of kids and that they were destined to demographically beat everyone. How are they now? Now we’re 7% (last I checked, I’m too lazy now to check again). What happened? A few devastating world wars and absolutely plummeting birth rates because of (amongst many things) secularism and materialism. Conversely, African populations were stagnant because they simply couldn’t produce the food necessary for big populations. What happened? Enormous free and cheap food/grain subsidies from European countries allowing a population boom.Our side also recounts (correctly) the reconquista, where Europeans took back the Iberian peninsula over the course of 700 years. Demographics, in these cases, was not destiny.My point is this, there are unknown unknowns. There are potentially economic depressions, major wars, civil wars, current establishments pushing the envelope too far, etc which change the landscape entirely. Projecting current demographics trends into infinity is often shortsighted

        The Left transformed into the Hate White Men (and women, to a degree) Party. It was a decent rallying cry but left them with no real game plan for the country. The Left’s younger politicians – AOC, towel head lady, etc. – were, of course, ridiculous, but even the party establishment had no clue what they wanted to do while in power other than cry about racists and fascists.
Other than policies to hurt whites, what else did the Left want to actually accomplish? I really can’t think of anything.

            The Left’s shrieking about racists, fascists and Nazis will increase as White consciousness and advocacy emerges.  A sign of what’s coming is Tucker and Joe Rogan dipping their toe in the water with questions of why only Whites aren’t allowed a homeland. The Left aren’t going to like what’s coming.

                The Left will become more and more blatantly violent and will turn to terrorism. It’s problem is that will be countered now and like so many bullies, leftists curl into a fetal position and moan when actually challenged. Con, Inc., and censorship were needed to prevent pushback.

                    I predict that blacks are going to increase their desire for separation. On the one hand they are torn because they need the gibs to maintain any semblance of a middle class. On the other hand, the non-whites don’t give two craps about slavery and California is already showing their future. There will be no reparations coming from Latheeeennnnossss, subcontinentals and Hans.Moreover, they have no guilt about slavery and their cultures are not deracinated and demoralized. Cries of racism when Asians get sick and tired of black dysfunction and crime will not just fall on deaf ears, they will raise an ire that comes with regrets for having done so. They may bring the hammer down in a way that Christians never did – despite the lies that Howard Zinn and abolitionists and black race hustlers told them.They wanted us replaced and they got their wish. It is going to be a terrible case of careful what you wish for as Whites go their own way and the Chinese and Indian diasporas fight to control the post-American satrapy. Low IQ and low impulse control made white genocide and ethnic replacement seem like a dream come true. What happens when China or India want to move in to Detroit? Life under Christianized Europeans will seem like a dream.So, they will increasingly be looking to go their own way too.

                        Unfortunately, by the time this is all ”normalized”, we (USA) will be similar to a typical 3rd world country.  Basically the elite, or rich, vs everyone else.  It can be no other way in a multiracial society.  We may indeed leave the Blacks and Hispanics behind, only to squabble with the Hans and Subcontinentals for top place.
Now if you are one of those lucky few, this is perhaps not so bad.  But for the majority of us, it is a future we never grew up in nor raised our children to thrive in.

                            Spot on, and this is the likeliest scenario. Separation is quite possible in the United States, though, and is happening already. The Subcons and Han, unlike all other groups save whites, can establish polities that work, though, and will be prone to make war with white/whiter enclaves.

                            You are correct. I left that part out. I am not one of the lucky few. For us, and by that I mean you and me and the American remnant of the Historic American Nation’s former middle class, it is hard to see things. If the alien elite do not rule as an Asian satrap, but some post-American continental empire it looks as follows to me:I think a major percentage will give up and mongrelize. My guess is about 70%. They will give in to despair and take the temporarily easy path.I think about 30% will refuse to give in and think through several generations ahead. We will create enclaves and either ignore the central authority, or do some deal with them because they need us. In that case that will allow us to keep our redoubts as we desire them. In exchange, they will have a reliable and stable source of military recruits, high-skilled labor using highly technical tools, and a feeder system of competence needed to keep society running even if it runs on bots.In my opinion, our focus and task, if you want to be in that 30% and give your posterity a chance to remain in it, is to plant those trees.Over time, that 30% may grow because I don’t think the techno-optimists future is going to work out the way they think it will. That 30% needs to be very selective when some from the other 70 come knocking.A feature of that life is going to be exercising the will to keep your redoubt yours and yours alone.

                        And what is their own way? That implies a direction. American blacks have a negative identity. Meaning what they fight to push off against is their identity. Not a positive sense of direction and cultural goals.In water treatment, I worked with a man from Nigeria, oddly enough he came from a wealthy family, educated through the Sorbonne, was in the process of developing his own tele-com company, which he accomplished. A very, very super smart man, a wonderful man to work with, endlessly helpful to me and a great sense of humor. No victim here. He really disliked American blacks because he stated they had no positive identity, wallowed in victimization, and said he wouldn’t let his own teenage daughter date American or Caribbean blacks.

                            That is a good point – a very good point. I guess they won’t be choosing much. Perhaps, the most realistic scenario is an endogamic elite that intermarries across the races and forms their own ethno-genesis within class.

                Too bad Tucker’s a radical feminist, albeit not at all acknowledged as such, not even in the slightest.  Yet he is, full stop.  Worse is that he has lots of company.  There are way too many on the “right” who share this trait.  There are certain types on the “right” for whom this really seems a central, core defining feature.Many if not most are very likely not dishonest, not at all.  Rather, it’s absolute lack of both outer awareness and self-awareness within certain areas, a so called blind spot, here a total and serious blind spot.  Tucker would see things more clearly and completely, both the current chaos and dysfunction and how it got like this, as well as what potential corrective actions may actually be effective, versus not.

                    Cucker Tarlson is a feminist. The Brett Kavanaugh of the media.  The usual kind one finds on the Right. They don’t WANT to face the truth about female nature and collective female power.  For various reasons, they are AFRAID.  And should be.
Feminism and its rule over America is the true third rail of politics and culture. Nobody, and I mean nobody, on the Right with a public forum dares to address it, and that tells me who really rules over the land.

                    The internet killed the business model, but it didn’t have to kill the control. They could have saved themselves (somewhat) if they didn’t lie constantly. They were still getting funding from the regime so the old business model didn’t have to be successful. But when you’ve got a regime that wants to replace the people (among other nefarious goals), and the regime owns the media, well, I guess they can’t really tell you the truth about all that, can they?Is it possible that the death of MSM’s independence (as much as it ever had any, debatable, another discussion) was caused by the internet induced failure of the business model, which made it dependent on regime funding, and turning it into a more blatant and brazen regime mouthpiece? (even moreso than it had been one before)

            I’m not a big fan of Steve Sailer but his Coalition of the Fringes framing is dead-on. The modern Left is a circular firing squad aimed at White people. But it only really works when not just every single member of the coalition is aimed at Whites, but Whites aren’t firing back. The problem is, post-2020, both tenets of this started to fall apart. The transgender thing led to an internecine war with hardcore feminists, the progressive stack started to crumble as certain groups (like White gay men) were deemed not marginalized enough, and of course Whites started to question why this arrangement is the way it is and why they should be supporting it.

                    I’d recommend against believing this.The attitudes of the imported replacement professional class—”foreign students”et al.—aren’texactlythe desired ones. But they are very, very close. And replacement itself is the inalterable goal, regardless of secondary effects.How many are being thrown out for “supporting terrorism” or whatever? I’ve seen two names, a Chinese girl (nobody cared) and some Arab (or approximate Arab) that of course the girls of the left and fags of the right are all lubed up for, since his name sounds like it came off a MOST WANTED poster. That’s it. I’d expect some more, but not many more.A sudden, small purge disciplines. It sets the exception—our guys love to talk about that, right?—to the rule of anti-whiteness. After that, what “antisemites” remain to be punished? Just you. And the apparatus is waiting.

                        The apparatus is being dismantled, mostly inadvertently, despite the kabuki aspects of maintaining it to relentlessly hunt anti-Semites. The Jewish Century has come and Died Suddenly despite the best efforts of well-paid Goy Hearsts to keep it alive. Anti-whiteness still will be a thing for the immediate future but its operation manual is in different hands. Those hands do not recognize any distinction at all between Hebrews and Gentiles and if anything will go harder against the former. I very much recommend realizing October 7, but even more so its genocidal aftermath, has changed everything. The goal remains the same but the instruments are in far more incompetent hands.

                    Lots of MAGA people believe that Trump won because normal people finally had enough of the left’s policies. They want to believe that their grumbling was finally too loud to ignore.
I tend to agree with you. Trump got momentum and won because the elites decided not to back the left for the first time because of Oct. 7. Before Oct. 7, the j3ws thought that flooding the West with non-whites was best for them. The non-white response to Oct. 7 caused them to reconsider
Unfortunately, I don’t know of a decisive argument to establish this. It’s all speculation.

                        That’s exactly my take. America is a woman being gangraped for decades. The gangrapists all love money and all hate us.This Trump guy comes along and tells the gangrapists that they need to stop. He squeaks his way into authority, but they reorganize, counterattack and boot him out, but in the confusion of their desperate attempt to keep him from a second term the worst of the gang rapists comes to power, the one who hates America more than they love the money they are raping out of America. We’ll come him ‘Chuckie’.The other rapists are distraught. They can’t keep raping America if she is dead, and while they hate America they love the money more.They have no power to stop Chuckie on a timescale that will save the massive multi-generational investment that their ancestors have made setting up the giant rape-whiteChristians factory that America has become. The two and only political parties, over which they used to have lock-stock grip control, were then and are still in revolt and hence unreliable instruments of their will.The only guy who could stop Chuckie from killing America and perhaps unraveling their entire planetary system of rentseeking grift is this Trump guy who they just booted out. Imagine their desperate exasperation.President Trump has a deal, implicit or explicit I do not know, with these people. They CHOSE not to cheat that time because it was not in their interest. (1) I knew the fix was in (for Trump, this time) when that loathsome creature Lyndsey Graham publicly announced that GA Gov. Kemp’s “machine” (his word, not mine) would be behind Trump. Graham and Kemp both are agents (in the sense of one who acts for another) of the Sea Island Group, one of the corporate cartel members who own and rule America.Devotion to Jewish interests is the central element ofPres. Trump’s side of the deal. He is Israel-first, facilitating the ethnic cleansing operations of Jewish nationalists. He is also rebooting the empire, serving the interests of Jewish internationalists. None of this serves AMERICAN interests, which is why outspoken genuine American patriots like Douglas Macgregor and Daniel Davis are not in his government.Where will this end? Chuckie has lost a lot of support, but the support that remains has hardened considerably, and will probably be engaging in self-organizing after their ‘betrayal’ by the corporate oligarchy. They are not out of the game.It is early days, but the ballot fraud systems have not been dismantled, so it is still within the power of the transnational oligarchy to choose the candidate from whichever of the parties is least hostile to their interests, as long as they can maintain control over them. They want adequate control over at least one party, and given the collapse of the Dems they will probably try hardest to get another Romney-like fink installed as Republican frontrunner. Recent praise for Trump from corporate sleazebag Reince Preibus indicates that their Republican-electorate influence and perception management operations are ongoing.(1) Some of their pet Africans didn’t follow orders. (Recall the Africans filmed unloading boxes of ballots in Pennsylvania from cars with California plates after the polls were closed.) These cheaters have NOT been punished, but their efforts were not enough to derail the will of their masters.

They also discovered that the automatic support they expected from all the 20s and 30s who went on school trips to the Holocaust Museums wasn’t there, that TikTok Palestinians were telling a powerful story, and that “descendant of a holocaust survivor” wasn’t even worth a venti latte at Starbucks.
The shock of this discovery still hasn’t worn off.

                    A very lopsided body count against your enemy isn’t exactly good optics for the Israelis. Regardless of what foreign groups are aiding them, the pro-Palestinian protesters raise difficult points. Regardless of one’s allegiances, it also has the salutary (in my opinion) effect of raising the issue or at least bringing to public view, the questions such as:Why do we tolerate political activism by (e.g.) tenured professors or resident alien students? On the one hand, yes our nation values free speech. But on the other hand, most nations, even democracies, typically impose strict limits on political activism by non-citizens.To what degree should government deport troublemakers? Please don’t get me wrong; I think foreign troublemakers should be shown the door posthaste. If you want to work or study here Mohammed, you are welcome to, but if you screw up in the slightest your ass is on the first flight back to your home country. But it seems like we’re only deporting those who foment protest against Our Greatest Ally. Everybody knows that the US stands firmly behind Israel, but beyond a certain point, the non-aligned will begin to wonder precisely how we can square our putative “equality before the law” when there are so many cases of blatant favoritism or actual hostility to unflavored groups.The most important part of your comment, and I’m in full agreement (while perhaps reading much into it, as is my wont), is that international Jewry (and broadly, the super-rich, Tech Bros, etc.) realized that the Left has gone off the rails and indeed pose a clear and present danger to the established political order. They are on “Team Whitey” not because they have any special love for us. Oh, if only it were so! But the Tribe will always have its tribal loyalties. What survival oriented people does not favor their own kind? But it was slowly dawning on powerful people that Progressivism was eroding the underpinnings of what made the Oligarchs wealthy and powerful. They’re acting out of self-interest, most likely.

            The Leftistressentimentstems from democratizing society to include blacks and women. When blacks and women are not merely given “equal opportunity,” but in fact preferential treatment, and theystillcannot measure up to white men, they become resentful and hateful toward their white male betters and invent conspiracy theories about “institutional racism” and “sexual harassment” and “hostile work environment.”This is particularly evident in colleges and universities — the very places where “racism” and “sexism” are objectively non-existent are the places where you see the most complaints, the most hysteria, and the most hoaxes — like the “Klan” at Oberlin College, LOL.When you hire underqualified or unqualified women as faculty, and allow 85 IQ Negroes into college, their incompetence is on full display when they compete against competent white males. Consequently they act upon theirressentiment.Colleges have became completely debased decades ago as a result, but now the problem is in corporations and the military as well. Can’t hack it in Air Force flight school when all the Top Gun-type white guys can? Must be racism and sexism. You even see it in pro sports — now that childless, tattooed lesbians are free to play professional soccer and basketball, they bitch that nobody cares about the WNBA, or, like the repellent dyke Megan Rapinoe, that they don’t make as much money as men (Honey, I go news for you — you ain’t Pelé, LOL).As far as Jewishressentimentis concerned, it exists because “God’s Chosen” have been outperformed by the Christian goyim for centuries. The Notre Dame and Westminster are not Jewish, you do not drive a Jewish car, fly on a Jewish airplane, live in a Jewish-built house, or use a Jewish computer and Jewish cell phone. Jews did not land on the moon or harness electricity or provide you with clean running water. Israel is an insignificant little scrap of desert compared to Russia, China, Germany, and the U.S.Ressentiment is basically the envy that drives race and gender communism, and it is no wonder that so many communist intellectuals like the Frankfurt Schoolers were Jews. Blacks, women and Jews are lumpenproletarians and they know it, so they are filled with hate and envy for the white male “bourgeoisie” that created the world they live in.

            The problem they face from a national perspective is that they do not believe the 2020 election was stolen, which means that there is no inhibiting factor as, to them, the worst people with the worst ideas can easily win an election (and yes, many clowns on X claiming Harris lost for being too far *right*).

            The Sam Hyde quote was spot on.“When we win, do not forget that these people want you broke, dead, your kids raped and brainwashed, and they think it’s funny”
The left is openly advocating murderers, rapists, Mafiosos, and ultra-violent gang bangers be allowed to stay here because of “due process”.
30 million illegals in the land; due process is a literally impossibility, they know it, and they’re greatly vexed that some on the right have finally figured this out.

        Actually, the one and really only thing democrats/ the left oppose is Trump.  He is their evil incarnate.  Anything he is for, they are against – even if the American electorate is 100% for it.  Further, the only reason the psychos are trashing their beloved Gaia blessed Teslas is because of Musk’s alliance with Trump, period.  As the man said himself, he could cure cancer and the libtards would still hate him.

            Yes. But before that it was poverty. The cause of poverty is wealth and thus the rich. So they hate the rich. They hate oppression. Howard Zinn and other perfidious subversives told them whites and The West were oppressing everyone. So they hate whites and The West. It isn’t just that they must hate these things, they must destroy them in order to destroy oppression. Before that it was success. For one person’s success is the cause of another person’s failure. So the great evil of success and the successful must be destroyed. They hate beauty because if there are the beautiful then there are also the ugly. Thus beauty must be uglified and eradicated. They hate strength because strength doesn’t construct greatness and protect the weak, it smashes and destroys and threatens the weak. So strength must be degraded and gotten rid of. They hate knowledge because knowledge acquired by the wise can elevate them above the ignorant and the foolish. So knowledge and the knowledgable must be eradicated and destroyed.Of course, on the sidelines of all of this are demons, using these tools to destroy so they can feast on the corpulent ruins.If you want to understand the left, there are two faces you should look at.Hakeem Jeffries and Charles Schumer.Just look at those faces and you will see what the left is. I look at them and I see demonic evil.

                    Poverty reduction actually gave the Left a positive image for a period long ago. Bashing innocent whites as devils thereafter gave them a negative image. There is an attempt to return to the old playbook but the dusky psychopaths put into place will not have it. In the States, look for Whites to be thoroughly purged from the Democrat Party, to give one example, wherever that is possible for the Left. And mark my word: the Left will get violent here, possibly very violent, until it gets countered (which will happen now). They do tend to curl into the fetal position and moan when hit back, though.

                        Definitely.  I view all these things is terms of “transition” or phases.  The outcome being quite predictable in hindsight.  The early years of the process saw results in ameliorating poverty by tweaking opportunities for those impoverished.  LBJ’s “Great Society” efforts for example.
However, all these efforts were, in the end, doomed to failure because they lacked a fundamental understanding of the human condition—“we are not all equal”.  In the end, we differ in condition not because of external factors, but because of internal factors.
Reality can not be denied for long.

And this is a very modern thing, this desire to accentuate and celebrate ugliness, a la tats and piercings, head shavings and purple hair.  In the Fifties and Sixties, people strove towards the beautiful.  Now everyone wants to be cool and live on the dark side of the moon.

        Indeed, Prog moralizing was always key for the Left. But this picture is incomplete without looking at the old “class struggle” Left. The Labor vs. Capital issues were just as prominent as the moralizing. Of course, Capital crushed Labor and NAFTA/WTO were the daggers through the heart of the class-struggle American Left. The tech oligarchs, banks and sick-care cartels, with nothing to fear from the Left, co-opted both parties. The goal was to crush the remnants of middle-class nationalism with the “racism/gender war” tropes and permanently entrench themselves. Had they not bankrupted the country and inundated us with third-world savages, it might have worked. It may yet still work.

        “They are bad people because the believers have declared them to be bad people.”To the extent I know these people are, they are bad people.

Every one of them are weirdos at best.It would be hard to come up with a worse class of people than our business class of rich people.  These are the very same people who sold out their country for coin! They are the people who turned the economy into clownworld.

        The Left isn’t going away.  Progressivism is a religion, not a pastiche Marxist ideology.  It’s backed by the global/ist elite.. . . an ancient and popular religion, no matter whether worship of the feminine is Great Mother, Eleusinian Mysteries, Near East temple-prostitute systems, New Age neo-goddess jive, or mother-son cults stretching back to Babylon and beyond.  This isn’t some cobbled-together, modernist ideology.The heart of the Left is feminism, collective female power, and women are organized — and funded — to the teeth.  They rule the institutions and bureaucratic government. Hundreds of thousands of feminist sub-organizations are loyal to the Hive.  America and her satellites are nation-acolytes of the ‘goddess’ they adore.  America was prepared and founded from these spiritual roots.  Ms. Jensen in fifth grade Social Studies didn’t teach us that.It’s a spiritual war.  To shut down the Left, the nation must confront and crush its gynocentric reverence of the feminine.  The spiritual necessity means over-riding the biological and natal impulses.  That means changing the hearts of the citizenry and elite both.  Good luck with that!  Even the Christians pastors shun the truth.

            In this, we differ; you seem to say that women spontaneously organize such religio-political movements by themselves, something they are prone not do beyond local charity.I say look to the pimps. Pimps “get”women; the worst pimps think like them as well.In Rome, possibly one eighth of the Empire’s population were adherents of this or that “Oriental” mystery cult- by oriental, I mean judaic. Kabbalism is naught but the same frenzied occultism.As far back as “Abraham’s” cult of the bride stealers -(that is, the original state religion of Semitic “Adam” [“true human”] over Aryan “Eve”)- who was intent on seducing Aryan women, who was profitably pimping at the market crossroads and in the temples? Who pimped out the Aryan Benjamite Esther first to one king, then to another? Who dominates (created)the Pornography industry (that is, pimping White women?)Thus, we agree and disagree. Our women were fine until the Freidans, Steinems, and Joyces convinced them they were not, and seduced them with the false promise ofSex in the City.Pimps understand and expoit women’s foibles.I refuse to throw our women under the bus to protect the Holy Ones, who deceitfully let you think that it isyourGod they bring to the world.I saytheyare the infernal influence; we don’t need them to save us, but wemusthave our women. How, then, do we win them back?You are darn right this is a spiritual war, it always has been.The White race is Creation’s antidote to Hell.﻿Our mothers areessentialin the Design.

        Superb article. As Zman seemingly indicates in different words, much of the problem with so-called progressives boils down to the following equation: Christianity minus God equals embittered interlopers continuously causing needless headaches for regular folks. Once you remove theism, which ideally provides a basis for humility and the development of personal virtue, the secularized religion devolves into people indicting anyone but themselves for their own feelings of inferiority, coupled with the urge to proselytize and reorder the natural hierarchy in ways that are rarely specified. The true believers attempt to refashion their self-perceptions of inferiority into a bizarre form of moral superiority. Of course, it’s only bizarre to those outside the self-anointed sect.

        This is a sense of hostility towards something or someone that is viewed as a cause of one’s diminished condition. It is frustration at the sense of inferiority and hatred at a perceived external cause.Yes. Leftism, at all times and in all places is basically the upset, easily-riled and bitter portion of society looking to blame their ills on, mostly, fictional causes. They exhibit neither the Christian ability to accept their position and suffer (although, most Leftist suffering in this modern age is actually “suffering”; a fact that makes their position even more ridiculous), nor the enterprising ability of many of the men thatbuilt things.In fact, I simply see Leftism as resentment, bitterness and anger.Such people are also characterized by an inability to recognize why it is that somethingis the way it is.Before smashing down something, consider why it was there in the first place.In addition, they are oftenrootlesspeople, who feel (and I’m convinced of this) no real, deep nor meaningful connection to their ancestors. Nor to the collective past of the country in which they dwell… they often, at best, feel guilty about such a past; at worst, they hate it and seek to destroy it.Leftism (as persued by GoodWhites and for which they employ the services of legions of coloured sympathizers and hatchet men) is to me the worst thing afflicting our lands at this current time.

            Many women really DO feel inferior to men.  And from the spiritual standpoint of God’s pneuma or imago, they are inferior.  Instead of being content and grateful at their creation and life, they resent the male that God placed over them.
And of-coloreds often DO feel inferior to whites.  As for homos, they damn well know they are effed-up.
Progressivism is the mass politicization of these raging, chaotic, pre-mammalian impulses. It is hubris and rebellion against the good order of God’s provision.

            I take much of what Jesus said applies to our personal relationships however I take it that Christianity believed in the power of the collective state to punish evil doers and this was taught in the epistles.If I represent the state I have no requirement to love and forgive the evil doer or law breaker.My duty is to uphold God’s order.On a personal level I am to forgive and love my enemy but not to the point of self destruction.

I practice this as I don’t let them take up residence in my head. I am glad to hear news of their death. But in the meantime, I let them be a tree that falls in the forest, among others of their ilk… once I retract them from my (business) life.

Two of the dumber, hard-left lefties I know — at one point notably, solemnly declared to me, “I am going to buy a Tesla.”When I asked “why”, each answered along the lines of, “what, you don’t care about the environment…?”One was the last dork to buy, instead, an electric F-150. Brags about how ‘scary fast it is’ … blah blah.I have not informed this super noble, affluenza-inflicted liberal of a book by Henry Ford. Maybe I will have a copy mailed to him.

            Musk should be in prison.  His stupid EVs suck.  I certainly don’t dislike elon for the same reasons the lunatics hate him for, and I suppose hate is a strong word, but he has put millions of vehicles on our public roads with non-functioning cheating software euphemistically named “full self driving”  I have heard with my own ears St Musk say “A Tesla can self drive from LA to NYC without a single intervention TODAY!”  This was in like 2017.  His shitty “Full Self Driving” package will turn itself off milliseconds before a collision and then Tesla (sometimes Musk himself) will announce “full self driving was not engaged at the time of the accident”Musk and Tesla should be liable both civilly and criminally for every death, every major injury and all property damage caused by this software.  EVERY employee of NHTSA should be jailed for not immediately issuing an order to Tesla to recall every single vehicle with FSD to be disabled and forced to issue a refund for the FSD package.  They have failed to perform their function of enforcing safety recalls.  Many, MANY cars have been recalled for far less.

            Elon Musk must be the poster child of the rapid (in political terms) about-face that The Oligarchs have made. I admit my knowledge of Musk’s biography is summary, but unless I’m mistaken, it is worth pointing out that in the “before” time, that is, say no later than early in the Biden years, that Musk was the darling of the Left. To a large extent he’s become the world’s richest man by capitalizing heavily on things government(s) were subsidizing, such as solar electricity, electric vehicles and private space exploration. In brief, Musk was an icon of the Progressives. What? You don’t own a Tesla? What’s the matter with you dude? Don’t you know EVs are the future? At least you can afford a Chevy Volt, can’t you?I don’t know the exact turning point, but surely when Musk bought Twitter it signaled loud and clear that he was no longer on Team Progressive.Anyway, curious times we live in, when some of the world’s richest and most powerful publicly change – or at least have claimed to change – their political allegiances. Among these count Mark Zuckerberg, etc.Richest man in the world still? Well, maybe not, seeing the beating TSLA is taking. Do we have a real-world emulation of Ayn Rand’s capitalist heroes fromAtlas Shruggedpitting their private fortunes in an attempt to save the world? Or truer to the plot line, to hasten the downfall of the old, diseased order?

        The trouble for the people we call the left is that Christianity is a life-denying religion in that what matters is what comes after this life. The faithful navigate this world of sin to reach everlasting life after death. For those who care only about this life, this cannot work, so those Christian ethics at the core of what we call the left quickly curdled into a bundle of resentments and hatreds.There’s a succinct name for this phenomenon. It’s called Satanism. It’s the anti-religion that strips God from the picture, elevates man into his place, and inverts all moral norms, starting with basing everything on active covetousness, which is the sin mentioned most frequently in the ten commandments.

        “Hate white man” is the manifestation of hate Jesus Christ. The later is what they have at the back of their mind, but they cannot always say it openly. (I am not saying that Jesus Christ was a white man, but merely describing the picture the leftists have in their mind.)Once you see the developments through the anti-Christianity angle, everything else falls into place. Modern left adapted Progressive religion of early 1900s, but turned it into an anti-Christian cult. So, the language of helping the downtrodden remains, but downtrodden is redefined to include anything and anyone unapproved by Christianity. Hence the worship of rainbow flags, gays and lesbians. In the meanwhile, the real downtrodden dying on the streets are ignored.

            Agreed.  The Left, essentially a feminine phenomenon or cult, hates God the Father above all.  Even when they live amidst a veritable gynocracy, they wail and moan about Teh Patriarchy, by which they mean the Christian God and no other.
Likewise, this is why their Left’s financial and enforcement support comes from luciferian elites, principally of the West.  For example, the Rockefellers funded and shepherded feminism from the Fifties to present.
It’s a spiritual war.

        Resentments are only thing that unites the modern left, and after October 7th, they turned them on each other. They will now go underground and fester, occasionally emerging from their holes in bouts of spasmodic violence.
However, they will return as a (semi) organized force in a decade or so, unless prevailing demographics are addressed with more than just the deportation of criminal aliens. The passing of the boomers, for all their faults, will see the end of consensus politics, and herald the advent of a nihilistic free for all, unless and until a dominant occidental majority is restored.

        The freak show that emerged after 2020 surely woke up a lot of grillers. It wasn’t just the BLM people, or the Antifa degenerates, but the actual people in government. There was no way someone with a job and a kid could look at Sam Brinton or Rachel Levine and think that these are the people they should throw their lot in. Joe Biden was by far the most normal person in that administration and the fact that he was a doddering senile old man said everything about the future of this party. I suspect this is a large driver in “Hispanic” support for Trump in 2024. I think it is not an accident that Gavin Newsom has a podcast where he talked to Steve Bannon. But if the Democrat party is sloughing off normal people like Newsom, and the left is already resorting to violence and vandalism, then 2028 might be even more of a ridiculous carnival than 2024 was.

            As I said at Founding Questions this weekend:IFthe Dems have learned their lesson, they are going to go with, brace yourselves, a White Guy. And a Straight White Guy. Who can mouth the moderate platitudes, looks telegenic, and has more than a base level of charisma. Identity politics at this point is going to lose fringe / swing voters.I followed that with:Of course, as David Thompson would say at his blog,IFis doing an enormous amount of lifting there.

                Well, the Dems are a top-down organization that hasn’t run a legitimate primary since 2008. Newsom is obviously trying to turn into the “common sense” Democrat but the party is already trying to “discourage” him by running articles about how it is hurting him with the party, with the clear implication being that this will hurt him in the primary if he keeps doing it. I think it would be very tough for Gavin Newsom to emerge from the DNC primaries and he would have to take a lot of criticism and attacks he is not used to getting, being a hothouse flower.

                Some lessons the Ds may be incapable of learning. For instance, the electability of women presidential candidates. It’s entirely plausible that the emergence of Trump is primarily due to AINO being unwilling to elect a woman to that office, especially a D woman (I’ve long said that the first woman president will have to be an R, but that’s another discussion).But the problem for the Ds is that they aren’t even allowed, in this context or any  other, to question whether or not they should be nominating women. Not even in their own personal internal monologues. And you can’t fix a problem that you can’t identify. I got banned from Naked Capitalism some time back for posting this same thing. That’s how verboten it is among “leftists” to bring it up.Looking at Biden, obviously they don’t have a major problem “nominating” a white guy. But the TDS makes them ever crazier. I wouldn’t be surprised if they nominate a tranny. Whoever it is, it’s either preordained or it’s about to be. Because they don’t do primaries on the up and up.

        “a post about why deporting anti-Israel protestors is a good start”
No it isn’t. If they have a green card/visa and they aren’t breaking any laws, deporting them for expressing political opinions is very un-American.
I can’t say this enough: FVCK ISRAEL.

            FVCK Israel – yes, agreed.  But if somone has a green card/visa they are not yet even magic paper citizens, and they have no magic constitutional protections.  I didn’t get involved in politics when I lived in England, or the USSR.  I was a GUEST.  Not my place to get involved or protest.  If you are a guest, you should keep your political opinions private.  And ‘free speech’ is wildly over-rated.  If there is ever a White polity, why ought it allow ‘free speech’ in favor of diversity?  The reality of the world is not ‘muh rights,’ it is WHO/WHOM.

                I can’t say I disagree completely. I do believe in being a POLITE guest. However, I was listening to Napolitano the other day and he says as long as they aren’t breaking any laws, the government is way off base deporting people for political activity involving their homeland which has been fairly common throughout history.
I can’t help but think that small hats in our government are behind this which makes this even more offensive to me. The US shouldn’t be in the business of policing opinions that go against the small hats.

                    Nap is a gay libertarian prone to flights of fancy, and more to the point, wrong here. There are no constraints–NONE–in expelling a Green Card holder who violates certain resident rules. I’m not saying this will be a 9-0 ruling–there is a Jewess and other undesirables on the Court–but it will be close to it.

                        Yeah, but doesn’t it upset you that these people are getting ejected only because they are expressing opinions contrary to the interests of our greatest ally? I mean, if they were protesting something like deforestation, nobody would bother them. If these people being deported were at a protest demanding more school funding would anybody bother them?
It’s only because they protest against the interest of the small hats that they are getting kicked out of this country.
Just another example of that 1% controlling the system and manipulating it for their own interests.

                            Anything the normalizes deportation is to be applauded. You are correct that the only reason this cat is being deported is due to who/whom but it will increase public acceptance of throwing out non-whites even if it is not framed that way. It also is helpful that people are being forced to realize who is, or at least was, largely in charge of everything. And, again, this actually is “lawful,” as if that matters. Also, in the long term, this makes people even madder at the Tribe. Again, win/win.

                Agree. Even in “normal” times, you’d be amazed what rights legally present aliensdon’thave, compared to full citizens. Just off the top of my head: If you’re here on a tourist visa, you can stay 30 or 90 days or whatever. But paid emplacement? Hell no. Here on a student visa? Well, of course you can get educated and maybe work a certain number of hours subject to restrictions (e.g. on-campus jobs only).There are some obscure restrictions too. Many years ago here in the Tampa area [If I recall details correctly] the Feds arrested an Egyptian national on terrorist related charges. I don’t recall what his then-current legal status was, but here’s what’s relevant: he had previously been here on a student visa. During that time, he had visited a rifle range and fired a rifle there. Based on evidence (video I suppose) the Feds were able to claim that he had possessed a firearm and this violated his visa. At the time I thought that was reaching, but it shows what the Feds can resort to. I don’t know the disposition of the suspect’s case.More relevant to current discussion and recent news events are what rights, and to what degree, do aliens have in terms of freedom of speech and political activity? I admit I don’t know, but seems to me that it’d be reasonable to place firm limits on those. Now I would say that Ibrahim shouldn’t be deported merely because he’s written a research paper on a controversial topic or even is a member of the Muslim Student Association. But organizing protests? At some point a line is crossed. Surely illegal activity should be punished including by deportation.From having studied retirement in foreign countries, I do recall the general case that, even if one became a permanent legal resident (but non-citizen) it was generally verbotten to involve oneself in the host country’s politics in any way, shape or form, if you wanted to remain in good graces. In the case of Mexico, a nation that is relatively easy to acquire various types of non-citizen resident visas for, even the highest level one would give one all the rights of a citizenexceptthe right to vote and (I’m assuming) a similar proscription of meddling in local politics. I doubt the USA is very similar, but I think Mexico’s policies would be excellent to adopt here.

                Well, I’m not against the Jews as people, but the same could be said about them. It seems like the same pattern repeats throughout history: They get too big for their britches, start abusing their position and then people start singling them out.

                    That’s exactly what they accused Jews of in ancient Egypt (c.1500BC), Germany (1930s), the Soviet Union (starting in 1950s), Iraq (1940s) and on and on. Do you remember what eventually happened to all these countries?

You’re like locust, you move to wherever the Gentiles are prosperous and then begin the parasitic process that human tapeworms like you are so universally reviled for.  I couldn’t imagine the inferiority complex I would have knowing that I need leech off of other’s to survive as a people.

        You see this with the “left’s” fascination with status. A stratification of society that you would presume would violate their foundational principals. They always feel they deserve more, whether it’s money or respect. That’s why they claim that they are the “educated” party, and also why, at universities, the more worthless the area of concentration the more likely they will demand the honorific of “Dr.”.

        Over the last half century or so, the people known as the left made too much money to be leftists anymore (at least in the traditional economic sense). This led to a lot of contradictions, which they have attempted to paper over with ridiculous boutique beliefs, to disguise the fact that they became what they were supposed to oppose. What was historically called leftism hardly exists today, and probably can’t exist in a globalized economy. Oddly enough, leftism (as traditionally understood) needs nationalism in order to exist. Otherwise, it is either erased or transmogrifried by globalism into something else. As we have seen.

                There is some seemingly innate need, with a certain segment, to self identify as “left” or “progressive,” in spite of all material and hierarchical circumstances to the contrary. Their hatred of normal christian whites is just that intense.

        My personal experience has been that lefties are losers, full of envy and bitter rage. Which is what you’ve already said. But in addition there’s no solidarity among them, which might be a saving grace. If any of them were to win the lottery, his or her stance would be, “Bye-bye, losers.” The only solidarity among them is what we call “negative solidarity” — that since I have to suffer, so should everyone else.

        Resentment is a normal human feeling. A normal sin, if you want it. It has existed in all ages.
What makes resentment extremely powerful in our age is equality. If every man is equal and group X has more than group Y, the onlypossibleexplanation  is that group X oppresses group Y.  So resentment is masked as search for justice, as a fight against the injustice. A sin is masked as a virtue.

        While those hatreds provided a rally point for a period, no movement can exist only on hatred.On the other hand:Not all religions have a God, but they all have a devil.The Left thrived for almost a century with an almost exclusive focus on the devil, so its collapse (and that is what is happening to it) is due to other, far more mundane reasons. I would suggest loss of a carefully curated and monopolized media is playing a key role. The previous definition of “devil,” was “white” or “whiteness” or whatever, and could not withstand much if any scrutiny or criticism. Additionally, the American Left is batshit insane and unless that is hidden better it cannot thrive. This is not to claim unbridled censorship cannot return with a fury or whatever, but something new and different would be required even if it the old information monopoly returned. We are fully into the post-World War II consensus, and that, at least, ain’t coming back. Post-modernism thrived in that environment, and it seems unlikely it can continue unchallenged with what comes afterwards.

        I was driving up to the mountains over the weekend and passed a white Tesla 3 with what looked like a home-printed bumper sticker that read, “I bought this before Elon went crazy.”That struck me as humorous because it betrays to complete narcissism of the people we call the left. On one hand, they clearly bought the Tesla because doing so made them one of the chosen people. On the other hand, they need the bumper sticker to say to everyone, “I’m still on the team, don’t blame me!”. On the other hand, they acknowledge the violence of their belief system and the bumper sticker is a simple plea, “Please don’t key my car!” And on the other hand (yes, we’re up to four hands, but that is the point) the bumper sticker is a vague attempt at Meta, “I bought a Tesla, look at me!” which is why they bought the Tesla in the first place but never explicitly stated until they slapped on their homemade bumper sticker.The violence against Telsa reveals the fundamental fraud at the heart of the progressive movement. It’s all fake. All of it. The Tesla isn’t saving the planet, and the planet is not in need of saving. Not from cars or gas stoves, anyway. Their vaunted ActBlue fundraising prowess? Turns out it is a massive money laundering operation and utterly fraudulent. Their media dominance? GOVERNMENT FUNDED through USAID (and other).Wait until people start really looking into their voting totals from 2020, 2022, and 2024…The collapse in effective resistance is because everything they once said they were for – peace, government accountability, fiscal responsibility, body autonomy, free speech – they oppose. And all the things they said they were against – warrantless spying, weaponized government, war, globalism, censorship – they are for.And it is so completely obvious that it has pushed them over the edge mentally. It’s passé to point out that they couldn’t bring themselves to stand and clap for Cancer Kid, but there’s the madness at work. Then there’s that clip of Fauxcahontas maniacally clapping for more war in Ukraine.They have gone mad from the fever but the fever has not yet broke…The ones who aren’t crazy, those who simply believed what they were being told, are now fully awake to the fraud.  That means fewer donations, fewer foot soldiers, and that means the only ones left are the batshit crazy ones doing driveby shootings of Tesla dealerships where their progressive friends proudly work to “save the planet”.

        As usual well said. I find interesting parallels between your description of the left and the alcoholic personality. Both are based on the inability of the entity to get its own way and misbehaving like a 2 year old having a temper tantrum when it fails to get its way.Thanks.

            When A.A. was quite young, a number of eminent psychologists and doctors made an exhaustive study of a good-sized group of so-called problem drinkers. The doctors weren’t trying to find how different we were from one another; they sought to find whatever personality traits, if any, this group of alcoholics had in common. They finally came up with a conclusion that shocked the A.A. members of that time. These distinguished men had the nerve to say that most of the alcoholics under investigation were still childish, emotionally sensitive, and grandiose.

^^^That right there is Cluster B in a nutshell.
God knows our society is DROWNING in Cluster B.
And now the alcoholics have access to SSRIs, ritalin, adderall, benzodiazipines, fentanyl, extremely potent marijuana, etc etc etc…
And I’m not crazy about these kooks drinking gallons of caffeine every day.
Caffeine turns mildly prickly personalities into outright thermonukular personalities.

I feel like Cluster B has been propagate and weaponized by the usual suspects with the end goal of destroying relations between Western men and women.
In this, they have largely succeeded.

                What they might have left out is how many ‘alcoholics’ were Type A achievers, driven, that needed alcohol to turn off the mind and relax. Before long, MADD allowed the same impulses that drove women to want any and all un-masked to be sent to camps … to weaponize the issue from an unassailable moral high ground.tl;dr before Covid Karen was MADD Karen, who would have you thrown in a Gulag for driving “drunk” while lobbying to have the ‘legal limits’ driven ever lower until LEO types had total discretion to serve up anyone that hade the equivalent of one drink .. to their master$ in the insurance industry, et. al.

                    Yes. The stated goal of ending substance abuse never was the actual goal. The actual goal was redemption. Also note the original Temperance Union leaders often were women. All radical politics and movements at their core are feminine, which is why it always was recognized that women are highly unsuited to participate in areas of life where they can dominate through fanaticism. The ruins of Western Civilization testify.

                        There are posters from 100+ years ago that feature women that says, “Lips that touch liquor shall not touch ours. As always, women are the vanguard of any radical movement, and they always use access to sex to gain support from men. Nothing ever changes. They said the same thing as they made up a good 80% of marchers during BLM.In a way, even this dynamic has been neutered, as young men are falling so far behind women and are so disenfranchised by the system that they simply do not expect to live the normal trappings of a griller life, with a pretty wife and kids, so they are seeing this as an empty threat. Which, of course, makes the women more unhinged.

Feminism is very popular, because it puts a lot of rice in a lot of bowls.  Including the bowls of Christian and ‘conservative’ people.  It is a heavily incentivized, heavily underwritten operation.

                    MADD turned into a Prohibitionist organization long ago. Its founder, Candace Lightner long ago left the organization after recognizing this (unwanted) development. As with many such organizations, when it achieved its initial objectives, it simply morphed into what Eric Hoffer sagely called “a racket”. In short, MADD had too good a thing going for it, so typical “mission creep” set in.For example, MADD has promoted blood alcohol levels as low an .05%, and a prohibition on all alcohol advertisement, This short sightedness misses what is now the greatest problem of drink drivers currently arrested, the “problem” drinker. Here is AZ, the stat’s are announced after every holiday season wrt the drunk driver dragnets set up. About 2/3’s of the drunk drivers arrested have a blood alcohol content of .2+%—not .08%!. These drivers also have a long record of arrests, no insurance, and their cars are “borrowed”.Yet the (ignorant) answer by MADD is to reduce the presumed impairment level for BAC to an even lower amount—as if this will reduce the problem. The latest problem of course is the new—and legal—drug of choice, marijuana. Last I checked, no good test for impairment existed and was a persistent complaint from law enforcement.These problems are inevitably leading to a reduction in freedom.  Latest laws passed require auto manufacturers to equip all new vehicles with remote shutdown capability—of course for law enforcement use only—and passive monitoring for driver impairment, of course with auto shutdown of vehicle as well.  This will not prevent the problem as alcoholic drivers will equip themselves with older model cars and continue in their ways.

                        Thank gosh somebody finally pointed out MADD’s origin.  The founder (I think) had a young relative killed by a severe problem drinker recidivist who had been let off the hook time after time.
It used to be drinking and driving was legal; however, if you truly effed up, say, killed someone in an accident, the penalty was 8 years in prison for manslaughter.

                        Since MADD has been mentioned, I always balked at the assertion that alcoholism is a disease.  Is there any rational justification for this?  Maybe this is semantic fussiness, but the assertion that “X is a disease” has always bothered me.
I accept that alcoholics may have a genetic predisposition to drink, but how is that a disease?

                            The disease aspect (not choosing sides here) I’ve always categorized under the heading of “refusal to accept accountability” for one’s actions.  Who cannot forgive an individual for contracting a disease?  That why AA has always attracted me.  One tenant is that *you* accept complete and total responsibility for your condition.

        What Z wrote is largely true but irrelevant. All that matters in a democracy are the wishes of the 1 percent. The most powerful block in the 1 percent are the Jews.As I keep pointing out Trump was only allowed to win because he made a convincing case that he was best for Israel which was the central issue for the 1 percent in 2024.We don’t know yet what will be the top issue in the midterms or 2028: Israel or destroying white countries.It simply doesn’t matter what percentage of the population has a good view of the Democrats. They will still get around half the vote even if they have to vote 10 times from the grave.There is always a chance more of the 1 percent will go rouge but we don’t know that yet.

        I used to daydream when I was a kid about being Elvis. There was a movie where he was riding around in a convertible, a Chrysler I think, car full of women, singing. I wanted to be Elvis.Now not only couldn’t you pay me enough to be famous, I realize how empty fame is. First of all, unless you are Jennifer Aniston or some other superstar, they don’t really make a lot of money. Second of all, you’ve got no privacy. And finally, you don’t work and rub elbows with the best class of people. I’ve started looking down on most of these people at bar whores.Why anybody would want to be famous or worships these celebrities is beyond me.

        I’ve only ever seen the term ressentiment one other place – Nietzsche. Z man has the right of it yet with one omission: The class feeling ressentiment knows (or at least believes) they are powerless to improve their condition. This all ties in with Nietzsche’s concepts of master vs. slave morality; it is the peons who suffer ressentiment.Grammatical note: “Ressentiment” is only a distant cousin to the more common “resentment.” Feel free to peruse the distinct definitions at your leisure.—Z: “The trouble for the people we call the left is that Christianity is a life-denying religion in that what matters is what comes after this life.”Partly true, but again, needing nuance (or futher muddying the philosophical waters?) Per Herr Nietzsche, Christianity is a life-denying religion precisely becauseit denies the importance of this lifeand, like (nearly?) every other form of mysticism ever hatched by man, does by so dazzling the believer withpromises(or threats) of some hereafter.Godless heathen I may be, I make allowances that religion may provide some benefits in the sense that your actions today may have good (or bad) effects for the world that remains here after you’ve departed. Any number of examples might be found viz. the man who plants trees under whose shade he’ll never rest, but perhaps his great-grandchildren will.In fairness, Nietzsche found similarly against many religions; he doesn’t solely castigate Christianity, though it was beyond all doubt his main whipping boy.Nor is this to claim everything Herr Fritz said is Gospel. It’s not entirely clear to me that a Master morality is the best answer (unless, perhaps, I were in the Nobility). I’m sure it’s all great fun to be a “blond beast of prey” and run amok raping looting and pillaging with impunity. On the other hand, I can see why the serfs, “the herd” might want to form their own union against the Owners.

                Oh, they existed all right. They still do, in the sense that in nearly all times and places there is a minority who rule and a multitude who are ruled over.In the primitive state, the dominant are those with the most prowess, cunning, etc. As things become more “civilized” there is (usually) greater benefits for everyone, but there is still that elite that is privileged in various ways, supported by the peons.It goes by different names, “oppressor” and “oppressed” will do if you’re a Marxist, I suppose. But the point remains: in Nature there is nearly always a “rank order”, a hierarchy. And that implies a few at the top, more in the middle, and a whole lot at the bottom.Nietzsche’s point, at least as I took it, is that the “Nobility” viewed itself as the “good”. The commoner, the proletariat, were “bad” (which is distinct from “evil”). In this view, “bad” simply means they did not rise to the high standards of the nobility. It wasn’t the serf’s fault he was a lowly wretch, that was merely his nature.The Slave, when he created his own morality, of necessity had to invert Master’s values so it should be unsurprising that Master was dubbed “evil”. Notably, the Slaves generally advocated that the entire herd were equal precisely because Master morality required that a ranking exist.Note that I’m not saying that Nietzsche is 100% correct. Surely there are aspects of his writing that are wishful thinking or myth. As I said before (and I’m probably miscategorizing Nietzsche in saying so) I don’t particularly think that a horde of blond barbarians burning villages and raping the women represents the pinnacle of Master morality.

            Pity— too much conscience. The next life to the point of denying this one. Becoming a doormat. Nietzsche understood the problems of taking the Christian ethic too far.Maybe he was just being polemical, but I suspect he overreacted. Not sure I’d call him neopagan, but he obviously looked back to pagan Europe for the whole blonde beast thing.Maybe I’m wrong, idk, I think I remember reading somewhere the pagan ethic was about embracing life and fate— but also doing good things for your people. The glory of Rome, all those temples and baths erected by this or that person, etc.Maybe that omission is the source of his reputation for nihilism, idk.

            I think it’s even worse than what you and Z-Man are positing.My gut instinct is that the core of 21st Century “Leftism” is [or was, until Trump II] a combination of massive financial chicanery at the High End, anddeeplyhorrifyingly cynical manipulation of outright Mental Illness at the Low End.Basically it amounted to Mesopotamian Financialists controlling the flow of money out of the Federal Reserve, combined withMesopotamian sooth-sayers controlling the edumakashunal institutions, where they recruited and SELECTED the very most impressionable &amp; mesmerizable &amp; hypnotizable personalities as their rank &amp; file street thugs.It’s very very difficult for us normal folk to fathom the psychopathy and the sadism of the Mesopotamians.The news is filled with stories like the following:Some Federal Workers Face Mental Health Struggles As Cuts BiteMarch 17, 2025https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4304776/postsHalifax rage room offering framed pictures of Donald Trump, Elon Musk to smash03/16/2025https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/4304774/postsIt is not a random coincidence that the Left is now completely nuts.A very viciously brutally cynical Psy-Op was brainwashed into the minds of the greater Anglosphere, and huge portions of the Anglosphere were sucked into that Psy-Op and completely wrecked psychologically.

                BTW, the most fascinating piece of news today is that Trump has declared every executive order signed by Joe Biden’s “Auto Pen” to be null and void; effectively declaring that all of Joe Biden’s “Auto Signatures” were counterfeits [signed by the various Mesopotamian conmen which manned his presidency].
Is this Peak Clownworld yet?
If not, then I’m getting mildly terrified as to what Peak Clownworld is gonnaackshuallylook like, once it finally arrives.
I’m not looking forward to that day.

                    You miss the point. These EO’s and the continuing of enforcement of such despite a lower court injunction is precisely to drive the final decision to the SCOTUS before time runs out. The more of these that occur, the more the heat is turned up on SCOTUS to come to some resolution. SCOTUS like all courts, is loath to involve itself in political matters. Always has been. Ignoring these matters has been their forte—but no longer.You can run, but you can’t hide. When SCOTUS decides against Trump and Trump says screw you, then get nervous.  On the other hand, I for one welcome the courts being taken down a peg or two.  They were always supposed to be the weakest of the three branches and decidedly so.  Their power was exaggerated to excess when they made liberal decisions beginning in the 60’s.  They’ve outlived their usefulness.

                        The facts of this seem obvious – Biden was non compos mentis, he signed these pardons with a fake signature device that anyone could use, which means we don’t know WHO signed these, and without evidence that Biden actually signed them, they are invalid. Nobody questions that Biden has pardon power but it has to be Biden doing the pardoning. This is especially obvious considering many of the pardons issued whichw ere so out of step of Biden’s entire career… but totally in step with the lunatics running the WH.However, I really do not see, even if this went before SCOTUS 100 times, them ever making this ruling.

                            The aspect of the auto pen is not ipso facto evidence of the document being invalid.  Two aspects must be proved (IIRC):  That Biden did not authorize autosigning and that Biden did not know what was in the documents being autosigned.
Seems that both of these aspects become harder and harder to prove as time passes and Biden sinks into complete incompetence, which seems to have been already been stated after the DOJ interviewed him on his sequestered secret documents investigation a year or so ago.

                What made the Anglosphere susceptible to manipulation is that from 1500 on, it has always been primarily a mercantile concern. Probably all thalassocracies are. The pursuit of money, and the elevation of moneyed elites creates vulnerabilities. Protestantism, with its emphasis on material prosperity and collective salvation, exacerbated this trend.
”Mesopotamians”, lol. Akkadians, more specifically, but, alas, not everyone is a nerd.

            Every notable bloc except the usual whites (married, poorer, etc.), the funny-hat Jews, and injun men voted for Harris.In post-America, presidential voting patterns display nearness to, identification with, andthe favor ofpower. The winner party gets “the rich,” of course. Trannies and the rest of the sexual marketplace clearance rack—the people the term “bioleninism” brings to mind—are traditionally courtiers, spies, enforcers, etc. (The tranny jannie is an eternal archetype.) Since the Democrats becameexplicitlythe regime party, fully dedicated to domestic repression, such “marginal” categories have become loyal partisans.The slight—and it isslight—recent shift of minority men away from the Democrats signifies that the most normal among them are getting screwed, losing their (sense of) privilege to more exotic specimens. The great male exceptions, the only men who are unswayable current_regime loyalists, are non-orthodox Jews and Indians. They can’tmake moreJews, but…The Republicans are the designated loser party, not only in the old Globetrotters/Generals sense. Winners may have found a use for it, but the idea that anyone envies it is insane—or from 1985.(I hear Justine Bateman is based.)

        The Left’s last great cause was universal government run healthcare.  They fell quite a bit short with Obamacare, which is basically just subsidized catastrophic health insurance for the poor.  In a sense, we dodged a bullet.  This last great issue has been taken off the table, in exchange for a system that is not much different than we had before.

                I agree, but every other system devolves into rationing health care in some manner as that which is “free” has no limitation on demand.  Of course, the elite of any such country has access to all the health care that they can afford.  In short, the same “two tier” system you decry.  The difference is that I would like to avail myself of whatever I can afford and not be restricted to the “dirt people’s” health care.  In there lies the rub.

                    They say Switzerland has the best mix. Healthcare for everyone, and if you want something over and above that, i.e. non-rationed care, you can have a private insurance add on. I wonder if somebody has done a calculation as to what all of the overhead in the system is costing us. Paper shufflers, computer programmers, CEOs, etc. We have great medical care, but it has gotten to the point where the cost is unsustainable, not to mention that the nicest office buildings going up in any City these days tend to be medical buildings.

                        Not sure about the cost remark.  I’ve used “Medicare”.  They send me a statement—not a bill.  The statement is what hey’ve been billed by the medical provider and what they’ve paid.  Medicare pays—as I read the statement—typically something like 10% of what’s billed.No, I don’t get billed for the other 90% as that is against the law and why they send me the statement.  Bold letter at the bottom not to pay any other bills related to this medical expense. So the whole thing is some sort of Kabuki dance from what I see.Something is indeed wrong, but to show a “bill” for tens of thousands of dollars where the real “transaction” settles for a 10th of the amount seems fishy.  None of this of course addresses those with no insurance.

                        ^^^ The Swiss example may not be the best since it involves an insurance mandate and is not particularly cheap, however, there are other countries that have the dual model of government health care with private insurance add-ons.

                Something will eventually happen, but imagine the health system run by the hippos at the DMV.  That’s what we’ll get.  As bad as things are we’ll make it worse.  Anyway, I doubt Americans will voluntarily swallow the overt rationing such as system would require.  Or the cost-driven necessity of cutting off old people.  That last would be bitterly opposed by the system itself – too profitable.

            One needs to separate symbolism from concept.  EV’s are here to stay and I predict will continue to expand.  Talk to any engineer, I have one in the family, they will tell you the engineering/maintenance/cost advantages in EV’s.  The problem is in not allowing the infrastructure and technology to mature at its own pace.  A typical problem with government selecting winners and losers in the free market.The problem is one of government regulation and ideology, not one of technology.  WRT to passenger cars—not trucks or delivery vehicles—last year was the largest sales year for EV’s (even with reduced incentives) at 20% of vehicles produced.  Best year ever.Disclaimer, I own an EV.  My next car on order is an ICE vehicle.  EV’s work in their niche, so do ICE vehicles.

        The Democratic Party, a “big tent” of geeks, minorities, and bishes, has always been a party of losers and weaklings. Whereas the fascist admires strength, the liberal admires compassion, a womanly attribute that turns the beholder into a dainty little saint marching in protests. The suffocating moralism of the left, which the right sees as degeneracy, is a sledgehammer wielded to break up society into tinier and tinier pieces. The only antidote for liberalism remains, as always, a brisk sense of realism.
