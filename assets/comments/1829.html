        The term “reparations” has been much discussed by liberal blogs.  We are meant to understand that when he writes “reparations”, he doesn’t mean, like, REPARATIONS reparations, he means, like, conversations about privelege and power, and stuff, right, like white people need to recognize how society’s inherent racism totally advantages them and stuff.

        When Reagan was persuaded to go along with the initial Illegal Alien Amnesty, it was presented to him on the basis that it would settle the issue ‘once and for all.’  That worked out well, didn’t it?

        Reparations? Really?  Somebody please tell my Mexican wife which of Oprahs mansions she  should mail her reparations check to.  How about Obama? He’s half and half. Does he get a reparations check? Will it be pro-rated at 50%. Who’s black? How do we decide? Is it based on say so? Fine, I’m black. Send me a check. No? So we have to do DNA testing to determine who’s black? Of all 320 million people? Good luck with that. What’s the standard for who qualifies and who doesn’t when this testing is done? Who decides? But beyond that, why am I (and my immigrant wife) paying for the sins of my father? This is an absolutely ridiculous idea that is not even remotely being thought through.

        I can pretty much guarantee that if such payments were ever made, it would make absolutely no difference.  There is no rational way to approach these people.

        seventeen trillion in entitlement payouts since ’64. seventeen trillion in debt. coincidence? all debts public and private have been paid, and my children’s future mortgaged to do it. eg, Pigford v. Glickman. time to declare “reparations” over and done forever.
