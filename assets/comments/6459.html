        The Huffington Post is all in a lather this morning, check out their headline. Reduced to name calling because – “gasp” – people came out in droves for Trump. Did you know that when they first started covering Trump they placed any stories about him in their Entertainment section, saying that he couldn’t be taken seriously? And now he’s on their main page. Boom!

        Gore lost because of his clown makeup in the debate. Romney (and Ryan) lost because they let obama and biden laugh at them in their respective debates without slapping the grins off their stupid faces. That would have won the election for Romney/Ryan in itself. But they didn’t have the balls to even argue, much less give the jerks what they so badly needed.

            The first debate, Gore was making all sorts of weird noises and rolling his eyes like he was having a seizure. That was the story after the debate. Allegedly, he was advised to do it. Then there was the VP debate with Cheney and Lieberman looking rather courtly the whole night. The press fawned over it, comparing Lieberman favorably to Gore. The next debate, Gore came out dressed in the same outfit as Lieberman, using his one liners and mannerisms. It was bizarre and I think a lot of people wondered about his sanity at that point.The other problem he had was the crazy lurch to the Left on guns and social issues. He lost his home state over it. He probably could have overcome the debates, but the all over the map campaign and the bizarre TV behavior swayed enough voters to cost him key states. Rubio just saw his campaign go up in flames by making a fool of himself in the last debate. Quayle never recovered from being bitch slapped by Bentson. Rick Perry is out of work because he could not remember his name at a debate.The point is, Bush was not carried to victory by an enthusiastic electorate. He was the least bad choice. If your party is based on hoping the other guys screw up, you may as well disband.

                Obama won the last elections by a very narrow margin against a very uncharismatic candidate so it cuts both ways. By the way, Ben Shapiro claims Obama won because his campaign portrayed the Conservative candidate as an evil man who puts puppies on his car and kills his employees, is selfish and awful while the Conservative candidate praised Obama as a decent human being. Shapiro points out the left always paints the right as immoral and the right always tries to argue the left is ineffective and the public will prefer someone ineffective over someone evil. There’s some truth to that too.

        I agree that the GOP has sold out the American worker (this from the carpenter son of an electrician) My Rust Belt late home town is dead in the water, probably never to rise again. There’s something unsettling about Trump though, he’s unvetted, of bombastic temperament, speaks in generalities. Beware the man on the white horse.

            Unvetted? How so, exactly? The media have been up his ass with a microscope since the mid-80s, when he became one of their favorite punching bags. He’s been easily the most-scrutinized Presidential candidate in American history. Frankly, I can’t think of who comes in second; they are so far in back of Trump they aren’t even visible.As far as “bombastic” goes– you obviously can’t be over 40. If you were, you’d realize that, for almost 30 years, political candidates have been entirely fagged-up to appeal to women and beta males. What you mistake for “bombastic” is good old alpha-male signaling. Goldwater, Reagan, JFK, LBJ and even Nixon– those were MEN, and they weren’t afraid to show it.You’re right about one thing: Trump does speak in generalities. So what? That’s what Obama did, and it got him elected twice, even though he was a piece of shit in a brown paper bag that the media set on fire and left on our collective doorsteps.

        Sorry,  Trump is a spoiled rich kid at 70 years old.   I’m a dirt guy if I follow the argument, but I’ve run a small international engineering business for 25 years (and my dad was in commercial real estate).   In general business is still a win-win affair where you treat the other guy with some respect.  Trump shorts his contractors and sues his partners frequently, while behaving like a child.  But people seem to think this Hollywood portrayal of a “tough businessman” is the real thing.   There is a reason Trump doesn’t do much on his own anymore.  He can’t get people to work with him.Your going to hire a President,  look behind the curtain.

                Yes, it’s pretty much just making the best of an all around bad situation. There is no Man on the White Horse. Its hard to imagine a worse president than the current occupant of the White House, so I’m willing to roll the dice on the Donald.

        The Dirt people are not generally registered Republicans.  So in an open primary like NH and against a long line-up of opponents, Trump wins easily.  In closed primaries like Iowa and SC, he’ll lose unless the rest of the votes are split too many ways.
Trump winning or losing may just be a matter of how soon most of his opponents drop out and consolidate the rest of the vote.

            The trouble with that is NH is not an open primary. You had to register by October or November of last year. Democrats had to vote in their primary and Republicans in their primary. The undeclared could pick one, but they automatically became a Democrat or Republican once they declared. To change that they will need to file paperwork with the state. That’s why the percentage of undeclared is about 15%. It’s now a hassle to strike that pose.Even so, Trump won across all demographics. His numbers were fairly consistent too. His win was about as broad based as you can get in a multi-candidate field. SC does present some challenges, but it is a quirky state that tends to like populist renegades. They went for Gingrich over the party man in 2012. They went for McCain over the Evangelical in 2008. Ted Cruz will work the western part of the state as that’s a different culture from the eastern part of the state. Trump will once again focus on the big population centers.

        May I recommend a sampling of Z’s absurdly fine blogroll, “Why Trump?” from Free Northerner:“Average Americans have to glance over their shoulders and make sure there are no hostile commissars around before they declare support for a mainstream political candidate. This is happening not in the USSR, but in the USA.This is why we support Trump.We *ucking fear you and we *ucking hate you.”(In the comments is a link to the windy Archdruid Report, who submits that we have seen the wage earner class decimated to the benefit of the salary class.  The rentier class and welfare class remain largely unchanged.  Interesting.)Read the whole thing!

            More Free Northern goodness:“We don’t *ucking care about your “conservative principles” of hating Russia (the only major power fighting degeneracy and supporting the church).We don’t care if his Christian convictions are superficial (it’s been 40 years and you’ve done *hit all about Roe, not to mention you’ve done nothing to prevent Christians from having their businesses destroyed by kangaroo courts). We don’t care if he gave money to Democrats a decade ago  (y’all keep importing new voters for them).”Hallelujah!

                It’s why I mock people who insist Trump is fueled by anger. It’s more about bewilderment. People look at the results of the last twenty-five years and they are dumbfounded as to why they should keep voting for the same guys.
