        Raylen Givens was not a ‚Äúnormal looking man‚Äù. He was seriously hot with a healthy dose of Southern bad-ass charm. But I guess I get your drift in that he was not effeminate in any way. I really enjoyed Justified, and my favorite character was Boyd Crowder. Although he was  Raylen‚Äôs arch-nemesis, and one of the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù, he was another real man, handsome, charming, and a complex character whose next move was not always predictable.

        They had pretty good ‚Äúgun stuff‚Äù on Justified, too.  None of these vastly ignorant ‚ÄúGlock clocking‚Äù noises that get added in post-production whenever the hero or a bad guy points a striker fired gun.  They even referred to Dennis Tueller‚Äôs classic article in SWAT Magazine that got turned into the ‚Äú21-foot rule,‚Äù which (spoilers) the gator-wrestling Crowe from Florida found out wasn‚Äôt a limitation for Raylan.    Decently-written gunfights, too.Being from the back woods, I related to this show pretty well.  When I was growing up, there were people like the supporting cast‚Äôs characters.  I have known men like Raylan Givens.  I have known, in my backwoods childhood, Mags Bennett and Dickie Bennett (who reminds me of a cousin), Mr. Limehouse,  The Brothers Crowe, Yolo, and the rest of them.  At least in archetype.

            I grew up in the country too. I saw a lot of familiar faces in the series. The Mags Bennett character reminded me of this woman down the road from where I lived growing up. I think the Crowe family lives in every downscale southern town.I laughed my ass off at the 21-foot rule part. I‚Äôve sat in carry classes where the instructor will tell people they have a right to use lethal force when an armed person is within 21-feet. In Virginia, the range exam puts the target 21-feet out. Funny how these ideas take on a life of their own.

            Quite true. Hollywood seems to think striker-fired pistols have invisible hammers that exist for the sole purpose of allowing the operator to convey sincerity. Good guy points the gun at bad guys temple, bad guy doesn‚Äôt give a shit. Good guy ‚Äúcocks‚Äù his Glock, bad guy shits his pants and spills the beans on his boss‚Äôs whereabouts. Amazing doohickey, that invisible hammer.Another thing that gets me (although it‚Äôs gotten better) is how badly TV guns rattle when waived around. Apparently handling a firearm is supposed to sound like you‚Äôre digging around in your silverware drawer. Ummmm, dude, I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs something wrong with your gun. Seriously, put that thing down before you blow your hand off.

        Leonard‚Äôs writing was as good as it gets. Here he talks about Justified:

Here he is on writing:

        I‚Äôve never lived ‚Äúcountry‚Äù but when I first encountered the show Justified, I found it fresh, interesting, and bold in a politically correct time when we are told to leave things to the justice system and we can‚Äôt defend ourselves.  It really doesn‚Äôt matter that the people are country because no matter the setting you find the same attitudes everywhere.  Just look at what is going on with the DNC shake up.  They, the leadership, won‚Äôt take responsibility.  Now it is about failed computer security and Putin messing around in US elections (a little payback for what Hillary did to him?) not about a rigged system of ego maniacs.Usually pretty clear lines between right and wrong; a man willing to do the right thing and help those in need and take down the bad guys; even resist dumb-ass higher ups and TPTB.  He is smart and picks his battles and isn‚Äôt afraid to get dirty.  He is justified in his actions, does not hesitate, and delivers swiftly, and deadly when necessary.  Yes, Rayland Givens walks tall, speaks softly and carries a big stick and isn‚Äôt afraid to use it.The 21 foot rule is just another example of what bureaucrats and administrators will latch on to in determining ROE for the people on the front lines when they, in fact, do not have their ass on the line.  They can afford to be politically correct.  They do no understand the realities on the ground either for police or the military, or the regular citizen (oh! we can‚Äôt have violence! violence is bad!).  And they won‚Äôt for the most part even make the effort to try to understand.

        Elmore was a Western writer writing updated Westerns. His good guys often had much in common with his bad guys which also made all his characters more interesting.

            Never having read the book, I‚Äôm left to guess how Elmore wrote the main characters. My guess is he intended for them to be a mirror of one another, a sort of ying-yang deal. Two men loyal to what they are as men, but the exact opposite of one another.

        For what it‚Äôs worth one of my kids took a liking to old westerns and war movies.  American Grit so to speak.  As I did, he liked John Wayne, Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood‚Ä¶  Rawhide, The Rifleman, The Dirty Dozen, Kelly‚Äôs Heroes, Bonanza‚Ä¶
I‚Äôll never forget out all the kids in his elementary classes about ten year ago, he was the only one that knew who John Wayne was.  We feminize our boys today.  Make them soft and in touch with their feelings.  They don‚Äôt know struggle.

        Once they have us all convinced we‚Äôre mentally ill, it‚Äôll be easier to medicate us all.
You know I once almost got kicked off a group blog for daring to suggest that maybe the problem with Arabs was selfish genes promoting tribalism and inbreeding. I also speculated that possibly fighting them wasn‚Äôt going to fix the problem and that maybe the only solution short of genocide was to medicate them all.  Thanks for providing a place where we can discuss mokita.

        As pointed out already, Justified came originally from Elmore Leonard, and he wrote damn good stories with believable people in tough situations. I loved Justified but couldn‚Äôt get anyone else in the family to see it was way better than most of the competition, but even so I found it waning from about series four. Never saw it to its series conclusion though.I wasn‚Äôt impressed with Sons of Anarchy from what I saw and while Breaking Bad was intelligent, clever and even plausible, the last few episodes had the same issues of ‚Äòrunning out of ideas and we gotta tie this thing up‚Äô came into view.If you want to see a series disintegrate then the West Wing is an admirable example. At first it was startlingly good but later on the absence of writer Sorkin and producer Schlamme became all too evident. In the end I doubt anyone cared what happened to any of the main characters.But that‚Äôs TV. Most series appear to have a shorter life than they imagine (or sign up for) and I can point to all sorts of series that floundered or ‚Äòlost the plot‚Äô after few seasons. So it goes‚Ä¶

            That‚Äôs the thing. TV and movies are not art so you have to expect problems. Breaking Bad‚Äôs last season could have been a few episodes, but it felt like they stretched it out to fill the season. Sons of Anarchy was pretty good for the first season, but you needed to stick it out through the first half dozen episodes. I was about to call it quits midway through and then I got hooked. But then it got weird at some point and then it got silly.I read somewhere that the cable operators are getting smart and planning the end of these things from the start so as to avoid the drift. Part of the initial pitch has to include how it ends.

                They mitigate this by splitting up last seasons, like they did with Breaking Bad and Mad Men, turning the last 16 episode season into smaller, 2√ó8 episode seasons, the final two upcoming Game of Thrones seasons will also only be 7 and 6 episodes respectively, apparently George R.R.

                Thanks Karl. Vikings is very good, but I slightly prefer the lunatic Vikes in Bernard Cornwell‚Äôs The Last Kingdom. But then, I am English and tend to look on them danish invaders as less than perfect. But I have to say, if I ever needed a shield maiden at my side then Katherine Winnick gets my vote!

                        Drake: I would agree except that there were warrior women in olden times ‚Äî okay, maybe not nuns as such ‚Äî but Boudicca was one of them. We also have to accept that TV, like books and movies and even stage plays, have to bow to the current political climate. Right now we have to say women are the equal of men in all things, so therefore all battles can be won with women. It isn‚Äôt quite true, but just like TV ads etc have to show happy mixed race families, it is just what is expected today.Mind you, if Last Kingdom and Vikings have one thing going for them, it is there aren‚Äôt any migrants pretending to be Brits or Danes. I am sure both the Fjords and Wessex were full of black people, but so far haven‚Äôt seen any. Not yet‚Ä¶

        I think I warned you that ‚ÄúJustified‚Äù was damn good teevee.
Just binge watched it again myself because nothing else current holds a candle to it.
My favorite character was the perennial f^%k-up bad guy Dewey Crowe, whose character was played by Australian actor Damn Harriman.
The bit where they tricked him into thinking other bad guys stole his kidneys had me in stitches.
The series also had some of the hottest women that have ever lived.

        way,  way off topic here‚Äî‚Äî-but did i see Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings doing the DNC roll call?
Wasn‚Äôt she exposed as completely incompetent and fathoms over her head during Freddie Gray‚Ä¶..being hustled off stage by her handlers and all?
I understand the idiots in Baltimore voting for her‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but do TPTB at the DNC think it wise to trot this post turtle out for national viewing?  Are they insane?

        Agree regarding tying up the season. Just perfect.It‚Äôs not always 1 season-worth of ideas. In the case of Supernatural (highly recommended, btw), they originally planned a 5 season arc, which would have had the perfect ending‚Ä¶then continued and had to ‚Äúresurrect‚Äù one of the main characters.

And go with the 2012 Vegas TV series next, as it‚Äôs only one season where they tie things up nicely.

                Don‚Äôt you get tired of that.  Always some Aussie or Brit instead of an American.  Nothing wrong with a little variety, but all the time?  Come on!  Even in American War movies.  I think American Sniper‚Äôs Bradley Cooper is one of the few to get a lead role instead of people like Gerard Butler being Secret Service protecting the US President.  Stuff like that.  Good actor ‚Ä¶ good movie but still.

                    @ LetsPlay ‚Äì I always thought it was odd that non-American actors played major roles in ‚ÄúThe Patriot‚Äù (Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger) and ‚ÄúBand of Brothers‚Äù (Damian Lewis, Shane Taylor) given their significance in American history. But still, great shows. I have to make a point to visit Major Winter‚Äôs memorial in Sainte-Marie-du-Mont next time I visit Normandy.

                        I have to believe it is part and parcel of the Hollywood bow to socialism in Europe.  They cannot promote anything manly, virtuous, or American by using Americans because the historical topic is more than enough.  It‚Äôs kind of a backhanded slap at America‚Äôs ‚Äúexceptionalism.‚Äù  I‚Äôm sure if people like Spielberg were interested they could make it happen.  But of course, nothing.
