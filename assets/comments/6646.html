            I‚Äôm trying to remember the speed of the first modem I encountered. It all sort of runs together after all these years. I remember the Hayes smartmodem because it was like someone handing me a ray gun or a warp drive. It felt like a huge leap forward. You and I probably in the same age range so saw the birth and death of the modem as a home appliance. Similarly, we saw the birth and death of the Fax machine.

                As a Telecom Engineer I HAD a working dial-up modem in the house (and two landlines) until I was laid off.  Most of the big systems still had land lines connected for maintenance access.I had to have a library of modem programming manuals for the different variants of smartmodem commands.  And somewhere in the basement there is a standalone fax machine.I may be a bit older, my first modem was a 300 baud acoustic coupler, remember that?  At school the ‚Äòcomputer lab‚Äô sole piece of hardware was a 110 baud printing terminal on a time share line.  We were learning FORTRAN,  Now, I remember about as much of that as I do French.

                CB too. It started to show up in newspaper articles in the late ‚Äô40s, but I don‚Äôt recall it amounting to much until the ‚Äô60s or ‚Äô70s. Never hear of it now.

                    Driving cross country in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs there was constant talk on the CB.  When I drove truck for 10 years in the 2000‚Äôs  all I used the CB for was to talk to the load out operator at the grain elevator to spot my trailers, drive 400 hundred miles of US 395 and I 84 never here a thing on the CB.

            First modem was a Hayes 300, bought from a guy up the street who was upgrading to 1200 baud. Ran it off an AT clone, which had replaced a Televideo TS1603 that had set me back 2 or 3 grand, I can‚Äôt remember exactly.

                CompuServe‚Ä¶I remember having a CompuServe account for a few years, only used it for internet email though. But one day our internal company email was connected to the internet, and that was that. You couldn‚Äôt pick your own username, instead you were assigned an eight-digit numerical username‚Ä¶making it annoying for you and impossible for your friends to remember. Good times.

                    ‚ÄúTheZman‚Äù is the result of those early days when the system assigned a user name. I kept getting that username and it became a bit of joke with friends. I was always zman123 or thezman123 and so on. I registered the domain twenty years ago as a gag and here it is, a world wide brand!

        Now that you are on a blogroll update frenzyi nominate James LaFond to be added as well:http://www.jameslafond.com/He is a blogger/book author/boxer living in Baltimore and reporting from the ghetto front lines.While you Z are reporting from the edges, LaFond is in the belly of the beast‚Ä¶His site is updated daily with gems like ‚ÄúThe grim fate of the wise shaman is the very reason why I have elected to remain a fool!‚Äù, ‚ÄúA society on the incline emulates the upper class, a society on the decline emulates the lower class.‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt is a brutal thing; the suffering of the man who has been denied a test of his merits or a rite of passage; the suffering that no primitive society‚Äîno matter how cruel and dedicated to the torture, and even the eating, of its enemies‚Äîwould ever consider inflicting on one of its own.‚Äù or ‚ÄúAs a reluctant slave, myself, I rue our now comprehensive form of enslavement to the system. It occurs to me, that our massive slave society‚Äîso loved and promoted with rabid eagerness by most women and blacks‚Äîis, in fact, a form of mean-spirited vengeance, a way of the natural slave‚Äînever better exemplified then by a feminist woman‚Äîto make sure that the would-be Aristotle‚Äôs among us are chained right beside them.‚ÄùEven historical bits of wisdom, i didn‚Äôt know about the Powhatan Uprising ‚ÄúIn which white runaways banded together with Indians to wipe out the plantations in 1622-23, coming close to success. The war that crowns this period, Bacon‚Äôs Rebellion in 1676, in which white renegades, white slaves, and black slaves, allied against colonial officials, the plantation owners, Indian tribes and even pirates, in a knock down drag out fight which resulted in the burning of Jamestown, also came close to victory for the rebels.‚ÄùOrfun factsabout slavery, such as ‚ÄúBlack slaves would be sought directly from Africa, so that there lack of English language ability‚Äîand ability to understand one another‚Äôs tribal languages‚Äîmight prevent their conspiring with each other and white slaves to turn on their mutual oppressors.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs pure gold, well worth linking to.I always read The Z Blog and LaFond in tandem‚Ä¶

        One of the issues is speed of download, and therefore speed of upload. The more you give people swift access (in olden times, one had to go home, close the door and fire up one‚Äôs computer: now the serf can do it on the move from some handheld device) the more you want them to do it faster in their oh so busy lives. The 140 character limit in Twatter is essentially to allow people to sound off quickly, and therefore without much forethought.Now if tinterwebz had a a built in treacle pit to slow down the urge to immediately respond, then there might be a lot more careful consideration of responses and examination of thoughts, but everyone wants it fast now. Fast is quick and angry and stupid.On the other hand, when I taught I had ‚Äòstudents‚Äô who, sat next to each other in class, would be texting each other. When asked, one of them said how else was he going to use his 600 free minutes of texting each month?

        I somehow doubt it‚Äôs ‚Äòthe end of twitter‚Äô because a lot of the stuff on twitter has nothing to do with right wing politics.Still, it‚Äôs interesting to ponder how someone like Anita Sarkeesian was able to get this job. She‚Äôs one of the chief troublemakers, accusing people of not being devout enough to the Cause. It‚Äôs precisely because she‚Äôs a lunatic from the fringe that she got this job. When we ask how it is that cuckoo jihadist-mongers get to dictate Muslim society‚Äôs views, it‚Äôs for the same reason that Miss Sarkeesian was able to get this new job of hers.That‚Äôs worth thinking about.

            The joke is that Sarkeesian may or may not actually give a rats ass about the political stuff. Before she became a professional feminist, she was working with some pick up artist guy ‚Äî the rip-off artist type. The Feminist Frequency videos were all written by some male feminist dude who got her onboard as a mouthpiece. He was the brains of the operation.She‚Äôs a more or less sociopathic self promoter, I think. She may or may not believe much of anything at all, though I‚Äôm quite sure she‚Äôs sincerely vindictive towards anybody who points out what a piece of crap she is.That‚Äôs the kind of personality that leftism promotes.

            Just because something is huge and seemingly ubiquitous on the internet, doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt go away within a year. Remember when Yahoo was ‚ÄúTHE‚Äù way to find things on the internet? For a long time, it wasn‚Äôt even a search engine, it was a centrally-managed directory! Then google appeared in 1998 and within a year blew yahoo‚Äôs directory and search engine off the map. Similarly, anyone remember MySpace? Facebook was the same idea, but far better implemented and six months after it was launched, MySpace took a dirt nap.Twitter will be huge unless someone else comes along with something similar, but better. Then, it will vanish as if it never even existed.

The term of art is ‚ÄúWatsoned.‚Äù¬†Now, the social¬†media giants are ‚Äúdisappearing‚Äù people for violating the new religion, by banning their accounts. Robert Stacy McCain is the most recent example. [‚Ä¶]

        To be honest I don‚Äôt use Twitter. In fact, I don‚Äôt even own a smart-phone. I had to look it up to fully appreciate what Twitter is all about. But this statement from Wikipedia about Twitter is a prophetic description of the entire concept:
‚Äú‚Ä¶we came across the word ‚Äòtwitter‚Äô, and it was just perfect. The definition was ‚Äòa short burst of inconsequential information,‚Äô and ‚Äòchirps from birds‚Äô. And that‚Äôs exactly what the product was.‚Äù
Seems the product, and most of the content are exactly that‚Ä¶inconsequential. Sort of like Pet Rocks.

        Twitter is over, but it will be awhile before they realize it. The echo chamber of their fellow travelers will hide the evidence of their totalitarianism until a viable competitor usurps them.
I am unfamiliar with the ‚Äútwo women in a kitchen‚Äù thing. Throughout my life there have been countless occasions where I‚Äôve been working in the kitchen with at least one other woman and sometimes more,  with no problems. Are you confusing this with ‚Äúthere can only be one Queen to a castle‚Äù? Which is completely true.

            My mother and her sisters had fierce battles over who controlled the kitchen. The outcome was always that one backed down, but it was hairy for a while. The food was always good. This goes back a while, so maybe it‚Äôs not a reference that means much anymore. Or maybe it was specific to my Italian-American family.

                It all depends on the women and the kitchen. In my experience this is often true.
