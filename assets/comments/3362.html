        People don’t like being repeatedly confronted by confusing choices, but that’s a hump you have to get over just once in many cases. The McDonald’s menu is large, but after parsing it the first time you see it you can just come back and order the same thing you had before, with minor variations. It’s what I do and I suspect many others.“It is the great lie of modern times that people like options. That’s nonsense”No, options ARE good, because even though people are creatures of habit, they’re all very different creatures. It’s everything on the Mickey D’s menu you don’t want that makes it annoying. But you don’t want what other people want.

        re: McDonaldsRarely have had their fare over the years. However, on Thanksgiving day fate struck and I visited one.My wife and I were invited to a friend’s home for Thanksgiving dinner. They live on an island that one has to get there by ferry and the wait for the ferry usually is more than an hour at best as it is so popular on holidays. Well I picked my wife up from church along with a relative of the family we would be visiting. Since both of the passengers were traditional Catholics they were still fasting as they had Holy Communion when I picked them up. We had to get to the ferry ASAP but they were hungry. Well instead of taking the interstate I drove the state route with all of the strip malls, restaurants, car dealers, etc. hoping to find a fast food joint for breakfast. After miles of driving past closed eating establishments including a few McDonalds I spotted a McDonalds that was open and its lot filled with cars. I pulled in and we went inside for a fast breakfast. Each of us ordered a breakfast sandwich and a hot drink. No one got a “meal” and I payed. The bill came to just south of $25.00–WTF!!! My two guests had one egg McMuffin each and I had some thing called a bacon biscuit, I think. The two passengers had Lattes and I had White Chocolate Cocoa.As we were in such a hurry, I did not want to waste time finding out where all the money went so I just paid. We ate and I showed the receipt to my wife and she checked the costs which he considered to be insane and said that we should have waited to eat on the Ferry but was glad to have eaten before the long wait at the terminal. Our wait was well over an hour and when we finally got on we were among the last few cars let on the large vessel. i can’t imagine the delay had we not rushed.Perhaps McDonalds is pricing themselves out of range for most people. If I am about to spend $25.00 for breakfast I would not consider McDonalds at the price it just cost me considering what abysmal food that they sold.Dan Kurtp.s The Thanksgiving Turkey was a bust. A son-in-law volunteered to cook the two turkeys by deep frying. To avoid a family spat the hostess said yes. Want to eat RUBBER turkey? Deep fry it. Want to ruin a grass lawn? Fry a turkey (or Two) on it and one stands a good chance to wreck a ten foot in diameter radius from spilled peanut oil at 350° F. For Christmas I am planning to SLOW COOK at 190° F for 8 hours a turkey breast. That method is fool proof and one gets wonderful drippings for gravy.

        Campesino – you are right. In-N-Out’s food is never frozen because they will not open a restaurant more than one day’s drive from their headquarters in LA. If they can’t get it there in one day, they won’t do it.

        Diversity analogy aside, you must admit that the McRib is a little piece of accounting genius.  Limit supply, let demand get pent up, then when you need a quick cash injection — say, when approaching time to announce a weaker-than-expected quarterly — you drop a McRib bomb to your bottom line.
Personally, I find the things disgusting.  My wife, however, gobbles them by the bagful.  Or at least she does when not riding on one of the periodic diet fadwagons, as she is currently.  Double Quarter Pounders, though…  I’ll put a dent in their population.

        In N Out has a good product.
Their other selling point is that nothing is ever frozen, all ingredients are fresh. You can watch them cutting the potatoes for french fries in their kitchen.

        It’s been my experience that when restaurants’ menus get too big the quality declines- I also thing it applies to more outlets. I’m old enough to remember when going to McDonald’s was a treat! Not anymore!

        the reason is simple: mcdonals couldn’t get the revenue they have now just selling a dozen items . If they can sell a salad for $3 and it costs then $.1 to make it, free money

        Lots of choice is confusing, however exciting it seems at first.
Even more depressing when you realise that a double grizzle burger is actually just a bit more grizzle than plain grizzle burger and nothing else, whatever the menu says (and accompanied by a picture of a grinning family like they have never eaten before.)

        Perhaps the multitude of options can be blamed for their less than stellar numbers lately. Lord Nose.
