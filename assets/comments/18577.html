        Conspiracy is the weed that grows when elites don’t tend the social trust garden.  It’s a symptom of elite neglect, not a virus.Hostile, uncaring or irresponsible elites prefer the virus explanation – blame the society’s diabetes and bedsores on Jones, Putin and YouTube, or our own defects.  Don’t finger the elites on permanent vacation who’ve left us to fend for ourselves in a societal group home with crumbling infrastructure staffed by barely-supervised surly Browns like the Yass-Qwainz of the DMV. And don’t notice that the worst of them want us out of the way so they can spend our estates. The elite true believers genuinely care and think Clown World Sanitorium is what’s best for us. They drop by on occasion to offer Woke inspration and sign the papers to up our medication.We gave them privileges and gave them our trust. They’ve taken the benefits and rendered no duty, no noblesse oblige.  No wonder we bother the staff with our crazy stories about how the kids don’t care or want us dead (that’s you, Kevin Williamson. Shout out to Michelle Goldberg too).We may not know all the facts on the ground and we may be jumping at shadows now and again.  But that doesn’t mean they’re not trying to kill, plunder, replace or simply blue-pill us so they can enjoy our stolen futures.

            I highly recommend giving this recent long interview between the ‘Financial Times’ and Putin a close read:“What is happening in the West? What is the reason for the Trump phenomenon, as you said, in the United States? What is happening in Europe as well? The ruling elites have broken away from the people. The obvious problem is the gap between the interests of the elites and the overwhelming majority of the people.”“There is also the so-called liberal idea, which has outlived its purpose. Our Western partners have admitted that some elements of the liberal idea, such as multiculturalism, are no longer tenable.”“As for the liberal idea, its proponents are not doing anything. They say that all is well, that everything is as it should be. But is it? They are sitting in their cosy offices, while those who are facing the problem every day in Texas or Florida are not happy, they will soon have problems of their own. Does anyone think about them?“The same is happening in Europe. I discussed this with many of my colleagues, but nobody has the answer. The say they cannot pursue a hard-line policy for various reasons. Why exactly? Just because. We have the law, they say. Well, then change the law!”“In other words, the situation is not simple in Russia either, but we have started working to improve it. Whereas the liberal idea presupposes that nothing needs to be done. The migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants must be protected. What rights are these? Every crime must have its punishment.“So, the liberal idea has become obsolete. It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population. Or take the traditional values. I am not trying to insult anyone, because we have been condemned for our alleged homophobia as it is. But we have no problems with LGBT persons. God forbid, let them live as they wish. But some things do appear excessive to us.“They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles. I cannot even say exactly what genders these are, I have no notion. Let everyone be happy, we have no problem with that. But this must not be allowed to overshadow the culture, traditions and traditional family values of millions of people making up the core population.”http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/60836Putin is actually acknowledging the obvious problems, therefore he is a problem to the Western elite class, and must be taken down by any measure.  One measure is an elite class hatched, and endlessly propagandized to the rubes, “conspiracy theory,” that Putin manipulated Trump voters into glancing out of the cave and into the light.

                To clarify, Murrica and its allies vs. Russia and its allies is not just an ideological struggle, it is a geopolitical struggle, between opposing bands of elites.  The Murrica Empire aggressively seeks to wholly control the world, its elites want a cultureless open world plutocrat plantation to rule over forever.  Geopolitics is vital, especially under modern economic  conditions.  A country needs a very large and cohesive mutual defense and trading bloc to access the resources necessary to defend itself, and to develop its economy sufficiently to provide its population a modern material existence (which is vital to keep its population from becoming infected with the liberal Empire’s ideas).  Narrow nationalism does not work anymore, as even very large and developed countries can be slowly taken down by the liberal Empire, and absorbed into itself (think of the Kurt Russell movie ‘The Thing’).

                Russia has also not inflated its economy through significant credit creation at the central bank level.  Their standard of living may be “subpar” and not growing very fast, but their economy is also fairly well insulated from external credit market shocks.  The trade impediments placed in their way have also created a situation where they are much less trade dependent than most western economies, and their self-sufficiency on most things (partly due to a not particularly vigorous level of demand) is a virtuous by-product of their situation.

        It certainly appears that Obama/Clinton cabal will skate, but at the cost of destroying all trust in federal government institutions.  Even a mainstream politician like Ted Cruz is openly talking about the Deep State conspiring to save the Iran deal.

        I’ve casually looked into a lot of the conspiracy theories over the years, and while I don’t claim to know the true story of what exactly happened in all of them, one thing I do know is I don’t trust the official story.  I also only believe in coincidences up to a certain point.

        In time of war, and while on the battlefield, situational awareness is a vital survival skill. Think of it as being persistently hyper-alert for potential threats. We are descended from the survivors of an environment in which existential threat was routine and our proclivity for situational awareness is a trait that has been passed down to us by these ancient survivors. In the modern age of civilization, tangible existential threats are shrinking in number and severity, and fear is being replaced with anxiety. Conspiracy Theory skepticism is just the modern incarnation of our ancestral proclivity for situational awareness.

            Situational awareness means seeing something that * could be * a threat – and making an evaluation based on incomplete information.It’s not like the tiger that is hiding behind a tree ready to pounce on you – is going to announce his presence.  You’re going to have to pick up clues.  Some tracks in the mud that disappear behind a tree.  The fact that the jungle is eerily quiet in the area you’re in.The guy who is semi-situationally aware – is going to read a few clues and  say there’s a tiger behind that tree.  He might actually get it wrong a number of times.  If he continues to pay attention – sooner or later he’s going to get pretty good a predicting whether there is a lion behind a tree with 80% confidence.  That is unless the rest of the members of his tribe constantly scream “Tinfoil!!” at him every time he was incorrect.Then he’s probably going to give up after a while and just people get eaten.

                Sometimes the warning feedback is very subtle and below the threshold of immediate awareness, such as the hairs standing up on the back of your neck unconsciously. This is the hindbrain (amygdala) speaking to you indirectly.

        One quibble Z.  Alex Jones has been ranting about child sex abuse at Epstein’s private island since the early 2000’s at least (he was on it when he was just an Austin public access TV guy).  And he’s been on the videotaping powerful people for blackmail line from the start as well.

        Conspiracy theories are only fun if there’s plenty of doubt involved.  We “know” Russia-gate was a hoax.  We “know” about the  deep  state war on Trump.  We “know ” why Epstein had to die. Those aren’t any fun and might just get you disappeared for asking questions.  TPTB don’t care about aliens or batboy or man-bear-pig so those are safe and whacky enough to have some fun with.

            The lack of interest in the Epstein story is a puzzler. This was a guy planning to have his head frozen, so it could be thawed out in the future when they learned ho to do head transplants. That’s not a guy wishing for death.
Maybe it takes time for these things to develop. Twenty years from now Hollywood will be doing movies based on Epstein conspiracy theories, like the JFK stuff.

                    Correct.  Corporate Media decide what is a conspiracy theory and what isn’t.   As they used to say on conspiracy TV’s  “X Files,” the “truth is out there.”
We the people are nothing but mushrooms, fed shit and kept in the dark.  All we have, all we will ever have, are “conspiracy theories.”

                        The corporate acquisition of major media outlets (and their subsidiaries) in the ’80s  ensured the masses would never be confronted with “bad think” . . . until the widespread adoption of the internet.   And  freedom of speech on the internet is under attack now.

                    Stephen Paddock is truly one for the ages. The worst mass murder in American history and no clear motive. In the most surveilled city in America, no footage of the attack or its planning.

                        My guess is that it was an incel rampage. No children, poor social skills, ugly old Filipina girlfriend, and he targets a crowd of attractive young Chads and Stacies having a good time.
It’s hard to write an incel manifesto without sounding like a whiny little faggot, and Paddock was not especially eloquent, so he didn’t bother.
In a normal society, any guy able to afford all those weapons would have regular access to young pussy, which really soothes the rage.

                            That’s certainly plausible. Rage-gunning motherfuckers is a very Modernist impulse as most memorably expressed by Z-man’s previous Avataar, HL Mencken:“Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats.”That being said, there should be little difficulty demonstrating the above and using such motive to further denigrate, demean, and dispossess hwhyte men.The fact of the matter is that two years from that fateful date, we know as much (or little) about this incident as we knew on that date.Likewise with Epstein, to date, there isn’t one satisfactory account of this motherfucker’s life and times and how he got all this moolah for all this stuff. And who the fuck has the chutzpah to whack a mook like him in federal custody under the nose of the world?In re: Russiagate; an outright slow motion coup d’etat is being buried in broad daylight.9/11, we admitted more Muzzies in the decade following 9/11 than the four hundred years preceding that event.My white friends, please, please explain this to your colored interlocutor? Perhaps, your ways are too subtle and too sharp for me to grok? Truly, I am dumbfounded by….everything.

                        Another conspiracy The Range buys into:Stephen Paddock massacre of 10/1/17 has indeed been pushed under the bloody carpet.  Does anybody out there remember immediately after the massacre, the first media appearance of the Clark Co. Sheriff he stated to paraphrase that they have evidence of terrorism, the sheriff was positive and animated and sure.  Very shortly after, he returned to the media and dropped the terrorism meme, can’t find any reference online, the body language of the sheriff was quite subdued and he looked like he’d been hit by a spanner. So started the solo madman meme. Then the sherriff on 10/4 stated: “You’ve got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point.” Then that dropped and back to the solo meme.  As all this was rolling, multiple people at the concert claimed to see a second shooter roaming through the concert shooting. Not to mention a crazy Casandra roaming through the concert and hour before the shooting began warning they were all going to F***ing die.And ISIS claimed:  “Responding to the call of [Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi] to target the states of the Crusader alliance, and after careful observation of gatherings of the Crusaders in the US city of Las Vegas, one of the soldiers of the caliphate (Abu Abd al-Bar al-Amriki, may Allah accept him) lay hidden armed with machine guns and various ammunition in a hotel overlooking a concert,” it said.“He opened fire on their gathering, leaving 600 killed and injured, until his ammunition was finished and he departed as a martyr.”August 2018 the sanitized final report was released. Then the entire killing spree got buried.

                            All of that can easily be explained.There was never evidence of “terrorism”, LVPD were simply speculating about possibilities. Same thing with a second gunman.In the aftermath of disasters people often report odd occurrences like somebody trying to warn everyone else of danger, etc. That’s a coping mechanism for the survivors.As for ISIS, they have falsely claimed responsibility for many mass killings in the west for propaganda reasons.  Besides, shootings aren’t really Abdul’s style, he’d rather blow something up because it’s more intimidating.Vegas was unfortunately what it looked like; a mentally ill old man killed a lot of innocent people for no reason in a town that doesn’t take anything seriously except entertainment.

                Within 5 years Hollywood will make a movie about how Trump murdered Epstein b/c Putin and the Chinese.  Jones is already claiming the PRC did it.  He’s one case where I’m not sure the old joke about Jewish divorce applies.  Was it really worth it, Alex?

                Said this before, but the weird part about Epstein is that as a guy supposedly running billions, he left virtually no footprints other than custody over some cash accounts.  That is really, really hard to do.  Somebody has to clear and the custodial accounts have to be somewhere…yet no one I know at the major institutions here knew.  Pretty weird.

                Talking about Epstein is close enough to talking about the JQ (or the Zionist Q) that harping on it for too long is liable to get you censored from youtube or excluded from polite society.So the only people following it where it leads are somewhat marginal people with little to lose, even if they’re not explicitly WN.generic civnat Stranahan will follow it where it leads, but he works for Russia.Regular conservatives are paid NOT to follow it where it leads. They wouldn’t have jobs if they followed things where they lead.So who exactly is supposed to be talking about Epstein?

                    Too far to travel from where he lived in Coney Island. Way too far. In any case, Jews aren’t prestige junkies like the Orientals. Lloyd Blankfein, same vintage, also went to a neighborhood school. And Blankfein is genuinely smart. Nobody would disagree about that.

                I DO understand the lack of prosecutions (too many guilty parties).  I DON’T understand the lack of interest.   Sex, the hated wealthy, class divides, blackmail pictures, an international angle, cover-ups…it’s tailor made for non-stop tabloid gossip.
It’s really a testament to just how myopic persons in “our thing” really are?  Makes me think that there’s some serious “bubble think” among the Moldbugs, the Zmen, the Derbyshire-ites, et all.  (of which I’m 100% one of, and proudly)
It’s an odd thing, as the Zman states.

                It’s almost as if the people who wanted him dead learned a lesson from JFK.  Epstein apparently walked right into it at Teterboro. Getting Epstein to MCC and counting on the prisoners to do what they typically do to women/child abusers left a relatively clean narrative. Arranging a little unsupervised time was certainly much less complicated than having to involve any Ruby type intermediate.

        The best way to hide skulduggery is to hide it in plain sight.  Make everything seem convoluted and corrupted and soon most people just take the rot for granted.  They move on, they have their own problems to deal with. This gives the vermin a free hand to do pretty much whatever they want as long as they don’t jump the shark.

        “This suggests a couple of things about the sorts of people who become obsessed with conspiracy theories. One is they like the leaps of logic required to tie the various facts together in the narrative. …The other thing about the conspiracy people is they eschew certainty. The typical conspiracy theory has lots of ambiguity and uncertainty.”Funny how folks searching for “explanations” of why people “believe in conspiracies” seem to like complicated explanations. “Leaps of logic” and “eschew certainty” indeed.Occam’s Razor: “conspiracy theorists” know physics.

            Anyone inclined to rubbish the Dancing Shlomos story should check out Dawson’s stuff before drawing conclusions.I’ve been convinced. There’s no need to micro-scrutinize beard-hairs and the overall narrative is logical, not crankish in any way.  These guys were questioned, said what they said, the networks of fishy “moving companies” were real, and whatever this network was for, it clearly has Mossad’s fingerprints all over it.  The evidence reported by the authorities themselves supports all of that without any whiff of “conspiracy theorizing” or “Trutherism.”There’s historical precedent with the way Britain employed disinformation and other shenanigans to draw the US into the world wars. Israel had strong interests in drawing already-sympathetic America fully on-side in their ongoing conflicts with the Arabs and Persians, arguably existential interests, just as Britain did.Even without going all-in with Dawson’s false flag theory, it’s enough to say that at least Mossad had eyes on the hijackers, knew of their plans and sat on the intel because American terrorist casualties would cement our alliance and launch the War on Terror.

                My theory:  most of the hijackers were Saudi, correct?  9/11was a joint operation on the part of Saudi elite and mossad, facilitated by these on American soil, hence the elaborate surrounding and surveillance of the hijackers in the US, as detailed in Justin raimondo’s book.  Bin laden actually denied responsibility, but accepted it for other things, so we can assume he’s truthful.  The hijackers themselves were useful idiots, who believed they were doing what they were doing.

        I personally believe the concept, and especially the extremely negative oddball connotations, of conspiracy theories were introduced by the intelligence services. Why not, a tool to socially ostracize those who ask too many questions. That’s a gold standard in camouflage. So there’s a conspiracy theory to explain conspiracy theories lol

        Seems that conspiracies like the extant ones in Washington are more things that people fell into and once in kept digging the hole deeper.  What started as a brownie point exercise spying on Trump to prove worthiness to the incoming Queen suddenly transformed into an “oh shit” exercise that just dug the hole deeper.  But playing for time may yet bail them out with a regime change in 2020 .  Hillary was a cunt’s hair away from pulling it off with her email bungle.  That strategy always worked for the Clintons so it was a good bet it would work again.BTW that was a slow week in Nantucket real estate.  What’s fun is that the real ownership is generally hidden behind LLCs and trusts.  That’s what all the $0 transfers are about.  But if you have the old paper phone book there you can ring up Chris Matthews on New South Rd and give him and earful if you feel like it.  Or the Soros family.

        People were interested in spygate at first, but once it began to be co-opted by the conservative establishment, it gradually became obvious that nothing was going to come from it, and they were going to string us along forever with it, and they were going to deploy their own forms of misinformation. Q-Anon wasn’t the only plan trusting psyop.At that point, tuning out is a very rational response. Conspiracy theories are the product of people mistrusting the establishment, after all.Justice for spygate can only come from the establishment, which means there won’t be justice for it. Indeed, they basically got the “victim” to give up on justice.Conspiracy theorists WERE interested in Epstein, and probably still are, but at this point it’s kind of obvious who he worked for (Mossad), and it’s kind of obvious what they’re doing and it’s kind of obvious what they did to him.And it’s kind of obvious that if you talk about that, even as a CivNat or libertarian, you will be punished as harshly as if you were a full on WN.(Incidentally, normies don’t argue against this when it is explained to them but they also don’t seem to change their attitudes as a result of it. Maybe they have resigned themselves to being powerless?)

            The pizzagate-Podesta thing was more interesting to me.  As long as no attention was being paid, the evidence (e-mails, the spirit dinners, the art collection, the pizza joint signage and naming) was really damning.  As soon as the light was shone on it, everyone scrambled and everything got taken down.  Epstein seems to be going the same way, everything is now being burned and scrubbed.

                I would say that Pizzagate-Podesta thing had something to it. You don’t normally have very powerful people texting each other in code speak. And the way the MSM scrubbed it once it got noticed leads me to believe it may have been a child sex ring at the center of it as pederasty is one of the last remaining taboos.Or it maybe where the all the chief blackmailers of Congress and judges meet.  We’ve all been amazed at how fast newly minted pols  turn on their base and break their promises. It’s as if they walk into a room and someone plops a folder down in front of them and says “this stuff goes public if you go against us”.For all intents it seems no one is allowed in D.C. unless the elites have leverage over them.

        The mainstream popularity of individual conspiracies have direct correlation to the progressive agenda; i.e. any genuine conspiracy that doesn’t serve their ideology is memory-holed.  A corollary, however, is that anti-progressive conspiracies pitched by dimwits and screwballs will be highlighted, and thus ignored.  Conspiracies about dissidents and AR-15 toting “hate” groups also get attention because they focus on the only conspiracy that matters right now, the conspiracy of white man putting down the brown man.  Progressives have a century of well-honed experience on misdirection and propagandizing ignorant Americans.  That’s why no one ever questions some of the old (but genuine) conspiracies like the establishment of the Federal Reserve, or America’s entry into both world wars, or the cause of the Great Depression, or early support to the Bolsheviks and Soviets.  After the “red scare” conspiracy was effectively put down by both dimwits (McCarthy) and disinformation (CIA), quickly followed by JFK and Johnson’s lying to escalate Vietnam … throw in the Israeli sinking of the USS LIBERTY for good measure … the masses have been effectively conditioned to ignore EVERYTHING of importance, which of course includes Epstein and Barr’s letting Comey off the hook.  But who cares … the NFL season is kicking off.

        For half a century those disbelieving the official story of JFK’s “Lone Assassin” were ridiculed as “conspiracy theorists”. James Corbett, of course, has the official CIA notice to the media instructing their Mockingbird Media to so decry those who doubted the Warren Report.
The Official US Government stance today?
There was a conspiracy.

            The official narrative of 9/11 is literally a conspiracy theory. All it takes is three or more persons planning something.Words just don’t have any meaning anymore. Maybe they never really did and I’m the abnormal one for thinking definitions matter. Maybe human existence is just emoting and hysteria ad infinitum.I watched the Professor and the Madman recently. Its about the making of the first English dictionary. Mel Gibson was great as always. But it made me think that the men trying to define everything were the crazy assholes. In the end they admit its a project that will never be finished. Impossible tasks with no end. Now that sounds familiar doesn’t it? If you can’t do, just do something impossible. At least you get to brag about trying and you don’t take flack for failing. Leveraging first-mover knowledge for financial gain is just a benefit.It’s like people overusing the term pedophilia (sexual attraction to children) when ephebophilia (sexual attraction to 15-19 year olds) is the correct term in most cases. Just doesn’t have the same moral condemnation though does it? Or we will just change the definition of children. Brains are maturing later donchaknow? And yet women still hit menopause at the same time lol.

                    Awesome.
I am hesitant to use the adjective because, as most of us know, its currency grew more inflated in the 1980s than ((( Weimar deutsche marks ))).
I am also hesitant to employ awesome as a descriptor because of “Awesome” Joe McCall, a YMCA Director from my hometown, who uttered the word so profusely and so indiscriminately he merited the eponymous nickname.
Nevertheless, awesome applies here.  It is the best post of the week with all due respect to Exile’s brilliant bon mots.

        We live in an age when (allegedly) everything can be explained by science. It can’t but that the general perception – “there MUST be a rational explanation”. As a society, we can no tolerate mystery or unanswered questions.But, as a species, we yearn for something “out there” that is mysterious, unexplained, supernatural even. Something tantalizing that cannot be reduced to nuts, bolts and molecules and then filed as “known and explained”. We long for the transcendent and the promise of magic. So aliens, cryptids, ghosts and monsters provide the frisson of temporary escape from an otherwise prosaic and purely mechanical world.

        My conspiracy theory re Eppie:On Monday, he was in all the news.By Friday, Ilhan Omar had done something anti-semitic, so “the world leapt to the defense of plucky Israel!”  And not another peep about the suicidal philanthropist.Guaran-dam-teed Omar and Tlaib got their itinerary and tickets straight from the Israeli embassy.  Caroline Glick, writing from Israel, had an article on how BDS (Boycott &amp; Divestment movement) is funded by NGOS… that are from Israel.How strange.  I mean, the Foreign Ministry directly funds 100 immigration resettlement NGOs here and a hundred more in the EU, but that’s an act of peace, right?The left would never be a controlled opposition plucking heartstrings, making the right passionately defend ‘our guy’ from those awful lefties… would they.

        The federal government is now just organized crime. In fact they put their competition the mafia out of business but that’s for another story.And now just like the mafia they leave their handiwork out on the street for everyone to see.it’s not a conspiracy theory . Everybody knows what happens when you go up against the mob.  So we hope they just keep continuing to kill each other and leave us alone.Perhaps the confusing thing is why they continue to try and.maintain a front of legitimacy.  Like the phony storefronts in Little Italy we all know it’s a shame but walk just a little bit faster past the storefront.

        I was told that the Rand Institute invented the term conspiracy theory back in the early sixties , probably just after the Kennedy assassination as a meme to deprecate the growing conspiracy mindsetIt was pretty effective for a while as conspiracy theory is a great meme but that is fading simply because anyone with basic logic skills would realize that the US was formed by a conspiracy against its king and that conspiracies didn’t magically disappearAlso if conspiracies weren’t common you could charge someone in court with conspiring which is a quite common chargeIts meets the rhetoric test, fails the dialectic as it wereAs to more outre conspiracies, it’s simply not possible not know what is real or not and how much of it. When multiple US military personnel come out and say “I’ve seen aliens and alien spacecraft.” there is a 100% a conspiracy afoot , either one to cover it up or one to mind screw the public or one to make money or maybe all of the aboveThe same applies to any other weird phenomenon, millions of people see strange things  and it only requires a single account of a UFO being aliens, bigfoot being real, ghost existing to shift the whole paradigmGiven the nature of society and human nature, there are lots of incentive to keep that stuff quiet if it existsI’d even  go as far as to  argue that he crazy guy ranting about zero point energy or the Freemasons has better intentions than anyone in the government even if he is probably  an utter loon. He just wants  to be believed, the, truth to be out and maybe a better worldI can’t say anyone in office has as clean a motive even if they are saner.The hell of it is that a fix is also nigh impossible. It would require honesty for decades on end to build a foundation of trust with swift and serious punishment for liarsMaybe an ideological motivated Right Wing dictatorship could manage it, caveat Christianity munging things up but the current system?Don’t make me laugh, Too much money, status, power and too many secrets at stake for the truth however mundane to be anything but a casualtyThis is course speeds up the collapse but what can anyone do?

            To Moran’s point above, we could get an airtight explanation of something going on, for example, Alzaebo’s NGO thing, and it still wouldn’t matter, IMO.  We have been so twisted around the axle over the years, about so many things, that one simply gets numb to it all after a while.  Moran may be right, that might be part of the game.  Interesting (to me, anyway), that freedom of the airwaves and the opening up of the internet has changed the conversation, but not for much constructive purpose, at least so far.  We know more about the games played, and more details of the evidence and the false flags, but what can be done about it all appears more elusive than ever.

                The main  solution for conspiracies is to lock up or execute known or suspected members just like the FBI did to the Mafia back in the day though with less limitationsMost revolutionary governments end up doing this since people who benefited from the last set up even if defeated tend to linger around causing trouble . Trump while hardly a revolutionary has had a passel of this alreadyEven a Right wing system will basically have to deal harshly with subversion and counter revolutionary activity.The secondary solution is to exclude anyone you don’t trust from your society. This means a lot of small, crabed heavily armed societies since we live in a world with pervasive conspiracies . Everyone gets to be Bulgaria or North Korea for a while.In the distant past , after the Bronze Age Collapse and during a good chunk of the migration era this was the norm. I don’t know you? It will take massive effort for me to trust you ever.This is probably how it will go down given the levels of trust in the US which still has some rule of law are declining so fast.

        Conspiracies arise naturally when people think the official narrate is a lie.
There is nothing odd or wrong with conspiracies per se
The Holy Trinity is, obviously, a conspiration but the government has propagandised people to think that al conspiracies are negative/insane.

        The king of conspiracy theories is the JFK assassination. That thing just won’t quit. Even when you point out the absurdity of Earl Warren being allied with radical right wingers, or the idea that LBJ did it undetected, they keep at it. Any plausible connection works for these loons.

            Epstein will likely end up another JFK story – we know the official explanation is bullshit, too many holes, too much smoke for no fire, but none of the hundred alternatives will be provable. Wild card – someone squeals. Like the 2nd-3rd gen mobsters who ratted to Juliani, they don’t make Deep State stooges like they used to.

            The missing frames in the Zapruder film are the tell. The fatal shot was from the shadows in a storm gutter as there was a pre-planned marker the driver was instructed to stop at. That’s why the wound exited up and to the back of the head.Seems to me JFK was a revenge hit as the guy seemed to betray those who put him in power. Boomers seem brainwashed about him; the guy was an anxious drug-addict who fed the MIC and was played by multiple women. That being said I hope the redhead grandson is sympathetic to our cause and enters politics. Looks like he could be a leader.Redheads are the most endangered European racial branch and I think have the most Neanderthal DNA.

        There have always been conspiracies.  And theories about them.  One could be forgiven for imagining that with the invention of the printing press (and its modern-day equivalent)  the availability of information would either dispel or confirm these theories.   Instead  corporate entities bought up and consolidated the media in the ’80s  and now the Alphabets and their cohorts are the censors.

        People tend to be zero conspiracy or one conspiracy people. They believe everything is more or less on the up and up, or that everything is run by a cabal of Jews or Lizards or Grays or Breakfast Prayer People.Somewhat recently, I was reading the right wing papers and a certain conspiracy was brought up. My thought was, “Hey, I know that guy.” The comfort of a mono-conspiracy is that everything becomes part of one grand meaningful plan. But there are many things which go bump in the night. The Empire is lousy with court intrigues and frenetic schemings. Things like the JQ give life meaning (we will defeat the hidden rulers), while real conspiracies like Epstein are just another political plot (though probably a very, very important one).

            For some conspiracy giggles, check out ‘To the Stars Academy”. Its a bazaar of deep state brokers, spooks, military industrial complex, big entertainment agitprop, alien conspiracy, and techno fetish consumerism. So basically, its a microcosm of the USA Inc.

        I’m gonna drop this 9/11 conspiracy here since it’s rare to see the topic come up in intelligent forums like this. You won’t read this anywhere else.The 9/11 attacks combined were a cover up crime, not a crime in itself. This will upset those who ascribe esoteric meaning or long term planning to it.It all began in the ’80s, during the Bush presidency. He and his intelligence cronies plotted to topple the Soviet Union and profit from the endeavor. They would fund the project with a bond issue of $240 billion dollars. With those proceeds they bought up swaths of Soviet industry. Fast forward to Glastnost, and the union fell, giving rise to the Russian federation.Some theorize that the original plan was to pony up the $ when the bond was due for repayment. Others think they planned to make it disappear somehow. Regardless, the date for repayment was fast approaching, 9/11/2001.Making matters worse, 2 agencies were closing in on the fraudulent bond. Naval intelligence and…ever heard of “The Eldorado Task Force?” Something had to be done to stop the bond from reconciliation because that would identify the parties.Let’s skip ahead to the morning of 9/11. Once the attacks were underway a call was made to the Head of Operations for American Airlines in Boston asking him to check on flight 11. He and a subordinate both walked the terminal and to the gate where they found the plane was still there. Despite being past scheduled departure, there were no passengers waiting and none on the plane. There was no flight crew.At least flight 11 wasn’t hijacked. How then did we get confirmation of any hijacking? Solicitor General, Ted Olsen contacted authorities to explain that he got a call from his wife aboard American flight 77 describing a hijacking scenario. Since then much debate has taken place over the possibility of making such a call by cell phone or seat back phone. But the debate was over when the FBI testified during the moussaoui trial that, “No calls were made between Barbara and Ted Olsen that morning.” Ted is therefore complicit in the attacks.Now let’s consider the specific strikes points on 9/11. In tower 2, Cantor Fitzgerald was struck. In tower 1, Marsh &amp; Mclennon. Tower 6 fell later that afternoon, containing the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission. Tower 6 was a squat building that bizarrely seemed to be gutted before the towers even fell. It contained the Eldorado Task Force. The Pentagon was struck directly at the offices of Naval Intelligence. None in that department survived.But what saved the day for Bush and his coconspirators was when the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission invoked its emergency powers for the first time ever, easing regulatory measures for settling securities trades. The bond was settled electronically, anonymously and may have simply gone unpaid.So, when Usama bin Laden declared himself a patsy just as Oswald had done, it was probably true.

                Yes, but my point is that people can operate independently, with their own motivations.  The big picture can look like a conspiracy, but it can also be numbers of individuals acting in their own selfish personal best interests, layered one person on top of another.  Groupthink can be coordinated into a conspiracy, but not necessarily.  There are fascinating studies showing how far some ordinarily honest people are willing to lie and cheat, if they are sure they won’t personally get caught or be held accountable.  When numbers of those sorts of people congregate, pure individual mendacity can take the appearance of a conspiracy.  I am certain some of the people involved in the Hillary capers structured their efforts into an identifiable conspiracy, but I suspect some of the people involved simply independently jumped on board, sensing a personal opportunity for gain.  Same with the Kavanaugh accusers.

        There are real conspiracies, and then there are “conspiracy theories.”  People draw the line in different places.  I don’t believe virtually any “conspiracy theories.”  I think Oswald acted alone, and I don’t think 9/11 was an “inside job.”  What I don’t like about “conspiracy theories” is I detect, in many, an attempt to salvage the system by arguing that we need new elites, but not a new system.  You don’t need “conspiracy theories” to delegitimize our elite, because our system, which raises them to elite status and incentivizes them, is illegitimate, and you don’t need “conspiracy theories” in order to show this, and resorting to “conspiracy theories” for this only pushes away intelligent, capable people.

                Between spending an hour with someone going through the minutiae of why 9/11 was an inside job, and spending an hour referencing the ideas of, say, Plato, Nietzsche, Spengler, Sorel, Heidegger, Pareto, Carl Schmitt, Evola, de Benoist, Dugin, and so on, to knock out the legs holding up modernity, i.e. holding up liberalism, my bet is that the latter, done correctly, is going to yield much better results.  We all are restricted, to varying degrees, in our free time and our intelligence.  Although, of course, specialization is important, I think the latter path is a better use of one’s time for understanding our world, and for acting to correctly alter it.  I also think that more intelligent people, who can have the most impact in this world, close themselves off from things like the 9/11 inside job argument (even if it is true), and so I think it is a tactical error in changing their minds for the better.  I’ve found that someone referencing conspiracy theories is a strong indicator that they are not worth my time (it’s not 100% though*), and that the more they reference them, the less worthy they are of someone’s time.*Andy Nowicki would be one of these.  Watching him is good for the soul.  He’s comes off as one of the most  decent and genuine human-beings you’d ever meet.  I think he would have made a fantastic parish priest.

                    If it is a mutually exclusive proposition, I agree that it is a better expenditure of one’s time to study, contemplate, and discuss Plato, Spengler, Nietzsche, et al than to delve into the weeds of 9/11.
But, alas, it is not a mutually exclusive proposition, is it?
What is wrong with studying 9/11 and knowing enough to challenge the government conspiracy theory narrative?
If the typical smart person you know reflexively dismisses a 9/11 “truther” but then, when challenged, gets his ass handed to him by the “truther” on the facts, why would you respect such a “smart” person?

                        I just don’t think it’s a good strategy.  Speaking for myself, when I spent some time looking into all that years ago, I was left very skeptical.  The ever ongoing JFK conspiracy theories (countless different ones, all backed up by evidence of course (including a great many “eyewitnesses”), nearly all of which must be false if any one of them is true) have made me skeptical toward anything resembling that scene.  And the “magic bullet” doesn’t seem so magic at all once you look into it some more.  Occam’s Razor and all that, as well.More importantly, whether it is true or not doesn’t matter to me, because I 100% want to burn it all to the ground and rebuild in any case, and this is because an extremely intelligent, extremely well-read commenter at the original altright website (who produced more material (in comment form), and at a higher level, than any 3+ writers for the site) walked me into the world of ideas I mentioned.
