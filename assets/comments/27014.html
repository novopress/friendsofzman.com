        That is, the Global American Empire has no respect for the politics of other countries, so if they see those politics as a hindrance, they will try to decapitate the government and install a friendly regime.
Rather off topic here but I’m not too fond of the moniker GAE: the globalists are not  Americans in any meaningful sense of the word and they’re not espousing American values. It’s notAmericacoupingothercountries because it’s not a bilateral political aggression, it’s the global cabal decapitatinganygovernment they don’t control, like indeed they did to America a year ago.

        The show was excellent.  Well done.On the topic of people not liking or liking the podcast – I’ll add my opinion.  I love the blogs.  They’re short so you don’t feel like it’s a chore to read them, and they’re excellent as far as writing quality.  That being said, I much prefer the podcasts.  I think they’re really well done, but also, it allows me to listen while I’m in the car or while I’m busy with work.  I can’t work and read at the same time, unfortunately, and the podcast allows me to do that.So I guess my point here is that both formats are excellent.  I find time to read ever essay, but listening to the podcasts is a great compliment to the blog.  Keep up the amazing work and your effort is greatly appreciated.

        Off Topic:  Z remarked how dumb Kamala Harris is.  Fine.  Everyone “knows” it.  I do wonder though if it’s just a talking problem.  Or some kind of social anxiety deer-in-headlights thing when the cameras are staring at her.We don’t know her IQ.  I’m guessing 115. Point is, she’s surely much smarter than she sounds.  Actually, she must be smart.   She’s a lawyer.  She passed the difficult California bar exam.  50% failure rate.  Yes, she failed the first time.  I’ve known some very smart guys…one of them a chemical engineer, that failed it the first time too.Some people can’t talk.  Bush Sr. couldn’t put a sentence together.  Yet he was one of the youngest Navy pilots ever.  Degree in economics.  His kid sounds a full deviation dumber, yet, MBA Harvard.  He can’t be dumb.  Maybe not bright.  But going on his education record, and the national average, W. is factually NOT dumb.So, Kamala Harris, secretly smart?  Deceptively dumb?   One thing is certain, she MUST be way smarter than she is.  If only because she sounds really dumb.

            I just listened to the podcast. Z mentions the flipside of my point on Kamala.  “We all mistake linguistic skill for intelligence.”   So then with Kamala, we all mistake linguistic unskill for stupidity.  1:25:20
Granted she is dumb in her worldview.  But we’re talking raw intelligence. If we could see some of her “original” writing, we could get a sense of her depth  But these people always have stuff written for them.

            The California bar isn’t inherently more difficult, it has a inferior group taking the test compared to most states. It has a dozen or more ABA schools (and more schools in the third tier than most states have in total), and dozens of non-ABA toliet schools whose grads are either allowed to take the bar under the CA accreditation standard or the baby bar. So they have tons of morons taking the test.Second, despite being a black with two parent professors with connections, the best school she could attend was Hastings. Hastings is probably the #4-5 school in the state at best, and has declined in recent years.  Based on my experience, that means she scored in the 140s in the LSAT. Being black means you generally scored two standard deviations lower than your honky classmates. That doesn’t translate to a 115 IQ score. It translates to barely above room temp.

            Thomas addressed the main points I was going to make about Kamala, so I’ll move on to Bush. His MBA at Harvard means very little for his intelligence. Daddy’s connections got him in. If you speak to any Harvard grad, they’ll tell you that the hard part is getting in. Once you’re in there, they literally don’t let you fail because it looks bad for the school. A former professor of mine talked about this. If they sense you struggling they will literally hold your hand every step of the way. I would be surprised if he was much higher than 100 IQ. I’ll grant you his dad being smarter than he sounded though.

        Entertaining show.
Why go to church? Fellowship, koinania – good answers. Shared values, group support, bonding – good answers. Not to worry so much about theology as it’s all a big mystery anyway, however the odds say that it is more likely that Jesus is Lord and not George Floyd. Christianity Hellenized the West and built the greatest civilization ever. It’s replacement, Wokism is destroying it and provides evidence that Satan is alive.

        Nice show. I would say however and predictably pessimistically that Nietsche was correct. God is dead, man now worships himself. Or rather, our new religion involves worshiping black people who are the holy, sacred redeemers of the original sin of Whiteness. Literal worship of black people started before Holy George Floyd, but now is the new folk religion of the elites and it will be replacing Christianity.I think within maybe five years tops it will be illegal for White people to have kids with each other. This was actually the law in Paraguay in the 19th Century, not sure if it is still enforced as rigorously as it was then. Already in California there is a bill rapidly progressing to become law that will allow killing of babies by anyone (not just mother) up to 1 month though there is discussion for up to one year. Its like an episode of Black Mirror.Which leads me to the likely next President. After her election (pretty much slam dunk) as Governor of Georgia, Stacy Abrams is likely the next President of the United States. She’s already been President of Earth (in a Star Trek episode). And it makes sense — we worship blacks so find the most black person ever to be President. The hard times and real hunger and deprivation will only make the elites AND the people double down on worship of blacks. Its really the natural outcome for the West and I simply don’t see anything other than the West all being dissolved into Greater Africa, genetically, culturally, and every other way.Sorry to be a downer, but the die was cast a long time ago. Even Nietsche could see some of the outlines in the 1880s; and militant atheist that he was, he did not think that the loss of Christian belief was a good thing but rather the harbinger of doom.

            I agree with everything you just said.  For me personally, the race thing is my biggest issue and causes me the most frustration.  The worshipping of the criminal race makes me absolutely crazy and is the source of 99% of the anger in my life.  I can’t even be in a room hearing someone say anything about the merits of George Floyd.  I just can’t be present.I can totally see the Jabba the Abrams being president.  At this point, the full on retard of our society knows no bounds.“I think within maybe five years tops it will be illegal for White people to have kids with each other.”I don’t know if it will be quite that soon, but it is certainly coming.  It is already acceptable for joggers to murder whites without consequence.  They can do no wrong.I’m in my mid 40s, so when I was growing up, I was all in on true equality, and blank slate and all of that idiocy.  When I was about 18 and started college in the early 90s, it all changed.  I went to a private college that was a catholic college.  Out of 2500 students at that time, about 3% of them were black.  What I found was that ALL of those students went to school tuition free.  It didn’t matter what their socio-economic status was, they were simply granted scholarships for existing.  I had a few classes with some of them.  All of them were sub-par students at best.  I would never see them in the library or in the science lab.  However, as soon as I hit the gym to play pick-up basketball, they were there doing their thing.  I started thinking back to my HS days and it dawned on me that they were always being ushered to the front of the line at the expense of someone else (mostly white) who deserved it instead.  It was maddening, and at this point in my life I’ve developed a full-on loathing of them.  They embrace every bit of the victim-hood and regardless of whether or not they seem based or “nice”, they will always be black first.  Always…

You need to do one of two things.  Modify your perception of them.  Knowing that they were brought here against their will.  And have become part of the current sweep of history far beyond their control. And that there are many great things about blacks.  Or secondly, think about race as little as possible.   Protect your mental health my friend.  Peace.

        Fascinating and terrific podcast, thanks for posting it.As a severely lapsed Scotch-Irish Presbyterian Southerner (almost redundant, that; more agnostic than anything now but glad to have been raised in the faith) who lives among a sea of Catholics, it always is interesting to hear the Western RC take on culture. I can’t get the take on the other guy’s origin (Canadian who has lived a while in the UK, to take a guess), but he’s a sharp young man.Pulling out for a wider view, the return to faith seems a substitute for a return to racial identity: Orthodoxy for Slavs and disenchanted Catholics, Catholicism for lapsed Catholics and Westerners who want to pay homage to their cultural roots, and, eventually, for mainstream Protestants like me to re-establish our identities as White Southerners/Greater Americans and religiously dissident Northern Europeans. Say what you will about Putin, no man has read the zeitgeist of the moment better than he with the re-establishment of Orthodoxy in Russia. No matter how cynical his motivations, the model has been a wild success and will be followed in non-suicidal nations throughout the West. Spit balling, the cynicism to antagonize Russia into its invasion of the Ukraine sprung from a panicked realization in the West that this may be the future and the greatest threat to its cultural hegemony, which has some good bits along with the massive corrosion of the soul it causes.Again, thanks.

        Nice Saturday Zman bonus. Zman holding court at the after school special. You guys mentioned Fuentes a few times. Been watching him lately, he seems to talk about his hair a lot lately. Doesn’t look like he’s enjoying doing his show anymore, might be happier living in Russia is the impression I’m getting.
