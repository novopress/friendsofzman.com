        Another problem is that rock music is generally too masculine for this limp-wristed age of ultra-feminization. Anything that bears even a whiff of testosterone scares people.

            More accurately, white masculinity. Whiteness plus masculinity equals toxicity for the pomos and sundry other hysterical cowards and nut-jobs.

                Rock music (as opposed to R &amp; B and later hip-hop and [c]rap) has been almost exclusively melanin-deprived since the 1960s (Jimi Hendrix having been a very rare exception). So the whiteness of the masculinity is implicit when discussing the topic. While I agree that white masculinity is especially despised in this degraded civilization of ours, masculinity appears to be held in low esteem in general. After all, leniency toward black thuggishness notwithstanding, the term ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù does not specify a particular race. I think it advantages the powers that be if men in general are weak and ineffectual. Of course, because the most effective rebels would inevitably arise from the ranks of the melanin-deprived, white masculinity is hated more than any other. But the larger preference for feminization deserves attention too. Elites aim to cultivate a society of women basically. Women are herd creatures averse to doing anything that might risk their own status within the tribe.

                    The reason white masculinity is condemned in particular, is because the Power Structure wants us weak and defenseless. If we‚Äôre willing to stand up and fight, we‚Äôre a threat. If we just lie down and take it, we can be eliminated at will. That genocidal motive does not operate against non-white males.

                        Agreed. Nevertheless, hostility toward masculinity in general and considerably greater hatred for white masculinity in particular are not mutually exclusive of one another. Keep in mind that the ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù craze disproportionately targeted members of a certain tribe distinct from white goyim. The push to anathematize normal straight male sexual desire is more effective if it doesn‚Äôt too obviously focus on one specific group.

Can you think of a case of ‚Äútoxic maxulinity‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt involve a white-ish man?  I can‚Äôt.
They‚Äôre going after that ‚ÄúP Diddy‚Äù fellow, and before that, Fuentes‚Äô friend Kayne, but I haven‚Äôt heard the epithet ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù used in either case.

                                You‚Äôre not wrong. Since you raise the point . . . it seems to me the progtards aren‚Äôt using ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù much to describe anyone these days. They tend to have short attention spans and a propensity for concocting fresh absurdities that crowd out the staler ones. Go back roughly four or five years ago and I guarantee that ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù was being thrown around a lot more frequently than now. Perhaps it‚Äôs lost much of whatever cachet it originally had.

                    Hendrix is an interesting case because he showed that whites were willing to make a black guy a star, if that guy made music within the rock tradition. I find it interesting that few followed his trail.
Although there were a few acts like Prince, Lenny Kravitz or Living Color who followed in Hendrix‚Äôs footsteps, almost all chose not to follow.
I can think of many whites guys I‚Äôve known who would have loved to make a black guy who played rock a star. They love Slash. Lots of black musicians left money on the table. Did they know this?

            Let‚Äôs ponder that a moment.Why do/did guys (and let‚Äôs be frank, it‚Äôsusuallyguys) form bands in their youth? What‚Äôs the biggest motivator for young guys once they hit puberty?Hmm, I bet it has two X chromosomes. And a cute butt.Even the worst garage band you can imagine (that sounds like a stand of pots and pans falling over when they play) can manage to getsomeinterest from some girl somewhere.(Heck, maybe she‚Äôll be enamored enough to sing with them üòÇ)When I were a young lad (checks belt to see onion üßÖ is secured) I had two friends that started a band in high school that actually got booked into some dive bars in Chicago, and a college roommate who was in a band that got booked into dive bars around Directional State U. They all got some manner of chicks.Do young guys now eventryto get female attention? One suspects if you can create music on your computer why try to play a guitar?

                The groupie strategy still exists for men but it‚Äôs based on being a streamer.  Same principle applies, if the dude appears to be popular by having a lot of viewers that tricks the woman‚Äôs brain into thinking the guy is high status and all women want more than anything else is to be attached to a high status guy in order to one-up their friends.

                Many years ago I had a friend who played in a bar band, mostly in SoCal but also across the western USA. He was manic depressive and when the depression would hit him he would get religion and seek guidance from ministers. He told me about one session with a minister when the discussion got around to my friend‚Äôs sexual sins. When he gave the minister an estimate of how many women he had intercourse with, the guy thought he was pulling his leg (he wasn‚Äôt).

            The gol‚Äôdarn kids today with their crap music. That‚Äôs a song old as, well‚Ä¶ songs.To be fair, the rap shite is epidemic among many youths but I think maybe you should interact with young people more.Metal is popular from older bands like Iron Maiden to newer ones like Sabaton. Particularly among the gym-going bunch.Folksy type newer music is also catching on. I was whistling a tune in the locker room and two young men looked at me surprised and asked, ‚ÄúYou like ‚ÄòThe Dead South‚Äù?When we do get younger singers at the VFW karaoke night they tend to belt out old Cash or Lynard songs.Admittedly the girls tend toward Pink, Perry, Adele, Swift etc‚Ä¶ but when has the female population ever followed anything that bucked convention without men first doing so?Anyhow, just standing up for younger folks. Get a little tired of hearing us geezers heap all the woes of the world on them. A world of garbage that we failed to protect them from and they simply inherited without knowing things were different once.

                I agree with your defense of younger people; as part of Gen-X, I readily admit that my generation and the Boomers have failed today‚Äôs kids in many ways. But my original comment in no way slandered the youth. I won‚Äôt hesitate to concede that there are still young men out there who prefer masculine content. In fact, it‚Äôs something of a minor miracle that they do, considering how much feminization has been heaped upon these fellows. Anyway, as an old rock song told us, ‚Äúthe kids are alright.‚Äù I did not intend to suggest otherwise.

        I never understood the appeal of post-WW2 American popular culture and music as a child, although I tried to fit in and listen to what was at the time the all-consuming balls-out longhair power rock of the 1970s and 1980s. I despised it.In 6th grade I mocked Led Zeppelin in class and was accosted on the playground afterward by two morons, both of whom now live in Florida selling real estate. In 12th grade I wrote an op-ed for the school paper running down the Grateful Dead and the 1960s in general, and had the same unpleasant experience with idiots.I was essentially attacking their identity ‚Äî DeadHeads, or whatever they were called. LedZep fans who decorated their school notebooks with the logos of Aerosmith, The Who, et alia, took it very, very seriously.Perhaps that has been replaced with other ersatz forms of identity sold to children. Either way, all of it was a mistake and certainly part of the Untergang.As Plato wrote inThe Republic, a change in musical form presages a change in regimes. Music is essential to the education of the young. Here we are, 50 years into our new regime.Lesson (pointless to learn it now, I know): If you don‚Äôt do it, someone else will. So now we have 8-year-old girls listening to obese black women ‚Äúrap‚Äù about descriptions of oral and anal sex, the absolute lowest, most revolting, most animalistic features of our existence ‚Äî and do nothing to stop it.

            I hear you. Most of my cohorts listened to Van Halen and Aerosmith; and I was listening to Maynard Ferguson and Jeff Lorber Fusion. But I did enjoy power rock from time to time. I had to be in the right mood for it.
My conversion to rock took place in fall of ‚Äô79 when I discovered what I later learned was called ‚Äúprog rock‚Äù (ELP, Yes, Genesis, etc.) on the album oriented rock station in my city. I had never heard of prog rock before and found that I liked it as much as fusion jazz.

                        Phil Collins is also a tremendous vocalist.  When Gabriel left Genesis, it was amazing that they had a vocalist in the wings whose register was so similar but who also had a much better range.

                            When Gabriel left Genesis, they auditioned about 100 singers, with drummer Collins instructing them how to sing the parts.  After awhile the band members noticed that Collins sang the songs better than the auditioners, and asked if he would be interested.  Collins‚Äô first thought was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a drummer, dammit, not a singer!‚Äù  He eventually warmed up to the idea and the rest is history‚Ä¶.

                Around 1979 is when suddenly progressive rock became out of fashion with the emergence of punk and new wave.  Yes and Genesis survived by changing their style to fit the times, but bands like Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer did not, and overnight, sounded dated.  And I say that as a fan of the genre.

                    Very true. Actually, I think prog rock fell out of favor a little earlier than that, around 1977 or so. Nevertheless, it is what I discovered on that rock station in fall of 1979. Punk and new wave bored the hell out of me.
That album oriented rock station stopped being album oriented in summer of  1980 and just played whatever hit rock songs there were (AC/DC, Pat Travers, etc.), then replaced by a top 40 station in 1984. Oh well.

            Very well put.  I was there back then too, and I saw exactly what you‚Äôre talking about.  Rock became a very primal, tribal thing, with all the negatives that involves.  And while I liked some of rock‚Äìthe Who, Blue Oyster Cult, etc.‚Äìthe passions that became wrapped up with it said something disturbing about us.  No matter how ‚Äúedgy‚Äù the group was, there was a great deal of conformity involved.I watched a video recently of a hard rock concert, with all the jumping up and down and writhing and head-banging and other mass behavior, and it really hit home to me‚Äìthese people (mostly young men) are all being very manipulated.  Now, I was pretty much an idiot too when I was a teenager and in my early-20‚Äôs, but all of this mass stupidity was very much encouraged from On High.

                This will be an unpopular comment here, but Allan Bloom was correct in his re-introduction of Plato‚Äôs strictures against music and the young soul. Can‚Äôt do anything about it now, though. Most on this site will fight to the death that ‚Äútheir generation‚Äôs‚Äù music was authentic and had no effect upon them, but the kids today, oh yeah, bad stuff, not good for them.I read ‚ÄúHammer of the Gods‚Äù about LedZep when I was 8 or 9 and figured it out then. Rest of my life since then has been spent with idiots who listened to that garbage and idolized the guitar virtuosos of their youth, with no sense of the effect that the lifestyle glamorized by those musicians was the point ‚Äî not the music. And the lifestyle and morals they fostered are what became our culture.

                    ‚Äúthe lifestyle glamorized by those musicians was the point ‚Äî not the music. And the lifestyle and morals they fostered are what became our culture.‚ÄùAnother great point.  You‚Äôre not alone!  I too was convinced by a lot of what Allan Bloom wrote in The Closing of the American Mind, including his critique of rock.  And as ‚Äúuncool‚Äù as it is to say, those old preachers had a point about rock and roll being the devil‚Äôs music.  Again, I fell heavily for rock in my teens and twenties.  And for a while I was considered to be very much ‚Äúin the know‚Äù as far as supposedly innovative, alternative stuff.  But the vast majority of it really is something that is best left behind.  Not that I have all the answers, and I‚Äôm sure I still have my blind spots, but yes, it‚Äôs hard to give up certain sacred cows, and to admit that one has been manipulated.

                        Well, the rock group Rush was certainly not the devil‚Äôs music. The themes to Rush music were very uplifting.

                            I liked what I heard of Rush (didn‚Äôt keep up with them after the early 80s), including their themes, like you said.  A bit like them, Blue Oyster Cult was another group that wasn‚Äôt PC, and which was actually talented musically.  Some of the other prog rock appealed to me, but a lot of it got too overblown.Anyway, I just think that people need to be more aware of how manipulative the actual styles of rock music are.  They do affect us physically in ways which aren‚Äôt always good.  I know I sound like a holy rollin‚Äô preacher with that, but there‚Äôs truth in it.Melody and harmony were great strengths of western music, and when rock focused on those, I think it was better.

                                Incidentally, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Fear the Reaper,‚Äù is possibly the most evil song ever written. The lyrics speak for themselves.
And curiously enough, most BOC fans at the time the song was released, said that it sounded nothing like BOC. And the guy who wrote the song‚Äìhis name escapes me‚Äìsaid he just woke up one morning and the song was in his head. I believe Satan implanted it. And I‚Äôm not joking.

                                    There‚Äôs certainly an argument to be made for that, especially considering the effect the song might have on troubled, impressionable people.Well, that could be said for the various effects which a lot of popular culture has had since ca. 1965, couldn‚Äôt it?And you might be referring to the BOC guitarist Don ‚ÄúBuck Dharma‚Äù Roeser.  He seems like a bright, thoughtful and overall good guy.  I think he also said something along the lines that he was horrified anyone would take the song as an encouragement to suicide (not that I want to excuse where the song might come from, if you‚Äôre right).  Also in Roeser‚Äôs favor, I know that he at least used to be open to conservative views, back when ‚Äúconservative‚Äù was just about the only exposure most people had to anything right-leaning.  Seemed pretty courageous, considering how few people in pop culture would have admitted to that.

                                    I dislike that song as well. It came out on their ‚ÄúAgents of Fortune‚Äù album, which marked their decline to me. I liked BOC‚Äôs earlier stuff. ‚ÄúOn Your Feet or On Your Knees‚Äù is my favorite BOC album.

                    Yes, 100% agree. As a young student I learned a bit of guitar and bass and aspired to be a rock-n-roller. After all, these people were regarded as important, people thronged to see them, and playing music all night and getting chicks and free beer sure beat getting up at 5 a.m. for a shift in the steel mill, right?But after trying to form a couple of pick-up bands I quit cold turkey right around the time I read Bloom‚Äôs‚ÄúClosing of the American Mind‚Äùand never looked back. When analyzing pop music to try to learn it, I discovered it was, at best, literal ‚Äúnon-sense,‚Äù and at worst, pure degeneracy celebrating drugs and deviant or promiscuous sex.I addition to having no musical talent, I was simply not stupid or deviant enough to do it. I just couldn‚Äôt relate to it.Plato was right ‚Äî inThe Republic, Socrates argued for the censorship of music and poetry, because it short-circuits the reasoning process. The appeal is directly visceral and non-rational. Nobody can actually define what a ‚Äúgood‚Äù song is. Music that people regard as ‚Äúgood‚Äù simply triggers an emotional response that is immune to thought and reason. If it is warped music, it warps the soul.Today I listen to jazz. I prefer bebop and 1970s fusion but I don‚Äôt attempt to play it. I never get tired of listening to ‚ÄúKind of Blue‚Äù ‚Äî but even bebop was regarded as degenerate negro music in the 1950s. I listened to quite a bit of classic country for a while, but even a lot of that was heavily contrived and rigged by the music industry. Selected artists, like Merle Haggard and Ricky Skaggs, were the real deal and produced (mostly) honest and thoughtful music.I simply can‚Äôt stomach how ubiquitous and mainstream the degenerate Boomer classic rock has become, though‚Ä¶ you can be in the grocery store buying laundry detergent with a bunch of haggard 75-year olds and the store is playing ZZ Top‚Äôs ‚ÄúPearl Necklace‚Äù on the PA, for fuck‚Äôs sake‚Ä¶

            Ha ha! You amused me with your Milli Vanilli reference. Technically those clowns didn‚Äôt even use their own recordings on-stage; they used recordings performed entirely by other musicians and singers. You could definitely credit them with being innovators in the art of fakery.

                I remember the Milli Vanilli fiasco in summer of 1989. I also remember one of the reasons it blew up was due to a father who was dragged into taking his ‚Äòtween daughter and her friends to the outdoor concert that took place. He really did not want to be there in the first place and was in a critical state of mind when the recording jammed and he, along with everyone else, saw the performers were not singing at all. It was this father who went to the media and then sued the concert promoter. That‚Äôs how all of this became public. It was all really hilarious how it unfolded in the media.

            Aside from the swifties, its the classic rock shows from the 1970‚Äôs that make the real money touring. As long as boomers are willing to pay several hundred dollars for a seat, classic rock will continue to tour. Some of these guys are getting too old for the road. Pete Townsend and Roger Daltry starting putting on a lackluster show 15 years ago. I think they have retired from the road now. Mick Jagger had some sort of medical issue last year, resulting him in retiring from the road. I think the Stones are really out of it now.I attended a ZZ Top concert in 2007 (front row seats, could not hear for three days afterwards). They put on a good show. But ZZ Top music is more blues like, which is more appropriate for an older band. Dusty Hill died a couple of years ago and I think ZZ Top has hung it up.Neal Pert died at beginning of 2020. But Rush had retired after their R40 tour in fall of 2015. They retired Johnny Carson style, at a time when they were still good.

                On geriatric musicians shilling way past their expiration date I agree.One notable exception  are the final complications of Johnny Cash in American Recordings.His voice, much withered but still unnervingly deep,  is achingly wonderful. He works through a catalog from 1940s Vera Lynn to Nine Inch Nails.I don‚Äôt know if he or someone else devised the song selection‚Ä¶ but it is a masterpiece.It‚Äôs as if someone had the wisdom to recognise they had one brief moment before he was gone, to capture that voice and apply it to decades of other‚Äôs music.The age and gravel is a perfect application. A few songs will actually make my eyes mist.

            Rock stars don‚Äôt age well for the obvious reason that they lived so hard in their youth. Strangely enough, however, and excepting those killed in plane crashes, they seem to be fairly long-lived. The fact that Keith Richards is still alive and kicking is surely one of the great mysteries of this century.

        Taylor Swift is worth close study in a lot of ways, and yeah, I know how that sounds, but it‚Äôs true. There seems to be an entire business model of ‚ÄúInstagram influencers‚Äù trying to be pop stars now (e.g. Addison Rae). The prototype isn‚Äôt Swift, but Justin Bieber, but still, that‚Äôs one interesting attempt to re-energize pop music, and Swift has certainly shown them the way to do it. The problem, though, is that Swift pretty much IS the Millennial-and-under archetype. She‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no money to be made by being a cut-rate copy of Taylor Swift, because she‚Äôs everywhere.And she‚Äôs also the archetype in another way, in that she‚Äôs the least attractive hot girl on the planet. She‚Äôs physically attractive, sure, but anyone over age 40 looks at her and sees a creepy, awkward, downright dorky woman who is waaaay too old to be acting like that (Wiki says she‚Äôs 34, but she acts like the worst caricature of a 45 year old ‚Äúwine aunt‚Äù). She tries so, so hard to be sexy, but it‚Äôs like a badly programmed AI version of ‚Äúsexy.‚Äù She‚Äôs a walking, talking uncanny valley, and that‚Äôs the point ‚Äî based on long experience with Basic College Girls, I can tell you that that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre all like now. It‚Äôs frankly terrifying, but if you want to know what the upcoming generation of our Insect Overlords are really like, watch Taylor Swift.

                Somehow Taylor Swift‚Äôs songs, her beats, her lyrics, simply hack young female brains, and I‚Äôll loosely define ‚Äúyoung‚Äù in that context as anywhere from 6 to 28. There‚Äôs no other way to describe it. Her lyrics aren‚Äôt terribly engaging, the musical compositions are just barely serviceable, but somehow she hits that stream-of-consciousness rhythm that must be very close to how a female brain tends to think, and so the ‚Äòhack‚Äô occurs and a Swiftie is born. Then, as you say, she pairs the songs with some kind of through-the-looking-glass projection of what said young female brains think qualifies as ‚ÄúHOT‚Äù to males which reinforces the hack.This kind of dovetails with the concept that what females think males want, tends to actually be the opposite of what males want. So Swift is projecting for her fans what they think is the image of ‚ÄúHOT girl!‚Äù while most males look for a moment and think, ‚ÄúMeh, can do better than that.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs the closest I can come as a male to explaining Swift. Only her very earliest country work holds the slightest appeal for me, and even that is just mediocre country music.

                    That‚Äôs not it. It doesn‚Äôt have a damn thing to do with what females think males want. It is about what females think they themselves can achieve and attain.Back in the day, movie actresses were beautiful, because the men who were paying for the tickets wanted to see beautiful women. This is what got us Marilyn Monroe, Raquel Welch, and Farrah Fawcett. As women moved into the workforce, they started having their own money and buying their own movie tickets, and they find beautiful women like that intimidating. So beauty had to be redefined for the female moviegoer, so she could feel better about herself, since she was paying now and she wasn‚Äôt going to pay to feel intimidated. So they featured horse faced Julia Roberts and told us she was beautiful. She presented a picture of ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù that was not so out of reach to average women, allowing them to feel that they themselves were or could be beautiful, and they were willing to pay for that illusion. Because it gives them tingles. You wouldn‚Äôt have any trouble finding women who would honestly tell you that Roberts, or Hillary Swank, or Renee Zellwegger are beautiful. Because Hollywood said they are, they are on the screen, it must be true, and now the prole woman herself feels beautiful. It‚Äôs worked so well that even bugmen have bought into the illusion.Same thing with Swift. It‚Äôs why she‚Äôs up there dancing in skimpy costumes for crowds of heterosexual women. She is just attractive enough to be sold as beautiful, and just plain enough that her status is felt by other women to be attainable. Because if she can be a paragon of beauty and desirability, a lot of them can too. And they will pay billions to drink in that illusion. Not a single one of them will ever admit this. Most aren‚Äôt even consciously aware.

        I‚Äôm one of the old dinosaurs who still buys CD‚Äôs. As with digital books, I don‚Äôt have confidence that there will be a long-term availability of certain kinds of digital music, including classical. Until recently, at least, if you ‚Äúbought‚Äù a digital book, you still didn‚Äôt own the full, permanent rights to it. Considering how much our Betters disapprove of everything from our ancestors, and the continuing statements from people like Tony Blair, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry about what they think of free speech, I would much rather have hard copies of books and music, even if they are a lot more expensive. So far, I‚Äôve had good experiences buying CD‚Äôs athttps://www.discogs.com/You can buy vinyl there also.

                Yes.  And Gone With the Wind has been altered in recent DVD printings.  In at least one instance, Pork, a black slave who is sympathetically portrayed (like most of the blacks in GWTW), has his speech censored.

                    They‚Äôre probably right. Fleming, being a creature of the intel community, would no doubt sing the company line along with the rest of them about how we need to defeat the racisms, protect our democracy from misinformation etc. etc.
I did recently have no problem getting the entire Fleming Bond collection in its original form, used, for about $100, between Thriftbooks and Ebay.

                        But Fleming was a racist, and he suffered fools uneasily. There is no way he would have countenanced a pack of Leftist hacks doing a hatchet job on his life‚Äôs work.

            I still record my old cassettes onto CDs with my aged Sony CD player/recorder. It finally died and I discovered that such units are no longer made. I was able to find a little company in Arizona that reconditions old stereo equipment and they had a repaired model of my old Sony. I‚Äôm back in the recording business.

        One thing you are leaving out is that this pop music is pumped into every public place all the time.  Every retail store blasts mostly 20-40 year old pop music at its customers. Sporting events have it playing constantly when there is not live action happening.  The quality of newly produced music is way down and it is noticeable even to the average person.  They have oversaturated public spaces with bad music and people want a break from it.

        As a Boomer, I was used to major changes in pop music every couple of years: Elvis, the Beatles and Stones, acid rock, prog rock, punk rock and disco, etc. But since rap ‚Äúmusic‚Äù started taking over five decades ago, there have been no changes. Come to think of it, even new innovative jazz and classical music died around the same time.

            Every decade had ‚Äúnew‚Äù music starting around 1910. The 2000‚Äôs was the first decade that had no ‚Äúnew‚Äù music. Same for the 2010‚Äôs. It was about 7-8 years ago I gave up hoping for new music.
Jazz declined dramatically in the early 80‚Äôs. I‚Äôm not sure why this happened. Only smooth jazz survived. Smooth jazz died in the late 2010‚Äôs.

                David Sanborn was at one time a neighbor and he hated going far away for gigs but he did many in Japan ($$$) as they loved any kind of jazz-real or smooth.

                    David Sanborn was good. I used to listen to him as well. He and Tom Scott. I believe David passed away just recently. Tom Scott is not active these days. Jeff Lorber is definitely active. I bought his last album (mp3 really), The Drop. It is quite good.

                        Well, that‚Äôs terrible news. Didn‚Äôt realize Sanborn died, but he did five months ago.
Regardting Tom Scott, he played the sax in McCartney‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat the Man Says.‚Äù As the story goes, McCartney was getting ready to record the song, sans saxophone, when somebody told him Scott lived near the recording studio. McCartney told him to give Scott a call and see if he‚Äôd be interested in helping out with the song. Scott showed up, sax in hand, in less than an hour, and contributed an  smashing impromptu solo that took the song to a higher level.

                AFAIC, the last worthwhile decade for pop music was the 80s. I tuned out in March of ‚Äô92 because there was simply nothing being produced I wanted to listen to anymore. And I gather it‚Äôs only gotten far worse in the intervening years.
As for jazz, I think much that was worthwhile continued being recorded well into the 90s. Beyond that, perhaps precious little.

                I got a courtesy ride from the Toyota Dealer ship.  The driver was a jazz musician.  He went on an angry [and fully justified rant] that the local jazz club wanted HIM to pay for the chance to play at the club.
‚ÄúI have more education than a doctor for crissakes! And they want ME to pay!?‚Äù
Anyone who thinks they can make a living playing music nowadays is going to be sad.

            Jazz and orchestral music were buried alive in academia. They were recategorized from trade to profession, and innovation ended soon after‚Äîas far as the public knows. There‚Äôs a fringe of interesting new things but nobody hears about them, as in all the school-bound arts.Popular music is suffering a related fate, but the death of radio/etc. is more a part of the broad death of corporate innovation‚ÄîAmerica‚Äôs progress from Bell Labs to Sweet Baby Inc‚Äîcaused not least by ‚ÄúHR.‚Äù The innovations of the rock era were almost all the work ofnormal losers, now systematically excluded from the business. Every new face of pop is some kind of ‚Äúnepo baby,‚Äù typically from banking or intelligence.Fake and/or gay, as we say. And people don‚Äôt like it, but it‚Äôs all there is.

                    I vaguely recall reading a sci-fi novel or was it a short story? Can‚Äôt remember. Anyway, I think it was called The Doorand the premise was everybody used a star trek transporter to get around and the thought of going outside was terrifying.

            We‚Äôve been in freefall for close to 60 years. But because the West was at such an empyrian height, the decline went on for decades before even sensitive people really noticed. Now it‚Äôs only the very young and the very obtuse who don‚Äôt recognize that we live in the outskirts of Hell.

                The dirty truth of phone csmeraes is that they are partly digital paintings.

        ‚ÄúOtherwise, the golden era of popular music, especially rock music, will be viewed as a strange artifact of the American empire. A generation from now that music may sound as weird and alien to young people as Chinese opera.‚ÄùIt already does. It belonged to the golden age of the empire, when the young had a future full of promise, money was easy to come by. blue collar jobs were well-paid and plentiful, and there was some semblance of working-class culture. That‚Äôs all vanished in the post-industrial wastelands of the USA and satellites such as Britain. I‚Äôm reminded of Bifo Berardi‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúAfter the Future‚Äù, a review of which can be found here:https://viewpointmag.com/2012/05/18/lifeboat-communism-a-review-of-franco-bifo-berardis-after-the-future/Concerning the artificially engendered Covid crisis, it has had an enduring impact on consumption and socializing patterns, as well as the world of work. We‚Äôre not going back to the pre-Covid world. You see this particularly in the cities ‚Äî NYC is not going to be what it was.

        In the past, bands used concert tours to promote record sales.  The ticket would only be 2 or 3 times the cost of the record.  Now they record music to promote the very expensive concert tickets.

            If your band could sell 10,000 records, your band was a lower middle class job for four guys. Touring is how you got to 10,000 (and became an alcoholic with herpes).Current equivalent popularity is about a million plays on Spotify/etc. That‚Äôll net you zero dollars or less‚Äîon average much less, negativemanythousands sunk into services and supplies for musicians (our company store). The business only paysthe businessnow. True capitalism has been achieved.The claim is the ticket sellers are gouging the consumer with demand-based pricing, which is like saying no one goes to a restaurant because it is too crowded.Fine libertarian sentiment. Can‚Äôt be true.Truer:Demand is as fake as public opinion. Nobody can buy tickets to anything. Only bots can, mostly run by the ticketing companies themselves. The giant black curtain concealing the emptiness of the venue is the star of every ‚Äúsold out‚Äù show. Enough seats are released to the public to maintain the illusion of a market‚Äîand no more. It‚Äôs inefficient.All the money my rock star friends make is from corporate licensing. The ones who aren‚Äôt in the business-to-business business, no matter how famous they seem, have normal jobs. Touring is vacation.And if I want to see them I have toask, because there‚Äôs no way to buy a ticket.

                The trick is to skip the big names.  There are a lot of small venues playing B-list musicians where tickets can be had for $100 or less.

        These giant mega-tours are another vestige of boomer culture that is on its way out. Believe it or not, the Rolling Stones were a top-3 band in terms of concert revenue as recently as 2021. They‚Äôre now dying off and just getting too old to keep doing it. Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs wife has a particularly insidious cancer that will unfortunately keep him off the road. Aerosmith had to call of its touring, permanently, because Steven Tyler‚Äôs voice is shot. While these concerts were filled with the young and old alike, it‚Äôs not like the old are going to now spend that money on Charli XCX and Kendrick Lamar. They‚Äôre done, and they are the ones, perversely, with money to spend.Like so many other things, we started to think that boomer culture was eternal. You also see all these old artists selling their catalogs to record companies for hundreds of millions of dollars. Those companies are desperate for content and they understand that the new crop of artists isn‚Äôt producing it, so they will try to sell Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen until the end of time. Honestly it‚Äôs not a bad idea because this music is of a much higher quality than what you get today and it is easy for young people to find it.

                We stopped in a store in a nearby tourist town a few weeks ago that advertised ‚Äòrock‚Äô t shirts (younger son is into ‚Äô70s ‚Äì ‚Äô90s metal).  Every single shopper had gray hair  (with the exception of our son and the sales girls).  The whole era of ‚Äòfollowing‚Äô a band and obsessing about its music is a totally boomer phenomenon these days.  I was never as into music as a teen as were my peers.  I went to a few concerts in the ‚Äô70s, but the crowds and the huge indoor venues did nothing for me.  My older son took took me to see Hammerfall and Sabaton precovid and I enjoyed it immensely ‚Äì the music and the much smaller venue.  Meanwhile Istoically endure my husband‚Äôs insistence on endlessly listening to ‚Äô70s ‚Äì ‚Äô90s rock on the radio while driving.  Silence is golden.

        I saved for a nice Pioneer system when I was a teenager and used my vinyl albums as masters to record cassettes I could listen to in the car.As for live shows, we saw our favorite bands playing big colosseums.  Today I would rather see an indie band playing greasy blues at a local dive bar.

            I agree. A few of my friends and I saw Asia on their 25th anniversary tour at a small club ‚Äì 200 seats ‚Äì and it was a fantastic show. They not inly did their own material, but they threw in some King Crimson and a few songs by Yes as well.

        I suppose technology has also killed the garage band, as well, which, of course provided the raw talent for rock. Today, an aspiring guitarist can get online and play with a bassist from Japan, a drummer from Brazil and a singer in England. He‚Äôs not forced to find some local kids to play together and learn how to be a band like normal humans, in the same room, and play live in front of others with a human feedback loop instead of social media comments.

        Music is suffering from the lack of people who can play a musical instrument. In the 50‚Äôs and early 60‚Äôs the Detroit pub schools had a great music program. They produced the raw material that made Motown. The same thing led to thousands of garage bands spending all their free time learning to play guitars, drums, and bass. And rock was born. Rap is a response to a lack of ability to play an instrument. Just synthesizers and screaming to a background beat. It is amazing how the songs I listened to in high school and collage are making up the playlist of so many radio stations .

            In my blue-collar city back in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs, there were loads of opportunities for kids to learn music, in and out of the public schools.  One of my big regrets is that I passed up a good opportunity to take piano lessons.  It would have been very affordable too.

                    I used to think I had natural rhythm, before I took up the piano. Like you, based on my guitar playing, I thought I was naturally musically inclined, before I took up the piano. I haven‚Äôt touched a guitar in years but I can still pick one up anytime and play some songs. Piano otoh is a bitch. After three years of practicing 2 hours a day, every day, I still sucked.

                        Hell yes. My poor piano teacher, oh my goodness‚Ä¶ I could play the notes and chords, but my timing was terrible. She didn‚Äôt give a damn about the notes and chords, but about the tempo. And she was right; even with a metronome my timing was for shit.I quit out of sympathy for my piano teacher.As for the guitar, being a natural and total left-hander, but not being a Jimi Hendrix or Paul McCartney, who taught themselves how to play ‚Äúthe wrong way‚Äù, I tried to learn from the books but the whole reversal thing was just too weird, like reading Arabic (right to left).At least I have a good baritone voice and enjoy singing in church. No training needed, just an ear for the music.

                    I recommend you watch the movie Shine, about the life and times of concert pianist David Helfgott. Doubtless rather sensationalized after the Hollywood fashion, but still a remarkable exposition of learning and playing the piano at the very highest level.

        The ‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù of popular music, a major consequence of technological change, ironically led to a massive decline in quality. Despite all the anecdotes about evil record labels, their executives risked a lot of money signing acts and producing records. Failure had career consequences. The editorial function worked in that era. Now, the lowest common denominator gives us Taylor Swift and an entire generation of no-talent hacks.

        With Taylor Swift, I‚Äôm sure that a tremendous amount of the appeal is because of the media hype.  That has actually probably been the case since ‚Äúpop music‚Äù began, although some big, hyped performers such as Bing Crosby, Elvis, and the Beatles actually did have loads of talent, and deserved the praise.Someone like Springsteen, though, was hyped through the roof, way beyond his abilities.  I remember in the 70‚Äôs when the media seemed to do a coordinated Springsteen blitz.  I know, he‚Äôs supposedly a great performer, etc., etc., and I know that some of these evaluations are subjective, but he never held a candle to a lot of really talented people.

            Even the classic acts like the Beatles are way overrated. St. Peppers is a good album. But I don‚Äôt care for any other Beatles music. You are 100% spot-on about Bruce Springsteen being way overrated even by the standards of being overrated.
I honestly do not understand why Taylor Swift is so popular. This is a complete mystery to me.

            Of course it is hard (for me, anyway) to objectively evaluate Sprinsteen‚Äôs music because he‚Äôs such an asshole. I admit that there are four or five songs of his that I like, but they‚Äôre all covers, my favorite being ‚ÄúThe Fever‚Äù by Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, which kicks ass.
I remember that media blitz, like when Springsteen made the cover ofTimein 1975. WTF? No one had ever heard of the guy and suddenly he‚Äôs being portrayed as the next Bob Dylan. Had to be a psyop.

                Yes.  And he made the cover of Newsweek around that same time.  He had already been performing and writing for a while, with a few albums out, and Somebody on High decided he was the next big thing.  It wasn‚Äôt due to talent.

        There is a huge blind spot in this essay: lifestyle. Even adults experience music differently due to the advent of technology‚Äôs impact upon how we live. Music used to be the one sense (just auditory) entertainment ‚Äì for centuries. With the rise of MTV, and now smartphones, music became just a background adornment. Most people put on music now as background, rather than an event.For we who play music, we know the idea of sitting in a room, listening intently, focusing exclusively on the music. Most don‚Äôt. And even adults who used to sit with buddies and sip a beer while listening to the new album no longer practice this exclusive attention to music.In short, music has become background, non-diegetic mood setting; it is no longer the main event.

            With classical music, to truly get what it has to offer, one has to listen actively. Having it play in the background while you heat up your Spaghetti-Os may be pleasant enough, but you‚Äôre barely scratching the musical surface. And that may be one reason why classical music is slipping into the abyss‚Äìit requires attention, effort, and a certain amount of intelligence to appreciate.

                As I learned more about classical music, I was stunned, in a positive way, by how much real intellectual effort and analysis is involved in much of it.  And those intellectual aspects often create and enhance the beauty, in areas like harmonies, counterpoint, etc.I‚Äôm very, very far from being a musical expert, but I wish that more people understood how rewarding classical music is.  A reasonable amount of working-class people used to understand this.  And it often used to be promoted in the early decades of TV!  Some Americans back then would yawn and scoff at the ‚Äúlong-hairs‚Äù of classical music, but at least it was reasonably supported once.

        I assumed that the Jews running the music industry decided they don‚Äôt want the kids listening to rock.
I do find it weird that rock is basically dead while country music is doing fairly well with young artists releasing new music.  I‚Äôve been to a couple of country shows, usually the act does a rock song or 2.  I think many of them would rather be making southern rock if there were still radio stations that would play that stuff.

        ‚ÄúTaylor Swift is probably the last mega star and her fame is mostly due to her general weirdness.‚Äù
TS found that maintaining even the schlockiest fake ‚Äúcountry‚Äù image was way too difficult in terms of peer pressure. Poof!  She quickly caved into the conformist‚Äôs ideal. Plus being a bureaucrat class worshipper pays far better. (She could be far worse of course, but reading her diary to some repetitive tones isn‚Äôt exactly musical genius.)
There seems to be some channeling of feminist anger these young ladies find instructive.

            Taylor Swift seems to have been molded for decades to be the perfect bugwoman. She started as a country star, got some fame, moved to NYC, started extolling the virtues of the city life instead of the hick country world, started getting pumped and dumped by prominent celebrities (both chad and bugmen), and then as soon as needed she was activated and started pushing for globohomo liberalism and abortion.

        Technology, hip hop, and lazy people made it easy to destroy popular music. The 60s/70s white pop or black soul/R&amp;B artists worked with excellent songwriters and excellent musicians did the recording sessions.Rap and disco put an end to that. AndPop was always different than Rock. Most rock bands had very good musicians even if they couldn‚Äôt read music. For the most part, the only modern musicians capable of reading music charts are horn sections, keyboard players and orchestras and it‚Äôs hard work and takes a long time to be proficient. Any idiot can make ‚Äúmusic‚Äù now.

                I wouldn‚Äôt go that far, but sometimes‚Ä¶ yeah. In any case, yes, black music used to be good. And then you had Ella Fitzgerald who wasn‚Äôt strictly speaking a ‚Äúblack music‚Äù singer. Her vocal range still amazes me when I listen to her stuff with Louis Armstrong.

                You‚Äôre right.  There used to be a lot of higher-quality black music, both with blacks doing their own thing, and blacks performing in more white genres.  Nat King Cole, Johnny Mathis, Charlie Pride, Motown‚Äìjust a few more examples.
Jazz was loaded with actual black talent, from the early days to around the 70‚Äôs or so.  We need to give them their due.

                    This is absolutely true. The black musical greats like Miles and Ella and Wynton Marsalis were great because they played music in white society using white instruments and white recording technology.
If their ancestors had never come here as slaves and they had been musicians in the Congo nobody would know who they were.

        I remember growing up in the 1980s and 1990s and rock, be it the Sunset Strip variety that became a self-parody or the heroin-fueled sludge from Seattle, ruled the roost. New bands popped up and became a part of your tape or CD collection.Cities had music scenes where musicians hoped to get the big break and get a record deal while playing dive bars and clubs. Now, it‚Äôs just shitty cover bands.Then rap became the predominant music, even for young whites. It‚Äôs just guttural, profane, rhythmic grunting over a looped drum beat without melody or substance. II grew up listening to hard rock and metal, especially Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Alice in Chains and Black Sabbath and now there are a few bands left, such as Black Label Society, still flying the banner.The 1990s stars all died from drugs either early in life (Layne Staley of Alice In Chains, and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana) or later (Chris Cornell of Soundgarden) and with the exception of Pearl Jam, won‚Äôt be touring in their 70s like their rock forebears.Music now is annoying pop and awful rap from gutter trash thugs. I am convinced Taylor Swift sold her soul to Satan to have her career, because her music and her voice are so dull. Everyone sounds pitch-perfect from autotune, but the effect has bled the soul of music.The music industry is like the movie industry. Both were once ruled by cartels and put out great product, but now in this atomized marketplace, they are struggling to stay relevant. I remember as a kid there were tons of great movies at the local cineplex, but now, you‚Äôre lucky if there are 1-2 movies per year for you to watch.In the Strain vampire books by Guillermo del Toro, the vampires take over the world and turn humans into slaves after killing ones that might resist their rule and bleeding (literally) the weak. On TV, they broadcast endless reruns as no more new content can be made. I read these books pre-COVID, but it sounds like how things are in the West today.

                I slightly disagree.
It‚Äôs possible for a cover band to be very talented, yet lack the creative spark to move to the next level with their own material.
I can think of one band in my area like this. Nationally, the band First 2 Eleven is an excellent example.
I find it a bit sad that these acts just can‚Äôt quite get to the next level.

                Clearly you‚Äôve never been in a bar with the Bangkok Beatles playing. They were pretty good on the early stuff. Or was it the beer? Been a while now.
Never could quite talk myself into paying money to see an Elvis impersonator though.

        From my perspective, a streaming service like Spotify is all I ever wanted from music. $10 a month for all the music I ever wanted to listen to, by anybody? What‚Äôs not to like? I used to have to spend that much on one LP or CD, and it often turned out I didn‚Äôt like 2/3 of the songs on it. If that‚Äôs tough on the record companies, that‚Äôs not my problem. But it turns out that the majority of what I listen to on spotify is 50 years old. Because‚Ä¶.‚ÄúRock‚Äù always had a limited life span, because it is a limited art form. There are only so many rhythms and chord progressions that can be used, from which if one wanders too far afield it‚Äôs not rock anymore. It becomes something else. Maybe jazz, which the average person has never been into. Truly, in the rock genre, everything that can be done has been done. It was already understood in my day, the late 1980s, that rock was dying, and that what came before was better. The advent of the whiner in place of the singer (personally I blame Michael Stipe) really sped this along. Next thing you know you had this Cobain who Xers pretend was talented to this very day.Negros used to make great music, but something happened to them with the advent of computer technology, and they stopped playing instruments and went with computerized noise instead. I don‚Äôt quite understand why, but happen it did. And it turned out the geeky white guys (DJs they call them) were generally a lot better at the computerized noise thing.

            Totally agree about Spotify.
As a late Xer it would have saved me hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars growing up.
I enjoy the, ‚ÄúDiscover Weekly,‚Äù playlist because the algo usually comes up with a couple good songs. Anything that doesn‚Äôt catch my ear in 30 seconds gets skipped, saving me immense time.

        My wife and I are musicians who play in a popular cover band around town.  The entire music community here is actually pretty right-leaning compared to what you might think, especially since the surrounding city is entirely shit lib.  On the subject of young people and live music, you are 100% spot on.  We are constantly arguing about what songs to play, or what type of music we need to cover to get people out.  The truth is, most of the people who come out are older.  They are the only ones who want to hear live music.  Your best bet is to play classic rock as that is what the demographic who comes to the shows wants to hear.  Young people don‚Äôt give a shit and they mainly come to consume their substances and hook up to a blaring DJ beat.

        I hate to say this, but this is one of those topics where our host, most of his readers, and even I show our ages. Basically, we sound like our parents did when we were young. Thus, it has always been‚Ä¶Like a lot of music enthusiasts, I get bored. I refuse to listen to ‚Äúclassic rock‚Äù stations, because I don‚Äôt want to hear the same songs I‚Äôve heard thousands of times before. Even stuff that I absolutely love, if I‚Äôve heard it too many times, I am only receptive to on rare occasions.I never go to nostalgia shows for that reason, but also because it‚Äôs usually sad to see old people doing the same exact schtick they‚Äôve done for decades. The only exception being the rare artists who either manage to evolve and stay interesting (Paul Weller), or have the chops to keep the old stuff interesting (Phish, and most other jam bands).As a result, I mostly listen to college radio and other ‚Äúindie‚Äù stations. And yes, most of it is fluff, nonsense or talentless dribble. BUT‚Ä¶ every once in a while something catches my attention. Then, I‚Äôll look up more of their material, or go to Youtube and watch a live performance, which has always been my ultimate way to judge.Believe it or not, there are still some very good artists out there, who are great both in studio and live. There are still a lot of kids learning instruments and writing great material. You just have to be willing to wade in and get dirty.The music industry has always been this way. While we remanence about the great music of our youth, it‚Äôs easy to forget all the horrible crap that was also very popular back then. Pick a time, any time, and go look at the Billboard charts. You‚Äôll see.

            Pro-tip.  Get a subscription to Pandora.  Put in a genre, then downvote every song you‚Äôve heard a million times.  You will find stuff you never thought of.

                Way back in the way back, when I worked in the music business during one of the last great Los Angeles music scenes (the Paisley Underground), I was a Commercial Music major in college. It was the ‚Äòbehind the scenes‚Äô stuff, focusing mostly on studio recording and live sound reinforcement. We learned and practiced using various mics, recording techniques, control room equipment, etc.  It was a great program that produced some well-known recording engineers and producers. Real working-man stuff.One of the required courses was ‚ÄúHistory and Appreciation of Music‚Äù. It was basically learning about classical music, starting with baroque and Gregorian chants, moving on through modern composers. It was taught in a large lecture hall with a professional sound system that was to die for. Learned to love so many types of classical music.

                    Took two music literature/appreciation courses as an undergrad, in part because they were supposed to be blow-off classes. At the time I had very little interest in classical. I can now honestly say those were two of the top-most classes I took in my college days, and that‚Äôs going all the way through doctoral work. Learned so much about classical music, and most important, I learned to love classical music. That will stick with me and provide solace for as long as I live.

            Nice to see a mention of The Phish From Vermont, who are still doing very in terms of ticket sales and are continually putting out new material to co-mingle with the old, some of better quality than others.Billy Strings, who recently sat in with Phish in his home state of Michigan in Grand Rapids, is the real freaking deal. Great guitar picker, singer and songwriter who has over the course of his career performed a staggering 500+ covers that can be enjoyed on a playlist on the streaming service nugs.net.He kept it going during the pandemic and has blown up big time in popularity. Selling out pretty big places ‚Äì arenagrass ‚Äì and keeping ticket prices reasonable. His fanbase covers a wide range, country to urban, left to right, old and young.Last month he bailed on his Renewal festival the day it started because Ms. Strings was in labor. There were fine musicians on the bill who took up the slack ‚Äì Molly Tuttle, Jerry Douglas and others ‚Äì but he gave every attendee a full refund. Total mensch.

        Once upon a time, young people adopted a music genre as a statement of who they were or aspired to be. It was an identifier, much like hair or clothing style, face piercings, or cultural jargon. It was how a person coming-of-age set themselves apart and created a public persona. Others could tell a lot about a stranger once they became acquainted with their music preference. And it worked because music resonates with an internal dimension of each person‚Äôs unique soul. It was authentic. It was a visceral bonding experience. We are worse off without it.

            Respectfully, I have to disagree. Before the world wars, and especially before World War II, most young people either didn‚Äôt have the time or the inclination to aggressively show that they belonged to some subculture, at least in the way they have since the 50‚Äôs. After WWII, and with the Baby Boom, the advertising world had a bonanza with promoting different youth subcultures. And with teenagers not having to work as much as before, and with their allowances from dad, they soaked that advertising up. Rock and all other forms of popular music are all a part of this, no matter how ‚Äúalternative.‚Äù In my reading of history, before the world wars in the West, lots of teenagers wanted to join the adult world around them, regardless of the tough responsibilities and dangers. ‚ÄúAdolescence‚Äù wasn‚Äôt such a thing. There was childhood, and then adulthood.Maybe some of this subculture stuff happened a lot in ancient Greece and Rome, and the Italian city states, but I don‚Äôt think it was to the degree that we have today, especially with people outside of the cities. Sorry, I keep using that manipulation word, but I think it‚Äôs key here, when talking about popular music, etc.

                Youth culture is a product of industrialization, mass market, and mass media. It emerged in the 1940‚Äôs and largely ended around 2010 for a variety of reasons. Youth culture is actually quite anomalous in the context of history.

        Like everything in post-America it is reliant upon the lowest common denominatorization of the magical people‚Äôs culture. It is also bent on pushing their so-called music everywhere. Just as the ads, show hosts, airport jobs are all geared toward worship of that one demographic, their music is pumped out of every soundhole in the imperium: airplanes; airports; rideshares; restaurants; cinemas; parking lots; supermarkets; bodegas; hardware stores; lobbies; retail counters (rental car, national park ‚Ä¶); bathrooms; ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶It is a pleasure and a relief to hear silence. I now own earplugs that I wear everywhere I go, and aside from the bill at restaurants, between the walls of TV screens pumping out magical people doing magical things and the incessant and loud so-called music, I am about ready to cut restaurants out entirely.They have written the soundtrack to The Total State.(One and TWO and Three and FOUR ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶) then weird highly affected nasal braying with profane Hallmark card lyrics or cloyed iambic pentameter pant hooting over the incessant count to four with an accent on two and four. Don‚Äôt forget that weird typewriter digital hi-hat and that boring bass note drone in the same pattern every time (bummmmm bum-bummmmmmmm). Don‚Äôt forget either that karaoke show vocal riffing that is a derivative of a derivative of a derivative of senseless noodling with no melodic contour or rhythm of interest.Hearing the rustle of the breeze through trees has become like magic to me.

        The root problem is the people aren‚Äôt interesting
A guy who was born in the back of a chevy and had a crazy drunken dad and left home at 16 on a rail car for the big city with a floozy on his side had something interesting to sing about.
What is someone like Nick Fuentes going to sing about?  Computers?  Coding a website?
I am in Florida now and I said as a joke but now I mean it, the wildlife and weather are more interesting than the people

            Not a bad point. Also, there are a lot of people who once dreamed of owning a radio station, I was one of them (thank God I didn‚Äôt go in that direction). The internet provides the perfect vehicle for these budding entertainers/entrepreneurs to do just that. But the rights fees are so obscene, someone in his basement loses money on the proposition. Then you have people with YouTube channels and podcasters that keep getting hit with copyright violations hurting their ability to monetize.Greed and inability to evolve to a more realistic model is another cause of them shooting themselves in the foot.

            Yes. Mrs W and I went to see Kenny Chesney at a football stadium recently and he sounded like he was playing in a dumpster. Added to the fact that the stadium itself is a large dumpster, it made for a very disappointing, expensive evening. Never again.

            Interesting take. Speaking of length, Stevie Nicks said that the original version of ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù is twenty seven minutes long. She also went on to add that it‚Äôs in a vault and that she‚Äôs not sure if it will ever be released, even after she‚Äôs gone. Too bad, that I‚Äôd love to hear.

                Hmm. I think the released ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù is plenty long. That said, what a weird and wonderful chick she was. Yeah, boomer nostalgia, but 1975‚Ä¶ I was fifteen: The struggle for my eternal devotion came down to: Nicks, Valerie Bertinelli, or Dorothy Hamill.The emergence of the transistor radio in the 1960s caused a revolution in the formation of young minds. Pop music became ubiquitous, a ‚Äúsoundtrack‚Äù of our youth. Listening to that stuff now reactivates memories, both large and trivial. For instance, Ringo Starr‚Äôs hit ‚ÄúIt Don‚Äôt Come Easy‚Äù reminds me of the day my little league team won the championship in 1971, The Eagles‚Äô ‚ÄúYou Can‚Äôt Hide Your Lyin‚Äô Eyes‚Äù commemorates the day my first girlfriend broke up with me in 1975. Van Halen‚Äôs ‚ÄúRunning With the Devil‚Äù recalls the afternoon I got high with some army buddies at Fort Rucker in 1979. ‚ÄúSmoke on the Water‚Äù by Deep Purple revives memory of the ice cream truck working our neighborhood in the summer of 1973. Loggins &amp; Messina‚Äôs ‚ÄúAngry Eyes‚Äù ‚Äì with its awesome base line putting my old Advent speakers to the test ‚Äì will always memorialize the first time I took a shower with my girlfriend*, again in 1979. And so on‚Ä¶At a guess, this is what millions of my generation experienced ‚Äì and continue to experience: The mind carrying thousands of these old pop songs, an army of possible ear worms, with associations that shape our memory. In my case, if for  some perverse reason I decided to write an autobiography covering 1967-1982, my primary source would be, in fact, the popular music of that time.*Who also broke up with me, with sadistic cruelty, later that year. Yep, there is a song recalling that too, in all its gory details: Billy Joel‚Äôs ‚ÄúHonesty‚Äù.

        My olderbrother (with whom I have not spoken in over 20 years) had/has literally thousands of LPs (his and our late father‚Äôs, rock/classical). Presumably worth a fair amount of money.

        Some of the best music comes from 60‚Äôs garage bands. These guys did this for fun and had small, local followings. Unfortunately, the Vietnam draft caused a lot of these bands to dissolve.
There are a few good modern songs, but most are commercial and boring. Rap music is torture, and a lot of Country Western is just silly. I can‚Äôt listen to Kenny Rogers while driving, I start nodding off and falling asleep.They should market his music for insomniacs.

        I have to respectfully disagree with the last paragraph.  I believe music from the 1960-90s period will live forever, because no one makes anything like it anymore.  Much like classical fans still listen to Bach/Mozart/Beethoven.  What choice do they have?I also wonder if much of the creativity of the golden era was a result of LSD.  Musicians just seemed to be in a different creative realm.  Now, much of popular music sounds like it was created by a corporate committee.  Computers give the ability to create complex combinations of chords, but the humans programming them can‚Äôt think of anything new.

            Bach/Mozart/Beethoven is the barest minimum of classical music. There are hundreds of other composers who are within shouting distance of the Big Three, and they produced tens of thousands of works. We don‚Äôt lack for choice; we‚Äôre spoiled for it.

Reread your article, replace covid with economic collapse, fixed it for you. Stop blaming covid, covid was hype, fear and the flu. Economy started to blow up late 2018, repo crisis late 2019, and on demand virus in 2020. Economy still sucks and nobody even thinks about covid anymore.

            And for music or enterntainment in general, people are sick of rich, mediocre hacks lecturing them on how to live life, who to vote for, and the god damn message they‚Äôve been sending in their media since 2016.

        Goethe wrote something that surprised me at that moment but I was able to see the truth of it ever afterward. ‚ÄúAll genius is provincial‚Äù. And although I don‚Äôt suppose he was thinking particularly of music it turns out to be very true, for example, of the great music of the 19th century, when both the compositions themselves and the perfomers were unique to their province and language, and easily idenfied. Edith Piaf would be an obviously French voice if she sang in German.With high tech came homogenization of language and culture. Accents disappeared. Genius could not percolate without isolation. The South remained provincial longer that the rest of America and it showed in literature and music. Even the Beach Boys were provincial, provincial Californians of a golden age.

        I‚Äôm 67 y/o. I saw most of the big mid 70s ‚Äì mid 80s rock acts. The only act i‚Äôve been excited about in decades is Billy Strings. One of the best live bands i‚Äôve ever seen. Their recorded stuff is OK ‚Äì pretty good, but live they are extremely good. As good as any band i‚Äôve ever seen.They‚Äôre classified as bluegrass but appeal to a wide range of musical tastes and ages. If you ever get a chance, go see them!!

        When I was a kid in the Fifties and Sixties, almost every song that came across the (ubiquitous) transistor was novel, and often extraordinary.  Now we get two choices: (c)rap, or waify politicized women warbling about how rotten men are.Who buys it?  The same demographic that dominates the (ruined) culture: teenage girls.The Fifties through Seventies WAS a golden age of music, and yes the music WAS that good, and tremendously diverse.  The (c)rap that rules now has not changed in forty years; it‚Äôs just the same rhythm and song recycled over and over again.  Like the waify feminist ‚Äòartists‚Äô, rap is essentially ideo-politics translated into song.  Predictably, it sucks.  Nobody cares because it‚Äôs not supposed to elevate or inspire.  It‚Äôs supposed to prove a point.  Agan, politics.P.S. a lot of groups, especially in their early phases, used session musicians out of L.A., S.F., or Muscle Shoals to lay down their studio albums‚Ä¶ including throughout the Sixties.  Probably The Section in L.A. was the go-to choice for West Coast studios.

        Great topic.  So many thoughts.  When I could download MP3s for free, I went crazy sticking it to the Man.  He had been sticking it to me for so many years, with one good song on an album of crap.  I haven‚Äôt paid for a recording since Kazaa.I‚Äôve been to countless concerts, but none since Covid.  Part of it is the old acts are all fading away.  Part of it is the missus and I are old and tired.  Most of the concerts we went to before the Cooties were full of gray hairs anywise.As far as what‚Äôs out there:  More than ever before and easier to access, and every bit as good, if you have any taste.  And all free.  If you aren‚Äôt a music executive, or a wanna be rock star, this is the golden age.BTW:  F the music executives.  The crap they have been feeding us since 1985 is pure garbage.  F them all to hell, the worthless parasites!

        I found a website last night that, for 10 bucks a month, generates a 3 minute song in whatever genre, with whatever lyrics, that you own a commercial license to.
People are already using this technology to create hour long mixes on YouTube. (Egyptian metal, bubblegum rock, folk calypso, etc.) There‚Äôs also at least one guy creating a fake pop-star account with the technology.
LLMs might just make the musician themselves obsolete.

                Ultimately, this might be a good thing. Performers will return to the relatively low status they enjoyed before mass media, and their product will be cheaper, and in some cases maybe better.
The likes of Taylor Swift should not be influential cultural icons, to say nothing of Diddy.

            Not just the musicians, but the record companies and recording studios as well. If the song you want can to hear can be synthesized for you from existing materials, most of the entire music industry becomes obsolete.
I guess it‚Äôs a mixed blessing. I‚Äôll never forgive the industry for forcing hip hop on everyone, when almost no one wanted it. Now, even country music is incorporating it.

        Being around young people because of my kids, I almost never hear them talk about going to a big concert. They will go to smaller events, music or otherwise. If they do go to a big concert, it‚Äôs an old act, like really old. They don‚Äôt have anyone from their generation that they seem to care much about.
But, again, smaller events are more popular than ever.

            But, again, smaller events are more popular than ever.You beat me to it. There has been a nationwide proliferation of small venues, and these tend to feature rock or country with their implicit masculinity and whiteness. Excellent music is being produced as a result. This is a true green shoot. The tickets tend to be quite inexpensive and kids actually socialize in meat space. In the old Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, the same happened prior to the communist implosion. I won‚Äôt claim those two were related directly (they may have been), but dissent often first manifests in popular culture.

                In my area, local music festivals have become very popular in the summer months. Most of the performers, while semi-professional (I.e., they have day jobs), are good, obviously enjoy themselves and bond easily with the audience. Off-site, the nearby bars will engage musicians as well, offering free admission to ticket holders for the main stage. It‚Äôs a lot of fun. Sure, my wife and I might drop $200 at one of these festivals, but it takes a whole afternoon of music, food and beverage to do so, as opposed to some large event with a big name act, where $200 barely gets the two of us inside the gate.

                The crowd at the Hammerfall/Sabaton show I saw was aggressively White and aggressively masculine (I saw one black guy and one asian woman).  I was one of the few oldsters (in my late 50s at the time).  And everyone mingled, knew all the lyrics and sang along enthusiastically.  I jumped around with the best of them, as much as possible given the crowd and tight space.

            Smaller music venues sell tickets for shows for $20-$30, it‚Äôs more intimate, the acoustics are better, the booze is cheaper, it‚Äôs easier to get in and out of, etc. Yes the music is different, but ultimately you‚Äôre paying for an experience, even if you never heard of the band, if your friend likes them maybe you find something good you never would have thought of. And for $20, even if the band stinks, it‚Äôs a few hours out.The Black Keys got egg on their face earlier this year for canceling their tour due to low sales, while I like Black Keys, I can‚Äôt imagine spending triple-digits to see them under any circumstances.

                I could never imagine spending triple digits to be packed in like a sardine in uncomfortable chairs to see anyone ever. It‚Äôs not as if that‚Äôs the only way to hear the music. Obviously a lot of people see it differently. In my youth it was more like $15 and that was justifiable in a town where there wasn‚Äôt much else happening on Friday night.

        Late on this, but it is not (mostly) technology. But Demographics. I did a post years ago, on my old site, and I looked at the number of young White men available to form bands, patronize clubs, and make a semi-living (not real one). That peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Which is precisely when you saw bands like X, the Blasters, the Ramones, the Bangles, the Clash, Devo, Wall of Voodoo, etc, form in places like London, New York, and Los Angeles.The formula was: ‚Äúenough‚Äù critical mass to where bands can play in dive places and get some experience and exposure, in turn driven by ‚Äúenough‚Äù late HS / early College kids forming bands: examples include REM, Devo, Talking Heads, the Replacements. All formed by a couple of dudes in HS or early College. That was the start, the farm system sort of for musical development. Not being corporate led or driven there could be a 100:1 ratio of bands attempted, and those which formed and had enough success to have some sort of record deal and touring.In turn, this ecosystem depended on enough young White people who wanted to dance to their own music to play cheap, and available venue where the opposite sex could be met and impressed. This in turn depended on ‚Äúenough‚Äù young White listeners of College radio and local alternative rock to know where and when bands they heard on the radio would be playing.There was never a lot of money in it, which is why it escaped for some time the corporatism that smothers creativity and spirit. But there was enough young White people until the end of the 1980s to support this. Its telling that the very last gasp of White rock music was the depressing Seattle sound full of rage and discontent.People are not going to stop making music, but the sort of ‚Äúmini-mass‚Äù where you would get Devo on Letterman being the Whitest and most Motown band ever, at the same time (watch the old stuff on Youtube, they were on Letterman multiple times and their performances were in-sync spot on and ultra tight in timing and utterly, utterly White), that is not happening again.Swift? In five years she‚Äôll be on the Voice like Katy Perry or Gwen Stefanie. Its notable that Lady Gaga‚Äôs Joker 2 Album flopped, lowest sales ever for her. She is of course a corporate creation, but started out with Daddy‚Äôs money like Lana Del Rey. Just more successful.

        I gave away my LP‚Äôs years ago, the cassettes are worn out and I really don‚Äôt need the cd‚Äôs when I can go on YouTube and listen to just about anything plus see them perform for free. ‚Äî  I know of a local band of young guys that does quite well playing 50‚Äôs -60‚Äôs songs to the Boomers.  My class reunion had them and it wasn‚Äôt all that bad but it was a long, long, really long way from actually being young and electrified by that music.

        I‚Äôm baffled as to why Swift is so popular. She must‚Äôve sold her soul to Satan.
Last good concert I attended was Porcupine Tree at the MGM Fenway a few years (!) ago. Not too big or small, and even has a skybar that overlooks Yawkey Way.

        I don‚Äôt know much about the music industry but, with the availability of recorded music, new music has to compete with already-produced music that listeners can access according to their own tastes.  Insofar as concerts are concerned, aside from the ‚Äúcrowd experience,‚Äù why listen to several hours of songs when you can get the ones you like on Yourube or other platforms? I remember hearing Al Stewart (Year of the Cat,Time Passages) complaning about the lack of sales.

        Just bring up again the conversation I had with a local who remarked that her grandson got to go see Tool.  WTF, like the same so-so act from whenIwas in high school?  Yes, the young people‚Äôs dream act is a whose best song was released before decades before they were born.Just to expound upon your technology point.  Even for ‚Äúnormal songs‚Äù in the modern era a close listen will reveal heavy mixing, i.e., the only way the music could possibly be played live is with a lightening quick guy working the mixing board.  Industrial Karaoke is much easier (and cheaper).

                    There was a blogger about 10-15 years ago who followed youth culture. He said that youth culture as a separate distinct sub-culture, died around 2010. I don‚Äôt remember the reasons he cited as to why. But this is the reason why they no longer have their own aesthetic. This is also likely the reason why Taylor Swift is so popular.

                I‚Äôve read that the Ramones won the young-person-tee-shirt lottery, which is odd for a one-joke band, but they won for graphic design, not for music. Old hipsters love to ask the youngsters what their favorite Ramones song is, which is a bit cruel.

                    For as long as there have been Ramones, Misfits, and Nirvana shirts, they‚Äôve signified not listening to those bands.Sonic Youth was the last to become that kind of nonmusical icon, years after everyone but musicians forgot them. The first generation of camwhores‚Äîthe internet‚Äôs first great ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù‚Äîhad a lot of Kim Gordon fangirls in it.And Burzum, favorite of teenagers who lightly cut themselves. The erasure of the Burzum shirt from the ‚Äúhipster‚Äù wardrobe‚Äîresult of a total corporate alliance against average metal nerds, backed by a campaign of antifa violence‚Äîis a better date for the Great Awokening‚Ñ¢ than anything that happened on TV. I‚Äôm sure Sailer noticed it.

                        Sailer likes to recount when he saw the Ramones and Talking Heads in the 70s before they got big.  I don‚Äôt blame him.  I bet those were exciting shows.
Goad likes to recount the fights he got into with anti-racist punks in Portland in the 90s for wearing an iron cross.

                No. It is the new irony t-shirt without the first sense of irony. Upper middle class teen girl is dying to fill herself with angst. She loves Kurt Cobain and Nirvana as it is bottled angst that was real that she can accumulate. Same girl hates white men and calls them privileged.Girl doesn‚Äôt realize that Cobain, Staley, Cornell ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ were young white men from working class Seattle filled with the angst of being dispossessed by environmentalists, off-shoring, civil rights regime and mourning the onset of the anti-white longhouse of post-modern post-America ‚Ä¶Girl puts on her Nirvana t-shirt, feels the high of the angst as she cranks some Nirvana as she drives off in her car with a BLM sticker on her way to her abolish whiteness studies and end white privilege class as she flips off the one house that remains flying an American flag. Wait until she is 50 and a despised minority with no prospects and sympathy.

        It‚Äôs interesting to look at downloads of songs from the pre streaming era.
A lot of songs that were never hits have a lot of downloads and a lot of songs that were hits have not as many as you expect.
So you can kind of see what aged well and what didn‚Äôt. Anyone remember new jack swing? It aged terribly

        Most of the ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù performers were actually lefties before they became musicians, unlike today, where performers are lefties because it‚Äôs a requirement to be allowed into what remains of the game. These days, the energy that would go into the creative endeavour is instead channelled into the two minutes hate from an early age.

            Before rock, lots of performers were very patriotic at least, and today would be cancelled for their views.  Elvis was thrilled to meet Nixon in the 70‚Äôs.  And, maybe outside of the Rat Pack, lots of big names hated the socially liberal crap.

        One of the oddities I noticed while watching Kids in the Hall was how much more significant popular music was to Gen Xers compared to Millennials.  I‚Äôm not sure it was mp3 torrenting that killed pop music as much as simply a more compelling form of entertainment arose in the form of video games.

        I read just the opposite earlier this week ‚Äì that live music is enjoying a resurgence. The author was a jazz writer so he was looking at jazz venues but I think this holds for all sorts of out-of-mainstream music genres. Pop music has been splintering into all sorts of sub-genres for decades, and I think we have so many people now that don‚Äôt care for the  mainstream crap that real alternative musicians are finding an audience.

        Lurking in the background off stage or in the studio are the gatekeepers and minders who manipulated musicians who sold their souls to try to get a few minutes of stardom. The 8√ó10 glossies of old got supplemented by the incriminating videos showing just how far people would go make a buck.Do this or else. Takes away from the purity of artistic creation.Music is part of the larger entertainment world, now experiencing its own revelations.

        As I await for approval, I do think we will see lots of stuff over Youtube. There will be artists, performing, that most people will never have heard of, but do have fans. They will play at impromptu venues, make halfway decent money, and make a middle class living off mostly streaming revenues.I have heard the various AI-driven stuff, like Sinatra singing Pixies songs, though the most popular is not AI but a real guy singing. Just as the most famous Bruce Springsteen parody (singing the Flintstones theme) is not AI but a real guy, including Springsteen-isms of talking/singing intros.

        I‚Äôm a dead fan, although I don‚Äôt listen to much rock. Think about this, and I know they got rich, but it‚Äôs typical white man conscientiousness . They played  perhaps over a thousand shows. Maybe more. Could one of them not have shown  up? No. They all had to be there more or less on the ball. There‚Äôs no not feeling like going into workAnd all of it‚Äôs from memory. A rotation of I think at least 125 songs that they had at their fingertips. Sure they did those long jams but still it‚Äôs non joke it‚Äôs not like that great dire straights song money for nothin. It‚Äôs not really nothing it‚Äôs a lot of work!https://youtu.be/0ZmR-T0jilA?si=GONT7UlxfykpXJHZ

            I‚Äôm gonna say that by the time Jerry died they had played at least 5000 shows. And I think that‚Äôs a lowball conservative estimate.

                The Grateful Dead played about 2300 concerts. It‚Äôs a weird thing to consider that almost as much time has passed since Jerry died as the duration of the band. The band was founded in 1965 and Jerry died in 1995 and in some way more popular than ever. Same deal as Nirvana etc. with young folks sporting their merch who may or may not actually be fans of the band.Coincidentally, today is not only the 77th birthday of Bob Weir but also the 47th birthday of John Mayer, the one-time pop star with a blues background who has been the faux Jerry of the most current post-Jerry incarnation called Dead and Company. A nostalgia act certainly but with more younger fans than one might think. Their 24 show run at Sphere in Las Vegas was positively triumphant. I went once and it was big although pricey fun.They were in many ways the quintessential American band. They drew from all American genres: rock, blues, funk, disco, country, folk, bluegrass, jazz and even modern classical and world music and melded them into a sound all their own. And as a touring act they provided an American road adventure for those who followed them around.As musicians they were no joke. Especially in the 1971-74 period where Bill Kreutzmann was the only drummer ‚Äî Mickey Hart, the only tribesman in the band, went on hiatus because his father Lenny absconded with a large chunk of funds ‚Äì the song He‚Äôs Gone is about that. During this period, which happens to be the height of jazz fusion, their collective improvisational prowess was and remains unparalleled. It wasn‚Äôt Jerry noodling over a backup band, it was a musical conversation among equals.They completely revolutionized the music business with their DIY ethic, allowing fans to tape their concerts, varying their setlists night to night, etc. and were hugely successful as a touring act while bucking the trends of the industry. Without intending to do so they invented the whole jamband genre, of which Phish is the most successful and known but there are many others with their own spin, some veterans, some newer such as Goose, that are doing quite well.

        They got greedy when they migrated away from 45‚Äôs and started forcing you to buy albums with one or two songs you wanted to hear and the rest of them being unlistenable crap. Then there is all of this unnecessary copyright protection that is nothing more than a pain in the rear.Rule One for any business: If you make it difficult for customers to acquire and consume your product, people end up not wanting to mess with you at some point in time.Then you have the death of local radio. Everybody used to complain about the DJ‚Äôs claiming they wanted more music. I think the current state of radio proves that was very wrong. People want to be entertained. They want immediacy, they want someone there with them.

            I have satellite radio and a few older songs I know immediately are ‚Äúremasters‚Äù when I hear them. The most recent one I heard this morning was ‚ÄúAnnies song‚Äù from John Denver. The vocals just aren‚Äôt right, they sound flat and without emotion. On the other hand, they occasionally get one right. Case in point is ‚ÄúJust a job to do‚Äù from Genesis. I have the original lp and I‚Äôve also listened to the remastered version and with the latter, you can really hear the ‚Äúdetail‚Äù in the guitar and bass work versus the lp. YMMV.

            I‚Äôm with you, although I‚Äôm not always sure who was doing the manipulating.
All it takes is to look at the crowds in video footage of 70‚Äôs concerts to see that these young people were being led by the nose.  All the while thinking that they were Cool, and no one would tell them what to do.  And that includes Punk.  It‚Äôs very pathetic.
And I admit, I was in some of those crowds.
