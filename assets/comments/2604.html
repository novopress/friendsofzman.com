        When I went over to Germany to help set up a chemistry lab, i.e., make sure they knew what they were doing, I discovered that they train very specifically in their schools. Their graduates know how to use their training very well. Americans, though, I figured out at the time, learn the basics, then OJT teaches us, those who succeed, how to really do our jobs.Some of the German analytical guys were fantastic. Nailed every analytical procedure and gnarly problem. Others, PhDs, could not get past their schooling, and insisted on doing the same things they were taught, the same way, regardless of the erroneous results, and insistent that their German solvents were the “best in the world” – though solvent contamination and degradation was their main problem. Could not convince the dumb ones. Smart ones got it, right away, and changed their methods.That said…I have a friend graduated with a Marketing degree after he got out of the Army in the 70’s. Went into carpentry and has been doing it, ever since.
