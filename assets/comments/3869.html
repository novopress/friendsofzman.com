Nothing American is even comparable to the Miata, the 3rd gen RX7, or the VFR800. Erik Buell is a great man, but you said “open road”, not “track”.
Has there ever been an American car with acceptable handling? I drove an early ’00s Mustang and it was basically a small minivan. Nothing an enthusiast would waste money on.
I wish it weren’t true, but there’s no use lying to ourselves. If you think Japanese cars and bikes lack “character”, it’s Europe, Buell, or nothing.

            There’s a difference between handling and road feel. The higher end versions of Mustangs, Camaros, Cadilacs and SRT’s put up track numbers comparable to their relevant competition. America is not a compact country with lots of narrow, winding roads. As a result, cars built for those streets are not going to be as popular as those built for long straightaways. Then there is the whole road feel side of things. A proper British sports car feels like a go-cart. It’s low, light, springy and great for darting around country roads with the top down. A proper Italian sports car is great to look at while you wait for the tow truck. The proper American sports car has the low end acceleration and torque that causes your head to slam into the headrest.My own tastes alternate between the British and American tastes. Yeah, that aesthetic lacks the art of the Italians and the engineering prowess of the Germans, but that’s why the English speaking people have dominated the world for 300 years.

        People that cite “Consumer Reports” opinions on automobiles are always quite satisfied in their own  ignorance of the subject.
If you’re happy driving a refrigerator or washing machine, a Jap-car will do nicely.
If, however, you enjoy the excitement and freedom of the open road, American V8 muscle is the only game in town.

        The building of automobiles to a high standard is about two things, insane dedication to both engineering and quality control, and non-union labor.

        Nonetheless a gap still exists. Japanese  brands are at the tophttp://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/800×450/format/jpg/quality/85/http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2010/10/cr-best-worst-2010.jpg

American reliability is only slightly worse than European, but still significantly worse than Asian

            All Hondas sole in the US are built in the US now. Almost all Toyotas. Mercedes and BMW have brought a lot of production to the US.

        “foreign cars are more reliable than American brands.”
????
Unless that’s a 1987 Chrysler LeBaron parked in your driveway……the gap has narrowed significantly.

        idk about the last part. foreign cars are more reliable than American brands. also imports must meet the same standards as domestic. food poisoning outbreaks happen all the time with American brands, like the infamous Jack in the box outbreak in 1993.
