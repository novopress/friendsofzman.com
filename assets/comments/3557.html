        There is no perfect candidate.  So vote for the one with the whitest skin?  I don’t know, the darkie has been a disaster so lets go blond next time around and see what happens.  Other than that, I got nothing.

        It seems you don’t like any of the candidates except for perhaps Ted Cruz?

            I have not thought much about the candidates, other than Bush and Rand Paul. The national question is a litmus test issue for me. I’m generally pro-immigration in that I think we can handle a million or so legal immigrants. I favor wholesale reform of our immigration system and draconian laws regarding illegal immigration. Any candidate spouting romantic notions about immigration is a non-starter for me. That just tells me they have not thought about the issue and have no interest in learning it.I look at gun control the same way. If you know anything about guns, you have no use for gun control. That means any candidate favorable to gun control is either stupid, lazy or crazy. Homosexual marriage is another litmus test issue, but national candidates can be forgiven for dodging it. It should not be a national issue anyway.

        The scion is usually, though not always, a dilution of the parent. Anything that smacks of dynasty is antithetical to a democratic republic. No more Bushes. No more. I’ve said it before, I will not vote for Jeb under any circumstance. I will not, and I don’t even think he’s the anti-Christ.
