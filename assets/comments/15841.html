        Massive credit creation and money pumping is not a solution for societal ills any more than massive immigration is.
Bernanke didn’t “fix” a goddam thing.

            Really surprised that Z characterized the TARP bailouts, QE and runaway debt creation this way. Disappointing honestly.

                It was the only way to stop a freezing of the credit markets…by which we all survive under.  Don’t confuse the rightness of the action at the right time with the untenable position our government has placed us in…

                    They should have been allowed them to freeze, and then we could have fixed the problem. You’ve confused the role of government. The government is not an actor in these affairs, but a referee. You can make the argument that if the government had did it’s job then the crisis would never have happened, and I agree, but once it happened they had one role. They should have overseen the collapse and the clean up.

            Never wrote anything to the contrary. That said, we did not have a collapse of the banking system, a great depression and massive civil unrest that would have been the result. From the point of view of the people in charge, that was a good result. Most normal people probably think it was a good result too.

                Agreed.’08-’09 was a systemic financial crisis, i.e. the bank system was close to collapse. That’s about as bad as it gets, and Bernanke and company stopped the train from going over the cliff.I disagree with many of the ways that they stopped the train (and what they did afterward), but they did stop it. We were very close to short-term credit drying up and that means businesses all over the country shutting their doors. That would have led to very bad things.Personally, I would have preferred that the fed did an orderly bankruptcy of the big banks instead of bailing many of them out and taking a lot of their debt onto the backs of taxpayers. (The fed also nursed them back to health with low interest rates on the backs of savers and taxpayers.) But it’s easy to say that from the comfort of my living room. In the middle of the battle, you have a different view.

                    But wouldn’t that have meant the FDIC would have been on the hook for billions in wiped-out deposit accounts? What seems to be the likely result of a TARP 2.0 will be a bail in, as already happened in Malta, that I know of, and perhaps Greece as well.

                        No.  The assets of the failing bank , e.g. Bank of America, would be taken over by a stronger bank such as Wells Fargo.The shareholder and bond holders of the failed banks would have their values zeroed out and many of the employees would be on the street.But the depositors would have been o.k.  Assuming the FDIC was supported by the Government, which would be easy for them to do, just by moving digits around in cyberspace.If I recall, the Europeans did not have an FDIC-like entity at the beginning of the crisis but rushed to create one.

                            Exactly. What should have been a crisis for the elites became a crisis for the average. The government protected the interests of the elite class and let the masses face the repercussions. You lost your house but they didn’t lose their interest in the financial institutions.

                        Nobody ever at any time intended to pay it off. That’s the system itself. I don’t mean simply that that’s how it works. I mean that’s what it *is*. Debts are “serviced,” yes, but payoff–that is not intended.

                Are you sure about that?  If Goldman Sachs and a few others went under would it have collapsed the entire banking system, or would it only have been that certain elites would have lost a lot of money?

                    The credit system was on the verge of collapse. Whatever the merits of a credit based economy, the credit markets freezing would have been like the power grid suddenly failing. Just as you cannot have a modern world without electricity, you cannot have this modern world without the free flow of credit and capital inside the financial system. Think of the credit system as the gyroscope of the modern society.That does not mean the “solution” was a great idea or even a solution. it just means the fed stopped the system from collapsing and taking the rest of us with it.

                        There sure wasn’t a lot of credit for new construction. I couldn’t find a job as a field engineer on a large project, my bread and butter, for 3, yes 3 years. The unemployment was extended thankfully, but was only 25% of what I was making. When I finally got a job on a new project the pay was one quarter less than before. Tough times indeed.

                        what does the average person have? A job and maybe a house and a couple of vehicles? We could have gotten by in make shift shelters eating MREs. Our lives could have gotten back on track in a few years. The elite class had something to lose. They had fortunes and institutions, and that’s what the government sought to protect. Everything the government did in the 2009 crisis was done to protect the interests of the elite.

                    Many, many businesses run on short-term credit. Gas stations, grocery stores, even small manufacturing. Shut down that credit and they shut their doors. That would have caused massive unemployment, massive panic and who knows what else.
Sure, in a few months, new credit suppliers would have sprung up, but the chaos caused in the interim could have sunk the economy to the point of a depression.
Yes, Bernanke saved the bacon of a lot of rich people, but he also avoided a depression. Not saying I agree with exactly how he did it, but he did do it.

                        A “depression” is nothing more than a recession that lingers. Recessions clear out excess exuberance and bad investment decisions made with borrowed money. Properly handled, they actually make us stronger and wiser. Propping up a corrupt banking elite only put off the day of reckoning. It has enabled the profligate, the criminal, and the foolish.

                            True. But there’s a lot of collateral damage as well.
The fed’s failure was not discharging the debt in the right way. Investors should have taken the haircut, not taxpayers. (The fed move the bad debt to its books.) I would have preferred an orderly bankruptcy of the Wall Street banks. But that’s easier said than done.

The majority of the people experienced a depression (and many still are today) The top line definition of a depression was avoided by the creation of digital money given to the .01% and with which they expanded their control and ownership of the counties real (as opposed to paper) assets.

                TARP was a failure in that it protected the elites that brought on the disaster (yes that protection was a success in their own eyes).  The system needed structural reform, including a purging of those running it, as happened previously in the US and more recently in other countries.

                Bank credit massively collapsed. What are you talking about? US citizens and residents lived under a 16 year economic depression.
You didn’t know about it because it was papered over by a doubling of cash into circulation and a massive uptake in foodstamps and other welfare.

                You’re surely right on both counts. The problem for me and many others who read your posts is that I (we) believe that the people in charge are destroying Western civilization and I (we) want them stopped. If economic collapse is the cost of stopping them, then I (we) believe that it we have to bear it. That’s perhaps a mad position, but the actions of the people in charge have driven me (us) into madness.

                    Actually, your position is the most sane and clear – and I kind of agree. (I wouldn’t have in 2008-09, but I do now.)
If it makes you (and me) feel any better, the fed and Congress are going to have a lot less ammunition to fight the next downturn than they did the last one. One the downside, it doesn’t look as though the next downturn will be systemic financial crisis, so it’s unlikely the we’ll be looking at a depression/society changing event. But who knows.

Step up to the plate, slugger. Put your big boy pants on.The Fed’s “peaceful path forward” from 2008 – the “good result” for which we should thank Mr. Bernanke for his guidance and wisdom, is exactly why the economy is about to crash and burn in a hard landing an order of magnitude more disruptive than 2008’s private equity leverage crisis.We now have an everything bubble, a sovereign debt crisis, and ultimately, a currency crisis about to unfold. Time will tell of course and you can venture back in a year or five to tell me I was wrong. In the meantime, I can rely on you to be clear-eyed on race-realism and culture but by God you’re naive on economics. Maybe illiterate.

                        We haven’t had a serious deflationary episode since the great depression. That’s part of the system design. The people/banks controlling the Fed would rather slit their own throats.
You can make an argument that a major deflationary episode would be a welcome clarifying moment, but the financial elites will do everything in their power, including confiscating your savings and throwing babies into woodchippers, to prevent that.

                    It’s also to prevent hyper deflation. It tries to ride on the cutting edge of mild, consistent inflation.
Over a matter of decades, the hidden tax on savings benefits investors over savers and encourages consistent monetary velocity, while slowly devaluing debt (notably, government debt).
Nobody swims in vaults full of cash a la Scrooge McDuck, because the system is designed to make it impossible to preserve wealth in that manner.
Not to say that it is a good system, but that’s what it’s intended to do.

                        The system is designed to allow the government to produce a near unlimited amount of money out of thin air, and later that debt disappears back into thin air.  It’s all designed to facilitate government spending. The illegal drug trade has dollarized all of South America and the government gets to spend that money into existence. Economic, monetary and financial policy is all focused on that one goal.

                    You don’t know what you’re talking about. The “very design” of the monetary system is to prevent bank runs due to maturity transformation and fractional reserve. That is why the fed/FDIC exists. Inflation literally doesn’t enter into the equation.The one and only reason America’s debt has not already caused hyperinflation is that foreign countries are willing to hold American dollars and bonds as a reserve currency. It’s founded on sand. If that balance shifts even slightly, liquidity disappears and inflation will skyrocket – unless austerity is imposed, in which case it will be massively deflationary.The one thing it *isn’t* is stable. Inflation and deflation aren’t opposites the way some people think. They’re both part of the boom-bust or business cycle.

                        The US dollar is the reserve currency and the need for stability will trump any economic rationality. Back a decade ago the state of California handed out IOU’s and banks took them even though they were not required too.The USG can do the same ad infinitum and truth be known you’ll be dead of old age long before a collapsequoth KeynesThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solventTruth is hoping for a collapse is just a variant of the rescue scenario, someone, something will come along and save us.Well no it won’t. YOU not the other guy YOU or your descendants  are going to  have to fix things. Right now we have a small window to make the system work and its still worth trying, Please don’t go do stupid illegal things.Eventually though its going to come to serious matters and instead of  buying guns and ammo  it will be using them.The window may open or it may have to be pried open.What will you suffer for and what do you want enough to suffer excruciating pain for. When you figure that out, you can have itTill than, keep calm and carry on.

            Bernake and company actually did save the world.  There were (and are) institutions too big to fail, in the sense that their failure would lead to societal collapse and widespread misery.  The bad debt was just too big for any entity (or group of entities) but the Fed to hold.We just replicated the strategy that central bankers have often used successfully before, for example with the various sovereign debt crises.  Freeze the debt, rebuild the credit and strength of private institutions,  then do an orderly liquidation with prudent haircut losses.The costs to the system are both lesser and more manageable.Central banking is a real thing and if done well much better than the bad old days of hard money.  It’s not difficult but it does require both courage and honesty.  Volker and Bernake had that.  Greenspan (who with the Mrs. loved to party with the other Cloud People) didn’t.The real problem was letting the institutions get too big to fail in the first place.  That would require political action for which we can no longer reasonably hope.  The 2016 Republican platform called for returning  Glass Steagel.  No one serious believed  it would happen.  It didn’t. Since we didn’t learn from disaster I guess we’ll need to move on to Catastrophy.

And it’s for our own good.  Seems too convenient for them.  I flunked out of law school and nobody’s paying off the debt of MY mistakes…

            Nor is it suggested he did. He maneuvered the country to a softer landing hy providing a lot of liquidity to the markets.  Keep in mind that the government’s incompetence in goosing the housing market with loose mortgages is what precipitated the crisis.I expect the next crisis will also have the government’s fingerprints on it…

        France is already there. It is bankrupt and cannot pay the jizya to Muslims and Africans. Hence the Green diesel taxes leaving middle and working class Whites including cops with the choice of fuel to go to work or food. And no social welfare for them.It was never about Green virtue signaling. It was about a money grab to pay off the diverse.France cannot simply print francs as they are in the Eurozone. They currently run a massive deficit which Italy points to in its battle with the EU and Jean Claude Juncker over its budget deficit.The only way to pay for the diverse is some form of slavery or serfdom for 90% of Whites.That is the crisis.

            France’s deficit is only a little over 3% of gdp while it’s debt to gdp is ~100%, which isn’t great but not horrible. France’s problem is that that taxes as % of gdp is nearly 50%. (The U.S. is 25%.) France has run out of room to tax its people – and by people, I mean white people so you’re right.It can’t increase its deficit and the ethnic French are already taxed to death. France can no longer paper over the transfer or money from whites to blacks and Muslims. Whites are refusing to be taxed more but blacks and Muslims will riot if the gov’t tries to cut back on their welfare.

        For a long time I’ve been an occasional reader of “The Housing Bubble Blog,” where each day news about the real estate market is posted, along with a lively comments section.
Prior to the bubble bursting a decade ago, the commenters there clearly saw it coming, and would ridicule the euphoric “real estate always goes up” investors, and instead looked at basic fundamentals such as median income’s relation to housing prices, and mortgages for anyone with a pulse, supply and demand, etc.
Today the chatter at the blog is sounding the same as it did back then.

            It seems like there is a major financial crisis every ten years, since deregulation was put into play.  Late 80s savings and loan, late 90s dot com bubble, 2008/9 housing bubble.  We are exactly due for a crisis, heuristically speaking.  It would almost seem that we are systemically being fleeced.  Each decade, a new cohort builds up a retirement that we are forced by these gov 201k and tax shelters to put into the abstract financial market.  Then the liquid assets are deflated by means of some leak in the system, housing, nasdaq, somewhere.  I’m not claiming(nor excluding) that this is conspiratorial, but perhaps a flaw in the system.

                the 19th century had  bank crisis after bank crisis caused by liquidity issues.
Fiat currency and later regulation  helped alleviate that
The optimum solution would have been to allow basically no immigration and move to a bimetalism but this would have meant much less corporate profits and as such big business let teh US get flooded with migrants
History may not repeat but it does rhyme

            Unfortunately, part of the problem with investing and financial planning is that being early is the same as being wrong. Many people predicted the crunch, but had no idea when it would happen or exactly what conditions needed to be in place to trigger it.It’s easy to say that winter is coming, but most people won’t listen unless you tell them the date and time of the first snowfall. They’re not entirely wrong to do so, either; it would be just as silly for us to listen to the climate alarmists when they haven’t made any accurate predictions in decades.

        The house the old man grew up in is located near the old Douglas plant and offices not far from LAX. In today’s dollars, based on what my grandparents paid for it during the war, it should cost about $130,000.00. It recently sold for $990,000.00. Based on the tried and true 2.5 times your annual income being the max house you can afford, the person that purchased that home needs to make damn near $400,000.00 annually. Any bets on whether the people that bought that home make even half of that? Medicine, education, and housing are controlled by the federal, state, and local governments. Medicine, education, and housing are responsible for almost all of the inflation, and subsequently the debt in the United States. Who controls the debt?What we should be seeing is real world deflation. The costs of goods, in REAL terms, falling over time due to efficiencies and technologically advances. We’ve seen it in food, and we’ve seen it in consumer goods. We are about to see it in medicine, education, and housing.

            Money pumping and inflated values of everything is what underlies the globohomo order and supports it financially.
The fact that people who criticize the end result of the globohomo order and it’s effects on white society apparently have no comprehension of the financial mechanics that undergirds the clouds and holds them up – is seriously disappointing – to say the least.
It’s also a good indication that nobody is coming to save you.  Despite all the flowery language and high sounding analysis.

                It takes about four years after a currency collapse for another stable system to be put in place. In other words, you’d better have a plan to survive four years without access to the old currency…which will be inflated away to nothing. Best bets are land, stocks in vital companies like oil refining or power production, and precious metals.

        There is of course a great deal of educated commentary here about things like monetary and financial policy.  These things are insightful if you are an expert working inside the machine, but it’s a little like asking a jet-engine mechanic what he does: he’ll give you a detailed description of various engine maintenance techniques, but an eight-year-old boy intuitively knows that what this guy really does is, he helps Grandpa fly from Chicago to Mom’s house for Christmas.Similarly, if you asked a neutral space alien what is wrong with the U.S. economic situation, he’d say something like this…1.  The dollar was a very strong instrument long before Bretton Woods or reserve currency status or petrodollar status.  It was not uniquely supreme, it was rivaled by the pound sterling and other instruments.  But in say 1890, you bet your bippy the dollar was a swingin’ mofo.2.  The reason the dollar was so strong was not because it was backed by gold or oil.  The dollar was backed by a giant population of smart, healthy, sane, well-fed,  capable, energetic Christian White people, among the most inventive and industrious people in human history, who as luck would have it lived in a continent-sized fortress bounded by oceans on two sides.  Abundant land, natural resources, a people smart and capable enough to steward all this stuff effectively, a lack of too many crazy historical feuds, and pretty much impossible to invade from outside.  America was Europe without the crazy wars, and without the geographical trap doors leaving it vulnerable to predatory Islam and Asian and African hordes.  America was quite literally the safest, richest place on Earth.  THAT is what upheld the dollar.  All you had to do to keep this scam running, was control your negroes sensibly and keep out the oceans of Latino paupers.3.  Naturally it didn’t take long until, somewhere on the other side of the planet, a bunch of Jews noticed this setup and cried out, “CHA-CHING!!”  Frantic high-speed hand-rubbing and cash-register sound effects promptly commenced.4.  The next thing you knew, the money supply was controlled (at INTEREST!) by these people, a byzantine income tax and its very own crazy secret police force had been yoked upon the people, the courts, the press, the universities and the broadcast media were all (((in private hands))), the country was driven into (((endless debt))) to pay for the privilege of sending its own sons to die in foreign wars for the benefit of foreign people.  And all the hard assets were being hoovered up for imaginary “money”.   Not bad for only about 100 years’ worth of patient scheming.5.  The American (white, Christian) basis for value was production and distribution.  The Jewish basis for value is arbitrage, debt slavery, extortion and rent-seeking.  Anything to avoid actually having to go into the shop and build a jet engine.  The economy is now almost fully financialized rather than rooted in the reality of production.  Easier to skim off the top that way.You’ll never guess what sort of a fix a neutral space alien would recommend.

            Ten thumbs up bro!One quibble tho, “as luck would have it…”  It wasn’t luck, but the God of all those White people who gave us the inheritance of this land just about exactly 400 years ago now.  He only wanted our gratitude and obedience.  Once we failed at that, the second half of Deuteronomy 28 became inevitable.All of the consequences you listed—though entirely real—could have been avoided if heritage Americans had carried out their end of the contract…spelled out, once again, in Deut 28.  And contrary to popular belief, this covenant was not given to “JEWS” but to the children of Israel, the seed of Abraham, of whom said heritage Americans indeed are.

            Trust = honesty (or at least some level of it)
That was the idea behind gold backed money – there was a FORCED trust , because the money actually WAS worth something.
What we have now – is not that.
And that is why the Fed exists.
What we have now for “money” is not much different from counterfeit.

                    The problem is that non fiat currencies create bank panics and constant deflation as well as making export goods noncompetitiveWe have surplus production galore  so unless you make the economy 30’s style, 95% domestic you have a problemYou could try a gold/silver standard as Bryant suggested  or hell a D&amp;D standard gold/silver/copper but population growth and efficiency improvements can hurt that as much. The population was 1/5 that of the current era in 1980 mainly do to immigration and that means less moneyIt also renders the USG inflexible which if you are anti government can be a good thing however in time if crisis, you may not have time for the rottenness to be purged from the system and need spending now so people like to 40 million people using SNAP can eatToo much currency rigidity no spendingYou can’t right them off as no matter what policy choices you make, there will still  be a labor surplus. well alright you could pay people not to have kids but I’ll not not even far left societies have done this.As such in time of crisis you can teeter between a soft revolution like Roosevelt or a hard one, choose wisely because play the hard way like the game of thrones, you lose, you die.

        I can come to no conclusion other than the Fed is deliberately raising rates and tightening liquidity to crash the markets in order to ensure that Trump loses in 2020. Inflation rates for 2017 and 2018 are approximately 2 percent, which not materially different than the average inflation rate during the Obama administration and in line with the Fed’s target inflation rate. The economy is strong and while there are signs that wage growth is (finally) picking up, there are no signs of broad-based inflation in assets or in the economy.There is no data-based reason for the Fed to raise rates and pull liquidity at this point in time. The only rational conclusion is that the globalists who run the Fed have decided that a recession is a small price to pay to be rid of Trump. Expect the Fed to start lowering rates and introducing liquidity as soon as a globalist is back in the White House.There will not be a dollar collapse in the lifetime of anybody reading this blog. US finances may be a car wreck, but the rest of the world’s finances are a train wreck or worse. In the next ten years many countries in Central and South America will be forced to adopt the dollar, either explicitly or implicitly by pegging their currency to the dollar. Either way, this will generate massive demand for US dollars. The Middle East and Africa won’t be far behind.

            The fed is raising rates so they will have some space between the federal funds rate and zero to cut from when the recession takes hold

                That doesn’t hold water. There was no sign of a recession until the Fed started raising rates and removing liquidity. The Fed is inducing a recession.
If the Fed needed space between the Fed Funds rate and zero they could have begun raising rates any time in the past 8 years. The only question is why are they doing so now, as opposed to, say, 2014?
The Fed held rates at near-zero and literally flooded the markets with free money during the entire Obama presidency. Trump takes office and they immediately reverse course. Cohencidence?

            Yes, but the real damage being done to the economy is so far limited to people who have exposure to normal interest rates. Historically, our rates are not high at all. The underlying economy is doing well because Trump continues to cut unnecessary federal regulations. But high flyers on Wall Street who have counted on low rates to make their debt binge pay off are the ones who are now squealing. I think it will be good to see these guys get flushed. Serves them right. The rest of us are just fine.

        The current monetary system is fueling the psuedo-affluence that infects our society and creates an artificial absence of real hardship. Here is a partial list of the handouts that government offers to anyone willing to sell their vote for the luxury of being lazy: food, housing, medical care, education, transportation, cell phone/internet, job training &amp; make-work jobs. Is it any wonder that our “poor” are dying of obesity? A reversal via financial crash is preferable to a pandemic, but something’s gotta give.

            Not for anyone. it’s only for ethnics. Whites need not apply.  Those “make work” jobs? Well unless your name is Julio, Shakina or Trayvon you aren’t getting one.
And those sick fatties are a major money maker for big pharma and big medical(at taxpayer expense) so they see those sick fatties as cash cows.
This is just one of many reasons why the system is propped up. Lots of people making money off the moochers from banks, hospitals, big box stores, teachers, etc.

        The credit system is deliberately manipulated to allow the banks to foreclose periodicaly and cherry pick whatever real estate they’d like to own. The big banking famlies already own half the land in the USA and a crooked Federal Reserve system allowed them to buy it with cheap , manipulated money. This country once had money without debt. but the Fed ended that. Close theFederal Reserve and default on funny money backed by credit.

        The real unavoidable crisis involves our demographics and entitlements.  We cannot afford the welfare state we have now.  What happens when the bond markets finally realize that there is no plan to fix it, and cut us off?All the cultural ills that plague us have been papered over to a certain degree with borrowed  money.  What happens when that comes to a head?  What will white liberals do when confronted by real issues that no amount of virtue signaling will fix and tough choices have to be made?  When thinking about how the future is going to shake out with respect to all the issues Z discusses, the imminent collapse of the welfare state is going to have huge effects.At what will our elites do when it hits the fan?  Call for more immigration and green energy, because they are THAT unserious, and that’s the entirety of the script.

        The excellent book “Government’s End” by Jonathan Rauch argues that government necessarily becomes sclerotic and corrupt because of vested interests, and that only a catastrophe can really sweep it clean. A crisis, though very painful in the short-term, could effect the clean-out that we need to make something new in the long run.

        The housing market is a reflection of the times, it’s not a recession per se.
Boomers have expensive houses to sell as they move to their retirement condos, but the new Gig economy guarantees the generations behind them cannot afford boomer homes or even Gen X homes.
More importantly, Millennials don’t want to own houses (or cars for that matter). So it’s not a recession, it’s a major pivot in who has money and how those coming up the ladder want to spend theirs.

        The response to the financial crisis was typical of what passes for leadership today, they are engaged in management, in accounting, not in politics, not in values.The very thing that led up to that crisis is still more or less in play; in many ways things are worse, much worse.  The decay of the financial system is deeply rooted in the decay of the decay of the culture.  The time of throwing money here and there to stem an uprising is coming to an end.  France is simply the first.  Spring will see things accelerate.This is one of the reasons Trump is failing.  He’s about the business contract not the culture.  On some level he understands that but he is what he is.

            At least Trump recognizes the value of a contract.  Most of those opposing him don’t even see that.  They see an open playing field to simply scoop up what they can get their hands on, and then dare anyone to do something about it.

        The thing about the 2008 crisis is that the system held up, but at the same time helped delegitimize itself.  Financial institutions were so sloppy with following the law in regards to mortgages, that no one knew who owned what.  Yet, no one went to jail.  There were no stories of some head honchos now living on the street.  You can take extraordinary measures to save the system, but the people causing the problems have to pay the price.  They can’t be made whole while Joe Blow now has an underwater mortgage which he dutifully pays but gets no help.

        The 2008 crisis is probably the blue print for future crises. The elite causes the crisis then is put in charge of solving it in a manner that further enriches the elite while screwing the average person. The goal isn’t to reform the system. It is to keep the scam running and the money flowing to the right people.
If the next big crisis happens during the Trump presidency, it will be used to try and turn more Americans against populism and white man rule. Thus, it will benefit the elite In another way besides their bank accounts

        All Bernake did was threaten Congress with “tanks in the streets” into giving him trillions to bail out Goldman-Sachs and the other investment banks as well as BofA and other institutions.All these institutions should have been allowed to blow up and die for the crap they pulled on the country blowing a humongous and unsustainable stock and RE bubble that G-S and others could profit from.Yeah there would have been pain but most of the rot and insane speculation would have been cleaned out of the FIRE industry and we could have  started over with a fresh slate. But no Helicopter Ben shows up, throwing trillions to the super rich to make them “whole” again.,  It was nothing but taxpayers subsidizing the super wealthy.Seven trillion to the elite and horrific structural faults of many banks paper over.  Boy how Wall Street loved that easy money with zero interest.  Which they used to blow a new bubble that we live in today.Now for the last decade the Fed and Congress have been kicking the can down the road through a bunch of smoke and mirrors hoping the new bubble doesn’t pop on them.  Perhaps they should consider all the previous bubbles that burst: 2008, 2001, 1990’s.

            Yep.Wages are growth. Wages have declined by around 1% GDP every year since 1973 so your potential spending pool is lower . Wage arbitrage is a bitch.Right now between 38 and 40% of the entire GDP is government spending  and its only going to grow simply because technology , trade and immigration have gutted worker earningsThis will not improve under any normal circumstances and if society stays stable will probably get worseEventually the system will fail but that could be a long long way offThere are stop gap measures, make work like requiring professionals to pump gas, trade control , repatriation of migrants and an end to all cheap labor programs like H1B but even those populist changes will require  a near revolution

                    I’m not doing as well as I’d like but the facts would remain the same if I had an 8 digit income.Do a simple search and at best you’ll get “wage stagnation” I prefer the measure of wages as percentage GDP since it shows how much adjusted wealth we’d have as workers.In terms of family formation this would make one earner families possible which they are basically not now.Here is something from Brookingshttps://www.brookings.edu/research/thirteen-facts-about-wage-growth/TL:DRAfter adjusting for inflation, wages are only 10 percent higher in 2017 than they were in 1973, with annual real wage growth just below 0.2 percent.[1] The U.S. economy has experienced long-term real wage stagnation and a persistent lack of economic progress for many workers.Now adjust for the vast increase in GDP and the distribution  and you tell me how much poorer workers areThose workers are the entire non government consumer base. All of 60% of it (without consumer  demand, corporations can’t spend)The other 40% or so is governmentAnd not there is in modernity is a huge correlation between fertility and increasing prosperity .  Given the fertility slide started in 1972 before Roe V Wade and mirrors a similar slide during the Great Depression before  television , computers birth control or feminism, I’d argue that there is a direct correlation but I can’t prove thatOver its history US “capital” has hated paying good wages and before automation used slavery, indentured service, child labor, prison labor , mass immigration and  every other chicanery to avoid it.This isn’t going to fly if we want a healthy society, we are going to have to pay for it one way or another. More Wages, More State or More Fucked Up pick one.However our actions and complete failures to act suggest that nothing matters more than cheap labor and if capital could just gas and raise as zombies the entire labor pool they’d do it no matter what the long term costThis will BTW put more and more people like Ocasio Cortez in office. She’s a sketchy character but the ones following her ?And in case you are wondering, its not hard to fixRepatriate some tens of millions and if that doesn’t work go work sharing, make work  and if that fails automation taxesThis plus trade management will allow wages to rise and make family formation much more affordableWe’ll still need to fix marriage and child custody  of course but there will be your fertility increaseAnd note “capital” will have to change . Too many on the Right think we  must  have a religious revival that will get people to act against their own economic interest so they can keep acting the way they wantNopeGreater equality or no future.

        Most do not understand the magnitude of the 2008 crash. The USA had been in a economic depression from 2008 to 2016.
The economy is at the level it was in 1973.

        So if I read this correctly , thank god wall street was given trillions to make them whole , while the rest of the economy was put into national debt hock to pay for it.   I see the credit collapse  as analogous to a man with gangrene in his foot.  Dr. Bernanke rushed in and said ” don’t amputate below the knee to stop it , give him these pain killers so he can continue on and all will be well ”   .  now the gangrene  of excessive debt and unfunded mandates is all the way through our leg and getting into the torso.the rebuilding then would have been painful and there would have been losses . Today we have 7 million more illegals ,  the blue collar population is smaller and killing itself off with opiates and suicide by the day. A hollowed out retail sector. as well as gifts that weren’t around in 2008 Antifa and B L Matter anybody? In 2008 Europe had yet to see the flood of several million Muslims refugees . when th going gets rough there because it’s all interconnected they will not be much help.Would anyone say our institutions today are not weaker than they were in 2008?Early diagnosis , early treatment is the health system mantra.  call me black pill but as I have had cancer , and I am glad i had it treated when it was stage 2 rather than having the symptoms treated until it became stage 4.

        People don’t understand that the “value” of most of the things around them is one bid away from being a whole lot less.  In a market economy, everything is marked to market based on that bid or last trade.  Take the bid away, “and it’s gone”.Trust and orderly markets make for constant bids.  We have just about destroyed our trust in institutions of all sorts (many of them thanks to their own actions), and the expectations of an orderly market in the absence of trust is a tall order.  We will get a simulacrum of an orderly market, thanks to the Fed and the Treasury, but that is not the same thing, and cannot be maintained indefinitely.  Expect the devaluation of what is not necessary (which is most of it), and inflation on what people really need.  In the process, the “value” of many things will be knocked way down, and the debt to assets ratio goes completely out of whack.  Like the people near LAX that own a home inflated in value versus their income, the deflation of the asset is the financial coup de gras.Take GE as an example.  Too much debt for the size of the enterprise, but what put it over the edge (and will make the ultimate value of a share of GE precisely zero) is the overvaluation and devaluation of the assets of the company.  In the absence of bids, there is much less value to the assets.

        I’m going to be a contrarian here and say that the US monetary policy has a long way to go before it hits crisis levels.  The US can likely paper over any recession or depression for the next several decades.  The US likely has the ability to demand haircuts as well and would likely get them.  Another reason is that there is not a viable alternative out there.  China is even on more precarious ground than the US.  BRIC/BRICS is a myth that has yet to ever materialize other than fever dreams over at zerohedge.com.I’m not saying things are fine or that we aren’t in a recession because we most definitely are.  I’m just saying this is a protracted decline where it may be 100 years before we get to see Pax Americana fall apart.  American prosperity peaked in the 1990s but we still have cheap energy (although the green energy hoax is seeing to that) and enough distractions and consumer goods to keep people occupied for the foreseeable future.

        The FED is not and never has been a part of the Federal Government. It’s a privately owned, privately run institution. It’s what the Bank of England was to America in 1776.If your profession is to create money and loan it out, then it goes without saying the more you lend—the more you earn. The trillion+ dollar bailout of financial institutions in 2008 was the end goal of the FED’s decade long policy of encouraging banks to loan as much money as possible to anyone who wanted a mortgage. The ’08 crash was intentional, as was every other crash going back to and including the Great Depression.

        I’d have rather had the opposite of the “peaceful” path forward where now (10) years hence we’d have been well on the way to those sins paid in full vs. the insolvent nation we precisely become. The “Fed”? A mistake in its formation as deadly as the war in Iraq and Bush’s “WMD” which caused thousands of lives. More, the economic crisis of 2008-? was in fact caused principally by the Community Reinvestment Act aka “CRA” instituted by the Carter administration. Most miss this fact preferring instead, although he was who he was (and is), “Bush’s Fault”. More than a significant component of the U.S. electorate was and remains as ignorant of facts as they are about the massive conspiracy committed by the Dept. of Just-Us and their armed proxy Famous But Incompetent,CIA/NSA, and clinton0bama… against this lawfully elected President Donald J. Trump. Facts re-packaged by a satanic broadcast and print institutional media. And thanks to the best “thinking” of a dazed, confused, and punch drunk electorate delivered the HoR into the hands of what will prove the most rabid cabal of leftists in American history.

        For me personally I believe a real crisis is around the corner. My hope is that it will purge the political insanity and intellectual bankruptcy that has been weighing us down for decades and come to a near-explosive head right now. I am so sick of the hysteria spewing across the Internet that this is the only solution. We need a common enemy and it’s either economic hardship or we start shooting each other.

        The Fed is already getting ready for the next recession. They’re pushing up interest rates for a variety of reasons, but a big one is that it’ll allow them to lower interest rates when the economy goes in the toilet.The Fed is walking a fine line. Raise interest rates to prepare for the next downturn but don’t raise them so fast that you cause the next downturn but don’t be too slow because you know that a recession is coming. Tough job.However, longer term, interest rates and debt to GDP will be something to watch for. You can run up a lot of debt if you don’t pay much interest. Look at Japan. But if you have debt to GDP of 100% or 150% and fed govt revenues of ~20% of GDP, you can see the havoc that even a one or two percentage point increase in interest rates will cause.Right now, interest rates are around 2.7% on 5-year Treasuries and debt to GDP is 105%. (Yes, I know about the unfunded stuff, let’s just stick with actual debt). So real interest costs are 2.8% of GDP or ~14% of fed gov’t revenues.Now, let’s say that we hit a recession and the govt has to borrow a ton of money – like it did in 08-09 – running debt up to 150% of GDP. Now, let’s assume that the world starts to get a bit nervous about the U.S. and demands higher real interest rates, so a nominal rate of of 5%, which isn’t actually very high at all and could a lot higher. Interest would cost 7.5% of GDP or 37.5% of gov’t revenues. Where is the gov’t going to get that money?Around two thirds of the gov’t spending is already locked up in Social Security, Medicare, govt pensions and Medicaid. Interest on the debt would eat up the rest. If the govt didn’t want to run a deficit, it would almost have to shut down since sending checks out for SS, Medicare and pensions doesn’t take many people.The government would need to borrow to pay for the rest of the government. Naturally, this causes the debt to increase even more, causing even higher borrowing costs. All of these interest costs would come on top of needed increased spending on boomers, which will also increase government spending.The same debt/interest issue holds true for U.S. businesses, which have levered up since 2008.Thankfully, U.S. consumers have reduced their debt to income to near record levels, but governments around the world and corporations have taken on huge amounts of debt.

                Agreed. I’m not fan of the fed in general. People talk about what it does to help in a recession (questionable) but forget that fed moves – usually easy money – is often the cause of the recession.
Markets are far better at fine tuning prices than some committee. The fed is very much like the old Soviet command economy.

            Unless one or both are prepared to run massive deficits, and sell bonds to fund them to the rest of the world, we will all be with the dollar a while longer – though it may not be anyone’s favorite currency.
That’s what the reserve currency is. A place to put your money where you can earn interest while you are holding it.

        Now that I’m started:  the author said: “Never wrote anything to the contrary. That said, we did not have a collapse of the banking system, a great depression and massive civil unrest that would have been the result. From the point of view of the people in charge, that was a good result. Most normal people probably think it was a good result too..     I say you presume too much.  Your assumptions are, in my view, wildly overstated.   Bank depositors were not at risk, if the banks equity and bondholders (who knew or should have known the risk they were taking) had been wiped out, there was plenty of capital left to cover the depositors.  All the Fed need do guarantee the banks stay open, bring in new management.   Ohh, that is kind of what happened with GM.  Why did the banks and their management get a pass?

        “Bernake was given the room to do what had to be done to stabilize the financial system.”actually, he did what was necessary to lock in money center bank profits, and socialize the losses. instead of bail-ins, we got money velocity out of the fed’s fire hose. small holders of bad debt (you and me scale) got wiped out, and most of the banks got a bye.the net effect was to kick the real problem, mis-priced credit and “too big to fail” institutions, down the road. von mises advises that this also makes the necessary reckoning more severe. kicking the can earlier meant bailing out institutional debt holders and then rolling systemic debt up a level. we all scratched our heads in 2008, thinking “where can this possibly go?” the answer is it got rolled up to the level of sovereign debt. where can it go from here?all the marked to model debt still being rolled over, which is technically impossible to repay, will make the coming train wreck inevitable.the model of rolling it up suggests supranational debt, or an international monetary system, maybe debt issued in SDRs or the like. implicit in that is an acknowledgement that the US dollar is done as the reserve currency, which is where things get interesting.the only question should that come to pass is whether it happens overnight or gradually.

        The events of 2008 led to the leaders of the financial system to pump as much liquidity into the market as was needed to stabilize it.  In the process they created our current zombie economy.    An economy that can’t even sustain a minor interest rate hike and a balance sheet reduction of less than 1%.
Institutions will use 2008 as a playbook to do exactly the same thing.  Only they will be dumping three, four, even five times the credit into the system.  This is what will cause the real crisis, something far beyond control.

                Most of this stuff is governed by algos.  Algorithmic models tend to line up on the same side of a trade (as the inputs tend to be similar across many of the algo models), and they need counterparties to provide liquidity.  The potential for the absence of a buyer, in the presence of sellers, is a completely underrated element of the financial equation. Algorithmic models can break, too, in the absence of liquidity.

                Consider this: Right now the corporation you’re lending money to is just going to “invest” it in buying back their own stock.  Is that really a good use of your money?  If you decide “hey this is dumb I should stop doing this” it’s not really a reflection of your assessment of the corporation’s credit-worthiness.Again, can’t be sure, but after a decade of the Paul family and zero hedge predicting the coming crisis I’m a little jaded.  That and there is a help wanted sign up on practically every restaurant door in my city (Houston may be an outlier, but these signs weren’t there before Trump).

        “…In 2008, the world was lucky to have a Fed chairman, who had prepared his whole life for such an event, and a very weak political class…”I don’t believe this. First we must understand the FED and our money supply. All money we have in the US is created by debt. This means it is IMPOSSIBLE to pay off the debt because all money is created by debt so to have more money you go deeper into debt.On a factual actuarial basis since all money is created by the FED and it’s all debt they own everything.I believe the banking crisis was planned. It was planned to give the banks even more control over everything. When it happened “somehow” “…550 billion dollars was being drawn out of money market accounts in the matter of an hour or two…”.  I don’t think this was an accident. This exact same thing was done to several other countries. Notably Argentina and the Asian countries to crash their currencies and loot their banks.See this video from CSPAN. A Representative in the house explained the crash, what prompted it and what they did. It’s not long and explains EXACTLY what precipitated the crisis.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD8viQ_DhS4Listen carefully at 2:25. This is I believe a concentrated attack. It was designed to frighten the Congress to give unlimited purchasing power to the banks. It worked. It is exactly the same thing that George Sores did to the bank of England. The BOE short by Sores is what made his fortune. The USA bank short, by pulling billions from money market accounts, is I’ll bet, the foundation for a lot of other fortunes. The whole derivatives market did not crash but key portions of it did related to the housing market. Specifically the insurance on bundled housing loans. The loans were put together fraudulently and the assets values backing these loans were portrayed fraudulently.Once they had unlimited authority they immediately started looting the treasury. Rep. Ron Paul got a limited audit from the FED many years ago and they said we funded the banks to more than 16 trillion dollars. If it was only about housing with 16 trillion dollars we could have bought EVERY family of four in this country a house of a value of over 250,000 dollars for the same interest we gave to the banks which was essentially ZERO. That would have solved in one swoop the housing crisis. Unfortunately they gave the banks all the money for the houses in the whole US plus the damn houses also.I’ll bet you anything what they did with this money was buy all the assets of all productive businesses in the Western world. I’ll bet they own the majority of stocks in all productive business in the US and most of the farm land also. They can always out bid anyone as they have free money at zero interest to do so. If they buy a business and it makes ANY money at all they can pay the note at zero percent interest. The rest of us have to scrape and they lord over us like Kings.We were played. Bernanke was in charge of the looting of the US.If the banks needed to be bailed out why didn’t the Treasury demand stock in those it bailed out? Shouldn’t we own them and not them own us? At the vary least we should have had equity equal to the bad assets they dumped on us.

        Lets see:  Bernanke’s club members took hundreds of millions off the table, when they craped out, were bailed out of their liquidity jam and left in place to do it all again.  10 years later the banking sectors debt has been transferred to the National debt.  And, so here we are at full employment with a growing deficit and the house of debt we call American can’t withstand a 4% 10 year treasury bill rate.  Debt is not a foundation to build on.

        The way we avoided the crisis of 2009 was not an example of strength but weakness. They broke multiple laws in the way they addressed the crisis. They violated established debt settlement in the way they handled the GM collapse. What we saw was not the system at work. It was a violation of the system in an attempt to save the system. 2009 is still happening they’ve just delayed it.

        A system based on debt…. especially ever expanding debt  CANNOT last.  What cannot last will not last.  It MUST end….and historically that end is almost always violent.  We dodged a bullet in 2008-2009.  Another bullet is headed our way. Whether we dodge this one or not cannot be predicted…..but the bullets will keep coming and sooner or later….. probably sooner……a bullet will hit dead center and the economy collapses.

        I’m a simple man , no problem admitting it, but losing $40,000 back in 08 to Big Banks was not my idea of saving the country.The bastards created the crisis and then picked my pocket to bail their asses out. Don’t need any fancy current market analysis to know the hours  are longer and the pay is less.Left the government sector thanks to insane liberal policies and quotas. Had no idea why my friends used to bitch constantly working in the private sector.The FED saved us,  indeed !  Happy to make the sacrifice so some fat cat can buy his kid a new Ferrari for Christmas.

        I don’t believe we are any closer to some terrible financial meltdown now or ten years from now.Play the game and IF the bottom drops out pile all your mortgaged stuff in front of your mortgaged dwelling. Drop back 25 yards to prepared positions, stack magazines and fight. Don’t let some bankster and constable mess with you. That’s the only answer. You ain’t no Tom Joad cause there won’t be any place to go.

        Fortunately, when the already-underway currency crisis can no longer be ignored even by school girls at the mall., the US dollar will still be the only reliable currency in the world. Eventually, it, too, will go under, but it will be the last currency to do so. But that process *is* already underway.

        The so called “long depression” was a period of unprecedented economic growth and rising living standards.  Yes a few improvident borrowers and speculators were hurt during it, but it was overwhelmingly positive for the overwhelming majority of people in the country.  We should be so lucky as to live through a similar period.

        It’s a buying opportunity. I’m expecting the S&amp;P 500 to be trading in the 3000-3100 range next year.

Every communist get,s sooner or later his very own year 1938. About isms, I am the supporter of fishism. There is always a bigger fish….:D
