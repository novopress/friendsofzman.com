        “Of course, what makes health insurance an impossibility is we will all get sick and die eventually.”I’d disagree with that. The real problem with health insurance is the inability to define what “health” really means in an actuarial sense.Life insurance works because death is an objective condition. Norwegian blue parrots aside, that is. And it is generally easy to diagnose and understand the proximate causes of death. So, life insurance risk can be understood and managed using actuarial science.Health is different. There are two types of health dysfunction: injury, and illness. Injury is similar to death, in that it can be easily and objectively diagnosed (frequently without any medical expertise whatsoever), and the proximate causes are easy to identify and understand. Furthermore, the costs associated with treating injuries are pretty easily defined. Consequently, you can apply actuarial science to injury, and you can insure against it. People instinctively know this; you buy a catastrophic health insurance plan in order to insure against “getting hit by a bus”, and in that sense, you can get real value for what you pay for.Illness, on the other hand, presents tremendous problems. Diagnosis of illness is anything but easy. Any idiot can diagnose a compound fracture of the leg; diagnosing many (if not most) illnesses is an expensive and unpredictable process. What’s worse is that even when an illness is properly diagnosed, many illnesses have many different treatments that must be subjectively determined and evaluated– and all of these different treatments have different cost profiles. And, we have an incredibly poor understanding of what the proximate causes of many illnesses actually are; complicating matters even further, some illnesses are brought on by undiagnosed underlying conditions that are all but impossible to predict or even define.The result of all this uncertainty means that applying actuarial science to illness is hopeless. If you can’t define the risk, much less manage it, running an insurance business against that risk is folly.

        The most pernicious aspect of politicians’ substitution of “insurance” for what we used to call government is their unrelenting pursuit of ever larger pools of consumers to foot the mislaid premiums.The urge to expand “the pool” surges in direct proportion to the insurers’ inability to book returns on the premiums.  Thus, when Social Security becomes insolvent, they increase the pool.  When Medicare/Medicaid show a loss, they increase the pool.  And, one day, when the government chokes on its red-ink, as it is doing right now, the political class can only “increase the pool.”What that means, essentially, is they’ll need to spread the risk to people living outside the government’s jurisdiction, like, to people in far flung places like Mali, Indonesia or Morroco to tidy up their ledgers.Could it be then, that our elite’s yen for transnationalism and one world government  indicates that they have so badly invested the premiums (ie. taxes) that we citizens have entrusted to them that the only option available to them that will (1) stave off the system’s collapse one more generation AND (2) thwart their being held to account for their mal-investment is the corrupt United Nations and a global taxing authority?I think that’s the nub of it.  Carbon taxes anyone?Telling, isn’t it?

            And yes,  let us tear down those borders everywhere and let the horde find it’s own equilibrium and there is your easily controlled pool expansion.  Nicely done.

        Insurance premium investment?Gosh, what happens to all the (mandatory) recurring premiums that NEVER pay out, according to approved actuarial table claims?Sure seems fuzzy between banking laws, Insurance laws, and investment laws.Why are THOSE law books so thick?

        To your broader point, I think it’s worse than you think. Much of the population simply doesn’t understand the principle of insurance. At. All.

        The liability would presumably be for negligent carrying or storage that permitted someone to obtain your gun. The interesting part about that insurance demand would be cases like a concealed carrier getting into a struggle with an attacker where the attacker was able to take the gun.  You’d then be legally liable for a potential string of crimes all because you lost a street fight?

        You’re in error when you say insurance has no role when you shoot somebody. The legal fees you will incur in a perfectly justifiable shooting with no criminal charge nor civil suit filed can easily hit five figures.
There are insurance companies today that sell policies that cover your negligence, your legal fees defending a civil suit, and your legal fees defending criminal charges if you are acquitted.
You’re correct of course about the real agenda behind creating this requirement.

        I like the idea of any “illegal” or immigrant looking to fast track it, to pay insurance. Question is, who is holding the $$ and who will be paying out when inevitably, things go awry. More tort!
