        One day in the early 70’s, I was hard at work at my very specialized job, when I flashed back to the one semester computer course I was required to take in business school. I realized everything I was doing could be done by a computer.  Now, only a few decades later, that job has indeed been automated, and I’m retired.

        I think that you will simply see more middle class people added to the government rolls as they get automated out of their jobs.  The last thing the state wants is millions of unemployed, middle class blokes sitting around coffee shops sharing their grievances and plotting sedition. Orwell and Burnham once again raise their ugly heads.If I was twenty years younger, I’d buy a farm, spend five years learning how to be productive enough to feed my family, and make myself as useful as possible to the local gentry. If I was ten years older, I’d be counseling my kids to do the same. In terms of catastrophic failure, I do not believe that things have been this bad since 1962.Re the inter office mail throw away. I had a boss who did the same thing. He was enormously successful and retired near the top of his field.

        You’re correct, of course, though I’d add that great hilarity and frustration can result when the guys in charge of hiring and firing are unable to tell the difference between busy work and essential work. The low level employees usually know the difference, but the folks upstairs can be hilariously clueless.
I’ve observed this all my working life, though things were particularly sad/funny back during the worst years of the Great Recession, when everyone was tightening their belts and companies were suddenly discovering they had entire departments right under their noses that were completely useless and had been for years.

        Sums up a lot of what I see in healthcare and hospitals.  If “truly necessary” was the standard of care, we could send two thirds of our employees home immediately, and boot half our patients.  On the other hand, most of this country doesn’t know the difference between health insurance and health care, so who knows.

        “STEM fields are notoriously un-PC because they are right answer fields. Checking the right boxes does not trump getting the wrong answer.”Not in the government and in government contract work. True story: I once saw an experienced NASA engineer ask why the Delta IV, with a single engine first stage, needed a separate roll thruster.

                In general, you need a force offset from and tangential to the centerline of the vehicle to generate a roll moment.

        When I worked (oh, the joys of retirement) I had to do regular reports that I knew full well no-one would read. I would list this and that and compare the newest numbers with previous lists — the system we had was things had to be a percentage above or a percentage below, you just couldn’t have bare numbers — and be prepared to answer questions on it. But, no questions were ever needed as no one really cared. Reports were duly submitted, filed away and eventually discarded unread.When I went into education briefly, all students’ work (as they didn’t actually study and just copied and pasted from wikipedia, that was a misnomer) had to be stored away for five years. No one ever wanted it, never cared about it and then it had to thrown away. But storing it was an art!Of course the best busy work is a meeting as you get to sit down, drink coffee, laugh at the boss’ pathetic jokes and then go away without anything being done. But us report writers… now that was hell.

            I knew a guy back in the days of inter-office mail who had a great system. Every day the mail room would drop off his stack of mail and he would place it on the credenza, moving the previous day’s mail down a spot. He had seven stacks on the credenza and when he got his eighth day of mail, he would push the oldest pile off into the waste basket. He never bothered opening any of it unless some one called. When someone called about something sent to him, he would ask when they sent it and then fish it out from the corresponding pile.His theory was that most of it was crap and no one waited more than seven business days to follow up on something of any importance.

                Z man,
Read a biography of Napolion and you will find he used that technique to filter his work. He ignored mundane memos day by day and only handled ones that were a repeat of ones sent earlier which demonstrated their importance. These were administrative memos not war fighting ones.

        Wow! This one doesn’t hit too close to home! I, of course am not one of the busy workers. Too busy. I know a professor of science (real science, although this person also believes in SCIENCE!) who is doing research in the arctic; when I asked what the outcome of the research was the reply was ” we got 40 papers out of the project.”  In other words, busy work.

        Very funny.  I had to laugh out loud.  Busy work is the definition of ‘government work’ as we have orders of magnitude more government at every level than needed.  Almost every government worker is redundant and expendable.

        “Maybe the alternative is a world composed of busy work. The robots will figure out that humans need to feel important and that means performing work. The robots will create a world where it appears all of us are doing important stuff, but in reality we are just spinning our wheels, killing time in busy work, like maintaining blogs.”
This is the plot of the Matrix movie, the machines first created a virtual reality paradise for humans but they rejected this and died, so the machines created the busy work world of the Keanu Reeves character.
