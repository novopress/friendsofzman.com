        In my day we called it pretentious. I guess the PC police have outlawed that term by now.

        Yes, “…its stunning whiteness.”  But yet they will bloviate on diversity, vibrancy, cis-genderism, paternalism, etc. They will settle in nice, safe gated communities  as soon as they matriculate in the work world and send their kids (or one perfect child – Alexander) to Montessori or Friends school to keep their spawn from mixing. Excuse me for now, I must get back to my latte while on my Apple computer with my blue tooth phone to my ear. Are my signals getting through?

        re: Whole FoodsFunny you should mention it. None where I live. But, currently am visiting my son and a Whole Foods saved the day. My wife and son put on a dinner for a couple last weekend; the wife is a good friend of my wife and the husband is a good friend of mine from my years in California. Our son grilled the main meal and my job was to find Medjool dates for an appetizer. I called the usual supermarkets starting with Safway and struck out. Whole Foods had them. I drove about four miles and picked up the dates and wandered the store. It was filled with all the New Age food one could want but it had beautiful fresh sea food and simply Gorgeous Meat.I can see why Whole Foods is successful. BTW, the dates were stuffed with goat cheese.Dan Kurt

        I got my iPhone 5c from Verizon for free, sold my old one for $38.00. As to diversity, I find uniformity of thought to be unsettling but not uniformity of physical appearance. I’m more comfortable with my tribe than the other guy’s. I agree there’s a lot of signaling going on, but I think it’s a good thing. Nobody really wants to be like everybody else. Even in the ghetto, where I lived for the first eighteen years of my life, people are signaling all day long. We all signal within our tribe.

        Lived in China. Don’t ingest anything from China. Not unless you like cancer. God love Whole Foods for trying.
