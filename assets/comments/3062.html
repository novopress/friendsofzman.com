        It seems to me that the reason this particular political hack was choosen is his ability to pull off a cover-up. I think what is in play here is that Obama is bringing in as many “immigrants” as he can and doesn’t want the ebola crisis to either interfere with this or to spotlight it. Prior to this event did you or anyone else know that 150 people a day come to the U.S. from Liberia? There seems to be a concerted effort by Obama’s administration to push as many people over the border as possible before he is out of office in 2016. This plan was originally hatched by Democrats in the 60’s as a path to total dominance of politics in the U.S. The plan was to push legal and illegal immigration while at the same time giving these new potential voters “free stuff” and buying them as Democrat voters forever. That was working and did work quite well. But today the plan is expanding, many in power actually really dislike America and in particular Americans of European descent. Now the plan is to not just take over politics for the Democrat party but for a coalition of anti-white voters who will bring their bizarro version of “equality to this country. That will mean limits and prohibitions on white’s in positions of power and laws and court decisions that mandate “reparations” and higher taxes and other punative actions to “get even” and of course to continue the never endng flow of “free stuff”. Think about the recent massive immigrations that have taken place over the last 5 years. Muslims, West Africans, Haitians, Mexicans, South Americans, Chinese, and others. Literally millions and millions of immigrants legal and illegal. One estimate puts this number at 30 million in Obama’s five years. With his recent acceleration of the plan it could be another 20 million before he leaves office. Combine this with the Democrat penchant to have non-citizens vote and you have the makings of a disaster.

        Kathleen is right. The test whether a politician is serious about their professed beliefs is whether they would put their own family through whatever they claim is good for everyone else. All too often, the smooth-talking self-servers find swift reasons why their own kids shouldn’t be exposed, or serve, or put themselves in harm’s way.
Remember, if it’s good enough for you to endure then it’s good enough for them to avoid.

        “Since the Judicial Watch claims are completely unsourced and unsubstantiated, and combine a number of Red Tribe cultural bugaboos, and are really implausible..”Why is the claim implausible?  JW didn’t say that hundreds or thousands of Ebola victims would be brought to the US.  Perhaps the plans—if they are real—call for a few or a few dozen patients to be brought to the US, maybe for humanitarian reasons, maybe for research and training purposes  That’s entirely plausible.  The point is that lawless actions by the President are well within the realm of possibility, given his attitude towards illegal immigration.  And of course, how many people know that Obama has just unilaterally cleared the way for up to a hundred thousand Haitians to enter the US, ostensibly as relief from the after effects of the 2010 earthquake in that country?  That’s going to cost us another $5 billion a year in welfare relief for people who have already turned southern Florida into a third world state like the country they left because they had made a shambles of it.

        This administration has proven time and again that they care more about the furtherance of their Marxist agenda and childish Leftist view of the world as they wish it, instead of the world that is, than they do about the American people. It certainly would surprise very few people if this turns out to be true. If President Ebola remains insouciant on the topic, someone should ask him if he’d allow his daughters to pay a visit, perhaps to shake hands even, with an Ebola patient.

        Medical teams from the US that have been sent to West Africa to deal with Ebola have been brought back to the US for treatment.  Its very debatable whether this is a good idea, but its not insane.Bringing West Africans to the US for treatment is insane, in fact its insane to the point of being physically impossible.  There are alot of infected West Africans, and not enough treatment facilities in the US, though they do exist in West Africa and have been handling matters better than the US facilities with their limited number of patients.  Just organizing a sort of airlift may be impossible.  Even if you were Dr. Evil and deliberately wanted to spread the virus in the US, there are much better ways to do that.Since the Judicial Watch claims are completely unsourced and unsubstantiated, and combine a number of Red Tribe cultural bugaboos, and are really implausible, I’m pretty sure this is a case of JW unscrupulously waving a number of red flags to get eyeballs.  You weaken your own credibility by paying any attention to it.
