        I know I’ve commented this before, but it bears repeating. What we are watching is not hypocrisy, defined as “The practice of professing beliefs, feelings, or virtues that one does not hold or possess; falseness.”What we have today are two completely separate sets of rule books. Lacking a better construct, I call them the Team Blue Rulebook and the Team Red Rulebook. John Roberts can send messages to Trump that “for over 200 years” the appellate process is how we settle disputes last month. Yet on Friday SCOTUS issued an emergency stay on a case that had not been decided by the appellate court, and did not all the Trump DOJ even an opportunity to respond.That is how the two rule books work. To advance Team Blue objectives, you can cite the criticality of precedent, and then abandon precedent when precedent is no longer convenient. That is classic Team Blue Rulebook action.Team Red Rulebook is that you get to have your communities flooded with terrorist criminal aliens by the millions. They’re allowed in, unvetted, by the millions in waves. To throw them out? You must give each one full due process and go “one at a time”. And of course the Team Red Rulebook contains all manner of made up crimes for which you can be prosecuted, most of which never existed until the need to put you in prison arose.Anyway, it’s not hypocrisy. It’s two completely different sets of rules. The SCOTUS “stay” on Friday was likely the final decloaking of lizard people we long suspected of having forked tongues.They’ve run out of ways to conceal the existence of the two books.

            The perfidy of the Trump 45 justices – Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett – their perfidy is simply breathtaking.
Who the hell are these zombies?

                I’m starting to think the three + Roberts are solid evidence of a deep strike operation against the Supreme Court &amp; Constitution — the people, or whatever one wants to call it.”Grow in office?”  Maybe not.At the one extreme, one could say that they were chosen for a certain ideological “set”, and husbanded through a career. This pool of potentials would contain those who, while espousing one perspective, would be standing by to put into effect it’s opposite.at the proper moment, they could be tapped to assume the final role for which they were groomed.Paranoia?Or, conversely they might just be the usual ideological and political opportunists we find in the Republican ranks — whatever stance is needed to get elected or selected. But you never then support whatever it is the traditional Americans (or Republicans … but I choke on that word) want.it just seems too much for coincidence.

                    It’s a lot easier to see a conspiracy of some kind than it is to see what principles or laws they might honestly be trying to uphold. Making the latter case seems a lot more difficult. I couldn’t say whether or not they are being coerced, or they honestly just hate heritage americans and want to see them replaced, or they are vested in clown world somehow, but all of those things appear a lot more probable than them making an honest interpretation of the law.

                        We all know how nasty leftists are in ordinary interactions, where the stakes are very small.Think of how they are OK with using violence and intimidation when they don’t get their way.As we have seen with the DOGE revelations, there is good money to be had  being a leftist – this is highly motivating to useless people, who will get very nasty at the idea of having to do honest work.Now think about how they would interact with someone who has actual power. They have a way of ganging up, of infiltrating and subverting every normal societal function. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the leftists “terrorize ” to get their way.

                Somebody at VDare was ecstatic about Gorsuch because he had an English surname. This should have been a warning “forGod is no respecter of persons but in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by him.”

                    Somebody needs to learn that nowadays, an English name just means your ancestors were some kind of wretched Anglicans who were probably gung-ho for the Yankee side in the War of Northern Aggression. Give me a mobbed-up Italian or solid Nazi Austrian any day over that.

                I knew Amy Comey Barrett was going to be dreadful when I found out she had Haitian pet ethnics that she “raised” as her adopted children.The problem is the partisan vs. objectivist. The conservatives see the Supreme Court as a real court of law that interprets the law and settles disputes.The Left sees the court as a supralegislature with lifetime terms.The GOP says they appoint “constitutional conservative” justices who interpret the law.The Democrats just appoint left-wing cranks who always rule the way the progressive psychopaths want. I call them “Blue Team” judges. You ALWAYS know which way they’ll vote in any decision. It’s so predictable and it’s a shock when they’re allowed by the Blob to break ranks.If there is another vacancy, Trump needs to appoint a “Red Team” judge who doesn’t consider the facts, but simply votes the right way. The constitution is not worth the paper it’s written upon.We need to deport these people. Trump should (but won’t) pull an Andrew Jackson and say to the Supreme Court “I hear you, but enforce your order if you will.”

                They probably just know the “six ways from Sunday” isn’t hyperbole and they don’t have the fortitude, the dumb luck, and/or the favor that Trump has. But who does?! It really is amazing.

            Those two sets of rules look like two chapters of a single rulebook. Team Blue Rule Chapter is a favorite part of the go fast team. Team Red Rule Chapter is the favorite part of the go slow team. They’re running out of ways to fool us into believing that they are reading from different Bibles. It’s all in one Bible.

                This needs to be understood. People might be looking at this deportation thing and be furious the GOP does not have Trump’s back. Trump is arguing the facts here, that it’s basically impossible to get rid of these people even though it’s so easy to let them in. Well, that is because the GOP wanted the 8+ million illegals in this country as much as the Democrats did. They don’t want these people gone. Their “bipartisan border bill” was designed to permanently keep the border open for millions of illegals a year. If anything it took power away from the President to close it.What we have in this country is a foreign ruling elite that hates us and wants us dead. Even if they are notliterallyforeign as they increasingly are, they are loyal to foreign nations (or should I say, a foreign nation), or consider themselves to be “global citizens” part of some cosmopolitan transnational identity. But this is what happens when foreigners rule over a people they despise. And it’s all of them.

                    Everyone needs to admit that the USA is a great mistake, maybe eventheGreat Mistake, one worse than Luther’s rebellion against his priesthood of thirsty cryptosecularists. (Faith in a god is no evidence that one rejects secularism.) The experiment, as some like to call it, is an abomination, and thisbecauseof its hideous, intrinsic, foundational defects.So today’s today’s situation and the Columbians’ one party system is not an aberration contrary to the founding principles but a milestone on the way to the annihilation entailed by the founders’ crazy merchants’ morality. So, like the Phonecians among us, American conservatards are mortal enemies of all that is good, beautiful, and true. They help tobl stabililize what the D faction would quickly wreck, thereby ridding us of a great cancer. Yet the Z man remains mentally corrupted with their conservatard fantasies and agitprop. This is why he can write with a straight face that the GAE began after Lincoln. It did not. It began politically during the 1770’s and as an ideal before that.

            Agree totally. What precious little legitimacy the Supreme Court retained was set on fire. It joined basically every American institution on the ash heap of lost respectability. Where are the preachers to give us eulogies? That’s right, pretending the dead are alive, no resurrection necessary. Arguing About fairness and hypocrisy with the delusional is pointless.

            Team Blue rides the bus of “democracy,” the “rule of law” and “free speech” until it isn’t convenient. Then it’s time for them to squelch dissent, the reasoning being that we can’t even tolerate a shred of evil, lest it cast people into sin.I used to think the opposition was just stupid, but I came to realize that they were nothing of the sort and just playing their part as the “principled opposition” in the great Kabuki theater of politics in the U.S.Boil it down even further and it’s the old saw of “heads, we win, tails we win.”Goldberg and French are just awful human beings. I pity those poor wretches who operate without a moral underpinning that they’ll have to answer for in the next life. I just wish they weren’t supported by evil, megawealthy patrons who want their errors spread.

                Yes, every pundit has been opining on how strongman Trump is going to destroy our system of government and “democracy”…whatever that might be with millions of fake mail-in ballots…The reality seems to be that he’s quite the opposite, weak and unwilling to take on our fake legal system, and nominations like Amy are a big part of the problem…Presidents Jackson, Lincoln, and even Clinton ignored SCOTUS decisions when inconvenient, and Washington would likely have had judges like Boasburg shot, which is why we didn’t have such judges…

                Or, he is, but the system has become “self aware” and knows how to combat reform.  Notice how DOGE seems to have peaked in March, and the government is talking about “when” not “if” the hiring freeze gets lifted.

            In fairness, it’s been “Who/Whom” from the beginning. The great Yankee Moralizer John Adams set the tone. He defended the British in the Boston Massacre (“muh due process”, admittedly pre-Revolution but it shows his mindset) and then passed the Alien and Sedition Acts (“I decide who stays or goes”). Here we are many years later retracing the same well-worn trail of the Founders.

            It’s simpler than that. It’s partisan politics, and the left is much better at it than the right. They will do whatever moves their side forward. If the truth helps them, they tell the truth. If lies help them, they lie. It’s the old quote about lawyers, “If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against you, argue the facts. If the law and the facts are against you, pound the table and yell like hell.”Team blue understands this. They don’t care about the errant calls of the other side calling them hypocrites. It’s about the cause. The republicans are terrified of doing things procedurally wrong or being called a hypocrite, so they rarely adhere to this, which is a big reason why our trophy case is so empty.

                Yep. ‘cept the truth never helps Team Blue. It’s why Team Blue goes with whatever falsehood most closely aligns. They prefer to appeal to the Marshall Court, since that was the rubber stamp that was applied to any federal excesses, but they often have to appeal to Globalism, as not even Marshall was that pro-tyranny.

And it gets truly horrifying if its sentience has a distinctively feminine quality to it…

Decades later, same girl was out fertilizing the lawn while I was away on business. We dig fence post holes together.It does not get better. Much older now, her face is a smile, laughter every day.Am I supposed to think she is even the same species as ‘Instragram/Onlyfanz’ woman?Did I err teaching my daughters how to change their own oil? Of course not …. but the gulf between them and ‘peers’ is enormous.

            The law is whatever they say the law is.  Shockingly, they almost always find the law supports whatever it is they want to do.
The problem is that there has been no accountability for anyone in the managerial class for a very long time.  Official accountability is entirely off the table….we need an unofficial accountability or they will keep doing it.  Few people will stop doing what they want to do by appealing to their alleged principles.  They need to face consequences like prison or being ruined financially.

                Tars Tarkas:“we need an unofficial accountability or they will keep doing it“Classically, about once every century, the Peasants would stage a revolt, replete with scythes &amp; axes &amp; pitchforks &amp; torches, and the Landed Gentry would flee in terror.Our fundamental sociological problemat the momentis that the peasants are far too satisfied.Their bellies are too full.Their houses are too warm in the winter.Their infant mortality rates are too low.And the SSRIs certainly aren’t helping matters.It’s very difficult to stage a proper rebellion if you’re narked up on SSRIs.Which, come to think of it, is probably why “they” invented SSRIs in the first place: Precisely so as to quell the peasant revolts.

                    Popular refrain, but not a lot of empirical evidence to support it. If anything, the opposite. It’s when people are suffering that the demogogues strike, not only by stressing that the current population are the only ones in history who could have pulled through such hard times, but pointing out a convenient scapegoat for their troubles.
Sorry, but history itself is a pretty strong indicator that the demogogues cause the suffering, and use it to create a more unified populace, one supporting the current Dear Leader.

                        Still, they are not going to change because we ask them to change or vote for them to change or appeal to their supposed principles or an appeal to a dusty old piece of paper safely locked away in a museum.  The only way they will change is if that change is forced upon them.  Ordinarily, this used be done by either social pressure or enforcing the laws and norms or some other formal mechanism.  These no longer work.Furthermore, they are aping the old process and using it as a rationalization for them doing what they want to do.  Like some fool in a dress holds what appears to be “court” in a room with everyone playing dress up and doing things people do in a court room.  But unlike long ago (probably not even entirely real then), the outcome is a foregone conclusion before the play being put on even starts.

            Yes.  In the meantime The Chinese Communist Party, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and the UN are still preparing to destroy America by invasion.   The camps in Panama are still there though the volume of invaders is currently way down.   This happened for a time during COVID as well.   HIAS is still manning their offices in the area.  Mayorkas himself actually visited these camps.Note that the CCP and HIAS work together for similar interests.   If the Trump administration was serious about stopping the invasion he would destroy these camps.  He would also require employers to use the real ID system for perspective employees.   He could also start prosecuting people who facilitated the invasion by using 8 USC 1324 and it’s subsections. UN employees, DHS employees and many others could be held to account.  Mayorkas, for instance, could easily be given a life sentence.Every employer and even people who rent houses to illegals could be prosecuted for this offense.   So we are all being played and the administrations’ enforcement activities are just a superficial charade.

                Good points in general. But the CCP is almost exclusively an instrument of internal control and repression. Unlike the HIAS with its tribal fear of Europeans, the CCP looks inwardly for its preservation (something Zionism laid claim to but has never quite achieved). To China, America is just a source of technology and consumers for manufactured goods. They would likely prefer to maintain the status quo of a hollowed-out U.S. empire pretending to run the rest of the world were it not for the determination of the anti-China hawks in successive U.S. administrations to challenge them directly.

                    Nevertheless, numerous Chinese nationals, most of which are military age males, have been delivered to and have used the same staging camps that are administered by HIAS and the UN.   After departure from the camps the invaders, Chinese among them, are delivered to the U.S. Border and then taken to America.
We always look at the U.S., Mexico Border,  however in the last few years the Canadian Border is producing larger and larger numbers of illegal entries as well.  That Border will become a huge problem in a short few years.

                        The CCP isn’t behind this. The Chinese nationals in question are as likely as not to becomeanti-CCP (oranti-White) with the encouragement of the usual suspects. DRs need to be able to distinguish between such golem and our actual sworn enemies. The CCPisn’tour friend, but that doesn’t mean we should be anti-China—which could be suicidal—just because our enemies say “Sick!”

                        Already a problem and has been for at least a decade, just not reported on.  As Trudeau opened Canada’s borders, he also began a cascade of subcon aliens coming south to AINO in search of more money to fleece from foolish Whites. Over 150k from dozens of countries apprehended since 2021 alone.

                Don’t let organizations like Red Cross, World Council of Churches, Lutheran Social Services and Catholic Charities USA skate.
It’s way too commonplace to finger some convenient Big Bad Evil Guy (BBEG), and completely ignore the fact that we are surrounded by BBEGs .They are in front of us, behind us, and we are flanked on both sides by an enemy that outnumbers us 29:1.

                    Yes. If Trump was serious about addressing the problem he would start prosecuting these organizations. The main point is, like most things Trump, it is all just a talking point and misdirection. Their will be no prosecutions or mass deportations and Trump knew that all along.
The Supreme Court just officially sealed our fate and without mass deportations this country is done. You could completely seal the Borders and it is still too late. The invaders will out breed us easily. So it will come down to the cartridge box or oblivion.  I would bet against the cartridge box.

Not my downvote, but what would you suggest they be prosecuted for? Accepting a legitimate government contract and fulfilling it?
We can certainly hate them for being the immoral or amoral bastards at the sharp end of the spear, which they are, but so long as Congress and the Deep State keep letting those contracts, at best you have a game of musical chairs with new players joining all the time to get some of that sweet, sweet graft.

        My, how inconvenient for the faithful.  We’ve got to vote harder because . . . trust in the process because . . . the system will work because . . . The Court.  Just pick the correct magic lawyers and voila!  We are saved!  How many years have I heard that refrain?  How many even here waxed rhapsodic about this or that court pick?  We had a bunch of preachers here the other day warning us that if we didn’t toe the line, the left would do unto us when it was their turn again.  Seems I saw JamieRaskin warning just what sort of payback he had in mind.  So come, great preachers!  We all await your wisdom.

            Brett’s a chick-name, no?  :O)Brett-of-the-daughters. Brett the girls’ soccer coach, Brett with the gaggle of female law clerks ever around him.  Not sure what exactly folks expected from this overgrown boy.Ah yes Brett.  He wept bitterly when the Mean Girls in Congress ganged up on him, and showed the nation — and world — how easy it is for some random skank somewhere to take down a man.  Jam him up.  Get him fired.  Jailed.  Even an appeals court justice is not off-limits.When expressing my disgust with this human cheese puff on ‘conservative’ sites, I was met with an avalanche of rage and offense.  They rushed to little Brett’s defense and assured me he would kick majorly ass on the Left once his nomination passed.  Eeets . . . a head-shaker.  Lord come and get me.Problem is, most righty men are like Brett.  This is what masculinity in the West has become, and nowhere is it more apparent than in Amerika.

                    Sadly, since the demise of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves, this is true. Those interpretations were soundly defeated. I don’t know what it would take to unseat this doctrine, but from that moment (1798, and arguably before) GAE was set in stone.

            Here is what chatgpt did to zman’s text –“These two festering lumps of mediocrity are well-known examples, but the public square is crowded with aspirants—people who dream of one day ascending the soapbox to lecture the masses on their moral failings. The Covid Karens of recent memory made one thing clear: behind the smiling facade of any stranger might lurk the sour-mouthed scold, lips puckered from a lifetime of sipping vinegar, just waiting for a moment of weakness to strike. We are all sinners now, dangling in the grip of an angry god named Karen from Human Resources.The preacher has long held a sacred role in human society—but only when confined to his pulpit, where we might seek him out for guidance or inspiration. He serves his purpose best when called upon, a beacon in moments of doubt. But in modern America, the preachers have broken free of their sanctuaries and now roam unchecked through our daily lives, enforcing their gospel with fervor and suspicion. They sniff out sin with zeal, and when they find none, they manufacture crises to justify their sermons. What should be the quiet work of living becomes a theater of moral panic, and no joy is left unpoliced.”

It was an epiphany for me and I never took the GOP seriously after. My buddy asked me what I thought about Jeb! and I said: “he’s Hillary, but with bigger t*ts”.

                    Didn’t use to be, but then became infested, originally by the types that vote like Trotsky but want to live like a KKK member.  And Northwestern,  was still the “normal” school in that tier–went there on the advice of my uncle who’d gotten his BA &amp; PhD there but taught at one of the Ivies which had all gone to sh*t much earlier.  Now it’s no different. Stopped giving them money years ago.

            Thank you, Sir!My Yankee-descended grandmother was a member or that organization, as well as descendant of Republican party founders in Wisconsin.  She was also, God bless her, a suffragette who moved to Mississippi to teach black elementary children  for a number of years and later traveled to Los Angeles to connect with the religious nuts of the era.    She idolized Cary Nation who demolished taverns throughout my home state.  Several times as a child I,  with my siblings,  had to publicly  recite at her church the “Temperance Pledge” to never drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes.  If there had been an Evangelical equivalent of monasteries and convents, I am sure we would have had to also take those vows at age nine to ten.I guess that is the gist of why when the Navy sent me to Italy I went native.   I’m not too fond of the GOP, either.

                I’m sure that stayed with those little black children, those enduring lessons about the ebils of Colt 45 and Cool cigarettes, plus it had the added cachet of coming out of the sainted lips of an old white lady from Wisconsin.

                    Well, it didn’t work on me.    I do wonder how the movement got the name “Temperance” when it really advocated Prohibition. I was definitely primed for the explanation by Zman and others that the modern American left traces its beginnings to the Puritans and other Northern low church religious types.

These are your words.  The ‘bless’ is right there next to ‘suffragette’ and you are quite proud.  Well, offended now that you’ve been called on it.
God does not bless feminists, especially proto-feminists.  No, not even YOUR feminist.

It’s just that while there was widespread agreement that, for example, Genesis was correct when talking about separating the races after the Tower of Babel, there was a whole lot less about current day Israel being given over to Abraham and his decendants.
It’s almost like it’s true if we want it to be true…

                                Truth. I know lots of Catholics who preach we should be gracious towards Francis. We do not have to be in agreement to wish that those who disagree with us might be forgiven.
Indeed, that’s the whole point of forgiveness. It’s nonsensical to pray for those who are right for having been right, particularly when it’s a consequence of your circumstances…

                                    This transcends Christianity and definitely denominations:  Don’t speak harshly about others’ family members. One can tell a story about a family member’s faults in the company of friends, but it’s very rude to come back with an amplification of that.  The “brother” was meant sincerely and as an olive branch because I appreciate this company and you specifically at times whatever our differences.   Enough. Have a joyous Easter week

        I remember people making fun of Jonah Goldberg twenty years ago, for being an idiot chickenhawk coward who got to where he was because of his shyster mother. I mean, this has been going on for a LONG time. But he has served his masters well and has been rewarded with earthly riches for it. He’s never had to be right and never been accountable for anything he has said in his career. Yet, these people don’t control the narrative anymore… and they know it. Look at how Douglas Murray got laughed off the Joe Rogan show and then he immediately retreated to Sam Harris’ show and the New York Post where he can snipe at people from a safe distance. The neocons have constructed their own parallel media network where they are free from scrutiny and criticism, almost like BlueSky is for the pinkhairs and xirs.

                Like Z once said on a podcast, more or less, these guys are making $500,000 a year when they aren’t qualified to sell cars in their hometown. It’s a great gig if you have neither principles, skills, nor talents, but this also makes you intensely loyal to the system that is enriching you for no real reason other than to defend it.

If the GOP ever did anything (by accident, obviously) that actually benefitted normal Americans, George Will and his ilk would be righteously indignant. BTW, he should ditch the wig and shave his head. It works for Rogan.

            Goldberg did important missionary work for the religion of antifascism, habituating American conservatives and Republican partisans—people who, the story goes, would become fascists (actual) if the possibility were made available to them—to attach “fascist” to whatever and whomever they don’t like, to hate it and yell it atallthe other guys, from antifa to us.The weakness of on-the-ground MAGA/Trumpism, normal voters’ misunderstanding of what they’re up against, may be more Goldberg’s responsibility than any other living person’s. Every “They callusfascists, but…” from a confused patriot is at least partly his work.Yeah, he’s some dumb schlub, mockable from every angle, an intellectual non-entity and physical joke, jeering out from under his mother’s dress, etc.He was given the job and did it.

        Despite the historical failings of Roman Catholicism, at least it had very few religious Entrepreneurs. The ones who did feature took huge risks – Savanarola, Luther – and even in post-Henry VIII England, plenty got roasted or exiled. America has grown them like corn, to the point where we have post-Jesus types like Joel Osteen. And now in post-God America, we have the political Entrepreneur. He or she worships the State and talks about “due process” and “norms” like Cardinals used to talk about doctrine. The J6ers committed modern blasphemy, hence the reaction. Trump is a convenient Lucifer.

            Righto. The J6ers transgressed a religious shrine, not kidding, can go into detail if necessary but yep, the Capitol Building is a temple, cloaked with the trappings of modern secularism and statism.Just one example: the Capitol is topped, or presided over, by a female figure decked out for combat, variously identified as goddess Libertas, Columbia, Minerva, Athena et al. It ain’t Jesus, put it like that.The Capitol Shrine was installed in 1863. Think of the character of the nation since that time. Is it not a feminist nation of extraordinary warlike nature?An Empowered Shrew of a Nation?  I mean shed a few pounds, that could be Vicky Nuland up on top of that House of Nasty Congress.  The phrase ‘hiding in plain sight’ applies.The J6ers committed rape, and nothing short of that. Therefore due process did not apply to them — because their offense was religious and not secular.

        The worst side effect of prolonged affluence is the growth of deadweight in society. These are people with no motivation to be productive, so they must find another means of sustenance and typically migrate toward busybody occupations. Their stock in trade is talk, but in reality they are lazy. In a perfect world, they would be cast into the void in search of motivation and the imperative to be truly productive. Methinks free-riding is about to become much harder to get away with the coming recession. A necessary cure.

            I remember people making fun of Goldberg for being lazy, too. This was years ago when he was writing “Liberal Fascism.” This guy really just says what he is told to say and rakes in the money. Compare him to Ben Shapiro, who got started around the same time, is younger than Goldberg, also said what he was told to say, and started writing at roughly the same time, and is younger. Look how much farther Ben has gotten, just because unlike Jonah he has a work ethic.

            “motivation and the imperative to be truly productive”
Tom, do you grant that there a significant number of people who, due to their poor genetics or old age, will never be truly productive, no matter how hard they try?
This problem will become increasingly pressing as automation makes the labor of many unnecessary. These people will be willing to sell their labor but no one will want to buy it.
In your vision, what becomes of them?

                Visit Germany sometime and you will see the elderly out sweeping public walks on Saturday morning. This is the spirit of those who would do good no matter their age or disability or employment status. Serving the community is productive, even when the contribution is minor. Its the mindset that counts.

                “These people will be willing to sell their labor but no one will want to buy it.”So far, that’s never happened and I see no reason to think it will any time soon. It’s not just Boomers that have lawn services. In fact, it’s mostly not Boomers anymore. And if you wake up and the neighbor’s poop is in your shower, you just want the poop gone and some kind of a guarantee it won’t happen again. Look at the number of young’uns who can’t or won’t change the oil on their own car, or won’t even pull up a Youtube if the hot water stops.

I’m not a huge fan of the fact I’ve had to teach my daughter how to do home and car repairs, but I’m a friggin’ realist — NO ONE (for almost all values of “NO”) has taught their sons do do it. How is it possible that almost everyone takes their car to the Rapid Oil Change, where they are subject to whatever ROC does to them?

                How could it not? With the extant incentive structure, what other outcome is possible?
Rather than just “noticing”, or even changing small things at the margin, unless the incentive structure is radically reconsidered, nothing changes.

                Pretty sure UMC is a lost cause. Maybe since Wesley started the whole “social justice” thing, but definitely by ’65 when the UMC decided it applies to people who didn’t want to rent to nogs because of their credit records…

            One can hope, but my suspicion was from the get go that Trump is betting the farm on the SCOTUS. His executive orders and the ignoring of the lower courts is a major gamble to (re)establish Executive authority, which is the only possible way to right the ship of state—Congress proven to be a hopeless recourse in the past. Could it really be that the Constitution really is a “mutual death pact”?

                “Could it really be that the Constitution really is a ‘mutual death pact’?”The Z man remains unconvinced, which is sad. (He’s also still confusing nation and union, as in paragraph 2 above.) It’s stunningly obvious that the preamble is a big lie, one of the most influential in human history. It points the way to absurd developments, too.Why, for instance, do some crazies want children to vote? How could anyone hold so moronic an idea? Read the Columbians’ preamble. We have to admit that children are “People”, and thetext claims a unanimity which was not and could never have been. Still, having accepted this much, the implication about children (and other) unfit people having authority follows immediately. Their Con says in effect thatall people, whatever their age and ability, have authority to be their own rulers, to choose their political system, and to impose their foolishness by force. Is this not the practical political ideal of the “Enlightenment”?So why are the people being dragged to destruction? It’s not just the fault of the dirty, rotten Phonecians and their torahs, although the Phonecians do love the USA for what she makes possible. American conservatards are doing it, and the Z man is a man of their millieu.

                Yes, I always thought that was the plan, and he felt like he had a solid enough majority and reasonableness and the plain language of Article II would carry the day. It wasn’t a bad bet, but we can see that #theresistance is spinning up again and Roberts, Comey-Barrett, and even Gorsuch are squishes. It was predictable, I suppose, but I also don’t know what other options Trump had.
If the SCOTUS can’t wrangle in the deep state, then we truly have no hope.

                            Socio-political and familial pressure.  The GOP and Right are feminists and egalitarians too.
Women have dragged the nation ever Leftward since even BEFORE the Nineteenth Amendment.  Presidents (and others) ignore that because even they can’t speak the truth about the ruinous nature of collective female power.
It is a feminist nation, and even ‘conservative’ presidents operate under that rubric.  Not outside of it, where the cold winds of the void blow.

            Well a backup plan might be to continue the summary deportations under one of the many other applicable laws, most passed in the post 9/11 hysteria, and thereby force a restart of the judicial process.   Tom Holman can quote these chapter and verse.  Most just need the Sec of States OK and Rubio has been one of the pleasant surprises.Also: the Constitution need not be a suicide pact.  That position is rather new.  It came, big surprise, from William O. Douglas in one of his first forays into judicial idiocy,  Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 1949.  The lengthy and learned dissent by Jackson ended with the famous declaration:  “[I]f the court does not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.”I hope Trump quotes this if he decides to get spicy.

        Leonard Downie, thePost’sexecutive editor, has killed several of Mr. Hart’s cartoons (the cartoon “B.C.”)because, he says, “We don’t promote individual religions anywhere in the paper. We let people discuss religion as an issue, but we don’t advocate a particular religion.”Well now, that’s swell, isn’t it? “We”—thePost, the other papers, the Anti-Defamation League, and everybody else apparently except the millions of American newspaper readers who actually do advocate particular religions—decide what gets promoted and what doesn’t. Religion, for them, is in the same category—maybe even in a somewhat more taboo category—as outright obscenity and explicit racial epithets. Advocating a specific religious position is forbidden—except, of course, the intensely religious position of secularism…What the elite media deny is not that right in the abstract but any concrete opportunity for Mr. Hart to exercise it. It’s fine to thump your chest about how committed you are to freedom of expression. But when you insinuate that someone is “anti-Semitic” and effectively deny him a place in your newspaper explicitly because of his religious beliefs, your “commitment to free expression” is meaningless.Mr. Hart’s importance does not lie in the truthfulness of his beliefs or even in the clever ways he expresses them. Rather, it lies in the fact that simply by expressing them he helps expose the Big Lies of “tolerance,” “diversity,” and “freedom” that the media chieftains are always yapping about. There is tolerance, diversity, and freedom for those views of which the elite media approve. For those views they don’t like and don’t want to publish—and explicit Christian commitments are among them—the media send a very clear exclusionary messageSam Francis

            It’s interesting that both churches preach some doctrine of original sin. Your problem is a matter of subjective tastes and preferences. You want vanilla ice cream, not chocolate. Wine, not beer. Roasted corn on a cob, not creamed corn out of a can.

                This bit about original sin is true. And probably True. Since Easter is recently passed, it’s worth considering His words in Gethsemane — not that they were flawed humans, tainted by Original Sin, rather that the spirit was willing but the flesh weak. Not the worthless pathetic sinners that many denominations preach, but rather that they were inherently weak, and in need of help.

A wave of demonetization recently hit thousands of the marginally “based,” from Carl Benjamin to Japanese cartoon girls, for, the accusations say, fraud.Whatfraud? No response.

                Search engine “optimization” predates AI by a bit and isn’t directly related. That was just the next step in pay to play and executive censorship the capital ‘N’ Net Neutrality folks were all worried about in 2010 and then pretended wasn’t happening in 2015 when it was people they liked doing it in spite of the rules they wanted being in force. All pretense was dropped after that got repealed, and the AI component was grafted on later, after which what workarounds I’d discovered stopped working pretty rapidly.

        It’s the damnedest thing, isn’t it?A couple years back we had this guest speecher from down in the States visit our little chapel out in the country and he was to do the honors one Sunday. Cool, I thought, our regular elders do a good job of preaching and it might be interesting to listen to a new voice.Well this little prick gets up there, starts waving his fat little fists around, shouting admonishments and accusations at us and lecturing us like we were all disobedient 9 year olds. Within 5 minutes I was gritting my teeth, listening to this sanctimonious goof – and at ten minutes in I just stood up on my hind feet and walked out! I’d heard enough.I got reamed right out by the Elders the next week, for being extremely rude. I asked them why they took it? Our people were really good folks, and that guy had no business talking to them like that. I asked them what they were thinking by even inviting him to speak? But… I was the only one that took it that way. They patiently explained to me that there were different styles of evangelism and that was just how this guy did things.People WANT preachers and scolds. They’ll pay through the nose and hang on their every word. They’ll line up ten deep for the chance to jump through Jonah Goldberg’s hoops, or fetch the stick for David Fwench.I think the only way to end the scourge of these guys is as proposed by some of the old NRx crowd. Round them up, lock them into the churches and chain the doors shut – and then set it on fire and shoot any that manage to climb out trying to avoid the flames.Salting the earth on the ground after they burn down is probably a good idea too.

No, abusers and masochists want scolds, though surely for different reasons. You showed up for service that day to be scolded, same as any pious, orthodox triadolater ever has. You rebelled bc the denigration was stronger than you prefer. It was a matter of flavor intensity, or you were put off by the sweetness or sourness of the beverage served. The Elders had you and your religion figured out better than you understand.

                Really.
I don’t think you have any idea of what a real preacher is or why a Christian would listen to them. I’ll chalk that up to the fact that you are obviously a product of a world that is fake and gay.

        I do not thing that what we are dealing with are neo Great Awakening cult leaders out in the middle of nowhere taking advantage of near total geographic isolation absent of most civilizational, (Old World), amenities herding people into their quackery.On the one hand we have a bunch of Friar Savonarolas in pink hair and draped in foreign flags. On the other we have people like Goldberg who isn’t a preacher. He is a liar. He is paid to say anything, no matter how untrue, to get the empire to do the bidding of those who pay him to lie.Between all of them they are creating massive amounts of mayhem. I am in a foul mood after spending a bunch of time tumbling down the rabbit hole of looking at the extent of our dispossession. Were it that the imperialists ran us to standard ruin that we could suffer under and then rise again that would be one thing. But, when you look at the scale of the crime of giving everything we had away and then willfully conditioning us to accept it, and to even accept genocide and to forgive remorseless murderers who can kill us with impunity, it is just something that makes you want to explode.I think these reforms are going to fail. The numbers of people and numbers of rackets are just too great in number and the diffusion of the dispossessors and patrons is way too wide and far to reform. Well, it could happen, but you need a reformer whose primary goal isn’t running a business but saving a civilization.In the end, 180 million people forsaken and whose country was and still is handed away to foreigners both at the bottom and at the top are going to wake up and realize the full scale of the crime. A day is coming when 90 million White men will realize that everything was taken from them and that they have nothing left to lose.

            “on the cuck right”
Is there any other right in the USA?
Afaik, there are no so-called dissidents hiding out in the legislatures, keeping their heads down, subverting the Great Mistake and its fake “supreme Law”. If you have no representation in their evil system, you’re not even on the pitifully narrow, one-dimensional axis labeled left, right, and center. Instead, you’re another one of the losers being deleted, like that kid who was beaten recently near Frisco, Texas.

Thing is, they don’t need to, nor would it be to their advantage. Doing so would at least turn them into “Common Causers” Democrats. Who won’t reward them with cash and prizes for siding with them.
There is just no reason for them to stick their heads up to get chopped off. I doubt you are offering them a comfortable sinecure if they stink up the Capitol, are you?

        It seems like the Trump administration needs to basically ignore the law – or at the very least, these jackoff judges, many of whom aren’t even real Americans.  Further, the proselytizing and hypocritical preachers need to be rounded up and sent someplace worse than their “churches”.
