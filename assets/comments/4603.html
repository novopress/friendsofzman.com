        Everyone – or at least all those outside the Cult – laughed at the  hypocrisy of labeling Zimmerman a “white Hispanic.”
But see how wonderfully useful the white Hispanic is!  Makes Hispanics white as if by magic!
Sometimes lies are useful.  And sometimes lies are just plain necessary.

            …No Wei Ho say:The Tejas Dept of Public Safety has dropped the “Hispanic”part of the designation entirely.Check out the stated races of these ne’er do wells:Texas 10 Most Wanted Fugitiveshttp://www.txdps.state.tx.us/Texas10MostWanted/fugitives.aspxNot a Hispanic in the bunch. Just “White Males &amp; Black Males”.
If even the Texas Rangers are afraid to identify these folks correctlywhat chance does reality have?
Remember too, that our FBI keeps no stats for Hispanic criminals.They’re all just listed as white.

                I see a chameleonish tint to this Hispanic thing. When they are bad they are White; when they are pitiable they are Brown.

        …“faculty lounge Kabbalah.”
Sorry Z… It’s just too obscure.I had to read your post twice to figure out where you were trying to go.
On the other hand, your creation, “the Pale Penis People” (PPP)has a real chance to become a permanent part our lexicon, at least in the HBDosphere.
One word that I would like to see added to our modern descriptive lexicon is ‘feralization’ to describe places like Fergamore.Come to think of it, ‘Fergamore’ isn’t bad either.
