        “Chief Judge Roberts could step in, but he is clearly blobbed up…”
The problem with Roberts is he is a cuck.  Like all the cucks in Congress,  when his vote doesn’t count, he upholds Conservative views.  But the second his vote counts, like when the other judges are 4-4, he cucks and votes with the left.

            Pretty much all of them are cucks except Alito and Thomas, and Thomas in particular is as good as it gets. Never in my wildest imagination did I expect that the most brilliant Supreme Court justice of my lifetime would be an affirmative action Negro falsely accused of sexual harassment, but the guy is rock solid on constitutional principles. He is actually better than Scalia.
I’d take a Supreme Court with nine Clarence Thomases on it in a heartbeat.

                He really surprised me coming down on the right side of affirmative action.
That godawful woman with the adopted African kids, IIRC, already has voted the wrong way influenced by her adopted keedz.  She literally cucked her own children.  Every minute of attention and dollar spent on those africans are a minute and dollar she cannot give to her own children.  It’s DISGUSTING!  She should divorce her husband and marry David French.

                    “He really surprised me coming down on the right side of affirmative action.”I expected that, based on his autobiography. His grandpa delivered coal to homes, and had a huge influence on Clarence. I don’t remember the details of Clarence’s parents, but it seems to me they were stereotypical negros, and their kids needed to be saved from that.His grandpappy drilled into him the ideas of honor and trustworthiness, a day’s work for a day’s pay, and all that. His grandpappy deplored his kinsmen for giving negros a bad name.The sole surprise in the book was how ardently he pursued his time in EEOC. He rationalized it as giving a good day’s work etc., but in later chapters, it was obvious that he thought he had betrayed the principles his Grandpa instilled.

                J. Thomas greeted me with a handshake and hug and we have socialized since the day I was sworn into SCOTUS Trial Bar. He still retains a keen memory, including what they did to him during confirmation. He’s a great American and jurist.

                    Excellent, he is truly a good man and understands the founding principles of this nation better than any judge I have ever seen.It’s truly sickening that a man of his intellect has has to serve on an appeals court where his “equals” are literal morons like the “Wise Latina” and Ketanji from Uganda…

            Muh guess is that Roberts is much more of a pederast than merely a “cuck”.
Jeffrey Epstein purchased a couple of children out of Southern Ireland, so that Roberts would be able to LARP as a father &amp; a family man.
Roberts needed fake children to pull off the ruse, and Epstein was happy to oblige.
[Shades of Elizabeth Edwards getting third-party eggs to make John Edwards look like more of a virile young family man.]
It’s almost impossible for us Normies to grok how cynical these soulless power-hungry monsters really are.

            It has been said that Roberts has a greater concern than that of applying the Constitution in his rulings.  That is to say, he is running scared and tailors his decisions as to what he perceives is in the best interest of the institution—SCOTUS.  He perhaps is keenly aware of the weakness (power imbalance and Constitutional underpinnings) of the “third branch of government”!
This has always puzzled me.  Seems he is more aware of the limits of the judiciary than our Legislative and Executive branches.  Time to rein in the Judiciary, they are a paper tiger.

        Federal districts can be eliminated and defunded by simple majority votes, but of course as you point out Republicans are perfectly fine with what is happening. It seems the Trump Administration has decided upon a mixed Cloward-Piven strategy, though, where it claims to follow an order, does not do so and proceeds to destroy things. This is a good tactic. What has been done to USAID, for example, is Cloward-Piven at its finest. It took decades to build the monster and it will be very difficult to reconstitute.

            So much this.
Rush Limbaugh liked to say that you could just set out rakes and let Liberals step on them. Which I think (and thought ) that was the reason Homan and Trump focused on deporting the worst of the worst first. If those planes were full of Juanita and the ninos, the majority of people would have folded to their emotions and supported Boasberg. But only the absolute lunatic fringe would insist that we needed those particular people because they do the jobs Americans just won’t do, like murder, rape and setting people on fire.

                I’m all for setting precedent wrt deportations and it makes good publicity here and South of the border.  But the majority of IA’s are not gang member’s.  If the deportation raids slow down, nothing will change.  Admittedly, I’m a cynic.  Let’s pick up this discussion a year from now for evaluation of the deportation promise made by Trump.   😉

                    Agreed.
I’m pretty sure Juanita and the ninos will still be here. Americans aren’t in the mental space to bump them. Not yet, maybe not ever. But at least we got rid of a few Trendy Arugulas. Had they not gone after those guys first, we’d still have them, too.

            They’re also invoking the State Secrets Act to tell the judge he has no need to know.  They can now proceed with deportation flights and when the judge starts sending them orders, just reply “We can’t discuss it.  National security.”The Jeffrey Goldberg thing points to another way Team Trump is doing things differently.  Goldberg claims he was sent a Signal chat invite by the National Security Advisor (Walz).  What single guy in the Administration is more of a threat to the IC than Walz?  This position is why they took out General Flynn in 2017.  They set Flynn up and got him fired.  They’re trying the same thing with Walz.Walz is a threat.  But also, SIGNAL is a threat.  The subtext of the minor scandal is that Hegseth, Rubio, Walz, and others in Trump’s circle are using Signal to communicate.  Why would they need to use an encrypted Signal app when they all have JWICS, SIPRNet, CWAN, and other very highly classified/encrypted networks?  Because those networks are controlled and monitored by the IC.  That is NOT ALLOWED by the Deep State.  So they concoct an invite to a Signal chat they know about…maybe used a loyal mole inside the White House to make it look like the invite came from Walz.That’s not going to work this time…even the SSCI hearing which is how they’ll try to turn it into a scandal…won’t go anywhere.  Walz isn’t going anywhere.  And now the White House likely has a lead on a mole on the National Security Council team…somebody in a position to send the chat invite to Goldberg pretending to be from Walz.This stuff isn’t new and it isn’t original and it isn’t clever.  In fact, like the judges, it is incredibly easy to spot and that is what is leading to furious Democrats torching lithium battery powered Tesla’s.

                I can’t believe you’re pushing Q-tier, ‘the white hats are in charge’ copium like this to try to say Trump and his team are fighting the deep state.  I don’t understand why a grown man needs to create these narratives to justify his support for what is turning out to be another dud from the Trump admin.  Tell me how these apparatchiks discussing their plans to bomb Yemeni civilians is fighting the deep state?  It’s Waltz btw, not Walz, but can you tell me how this guy (an acolyte of Donald Rumsfeld) is actually on our side and fighting the intelligence community?  Genuinely befuddled why you feel the need to proclaim this nonsense, it’s not convincing and makes you sound like a stooge.

Thanks much for the ‘protege of Rumsfeld’ info, but if you’re going to fight one gang, you’d better have an equally formidable gang at your back. That both are factions of Horace’sinternational civil waris a different subject.
That the Atlantic leak is a ‘story’? I mean, come on.Might as well just use MAD Magazine ‘Spy vs. Spy’ comic strips.

                    I’m sorry, Waltz. Everybody loves that guy on the internet spell checking everyone.IDGAF what they were talking about.  Use your head.  This is an attempt to remove Trump’s NSA like they did with Flynn in 2017.  They, meaning the IC and SSCI, also don’t like Team Trump using Signal to evade domestic surveillance on the DoD networks.But if you want to talk about the Houthis, fine.  Sometimes you end a war by walking away (Iraq, Afghanistan, to some extent Ukraine).  Sometimes you end it by killing everyone (ISIS, Houthis).  The return of the Rules Based Order means the US ensures freedom of navigation globally.  “Anyone who shoots anti ship missiles at cargo ships or the US Navy, gets killed.”Don’t forget to wipe off your screen.

                    Maybe, and that was CLEARLY the impression we were meant to have.  “Why would Waltz have neocon Goldberg on his contact list?”
But my preference is that Waltz is viewed as a threat.  He’s been great.  RUBIO has been terrific.  This was a neocon attempt to take him out using an NSC mole.

                My thoughts exactly.
The Signal app was a carefully laid trap and the Trump administration just triggered it without losing anything of consequence.
Now his cabinet can circumvent its use for National Security reasons, in favor of the more secure, traditional meeting methods.

                    They’ll expand Signal use.  This incident proves it is secure because the IC and SSCI just tried to force Team Trump to stop using it.The difference will be better verification of participant identities, which is easily done.The whole point of this op was to try and remove one or more Trump cabinet members.  Waltz seems to have been the primary target.  AND to get them to stop using Signal.Why?  Because the “traditional methods” you write about ARE NOT SECURE inside the firewall.  The IC can spy on JWICS to their heart’s content.  They apparently cannot penetrate Signal in a way that would let them spy on that chat.

        Being a judge has benefits beyond renumeration.  When you are a judge, everyone in the legal (and regulatory) world will kiss your butt because of the power you hold.
I remeber a retired judge told me the worst thing about being retired is that no one returns your phone calls.  That’s why these judges, state and federal, want to hang on to their positions like the pope.

            One judge wrote to me that after being called Your Honor a few thousand times, he had to check himself at the start of each day, to make sure his vanity was under control.  He said it’ll get to ya.
Now many judges are female, so the tendency towards grandeur and social preening has increased tenfold.

                    My dad retired from medicine 35 years ago, and was aghast at how bad the practice had become. I tried to talk him into canceling and going somewhere else for a routine stent when 2 surgical assistants and one anesthesiologist couldn’t get a simple IV going, when I could see the vein from halfway across the room. The boob trying to put in the stent shoved his instrument right through the wall of the femoral, backed up to get a run at it, then through the wall of the aorta.Died at home a month later, but I could tell by his second day in ICU that this was last call.One of the reasons I don’t worry that much about the collapse of Medicare. It’ll probably add years to my life.

I understand El Salvador recently purged its judiciary too. It’s a problem that’s endemic to western civ countries right now. Hopefully they can be removed peacefully but I’m good either way. Without functional laws your country can’t work…

Bukele got a super-majority so he replaced the Supreme Court. It is true that his methods implied a somewhat creative interpretation of the law, but he ensured that the army was close to the Supreme Court when the previous judges tried to play Masada 2.0

                        Took bold, masculine action from Bukele in order to restore his country. First breaking the power of organized crime, then cleansing the judiciary.Is this dangerous?  Yeah it’s dangerous, esp. the judiciary part.  But unchecked gang rule is worse than national death.  It’s national enslavement.The narcotraficantes are looking for virgin territories in latin america with built-in markets for hard drugs. That means tourist towns, especially beach hamlets.I hope these nations do not wait until the Bukele Stage to crush their domestic narco organizations. Many L.A. nations simply are not ready, nor do they understand that you either go Bukele, or you go Mexico, take your pick.

                    He did it the same way we can – he won the Legislature and they voted to get rid of the courts.
All the right people opposed it, which means they know it’s going to work. Bukele is massively popular there.
He and Trump are friendly. Trump knows this is an option, but he needs a bigger House majority.
The US government claiming that “an independent judiciary” is important is the tell.  Independent = unelected and unaccountable.  Most of the horrific damage done to this country since the 1950’s has been imposed on Americans by the courts.

            That’s true on a lot of levels.  And it’s why a lot of people get into politics and government – to be a somebody.
Heck, when I was President of my neighborhood HOA for 2 years, everybody kissed my ass.  Nobody actually likes you.  They just think they need to do that so I wouldn’t mess with them…something that never once crossed my mind.  Spent most of my 2nd year eliminating stupid rules from the covenants and getting everyone to vote to go along with it.

        Don’t know if it’s been pointed out, but as long as one side simply ignores laws, with no resulting consequences,(Sanctuary cities, not enforcing immigration laws,etc), while the other side plays by the rules,(we must engage out of control judges in the court system), nothing will improve, and over time, will get worse.
Is there any reason the current administration can’t simply ignore radical, woke judges?
What can they do? Get mad?Write a sternly worded letter?

            The problem with ignoring judges is the recalcitrant federal “workforce” that is insubordinate to the president to begin with. When some judge rules that they don’t have to obey Order X from the president, then they have a legal leg to stand on to disobey. They probably weren’t going to obey anyway, or drag their feet, but now the president’s order has been effectively blocked. Sometimes, in some cases, the WH can effectively ignore the courts and pretend they don’t exist, but I believe such instances are in the minority. For the most part, for the executive to function, it needs buy in (or at least obedience) from the underlings. This is the real fruit of capture of the institutions.

        Most of the lawyers who end up being judges start to get involved in politics early. They usually are donating time and money to parties and campaigns in their 20s. These types don’t want to be actual lawyers. They want to be in politics one way or the other and being a judge is one of those ways.
Successful lawyers either don’t want to be a judge or can’t afford it because they’re lifestyle now requires making $500k a year.

        Funny how we’re returning to a medieval conception of the law. The Blob relies on compurgation — you’re in the right because you pinkie swear you are, and you’ve got twelve guys who will swear they believe you. That’s the sole principle behind so much of the lawfare — some Apparatchik swears that Trump is a big poopy-head, and twelve of his buddies swear they believe him, and therefore it’s unconstitutional (for any and all values of “it”).

        Perhaps one way out of this conundrum is to have Trump give a pre-emptive pardon to everyone involved in deportations and DOGE, and then let them ignore the courts.  It sounds crazy, but no crazier than Biden pardoning all his lackeys and lickspittles for anything they might ever have done.

        ‘In the even longer run, normalizing the judiciary means the end of ideology, because as long as we remain an ideological state, there will be people who see themselves as priests tasked with enforcing the moral claims of the ideology’The courts historically are subject to graft and to lesser extent, nepotism . . . human nature being what it is.  What’s new the past four decades is the ‘political nepotism’ ubiquitous in both trial and appellate courtrooms.I worked in court admin, and for a state supreme court, in the Eighties and Nineties.  Back then girls were pouring out of law schools, having been enticed with, as usual, preferential selection, loans etc.  They’ve had 40 years to build their army and a concomitant judicial hive which includes court clerks, judicial admin, and adjunct personnel.Those heavily politicized women of the Seventies to present — waging righteous war against the (nonexistent) Ebil Ebil White Male Patriarchy — are the trial court judges now deciding whether you go to prison or go home.  Largely, male judges go along with the Feminist Jurisprudence now rampant at the bench.This isn’t the only ideological element present in the judicial system, of course.  I’m just focusing on the most pernicious element.  To sum, it’s the capturing of the courts by the religion and forces of evil.

                The Achilles Heel of the largely male Right always is the Woman Question. Typically, conservative men fail, and bigly. The Right desperately needs leaders like Z who are Based concerning female collective power.All real Christians and Traditionalists face the realities of female nature, or they are simply entryists, fifth columns, or Con. Inc. scammers.Even the Bible tells us that the enemy of our age is the ‘female adversary’ or ‘female rival wife’, dependent upon translation.

        The task of a reactionary utopian is simply to pull his head out of his immediate environment and look to religion, philosophy, history and art for intimations of how social life ought to be.A decent man should always be somewhat alienated from the herd, from the age he lives in, from the dominant political gangs. When you feel at home in a world that has gone wrong, you’ve gone wrong too.Not that you should be an anti-social hermit (though you shouldn’t rule that out too quickly). But at least you should keep a free mind, a mental and spiritual space that is all your own, unpenetrated by official lies and propaganda.The tyrant really wants your soul — he speaks solicitously of “raising your consciousness” — but you don’t have to yield it to him. That’s the one private property he can’t take away from you.Joseph Sobran

            This is a marvelous citation. Thanks for posting. And I particularly like this, “When you feel at home in a world that has gone wrong, you’ve gone wrong too.”
Funny, but while having lunch a while ago it dawned upon me that, in my own words, the only decent place in which to live in AINO is under a rock. Were Sobran around today, I believe he would concur.

        Eventually, violent overthrow of the system may become inevitable. Over six hundred district judges may be too many when you are trying to work within the system, but they are nothing in a bloody coup.
Of course, this kind of things only happen in backwards Latin American or African countries and not in the center of civilization that is the US.

        I made a similar comment  in the past but you know everyone of these politicized judges have immediate family, relatives, and close friends who collected shady USAID/NGO money. Trump has to go on the offensive and start arresting their wives, children and golf buddies to put pressure on them. If Trump doesn’t break the deep state by the time he leaves office it could  be literally fatal for him and his family if he fails.

        The main difference between the MSM and the federal bench is the lifetime appointment. Although it’s practically impossible anymore for undesirables to make it through the elaborate and lengthy screening process (for either) without being flagged, apostasy happens. “Journalists” can just be Tucker Carlson’d or Sheryl Atkisson’d, but judges, when they become problematic, well, I’m betting some of them have been dealt with more harshly than the general public knows or would believe. And I bet that the district court judge position is already more temporary than is statutorily claimed. Remains a mystery how Alito made it all the way to the high court and remains there, but I guess he’s an example of someone who sort of got grandfathered in before the process became as refined as it is.

            Yes. The primary purpose of the Ivies, for example, is to screen for the Regime rather than to educate. While the ABA was hot garbage and tossed as an evaluator of judges, the Federal Society is just as craptacular and continues to screen out those who might be problematic. It is interesting that you mention both the MSM and the judiciary together. While the former has imploded, it appears the public perception of the latter is shifting to hostile and dismissive as well. What is happening will speed this along.

                    Case in point: in the Nineties, and it may still be true, once admitted to Yale Law you were guaranteed no less than a B average regardless of performance and attendance. There were literal no-show students. This may have come into being for shadier reasons, if you catch my drift, and in effect was a precursor to DEI. I shudder to think about the med students.

        Just one more example, as if any more are needed, why virtually every position in the federal government system needed to have term limits.  That may not even work, but without them, there’s no fricking chance to rein in the fraud, shenanigans and otherworldly corruption.

            Andrew Jackson back in the 1820’s-30’s found that he needed to clean the bureaucratic stables.  It wasn’t only that he wanted to put kindred spirits in–there was already incompetence and corruption there.  Now we have “labor unions” and regulations that weren’t in place in his day, blocking such a cleansing, along with the judges.  Maybe your term limits idea can help, along with an overhaul of the federal bureaucratic employment system.

                The reason for lifetime appointments was to increase judicial impartiality.  This of course is a fallacy.  An appointment of a given number of years will do so just fine.  One should not continue with a process that was developed in the late 1700’s when a ripe old age was surviving to 60 yo.

                    Strictly speaking, not lifetime, but good behavior.
The Midnight Judges Act aka Judicial Act of 1801 is instructive. That was self-evidently intended to stack the court, and not just the SC, and resulted in the end of what, if you squinted just right, you could still kind of identify as a republic. Not only did the bastard Adams work overtime to try to fill the new seats with Federalists who would block every effort by the D-Rs, it resulted in the atrocious Marbury decision.

                        Steve.   Good behavior is difficult to measure and enforce.  Here in AZ we still have judicial appointments that are put up every election for public vote, i.e., vote “yes” for retention.  To my recollection there has never been a non-retention—even when judicial misconduct was proven and widely publicized. (This process has been slated for removal just because of this fact.  It may have been passed recently for all I know)When you have “good conduct” as a criteria, you will inevitably have gaming of the system.  Consider everyone corrupt and limit them to a fixed term.  What—there are not enough “good” people to fill the extra slots that come up with term limits.  Doubtful.  If that’s the case, it makes no difference.

        As a foreigner I find your constitution fascinating; no wonder people are devoted to studying it. (The contrast with the lame Declaration of Independence is striking.)I have several questions about it e.g. when the powers of a monarch were given to the president why were they typical of the powers of an early 17th century monarch rather than the much more restricted powers held by such a “tyrant” as George III?  But to today’s business:-“Checks and balances” are all very well but what is the final check on (i) the custom of the Supreme Court choosing to act as a legislative body, according to the whim of the Justices, and (ii) the whole American tendency to accord preposterous power and wealth to lawyers? Both are obviously unhealthy but what can be done about them?

            I often have recommended a Cloward-Piven strategy of eliminating the lower or “inferior” courts and so overwhelming the rest of the system it implodes. Congress actually can do this via elimination of districts court systems, which are not required by the Constitution, and/or defunding them. It appears the Administration has decided on a modified response that amounts to claiming to follow court orders, not doing so, and keeping the judges busy overseeing them. That’s smart even if the legislative method would be quicker.

                        Family Courts are feminist star-chambers; nothing less than the enemies of God and men.I watched the judicial admin for the Family Courts organize, grow and empower during the Eighties.Family Court is an enormous grift between the Herd (collective femininity) and a branch of the court system, to steal billions of dollars — and the lives that go with it — from men en masse.It’s been a slaughter.  Men and kids live in the wake of the feminist-destroyed family unit, but the Courts and the Grrls are doing just fine!  Sufficiently wealthy that the entire mercantile nation panders to them.

            In answer to your inquiry (i): I’m trying to remember the famous person who was quoted posing the question, “Does the Supreme Court command an army?” (Andrew Jackson?) The final check on the Court’s legislative usurpations would be other sufficiently strong institutional powers ignoring the Court’s decisions and essentially saying, “What are you [the judges] gonna do about it?” I suppose a Constitutional Amendment could be passed to try to place stricter limits on the Court, but that would be an extremely difficult endeavor to pull off.As to your inquiry (ii): That would require a massive cultural sea change that is unfathomable at present. In fact, it’s possible nothing short of a civilizational collapse and subsequent rebuild could possibly thwart the prerogatives of modern lawyers.

                The quietly ignore the lawyers option appears to be a recent and popular development. That includes by the Presidency. It ultimately undermines the rule of law, but something has to give.As a personal for instance, I’m part of a scouting alternative group that shall go unnamed. They have lawyers and it shows. However, frankly as an on the ground volunteer, wanting a good experience for my child and the other participants, I generally blow off the more impractical rules/forms so obviously meant to protect the national organization.It’s annoying because I have to decipher the intent versus the bean counter/control freak effect. Some of the rules are common sense and good practice all around. Others are clearly about a lawyer being a lawyer who never participated in such activities. If pushed, I’ll just stop volunteering. That effect ties I and II together.

            ” … the whole American tendency to accord preposterous power and wealth to lawyers?”In any country with the so-called “rule of law”–a thing that does not even exist and never has existed b/c men rule over other men, and “the law” is the law only when and if enforced, and it is men who do the enforcing or don’t–things can function only when there is a homogeneous society with an intact culture and traditions that say, “this is how we do things; this is ‘done’ among us, and that is ‘not done.&#x27;” And if a society does not have that, then only law–by which I mean force–can keep things from falling apart.And since America has for decades now not had such an intact culture, the law becomes the only means of holding things together, which means that lawyers get lots of money for manipulating words on a piece of paper and by bamboozling “voters,”who, of course, are the members of all juries. And, of course, manipulating the common herd with empty slogans, one of which is “the rule of law.”Great work if you can get it.

                There was a case in South Carolina in 1937, pitting two black sharecroppers – who’d discovered a small fortune of buried gold coins on the land they worked, against white plaintiffs whose predecessors owned that land and had buried the gold. Slam dunk for the plaintiffs, right?
Nope, the ruling was for the sharecroppers. In 1937. In South Carolina.
I’ve always gotten a kick out of this little factoid from the past, as it demonstrates that the stereotype of southern “justice” is exactly that, a stereotype. There were men – judges- who took “the rule of law” seriously.

            Dearieme, you’ll need to study a bit more in depth. Congress does have power over the judiciary, albeit rarely done.
“While Congress can influence the scope of federal court jurisdiction, there are limits to its authority. It cannot directly dictate how courts must decide individual cases, as this would violate the separation of powers. Congress can only shape the courts’ ability to hear certain cases or categories of issues, not interfere with judicial independence.”
I myself would like to see more control of the Courts via such as the Constitution outlines.

                “It cannot directly dictate how courts must decide individual cases, as this would violate the separation of powers.”Pretty sure the reason is that would be a bill of attainder, but they may not do so nonetheless.What Congress could do, but refuses to do, is enact legislation to fix whatever abomination the courts did. Doesn’t affect that case, obviously, but all future cases have to bear the new rules in mind. They could easily enforce the rules that apply to tax evasion to immigration evasion, and the courts couldn’t do anything but whine.If they can’t stand up for Americans, f them.

                    My understanding is that Congress can direct what matters the Court can rule on and what not.  (Crudely put). If so, I’d like to see more push back from Congress.  Of course, that won’t happen because at least one party sees the (poz’d) Judiciary as an arrow in their quiver.  Yes, they may not have control of SCOTUS now, but soon enough they will and then they’ll use them to their advantage once again.

            As an American: Americans interact with the Constitution via “magic paper” thinking. English descendants can cling to their idealizations/fantasies long after reality has manifested itself. There’s nothing to “study” with the Constitution. It’s what a few pages long? If someone studies it, they will discover whatever was written pre-1800 has almost nothing to do with what people pretend the constitution is today.The only votes that count are the black robed collective among us, a reality that has existed for as long as I have alive. The belligerent to impossible to govern attitude of many of the American natives means that they lawyer up all the time. Americans are for consensus when they agree. They are against it when they don’t.Europeans often look “sheep like” to Americans. The endless rebellion of the Americans is not without cost. One of them is a litigious society, in which frankly the Jews can flourish in. We and England have been easy marks because we can’t control ourselves.

        “…in 1985, US District Court Judge Russell Clark began a terror campaign against the people of Missouri. He took over the Kansas City, Missouri School District,…”Judge Clark has nothing on us here in Tucson, AZ.  Our largest public school district, TUSD, entered a “desegregation decree” in 1978 and has now officially exited the decree in 2025!  Basically because there were no longer any, or enough, Whites left in the public school system to bus/transfer around to the schools in the system.The TUSD School Board fought hard to remain under the deseg decree since this allowed them the unrestricted raising of school assessment taxes to meet the decree’s mandate.  Eventually our court system finally had to surrender to reality when (after years and years of hearings) they admitted that there basically were no Whites left to facilitate the original order—nor could Whites be brought back into the public school system via any means not already tried.Desegregation in this burg made the school system even more segregated!  This is a major reason why the teacher’s unions fight tooth and nail to eliminate all forms of schooling outside of the public school system.  Given a choice, all caring parents will leave the (public) system.  We certainly did.

            My nephew and niece attended one of the most elite private schools in the area, if not the most. They’re both good kids, but down to earth they are not. They rub elbows with the children of the upper middle class and that kind of segregation worries me. They don’t have exposure to regular people.I agree with our host. He said on one of the podcasts that he never felt completely comfortable with the upper middle class crowd. I’m kind of the same way. I’m a little too off the wall. I enjoy being around people who can appreciate a bawdy joke.There’s also something to be said by having your children exposed to people of various backgrounds and depending on the school you go to, you don’t always get that.

                Nothing could be further from your observation (slur?) of elitism in private, or really, non-public schools.  If you do not have children, you might investigate further those who do—or refrain from comment.Here in AZ, there are similar states as well, the alternatives are “Home Schooling”, “Total private (elite snob) schools”, “Charter Schools”.  The State now helps with such alternatives vis a vis tuition and tax rebate for such—even home schooling. So most all these alternatives have a goodly helping of “dirt people”.My children actually went to the one “public’ school in those years dedicated to the best and brightest as well as Charter Schools prior.  That school has since been destroyed by the local School Board, but when it was active the way they handled your concern was to separate classes into gifted/normal and merge/mix  students in *all* other activities such as arts, sports, cafeteria, etc.  Admittedly wife and I were concerned as well as to elitism wrt selective schools.Currently, my son’s brother-in-law has his child in the best private school in the area.  The tuition costs more per year than at my old university. He works as a machinist!  This is admittedly in no small part due to grants and State voucher funding.  All alternative schools I am aware of here go to great lengths to refrain from elitism outside of academic ability.  This is not some Leftist hell hole like NYC—despite the majority Hispanic population.  Hispanics love their children as well and will do what it takes to get them out of public schools.

                    My brother would disagree with you. My nephew is in college now, but in high school he only had one friend from a normal background. Everybody else was doctors lawyers and other kind of muckety mucks. That was the overwhelming majority of people at his school. It’s a different world from what I (and my brother) experienced and not only because times have changed.

            Occasionally I get the newsletter from my first high school. I remember the riots, and how the blacks went on a continuous polar bear hunt at night.
Now, they’re gone. I don’t know if I could find the white kid in the last 15 years, it seemed all those young faces were a uniform Mexican brown. Some Sikh are edging in.

        Blackpill: the Court system is a deliberate agonist to any attempt to change or restrict the Blob. The shysters can outlast any meaningful attempt at reform.Whitepill: when we inevitably go bankrupt, the massive graft and fugazy of our legal system will get necessarily reformed. Things are not as bad as they look, because if we got rid of deadbeat illegals, pettifogging lawyers, NATO and the massive overhead of unproductive government, we could be rich again. The system survives despite almost every effort by the Blob to kill it.

        it won’t be long before judges and lawyers are (mostly) replaced by AI.  this is one area that is simple enough, and clear enough for current AI technology to be effective.  this of course could also be gamed, but the evidence of this would be easy to spot (“hey, who changed this code?”) compared to a compromised human judge.

            This already has happened with contract law. If both parties stipulate facts, which often happens anyhow, the software reviews case law, statutes, and common law and renders a decision. You are right that this will expand. The only problem that remains is assessing the credibility of witnesses and relatedly in the criminal context the right to face one’s accusers. But, yeah, the legal system as constituted isn’t long for it due to technology.

                …. and of course this necessitates examination of the question of who programs the AI. The enemies behind the Great Replacement are genociding us, slowly but deliberately. They steal, cheat, and lie not just with abandon, but with relish and joy.Of course they will rig judicial AI in their favor. (Rather, they will have to import more Bharati to do it for them.) We should not be taking the usual conservative route of simply preventing them from cheating, which is just another manifestation of the conservative role as the regime’s janitor cleaning up progressive mess. We should actively and aggressively cheat, too.Moreover, even if one has an AI that is fair deciding a case according to law, WHOSE LAW? Law is an extension and codification of ethic mores. We have not been ruled over by Heritage American law at the Federal (imperial) level in my lifetime. If they are anybody’s, the laws put on the books over the last 12 years are an extension of Ashkenazi Jewish mores. Our Founding Fathers would not recognize any of it as an extension of their project. Even a fair AI is just a bandaid on a sucking gunshot wound.

        Nice. Of course, who are the people is the question that supercedes all of this. Demographic destruction already seems to indicate that we cannot agree upon who we are. The coming economic climate will probably exacerbate those divisions and contending claims. If you look at it, a 90% white 10% black population couldn’t agree on the legitimacy of the legal system. Once the majority was stripped of its moral authority and then legally stripped of its ability to enforce them, the minority showed that they do not consider the legal system of the 90% who are now what, 54% and headed into demographic winter.I don’t see this being resolved without an explicitly stated agreement amongst the public that this must be reversed. We can’t have open and honest conversations. Name calling, rioting and litigation will shut it down. That leaves a Caesar, but in a country with no clear majority, whose Caesar will that be.Things don’t look good on this front.

        here’s an interesting paradox:
The country is less white, and the whites here are more deracinated, less likely to be married with kids by the age of 30, less religious, more homosexual and more likely to work in a postindustrial “new economy”
Yet the republican party has a lot more downballot power than it did from 1933 to 1995. It’s like there’s a weird thing where you have two trends at odds with each other – you’d think the trends would converge.

        Doing a turn as a district judge should be viewed as a resume builder for someone on partner track at a big firm or maybe as a career builder for a lawyer who wants to build his own firm. District judges were supposed to handle mundane administrative tasks to free up the superior court.First thing Z, jumping off the “Partner Track” in any Big Law or “White Shoe” law firm once you’re hired in is career suicide. So trundling off to do a stint as a State or Federal District judge isn’t going to fly. (Besides, getting to Federal District judge level means you’ve been a State Judge first, then nominated, then presented to the Senate. It’s not the sort of thing you amble into.)Now, a Federal District judge is a FINE thing for a law firm to get as “Of Counsel” (Which means you’re not a named partner) once they step down. Because having a former Judge, a former Governor, or a former Senator or Representative (with law license, natch) adds the right touch of gravitas to the firm.A quick Google tells me there are 94 Federal Judicial Districts in the US (89 in the US proper. Alsothere are district courts in Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.)The best youMIGHTbe able to hope for is rotating these “Headless Nails”. Oklahoma has two Federal Districts, why not send the HonorableJudge Boasberg down there for a nice five year stint.Were I given the chance, make EVERY damned judge stand for retention / re-election. You wanna make law? Well, legislators make law and have to hustle for re-election. Maybe having these judges “on the hustings” will keep them away from their goofy decisions. Alas, that is not happening any time soon.

        Anyone hoping to somehowreform an irredeemably broken system – by working within the system and placing his hope in men – is doomed to disappointment.  Meanwhile, the forces of the evil, spiteful, mutants are paid and organized, and they are in no way vanquished.  Link via Bayou renaissance man – an army of bioleninists.  No way to deal with these creatures other than permanent removal.  Best of luck.

            “Anyone hoping to somehow reform an irredeemably broken system – by working within the system and placing his hope in men – is doomed to disappointment.”
Definitely true in the public sector. The problem is the lack of effective feedback.
Remove Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, “Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes…” and the system immediately becomes responsive to the States, at the very least.

        I enjoy this blog, check in daily and have for years. Still think it should not get half, or less of the comments that the Kuntsler competitor does – that latter shallower takes than here — in my opinion. Also noting many of those comments are tripe and topic drift — MUCH less so here.My take on this realm is to seek actionable information, to craft strategies that help me and mine. Some of my own takes include, understanding that local prosecutors and judges are nothing more than local LAWYERS. Often with two bit practices — since white hat guys don’t need the ca$h nor have the time to sit on the bench for traffic court.Normies lack initiative and balls. AKA their problem. Have you hired the local judge’s law firm, and him specifically to write up your will, close real estate purchase, or other trivial matter that a monkey could do?Have you researched out the contact information for the local prosecutor, and contacted him EX PARTE at his desk, to ‘help a kid’ … coming off all noble in the process? Discovering his alma mater, other information to break the ice?Understanding the chink in the armor of almost all persons in the public realm is an allergy to WORK … have you parsed the maximum cost of failure — say a ticket already ‘busted down’ by the cop on the roadside … to some trivial penalty … represents the IDEAL opportunity to paper the shit out of the court, Motion to Dismiss, requests for trial, Discovery … postponements?See, I have done ALL of these things and anyone can — just understand to get at the courts Pro Se, you just can’t represent a corporation nor ‘practice law’.If more motivated persons took on Mammon, just think of the results. Forget ‘taking to the woods’ as a partisan — you become a defender of you and yours. You can learn the laws of your state with a little work — let the law schools crank out the middling IQ adversaries … since that is all they do.

                Very interesting feedback, that. Speaks to something I feel on a day to day basis — being around people that are lacking any grasp, even the most basic, on past history, yet having strong opinions about current events.My mind wants to refer to them as “stupid” but that is hubris. One of my current curiosities is, while out there are reports about the ’80/20′ effect, referring to the 80% sheep … how do the ’20’ become the 20? Or as I suspect the ’10’ or maybe the ‘5’ (or less) when you consider that ‘well educated’ credentialed persons, in and adjacent to academia are still ‘stupid’ in terms of being inflicted with TDS or similar mind virus ailments … taking them out of the ’20’.Then take the ’20’, say, in reference to their open-mindedness or objectivity, how many of THEM can go toe-to-toe with some academia geek? Look at a Victor Davis Hanson, outwardly bright guy. Speaks slowly, with gravitas dripping from his every word. Yet, cannot free himself from the shibboleths, from ‘defeating Fascism in World War 2’ backwards and forwards.So he is OFF the list. I feel it is a tiny list, but without need to suck up to the blog host — I am here for reasons that speak for themselves.Then take someone on ‘our side’ that is still wearing three forms of sportsball gear at the same time and can’t name the century of the American Civil War? We’re able to have a beer with that guyk, better than some others, but still, not going to talk about who the Balkan Wars of 1912-13 were not allowed to spread to a World War, or how Khruschev was a Unkrainian … or…that he was from the Donbas ….or. But I do like beer, and can enjoy the company of regular guys.Somewhat intelligent types like Ace of former Brooklyn now Florida, or the aforementioned Kuntlser … could not refrain from going ‘all kill the Boer, er, Amalek’ after the event referred to as “October 7…” thus dropping their masks forever.Why did God, again, bring fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrah? Can’t say I blame Him.The question is: where are the non leftist intellectuals that can find a spark plug on a lawn mower?

                    My take is not about being ‘smarter’ than men with specific skills, in THEIR trade.
More along the lines that Normies have strong opinions about what they are fed —- in terms of what can call ‘political history’ in real time.
So, ‘I Stand with Ukraine’ types. Like all those that fail in the restaurant business — thought they were ready to run a restaurant because, ‘well I eat at restaurants…’

                        Yep. Whatever “we” choose to replace the status quo with, it has to be preconditioned on the idea that to the extent there is a “public” policy, people with the skills and knowledge get to make the relevant decisions.
For example, everyone and his dog has an opinion of how corporate tax rates affect corporations, and the only one whose opinion does not matter is the guy paying that tax, and who understands how each clause in the code affected his business. How many new lines he did not create, how many more employees he did not hire.

I find this comment intriguing.  Can you elaborate, perhaps in a future posting?  I can see some folks finding this forum intimidating, but not necessarily being deliberately intimidated—if that makes sense.
If you are not a troll of some sort and are on your best game, this forum seems quite welcoming to new commenters.  However, you are commenting in a forum containing some very experienced individuals with varied life experiences—tradesmen to academics.  All seem to have a place and wisdom to share.

                    This place is surprisingly civil. Very little flaming and oneupmanship, and people generally disagree agreeably. I’ve been on sites where the average IQ is easily a standard deviation lower than this one and the posters are much nastier. Perhaps there’s little correlation between intelligence and bellicosity. I know for a fact that academia can be an extremely vicious place.

• While the Dunning-Kruger effect often describes people overestimating their competence, its reverse can apply to highly skilled individuals. They may assume that tasks they find easy are also easy for everyone else, leading them to undervalue their unique efforts or abilities.”
There’s any number of other psychological theories, but we often discuss D-K a lot here.

Been thinking about this a couple hours, and maybe this is why things that I think so trivial, like going into business for yourself, are so daunting.
Everyone knows his boss is a moron, and usually, that’s correct. Why can so few come to the conclusion they can run a business better than a moron? I’ve always attributed it to conditioning, but maybe it’s as simple as undervaluing their talents.

It reminds of being at a regional government meeting recently and the group’s lawyer was relating the tale of a guy who was making himself an extreme pest in the region by getting monetary judgements over very petty bookkeeping issues.  Several men asked in the audience where said pest lived and the lawyer rattled off the town, but it was clear that’s not what they wanted to know, they wanted to know where to drive their poorly marked van to in order to rid ourselves of this pest.

                    A world with less robbery. Murder. Rape. These are all things that, if one had a reasonable cause/effect to point to, could probably get majority support. Heck, even crappy cause/effect like gun control gets huge support.
No nogs? Probably not. Assuming violence is innate, most of them appear to be able to suppress the innate tendency. No convicts? That’s possible. They have a proven record of being unable to suppress their innate tendencies.

        Four comments:1. What constitutes the law is usually the lowest common denominator. That may sound terrible, but it’s reality. It’s codification (or judicial ruling) of the lowest acceptable standard of behavior. Anything over and above that would require practically everybody to do a tour in jail and result in living in a police state.Think about it in terms of gambling, prostitution in Nevada, recreational drugs or alcohol consumption. None of that is considered a high standard of behavior, but people still do it and you can’t throw everybody in jail for it.2. I’ve been calling judges secular priests for many years. I don’t particularly like the secular religion that was imposed on us, but at the same time, if you keep “lowest common denominator” behavior in mind, that’s generally what their rulings are about. I don’t think that’s all bad, but something needs to be done to put a stop to their social engineering. That’s really where they need to stay in their lane.3. Judges have equity powers. They are free to fashion an equitable result when either there isn’t legal guidance or when the existing legal guidance would result in an unfair outcome. That’s nothing new, that goes back to our mother courts in England.4. Finally, judicial power acts as a pressure relief valve on society and it does have some value in doing that. A good example of this can be seen in most, but not all, of their rulings about race. It’s usually something causing some measure of strife that Congress can’t or won’t get around to, so the judges step in to take the heat. In a way, it’s kind of like what Trump is doing now. He’s taking care of a lot of unfinished business nobody before him had the guts to tackle. Don’t discount how valuable this function is as much as we dislike when they step in and fashion legal results that they want.That’s all I’ve got.
