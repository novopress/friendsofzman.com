        I question 120. That’s seven days seventeen hours a day. Which makes for very poor work product in my experience, and I have had that experience. Twelve and seven will get you 84. Twelve and six was the standard for textile workers in the first half of the nineteenth century.
BTW, however the Indians worked, it wasn’t like slaves. Slaves worked at not working hard.

        Heaven forfend that the label of “Inversion” befallthe industry so entrenched in full digitalization of every person 1. In the US (except those under the radar), and 2. The planet.“Marketing research”, for your convenience, might just EXPECT the “intrusions” from outside entities…for the proper transfer of electronic credit units of course.

        120hrs x 1.21/hr (the lowest incidentally) =  $145/wk, or $629/mo which is higher than Mexico’s average and very much above India’s $295/mo.In general Asians work much longer hours than our 40/wk including the developed nations such as Japan &amp; S Korea. In India most occupations work ~12hr/days or 60/wk; however, in the IT sector it is common to double that, esp in Delhi, Mumbai, &amp; Bangalore.Nothing in the article mentioned what the Indian workers thought. Given a chance to be paid the same rate but get free travel &amp; possibly room &amp; board for a chance to visit USA, many, in fact, very many would probably jump at such chance &amp; celebrate the opportunity. But the law is the law regardless of the desires of those affected, so these few get an unexpected windfall of several years pay, but at the expense of no such opportunities for other Indians. Oh how rich snobs like to impose on the very, very poor to snatch the few opportunities the do get.

        Of all the big shots in the board room beyond the CEO, I’d say the General Counsel and the Director of HR *MUST* have known what was going on and had both a professional as well as ethical obligation to blow the whistle on the company.

        The likeliest part of the Constitution to be repealed in the near future is the 13th Amendment, not the 2nd, 5th, or 16th like people think.  I can’t think of a scenario where its repealed outright, but a way will be found to make it dead letter or it will just be ignored.
