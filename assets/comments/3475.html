        I’m thinking the worst thing for MSNBC’s ability to “attract” younger viewers id FOX sending out Jessie Watters to quiz young folks on topical current events, replaying the stunning ignorance they cite that seems to be “in line” with what MSNBC caters to, and correcting their “data”.Of course, that doesn’t say much about the value received from education “system” either.

        Viewers “2 and older”?? You’ve got to be kidding me. The fact there’s a metric for toddlers left in front of the TV while mommy gets another glass of wine says that TV ratings are mostly bullshit.

        In the UK, we have the BBC. We pay for this with what is called “the licence fee” which, oddly, is fixed by parliament. Usually, left-leaning parliaments (that’s just about them all, these days) tend to reward Al-beeb with extra monies, which is raised through the “licence fee” and even having a sniff of a TV in your home warrants you paying it. It is, apparently, the devil’s own job to prove that you don’t tune in ever if you have a device capable of receiving the Beeb’s malodorious output of bias and dumb-downdom.We call it the telly tax and thus we have a range of appalling shows (such as EastEnders, the Beeb’s flagship soap, has a whole community screaming and shouting at each other and if they had  token islamists they would however never discuss going to Syria or bombing a tube station) and of course the news, which has a distinct, sneering bias against anything vaguely right-wing.By the way, you in the Sates will be delighted to know that often the Beeb’s news programs leads with some Obama announcement or other. Aircraft gone down somewhere in the world? Al-Beeb thinks we all want to know what El Presidente thinks about it.The good news is the fact we all have to pay for the telly tax means we get no ads in the output. apart from ads for Al-Beeb’s own publications or shows or what’s on other Beeb output channels. Asian music station? Yes, we have an ad for that. they even have ads for paying the telly tax easily via your bank, one of which features a gay couple clearly not enjoying the other’s taste in old films.Like we care, though folk used to say many years ago — alert for homophobia here — you didn’t have to bend over backwards to get on at the BBC, you had to bend over forwards. Of course, I merely report this and do not endorse such a terrible statement in any shape or form.Oh yes, and mixed race couples too appear often in these ads: Al-beeb loves a white woman and a black man being happy on screen. Not sure they are all that common in large swathes of the British Isles but al-beeb thinks you should look at that.So here we have a sneering, Obama worshipping TV channel which has so much leftward bias it is hilarious. UKIP is not, as you would expect, liked at all. On the other hand, the EU is quite nice apparently though as this is the default position of the supposedly three ‘main’ parties then it is hardly surprising.Incidentally, the Beeb is a founder member of a thing called Eurovision which 60 years ago seemed quite novel. Now it comprises an annual Eurovison song contest that may have once spawned Abba with ‘Waterloo’ but now has transexuals from places like Israel winning. Yes, it is a song contest and year after year Britain enters and gets virtually no votes while Serbia and Azerbaijan and Russia of course Israel (none of which i used to think were in Europe) getting popular acclaim. I understand Britain is begged to stay in because the UK delivers the biggest audience for the show, though we all now it is a stitch up where all the Slav countries vote for each other as do the Scandinavians and so on. They would rather vote for ireland than the UK.The Eurosong contest is the final insult. We have to pay for ‘free’ television, have biased reporting, programs with shouting and best of all, no one likes us.

        When I had a DishTV subscription, I’d occasionally sneak a peek at “Link TV”.They had a parade of crusading journalists presenting stories about voter fraud by Republicans, evildoings of coal and oil companies, climate change(naturally) and panels on torture. They hosted fawning interviews with Chomsky, Zinn and the like. Sensitive actor types would narrate their specials.They were very self congratulatory about being independent, non corporate reporters able to tell the “truth”. These statements prefaced donation requests. My take was they sounded a little defensive. In the nooks and crannies of their minds, they knew they were too loopy for mainstream journalism.They make MSNBC’s hosts look like Vulcans

        It’s so true, Leftist ideas and programs seem to always be subsidized one way or another. And you always get more of what you subsidize, hence the Leftist infection spreading its vileness everywhere.
Memo to Phil Griffin: most of the “younger viewers” don’t watch much tv, period, never mind Ministry of Truth Department MSNBC.
