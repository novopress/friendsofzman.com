        Curious, is CAPTDMO a bot…?
The comments always have English words but nothing ever arranged in what might be considered coherent thought, much less a train.

        So, once again, the normal people in WA state go forth to do battle with the nitwits in Puget Sound. This state gets more like California every day.

        Yes, thank you, this is the most common political misunderstanding I know of. The rich are not the ruling elites, and do not affect government but to a small fraction of the level to which the government gorilla controls them. Our rulers became the academia-media-government complex in 1933, a fact which Hayek had already noted in 1940. They respect wealth and hate capitalism, a curious dichotomy, because they think government is the source of wealth. And even when that that mule is ridden until it dies, they will inherit still more power. So they believe, and it may be so. Or not.Garet Garrett–“Outside of the Communist Party and its aura of radical intellectuals few Americans seemed to know that revolution had become a department of knowledge, with a philosophy and doctorate of its own, a language, a great body of experimental data, schools of method, textbooks, and manuals.There was a prodigious literature of revolutionary thought concealed only by the respectability of its dress.To the revolutionary…it was knowledge that gave him a sense of power. One who mastered the subject to the point of excellence could be fairly sure of a livelihood by teaching and writing…and meanwhile dream of passing at a single leap from this mean obscurity to the prestige of one who assists in the manipulation of great happenings.The revolutionary mind that did at length evolve was one of really superior intelligence, clothed with academic dignity…and at ease in all circumstances.What it represented was a quantity of bitter intellectual radicalism infiltrated from the top downward as a doctorhood of professors, writers, critics, analysts, advisers, administrators, directors of research, and so on–a prepared revolutionary intelligence in spectacles.”One of the Austrians pointed out that the capitalist himself was no less likely to be a socialist than anyone else, and likely more so, because capitalism to a capitalist is not theory but rather a talent, leaving him incapable of defending what he does on principle and vulnerable to the projected guilt of others.

        In olden thymes, as you put it, politicians were the lapdogs of the rich.  There was no real regulatory state, and most of the power was in the hands of the plutocrats.  When politicians went after plutocrats, it was usually at the behest of another plutocrat.  Now most corporations are just oversized rent seekers, dependent on government largess and contracts.  They are fearful of the IRS, the SEC, the EPA, and the rest of the massive regulatory bureaucracy.  Corporate CEO’s are no longer Randian owners and inventors; they are risk-averse corporatists who are happy to do as they are told by their masters in Washington, as long as that keeps the stock price up.I’ve often wondered why people like Buffet and Gates just wake up one day and decide that the best use of their hard earned dough is to fund programs that encourage Third World abortions, confiscate guns, open the borders to millions of moronic peasants, and make the nation’s school children stupider.  You think they’d know better.  In the old days these guys built libraries and museums and founded great universities.  They amassed extraordinary art collections and built amazing houses.  Now they pay for Adhiambo Achieng’s late-term abortion, and are proud of it.I think these guys get phone calls.  I think they are told what to do with their cash, or face some kind of SEC investigation or anti-trust suit.  Perhaps the EPA threatens to swoop in and invent some endangered animal that shuts down your factory.  They are told what to do, or face the consequences.

        As a result, there’s a degree of contempt for the rich, in general, amongst the ruling class.

            hmm but aren’t the majority of members of the ruling class rich?Rich compared to Americans, sure. They are not rich by robber baron standards. The typical Silicon Valley rich guy has house boys worth more than the typical hack. Lois Lerner, for example, was making six figures to harass the Tea Party for the Obama administration. That’s servant’s wages in Stamford CT.There are some truly rich congressman and senators, but that’s just the part of the iceberg you see. The real power in Washington is with the permanent bureaucracy and consultancy. They write and administer the laws. The pols give speeches.
