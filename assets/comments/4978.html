        […] It’s tempting to think of this new elite as just an Apple version of the old elites, but that’s a mistake. Consider the media. In the industrial age, news reporters and columnists were jobs filled by men of the working classes who had high literacy. They lived in the same neighborhoods as their readers. Their kids played with the plumber’s kids. Many served in the same roles in the military as their readers. Today, the typical media person is a graduate of an elite school and only knows the sons of toil as servants. Here….  […]

        Just spent the weekend selling some art of mine at an art fair in Glencoe Illinois. Glencoe is a wealthy suburb on the north shore of the Chicago area.The crowd there was a concentrated form of the Cult of Modern Liberalism; the older women trying to look young, the younger women dressed like whores. The culture and politics pure uncut low information. A bubble-land.I could feel the emptiness all around me.However, the men present did not seem to really be a part of it. They were there mostly because their women wanted to be there. I was there to make a buck.I think this alienation you describe is mostly about the women. In fact, I’d wager that the CML is overwhelmingly female, with a small percentage of rather weak men who will back down quickly in a fight.

        Another lens to view the problem through:The indentured servants in H1B purgatory are almost all from socialist or authoritarian backgrounds.  Upon ascending to green card heaven, they do not suddenly begin spouting Locke, Smith, and Jefferson.  Their mindset remains collectivist and authoritarian.  I have some first-hand experience with this.I agree with your assessment of the members of our upper meritocracy.  They really have no understanding of how the 99% live.  They are ahistorical and see themselves as supra-cultural.The H1Bs are like the Greek slaves that the Roman elites brought in to run their estates and government departments.  One or two of them might have been from a “democratic” city state, but the vast majority lived under one oligarchy or another.  They had little sense of the level of trust and transparency that Republican Rome needed to run itself and helped turn Rome into a low-trust state… not that the Romans weren’t in the vanguard of that trend, the importation of highly educated slaves was both a reflection of choices they had already made as well as an accelerant to change.So you could have both a Huxleyan overclass and a foreign-born authoritarian overseer class armed with Orwellian technological tools maintaining order over the rest of us.  The control doesn’t have to be too painful.  Just send the moody Alpha-pluses to the Falklands to brood far away from the rest of the Alphas and Betas and their soma-fueled parties.Of course Burnham would doubtless argue that all I’ve done is make his purely meritocratic administrative and overseer class into an alien meritocratic class.  I plead guilty, but great empires like the Roman, Abbasid, and Ottoman usually work that way.
