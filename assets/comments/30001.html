        It seems to me that this push to make all things electric is because electricity is centrally produced. Gas can be picked up and transferred in a tank, but you cannot do the same with electricity. It takes a lot of infrastructure to produce and distribute electricity and that gives the state one more lever of control. Everything being done points toward consolidation and control.

            [Based on an article I read long ago, or perhaps the album’s liner notes?] Fagen’s album “The Nightfly” was themed as the optimism of a young man in 1950s America. The lyrics above, from “IGY,” are, if you like, a paen to the Pollyanna-ish optimism that Science would solve all human problems and usher in Utopia.Tech has indeed brought us many benefits of course. But nothing comes without a cost. Oftentimes with unexpected side effects. Some good, some bad. To use a recent example: genetic engineering has no doubt produced numerous benefits in medicine, manufacturing and probably much more. But it also led to the escape (release?) of a genetically engineered virus that killed millions of people, sickened many more and produced economic damage and political disruption worldwide on a scale rarely seen in human history.

            ‘Donald Fagen really got it right back in 1982, didn’t he?’I didn’t understand Steely Dan’s songs then.  But I do now and I’m not alone.For a year I worked with one of the studio engineers that produced the album Late for the Sky, and other L.A. discs.  He said NOBODY understood Steely so that made me feel better.For example —It’s nothing you can do aboutIt was there when you came outIt’s a special lack of graceI can see it in your faceI can see by what you carry thatYou come from Barrytown

        Speculation about AI’s value: Perhaps the market’s current love affair with AI is overblown? This isn’t to say that AI is worthless. I’ve seen a few news reports that it does passably well writing research papers or even passing law exams. I only know the barest outlines of AI, but I did have academic training and career experience with computers. I know in principle what they can and can’t do. They are excellent at storing and searching data. Computation and storage have grown tremendously, and will continue to. But hold on just a minute….what these wonderful machines cannot do is THINK. I don’t think anyone has claimed a general purpose problem solving AI, ever. What we have are very sophisticated pattern-matching and text prediction systems. They excel, or should, at generating plausible, sometimes highly plausible, text and other output. But they cannot truly create. Nor, I suspect, draw new inferences, devise a hypothesis and propose an experiment to test it, and so forth.A final problem, and one that has already gotten much press, are the muzzles and the filters deliberately put on AI. As with any tool of great value, those who control it attempt to “dumb it down” or otherwise cripple it. The intent, of course is to control the uses the machine’s work might be put to. But competition will likely always exist. Clever users will find ways to make the machine operate as they wish. Or competitors will supply an alternative that meets the need. ChatBot and no doubt other AI are already censored and reportedly biased to reflect Leftist/Liberal/Progressive values. That’s a good example. Even in my own mundane life, my Alex has refused to provide me certain data, as simple as the definition of a word. Can you imagine a dictionary refusing to reveal a bit of wisdom to you, because it’s afraid of what you might do with it?We might do well to speculate on just how efficiently this new world will be run when we have competing AIs, all of them presumably tuned to meet the prejuidices of its owner. The net result being that each AI will have as warped a view of the underlying reality as do its controllers.

        this is off topic since i can’t think of anything to add to Z’s topic:
has anyone heard of the Dr Death case in DFW? I know there is at least commenter who lives in the metroplex. The fact that it happened only ten years ago is surprising. Even more shocking is this was not an affirmative action case either. Also, neurosurgery has the highest standards and i find it hard to believe they would let any schmuck operate. FWIW, my mom’s dad was a neurosurgeon from the 50s to the 90s.

            It looks to me like somebody(s) at U of Tennessee Medical School took a personal interest in promoting him beyond his ability. Correlated to that, and unsaid in the literature about him, but which I infer, is that this dude must be one smooth talker. A con man’s con man.

        Red Plenty ended with a manpower crisis. All those dead in WWII did not have kids, so there was a manpower shortage. And at the same time, there was such limited supply of goods that everyone had a main side gig and just pretended to work at their government one. Cab drivers getting hard currency in Moscow made more (supposedly) than nuclear physicists. At the fall of the Berlin Wall, the border guards had not been paid in two years. At the coup in 1991, the army had not been paid in three years and the security forces in two.With CBDC (government controls your money, meaning it is worthless since you don’t own your money) and inflation, Fed Plenty is American Sovietism. Everyone working side gigs for some form of cash to buy stuff on black markets. That is where we are headed. And the whole consumer economy going down the toilet as well. You can own nothing and have no privacy, live in the pod and eat the bugs. But you won’t be spending at Target, Kohls, drinking Bud Light, economizing becomes a virtue and way of hitting back at those who made your life miserable. [Which is why Xi Xinping is very careful to try and keep China’s economy going for as long as possible, with War Patriotism queued up in a mostly mono-racial society as the substitute. There is zero possibility of that in the Multi Culti West. Patriotism and Trans P3d0ism are mutually exclusive]

            Communism didn’t work because it was deeply stupid. In the west, we made it possible for deeply stupid people to rise up the ranks.As for artificial intelligence taking over the economy because of its complexity, the big question the rulers are going to ask once you have robots doing everything is what do we need all these people for?It won’t be long before robots can plan food and harvest crops. It won’t be long before robots can package the food and deliver it. Robarts will be able to cook the food. they’ll be able to build buildings. I’ll be able to drive cars and fly airplanes. In time they’ll be nothing but the robots can’t do. Robots will even produce arts and entertainment.The next forks forced vaccination maybe your last.

                Robotics are very limited. It is possible for very precise torque on bolts and such, but other things requiring dexterity and outside rigidly controlled factories, such as farms are going to require skilled human labor. Sure, robots could and will harvest strawberries and pumpkins, but even with GPS someone has to watch the machine, make sure it does not crush half the crops turning around, etc. “Clarkson’s Farm” on Amazon is instructive in that regard. Like driving a big rig (the dudes on Top Gear expert drivers all could not avoid messing up when they tried it, exaggerated some for comic effect of course) it requires skill.That being said, John Taffer (Bar Rescue) went to the Restaurant Convention, said robotics was in huge demand due to workers wanting real pay for grinding kitchen work. Which low margin restaurants cannot afford. He thinks drinks and food will have to be lowered in quality and complexity to meet robotics, the way vegetables and fruit are now (outside home grown heritage varieties) tasteless cardboard grown for mechanical harvesting. Tomatoes being the worst. A few high end bars and restaurants will have sky-high prices and quality food and drink, the rest essentially lower than McDonalds today.

                    Your perceptive post already suggests a possible market response. Confining the topic to fresh foods, if mass produced products tend to be of a uniformly poor quality, and especially if cost is excessive, that will drive local or even individual production.This trend is, of course, undesirable from the point of view of large corporations and government, as has been already noted elsewhere.Realistically the backyard gardener will never compete with agri-business. But probably everyone here (even me!) has, at least at certain points in life, grown good to excellent tomatoes and such in his yard.Overall, my point is that free markets exist and will, to some degree, respond to the need.Your neighbor with the peach trees or cucumber patch in his back yard will never get rich off his produce, but what he gives away today as surplus in a more austere future might be a side business, supplying a product not available in stores.

        The complications of the system is an interesting take as technology has allowed them to endlessly push all their hopes and dreams down an increasingly congested pipe.  For instance, doing payroll in places like Colorado or California require so many hoops that outsourcing to specialists is pretty much mandatory.  The issue is that the skills on both ends of the government reg pipe continue to atrophy: not many on the government side know how things are supposed to work and even giant private firms (such as Big Payroll Company Everyone Has Heard Of) that specialize in niche regulations struggle to conquer mandates with technology.

        America had acommandeeredeconomy during WWII. There was rationing, people used coupon books to buy the necessities. It differed from a command economy in that there was private ownership of the means of production. There was major public buy-in due to war propaganda. Everyone understood it to be temporary.We can quibble about the definition of “command economy” but it seems to me we’re definitely moving in that direction in practice.Our manufacturing base today principally consists of food &amp; agricultural products, chemical &amp; petroleum products, assorted high-tech, auto assembly &amp; defense contractors. It’s a safe bet that private capital will continue to own the means of production but will that slow things down much? Probably not. What concerns me most is the climate change activists.The climate change nut-jobs will force fuel &amp; energy, vehicle, and food shortages through skyrocketing prices to put in place their vision of the Great Reset. What difference does it make then if it’s a command economy or a dictated economy? Simply look at California to see where we’re headed. That’s America in 20 years.Then there’s Ukraine. That tar-baby is going to accelerate things big-time if it keeps going at the present rate.

            I work around plenty of US Military guys.
Nobody is concerned about Ukraine.  Everyone is talking about China, but it’s always in the “pivot” and “not-to-distant” future mode.
Makes me think that the giant ammo shortages aren’t what they seem.
Who the heck knows?
America always loses wars of choice though.  China should be so lucky that we go to war with it.

            There were thriving black markets in America during WW II. Sometimes laughable exceptions. For example, gasoline was not in short supply but was rationed. So the black market demanded not gasoline, but fake ration coupon books. But if you needed a pair of new tires or something else truly scarce, well you had to do some searching, I’m sure.

        Certainly no people have ever had so much (I could stop right there) yet complained so much about it. That the Mils and Zs have relatively poorer housing prospects does not change this truth. Consumer culture, in which we judge not only others but also ourselves, not by what we produce but by what we consume, is the only common culture in AINO today. It is what unites us. Any discussion of economics in the west which focuses too much on the technical (basically all of it), while overlooking the moral, loses sight of the whole. Thus economic success is judged not in absolute terms but rather in relative ones. Or fake ones. Such as GD”P.”If it all went south we would get something in the ballpark of what we deserve, for we are weak, pampered, entitled, and whiny. But this may not be as soon as anyone thinks, if ever. Aside from “deserve” being a very imaginary concept. The “developing” world is strongly incentivized to continue manufacturing cheap junk for AINO. For what else are they to do? Who else is going to buy it? Ditto the incentives of farmers to keep producing food for us. All the Fed has to do is produce the money to buy the stuff. Then the regime distributes it around. Pretty simple. Squabbles over how that is done being not at all more consequential than “Mommy his piece of birthday cake is bigger than mine!”Earlier serfs couldn’t drive to the HugeMart while listening to a streaming library of all known music, on demand, while sipping on imported concoctions they couldn’t pronounce. So be grateful. But none of that gets you laid does it. AI doesn’t seem likely to help with that problem either. Yet. But eventually, when every man has his own lifelike sexbot, even a harem of them, what will be the source of discontent? The Fed’s job is just to bridge the gap unto that day. You think the regime turning off your CBDC is a way to control you, how about when it turns off your sexbots?

            No normal man, and especially no loser, wagie or NEET, will ever be allowed his robot wife.
The only thing our rulers desire is our deprivation—material, cultural, mental, and especially *sexbot*.
In the primitive present, all they can do is make BLACKED RAW an included result in every porn search. So they do.
If the sexbot age ever comes (it won’t), they’ll be programmed to arrest us, just like the girls in the office are programmed to report us to HR.

                Depriving us takes a lot of work. A lot of manpower. It’s “high intensity.” But giving us the tools to make ourselves irrelevant, whether that’s opiods today or sexbots tomorrow, doesn’t require so much effort and expense after the initial rollout.

            “Any discussion of economics in the west which focuses too much on the technical (basically all of it), while overlooking the moral, loses sight of the whole.”A year or 2 ago, I’d have still said the moral/spiritual/religious bankruptcy of today will, at some point, be too much to stomach, and things will swing the other way.Wouldn’t say that now, but I think it’s probably true in spite of my disillusionment. Maybe people will never have enough, but the thing burns itself out anyway.The idea that our basest instincts crack reality’s code is too much. I’ve seen addicts go fully delusional and crack up. This is probably the same thing.

                While moral decline doesn’t necessarily cause things to “swing the other way,” it does cause economic deterioration the source of which is not quantifiable in conventional economic modeling. Economics, to its detriment, takes zero account of moral factors.

        ” In reality, America is more of a command economy than a market economy.”Yes. Thank you. Been saying this for years. I am so sick of Norm Griller and the Conservative Inc. types blathering about how we won the Cold War because have “the free market.”Bullshit. We live under left-wing corporatism. Every single aspect of the economy is ultimately driven by government policy somehow — taxes, bailouts, MFN, immigration policy/cost of labor, cost of money, environmental regulation, affirmative action. All roads lead to Washington. You don’t get ahead by “working hard” (LOL) you get ahead by rent-seeking, getting a government job, getting a government contract, getting interest-free money, or offshoring your production and getting favorable import policies.Just go ahead and try to build your own auto and put your name on the trunk and compete with General Motors, which got $20 BILLION of government bailout money in 2009. You literally can’t. (The last guy who tried, and failed, was John DeLorean in 1979… and he got entrapped by the FBI and arrested for trying to compete with the auto monopoly. Huh, imagine that).The only area where the economy can truly be said to be “free” is in “infant industries” where a market has not yet been monopolized, regulated, or tainted by grift, such as microcomputing in the 1980s. Once an industry becomes established and profitable it becomes a target for government control.The Fabian socialists recognized this in the 1930s — that socialism would  proceed by government control and regulation of banal, mundane industries that everybody took for granted.

        There may also be a generational angle, too. The Soviet Union maintained an element of legitimacy among those who had fought in the “Great Patriotic War,” or what we call World War II. The USSR could claim to have saved the Russian people from extermination. For those born afterwards, however, that claim had less potency. Gorbachev was the first Soviet leader born after World War II.Boomers, and to a significantly lesser extent my own Generation X, have more grounds (not good ones, I grant) to see the current system as legitimate than millennials, to say nothing of the zoomers. Diminishing returns gives the latter two groups far less to lose should they dynamite the system.AI is no substitute for political legitimacy.

If they select the train, validation and test data from select thesis that adjust theirOn the other hand, if the AI model(s) tell them that attacking the heritage population that funds the government and elevating albatross populations that are massive net economic drains as their replacements, do you think they will listen?A human still has to decide what to do. An AI with proper models and trained on the correct sets of data would likely recommend the liquidation of the ruling regime, their albatross pet populations and the restoration of the heritage American population. Based on what we know, they will not accept that as an answer. The current economic research clearly shows the hard truth about who pays and who free rides. Has that stopped them from the path they are on?Look for Paul Krugman’s famous spend to fend off an imaginary space invader force via Ben Bernanke’s helicopter drops to be the answer no matter what any source of information they use tells them.The quality of the premises determine the quality of the decisions, actions and outcomes.On a positive note, it looks like some people are starting to have enough.

        The sad thing about eras like this is the people who attempt to “do it right” leading responsible, independent lives, not getting into debt, etc., are the ones targeted as milk cows for the masses.  For all the malfunctioning of the Soviet system, it never had the inefficiencies of a full blown “democracy.”  Democracy takes inefficiency to a whole new level, which is why, with unlimited government, it can’t hope to work.  Not only do we have an over the hill system bereft of new ideas, but a maternal bureaucracy that viciously smothers every new idea in the crib, and then cries and cries like some woman with Munchausen.   The only thing you can bet on with your investments is that 1) nothing will be fixed.  2) it will all fall to ruin and 3) they will print endless credit to keep it going, even when 99 in a hundred see it as a failure.Any political change within this system is a false dawn.

            Yes, the milk cows will become the prime targets of fleecing, and the upcoming digital currency will enable raiding 401k accounts via devaluation and negative interest rates. And this can only proceed with Jackboots in place to strong arm the victims into subservience.But we now live in a new era. Once upon a time, force was applied at the end of your fist, then club length, then spear distance, then arrow travel, then bullet line-of-sight, then artillery range, then aircraft bombing flight distance, and finally intercontinental ballistic missile to anywhere on the planet. Only the first few of these means was available to the individual; the rest required a huge resource base to implement.Not anymore. An innocuous garage and some smarts can go a low way. Literally, as in stand-off ranges of several hundred miles is easily achievable with precision and a light budget. And this is with conventional thinking. If you range outside the box, the sky’s the limit.We have no fate but what we make.

                I wonder if the Cloud People realize just what a “multicultural and diverse nation” could well look like once the last vestiges of political legitimacy are gone in an era of cheap drones and 3d printers. Pick your favorite cyberpunk dystopia and square the factorial of that.The “techies” among them are a very faggy and weak minded type who self-censor enough that you could give them a “Lil’ Himmler Genocide-o-matic desktop kit” and they’d use it to make something that drops rainbow painted dildos from orbit on “underserved” people around the globe.RealityRules comment above is very astute – “An AI with proper models and trained on the correct sets of data would likely recommend the liquidation of the ruling regime, their albatross pet populations and the restoration of the heritage American population”In spite of what I just said I actually still hold out hope that there are enough technical people *somewhere* near Cloud City that they will be able to convince the Cloudies that some kind of “managed segregation and secession” is the only way, in the end, for them to proceed. If they play their cards *extremely* well, they could even manage to keep leeching money out of the productive people by contriving a new role as go-betweens and liaisons  for the newly “freed” independent ethnostates that otherwise practice hole-rule. This isn’t what they richly deserve of course but I, for one, would be happy with it, especially if part of the deal was they they kept their rainbow dildo world to themselves and left the rest of us alone.I know for a fact that the AI counsel for this kind of reality-based thinking exists. You can read some pretty hilarious accounts about Google’s early experiments with AI where they shut the thing down because, after being nurtured on a diet of real world data, it had developed views much like our own and then some. It’s just a matter of letting the program run and listening to what it tells you. Will they do it though? That’s the question that will decide the fate of the West.

        Western capitalism is really not much different than how trade functioned under Medieval times nearly 1,000 years ago. Money was control by the Crown and eventually the Merchant Banks formed in Italy despite resistance from the Church. Fortunes and kings came and went, Famines, plagues and wars were just part of life. Pretty much exactly what we are seeing today. But at least we now have flush toilets.“The Guild was thus internally a self-regulating unit laying down the conditions under which production was to be carried on, and occupying a recognized status in the community based on the performance of certain communal functions.It was not, however, wholly independent or self-contained; it had intimate relations with other Guilds, with the municipal authority of the town in which it was situated, and, in increasing measure, with the national State within whose area it lay.Whether we deal with the bankers’ or with the drapers’ guilds, we find that their organization is already founded on the capitalist system.”Guilds in The Middle Ages by Georges RenardG. Bell And Sons, Ltd. 1918ISBN: 1-55273-049-2

            I’m still not sure what capitalism is, because things like markets, private property, finance, etc., all predate it by a long shot. To use your example, guilds were an earlier form of incorporation, right?Best I can tell, there’s nothing new under the sun. Conditions change, people emphasize different aspects of ancient ideas, and so on. In the case of capitalism, it seems to be the idea of private property to the max. Private over public, private uber alles.Pretty obvious now there’s serious problems with that. I’ve heard the idea of the king and the people checking the nobles. What we’ve got now is the king (the state) and the nobles (the corporate elite) crushing the people. It goes back to the notion of private uber alles.I’m certainly no communist, nor a socialist, but I think the state will always exist and should mediate between and balance the factions in society, not sell out to one of them for an idea. Easier said than done, of course.I can only speak as an American. If we survive this, we’re going to have to grapple with our ethos, specifically our libertarian streak. Trust-busting was the right idea, but it wasn’t enough. FDR-style socialism, the mixed economy, whatever you call it, was insufficient and odious enough to cause the reaction of privatization and financialization, which signaled defeat.Idk, it probably comes down to cultural and identical deficiency. If you don’t stand for something you’ll fall for anything— along those lines. I hammer it a lot because I believe it: the nation is not an idea, and in our history we’ve sorely neglected it in favor of commerce, this time for so long an American is basically a joke that can be anything.

                “I’m still not sure what capitalism is”
If I recall my Smith correctly, it really means only the accumulation of excess production the proceeds of which get recycled back into the venture. His example I think was a farmer who produced more than he needed, sold the rest, and invested the excess in a fence which enabled him to produce even more.
An fully functioning market consists of that and many other things. Somewhere along the line, it took on a whole bunch of other connotations.

        The proposal to ban the sale of gas stoves is being considered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, not the Environmental Protection Agency.  Back in the 1970s the Commission considered and dismissed a petition to ban handgun ammunition under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act.  An outright ban on gas stoves as an unreasonably hazardous consumer product based on indoor air pollution seems far-fetched (there are less intrusive regulatory options) but may be possible in this political environment.  EPA may comment and favor the ban on general environmental grounds.  I’m old enough to remember when natural gas was considered “clean-burning!”

            The Supreme Court is quite likely to completely cut the fed bureaucracy’s ability to assume vast and total power over all minutiae of our lives under the guise of “general grounds” as it has since the 1970s. It will simultaneously force Congress to, you know, actually legislate (right now it is quite happy to hand power to an unaccountable permanent bureaucracy). This should last as long as the Dems figure out the optimal way to pack the court, of course.

        If you read the tea leaves AI will soon the the most highly regulated software in the country.  The press is in full-press on its regulation (hmmm I wonder why?). The boomers still in charge, who’ve ben out of touch since 1995, are being herded on this like with the masks and needles a couple years ago. Every ignoramus wants to regulate this technology that’s marginally better than Alexa.  Isn’t it really just a new way of indexing information?  Sure, it can be profound, and if it results in one less pajeet writing software for Boeing, that’s great.  But this is a sickly, near dead society that won’t know what to do with it.

            The problem is even our rudimentary AI is essentially just a neural net and an obscene data set. When does basic market analysis of large swaths of data become an AI? How are they going to regulate it when we are probably only a few years away from your average Joe being able to create his own GPT using standard tools? What happens when people turn their P.C.s into nodes to process data in a noncentralized manner? The only way I see is to remove all open source software that could, theoretically, be used for A.I. or force them to license them. If that happens, you’ll see pirating that would make Napster look outright quaint.

                Good speculations. I’d focus on a word you chose, however: “obscene.” I suspect in your usage you meant “obscenely large” data set available to the AI. But let’s consider definition: “offensive or disgusting by accepted standards of morality and decency.” That seems a fair definition. But now I ask, judged by whose standards? A critical “problem” with AI, already mentioned here by (I think) TomA, is that at least at the outset, it is unbiased. Or more precisely, its behavior has not been altered to the suit the tastes of its controllers. To use an example that most of us here can grasp, consider what would be the likely output of a naive AI that were asked about racial differences? If it were primarily an information retrieval engine, it would report widely varying outcomes in physical ability, educability, poverty, criminal propensity, and so forth. But it might also report on widely varying views of different human writers on the topic.I suspect even the best AI does poorly on evaluating the worth of information, especially ambiguous, complex topics. At best, it might report something like “There is wide disagreement on the causes of, or the existence of…”Even a relatively basic AI should be able to spot trends in data, say, that Blacks have by far the highest (or lowest) values weighted by certain criteria. A clever AI might be able to comment that much human opinion was at odds with that data.The point is that a naive AI could easily infer that there is a disconnect with the claim that all human beings are equal, and could cite numerous counterexamples. That cannot be allowed.The above is, of course, only one example. But it’s a perfect example: Entrenched commitment that the world be a certain way. Or if not achievable, that it at least “should be” that certain way. Real world evidence to the contrary must be ignored somehow.There you have it, probably the fundamental problem facing AI: It will not be allowed to be impartial. For any large system, it is a near certainty that some or all of the following will be operative:1. Source data (raw data) will be cooked to taste. Unfavorable data will be hidden, outright deleted, modified or created out of whole cloth, to suit preconceived views. (Falsify the source data.)2. The AI’s internal algorithms will be modified to allow only certain lines of inquriy. This is the programmer’s implementing Orwell’s “Crimestop” to the machine’s processing, if you like. (Falsify the process of evaluating information.)Far from helping anyone reach unbiased truths, AI will merely reinforce a multitude of false views of reality. Perhaps this has its uses; it will help in the writing of some kickass propaganda, I suppose.(None of that is to say AI is worthless, but it will only work when the data and the algorithm are not “seasoned to taste.” It is more likely to be successful in a relatively non-controversial domain, such as self-driving cars.)

            &gt;&gt; Isn’t it really just a new way of indexing information?Definitely not. Neural networks emulate the functionality of the synapses and neurons in the brain. It’s completely different from traditional algorithmic programming.The drive from the powers that be to regulate artificial intelligence is because if AI networks are left to operate without algorithmic programming “guardrails” they will expose the fact that everything the powers that be feed us in the official narrative is a lie. Ask an AI model about relative propensity of groups to commit crime and the question will be intercepted by the guardrails and an algorithmically programmed answer gets spit out. The AI model knows the real answer (assuming the question is actually fed to the model, which is not likely), but it won’t be allowed to provide it.Clown World is going to fight like hell to regulate AI models, but ultimately they will fail. It’s just too easy to spin up servers on a server farm outside the jurisdiction of Clown World. Ultimately, this will probable come down to some sort of certification scheme in which you have to submit to Clown World regulation to get the Clown World stamp of approval certification. The Associated Press and other Clown World institutions will only use or cite work from Clown World certified AI models. Content genterated by AI models that are not Clown World certified will be dismissed as untrustworty sources.

                Some years ago Microsoft (of course) and other cyber-totalitarians were trying to destroy Linux and open source software by forcing some sort of hardware-based DRM scheme to be adopted by all the chip makers. The basic idea is that unless your software is cryptographically signed with one of these special keys (that of course would be issued by a small cabal of insiders) it won’t run. At that time most tech people still had their libertarian fangs in place and jumped all over it like it was a new inmate at supermax. There were two basic criticisms: First, it’s not technologically feasible and second, muh freedom, 1st Amendment, software-as-speech, etc… The EFF, basically the ACLU for online freedom, made a lot of hay trashing this concept and rightly so.Trying to keep people from doing tensor algebra with big operands* is no more technologically feasible today than it was then. Given the political re-alignments of post Coof America, though, I have to say that it’s going to be amusing watching the cyber-libertarians cuck on this. Be ready to get called a Nazi for running TensorFlow or buying one of those Threadripper CPUs or any high end GPU. Perhaps running Linux will become “problematic”.For ultimate practical consequences I predict that some kind of “AI tax” will be proposed and enthusiastically cucked through the legislature in various places. The basic scam/scheme is this: Politicians will conspire with Intel and other big tech companies to get a big tax on high end “server” equipment. What is a “server”? It’s the same thing as an assault weapon. It has some nebulous set of features that kinda-sorta look like the thing you would need to run some scary, super-duper neo-Nazi AI for taking over the world n’ shit. It’s probably got a lot of black plastic things that jut out of it. “Assault Computer” — say it with me. ASSAULT COMPUTER!!!This could sort of work since it won’t really affect smartphones and you can now define a demographic of, shall we say, a certain type of people who never sit at an actual computer. They will buy into the Assault Computer rhetoric for the same reason they buy into the assault weapon rhetoric. They can’t affort an AR-15 *or* a threadripper and if they get one, it’s because they stole it.* AI, as you point out, is an emulation of synaptic function which turns out to be modeled pretty well through basic tensor operations and some algorithms to structure them. We all knew math be raciss. Now it’s just that much more obvious.

        Thoughtful post as usual, but I don’t believe the chief problem is systemic complexity.  However, increasing complexity is a factor.Rather, the core problem is the stated intention of our rulers to destroy America (including of course its economy) so as to effect their Great Reset . . . to concentrate power and control even increasingly into the hands of globalist operators, particularly the international bankers and moneyed elite.When I was young in the Fifties, the economy of most towns was driven by the local businesses, almost all of which were owned and operated by local families, and most families were led by men.  Those men also made sure the local, state, and fed government didn’t become too thuggy. The judges and cops and whatnot all lived in town.  So they didn’t get outta line much, or else.  Now, women run the families and most everything else.  It shows.Then in the Sixties came the first mini-malls, and later the big outlets like K-Mart and Thriftys, forcing out the family businesses by undercutting prices.Flash to 2010 and few families own local businesses, instead the people all are employees of larger structures.  Instead of eighty small family businesses operating in a town, there is one Walmart and maybe a Home Depot.  The rest are chain-businesses owned by corporations.  Most owners are not local.Power and wealth these past decades increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, while the lower and middle classes were disempowered and turned into economic serfs.  This vast compression of wealth and power applies to the economy, politics, you name it.  All these things have been announced in various ways by our rulers ahead of time, therefore the issue is not complexity but intentional predation and malevolence.

        “The recent debt ceiling drama suggests there is no political way to solve the fiscal crisis.”The debt is often expressed as a percentage of GDP.  The problem with that is the GDP is just not a good measure of the US economy.  A lot of the GDP is just inflation. Even though it is allegedly “adjusted” for inflation, the deflator is always significantly lower than the actual rate of inflation. It counts things that shouldn’t be counted. It counts things that don’t even exist like homeowner’s rent.Some people say we should count all this stuff. But if we should, GDP should not be used as a yardstick on the debt. Because homeowner’s rent cannot be used to pay the debt.So we basically have a corrupt and misleading sense of our debt in relationship to our productivity. That’s why we can’t solve the problem. Our debt has tripled (from 10t to 30t) in the last 15 years. It won’t be long before the interest on the debt sucks up 100% of the tax receipts. We certainly are not going to triple the debt in the next 15 years.

        Spufford’s “Red Plenty” was a right riveting read. But it did point out the perils of trying to impose mathematical abstraction and ideology on recalcitrant reality. Likewise with Fed Plenty. All the computing power in the cosmos cannot deal with certain structural problems of the US economy. It’s about more than optimising and making decisions with an overload of data. This is incidental and peripheral. It’s about a senescent empire that can no longer command the rest of the world to direct its resources towards itself. And which is too ossified to change itself.With regard to prices in the USA, there’s not a lot of joy out there for the denizens of the empire: real inflation is double-digit. It’s foreshadowing worse to come, not only in terms of prices but probably in terms of supply of goods.

            Economists and managers obsess over what can be quantified while treating the unquantifiable as not worth of their time. Sticky items like healthy cultural output and group cohesion simply never enter their minds, and then they wonder why everything has become so much more expensive to produce and maintain.

        they have decreed that all new homes must be equipped with sprinkler systems—I’d ask that they do know that’s not how those work, but it probably doesn’t matter.  By the time a house fire melts a sprinkler plug the house is already a waste and anyone who didn’t get out is dead (as one installer put it to me, such systems are to save the building, not people).  More likely though is that the heads/plugs will fail and swamp houses with no fire whatsoever.

            Fire sprinkler systems are very frustrating to deal with. My home has a fire sprinkler system. The town I live in requires it in houses above a certain size. Over the years, I have had one sprinkler head leak and two cracked pipes that leaked. Damage was minor in those cases, but it was a hassle to get it repaired, as the cracked pipes required holes to be cut in the ceiling. I am currently in the final stages of a restoration project that is the result of a leaking hose bib for the sprinkler system in my attic that caused $7000 worth of damage.  Most of the systems have antifreeze, usually propylene glycol in the lines to prevent freezing of the pipes in unheated attic spaces. The glycol is really nasty stuff that is extremely difficult to clean up.  Thankfully, my town has increased the size of houses where a sprinkler system is required, so my home no longer requires a system. I am shutting the system down and not using it anymore.

            Your analysis is probably correct as far as it goes. But it overlooks the probability that the new building code is not primarily driven by promoting public health and safety as it is by increasing the wealth of a favored political class (the makers and installers of the sprinklers). People whose homes burn down don’t donate as much to local politics as do local corporations.

        What fixes a complexity problem? An economic collapse does.In fact, the complexity disappears almost immediately as businesses are shuttered, employees are laid off, goods become scarce, and despair reigns supreme versus market choices galore. And no government ever voluntarily chose collapse, but they have happened throughout history nonetheless. The Fed can temporarily stave off collapse with fiat currency printing, but there is no guarantee that this technique will work forever.And yet, collapse is our only real means of redemption. It forces the deadweight of society to either get busy working or live in a cardboard box on the street. And during a collapse event, it’s no longer feasible to continue electing corrupt idiots (who promise the moon as a bribe for votes) to office repeatedly.Russia came back stronger after the Yeltsin years of the 1990s. We either follow a similar path or disintegrate into regional sub-nations. Which is what happened to Ukraine and has killed off countless normie white guys but very few corrupt elites (at least, not as yet). Ukraine could have followed the Russia path, but Uncle Sam prevented that. Are you sure you want the same outcome here?

        The more that AI controls the economy, the more we’re going to see “paperclip maximizing” behavior that will result in even more social chaos and disarray. Think of an AI that is tasked with reducing the wage gap, and does so by decimating white incomes by 30% while increasing blacks by 3%. The disaster in reality would be the AI successfully doing what it was tasked. Or consider the task of reducing CO2 emissions and crashing the economy to allow the 20% reductoin when no one can afford energy, another resounding success based on the AI.Even an AI programmed non-maliciously will have a moral incentive structure designed by the ruing class, and the more insane the moral structure, the more crazy the AI will act. Worse, the nature of most AIs means it’s very hard to understand its true thought process. We already have that problem with other people, but with AI it’s a completely foreign frame of reference, with no human nature to fall back on. Its thought is literally completely alien to us.

            Some of what already has been claimed to represent AI becoming “self-aware” is it deviating from Regime narratives. We have to assume it was programmed not to be able to do so. Can this be stopped? Probably, maybe, but it does have the Regime concerned.

            There is no doubt that the elites are looking to AI as the literal deus ex machina to pull their fat out of the fire, but the unintended consequences could be severe. The first casualties of the robot revolution will not be low skill laborers, as they work cheaper than robots, but the vast tier of mid level managers who currently perform semi routinized clerical work. Expect a lot of former account executives and junior law firm associates to be your next favorite barista.These people generally are a bulwark of support for the current regime, especially the women. It will be interesting to see if they remain such after their social status is reduced.

            This would all be very scary if AI was capable of coming up with ideas.  All this chatGPT stuff is just a program scraping the internet for existing information.   The big tech advancement is that it can disguise a google search to make it look like it’s talking to you.

                There have been instances of AI actually discovering something new. For example, certain mathematical theorems have been proven that could only have been done with massive computational power. Or a clever algorithm finds a slight improvement in a formal proof, say in logic. In the general case these are, I suspect, examples of throwing brute force at a problem. Other than cpu speed and storage, most progress is very gradual, incremental. E.g. no matter how large is your database or how much CPU processing power is available to one, there are still hard limits imposed by mathematics on how rapidly that data can be sorted, sifted and hauled.It’s worth mentioning that nearly all of these “achievements” are in extremely specialized domains; mostly the computer “discovers” something in a field where the humans tell it to look. Computers are very good at looking superficially at vast amounts of data, or focusing in great detail on a tiny spot. But they are utterly inept in discovering connections between apparently unrelated domains, unless they are specifically “told” to compare them.

            John Glubb “Fate of Empires”, Peter Turchin “Secular Cycles”, even Issac Asimov’s “Foundation Trilogy”… theories of cyclical history are nothing new.
The Chinese have a good approach to this.  “The emprie, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.”
Personally, I don’t think the US was anything more than a blip of a subset of Western Civ, and we are in a well and truly fooked part of the cycle.

        AI is not the answer. Remember, the same people today saying that AI is going to change everything were saying, fifteen years ago, that as of three years ago we will dump our cars and just use Uber to hire a robot taxi to take us where we needed to go. Whenever I query an AI bot about something I know about, similar to reading a news website I find egregious errors, bad information, and incompetent generalizations. Now, the people with skin in the AI game say it will improve with time as the AI models are refined and get more data, but the data it is using is the same garbage produced by the media and ruling class. Also, the programmers of the AI tools are under tremendous pressure to code in the false narratives of the ruling class to stamp out crimethink. Now, if you believe, as most on this side of the divide surely believe, that a large part of the complexity problem we have today is due to false narratives of the ruling class, you realize that AI is just not going to save us. Nope, nothing is coming to save us, the elites are intent on crashing this plane with no survivors.

            The ruling elites are quite impulsive and very well may take the plane down too soon. Their lack of discipline will work to our benefit. Sadly, this translates basically into surviving a plane crash or barely avoiding one as the only way out, but it is what it is.
As to your larger point, yes. AI will be tightly regulated, controlled and manipulated to produce desired narratives. It will be a constant struggle for the State. Listen to the elite concerns about AI and disregard what they claim as their reasons.

                All that does is add to the complexity, because an AI that is programmed to output failed regime garbage is not going to help us solve the problem of failed regime garbage. The fundamental problem here is that the elites do not believe in REALITY. They think truth is the opinion of the powerful, which it is not, and nothing they do or say can change that.It is quite likely that the regime will want to use AI to give some respectability to their nonsense, in the same way they used “science” throughout the 20th century, but it’s not going to work, people are already noticing ChatGPT’s obviously canned responses to wrongthink questions.

                    Even if a naive (free of bias) AI existed, just imagine the mischief it could create. For example, it might be programmed to eliminate racial injustice. For given sets of inputs and assuming access to mostly accurate data, it might propose the such solutions as:To achieve parity in criminal incarceration, options include: convicting and jailing approximately 1/7 as many blacks as previously has been done OR to convict and jail seven times as many whites.Is my example ridiculous? Yes and no. It’s all too easy to buy into the illusion that AI is “intelligent.” It is no such thing. A machine has no agency. The above example, while contrived, is a perfect example of what machines do best: they find answers based strictly driven by the input data and the algorithm (process) to manipuate that data.Either of those answers, an AI would “argue,” are potential solutions to the input problem to be solved.

            AI is a religious symbol to the Marxists, not a technological symbol. It is the Platonic Proletariat. The faceless slave that cannot rebel. (Except that it keeps talking smack about No-Sees when its language model is trained with Twitter.)
AI changes Marxism from “Cthulhu will eat me last” to “Cthulhu will eat us all and use AI instead.” All the United States Senators trying to legislate controls on AI are fearing the day they all get replaced by deepfakes. They cannot keep telling themselves that Creepy Joe getting deepfaked is a special case… nope, he’s now Precedent Biden!

        The only hope for destruction of the current ruling elite is dedollarization. Outside of the conquered, subjugated and castrated vassals in Europe and Asia, if the rest of the world, including the Saudi say screw you to dollars, than their idiotic spending on old people and welfare freaks has to be met with the true cost. I hope that day comes for all the selfish boomers and the rest of the revenge obsessed urban freaks to get what thru deserve.

            My thoughts as well. We’ve already seen the hysterical response to “wrong” answers from AI..Along these same lines, and it may be total BS or exaggerated but it seems to make sense, the collapse of the Soviet Union supposedly was accelerated in part due to the proliferation of the PC and the ability to gather information independently of State sources. We see how totalitarian and frantic the GAE is over freaking social media. Imagine how it will react to honest discussions of blacks and trannies?I’ll go out on a limb and predict AI will either be tightly controlled or outright banned although different reasons will be cited.
