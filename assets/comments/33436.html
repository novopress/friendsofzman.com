        If you want a civilization, you have to be completely intolerant of uncivilized behavior.  I hope that is coming, I see signs.

            Indeed. And to expatiate on your point, you must be willing to use barbarous methods to quell savagery. It is the only way. That, or evict the savages altogether.

                I am sorry, but your post is unacceptable, uncivilized, barbarous writing. “Expatiate” is used incorrectly.

                I tend to agree, but must note it seems we too often fall into the knee jerk response of proposing “tougher” and “tougher” measures when in reality the problem is that we *do nothing* in response to these provocations.  Not so much that the law is circumvented or flouted—it simply isn’t enforced at its most basic level.  Such is our current frustration.We see this many areas today.  Lawmakers are always up for *increased* penalties for all sorts of crime.  Yet, a simple investigation often reveals that the law against the crime is not enforced.  Changes in penalty of law have little cost relative to increased enforcement which is the fundamental driver of the criminality.  Pol’s love this sleight of hand.  They promote greater penalties while doing nothing to administer such.

                    I’m afraid enforcement of existing laws would only get us so far. Failing mass expulsion, the surest solution is internal separation maintained by periodic use of extreme force when that separation is breached.

                    The other truism to keep in mind is re: capital punishment, “After the first, all the rest are free.”
The higher the penalty, the greater the likelihood that someone who is not very good at impulse control will choose to shoot it out. Fortunately, there are no cases of poor impulse control here…

                        Yes indeed.  Some history—as I recall reading many years ago—GB in the 19th century had about 90+ capital crimes on the books.  Some of these were for crimes of theft like “pick pocketing in value greater than 1 shilling” or for “theft of wool greater than one pound”.        The result?  Not a lessening of such crime, but an increase.Merchants and the Courts petitioned for a more realistic punishment as they could no longer get convictions by juries that were reluctant to bring back guilty verdicts against children and other such criminals for such minor infractions of law.It’s not the penalty per se, it’s the probability of getting caught—and convicted—as well.

Either our women start producing live births of White children, else we vanish into extinction.

                    Strange set of pictures too. The blue backpack in the first image seems to have turned into a dog and been replaced by a red backpack in the second. I’m actually serious, the dog seems to be wearing the little crab plushie toy that was on the blue backpack. Or is the dog stuffed into the pack in the first picture? Then there’s the psychedelic color scheme. Is this a bad drug trip?The propaganda is obvious though. The girl alone in the wilderness not needing a man and with a dog instead of a kid. The whole thing also reminds me of all those stupidly predictable stories about a liberated chick going hiking in some third world shithole and being found dismembered or just vanishing.

                        Pozymandias, the only thing that matters anymore is whether we can get White wome n to push live White babies out of their birth canals.
Everything else we talk about is simply useless nonsense and a complete waste of our time.
No White Babies = No White Race = No Christianity = what the heck is the purpose of any of this?

                            Pozymandas, looking at it with evening eyes [rather than with morning eyes], it’s pretty obvious that they’re A.I. generated pictures.
I guess I’m so groggy in the morning that I can’t reliably &amp; immediately recognize A.I. generated shiznat.
Why would somebody on the staff of Brave order up A.I. generated pictures of childless White women in the mountains, to serve as Brave’s pictures of the day?
It doesn’t make any sense.
It’s White genocide propaganda.

                            Oh I agree. At some point all these conservative White dads are going to need to just tell their daughters and all young women that “probably the best career you can have is that of wife and mother to a bunch of White kids. Do whatever else you like as a hobby but leave work and industry to the men.”
I don’t use the Brave browser much but I have noticed it always seems to have some scenic images as backgrounds. It’s not surprising the pictures are chosen to push the usual agendas of feminism and anti-White ideology.

            Agreed.Black culture will need black law in order to survive. The black judicial system will have to be super simple, incredibly swift, incredibly fair – and incredibly brutal in order to keep them honest. Anything less means a regression to Africa.The fact is that blacks CAN be assimilated under those conditions – we’ve seen it since antiquity where blacks were primarily servants and slaves and criminals. The criminals self-deleted under the old empire with a minimum of muss and fuss and it worked well for everyone.However… I’d prefer that we picked our own damn cotton and built our own rockets. Elon can go pish up a rope.

            Had The Tyrant Lincoln lived, would he have followed through on his Liberia repatriation plans?  Talk about an intoxicating alternate history…
Instead, the old-timers came up with the best practical alternative: segregation.  Naturally, the enlightened smashed all that.  Chesterton’s fence.
It’s amusing and maddening whenever conservatives get indignant because blacks want a separate graduation ceremony or whatever.  Talk about obtuse…

                &gt;&gt; It’s amusing and maddening whenever conservatives get indignant because &gt;&gt; blacks want a separate graduation ceremony or whatever. Talk about obtuse…LMAO, to be fair it takes some psychological self reliance to go against the programming. I remember being totally repulsed by comments on the old chateau heartiste blog around 2017. Now I am literally Heetler if someone checks my posts.It takes a journey through people like Devon Stack and others to realize segregation was right and we were brainwashed to think otherwise under the post WWII new truth regime (or boomertruth if you follow AA).The wokies kind of want segregation and we only need to add a white only graduation ceremony, and white only dorms, etc to complete the plan. Like that parody where a clueless conservative (learn with JBP or something like that) compares a woke with a neo yathzee. The cluelessness is to imagine both are wrong about segregation and we should disapprove both. If a wokie wants a segregated anything, just create a white version of that too and complete the program!Cannot wait for a whites only Engineering school that will kick the ass of any other school in the planet!

                            I’m not even sure that’s true, @BigJimSportCamper. The Army was officially segregated until after WWII, and unofficially through at least Korea. Greatest came home to a segregated world, and largely believed it was correct. I’m not sure when the “We’re all brothers under the skin” became a majority belief. But it certainly was not at the time of Brown, or Selma, or even CRA. CRA was imposed, almost exclusively by self-righteous Yankees. Just as H-1bs are now imposed by our betters.

                                If Boomers are going to be blamed for politicians of their generation, Greatests and Silents should be blamed for theirs  — and that’s who gave us the CRA, not Boomer pols (who are guilty enough on other counts).

                                    That’s just begging the question — should they be?
For example, Millennials outnumbered Boomers in 2020. Are they to be blamed for open borders? Or do we start blaming the people actually responsible for breaking the law?
Or take Illinois. Whites are still 58% of the population. Are whites to blame for the murder rate in Chicago? Or do we start accepting that nogs killing nogs are to blame?

It is the governing elite that controls any of this. The governing elite are still mostly Boomers/Silents and have been since the late 1980’s or so.

Feminists looked at the same data, and used the same “logic” to conclude that the problem was the “patriarchy”, and blacks did the same and announced the problem was “whitey”.

                                The Boomers have been in power since about the 1980’s.I have to disagree just a little bit there; my sense is that it was the SILENTS who’ve been dominating our culture since at least 1960ish.B!tch McConnell, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Diane Feinstein, Charles Grassley, etc etc etc; that’s where the power accumulation has been for the last several decades.When [if?] Biden steps down, on January 20th, it will finally be time for the boomers to be fully in charge [without having to look over their shoulders in order to dodge the SILENT firing squad behind them].And after January 20th, the Boomers ain’t gonna surrender the throne for at least another 25 or 30 years.Gen-X and the Millennials can simply fuhgeddaboudit for most of the next half century.

                                No. That was Tom Brokaw. Can’t you get at least one fact right?
EDIT – Checking Wiki, there was an earlier reference too — General Fleet (b. 1892) said something similar in 1953. I’d never heard the term until Brokaw.

        Trump’s instincts are right. The Chinese are merely filling a vacuum that the USA left behind as the USA turned its focus to the Levant and the steppes. I read an article about how China invested $2B into Panama to get a project built and my first thought was, we couldn’t invest $3B and do the job ourselves? I find that part to believe. Well, Israel and Ukraine come first. Obama’s much vaunted “pivot to Asia” involved sending military assets into the Pacific, not minding our backyard.As has been said a million times though, this is what happens when your government gets taken over by a hostile group of foreigners who have no ties to the country. The government starts working for their interest, not ours. They do not care if China adopts the Monroe Doctrine as its own, or takes over the Panama Canal, or poisons the people with harmful drugs, or, for that matter, floods the country with foreigners – it’s not their country.

            No, the U.S. could not build those ports the way the Chinese did. With all the overheads imposed by managerialism, the political interference of special interests and the “10% for the big guy” corruption it would cost 3 times more AND unless it aligns with the economic interests of some oligarch there would be no will to do it.Face it China is an economic powerhouse their trade SURPLUS was 1 trillion $ so they have the capital to spend. Anything the U.S. does requires borrowed money.  Chinese are producers, Americans are consumers. I have no idea what’s next but I know all these academic ideas about regionalism or any other “isms” are just that. Academic.

                This is a fair point but it speaks to bigger issues with the USA and something that Trump surely knows about, considering unlike most of the people in charge he has actually built stuff in his life.I was reading an article the other day about the California wildfires and in the insurance industry, the “insurance expert” they cited never worked for an insurance company, never priced an insurance policy, he has a degree in political science and worked in liberal activist organizations his entire life. This is the American blob at this point, a bunch of people that do not know how to do anything or build anything. Compare it to prior generations where government leaned heavily on expertise in the private sector when it came time to do real work. The government does not and seemingly cannot do that anymore.

                ‘No, the U.S. could not build those ports the way the Chinese did.’I hate commies, but it’s obvious that China is a serious country.  Russia is a serious country.The U.S. over the past fifty years? Not a serious country.  Instead, a nation and people that dwell in a kind of mass delusion, a fantasy of how life should be, rather than is.  Sure!  Women can be men!  And don’t forget, Drag Queen Story Hour begins at noon.New Amerika places far more value on its woke and feminist agendas than on its own welfare and survival.  Not a serious nation.The joke down here is that the U.S. has 4 castes (yes, they use the word ‘castes’):1) children2) women3) household pets4) menI had to go 5,000 miles to find people who could see and express the plain truth.  When your living comes from scavenging trash off the streets, or taking in other people’s laundry, one cannot afford silliness and comfy delusions.

                The US has no business trying to out-commie the commies. Most states learned that in the early 1800s. “Public works” like canals were so rife with corruption that many states banned them in their Constitutions.
Rather than skirting the law with public-private ventures, Trump should have just played to America’s strength, the private joint-stock venture. Not only would it probably have come in under budget, it would also have state of the art tech.

                    While I don’t necessarily disagree, the tough part is that first step — how does one go from the DC corruptocrats to benevolent dictator? Our system was either designed or evolved to where it is today, and I don’t see much way of changing it. Nor do I see much in the way of realistic plans of overthrowing it. Or even working around it.

                China imports their food and energy and have to subsidise the crap out of their trinket exports. They cannot rely on their consumer base to prop up their economy. A diverse consumer base is what makes for strong economy. They are not in good shape.
And they beat the US for corruption. It’s at every level.

            Honestly, the stuff Trump has been talking about since the election is like some kind of comedy sketch where a company hires a guy to create some graphics for an ad campaign to sell, let’s say plastic buckets. After a few weeks they look at his output and… it’s all a bunch of drawings of Formula 1 racecars. Turns out he’s autistic and is deeply obsessed with F1 racing. The closest he got to doing the actual job was featuring one of the company’s buckets prominently in a picture of a car making a pit stop where they had it full of shop rags or something. It’s also baffling that he’s not even in office yet and is doing this. Has his Deep State minder told him that if he doesn’t do this shit they’ll send 27 more teenagers with rifles after him?Is this all some 42D chess strategy to baffle everyone so thoroughly that even his enemies can’t tell what he’s up to? A smokescreen prevents friendlies and enemies alike from seeing the battlefield after all. Or more likely, is this just an early start on his usual finking? I mean I knew he would fink on a lot of his promises but this is Olympic gold medal level finking.Time to plan for the Juneteenf celebrations in Thule I guess.

My experience with the talented 10% of black men is not a bad experience for the most part, we could work something out under a civilizational paradym.Men can get in a room most of the time and talk in real life terms and work it out.But the lunatics in HR and the women, and many times its the women, until we deal with how we have unleashed women in spheres they have no business being in we are going to have a hard time getting to a civilizational model in the west.Make motherhood and the honor of being a wife great again.

                Unfortunately, using the term, “resource,” to refer to humans is deeply embedded in the project management space, which in turn is deeply embedded in international business culture.

                This is the HR model my company uses.  HR implements my director decisions, and they orchestrate the benefits programs.  When I decide to terminate someone, HR ensures I have a layer of legal protection.

            Absolutely not.  The talented 10th are terrible.  They are the intellectual and financial elite of African Americans and they do absolutely nothing to reign in the lower individuals and they participate in (and even lead) the ridiculous outrages every time some black has an unpleasant interaction with anyone.Just recently an 11 year old girl in Syracuse (IIRC) was handcuffed for 7 minutes because she matched the description of a young girl who ran from a stolen car.  Now it’s a big story because, well, reasons.  Everyone is pretending this is a life altering event and an affront to all black people. Where is the black elite pushing back on this nonsense?  They’re leading the charge!    In many ways, the black elite is even worse than the bottom 50%.  They are perpetually offended and always looking to create a controversy.

                My one long-term black friend is among the “talented tenth” of everybody, statistically, not just of black Americans. He’s a great artist and funny guy, hit with the ladies, friend of billionaires (he’ll remind you)—and he’sblack.Meaning: He’s freakishly insightful about other people’s social minds—or, less flatteringly, he’shierarchy-obsessed. He’s a rigid credentialist, abject ass-kisser of the rich and powerful, truly hateful of the downtrodden (the bootstrap-conservative sub-type of anti-“workerism” communist), and he’s in a relentless status fight, always threatening to go physical, with every man whose rank is about the same as his—and if that dispute goes on long enough,every single timeit will devolve into “muh dik,” exactly as 4chan social science would predict. If appropriate to the setting, if no oneabovehim will witness it (and be disgusted) but only hear about it later (and laugh), he will literally whip it out.He’s fundamentally and unchangeably incompatible with rational Enlightenment liberal Christendom (etc.)—with “white society.” His charmed life proves we don’t live in one. And he rightly finds that hilarious.That’swhat being “tenth” gives him. Grandiose sociopathy.

Also, there is nothing novel about an Artic strategy to contain Russia and China. It’s been part of the MIC playbook since the start of the Cold War.

            To paraphrase Gregory Hood, Greenland is Puerto Rico with ice.  I’d concede that there are strategic benefits to bringing it under US control, but also lots of financial costs, maybe social costs as well. As usual, the Blob will enjoy the benefits while normie pays the bills/taxes.It also feels like a yuge distraction…a shiny object to keep MAGAtards enthused as Trump “underperforms” on immigration to placate Con, Inc and corporate interests.Z-Man has stated that Trump’s win is not necessarily about policy victories, but about voters breaking free from the Uniparty plantation (sorry if I’m garbling that, Z).  OK, I get it…but I have kids and feel a sense of urgency.

                    “Scandinavians” isa bit generous. According to its Wiki, Greenland’s demographics is barely 10% White European (What I would consider true Scandinavia). The other 90% are Inuit and Euro mongrels of varying degree. The whole nation has less than 60K residents. The GDP is just north of US $3 billion.  You can rest assured a large fraction of that is social payments by Denmark. It may be unfair to say the median Greenlander is a drunken, unemployed and perhaps unemployable Eskimo living on welfare, but I suspect that’s not far from the truth.

                            Well, Alaska sure does. Actually, what I’ve read about Alaska (and experienced as there are quite a few people in Oregon from there) is that pretty much everyone, White, Eskimo, or otherwise, is pretty drunk, stoned, tweaked-out, and fucked up most of the time. That said, I don’t think adding drunken Greenlanders to America’s ever growing list of dysfunctional minorities will have much effect. As Ben pointed out, the whole place has the population of a few neighborhoods in Northeast Baltimore and wouldn’t be much more of a burden than that is.Probably the best way to kill the Greenland idea is to meme it to death. Let’s flood the i-tubes with AI generated videos of polar bears drunk on malt liquor break dancing on the ice to rap music with Danish lyrics.

            Old-fashioned peace-through-purchase talk is in-character for Trump, so the Greenland stuff in his first term didn’t seem weird to anyone but anti-Trump hysterics. This term, it’spolicy—or at leastletting him talk about itis policy.That means “the blob” (or whatever) is kinda into it now, so we should pause and squint. Greenland island, so thoughts go straight to “geopolitics,” war shit, but that’s not primary in the blob mind.Domestic repression everywhereis.Has Denmark been in the news lately? (The regime watches a lot of TV.) Yes, oddly. They made news a while back by implementing a little bit of “far right” immigration restriction without electing any “far right” people—electionbeing the big first step that Our Democracy exists to thwart. Denmark skipped that and did a small favor for its people. That’s not allowed. Nothing is.So maybe that’s the deal. Turn the infinite jeets faucet back on, or lose your open territory (and the $$$ for Elon that’s hidden underneath)—the space you’ve reserved (not consciously) for white flight.

        Jews are not assimilated.  Jews never shut up about how they are Jews and therefore different.  They never stop trying to change the culture to benefit them.  They themselves claim they push concepts like multiculturalism and social justice because it benefits them as a small and vulnerable minority (their opinion, not mine).  Jews are a perfect example of a group that cannot be assimilated.  They came here from places they lived for hundreds of years where didn’t assimilate and claiming to be persecuted.

        Canada will never become the 51st state – at least, not willingly. We have too many neurotic and retarded old boomers that fear for the loss of their free healthcare and bennies, and east of Morontario and Queeeeeeebec… everyone is a slut, a pervert or a commie – but I repeat myself. Adding us to the GAE would be like tacking another basket case like California onto the nation.A more realistic alternative would be to pick off the western provinces – where we have more in common with folks like Montana and Texas than we do with the UFO’s and morons out east.As an Albertan, I am ambivalent. Sure, we periodically have faggots and cretins like Turdo to deal with… but you guys are in the same boat with retards like Obutthole and Pedo Joe.Perhaps civilizationalism will play a big part as North America balkanizes…

        Somewhat OT: There have been some very interesting developments in terms of the fate our of civilization and global sanity this last week courtesy of the ADL.Greenblat went to Israel and spoke to the Knesset where he called for using strategies like the pager attacks on global anti Semites. He said the pager attacks are part of the historical creativity of Jews. Given the Jews’ track record of killing people they don’t like that is something that should be taken seriously and it is safer to mull over the worst case scenario of his rather vague comments. As Ron Unz noted, per capita, Jews were the greatest mass murderers of the 20th century.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tGPTuMhajZsTo make this even more exciting, the ADL released at study finding that nearly 50 percent of people worldwide are anti Semitic.https://thehill.com/policy/international/5084936-antisemitism-adl-survey/Oy vey, that is a lot of pagers

The internet has been giving more and more people a look at the kind of stuff the ADL and other Jewish groups have been up to. This probably helps move that percentage higher. It would be interesting to see the trend over time. I’m guessing there’s been a strong bull market for antisemitism.

            ADL (of course) claims that nearly have of the world’s population is anti-Semitic. I usually just scan headlines; that seems like a reasonable claim even coming as it does from a world-class Jew booster. My saucy riposte would be, “Really, less than half? I would have expected a bit more.” And apparently it’s a “global emergency.” My inner cynic would parse that as “Jew™ is losing its cachet! Urgent measures are called for to restore brand recognition and respect!” Yeah, well, guys, your mask has slipped rather badly these past couple years.

            I still don’t believe Dr. William Pierce’s 2002 death from a “sudden, aggressive cancer” was the real story. When Yassir Arafat’s corpse was exhumed, his clothing was found to contain high levels of radioactivity. I don’t know if Dr. Pierce was buried or cremated. If buried and exhumed, I wouldn’t be surprised to find he was murdered by the usual suspects.

        My opinion, if we’re going to talk about our civilization, we’re inevitably going to be talking about the same things the Nazis talked about, which were the things we talked about before the Nazis stank up the joint. All of that scary Germanic/Nordic business. Oh no!I’ll be interested to see how that works. Does the issue age out, or do we have to make a distinction and disown them? Personally, I don’t mind owning a very bad wrong turn— like the Russians, I guess. Shit happens, get over it.Again, my opinion, let’s avoid sperging out like they did. Good place to start.

Canada, sure, but Greenland? Haven’t listened yet, but cold, humid weather, radar surveillance, SIGINT satellite down links, and some mines are the only things I’ve ever heard as part of “American civilization”; and the civilization part was always military.

                    I don’t think grabbing Greenland is wrecking Denmark. Denmark is one of the better EU states in terms of national sovereignty, so I’d hate to make them upset, but we would be relieving them of welfare payments and a whole bunch of useless ice. And we have millions of criminals that Denmark doesn’t have.

                    Greenland was ruled by Norway originally.  Norway came under Danish rule in the 16th century as did its overseas possessions. Norway was given to Sweden as part of the post-Napoleonic Wars political settlement and became fully independent in 1905. Its old overseas territories continued to be ruled by Denmark.

                    If not Denmark, one of the other Scandinavian countries whence came the Vikings who settled there.
But if Denmark is willing to sell, I think we should be willing to buy.  Aside from its usefulness as our own Rura Penthe and strategic location for military bases, there are valuable natural resources there.

        I like the concept of civilizationalism, but all the other distinct civilizations are generally racially based; China, India, Iran (Persia), Russia (ignoring the Asiatics).  Could America organize itself along civilizational lines?  At this point I think it’s too late. We’re so atomized we can’t even see ourselves as a unified block. The West has been trying to organize itself along economic lines at the expense of everything else that defines a civilization.

            Sure, in the same way the Russian Federation can. They don’t allow the headchoppers into Moscow, or, largely, even into Russia. They are more or less happy with things in the Stans, and the Russians mostly only have to interact with the 10%.

        The only way the rapidly declining dominant culture can reassert itself, is to absolutely quit obsessing over and putting up with the various subcultures, especially blacks.  I’d love to see it, but the propaganda over the past several decades is going to be hard to overcome.  Getting the majority of Whites on board will be THE challenge.

            Unfortunately, for at least the last 25 years I’ve felt the only thing that will wake whites up is a total economic collapse, Carrington Event, or some other calamity which will snap them back into the realm of natural and cultural reality, and a revival of common sense. As long as there’s one beer in the fridge and a sportsball game on TV, we’ll follow the rest of the lemmings off the cliff.

        “Language, culture, history, tradition, and religion are not immutable, but they are not malleable. These are things that resist the best efforts of the ideologues.”I wish it were so, but, with the provisional exception of language, these structures have been warped and deformed terribly by the postmodern ideologues of the last six decades. Indeed, this is why postmodernism is infinitely more pernicious than Marxism. It is one thing to have the proletariat slap up a bunch of robber barons in an effort to disperse the means of production. It is something else altogether to use power over knowledge to utterly obliterate the dominant culture and its history, traditions and religion. But that is precisely what has happened. The aesthetic blight that plagues us is a direct result of the unfolding cultural catastrophe. History has been dissimulated into a sustained demonization of white people’s ancestors. Tradition has been monetized almost out of existence. And where Christianity hasn’t vanished altogether, it has been refashioned into a vehicle of Leftist ideology.If “civilizationalism” has any hope of succeeding it must first recognize the true nature of the enemy, understand what has been lost and must be recouped, and be willing to take the most drastic measures to do so. Anything less will be a meaningless and Quixotic spasm.

            InCLASH OF CIVILIZATIONSand his logical America-specific follow-upWHO ARE WE?, Samuel Huntington posited these attempts to destroy culture usually fail spectacularly. The PoMo’s are hardly the first to attempt such. I wish someone would do a scholarly work on it, but a recent example has been the explosion of Hawaiian culture after it was all but dead after a century. It is nothing short of astonishing. Unless the embers are extinguished through genocide, and this is what PoMo seeks, they are nigh impossible to extinguish.

                    There may be some of that since the active suppression ended a while back, but the culture being replaced is in essence an essentially hodgepodge Asian one, mostly American-influenced Japanese. The native and Asian tribes have been at loggerheads since the latter wanted statehood and the former opposed it. But, yeah, while both are anti-white, I would give the edge to the Polynesian hostility. Still, the point about the difficulty of cultural erasure remains.

                        But was native Hawaiian culture really suppressed? In the 70s, and even into the 80s, the popular culture depicted Hawaii as culturally Hawaiian, not Asian. Indeed, so much so that one would have thought Hawaii was about 75 percent ethnically Hawaiian. Granted, one must not put too much stock in the accuracy of pop culture depictions, but in this case the depictions ring true. If for no other reason that tourism dollars, it would have made sense to husband Hawaiian culture rather than suppress it. I mean, really. You can get your sushi in Davenport, Iowa and your General Tso’s chicken in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, but for a luau and hula dancers you need to head to Hawaii.

                            It was legit suppressed through the Eighties outside of what was obviously promoted as tourism/corporate marketing gimmicks. What you describe is superficial, of course, sort of like what Cracker Barrel is to native Alabamans. In a true twist of fate, the old Polynesian culture got refreshed from what amounted to hula shirts and dances in KFC ads (two fast food references in one reply, sheez). The seeds of cultural revival were planted in the schlock to the horror of the GAE, though. About thirty years a bone was thrown by allowing the native language to be taught again and that fueled the fire. We don’t hear much on the mainland but things get rather nasty there from time to time.If I had to place a bet on the first state to gain semi-official autonomy at least in part it would be Hawaii, or at least a big portion of it, which likely will happen in the next ten or so years. The GAE will keep its bases and Cloud beaches as long as it can of course but there most likely will be an expansion of sovereignty, now largely confined to the tiny islands of Ni’ihau. The fact that exists even now is a testament to what a fraud the Regime knows multic-culturalism is.This is relevant to us because it shows how difficult it is to suppress culture and society. I fluctuate between optimism and black pill overdoses but try to keep grounded. And as an aside, Polynesian culture sucks donkey balls, but it is resilient. There is some hope.

                That work doesn’t exist because almost nobody reads philosophy, and politics isn’t influenced by it (anymore). The left/”left” do occasionally mention postmodernists’ names—the same way lesbian priests mention Jesus—but those are just shibboleths, signs of fealty (or the opposite, when made by outsiders), school ties.

Globohomo is post-philosophical. It’s not an intellectual phenomenon and can’t be understood as one—at all. The regime is just people who know each other and hate you.

            Whereas most other civilizations have distinct cultures and racial profiles, Western Civilization is an amalgamation of the three main ethnic groups of Europeans; Germanic, Romanic and Slavic. Christianity was the original organizing institution that was able to consolidate large swathes of these disparate groups into a unified civilization. Now that Christianity’s power has been greatly curtailed, what serves as the unifying institution now? To my mind, the myths of the 20th century serve as the foundation for post-WWII Western Civilization; egalitarianism, multiculturalism, feminism and all the other ‘isms’ dividing and destroying our societies. This is why you don’t let an out-group define your civilization.

        With all respect, you have got a lot of things wrong or upside down, Mr. ZMan.First, the civilisational approach existed long before Mr. Huntington was even born. The first book introducing civilisational framework known to me is Danilevskiy’s “Почему Россия не Европа” (“Why Russia is not Europe”), which was published in the XIX century. There are also Leontiev, Khomyakov and a lot of other authors who did not talk precisely in those terms, but belong to that school of thought. In the Western countries, you have Spengler and Toynbee. I understand that people have been dumbed down a lot in the USA, but at least Spengler should have been mentioned.Second, you do not understand Russian realities. I can’t blame you for that, since you are not here. But sometimes it becomes quite ridiculous. For example: you mention Dugin in the podcast. I am personally puzzled why you like mentioning him so much (I mean not only your blog, but American audiences). He is not discussed a lot here (maybe I hear about him about once a year or so), and he is just an opportunist who serves the power structure, not a philosopher who should be taken seriously. There is no “Eurasianism” in the real life – we have an Eastern (Orthodox) European civilisation. Further, minority indigenous peoples of Russia are not a part of being Russian.Some of them are tolerable, but if they moved to the Moon tomorrow, we would not lose anything. Even better – we would rid ourselves of Chechen criminals and handouts (reparations) to Caucasus, for example. This whole “Eurasianism” crap is a cover for Putin’s version of non-White invasion. We just have a different constitution of occupiers – they mainly come from the Central Asian and Caucasus states (and some regions of Russia, like Chechnya or Tyva).Oh, and I didn’t even get to the fact that we have here our own oligarch power structure, which serves the Russian people like the American political apparatus serves the Americans…But it could be continued indefinitely. Just begin with understanding that you know almost nothing about Russia, and a lot of what you think you know has little or no connection to reality, even if you are critically minded and don’t trust the official propaganda media.Best wishes from snowy Moscow!

            I am personally puzzled why you like mentioning him so much (I mean not only your blog, but American audiences).Probably because he has some interesting things to say about our situation here in the west. His summation of the distinction between classical and modern American Liberalism is extremely pithy, and very on-point.This whole “Eurasianism” crap is a cover for Putin’s version of non-White invasion.

                His summation of the distinction between classical and modern American Liberalism is extremely pithy, and very on-point.Maybe, but there is too much attention to such a figure. There are a lot of writers here who deserve more coverage than Dugin, but are generally unknown to the foreign public. For example, L.N. Gumilyov (yes, he is the son of our great poet N.N. Gumilyov, who was executed by chekists). He was a member of the Academy of Sciences, published a lot and created his own school of thought. I haven’t seen his “Ethnogenesis and the Biosphere of the Earth” translated into English yet. Igor Schafarevitch’s “The Socialism Phenomenon” is more known to you, but a lot of Schafarevitch’s other works are not. And he is himself a genius (an algebraic topologist who completed his PhD thesis at 19, doctoral thesis at 23 and became a member of the Academy at 28). And there are lots of others.And Dugin has tainted himself by his association with the official powers. It is possible to judge his writings separately, but I just can’t have a serious attitude to him.One suspects the alternative would be the American “alphabet” agencies trying to weaponize those populations just like they have the Ukraine.No, the alternative would be to send them home, where it’s sunny, warm and a they have a lot of picturesque mountains. The main three-letter agencies’ agent here is Vladimir Vladimirovitch. 🙂If we had a choice, I would prefer Lukashenko to be the head of Russia. He has his flaws, but he is a real man. Belorussia is much more pleasant than Russian Federation – they have no foreigners, people are generally nicer, the country fares good, even though it is much smaller than Russia.And. of course, I would like to have a state that incorporates Russia, the Ukraine and Belorussia. We are different branches of the Russian people, and the current war benefits only our enemies.

            Yes. That Francis Fukuyama hasn’t been laughed off the stage speaks volumes, but Samuel Huntington is begrudgingly acknowledged as a prophet among serious scholars. The reason Huntington really is hated, though, was his subsequent book WHO ARE WE?, which correctly noted that America properly understood was a White Anglo-Saxon civilization and could not withstand the Hispanic deluge in its early stages at the time of the publication. It was a logical inference to be drawn from CLASH, of course, but, racism. It isn’t too much to suggest Huntington was straight-up reviled from the time of its publication to his death.

                    Fukuyama wasn’t alone.  He and any number of others were touting we—meaning no less than democracy—had won the war for national expression.  Read his rather long and ponderous best seller at the time.  The 21st century was to be the “American Century”.  Pure hubrus. Took only a couple of decades for his foolish optimism to be revealed.

        When Kevin Leery was still doing standup he joked we should just invade Canada, “We’ll call it: OPERATION LEAFBLOWER!”
Canada is a mess.  They’ve turned their cities into a Star Wars bar scene of central, south, and East Asians.  It’s shocking to travel around Calgary and not see any actual Canadians.

The U.S. is the gold standard for globohomo, so our “leaders” seek to imitate if not outdo that example.

        We believe neither in the transcendent nor in the immanent. We only believe in memories and daydream of the impermanent.Humans go to rather ludicrous lengths to try to build some sort of legacy.We are neither evil nor virtuous – only terminally naive.

        I see Auron MacIntyre is getting a lot of play withCut Zoomers Some Slack | 1/16/25 – YouTubeWhich is good, in terms of maybe helping people understand what’s happening, and a reasonable explanation of how we got here. But just like so much out there, it’s completely bereft of any action items to fix it.Gen Z came from broken homes. OK, how do we fix that now? Crickets. Society needs to create an environment in which Z can flourish. OK, what’s the first step? Creeping credentialism, housing and educational hyperinflation, inadequate or absent role models, crickets.The one thing that it seems is a possibility is when he pointed out that the middle class tended to be higher-ups, or owned their own businesses. The workman would likely die a renter. That was largely true up until both parties insisted home ownership was a right. And like the right to a college education, the results are unmistakable. And, sadly, predictable to anyone with more than about 4 functional brain cells.

        Is it possible Trump is talking about buying Greenland and taking back the Panama canal as a way for Putler to relate to him? It’s a lot easier to make deals with someone if they think you are on the same page. I think Russia taking parts of Ukraine and the usa taking back the canal both make sense.

        Call out uncivilized behaviors wherever, whenever. No need to get rough, just loud enough to embarrass them (assuming they have even a vestige of social awareness). The burka’d lady jumping the queue, the foreigner who pats your daughter bottom at an event, the RATOS (recent arrivals to our shores) kids getting rowdy on the bus etc. Say something or you will end up fuming over it all day. “That is not acceptable behavior in this country, you will have to amend your actions if you want to get along here”.ps-thought for the weekend–why do alien spacecraft need outside lights, it’s not like they are up there bumping into each other in the dark, surely they have anti collision technology as well as cloaking ability, so why the blinking running lights etc. It’s government issued stuff designed to baffle and disconcert earthlings.
