        The Harris/Walz act is the ultimate flex on the plebes by the Deep State. The subliminal, if not outright, message is: “we’re in charge, we can run whomever the hell we want – even these doofuses – print up the ballots and ram it down your throat”. At least Obama was polished and sober, thereby lending a veneer of dignity to the proceedings. This farce is at a Vaudeville level of kitsch and frivolity.

                Element? The sadism is the whole point. You think they want to replace white people in order to boost GDP?

                    Genocide of whites through replacement, demoralization and persecution, is the central theme of Western regimes in this day and age. They are already so culpable that they could not divert from it now even if they wanted to. They know that if we survive and reclaim our native lands they will be forever known as the darkest traitors ever to curse the lands of the West with their vile and corroding presence. They are the exemplars of what never to tolerate. And they know this

        Walz gives me major Sandusky vibes, especially as all his extracurriculars seem to involve spending time with kids, taking them to China or setting up the gay club or what have you. I know they picked him as a salt-of-the-earth type of normal guy, and also one who just happened to bend the knee to the head girlboss and the liberal system, but it doesn’t work when he just has major creep energy.

            He’s just a harmless pudgy and misguided goofball of a politician. I think he’s a decent guy at the core. He should be selling pest control services, but instead the Democrat party convinced him that he should be the VP of the GAE. This is the tragedy of it, and I feel sorry for him. The Democrats did the same to Joe Biden…they pick front runners based on looks and malleability alone, not for any substance. The Dems deserve to rot in hell.

                Maybe. My gut could be totally off on this, but I doubt I’m the only one. I still wonder how a guy from a literal nowhere district in Minnesota becomes governor and now VP pick. We all know about the operations that go on to ensure these peoples’ loyalties to the regime.

                Sorry, but I see an otherwise normal guy who’s gotten swept up in liberal politics. He reminds me of a Democrat version of Rob Ford, the former mayor of Toronto, who in any other era would be a chubby and gregarious pest control salesman, but instead finds his way into politics and is made the head of a large polity that he does not understand and is set up for a major embarrassment. Rob Ford was so clueless that he smoked crack. Walz is equally clueless, though he doesn’t do drugs apparently. Maybe he gets high on liberal platitudes. Whatever. But I don’t see an evil man on the TV screen.

                    But I don’t see an evil man on the TV screen.That may or may not be true, you cannot tell what is in someone’s heart. Maybe he got carried away on his progressive liberalism. Maybe he doesn’t really “like” little boys.All we can do is judge him by what he has said and done, not by how he appears in a choreographed tee-vee program.In a way, his just getting swept up in the “progressive moment” is worse than if he is a psychotic true believer. An empty vessel can be as bad or worse than a true believer. It’s one of the many things I don’t like about Harris.

                I agree with your sentiment Ostei, but if that is the case, I don’t understand the P Diddle blow up that has erupted into the current news cycle.Why would the Regime allow these events and revelations to take place now?Nothing good can come from it, based on their predilections.The people coming out of the woodwork, and the ones being vindicated,(I didn’t know who Katt Williams was till this week), are plentiful, and appear to view the situation as an opportunity to tell their stories.Something is afoot.

                    Nah, its just a shield. Accept our politics or we will call you names! Sadly it just shows that most people don’t have spines to defend what they believe in. But then again, wasn’t the American revolution only around like 5% of the total population. 99.9% of people are followers. Its in our DNA, can’t blame them for the natural inclination. It’s only when you explain why they’re wrong and they still follow that i find them to be subhuman.  Take any democrat policy and it essentially gives them more control of money flows and centralizes power to their minions.  It is why the money has to go kaput, its the only thing that will stop this.  Not much longer now i’d say

            My rule is always be suspicious of adults who want to access other peoples’ children when their own children are not involved.  Like little Timmy’s dad volunteering to coach little league is not really that suspicious, but childless Joe or Joe with grown children down the street wanting to coach little league is a red flag that should not be ignored.
This is one of the things they took away from us by ruining our communities.  Though, admittedly, this has always been a problem. But it is a far bigger problem today.

                This is both true and not true.
Male teachers used to be ubiquitous.
No any young man who, when asked “What do you want to do for a career?” and answers “I want to be a K-12 teacher” is immediately assumed to be a pedo, gay, or both.
Downstream effects are than young men don’t actually engage with actual men until high school, and maybe not until college.
It’s a problem.
I’ve no solutions.

        “Will we see waves of phony ballots mysteriously turning up in the dead of night again? It is hard to rig two elections in a row and always a bad idea to try it.”Need you ask? Of course they will. And why is it a bad idea to do it twice? They did it flagrantly the first time around and got away with it scot-free. It will be easier the second time. They’ve got the hang of it now. The only thing that might stop it is violent demonstrations, cities ablaze, and the like. Something like 1968. But middle America is not good at that kind of thing.

My prediction is that the Israeli response is going to be underwhelming.
Mainly because AINO’s ability to supply munitions is stretched very thin at this point. Also because Iranian defenses will prove far tougher than expected, especially if the Israelis send jets rather than missiles.

My dad was watching FoxNews, and some military guy was talking about that, about a shaky Iranian domestic situation, about Arab nations being threatened by Iran, too. It was vaguely Ukraine-ish. I thought, There’s no way they’ll fight Iran to the last drop of Israeli blood! Right? Maybe I read it completely wrong, but it was jarring.

                Not that I think the right getting violent as a good thing, because I don’t, I also don’t see the right doing much of anything in that area.Even just a good old fashioned riot isn’t likely to happen.  Leftists usually riot in areas they control. That is how they get away with it.  The right isn’t going to burn down their own towns and cities.   They will be dealt with in the harshest way were they to try it in any of the blue cities.

                The reason liberals have a rheostat on violence and conservatives do not is because conservatives represent a subjugated population while liberals are allowed to make meaningful choices with the direction of the country. We are not represented in D.C. whereas the whole of the ruling class is their loose association of self-serving tribes. Team Trump exists in their paradigm of having meaningful choices because Team Trump are reform Democrats with the possible exception of JD Vance.This is your regular reminder that the American Civil War crushed dissent on both sides of the line, the National Guard forced integration at gunpoint, and the FBI has been busy ever since. A subjugated population has either compliance or revolt with little meaningful in-between. Add in the fact that our public education system is designed to make subservient factory workers, then borrow some recent thoughts on a population with no organizing features lurching from crisis to crisis, and you begin to suspect that passive sportsball enjoyers are about the best you can hope for from the average American. They are living the slave dynamics of the system they exist in after all.Another sliver of the population are likely to become involved once a slave revolt shows some success, but no one can or should expect more before then. A revolt is the way to bet too, since those with power see calls to reform as a slight to their petty sense of personal divinity. Do keep in mind that America is a twisted funhouse of shadows and mirrors, so a revolt may not entirely follow the normal script either.

                This type of thing is sickening to me; the blatant lying abd telling readers, get ready for the steal.in confessions Augustine is in this liminal headspace where he is still operating as basically a law professor, but honestly seeking the truth of life the universe etc. I wish I could find the quote but he was giving a speech about the emperor where he just lied and he even says everyone knew he was lying, but the implication was that that’s how things went.he talks a lot about the wretchedness of living like that especially when you don’t care and you just become the lie and go beyond not caring and live lies.  Obviously he cared but couldn’t yet pull himself out of it cause of what he knew he would lose: status, respect, the praise of man. I think that sometimes is more of a draw than money

                AZ has had to announce recently that over 200k mail in ballots are being sent to folks *not* confirmed to be citizens!  This after 3+ years to review/contact those people and ask for citizenship documentation as per (upheld) AZ law and remove them from State voting (shorter Fed only ballot).This means that those questionable citizens will receive “full” ballots and vote in national offices—and State offices!  We often concentrate on national elections, but locally these offices decide whether the State turn solid, hard blue and the future electoral shenanigans Blue vs Red entails.Same old, same old.  I will vote under the new process on Election Day and report back—and no, this doesn’t mean I’ve changed my mind on voting.  I’ve always said I will vote *once* again if Trump runs.

                There are reasons. First and foremost, middle America is invested in the established order (dysfunctional and blatantly unfair though it is). Invested in the sense that they have jobs, mortgages to pay, children to bring up, food to put on the table. The loony left, on the other hand, can summon up flash mobs of jobless noggers and backpackers at the snap of Soros’s fingers. There’s just no comparison.One thing I failed to mention is the boa-constrictor hold the system of censrorship now has, which was nowhere near so draconian exactly four years back (but which came into place from January 2021 onwards). Everything we want to say cannot be said in media space. There is no dissent on social media or mass media because of censorship (“community standards”). There’s probably more freedom of speech in China and Russia.

            How could they not steal the election a second time:  There are an extra 20 million illegals who have been signed up on the rolls, and the integrity of the voting system is no better than the integrity of the southern border.

            Do not underestimate how many women have had abortions and their feelings.
It’s not just the ones that have had abortions, it’sallwomen. Any restrictions on abortion at all means some level of sexual accountability for women. Accountability triggers the female hindbrain and introduces a level of panic in them. There is no reasoning with this as it is almost entirely subconscious and reflexive.

                The rhetoric of abortion is about sex, especially on the pro- side. People seeming to speak freely of fucking is highly suspicious. In what other context is heterosexual sex a part of public discourse? There aren’t even boobs in movies for boys anymore. It’s the subject of media outrages and criminal trials, not polite conversation. What even stronger taboo is being preserved by talking about good ol’ fashioned boy-impregnates-girl sex—the worst thing in the world? (It’s even racist.)My everyday observation* of mothers, especially mothers of male children, is consonant with crime stats: Women hate their children and want to destroy them. Outside of abortion children are rarely killed, but when they are, Mom did it (or arranged it). Child murder is the only expression of female nature allowed in a society where normal woman life has been so obliterated it’s become a dissident fetish (“tradwife,” “breeding,” etc). Girlbossing on SSRIs and birth control is completely messed up, socially and bodily, a painful dissonance with nature, history,desire, etc. A child’s death at her hands—her one availablechoice—resolves it.Before Roe, discretionary abortion,at whimabortion, was called “therapeutic.” Euphemisms do come true.*My family, profession, and life have a great overrepresentation of Jews in them, you may note at this point. But that makes them more representative of “society,” which they own.

                    Fair enough. My experience of Jewish women is limited and not intimate, but they do seem more assertive, let’s say, to me.
My experience of Gentile women is that they’re deeply conflicted. Most are moms at heart, but they’ve been programmed differently. Impose a foreign culture on people, as you note, watch the mayhem.

                Yep.  And that female hindbrain can’t figure out that in just about every State, abortion is not being eliminated, only restricted to generally accepted limits of application, which will never affect them in their desire to terminate a pregnancy.Here in AZ we have a proposition on the ballot concerning basically “unlimited” abortions being made part of the Constitution!  The ad’s are non stop which state that this constitutional amendment *must* be passed to assure abortion is (again) made legal in AZ.  No where do the ad’s explain that in AZ abortions *are* legal and unregulated up to 15 weeks, and thereafter for the *physical* health of the mother!  This law was passed 2 years ago under a Rep legislature.Of course, thisblatantlie is designed to drive young females to the polls to vote Dem on other issues and offices.  Rationale thinking (as vs emotional) in not a female trait.

                “Any restrictions on abortion at all means some level of sexual accountability for women.”Yep.Ever wonder why abortion became legal and widespread only about ten years after The Pill? Because women were too stupid and feckless and irresponsible to use The Pill consistently and effectively.It’s noteworthy that today, surgical abortions are on the decline, and most abortions are pharmacological ones using the so-called “Plan B” or “morning after pill.”In other words, they are too irresponsible to take a pill to prevent conception before intercourse… but they will take a pill to kill the fetus or embryo after.Nietzsche was right about women.

You sure you aren’t thinking of schopenhaur?  Honestly, if you observed in high school that would have taught you all you needed to know about women.  The majority of the people you meet are exactly the same at 40 as they were in high school.

            “Do not underestimate how many women have had abortions”
The most common number for decades was about a million per year (in the 50 years sinceRoe). Assuming for the sake of the argument that these were not second or third abortions, that’s 50 million women.
If we allow that this model might overestimate the number by as much as 20%, that is still 40 million women.

        Every business owner I know, including myself, spends a significant amount of time on succession. Do we have the people in place to pick up the slack if I drop dead or get sick of it all and retire? Are we keeping those people happy, or are they looking to get experience and bounce to another firm or start their own firm? Trump has a business owner brain. V.P.s aren’t picked with succession in mind, unless you count the: “better keep me alive because my V.P. is worse” kind on succession planning. I don’t watch debates because, honestly, I’d rather watch grass grow, but I watched last night. The meanest thing Trump could do to the managerial state is to win the election and resign at two years and one day. Ten years of Vance would fill up the insane asylums.

        There are a couple of different arguments for why Walz was chosen by Harris. One is that the top tier of options like Shapiro didn’t want to be her VP in part because she is such a dunce.  The other is that this is another link in the Democrats incompetence chain. Obama picks Biden because he knows Biden won’t show him up, Biden picks Harris because he wanted a non white woman she is the dumbest one his people can find. Harris is so dumb she needs to stoop to Walz to make her look better by comparison.  I don’t see how the government could continue in its current form after eight years of Harris-Walz so this may be the end of the chain on that theory.  Could also be a combination of the two.

            I actually saw some speculation a few weeks back that there was a much more sinister purpose behind the choice of Walz. I’d have to track down the exact piece again, but it was pointed out that the Great Replacement has essentially been accomplished by the Left in Minnesota. Not only have they swamped the state with Somalians to “vote” reliably Left, but they also recruited welfare cases from Chicago to move to Minnesota with the promise of more gibs. Apparently the Democrat party was actively involved in scheming out this replacement and Walz – although certainly not the mastermind – was heavily involved on the ground making it happen. Could be that he was chosen for his familiarity with Great Replacement tactics in hopes he could help bring that to more states under Kamalatoe as “replacement czar”. Could also be that the Left thinks they’ll easily “fortify” their way to victory again, so they don’t really care what the VP pick brings to the ticket in terms of votes.

                I can confirm they have implemented the Great Replacement well in Minnesota, although a big part of it has been driving normie Republicans out of the state, something that can’t be replicated nationally. The reason he was able to cite a decline in rental rates in Minneapolis is that so many people have left the city.  The county just over the border in Wisconsin used to be a Democrat county and now votes 60-40 Republican. It arguably saved Ron Johnson seat in 2022.  It has been a thirty year project in Minnesota and Walz is such a dunce his impact on it has been minor.

                If we can trust the census data, Minnesota is still about 73% white and only 8% Hutu. The Great Replacement still has a way to go there. But given that Minnewhites have the backbone of a walleye and the testicular fortitude of a begonia, they won’t dare stand in the way.

        They stole the hell out of the 2022 election. The economy was down, inflation soaring, hunter’s laptop was in the news. Biden’s approval was in the mud.  Despite it all, for the FIRST time in us history the out party, the GOP, lost seats in a midterm election. Both House and senate. To put this in perspective, in 1984 Regan won 49 states in the presidential election, but in the 1986 midterms the democrats picked up both hous and senate seats. So yes they will steal it, and the GOP will blame Thump for the loss .  Remember that the GOP was in on the 2020 steal. They will also steal a lot of down ballot elections . This will extend to the state level too.  Covid taught them they had nothing to fear from the people.

        His overly-caffeinated Elmer Fudd routine might be fine for the folks back home, but for the rest of the country it suggests there is something disturbing about his private life.
His choosing to be the faculty advisor for a high school gay student grooming club and his support of  radical transgender politics suggests there is something disturbing about his private life.

        To me, Walz’s bizarre progression of facial expressions are a tell that he’s trying to conceal certain things about himself.
Obviously this failed when the moderators, who were totally biased for him, managed to trip him up on his China experiences.
One wonders what else Walz may be concealing behind those beady eyes of his.

            I have not watched a single minute of Walz video, so I’m unfit to judge. However, based upon y’all’s description of him, it sounds to me like he’s extremely uncomfortable inside his own skin. Is that an accurate statement?

        The problem really lies in the fact that AINO isn’t a real country any longer.  Since “anyone can be an American” then no one is an “American”.  No longer being a White country and loads of juice propaganda has made what used to be normal people into deranged psychopaths.  No matter who is elected, the current trajectory won’t really change.  You can’t have a functioning society with factions of people who do not want anything close to the same things.  It cannot work.  It used to be that Americans all wanted the same thing, but disagreed on the best ways to obtain them.  That no longer exists.  I can’t find common ground with someone who believes a man can be a woman, that sex with children is ok and that worshipping violent negros is mandatory.  There is so much hatred that it can never be fixed.  So while the picks here may very well be “crazy vs normal”, even if normal wins, the crazies won’t ever let the normals live in peace.

i just saw dinesh desilvas trump movie. I know i know. But someone asked trump why is America so great: freedom.
well I’m sorry but it needs to be more narrow and exclusive than that or what you have is a crowd. Not a community with common loves abd not a society with a common purpose or goal
america is NOT a country. I guess it still fits a def of empire maybe

        I’d opt more for a cross of Chris Farley and John Wayne Gacy.  Hopefully, the worst case is Walz ends up in a “van down by the river”.  Don’t drink on weekdays, but ended up busting out a bottle of rye after about 15 minutes.  But there is something seriously wrong with Walz.  Apparently some guy checked in with the St. Paul PD today and didn’t find any evidence his kid was anywhere near a Rec center shooting. Kid already has development problems, no normal person would  pimp him out that way.

        Re: rigging….. Harris has almost certainly already won North Carolina. You can look at a blue/red county by county map for yourself and see that the western mountains are the deep red side of the state and that without them, NC goes D. And it seems unlikely that very much of that region will have power barely 4 weeks from now on election day. Much of it doesn’t even currently have road access. You can safely predict that turnout will be way down in those red counties. They will get power restored to Asheville, which has road access. Asheville is blue. So the one part of the region we can be sure will be “online” is blue. There is every incentive for the regime, to include the WH, the governor’s office, politically motivated people at FEMA et al to slow walk aid to the region for this very reason. I would say that Ron DeSantis recognized this and is why he immediately began directing aid from Florida to NC.I have seen some folks online saying the Ds used HAARP to produce this very outcome. While I don’t discount the possibility that HAARP (or whatever it’s called) could spin up a tropical storm or even a hurricane, I have an impossible time believing that they could subsequently direct it and control its speed and intensity, all of which would have been required to have produced this result.

        That the headlines this morning were not “I Have To Visit Worldstar To Regularly See Beatings Like the VP Debate” shows just how meretricious the media is. I rarely watched debates, but I could not stop watching the absolute shellacking Vance gave Walz. Any person that could write, and anyone that could believe, that the debate was anything other than an absolute smackdown should have their ability to vote stripped.For the record, I don’t vote, so my views are not some perverse form of wishful thinking.

            For the Dem to lose the debate, they have to basically lose the ability to speak, like Obama in 2012 and Biden in June. It’s also worth noting that the debate is done entirely within the liberal frame. The questions yesterday were about climate change, school shootings, etc., all stuff designed to be a layup for the Dem. It’s not like Vance can go out there and say, “well, you know, most violent shootings in the USA are due to blacks in inner cities in spontaneous acts.”

                    And, of course, he can’t. If he’d said that, the entire Power Structure, including the GOP, would have arisen in a unified mighty roar demanding Trump jettison Vance from the ticket or else there would Congressional hearings to determine if Trance could be barred from the general election and perhaps prosecuted for hate crimes or suchlike.

                        All true, and it just shows how unserious the entire GAE is, because you can’t have a solution if you can’t talk about the problem. They have intentionally locked themselves up in a fantasy world. Of course this is not the first time in world history that the imperial court has done this. And yes, I do think Vance absolutely knows the score on this.

                        No, I don’t think you can say that actually. You can debate how much these people actually believe in these various things they say (e.g., I think that they all pretty much know and understand that climate change is a big grift), but on the magic dirt/blank slate/”woke” explanation of discrepancies, all indications are that they are totally sincere, believe it, and defend it, and this goes for conservacucks as well as liberals.

        “taking notes so he could tattle on Vance to the teacher”
This has become a serious phenomenon, especially among those who have been educated by our feminized educational system.  But I see it with all ages and social classes now.  On both sides of the Pond.  When I was a kid, tattling meant “social death.”  Now we’re in a society of snitches.  Isn’t it lovely?

                It’s fine when a guy who’s famous for writing a book about how white people suck and deserve to be ground under the heel of history does it.
Years ago when he was suddenly being promoted via every every media outlet—as /ourguys/ always are—I wondered if the joke was that his fake name combines “J.D. Power and Associates” from truck commercials with Vance Packard, the great anti-advertising writer who disarmed with his farm-boy name (legit).
He is unusually smart for a politician.

        None of us knows if there is a margin at which an election cannot be fortified successfully, but it probably exists. Is this one outside of that margin? This assumes a totally blatant theft would present a problem, and if that is the case it would be solely for international PR purposes.I have tuned out elections but did watch the debate last night for my first time this cycle. Everything you wrote is spot on. Elections matter around the margins on very minor things, perhaps, but the Regime does what the Regime wants to do. Elected officials essentially are powerless. Laws, rules and regulations truly are for the little people. The Regime does seem to be in some sort of retreat, though, and the chosen puppets Harris and Walz highlight that slump.Finally and as an aside, the archaic forms of medium such as television pretty much are done as propaganda organs. The Dunning-Kruger moderettes realize the gig is up so the facade was dropped. If the opportunity presents, there will be massive censorship crackdowns on the new information sources, and one white pill is that will likely be futile in the long run. Maybe the loss of the cordon sanitaire of controlled media is behind the Regime’s retreat, which isn’t severe enough yet to slow the cultural enrichment of mass migration.

            2020 was “outside the margin of fraud.” Some suspect, with some cause, that in reality it was the most lopsided election in American history, approaching the fake results in leftist dictatorships. So the inauguration was a military occupation of D.C.—staged and televisedas such. We pretend that didn’t happen, but it did. Trump was never Commander-in-chief, and he never will be.The vote is a ritual, not a problem. It can simply be ended, as it has been in the Democratic Party. The stripping of meaning from their votesincreasedDemocrat voters’ partisan enthusiasm, as the most cynical among us predicted (having seen it before). Maybe those responsible aren’t smart enough to have planned that, or to see the causal arrow. That’s a hope.

                I am an agnostic regarding the 2020 margin of fraud but agree with almost all of your rest. Throughout the GAE the empty ritual of election is becoming more and more transparently farcical. Just yesterday, for example, Marine Le Pen was arrested. Conviction would bar her from holding public office for a decade and carry a sentence about that long. She has been the odds-on favorite for president in 2027 and has voiced a desire for France to exit NATO. And on and on. The United States treats its satrapies in the same way as the Soviets did theirs and was likely behind Le Pen’s arrest…Occupied D.C. at the 2020 inauguration indeed has been memoryholed. In due time posting pics of the barb wire and obese National Guard troops behind it will result in arrest.It is a useless enterprise, but I do spend time speculating on how long things have been this bad, and why it has suddenly become overt.

        Walz was not picked to make White liberals trust Karackulla. He was picked to make some who were on the fence and concerned about the vicious anti-White attack dog act of Biden and 2020-2024 (until Biden dropped out), messaging and the actions of the Regime as a whole. The message he sent was, “Hey White guy. You can be involved, but only if you are willing to humiliate yourself, be a goof in an anti-White minstrel show and happily, nay joyfully, embrace being subordinate to the DIE hire HR lady.”How many of the maybe-not-so-broken White men who would entertain a vote for the anti-White party at this point who would be swayed by last night? Who knows. It is excellent that Vance made the difference crystal clear. A confident, intelligent, articulate and strong White man has a future in leading post-America and maybe even back to being America is still in the cards. Seeing the contrast is a good thing if only to keep in people’s minds the image of Vance represents.As for cheating, I don’t think if they cheat twice it can be the same way. Trump winning comfortably at a late hour bedtime and then waking up and finding a Biden electoral domination with the map radically changed will remove what little legitimacy remains and may lead to the water boiling over. That means they need to understand how many votes they need to inject in almost real time. That requires real-time understanding of current vote totals and the delta. That is something computers are very good at. Alternatively they make a very accurate prediction of the shortfall ahead of time and the demographic information about hours clusters of groups vote. This latter approach is very risky but not impossible.Whatever happens, keep living for the future of Our people in post-America by taking a course of prudent and disciplined action.

        I’m very encouraged by the pall of silence from my shitlib friends in the wake of last night’s thrashing, in sharp contrast to their triumphalism after Trump didn’t prepare for his debate.  I think JD may very well have saved the day.

        I think others have said this, but, my take: Walz was selected because the election will probablydisproportionatelybe decided by blue-color/lower middle class non-urban white people in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and the Dems imagined such people would be swayed by Waltz’ hunting-in-cammo, ex-Army, football-game-attending, corn-dog-eating, changing-an-air-filter drag show persona.But, real people like that might vote Dem for vestigial economic reasons (maybe the next town over was decimated after Mitt Romney’s Bain Capital raided it), but, as Z said, they do not become Dem politicians.  The only white Christians who do are corrupt, perverts, or both.Trump was deliberating VP choices, and then picked Vance the day after he was shot.  I think he did so because Vance was the least-RINO-y of his options, and he chose him as an FU to the establishment.  Vance is also removal insurance – if the VP selection had been Rubio or Tim Scott or some other controllable uniparty empty suit, congress would quickly impeach Trump and/or the security services would kill him.

        “Vance looked like the guy who would take over the populist movement after Trump retires”This!  If there is any chance—and I’m not saying there is—Trump does not have enough time to finish the job of righting the ship of State, much less bringing it into a safe harbor.  That’s up to his successor.  Now we will see if Trump is really thinking that far ahead and toward the good of the Nation, rather than himself, with Vance.  It’s been a long time since Rep’s had a 12 year run in the Executive office.  To that effect, Vance must be shown to be “Presidential” and the only logical successor to Trump.It would be wonderful, but extremely odd, if Vance was given any significant duties as VP such that he is seen as the only successor to the President and a leader in his own right.  That is the optimist in me raising its “hopeful” head again.The pessimist in me says that Trump (part deux) is the last “hurrah” before (Leftist) demographics exert its unbreakable stranglehold hold on the electorate.  As with MX and the USSR, this most likely will last 50-70 years, or two to three generations.  At that point my crystal ball is too foggy to read.

        if Trump does win the electioni think you mean if he’s installed as president.I didn’t even know the debate was happening , which I’m sort of proud of, but I tuned in when I saw it streaming live on YouTube. Totally worthless. They seemed to be pretending that they were serious people and this is a serious “country “. Both had a “I’m going to rise above the shouting “ act going on which looked fake.Vance did ok. I’m glad he say trump lost the election. But he lost an opportunity to tell the world that the democratsencouraged months of destructionrioting and then faked a right wing riot. He knew that was coming and could have had something ready.

        Walz is a goofy old white guy from a goofy white state (for the current demographics, anyway) and I didn’t think he did that badly. He seems like a decent, if completely misguided, guy. He just doesn’t debate well, and is not used to the public spotlight like that. If you put me on that stage, I’m sure Zman would be saying today that I’m an idiot weirdo.But clearly Vance dominated. I got lost in his dreamy A10’s a few times, and now I’m questioning my sexuality this morning. Vance is better than Trump. I hope Trump doesn’t f**k up or tire the country out if he wins, because Vance should be President one day.
